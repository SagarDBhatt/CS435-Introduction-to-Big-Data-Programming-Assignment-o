Anarchism<====>12<====>AnarchismAnarchism is a political philosophy that advocates self-governed societies based on voluntary institutions.  These are often described as stateless societies,although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-hierarchical or free associations.   Anarchism holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful. The following sources cite anarchism as a political philosophy:    Slevin, Carl.  "Anarchism. " The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics.  Ed.  Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan.  Oxford University Press, 2003. 

Autism<====>25<====>AutismAutism is a developmental disorder characterized by troubles with social interaction and communication.   Often there is also restricted and repetitive behavior.   Parents usually notice signs in the first two or three years of their child's life.   These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then worsen.Autism is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.Risk factors include certain infections during pregnancy such as rubella as well as valproic acid, alcohol, or cocaine use during pregnancy. 

Albedo<====>39<====>Albedo  Albedo ( ) (Latin albedo, "whiteness") is the measure of diffusive reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation received by a body, for example a planetary body such as Earth.  It is dimensionless and measured on a scale from zero (corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation) to one (corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation). Surface albedo is defined as the ratio of irradiance reflected to the irradiance received by a surface.  The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface. 

A<====>290<====>A  A (named  , plural As, A's, as, a's or aes ) is the first letter and the first vowel of the ISO basic Latin alphabet.   It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter alpha, from which it derives.    The upper-case version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar.  The lower-case version can be written in two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ.  The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in italic type. 

Alabama<====>303<====>Alabama Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States.  It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west.

Alabama is nicknamed the Yellowhammer State, after the state bird.  Alabama is also known as the "Heart of Dixie" and the "Cotton State". 

Achilles<====>305<====>Achilles   In Greek mythology, Achilles or Achilleus ( ,  ;  , Akhilleus  ) was a Greek hero of the Trojan War and the central character and greatest warrior of Homer's Iliad.  His mother was the immortal nereid Thetis, and his father, the mortal Peleus, was the king of the Myrmidons. Achilles' most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero Hector outside the gates of Troy.  Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the Iliad, other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris, who shot him in the heel with an arrow. 

Abraham Lincoln<====>307<====>Abraham Lincoln Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American statesman and lawyer who served as the 16th President of the United States from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865.  Lincoln led the United States through its Civil War—its bloodiest war and perhaps its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis.    In doing so, he preserved the Union, paved the way for the abolition of slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the economy. Born in Hodgenville, Kentucky, Lincoln grew up on the western frontier in Kentucky and Indiana. 

Aristotle<====>308<====>Aristotle    Aristotle ( ;    Aristotélēs,  ; 384–322 BC)  was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece.  His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian.   At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens  and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c.  347 BC).  His writings cover many subjects – including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, politics and government – and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy.

Academy Award for Best Production Design<====>316<====>Academy Award for Best Production Design  The Academy Award for Best Production Design recognizes achievement for art direction in film.  The category's original name was Best Art Direction, but was changed to its current name in 2012 for the 85th Academy Awards.This change resulted from the Art Director's branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) being renamed the Designer's branch.  Since 1947, the award is shared with the set decorator(s).  It is awarded to the best interior design in a film.  The films below are listed with their production year (for example, the 2000 Academy Award for Best Art Direction is given to a film from 1999). 

Academy Awards<====>324<====>Academy AwardsThe Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars,  are a set of 24 awards for artistic and technical merit in the American film industry, given annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), to recognize excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the Academy's voting membership.  The various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette, officially called the "Academy Award of Merit", which has become commonly known by its nickname "Oscar".  The sculpture was created by George Stanley.   The awards, first presented in 1929 at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, are overseen by AMPAS. 

Actrius<====>330<====>Actrius   Actresses (Catalan: Actrius) is a 1997 Catalan language Spanish drama film produced and directed by Ventura Pons and based on the award-winning stage play E. R.  by Josep Maria Benet i Jornet.  The film has no male actors, with all roles played by females. The film was produced in 1996.    SynopsisIn order to prepare herself to play a role commemorating the life of legendary actress Empar Ribera, young actress (Mercè Pons) interviews three established actresses who had been the Ribera's pupils: the international diva Glòria Marc (Núria Espert), the television star Assumpta Roca (Rosa Maria Sardà), and dubbing director Maria Caminal (Anna Lizaran).

It was originally published in 1986, followed by a tenth anniversary edition in 1996, and a 25th anniversary edition in 2012.  Over three million copies have been sold.A special numbered and signed anniversary edition was also published in 1996, with an embossed gold jacket.  SynopsisAnimalia is an alliterative alphabet book and contains twenty-six illustrations, one for each letter of the alphabet.  Each illustration features an animal from the animal kingdom (A is for alligator, B is for butterfly, etc. 

International Atomic Time<====>334<====>International Atomic Time  International Atomic Time (TAI, from the French name   ) is a high-precision atomic coordinate time standard based on the notional passage of proper time on Earth's geoid.   It is the principal realisation of Terrestrial Time (except for a fixed offset of epoch).  It is also the basis for Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earth's surface.    when another leap second was added,    TAI is exactly 37 seconds ahead of UTC.  The 37 seconds results from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972, plus 27 leap seconds in UTC since 1972. 

Altruism<====>336<====>Altruism  Altruism or selflessness is the principle or practice of concern for the welfare of others.  It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews, though the concept of "others" toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions.  Altruism or selflessness is the opposite of selfishness.  The word was coined by the French philosopher Auguste Comte in French, as altruisme, for an antonym of egoism.    He derived it from the Italian altrui, which in turn was derived from Latin alteri, meaning "other people" or "somebody else". 

Ayn Rand<====>339<====>Ayn Rand   Ayn Rand ( ;  born Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum  ,  ;   – March 6, 1982) was a Russian-American novelist, philosopher,   playwright, and screenwriter.  She is known for her two best-selling novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and for developing a philosophical system she called Objectivism.  Educated in Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926.  She had a play produced on Broadway in 1935 and 1936.  After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead.  In 1957, Rand published her best-known work, the novel Atlas Shrugged. 

Alain Connes<====>340<====>Alain Connes   Alain Connes ( ; born 1 April 1947) is a French mathematician, currently Professor at the Collège de France, IHÉS, Ohio State University and Vanderbilt University.  He was an Invited Professor at the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers (2000).  WorkAlain Connes studies operator algebras.  In his early work on von Neumann algebras in the 1970s, he succeeded in obtaining the almost complete classification of injective factors.  Following this he made contributions in operator K-theory and index theory, which culminated in the Baum–Connes conjecture.  He also introduced cyclic cohomology in the early 1980s as a first step in the study of noncommutative differential geometry.

Anthropology<====>569<====>Anthropology   Anthropology is the study of various aspects of humans within past and present societies. Social anthropology and cultural anthropology    study the norms and values of societies.  Linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life.  Biological or physical anthropology    studies the  biological development of humans. Archaeology, which studies past human cultures through investigation of physical evidence, is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the United States,  while in Europe, it is viewed as a discipline in its own right, or grouped under other related disciplines such as history. 

Agricultural science<====>572<====>Agricultural science   Agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture.  (Veterinary science, but not animal science, is often excluded from the definition. ) Agriculture, agricultural science, and agronomyThe three terms are often confused.  However, they cover different concepts:Agriculture is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use.  Agriculture concerns techniques, including the application of agronomic research. Agronomy is research and development related to studying and improving plant-based crops. 

Alchemy<====>573<====>Alchemy  Alchemy is a philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout Europe, Africa and Asia.  It aimed to purify, mature, and perfect certain objects.    .    Common aims were chrysopoeia, the transmutation of "base metals" (e. g. , lead) into "noble metals" (particularly gold); the creation of an elixir of immortality; the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease; and the development of an alkahest, a universal solvent.   The perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and, in the Hellenistic and western tradition, the achievement of gnosis. 

Astronomer<====>580<====>Astronomer An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside the scope of Earth.  They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects — either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data, or in theoretical astronomy.  Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies.  There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole. Astronomers usually fit into two types: observational and theoretical. 

ASCII<====>586<====>ASCII   ASCII (   ),abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard for electronic communication.  ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices.  Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters. ASCII is the traditional name for the encoding system; the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) prefers the updated name US-ASCII, which clarifies that this system was developed in the US and based on the typographical symbols predominantly in use there.  Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) (May 14, 2007). 

Animation<====>593<====>Animation    Animation is a dynamic medium in which images or objects are manipulated to appear as moving images.  In traditional animation the images were drawn (or painted) by hand on cels to be photographed and exhibited on film.  Nowadays most animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI).  Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation, while 2D computer animation can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth or faster real-time renderings.  Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts, puppets or clay figures.  The stop motion technique where live actors are used as a frame-by-frame subject is known as pixilation. 

Apollo<====>594<====>Apollo    Apollo (Attic, Ionic, and Homeric Greek:  , Apollōn (   ); Doric:  , Apellōn; Arcadocypriot:  , Apeilōn; Aeolic:  , Aploun;  ) is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology.  The ideal of the kouros (a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music, truth and prophecy, healing, the sun and light, plague, poetry, and more.  Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto, and has a twin sister, the chaste huntress Artemis.

BBC.  Retrieved May 15, 2010.   Agassi has been called the greatest service returner ever to play the game. 

Austroasiatic languages<====>597<====>Austroasiatic languages    The Austroasiatic languages,  in recent classifications synonymous with Mon–Khmer,  are a large language family of Mainland Southeast Asia, also scattered throughout India, Bangladesh, Nepal and the southern border of China, with around 117 million speakers.   The name Austroasiatic comes from the Latin words for "South" and "Asia", hence "South Asia".  Of these languages, only Vietnamese, Khmer, and Mon have a long-established recorded history, and only Vietnamese and Khmer have official status as modern national languages (in Vietnam and Cambodia, respectively).  On the subnational level, Khasi has official status in Meghalaya while Santhali, Ho and Mundari are official languages of Jharkhand. 

Afroasiatic languages<====>599<====>Afroasiatic languages   Afroasiatic (Afro-Asiatic), also known as Afrasian and traditionally as Hamito-Semitic (Chamito-Semitic)  or Semito-Hamitic,  is a large language family of about 300 languages and dialects.  Ethnologue family tree for Afroasiatic languages  It includes languages spoken predominantly in West Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa and parts of the Sahel. Afroasiatic languages have over 350 million native speakers, the fourth largest number of any language family (after Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan and Niger–Congo).   The phylum has six branches: Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, Egyptian, Omotic and Semitic.  By far the most widely spoken Afroasiatic language is Arabic. 

Andorra<====>600<====>AndorraAndorra ( ;  ,  ), officially the Principality of Andorra ( ), also called the Principality of the Valleys of Andorra  ( ), is a sovereign landlocked microstate in Southwestern Europe, located in the eastern Pyrenees mountains and bordered by France in the north, and the Spanish autonomous community of Catalonia in the south.  Created under a charter in 988 , the present principality was formed in 1278.  It is known as a principality as it is a diarchy headed by two Co-Princes the Catholic Bishop of Urgell in Spain and the President of France. 

Arithmetic mean<====>612<====>Arithmetic mean   In mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean ( , stress on third syllable of "arithmetic"), or simply the mean or average when the context is clear, is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the number of numbers in the collection.   The collection is often a set of results of an experiment, or a set of results from a survey.  The term "arithmetic mean" is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics because it helps distinguish it from other means, such as the geometric mean and the harmonic mean. In addition to mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean is used frequently in fields such as economics, sociology, and history, and it is used in almost every academic field to some extent. 

American Football Conference<====>615<====>American Football Conference   The American Football Conference (AFC) is one of the two conferences of the National Football League (NFL), the highest professional level of American football in the United States.  This conference and its counterpart, the National Football Conference (NFC), currently contain 16 teams each, making up the 32 teams of the NFL.  Both conferences were created as part of the 1970 merger with the rival American Football League (AFL), with all ten of the former AFL teams and three NFL teams forming the AFC, and the remaining thirteen NFL clubs forming the NFC.  A series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger, thus making the current total 16 clubs per each conference. 

Animal Farm<====>620<====>Animal Farm Animal Farm is an allegorical novella by George Orwell, first published in England on 17 August 1945.  According to Orwell, the book reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union.   Orwell, a democratic socialist,  was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to Moscow-directed Stalinism, an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the Spanish Civil War.   The Soviet Union, he believed, had become a brutal dictatorship, built upon a cult of personality and enforced by a reign of terror. 

Amphibian<====>621<====>Amphibian    Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia.  Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia.  They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems.  Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this.  The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs.  Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. 

Alaska<====>624<====>Alaska   Alaska ( ) is a U. S.  state located in the northwest extremity of North America.  The Canadian administrative divisions of British Columbia and Yukon border the state to the east, its most extreme western part is Attu Island, and it has a maritime border with Russia to the west across the Bering Strait.  To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seas–the southern parts of the Arctic Ocean.  The Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest.  It is the largest state in the United States by area and the seventh largest subnational division in the world. 

Agriculture<====>627<====>AgricultureAgriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life.Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization.  The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science.  The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies.  Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural method. 

Aldous Huxley<====>628<====>Aldous Huxley   Aldous Leonard Huxley ( ; 26 July 1894 – 22 November 1963) was an English writer, novelist, philosopher,and prominent member of the Huxley family.  He graduated from Balliol College at the University of Oxford with a first class honours in English literature. The author of nearly fifty books,   he was best known for his novels including Brave New World, set in a dystopian future; for non-fiction works, such as The Doors of Perception, which recalls experiences when taking a psychedelic drug; and a wide-ranging output of essays.  Early in his career Huxley edited the magazine Oxford Poetry and published short stories and poetry.

Algae<====>633<====>Algae   Algae ( ; singular alga  ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms that are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic.  Included organisms range from unicellular microalgae genera, such as Chlorella and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as  the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length.  Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants.  The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, Spirogyra and the stoneworts. 

Analysis of variance<====>634<====>Analysis of variance Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a collection of statistical models and their associated procedures (such as "variation" among and between groups) used to analyze the differences among group means.  ANOVA was developed by statistician and evolutionary biologist Ronald Fisher.  In the ANOVA setting, the observed variance in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation.  In its simplest form, ANOVA provides a statistical test of whether or not the means of several groups are equal, and therefore generalizes the t-test to more than two groups.    ANOVAs are useful for comparing (testing) three or more means (groups or variables) for statistical significance. 

Alkane<====>639<====>Alkane  In organic chemistry, an alkane, or paraffin (a historical name that also has other meanings), is an acyclic saturated hydrocarbon.  In other words, an alkane consists of hydrogen and carbon atoms arranged in a tree structure in which all the carbon-carbon bonds are single.Alkanes have the general chemical formula   n   2n+2 .  The alkanes range in complexity from the simplest case of methane, CH 4  where n = 1 (sometimes called the parent molecule), to arbitrarily large molecules.   Besides this standard definition by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, in some authors' usage the term alkane is applied to any saturated hydrocarbon, including those that are either monocyclic (i. 

Appellate procedure in the United States<====>640<====>Appellate procedure in the United States United States appellate procedure involves the rules and regulations for filing appeals in state courts and federal courts.  The nature of an appeal can vary greatly depending on the type of case and the rules of the court in the jurisdiction where the case was prosecuted.  There are many types of standard of review for appeals, such as de novo and abuse of discretion.  However, most appeals begin when a party files a petition for review to a higher court for the purpose of overturning the lower court's decision. An appellate court is a court that hears cases on appeal from another court. 

Answer (law)<====>642<====>Answer (law)    In law, an Answer was originally a solemn assertion in opposition to someone or something, and thus generally any counter-statement or defense, a reply to a question or response, or objection, or a correct solution of a problem.    In the common law, an Answer is the first pleading by a defendant, usually filed and served upon the plaintiff within a certain strict time limit after a civil complaint or criminal information or indictment has been served upon the defendant.   It may have been preceded by an optional "pre-answer" motion to dismiss or demurrer; if such a motion is unsuccessful, the defendant must file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse default judgment. 

Appellate court<====>643<====>Appellate court   An appellate court, commonly called an appeals court, court of appeals (American English),  appeal court (British English), court of second instance or second instance court, is any court of law that is empowered to hear an appeal of a trial court or other lower tribunal.  In most jurisdictions, the court system is divided into at least three levels: the trial court, which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case; at least one intermediate appellate court; and a supreme court (or court of last resort) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts. 

Arraignment<====>649<====>Arraignment Arraignment is a formal reading of a criminal charging document in the presence of the defendant to inform the defendant of the charges against him or her.  In response to arraignment, the accused is expected to enter a plea.  Acceptable pleas vary among jurisdiction but they generally include "guilty", "not guilty", and the peremptory pleas (or pleas in bar) setting out reasons why a trial cannot proceed.  Pleas of "nolo contendere" (no contest) and the "Alford plea" are allowed in some circumstances. AustraliaIn Australia, arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial, and involves the clerk of the court reading out the indictment. 

America the Beautiful<====>651<====>America the Beautiful"America the Beautiful" is an American patriotic song.  The lyrics were written by Katharine Lee Bates, and the music was composed by church organist and choirmaster Samuel A.  Ward at Grace Episcopal Church in Newark, New Jersey.  Bates originally wrote the words as a poem, "Pikes Peak", first published in the Fourth of July edition of the church periodical The Congregationalist in 1895.  At that time, the poem was titled "America" for publication. Ward had originally written the music, "Materna", for the hymn "O Mother dear, Jerusalem" in 1882, though it was not first published until 1892. 

Assistive technology<====>653<====>Assistive technology  Assistive technology is an umbrella term that includes assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices for people with disabilities and also includes the process used in selecting, locating, and using them.  People who have disabilities often have difficulty performing activities of daily living (ADLs) independently, or even with assistance.  ADLs are self-care activities that include toileting, mobility (ambulation), eating, bathing, dressing and grooming.  Assistive technology can ameliorate the effects of disabilities that limit the ability to perform ADLs.  Assistive technology promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks that they were formerly unable to accomplish, or had great difficulty accomplishing, by providing enhancements to, or changing methods of interacting with, the technology needed to accomplish such tasks. 

Abacus<====>655<====>Abacus    The abacus (plural abaci or abacuses), also called a counting frame, is a calculating tool that was in use in Europe, China and Russia, centuries before the adoption of the written Hindu–Arabic numeral system.   The exact origin of the abacus is still unknown.  Today, abaci are often constructed as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires, but originally they were beans or stones moved in grooves in sand or on tablets of wood, stone, or metal. Abaci come in different designs.  Some designs, like the bead frame consisting of beads divided into tens, are used mainly to teach arithmetic, although they remain popular in the post-Soviet states as a tool. 

Acid<====>656<====>Acid  An acid is a molecule or ion capable of donating a hydron (proton or hydrogen ion H + ), or, alternatively, capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair (a Lewis acid).  IUPAC Gold Book - acid The first category of acids is the proton donors or Brønsted acids.  In the special case of aqueous solutions, proton donors form the hydronium ion H 3 O +  and are known as Arrhenius acids.  Brønsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents.  A Brønsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H + . 

Asphalt<====>657<====>Asphalt    Asphalt ( ), also known as bitumen (UK English:  ,  US English:  )  is a sticky, black, and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum.  It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product, and is classed as a pitch.  Before the 20th century, the term asphaltum was also used.    Full text at Internet Archive (archive. org)  The word is derived from the Ancient Greek ἄσφαλτος ásphaltos.  The primary use (70%) of asphalt is in road construction, where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with aggregate particles to create asphalt concrete. 

American National Standards Institute<====>659<====>American National Standards Institute   The American National Standards Institute (ANSI,    ) is a private non-profit organization that oversees the development of voluntary consensus standards for products, services, processes, systems, and personnel in the United States.   The organization also coordinates U. S.  standards with international standards so that American products can be used worldwide. ANSI accredits standards that are developed by representatives of other standards organizations, government agencies, consumer groups, companies, and others.  These standards ensure that the characteristics and performance of products are consistent, that people use the same definitions and terms, and that products are tested the same way. 

Apollo 11<====>662<====>Apollo 11 Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that landed the first two humans on the Moon.  Mission commander Neil Armstrong and pilot Buzz Aldrin, both American, landed the lunar module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 UTC.  Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours after landing on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later.  They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected   of lunar material to bring back to Earth.  Michael Collins piloted the command module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. 

Apollo 8<====>663<====>Apollo 8   Apollo 8, the second manned spaceflight mission in the United States Apollo space program, was launched on December 21, 1968, and became the first manned spacecraft to leave Earth orbit, reach the Earth's Moon, orbit it and return safely to Earth.  The three-astronaut crew — Commander Frank Borman, Command Module Pilot James Lovell, and Lunar Module Pilot William Anders — became the first humans to: travel beyond low Earth orbit; see Earth as a whole planet; enter the gravity well of another celestial body (Earth's moon); orbit another celestial body (Earth's moon); directly see the far side of the Moon with their own eyes; witness an Earthrise; escape the gravity of another celestial body (Earth's moon); and re-enter the gravitational well of Earth. 

Astronaut<====>664<====>Astronaut    An astronaut or cosmonaut is a person trained by a human spaceflight program to command, pilot, or serve as a crew member of a spacecraft.  Although generally reserved for professional space travelers, the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space, including scientists, politicians, journalists, and tourists.  Starting in the 1950s up to 2002, astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments, either by the military or by civilian space agencies.  With the suborbital flight of the privately funded SpaceShipOne in 2004, a new category of astronaut was created: the commercial astronaut. 

A Modest Proposal<====>665<====>A Modest Proposal   A Modest Proposal For preventing the Children of Poor People From being a Burthen to Their Parents or Country, and For making them Beneficial to the Publick ,    commonly referred to as A Modest Proposal, is a Juvenalian satirical essay written and published anonymously by Jonathan Swift in 1729.   Swift suggested that the impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies.  His work encouraged positive development for those that suffered from famishment and financial maladies, and urged the aristocratic landlords to lower their taxes, so as to not further starve the country of its food and coin. 

Alkali metal<====>666<====>Alkali metal   The alkali metals are a group (column) in the periodic table consisting of the chemical elements lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), The symbols Na and K for sodium and potassium are derived from their Latin names, natrium and kalium; these are still the names for the elements in some languages, such as German and Russian.   rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs),  and francium (Fr).  This group lies in the s-block of the periodic table of elements as all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an s-orbital: this shared electron configuration results in their having very similar characteristic properties. 

Alphabet<====>670<====>AlphabetAn alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that is used to write one or more languages based upon the general principle that the letters represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language.  This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographies (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit). The Proto-Canaanite script, later known as the Phoenician alphabet, is the first fully phonemic script.  Thus the Phoenician alphabet is considered to be the first alphabet. 

Atomic number<====>673<====>Atomic number  The atomic number or proton number (symbol Z) of a chemical element is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom.  It is identical to the charge number of the nucleus.  The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element.  In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons. The sum of the atomic number Z and the number of neutrons, N, gives the mass number A of an atom.  Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass (and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes) and the mass defect of nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass, the atomic mass of any atom, when expressed in unified atomic mass units (making a quantity called the "relative isotopic mass"), is within 1% of the whole number A. 

Anatomy<====>674<====>Anatomy    Anatomy (Greek anatomē, “dissection”) is the branch of biology concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their parts.   Anatomy is a branch of natural science dealing with the structural organization of living things.  It is an old science, having its beginnings in prehistoric times.   Anatomy is inherently tied to  embryology, comparative anatomy, evolutionary biology, and phylogeny,    as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated over immediate (embryology) and long (evolution) timescales.   Human anatomy is one of the basic essential sciences of medicine. 

Affirming the consequent<====>675<====>Affirming the consequent Affirming the consequent, sometimes called converse error, fallacy of the converse or confusion of necessity and sufficiency, is a formal fallacy of inferring the converse from the original statement.  The corresponding argument has the general form: \frac{P \to Q, Q}{\therefore P} An argument of this form is invalid, i. e. , the conclusion can be false even when statements 1 and 2 are true.   Since P was never asserted as the only sufficient condition for Q, other factors could account for Q (while P was false).   To put it differently, if P implies Q, the only inference that can be made is non-Q implies non-P. 

Andrei Tarkovsky<====>676<====>Andrei Tarkovsky   Andrei Arsenyevich Tarkovsky ( ; 4 April 1932 – 29 December 1986) was a Soviet filmmaker, writer, film editor, film theorist, theatre and opera director. Tarkovsky's films include Ivan's Childhood (1962), Andrei Rublev (1966), Solaris (1972), Mirror (1975), and Stalker (1979).  He directed the first five of his seven feature films in the Soviet Union; his last two films, Nostalghia (1983) and The Sacrifice (1986), were produced in Italy and Sweden, respectively.  His work is characterized by long takes, unconventional dramatic structure, distinctly authored use of cinematography, and spiritual and metaphysical themes. Tarkovsky's works Andrei Rublev, Solaris, Mirror, and Stalker are regularly listed among the greatest films of all time. 

Ambiguity<====>677<====>AmbiguityAmbiguity is a type of uncertainty of meaning in which several interpretations are  .  It is thus an attribute of any idea or statement whose intended meaning cannot be definitively resolved according to a rule or process with a finite number of steps.  (The  - part of the term reflects an idea of "two", as in "two meanings". )The concept of ambiguity is generally contrasted with vagueness.  In ambiguity, specific and distinct interpretations are permitted (although some may not be immediately obvious), whereas with information that is vague, it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity. 

Aardvark<====>680<====>Aardvark    The aardvark (   ; Orycteropus afer) is a medium-sized, burrowing, nocturnal mammal native to Africa.It is the only living species of the order Tubulidentata,although other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known.  Unlike other insectivores, it has a long pig-like snout, which is used to sniff out food.  It roams over most of the southern two-thirds of the African continent, avoiding areas that are mainly rocky.  A nocturnal feeder, it subsists on ants and termites, which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs. 

Aardwolf<====>681<====>Aardwolf  The aardwolf (Proteles cristata) is a small, insectivorous mammal, native to East and Southern Africa.  Its name means "earth wolf" in Afrikaans and Dutch.   It is also called "maanhaar jackal"    (Afrikaans for "mane jackal") or civet hyena, based on its habit of secreting substances from its anal gland, a characteristic shared with the civet.   The aardwolf is in the same family as the hyena.  Unlike many of its relatives in the order Carnivora, the aardwolf does not hunt large animals.  It eats insects, mainly termites – one aardwolf can eat about 250,000 termites during a single night, using its long, sticky tongue to capture them. 

Adobe<====>682<====>Adobe    Adobe ( ,  ;   ) is a building material made from earth and other organic materials.  Adobe means mudbrick in Spanish, but in some English-speaking regions of Spanish heritage, the term is used to refer to any kind of earth construction.  Most adobe buildings are similar in appearance to cob and rammed earth buildings.  Adobe is among the earliest building materials, and is used throughout the world. DescriptionAdobe bricks are most often made into units weighing less than 100 pounds and small enough that they can quickly air dry individually without cracking. 

Adventure<====>683<====>Adventure  An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience.  It may also be a bold, usually risky undertaking, with an uncertain outcome.   Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting or participating in extreme sports.  The term also broadly refers to any enterprise that is potentially fraught with physical, financial or psychological risk, such as a business venture, or other major life undertakings. The word adventuress can mean a female who enjoys or partakes in adventures, but (particularly in older literature) it can also have the negative connotation of one who schemes for material advancement by the use her sexuality; a gold digger   As an instance of the latter the Oxford English Dictionary cites "Our Adventuress had the pickings of a few Feathers from an old Gentleman who fell in Love with her". 

Asia<====>689<====>Asia    Asia ( ) is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres.  It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa.  Asia covers an area of  , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8. 7% of the Earth's total surface area.  The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population,  was the site of many of the first civilizations.  Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements, as well as vast barely populated regions. 

Aruba<====>690<====>Aruba    Aruba (   ;  ) is an island and a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the southern Caribbean Sea, located about   west of the main part of the Lesser Antilles and north of the coast of Venezuela.  It measures   long from its northwestern to its southeastern end and   across at its widest point.   Together with Bonaire and Curaçao, Aruba forms a group referred to as the ABC islands.  Collectively, Aruba and the other Dutch islands in the Caribbean are often called the Dutch Caribbean. 

Articles of Confederation<====>691<====>Articles of Confederation   The Articles of Confederation, formally the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, was an agreement among the 13 original states of the United States of America that served as its first constitution.   It was approved, after much debate (between July 1776 and November 1777), by the Second Continental Congress on November 15, 1777, and sent to the states for ratification.  The Articles of Confederation came into force on March 1, 1781, after being ratified by all 13 states.  A guiding principle of the Articles was to preserve the independence and sovereignty of the states. 

Atlantic Ocean<====>698<====>Atlantic OceanThe Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about  .   It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area.  It separates the "Old World" from the "New World". The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between Eurasia and Africa to the east, and the Americas to the west.  As one component of the interconnected global ocean, it is connected in the north to the Arctic Ocean, to the Pacific Ocean in the southwest, the Indian Ocean in the southeast, and the Southern Ocean in the south (other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to Antarctica). 

Arthur Schopenhauer<====>700<====>Arthur Schopenhauer    Arthur Schopenhauer ( ;  ; 22 February 1788 – 21 September 1860) was a German philosopher.  He is best known for his 1818 work The World as Will and Representation (expanded in 1844), wherein he characterizes the phenomenal world as the product of a blind and insatiable metaphysical will.    Proceeding from the transcendental idealism of Immanuel Kant, Schopenhauer developed an atheistic metaphysical and ethical system that has been described as an exemplary manifestation of philosophical pessimism,    rejecting the contemporaneous post-Kantian philosophies of German idealism.    Schopenhauer was among the first thinkers in Western philosophy to share and affirm significant tenets of Eastern philosophy (e. 

Angola<====>701<====>AngolaAngola ( ), officially the Republic of Angola (   ; Kikongo, Kimbundu and Umbundu: Repubilika ya Ngola), is a country in Southern Africa.  It is the seventh-largest country in Africa, bordered by Namibia to the south, the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north, Zambia to the east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west.  The exclave province of Cabinda borders the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  The capital and largest city of Angola is Luanda. Although inhabited since the Paleolithic Era, what is now Angola was molded by Portuguese colonisation. 

Demographics of Angola<====>704<====>Demographics of Angola This article is about the demographic features of the population of Angola, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population. According to 2014 census data, Angola had a population of 25,789,024 inhabitants in 2014.  Ethnically, there are three main groups, each speaking a Bantu language: the Ovimbundu who represent 37% of the population, the Ambundu with 25%, and the Bakongo 13%.  Other numerically important groups include the closely interrelated Chokwe and Lunda, the Ganguela and Nyaneka-Khumbi (in both cases classification terms that stand for a variety of small groups), the Ovambo, the Herero,  the Xindonga and scattered residual groups of San. 

Politics of Angola<====>705<====>Politics of Angola Since the adoption of a new constitution in 2010, the politics of Angola takes place in a framework of a presidential republic, whereby the President of Angola is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system.  Executive power is exercised by the government.  Legislative power is vested in the President, the government and parliament.  Angola changed from a one-party Marxist-Leninist system ruled by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), in place since independence in 1975, to a multiparty democracy based on a new constitution adopted in 1992. 

Economy of Angola<====>706<====>Economy of Angola  The Economy of Angola is one of the fastest-growing in the world, Birgitte Refslund Sørensen and Marc Vincent.  Caught Between Borders: Response Strategies of the Internally Displaced, 2001.  Page 17.   with reported annual average GDP growth of 11. 1 percent from 2001 to 2010.It is still recovering from 27 years of the civil war that plagued the country from its independence in 1975 to 2002.  Despite extensive oil and gas resources, diamonds, hydroelectric potential, and rich agricultural land, Angola remains poor, and a third of the population relies on subsistence agriculture. 

Transport in Angola<====>708<====>Transport in Angola  Transport in Angola comprises:Railways There are three separate railway lines in Angola:Luanda Railway (CFL) (northern)Benguela Railway (CFB) (central)Moçâmedes Railway (CFM) (southern)Reconstruction of these three lines began in 2005 and is expected to be completed by the end of the year 2012.  The Benguela Railway already connects to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Angolan Armed Forces<====>709<====>Angolan Armed Forces   The Angolan Armed Forces (Portuguese: Forças Armadas Angolanas) or FAA are the military of Angola. The FAA include the General Staff of the Armed Forces and three components: the Army (Exército), the Navy (Marinha de Guerra) and the National Air Force (National Air Force).  Reported total manpower in 2013 was about 107,000.  The FAA is headed by Chief of the General Staff Geraldo Sachipengo Nunda since 2010, who reports to the Minister of National Defense, currently Salviano de Jesus Sequeira. HistoryThe FAA succeeded to the previous People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) following the abortive Bicesse Accord with the Armed Forces of the Liberation of Angola (FALA), armed wing of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). 

Foreign relations of Angola<====>710<====>Foreign relations of Angola  The foreign relations of Angola are based on Angola's strong support of U. S.  foreign policy as the Angolan economy is dependent on U. S.  foreign aid. From 1975 to 1989, Angola was aligned with the Eastern bloc, in particular the Soviet Union, Libya, and Cuba.  Since then, it has focused on improving relationships with Western countries, cultivating links with other Portuguese-speaking countries, and asserting its own national interests in Central Africa through military and diplomatic intervention.  In 1993, it established formal diplomatic relations with the United States.  It has entered the Southern African Development Community as a vehicle for improving ties with its largely Anglophone neighbors to the south. 

Albert Sidney Johnston<====>711<====>Albert Sidney Johnston   Albert Sidney Johnston (February 2, 1803 – April 6, 1862) served as a general in three different armies: the Texian (i. e.  Republic of Texas) Army, the United States Army, and the Confederate States Army.  He saw extensive combat during his 34-year military career, fighting actions in the Black Hawk War, Texas War of Independence, the Mexican–American War, the Utah War, and the American Civil War. Considered by Confederate States President Jefferson Davis to be the finest general officer in the Confederacy before the later emergence of Robert E.  Lee, he was killed early in the Civil War at the Battle of Shiloh on April 6, 1862. 

Android (robot)<====>713<====>Android (robot)    An android is a humanoid robot    or synthetic organismdesigned to look and act like a human, especially one with a body having a flesh-like resemblance.   Historically, androids remained completely within the domain of science fiction where they are frequently seen in film and television.  Only recently have advancements in robot technology allowed the design of functional and realistic humanoid robots.  EtymologyThe word was coined from the Greek root ἀνδρ-, "man" (male, as opposed to anthrop-, human being) and the suffix -oid, "having the form or likeness of". 

Alberta<====>717<====>Alberta Alberta ( ) is a western province of Canada.

Actinopterygii<====>734<====>Actinopterygii   Actinopterygii  , or the ray-finned fishes, constitute a class or subclass of the bony fishes.  The ray-finned fishes are so called because their fins are webs of skin supported by bony or horny spines ("rays"), as opposed to the fleshy, lobed fins that characterize the class Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish).  These actinopterygian fin rays attach directly to the proximal or basal skeletal elements, the radials, which represent the link or connection between these fins and the internal skeleton (e. g. , pelvic and pectoral girdles). Numerically, actinopterygians are the dominant class of vertebrates, comprising nearly 99% of the over 30,000 species of fish. 

Albert Einstein<====>736<====>Albert EinsteinAlbert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born  theoretical physicist    who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).    Einstein's work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.    Einstein is best known by the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula   (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation").   He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect",  a pivotal step in the evolution of quantum theory. 

Afghanistan<====>737<====>Afghanistan  Afghanistan ( ; Pashto/Dari:  , Pashto: Afġānistān  ,  Dari: Afġānestān  ), officially the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, is a landlocked country located within South Asia and Central Asia.    Afghanistan is bordered by Pakistan in the south and east; Iran in the west; Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan in the north; and in the far northeast, China and the Pakistani-administered Gilgit-Baltistan which is claimed by India.  Its territory covers   and much of it is covered by the Hindu Kush mountain range, which experience very cold winters.

It is bound by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west and Iran to the south.  The exclave of Nakhchivan is bound by Armenia to the north and east, Iran to the south and west, and has an 11 km long border with Turkey in the north west. 

Amateur astronomy<====>748<====>Amateur astronomy   Amateur astronomy is a hobby whose participants enjoy observing or imaging celestial objects in the sky using the unaided eye, binoculars, or telescopes.  Even though scientific research may not be their primary goal, some amateur astronomers make contributions to the science of astronomy, such as by monitoring variable stars,    double stars    or occultations of stars by the Moon    or asteroids,  or by discovering transient objects, such as comets,    galactic novae    or supernovae in other galaxies.    Amateur astronomers do not use the field of astronomy as their primary source of income or support, and usually have no professional degree in astrophysics or advanced academic training in the subject. 

Aikido<====>751<====>Aikidois a modern Japanese martial art developed by Morihei Ueshiba as a synthesis of his martial studies, philosophy, and religious beliefs.  Aikido is often translated as "the way of unifying (with) life energy"  or as "the way of harmonious spirit".Ueshiba's goal was to create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury.   Aikido's techniques include: irimi (entering), turning movements (that redirect the opponent's attack momentum), various types of throws and joint locks.    Aikido derives mainly from the martial art of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but began to diverge from it in the late 1920s, partly due to Ueshiba's involvement with the Ōmoto-kyō religion. 

Art<====>752<====>Art    Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power.   In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. The oldest documented forms of art are visual arts, which include creation of images or objects in fields including today painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography, and other visual media. 

Agnostida<====>764<====>Agnostida  Agnostida is an order of arthropod which first developed near the end of the Early Cambrian period and thrived during the Middle Cambrian.  They are present in the Lower Cambrian fossil record along with trilobites from the Redlichiida, Corynexochida, and Ptychopariida orders.  The last agnostids went extinct in the Late Ordovician. SystematicsThe Agnostida are divided into two suborders — Agnostina and Eodiscina — that are then subdivided into a number of families.  As a group, agnostids are isopygous, meaning that their pygidium is similar in size and shape to their cephalon.  Most agnostid species were eyeless. 

Abortion<====>765<====>AbortionAbortion is the ending of pregnancy by removing a fetus or embryo before it can survive outside the uterus.   An abortion that occurs spontaneously is also known as a miscarriage.  An abortion may be caused purposely and is then called an induced abortion, or less frequently, "induced miscarriage".  The word abortion is often used to mean only induced abortions.  A similar procedure after the fetus could potentially survive outside the womb is known as a "late termination of pregnancy".   When allowed by law, abortion in the developed world is one of the safest procedures in medicine. 

Abstract (law)<====>766<====>Abstract (law) In law, an abstract is a brief statement that contains the most important points of a long legal document or of several related legal papers.    Abstract of title The Abstract of Title, used in real estate transactions, is the more common form of abstract.  An abstract of title lists all the owners of a piece of land, a house, or a building before it came into possession of the present owner.  The abstract also records all deeds, wills, mortgages, and other documents that affect ownership of the property.  An abstract describes a chain of transfers from owner to owner and any agreements by former owners that are binding on later owners. 

American Revolutionary War<====>771<====>American Revolutionary War The American Revolutionary War (1775 1783), also known as the American War of Independence,  was a global war that began as a conflict between Great Britain and her Thirteen Colonies which declared independence as the United States of America.  After 1765, growing philosophical and political differences strained the relationship between Great Britain and its colonies.  Patriot protests against taxation without representation followed the Stamp Act and escalated into boycotts, which culminated in 1773 with the Sons of Liberty destroying a shipment of tea in Boston Harbor.  Britain responded by closing Boston Harbor and passing a series of punitive measures against Massachusetts Bay Colony. 

Ampere<====>772<====>Ampere  The ampere (symbol: A),  often shortened to "amp", SI supports only the use of symbols and deprecates the use of abbreviations for units.    is the base unit of electric current in the  International System of Units (SI). It is named after André-Marie Ampère (1775–1836), French mathematician and physicist, considered the father of electrodynamics. SI defines the ampere in terms of other base units by measuring the electromagnetic force between electrical conductors carrying electric current.  The earlier CGS measurement system had two different definitions of current, one essentially the same as the SI's and the other using electric charge as the base unit, with the unit of charge defined by measuring the force between two charged metal plates. 

Algorithm<====>775<====>Algorithm  In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (   ) is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems.  Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing and automated reasoning tasks. An algorithm is an effective method that can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time  and in a well-defined formal language  for calculating a function.   Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty),  the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite  number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output"  and terminating at a final ending state. 

Annual plant<====>777<====>Annual plant An annual plant is a plant that completes its life cycle, from germination to the production of seeds, within one year, and then dies.  Summer annuals germinate during spring or early summer and mature by autumn of the same year.  Winter annuals germinate during the autumn and mature during the spring or summer of the following calendar year.  One seed-to-seed life cycle for an annual can occur in as little as a month in some species, though most last several months.  Oilseed rapa can go from seed-to-seed in about five weeks under a bank of fluorescent lamps. 

Anthophyta<====>779<====>Anthophyta The anthophytes were thought    to be a clade comprising plants bearing flower-like structures.   The group contained the angiosperms - the extant flowering plants, such as roses and grasses - as well as the Gnetales and the extinct Bennettitales.  Detailed morphological and molecular studies have shown that the group is not actually monophyletic, with proposed floral homologies of the gnetophytes and the angiosperms having evolved in parallel.    This makes it easier to reconcile molecular clock data that suggests that the angiosperms diverged from the gymnosperms around  .    Some more recent studies have used the word anthophyte to describe a group which includes the angiosperms and a variety of fossils (glossopterids, Pentoxylon, Bennettitales, and Caytonia), but not the Gnetales. 

Mouthwash<====>782<====>Mouthwash   Mouthwash, mouth rinse, oral rinse or mouth bath,    is a liquid which is held in the mouth passively or swilled around the mouth by contraction of the perioral muscles and/or movement of the head, and may be gargled, where the head is tilted back and the liquid bubbled at the back of the mouth. Usually mouthwashes are antiseptic solutions intended to reduce the microbial load in the oral cavity, although other mouthwashes might be given for other reasons such as for their analgesic, anti-inflammatory or anti-fungal action.  Additionally, some rinses act as saliva substitutes to neutralize acid and keep the mouth moist in xerostomia (dry mouth). 

Alexander the Great<====>783<====>Alexander the Great  Alexander III of Macedon (20/21 July 356 BC – 10/11 June 323 BC), commonly known as Alexander the Great ( , Aléxandros ho Mégas  ), was a king (basileus) of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon  and a member of the Argead dynasty.  He was born in Pella in 356 BC and succeeded his father Philip II to the throne at the age of twenty.  He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, and he created one of the largest empires of the ancient world by the age of thirty, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. 

Alfred Korzybski<====>784<====>Alfred Korzybski  Alfred Habdank Skarbek Korzybski ( ; July 3, 1879 – March 1, 1950) was a Polish-American independent scholar who developed a field called general semantics, which he viewed as both distinct from, and more encompassing than, the field of semantics.  He argued that human knowledge of the world is limited both by the human nervous system and the languages humans have developed, and thus no one can have direct access to reality, given that the most we can know is that which is filtered through the brain's responses to reality.  His best known dictum is "The map is not the territory". 

Asteroids (video game)<====>785<====>Asteroids (video game)   Asteroids is an arcade space shooter released in November 1979    by Atari, Inc.  and designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh.  The player controls a spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers.  The object of the game is to shoot and destroy asteroids and saucers while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire.  The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases. Asteroids was one of the first major hits of the golden age of arcade games. 

Asparagales<====>786<====>Asparagales   Asparagales (asparagoid lilies) is an order of plants in modern classification systems such as the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Web.  The order takes its name from the type family Asparagaceae and is placed in the monocots amongst the lilioid monocots.  The order has only recently been recognized in classification systems.  It was first put forward by Huber in 1977 and later taken up in the Dahlgren system of 1985 and then the APG in 1998, 2003 and 2009.  Before this, many of its families were assigned to the old order Liliales, a very large order containing almost all monocots with colourful tepals and lacking starch in their endosperm. 

Alismatales<====>787<====>Alismatales  The Alismatales (alismatids) are an order of flowering plants including about 4500 species.  Plants assigned to this order are mostly tropical or aquatic.  Some grow in fresh water, some in marine habitats. DescriptionThe Alismatales comprise herbaceous flowering plants of aquatic and marshy habitats, and the only monocots known to have green embryos other than the Amaryllidaceae.  They also include the only marine angiosperms.   The flowers are usually arranged in inflorescences, and the mature seeds lack endosperm. Both marine and freshwater forms include those with staminate flowers that detach from the parent plant and float to the surface where they become pollinated. 

Apiales<====>788<====>Apiales  The Apiales are an order of flowering plants.  The families are those recognized in the APG III system.   This is typical of the newer classifications, though there is some slight variation and in particular, the Torriceliaceae may be divided.  Gregory M.  Plunkett, Gregory T.  Chandler, Porter P.  Lowry, Steven M.  Pinney, and Taylor S.  Sprenkle (2004).  "Recent advances in understanding Apiales and a revised classification".  South African Journal of Botany 70(3):371-381.  Under this definition, well-known members include carrots, celery, parsley, and Hedera helix (English ivy). The order Apiales is placed within the asterid group of eudicots as circumscribed by the APG III system. 

Asterales<====>789<====>Asterales   Asterales    is an order of dicotyledonous flowering plants that includes the large family Asteraceae (or Compositae) known for composite flowers made of florets, and ten families related to the Asteraceae.  The order is a cosmopolite (plants found throughout most of the world including desert and frigid zones), and includes mostly herbaceous species, although a small number of trees (such as the giant Lobelia and the giant Senecio) and shrubs are also present. Asterales are organisms that seem to have evolved from one common ancestor.  Asterales share characteristics on morphological and biochemical levels. 

Asteroid<====>791<====>Asteroid  Asteroids are minor planets, especially those of the inner Solar System.  The larger ones have also been called planetoids.  These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not show the disc of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an active comet as minor planets in the outer Solar System were discovered and found to have volatile-based surfaces that resemble those of comets, they were often distinguished from asteroids of the asteroid belt.   In this article, the term "asteroid" refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System including those co-orbital with Jupiter. 

Allocution<====>794<====>Allocution   An allocution, or allocutus, is a formal statement made to the court by the defendant who has been found guilty prior to being sentenced.  It is part of the criminal procedure in some jurisdictions using common law. ConceptAn allocution allows the defendant to explain why the sentence should be lenient.  In plea bargains, an allocution may be required of the defendant.  The defendant explicitly admits specifically and in detail the actions and their reasons in exchange for a reduced sentence. In principle, that removes any doubt as to the exact nature of the defendant's guilt in the matter. 

Affidavit<====>795<====>Affidavit An affidavit (   ) is a written sworn statement of fact voluntarily made by an affiant or deponent under an oath or affirmation administered by a person authorized to do so by law.  Such statement is witnessed as to the authenticity of the affiant's signature by a taker of oaths, such as a notary public or commissioner of oaths.  The name is Medieval Latin for he/she has declared upon oath.  An affidavit is a type of verified statement or showing, or in other words, it contains a verification, meaning it is under oath or penalty of perjury, and this serves as evidence to its veracity and is required for court proceedings. 

Aries (constellation)<====>798<====>Aries (constellation) Aries  is one of the constellations of the zodiac.  It is located in the northern celestial hemisphere between Pisces to the west and Taurus to the east.  The name Aries is Latin for ram, and its symbol is  (Unicode ♈), representing a ram's horns.   It is one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations.   It is a mid-sized constellation, ranking 39th overall size, with an area of 441 square degrees (1. 1% of the celestial sphere). Although Aries came to represent specifically the ram whose fleece became the Golden Fleece of Ancient Greek mythology, it has represented a ram since late Babylonian times. 

Aquarius (constellation)<====>799<====>Aquarius (constellation)   Aquarius is a constellation of the zodiac, situated between Capricornus and Pisces.  Its name is Latin for "water-carrier" or "cup-carrier", and its symbol is  , a representation of water.  Aquarius is one of the oldest of the recognized constellations along the zodiac (the Sun's apparent path).   It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.  It is found in a region often called the Sea due to its profusion of constellations with watery associations such as Cetus the whale, Pisces the fish, and Eridanus the river. 

Anime<====>800<====>Anime Anime (   ),  also called Japanimation, is hand-drawn or computer animation associated with Japan.  The word anime is the Japanese term for animation, which means all forms of animated media.Outside Japan, anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters and fantastical themes. Arguably, the culturally abstract approach to the word's meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan. For simplicity, many Westerners strictly view anime as a Japanese animation product. 

Ankara<====>802<====>Ankara    Ankara ( English   ;   Turkish   ), formerly known as Ancyra ( ) and Angora, is the capital of the Republic of Turkey.  With a population of 4,587,558 in the urban center  (2014)  and 5,150,072 in its province  (2015) ,    it is Turkey's second largest city after former imperial capital Istanbul, having overtaken İzmir. Ankara was Atatürk's headquarters from 1920 and has been the capital of the Republic since the latter's founding in 1923, replacing Istanbul (once the Byzantine capital Constantinople) following the fall of the Ottoman Empire. 

Arabic<====>803<====>Arabic  Arabic ( ,or  or  ) is a Central Semitic language that first emerged in Iron Age northwestern Arabia and is now the lingua franca of the Arab world.   It is named after the Arabs, a term initially used to describe peoples living from Mesopotamia in the east to the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west, in northwestern Arabia, and in the Sinai peninsula. The modern written language (Modern Standard Arabic) is derived from Classical Arabic.  It is widely taught in schools and universities, and is used to varying degrees in workplaces, government, and the media. 

Alfred Hitchcock<====>808<====>Alfred Hitchcock    Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock   (13 August 1899 – 29 April 1980) was an English  film director and producer, widely regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers in the history of cinema.  He directed 53 feature films  in a career spanning six decades, becoming as well-known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews, his cameo roles in most of his films, and his hosting of Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955–1965). Born on the outskirts of London, Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a title card designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph-cable company. 

Anaconda<====>809<====>Anaconda    Anacondas are a group of large snakes of the genus Eunectes.  They are found in tropical South America.  Four species are currently recognized. DescriptionAlthough the name applies to a group of snakes, it is often used to refer only to one species in particular, the common or green anaconda (Eunectes murinus) which is the largest snake in the world by weight, and the second longest. EtymologyThe South American names anacauchoa and anacaona were suggested in an account by Peter Martyr d'Anghiera but the idea of a South American origin was questioned by Henry Walter Bates who, in his travels in South America, failed to find any similar name in use. 

Altaic languages<====>824<====>Altaic languages  Altaic ( ) is a proposed language family of central Eurasia and Siberia, now widely seen as discredited. The Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic groups are invariably included in the family; some authors added Korean and Japonic languages.   These languages are spoken in a wide arc stretching from eastern Europe, through Central Asia to Anatolia and to the Korean Peninsula and Japanese archipelago in East Asia.   The group is named after the Altai mountain range in Central Asia. This view was widespread prior to the 1960s but has almost no supporters among specialists today. 

Austrian German<====>825<====>Austrian German   Austrian German    ( ), Austrian Standard German,   Standard Austrian German  ( ) or Austrian High German   ( ), is the variety of Standard German written and spoken in Austria.  It has the highest sociolinguistic prestige locally, as it is the variation used in the media and for other formal situations. In less formal situations, Austrians tend to use forms closer to or identical with the Bavarian and Alemannic dialects, traditionally spoken – but rarely written – in Austria. HistoryAustrian German has its beginning in the mid-18th century, when empress Maria Theresa and her son Joseph II introduced compulsory schooling (in 1774) and several reforms of administration in their multilingual Habsburg empire. 

Axiom of choice<====>840<====>Axiom of choice  In mathematics, the axiom of choice, or AC, is an axiom of set theory equivalent to the statement that the Cartesian product of a collection of non-empty sets is non-empty.  Informally put, the axiom of choice says that given any collection of bins, each containing at least one object, it is possible to make a selection of exactly one object from each bin, even if the collection is infinite.  Formally, it states that for every indexed family  (S_i)_{i \in I}  of nonempty sets there exists an indexed family  (x_i)_{i \in I}  of elements such that  x_i \in S_i  for every  i \in I . 

Attila<====>841<====>Attila    Attila ( ; fl.  circa 406–453), frequently called Attila the Hun, was the ruler of the Huns from 434 until his death in March 453.  He was also the leader of a tribal empire consisting of Huns, Ostrogoths, and Alans among others, on the territory of Central and Eastern Europe. During his reign, he was one of the most feared enemies of the Western and Eastern Roman Empires.  He crossed the Danube twice and plundered the Balkans, but was unable to take Constantinople.  His unsuccessful campaign in Persia was followed in 441 by an invasion of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, the success of which emboldened Attila to invade the West. 

Aegean Sea<====>842<====>Aegean Sea   The Aegean Sea ( ;    ;)  is an elongated embayment of the Mediterranean Sea located between the Greek and Anatolian peninsulas, i. e. , between the mainlands of Greece and Turkey.  In the north, the Aegean is connected to the Marmara Sea and Black Sea by the Dardanelles and Bosphorus.  The Aegean Islands are within the sea and some bound it on its southern periphery, including Crete and Rhodes. The sea was traditionally known as the Archipelago (in Greek, Αρχιπέλαγος, meaning "chief sea"), but in English the meaning of Archipelago has changed to refer to the Aegean Islands and, generally, to any island group. 

A Clockwork Orange (novel)<====>843<====>A Clockwork Orange (novel) A Clockwork Orange is a dystopian novel by English writer Anthony Burgess, published in 1962.  Set in a near future English society featuring a subculture of extreme youth violence, the teenage protagonist, Alex, narrates his violent exploits and his experiences with state authorities intent on reforming him.   The book is partially written in a Russian-influenced argot called "Nadsat".  According to Burgess it was a   written in just three weeks.  In 2005, A Clockwork Orange was included on Time magazine's list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923,  and it was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. 

Amsterdam<====>844<====>Amsterdam    {{Infobox settlement  }}Amsterdam ( ;) is the capital and most populous municipality of the Netherlands.  Its status as the capital is mandated by the Constitution of the Netherlands,    although it is not the seat of the government, which is The Hague.   Amsterdam has a population of 851,373 within the city proper, 1,351,587 in the urban area,  and 2,410,960 in the Amsterdam metropolitan area.   The city is located in the province of North Holland in the west of the country but is not its capital, which is Haarlem. 

Museum of Work<====>846<====>Museum of Work  The Museum of Work, or Arbetets museum, is a museum located in Norrköping, Sweden. The museum can be found in the 20th century building The Iron in the Motala ström river in central Norrköping.See alsoList of museums in SwedenCulture of SwedenExternal linksMuseum of Work - Official site DEFAULTSORT

Audi<====>848<====>Audi   Audi AG ( ) is a German automobile manufacturer that designs, engineers, produces, markets and distributes luxury vehicles.  Audi is a member of the Volkswagen Group and has its roots at Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany.  Audi-branded vehicles are produced in nine production facilities worldwide. The origins of the company are complex, going back to the early 20th century and the initial enterprises (Horch and the Audiwerke) founded by engineer August Horch; and two other manufacturers (DKW and Wanderer), leading to the foundation of Auto Union in 1932.  The modern era of Audi essentially began in the 1960s when Auto Union was acquired by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz. 

Aircraft<====>849<====>Aircraft  An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air.   It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil,  or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines.   Common examples of aircraft include airplanes, helicopters, airships (including blimps), gliders, and hot air balloons. The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation.  Crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot, but unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers. 

Alfred Nobel<====>851<====>Alfred NobelAlfred Bernhard Nobel ( ;    ; 21 October 1833 – 10 December 1896) was a Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist. Known for inventing dynamite, Nobel also owned Bofors, which he had redirected from its previous role as primarily an iron and steel producer to a major manufacturer of cannon and other armaments.  Nobel held 355 different patents, dynamite being the most famous.  After reading a premature obituary which condemned him for profiting from the sales of arms, he bequeathed his fortune to institute the Nobel Prizes.   The synthetic element nobelium was named after him. 

Alexander Graham Bell<====>852<====>Alexander Graham BellAlexander Graham Bell (March 3, 1847 – August 2, 1922)  was a   Scottish-born  scientist, inventor, engineer, and innovator who is credited with patenting the first practical telephone    and founding the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) in 1885.   Bell's father, grandfather, and brother had all been associated with work on elocution and speech and both his mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing Bell's life's work.   His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices which eventually culminated in Bell being awarded the first U. 

Anatolia<====>854<====>Anatolia   Anatolia ( , in Modern Greek:  , Anatolía, from  ,  ,  modern pronunciation    – "east" or "(sun)rise"), also known as Asia Minor ( , in Medieval and Modern Greek:  ,  ,  modern pronunciation    – "small Asia"), Asian Turkey, the Anatolian peninsula, or the Anatolian plateau, is the westernmost protrusion of Asia, which makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey.  The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west.

Aberdeenshire<====>857<====>Aberdeenshire    Aberdeenshire ( ) is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland. It takes its name from the old County of Aberdeen which had substantially different boundaries.  Modern Aberdeenshire includes all of what was once Kincardineshire, as well as part of Banffshire.  The old boundaries are still officially used for a few purposes, namely land registration and lieutenancy.  Aberdeenshire Council is headquartered at Woodhill House, in Aberdeen, making it the only Scottish council whose headquarters are located outside its jurisdiction.  Aberdeen itself forms a different council area (Aberdeen City).  Aberdeenshire borders onto Angus and Perth and Kinross to the south, Highland and Moray to the west and Aberdeen City to the east. 

American Civil War<====>863<====>American Civil War The American Civil War was fought in the United States from 1861 to 1865.  The result of a long-standing controversy over slavery, war broke out in April 1861, when Confederates attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina, shortly after President Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated.  The nationalists of the Union proclaimed loyalty to the U. S.  Constitution.  They faced secessionists of the Confederate States, who advocated for states' rights to expand slavery. Among the 34 U. S.  states in February 1861, seven Southern slave states individually declared their secession from the U. 

Andy Warhol<====>864<====>Andy WarholAndy Warhol ( ;  born Andrew Warhola; August 6, 1928 – February 22, 1987) was an American artist, director and producer who was a leading figure in the visual art movement known as pop art.  His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, celebrity culture, and advertising that flourished by the 1960s, and span a variety of media, including painting, silkscreening, photography, film, and sculpture.  Some of his best known works include the silkscreen paintings Campbell's Soup Cans (1962) and Marilyn Diptych (1962), the experimental film Chelsea Girls (1966), and the multimedia events known as the Exploding Plastic Inevitable (1966–67). 

Alp Arslan<====>868<====>Alp Arslan  Alp Arslan (honorific in Turkish meaning "Heroic Lion"; in  ; full name: Diya ad-Dunya wa ad-Din Adud ad-Dawlah Abu Shuja Muhammad Alp Arslan ibn Dawud  ;  20 January 1029 – 15 December 1072), real name Muhammad bin Dawud Chaghri, was the second Sultan of the Seljuk Empire and great-grandson of Seljuk, the eponymous founder of the dynasty.  As Sultan, Alp Arslan greatly expanded Seljuk territory and consolidated power, defeating rivals to his south and northwest.  His victory over the Byzantines at Manzikert ushered in the Turkish settlement of Anatolia.  For his military prowess and fighting skills he obtained the name Alp Arslan, which means "Heroic Lion"  in Turkish. 

American Film Institute<====>869<====>American Film Institute  The American Film Institute (AFI) is an American film organization that educates filmmakers and honors the heritage of the motion picture arts in the United States.  AFI is supported by private funding and public membership. MembershipThe institute is composed of leaders from the film, entertainment, business and academic communities.  A board of trustees chaired by Sir Howard Stringer and a board of directors chaired by Robert A.  Daly guide the organization, which is led by President and CEO, film historian Bob Gazzale (as of October 2014).  Prior leaders were founding director George Stevens, Jr. 

Akira Kurosawa<====>872<====>Akira Kurosawa was a Japanese film director and screenwriter.  Regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema, he directed 30 films in a career spanning 57 years. Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter.  After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director during World War II with the popular action film Sanshiro Sugata (a. k. a.  Judo Saga).  After the war, the critically acclaimed Drunken Angel (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. 

Ancient Egypt<====>874<====>Ancient Egypt   Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in the place that is now the country Egypt.  It is one of six historic civilizations to arise independently.  Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology)  with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes (often identified with Narmer).   The history of ancient Egypt occurred as a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. 

Analog Brothers<====>875<====>Analog Brothers   Analog Brothers were an experimental hip hop band featuring Tracy 'Ice Oscillator' Marrow (Body Count's Ice-T) on keyboards, drums and vocals, Keith 'Keith Korg' Thornton (Ultramagnetic MCs' Kool Keith) on bass, strings and vocals, Marc 'Mark Moog' Giveand (Raw Breed's Marc Live) on drums, violins and vocals, Christopher 'Silver Synth' Rodgers (Black Silver) on synthesizer, lazar bell and vocals, and Rex Colonel 'Rex Roland JX3P' Doby Jr.  (Pimpin' Rex) on keyboards, vocals and production.  Its album Pimp to Eat featured guest appearances by various members of Rhyme Syndicate, Odd Oberheim, Jacky Jasper (who appears as Jacky Jasper on the song "We Sleep Days" and H-Bomb on "War"), D. 

Motor neuron disease<====>876<====>Motor neuron disease   A motor neuron disease (MND) is any of several neurological disorders that selectively affect motor neurons, the cells that control voluntary muscles of the body.  They include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), progressive bulbar palsy (PBP) and pseudobulbar palsy.  Spinal muscular atrophies (SMA) are sometimes included in the group by some neurologists but it is different disease with clear genetic cause. They are neurodegenerative in nature and cause increasing disability and eventually, death.  TerminologyIn the United States, the term is often used to denote ALS, the most common disorder in the group. 

Abjad<====>877<====>Abjad    An abjad (pronounced    or  )  is a type of writing system where each symbol or glyph stands for a consonant, leaving the reader to supply the appropriate vowel.  The name abjad is based on the old Arabic alphabet's first four letters – a, b, j, d – to replace the common terms "consonantary", "consonantal alphabet" or "syllabary" to refer to the family of scripts called West Semitic. EtymologyThe name "abjad" (   ) is derived from pronouncing the first letters of the Arabic alphabet in order.  The ordering ( ) of Arabic letters used to match that of the older Hebrew, Phoenician and Semitic alphabets;  . 

Abugida<====>878<====>AbugidaAn abugida   (from Ge'ez: አቡጊዳ ’abugida), or alphasyllabary, is a segmental writing system in which consonant–vowel sequences are written as a unit: each unit is based on a consonant letter, and vowel notation is secondary.  This contrasts with a full alphabet, in which vowels have status equal to consonants, and with an abjad, in which vowel marking is absent, partial, or optional.  (In less formal contexts, all three types of script may be termed alphabets. ) The terms also contrast them with a syllabary, in which the symbols cannot be split into separate consonants and vowels. 

ABBA<====>880<====>ABBA    ABBA ( )  were a Swedish pop group, formed in Stockholm in 1972 by Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, and Anni-Frid Lyngstad: the group name derives from the first letter in each of their names.  They became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of popular music, topping the charts worldwide from 1974 to 1982.  ABBA won the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 at The Dome in Brighton, UK, giving Sweden its first triumph in the contest.  They are the most successful group to have taken part in the competition. 

Allegiance<====>881<====>Allegiance   An allegiance is a duty of fidelity said to be owed, or freely committed, by the people, subjects or citizens to their state or sovereign.  EtymologyFrom Middle English ligeaunce (see medieval Latin ligeantia, "a  liegance").  The al- prefix was probably added through confusion with another legal term, allegeance, an "allegation" (the French allegeance comes from the English).  Allegiance is formed from "liege," from Old French liege, "liege, free", of Germanic origin.  The connection with Latin ligare, "to bind," is erroneous.    UsageTraditionally, English legal commentators used the term allegiance in two ways. 

MessagePad<====>887<====>MessagePad  The MessagePad is the first series of personal digital assistant devices developed by Apple Computer for the Newton platform in 1993.    Some electronic engineering and the manufacture of Apple's MessagePad devices was undertaken in Japan by the Sharp Corporation.  The devices were based on the ARM 610 RISC processor and all featured handwriting recognition software and were developed and marketed by Apple.   The devices ran the Newton OS. DetailsScreen and inputWith the MessagePad 120 with Newton OS 2. 0, the Newton Keyboard by Apple became available, which can also be used via the dongle on Newton devices with a Newton InterConnect port, most notably the Apple MessagePad 2000/2100 series, as well as the Apple eMate 300. 

A. E. van Vogt<====>888<====>A.  E.  van Vogt  Alfred Elton van Vogt  ( ; April 26, 1912 – January 26, 2000) was a Canadian-born science fiction author.   He is regarded as one of the most popular, influential and complex practitioners of the mid-twentieth century, the genre's so-called Golden Age.  Early life and writingsVan Vogt was born on a farm in Edenburg (a Russian Mennonite community east of Gretna, Manitoba, Canada).  Until age four, van Vogt and his family spoke only a dialect of Low German at home.  Panshin, Alexei "Man Beyond Man.  The Early Stories of A. 

Anna Kournikova<====>890<====>Anna KournikovaAnna Sergeyevna Kournikova ( ; born 7 June 1981) is a former professional tennis player from Russia.  Her appearance  and celebrity status made her one of the best known tennis stars worldwide.  At the peak of her fame, fans looking for images of Kournikova made her name one of the most common search strings on Google Search.Despite never winning a singles title, she reached No.  8 in the world in 2000.  She achieved greater success playing doubles, where she was at times the world No. 

Alfons Maria Jakob<====>892<====>Alfons Maria Jakob  Alfons Maria Jakob (2 July 1884 in Aschaffenburg/Bavaria – 17 October 1931 in Hamburg) was a German neurologist who worked in the field of neuropathology. He was born in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria and educated in medicine at the universities of Munich, Berlin, and Strasbourg, where he received his doctorate in 1908.  During the following year, he began clinical work under the psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin and did laboratory work with Franz Nissl and Alois Alzheimer in Munich.  Alfons Maria Jakob at Who Named It In 1911, by way of an invitation from Wilhelm Weygandt, Neurological Eponyms edited by Peter J. 

Agnosticism<====>894<====>Agnosticism Agnosticism is the view that the existence of God, of the divine or the supernatural is unknown or  unknowable.(page 56 in 1967 edition)   According to the philosopher William L.  Rowe, "agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist".   Agnosticism is a doctrine or set of  s  rather than a religion. English biologist Thomas Henry Huxley coined the word "agnostic" in 1869. 

Argon<====>896<====>Argon    Argon is a chemical element with symbol Ar and atomic number 18.  It is in group 18 of the periodic table and is a noble gas.   Argon is the third-most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere, at 0. 934% (9340 ppmv).  It is more than twice as abundant as water vapor (which averages about 4000 ppmv, but varies greatly), 23 times as abundant as carbon dioxide (400 ppmv), and more than 500 times as abundant as neon (18 ppmv).  Argon is the most abundant noble gas in Earth's crust, comprising 0. 00015% of the crust. 

Arsenic<====>897<====>Arsenic   Arsenic is a chemical element with symbol As and atomic number 33.  Arsenic occurs in many minerals, usually in combination with sulfur and metals, but also as a pure elemental crystal.  Arsenic is a metalloid.  It has various allotropes, but only the gray form is important to industry. The primary use of metallic arsenic is in alloys of lead (for example, in car batteries and ammunition).  Arsenic is a common n-type dopant in semiconductor electronic devices, and the optoelectronic compound gallium arsenide is the second most commonly used semiconductor after doped silicon.  Arsenic and its compounds, especially the trioxide, are used in the production of pesticides, treated wood products, herbicides, and insecticides. 

Antimony<====>898<====>Antimony    Antimony is a chemical element with symbol Sb (from  ) and atomic number 51.  A lustrous gray metalloid, it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite (Sb 2 S 3 ).  Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were powdered for use as medicine and cosmetics, often known by the Arabic name, kohl.   Metallic antimony was also known, but it was erroneously identified as lead upon its discovery.  In the West, it was first isolated by Vannoccio Biringuccio and described in 1540. For some time, China has been the largest producer of antimony and its compounds, with most production coming from the Xikuangshan Mine in Hunan. 

Actinium<====>899<====>Actinium   Actinium is a chemical element with symbol Ac and atomic number 89.   Actinium gave the name to the actinide series, a group of 15 similar elements between actinium and lawrencium in the periodic table.  It is also sometimes considered the first of the 7th-period transition metals, although lawrencium is less commonly given that position.  Discovered in 1899, it was the first non-primordial radioactive element to be isolated.  Polonium, radium and radon were observed before actinium, but they were not isolated until 1902. A soft, silvery-white radioactive metal, actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation. 

Americium<====>900<====>Americium   Americium is a synthetic chemical element with symbol Am and atomic number 95.  It is a transuranic member of the actinide series, in the periodic table located under the lanthanide element europium, and thus by analogy was named after the Americas.  Americium was first produced in 1944 by the group of Glenn T.  Seaborg from Berkeley, California, at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago, a part of the Manhattan Project.  Although it is the third element in the transuranic series, it was discovered fourth, after the heavier curium.  The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. 

Astatine<====>901<====>Astatine  Astatine is a radioactive chemical element with symbol At and atomic number 85.  It is the rarest naturally occurring element in the Earth's crust, occurring only as the decay product of various heavier elements.  All of astatine's isotopes are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a half-life of 8. 1 hours.  A sample of the pure element has never been assembled, because any macroscopic specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity. The bulk properties of astatine are not known with any certainty.  Many of them have been estimated based on the element's position on the periodic table as a heavier analog of iodine, and a member of the halogens (the group of elements including fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). 

Atom<====>902<====>Atom    An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element.  Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms.  Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale). Atoms are small enough that attempting to predict their behavior using classical physics – as if they were billiard balls, for example – gives noticeably incorrect predictions due to quantum effects.  Through the development of physics, atomic models have incorporated quantum principles to better explain and predict the behavior. 

Arable land<====>903<====>Arable land Arable land (from Latin  , "able to be plowed") is, according to one definition,  land capable of being ploughed and used to grow crops.  Oxford English Dictionary,   "arable, adj.  and n. " Oxford University Press (Oxford), 2013.   In Britain, it was traditionally contrasted with pasturable land such as heaths which could be used for sheep-rearing but not farmland. A quite different kind of definition is used by various agencies concerned with agriculture.   In providing statistics on arable land, the FAO and the World Bank   use the definition offered in the glossary accompanying FAOSTAT:  "Arable land is the land under temporary agricultural crops (multiple-cropped areas are counted only once), temporary meadows for mowing or pasture, land under market and kitchen gardens and land temporarily fallow (less than five years). 

Aluminium<====>904<====>AluminiumAluminium or aluminum is a chemical element with symbol Al and atomic number 13.  It is a silvery-white, soft, nonmagnetic, ductile metal in the boron group.  By mass, aluminium makes up about 8% of the  Earth's crust; it is the third most abundant element after oxygen and silicon and the most abundant metal in the crust, though it is less common in the mantle below.  The chief ore of aluminium is bauxite.  Aluminium metal is so chemically reactive that native specimens are rare and limited to extreme reducing environments.  Instead, it is found combined in over 270 different minerals. 

Advanced Chemistry<====>905<====>Advanced Chemistry  Advanced Chemistry is a German hip hop group from Heidelberg, a scenic city in Baden-Württemberg, South Germany.  Advanced Chemistry was founded in 1987 by Toni L, Linguist, Gee-One, DJ Mike MD (Mike Dippon) and MC Torch.  Each member of the group holds German citizenship, and Toni L, Linguist, and Torch are of Italian, Ghanaian, and Haitian backgrounds, respectively.  Pennay, Mark "Rap in Germinay" in Mitchell, Tony ed.  Global Noise.  Middletown: Wesleyan University Press, 2001.  Influenced by North American socially conscious rap and the Native tongues movement, Advanced Chemistry is regarded as one of the main pioneers in German hip hop. 

Anglican Communion<====>909<====>Anglican CommunionThe Anglican Communion is the fourth largest Christian communion with 85 million members,   founded in 1867 in London, England.  It consists of the Church of England and national and regional Anglican episcopal polities in full communion with it,  with traditional origins of their doctrines summarised in the Thirty-nine Articles (1571).  Archbishop Justin Welby of Canterbury acts as a focus of unity, recognised as primus inter pares ("first among equals"), but does not exercise authority in the provinces outside England. The Anglican Communion was founded at the Lambeth Conference in 1867 in London, England, under the leadership of Charles Longley, Archbishop of Canterbury.

Kaijser is a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences since 2007 and also a member of the editorial board of two scientific journals: Journal of Urban Technology and Centaurus. 

Archipelago<====>911<====>Archipelago   An archipelago (   ), sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands, or sometimes a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. The word archipelago is derived from the Greek ἄρχι- – arkhi- ("chief") and πέλαγος – pélagos ("sea") through the Italian arcipelago.  In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek  and Latin archipelagus) was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). 

Author<====>914<====>Author   An author is the originator of any written work such as a book or play, and is thus also a writer.  More broadly defined, an author is "the person who originated or gave existence to anything" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created.  Legal significance of authorshipTypically, the first owner of a copyright is the person who created the work i. e.  the author.  But, what if more than one person created the work? Then, a case of joint authorship can be made provided some criteria are met.  In the copyright laws of various jurisdictions, there is a necessity for little flexibility regarding what constitutes authorship. 

Andrey Markov<====>915<====>Andrey Markov   Andrey (Andrei) Andreyevich Markov ( , in older works also spelled Markoff ) (14 June 1856 N. S.  – 20 July 1922) was a Russian mathematician.He is best known for his work on stochastic processes.   A primary subject of his research later became known as Markov chains and Markov processes.  Markov and his younger brother Vladimir Andreevich Markov (1871–1897) proved Markov brothers' inequality. His son, another Andrei Andreevich Markov (1903–1979), was also a notable mathematician, making contributions to constructive mathematics and recursive function theory. BiographyAndrey Markov was born on 14 June 1856 in Russia. 

Angst<====>921<====>Angst    Angst means fear or anxiety (anguish is its Latinate equivalent, and anxious, anxiety are of similar origin).  The word angst was introduced into English from the Danish, Norwegian and Dutch word angst and the German word Angst.  It is attested since the 19th century in English translations of the works of Kierkegaard and Freud.It is used in English to describe an intense feeling of apprehension, anxiety, or inner turmoil. In German, the technical terminology of psychology and philosophy distinguishes between Angst and Furcht in that  Furcht is a negative anticipation regarding a concrete threat, while Angst is a non-directional and unmotivated emotion. 

Anxiety<====>922<====>Anxiety    Anxiety is an emotion characterized by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behavior, such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination. It is the subjectively unpleasant feelings of dread over anticipated events, such as the feeling of imminent death.   Anxiety is not the same as fear, which is a response to a  real or perceived immediate threat,    whereas anxiety is the expectation of future threat.   Anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness and worry, usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a situation that is only subjectively seen as menacing. 

A. A. Milne<====>924<====>A.  A.  Milne Alan Alexander Milne ( ; 18 January 1882 – 31 January 1956) was an English author, best known for his books about the teddy bear Winnie-the-Pooh and for various poems.  Milne was a noted writer, primarily as a playwright, before the huge success of Pooh overshadowed all his previous work.  Milne served in both World Wars, joining the British Army in World War I, and was a captain of the British Home Guard in World War II. BiographyAlan Alexander Milne was born in Kilburn, London  to parents John Vine Milne, who was born in Jamaica,   and Sarah Marie Milne (née Heginbotham) and grew up at Henley House School, 6/7 Mortimer Road (now Crescent), Kilburn, a small public school run by his father. 

Asociación Alumni<====>925<====>Asociación Alumni   Asociación Alumni, usually just Alumni, is an Argentine rugby union club located in Tortuguitas, Greater Buenos Aires.  The senior squad currently competes at Top 12, the first division of the Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires league system. The club has ties with former football club Alumni because both were established by Buenos Aires English High School students. HistoryBackground The first club with the name "Alumni" played association football, having been found in 1898 by students of Buenos Aires English High School (BAEHS) along with director Alexander Watson Hutton.  Originally under the name "English High School A. 

Axiom<====>928<====>Axiom    An axiom or postulate is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments.  The word comes from the Greek axíōma ( ) 'that which is thought worthy or fit' or 'that which commends itself as evident. '  The term has subtle differences in definition when used in the context of different fields of study.  As defined in classic philosophy, an axiom is a statement that is so evident or well-established, that it is accepted without controversy or question.    As used in modern logic, an axiom is simply a premise or starting point for reasoning. 

Alpha<====>929<====>Alpha    Alpha (uppercase  , lowercase  ;  , álpha,  modern pronunciation  álfa) is the first letter of the Greek alphabet.  In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 1.  It was derived from the Phoenician and Hebrew letter aleph  - an ox or leader.  Letters that arose from alpha include the Latin A and the Cyrillic letter А. In English, the noun "alpha" is used as a synonym for "beginning", or "first" (in a series), reflecting its Greek roots.  UsesGreekIn Ancient Greek, alpha was pronounced   and could be either phonemically long ([a:]) or short ([a]). 

Alvin Toffler<====>930<====>Alvin Toffler  Alvin Toffler (October 4, 1928 – June 27, 2016) was an American writer, futurist, and businessman known for his works discussing modern technologies, including the digital revolution and the communication revolution, with emphasis on their effects on cultures worldwide. Toffler was an associate editor of Fortune magazine.  In his early works he focused on technology and its impact, which he termed "information overload. " In 1970 his first major book about the future, Future Shock, became a worldwide best-seller and has sold over 6 million copies. He and his wife Heidi Toffler, who collaborated with him for most of his writings, moved on to examining the reaction to changes in society with another best-selling book, The Third Wave in 1980. 

The Amazing Spider-Man<====>931<====>The Amazing Spider-Man   The Amazing Spider-Man is an American comic book series published by Marvel Comics, featuring the adventures of the fictional superhero Spider-Man.  Being the mainstream continuity of the franchise, it began publication in 1963 as a monthly periodical and was published continuously, with a brief interruption in 1995, until its relaunch with a new numbering order in 1999.  In 2003 the series reverted to the numbering order of the first volume.  The title has occasionally been published biweekly, and was published three times a month from 2008 to 2010.  A film named after the comic was released July 3, 2012. 

Antigua and Barbuda<====>951<====>Antigua and Barbuda  Antigua and Barbuda ( ;  ) is a sovereign state in the Americas, lying between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.  It consists of two major islands, Antigua and Barbuda, and a number of smaller islands (including Great Bird, Green, Guiana, Long, Maiden and York Islands and further south, the island of Redonda).  The permanent population numbers about 81,800 (at the 2011 Census) and the capital and largest port and city is St.  John's, on Antigua. Lying near each other (the main Barbuda airport is less than 0. 

Azincourt<====>953<====>Azincourt   Azincourt ( ; historically, Agincourt   in English) is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in northern France. It is named after the Battle of Agincourt of 1415 which took place there. GeographySituated   north-west of Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise on the D71 road between Hesdin and FrugesEtymologyThe toponym is attested as Aisincurt in 1175, derived from a Germanic masculine name Aizo, Aizino and the early Northern French word curt 'farm with a courtyard' (Late Latin cortem).  It has no etymological connection in French with Agincourt, Meurthe-et-Moselle (attested as Egincourt 875), which is derived from another Germanic male name *Ingin-. 

Albert Speer<====>954<====>Albert Speer    Berthold Konrad Hermann Albert Speer  ( ;  ; March 19, 1905 – September 1, 1981) was a German architect who was, for most of World War II, Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production for Nazi Germany.  Speer was Adolf Hitler's chief architect before assuming ministerial office.  As "the Nazi who said sorry",  he accepted moral responsibility at the Nuremberg trials and in his memoirs for complicity in crimes of the Nazi regime, while insisting he had been ignorant of the Holocaust. Speer joined the Nazi Party in 1931, launching himself on a political and governmental career which lasted fourteen years. 

Asteraceae<====>956<====>Asteraceae  Asteraceae or Compositae (commonly referred to as the aster, daisy, composite, Great Basin Wildflowers, Laird R.  Blackwell, 2006, p.  275  or sunflower family) is a very large and widespread family of flowering plants (Angiospermae).The family currently has 32,913 accepted species names, in 1,911 genera (list) and 13 subfamilies.In terms of numbers of species, the Asteraceae are rivaled only by the Orchidaceae.   Panero, J. L. , Crozier, B. S.  Tree of Life – Asteraceae  (Which of the two families is actually larger is unclear, owing to uncertainty about exactly how many species exist in each family. 

Apiaceae<====>957<====>Apiaceae   Apiaceae or Umbelliferae, is a family of mostly aromatic flowering plants named after the type genus Apium and commonly known as the celery, carrot or parsley family.  It is the 16th-largest family of flowering plants, with more than 3,700 species in 434 genera Stevens, P. F.  (2001 onwards).  Angiosperm Phylogeny Website.  Version 9, June 2008.   including such well-known and economically important plants such as ajwain, angelica, anise, asafoetida, caraway, carrot, celery, chervil,  coriander, cumin, dill, fennel, hemlock, lovage, cow parsley, parsley, parsnip, sea holly, and silphium (a plant whose identity is unclear and which may be extinct). 

Axon<====>958<====>Axon   An axon (from Greek ἄξων áxōn, axis) or nerve fiber, is a long, slender projection of a nerve cell, or neuron, that typically conducts electrical impulses known as action potentials, away from the nerve cell body.  The function of the axon is to transmit information to different neurons, muscles, and glands.  In certain sensory neurons (pseudounipolar neurons), such as those for touch and warmth, the axons are called afferent nerve fibers and the electrical impulse travels along these from the periphery to the cell body, and from the cell body to the spinal cord along another branch of the same axon. 

Aramaic alphabet<====>960<====>Aramaic alphabet    The ancient Aramaic alphabet is adapted from the Phoenician alphabet and became distinctive from it by the 8th century BCE.  It was used to write the Aramaic language and had displaced the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet, itself a derivative of the Phoenician alphabet, for the writing of Hebrew.  The letters all represent consonants, some of which are also used as matres lectionis to indicate long vowels. The Aramaic alphabet is historically significant since virtually all modern Middle Eastern writing systems can be traced back to it as well as numerous non-Chinese writing systems of Central and East Asia. 

American shot<====>966<====>American shot   "American shot" is a translation of a phrase from French film criticism, "plan américain" and refers to a medium-long ("knee") film shot of a group of characters, who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera.  The usual arrangement is for the actors to stand in an irregular line from one side of the screen to the other, with the actors at the end coming forward a little and standing more in profile than the others.  The purpose of the composition is to allow complex dialogue scenes to be played out without changes in camera position. 

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis<====>967<====>Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis  Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), or acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, is a rare autoimmune disease marked by a sudden, widespread attack of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord.  As well as causing the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed, ADEM also attacks the nerves of the central nervous system and damages their myelin insulation, which, as a result, destroys the white matter.  It is often triggered after the patient has received a viral infection or, perhaps exceedingly rarely specific non-routine vaccinations.    ADEM's symptoms resemble the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS), so the disease itself is sorted into the classification of the multiple sclerosis borderline diseases. 

Ataxia<====>969<====>Ataxia   Ataxia is a neurological sign consisting of lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements that includes gait abnormality.  Ataxia is a non-specific clinical manifestation implying dysfunction of the parts of the nervous system that coordinate movement, such as the cerebellum.  Ataxia can be limited to one side of the body, which is referred to as hemiataxia.  Several possible causes exist for these patterns of neurological dysfunction.  Dystaxia is a mild degree of ataxia.  Friedreich's ataxia has gait abnormality as the most commonly presented symptom.   The word is from Greek α- [a negative prefix] + -τάξις [order] = "lack of order". 

Abdul Alhazred<====>972<====>Abdul Alhazred  Abdul Alhazred is a fictional character created by American horror writer H.  P.  Lovecraft.  He is the so-called "Mad Arab" credited with authoring the fictional book Kitab al-Azif (the Necronomicon), and as such is an integral part of Cthulhu Mythos lore. Name   Abdul Alhazred was a pseudonym adopted by Lovecraft after reading 1001 Arabian Nights in his early childhood.  The name may have been invented by Lovecraft himself or the Phillips' family lawyer Albert Baker.  Abdul is a common Arabic name component [meaning servant of the powerful] but never a name by itself. 

Ada Lovelace<====>974<====>Ada Lovelace   Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.  She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine.  As a result, she is often regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and the first computer programmer. Ada Lovelace was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron, and his wife Anne Isabella Milbanke ("Annabella"), Lady Wentworth. 

August Derleth<====>980<====>August Derleth  August William Derleth (February 24, 1909 – July 4, 1971) was an American writer and anthologist.  Though best remembered as the first book publisher of the writings of H.  P.  Lovecraft, and for his own contributions to the Cthulhu Mythos genre of horror, as well as his founding of the publisher Arkham House (which did much to bring supernatural fiction into print in hardcover in the US that had only been readily available in the UK), Derleth was a leading American regional writer of his day, as well as prolific in several other genres, including  historical fiction, poetry, detective fiction, science fiction, and biography. 

Alps<====>981<====>Alps    The Alps ( ;;    ;    ;  ;    ) are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe,  The Caucasus Mountains are higher, and the Urals longer, but both lie partly in Asia.   stretching approximately   across eight Alpine countries (from west to east): France, Switzerland, Italy, Monaco, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany, and Slovenia.   The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. 

Albert Camus<====>983<====>Albert Camus  Albert Camus ( ;   ; 7 November 1913 – 4 January 1960) was a French philosopher, author, and journalist.  His views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as absurdism.  He wrote in his essay The Rebel that his whole life was devoted to opposing the philosophy of nihilism while still delving deeply into individual freedom.  He won the Nobel Prize in Literature at the age of 43 in 1957, the second youngest recipient in history.  Camus did not consider himself to be an existentialist despite usually being classified as a follower of it, even in his lifetime. 

Agatha Christie<====>984<====>Agatha Christie    Dame Agatha ( ) Mary Clarissa Christie, Lady Mallowan, DBE (née Miller; 15 September 1890 – 12 January 1976) was an English writer.  She is known for her 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections, particularly those revolving around her fictional detectives Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple.  Christie also wrote the world's longest-running play, a murder mystery, The Mousetrap,    and six romances under the name Mary Westmacott.  In 1971 she was elevated to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her contribution to literature.  Christie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Torquay, Devon. 

The Plague<====>986<====>The Plague   The Plague (French: La Peste) is a novel by Albert Camus, published in 1947, that tells the story of a plague sweeping the French Algerian city of Oran.  It asks a number of questions relating to the nature of destiny and the human condition.  The characters in the book, ranging from doctors to vacationers to fugitives, all help to show the effects the plague has on a populace. The novel is believed to be based on the cholera epidemic that killed a large percentage of Oran's population in 1849 following French colonization, but the novel is placed in the 1940s. 

Applied ethics<====>988<====>Applied ethics  Applied ethics is the branch of ethics concerned with the analysis of particular moral issues in private and public life.   For example, the bioethics community is concerned with identifying the correct approach to moral issues in the life sciences, such as euthanasia, the allocation of scarce health resources, or the use of human embryos in research.Environmental ethics is concerned with ecological issues such as the responsibility of government and corporations to clean up pollution.   Business ethics includes questions regarding the duties or duty of 'whistleblowers' to the general public or to their loyalty to their employers. 

Absolute value<====>991<====>Absolute value  In mathematics, the absolute value or modulus   of a real number   is the non-negative value of   without regard to its sign.  Namely,   for a positive  ,   for a negative   (in which case   is positive), and  .  For example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of −3 is also 3.  The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its distance from zero. Generalisations of the absolute value for real numbers occur in a wide variety of mathematical settings. 

Analog signal<====>993<====>Analog signal   An analog signal  is any continuous signal for which the time varying feature (variable) of the signal is a representation of some other time varying quantity, i. e. , analogous to another time varying signal.    For example, in an analog audio signal, the instantaneous voltage of the signal varies continuously with the pressure of the sound waves.  It differs from a digital signal, in which the continuous quantity is a representation of a sequence of discrete values which can only take on one of a finite number of values.The term analog signal usually refers to electrical signals; however, mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, human speech, and other systems may also convey or be considered analog signals. 

Arecales<====>994<====>Arecales Arecales is an order of flowering plants.  The order has been widely recognised only for the past few decades; until then, the accepted name for the order including these plants was Principes. TaxonomyThe Cronquist system of 1981 assigned the order to the subclass Arecidae in the class Liliopsida (= monocotyledons). The Thorne system (1992) and the Dahlgren system assigned the order to the superorder Areciflorae, also called Arecanae in the subclass Liliidae (= monocotyledons), with the single family Arecaceae. The APG II system of 2003 recognised the order and placed it in the clade commelinids in the monocots and uses this circumscription:order Arecalesfamily Arecaceae, alternative name PalmaeThis was unchanged from the APG system of 1998, although it used the spelling "commelinoids" instead of commelinids. 

Hercule Poirot<====>1000<====>Hercule Poirot    Hercule Poirot ( ,  ;   ) is a fictional Belgian detective, created by Agatha Christie.  Poirot is one of Christie's most famous and long-lived characters, appearing in 33 novels, one play (Black Coffee), and more than 50 short stories published between 1920 and 1975. Poirot has been portrayed on radio, in film and on television by various actors, including Austin Trevor, John Moffatt, Albert Finney, Sir Peter Ustinov, Sir Ian Holm, Tony Randall, Alfred Molina, Orson Welles, David Suchet and Sir Kenneth Branagh.  OverviewInfluencesPoirot's name was derived from two other fictional detectives of the time: Marie Belloc Lowndes' Hercule Popeau and Frank Howel Evans' Monsieur Poiret, a retired Belgian police officer living in London.

Miss Marple is an elderly spinster who lives in the village of St.  Mary Mead and acts as an amateur consulting detective.  Alongside Hercule Poirot, she is one of the most loved and famous of Christie's characters and has been portrayed numerous times on screen.  Her first appearance was in a short story published in The Royal Magazine in December 1927, "The Tuesday Night Club",  which later became the first chapter of The Thirteen Problems (1932). 

April<====>1004<====>April April is the fourth month of the year in the Gregorian calendar, the fifth in the early Julian and the first month to have the length of 30 days. April is commonly associated with the season of spring in parts of the Northern Hemisphere and autumn in parts of the Southern Hemisphere, where it is the seasonal equivalent to October in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa. HistoryThe Romans gave this month the Latin name Aprilis "April" in Chambers's Encyclopædia.  London: George Newnes, 1961, Vol.  1, p.  497.   but the derivation of this name is uncertain. 

August<====>1005<====>August August is the eighth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars, falling between July and September, and the fifth month to have the length of 31 days.   It was originally named Sextilis in Latin because it was the sixth month in the original ten-month Roman calendar under Romulus in 753 BC, and March was the first month of the year.  About 700 BC, it became the eighth month when January and February were added to the year before March by King Numa Pompilius, who also gave it 29 days.

Alcohol<====>1014<====>Alcohol    In chemistry, an alcohol is any organic compound in which the hydroxyl functional group (–OH) is bound to a saturated carbon atom.   The term alcohol originally referred to the primary alcohol ethanol (ethyl alcohol), which is used as a drug and is the main alcohol present in alcoholic beverages. The suffix -ol appears in the IUPAC chemical name of all substances where the hydroxyl group is the functional group with the highest priority; in substances where a higher priority group is present the prefix hydroxy- will appear in the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name. 

Achill Island<====>1016<====>Achill Island   Achill Island ( ;  ) in County Mayo is the largest island off the coast of Ireland, and is situated off the west coast.  It has a population of 2,700.  Its area is  .  Achill is attached to the mainland by Michael Davitt Bridge, between the villages of Gob an Choire (Achill Sound) and Poll Raithní (Polranny).  A bridge was first completed here in 1887, replaced by another structure in 1949, and subsequently replaced with the current bridge which was completed in 2008.

Allen Ginsberg<====>1017<====>Allen Ginsberg  Irwin Allen Ginsberg ( ; June 3, 1926 – April 5, 1997) was an American poet, philosopher, and writer.   He is considered to be one of the leading figures of both the Beat Generation during the 1950s and the counterculture that soon followed.  He vigorously opposed militarism, economic materialism and sexual repression and was known as embodying various aspects of this counterculture, such as his views on drugs, hostility to bureaucracy and openness to Eastern religions.He was one of many influential American writers of his time known as the Beat Generation, which included famous writers such as Jack Kerouac and William S. 

Algebraically closed field<====>1018<====>Algebraically closed field In abstract algebra, an algebraically closed field F contains a root for every non-constant polynomial in F[x], the ring of polynomials in the variable x with coefficients in F. ExamplesAs an example, the field of real numbers is not algebraically closed, because the polynomial equation x 2  + 1 = 0  has no solution in real numbers, even though all its coefficients (1 and 0) are real.   The same argument proves that no subfield of the real field is algebraically closed; in particular, the field of rational numbers is not algebraically closed.  Also, no finite field F is algebraically closed, because if a 1 , a 2 , …, a n  are the elements of F, then the polynomial (x − a 1 )(x − a 2 ) ··· (x − a n ) + 1has no zero in F.

Anatoly Karpov<====>1020<====>Anatoly Karpov   Anatoly Yevgenyevich Karpov ( ; born May 23, 1951) is a Russian chess grandmaster and former World Champion.  He was the official world champion from 1975 to 1985 when he was defeated by Garry Kasparov.  He played three matches against Kasparov for the title from 1986 to 1990, before becoming FIDE World Champion once again after Kasparov broke away from FIDE in 1993.  He held the title until 1999, when he resigned his title in protest against FIDE's new world championship rules.  For his decades-long standing among the world's elite, Karpov is considered by many to be one of the greatest players of all time. 

Aspect ratio<====>1021<====>Aspect ratio  The aspect ratio of a geometric shape is the ratio of its sizes in different dimensions.  For example, the aspect ratio of a rectangle is the ratio of its longer side to its shorter side the ratio of width to height,  when the rectangle is oriented as a "landscape". The aspect ratio is most often expressed as two numbers separated by a colon (x:y), less commonly as a simple or decimal fraction.  The values x and y do not represent actual widths and heights but, rather, the relationship between width and height.  As an example, 8:5, 16:10, 1. 

Auto racing<====>1022<====>Auto racing Auto racing (also known as car racing, motor racing,  or automobile racing) is a motorsport involving the racing of automobiles for competition. Almost as soon as automobiles had been invented, races of various sorts were organised, with the first recorded as early as 1867.  Many of the earliest events were effectively reliability trials, aimed at proving these new machines were a practical mode of transport, but soon became an important way for competing makers to demonstrate their machines.  By the 1930s specialist racing cars had developed.  There are now numerous different categories, each with different rules and regulations. 

Anarcho-capitalism<====>1023<====>Anarcho-capitalism   Anarcho-capitalism is a political philosophy and school of anarchist thought that advocates the elimination of the state in favor of self-ownership, private property, and free markets.  Anarcho-capitalists hold that, in the absence of statute (law by centralized decrees and legislation), society tends to contractually self-regulate and civilize through the discipline of the free market (in what its proponents describe as a voluntary society).   Edward Stringham, Anarchy and the law: the political economy of choice, p 51 In an anarcho-capitalist society, law enforcement, courts, and all other security services would be operated by privately funded competitors rather than centrally through compulsory taxation.

Valens is killed along with over half of his army. 1173 – Construction of the campanile of the Cathedral of Pisa (now known as the Leaning Tower of Pisa) begins; it will take two centuries to complete. 1329 – Quilon, the first Indian Christian Diocese, is erected by Pope John XXII; the French-born Jordanus is appointed the first Bishop. 

Aristophanes<====>1028<====>Aristophanes    Aristophanes (  or  ;   ,  ; c.  446 – c.  386 BC), son of Philippus, of the deme Kydathenaion ( ),  was a comic playwright of ancient Athens.  Eleven of his forty plays survive virtually complete.  These, together with fragments of some of his other plays, provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy, and are used to define it.  Also known as the Father of Comedy  and the Prince of Ancient Comedy,  Aristophanes has been said to recreate the life of ancient Athens more convincingly than any other author. 

Albert Schweitzer<====>1029<====>Albert Schweitzer   Albert Schweitzer, OM (14 January 1875 – 4 September 1965) was a French-German theologian, organist, writer, humanitarian, philosopher, and physician.  A Lutheran, Schweitzer challenged both the secular view of Jesus as depicted by historical-critical methodology current at this time, as well as the traditional Christian view.  His contributions to the interpretation of Pauline Christianity concern the role of Paul's mysticism of “being in Christ” as primary and the doctrine of Justification by Faith as secondary. He received the 1952 Nobel Peace Prize for his philosophy of “Reverence for Life”,  expressed in many ways, but most famously in founding and sustaining the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Lambaréné, now in Gabon, west central Africa (then French Equatorial Africa). 

Austrian School<====>1030<====>Austrian School   The Austrian School is a school of economic thought that is based on methodological individualism – the concept that social phenomena result from the motivations and actions of individuals.    Ludwig von Mises.   Human Action, p.  11, "Purposeful Action and Animal Reaction".  Referenced 2011-11-23.   It originated in late-19th and early-20th century Vienna with the work of Carl Menger, Eugen Böhm von Bawerk, Friedrich von Wieser, and others.   It was methodologically opposed to the Prussian Historical School (in a dispute known as Methodenstreit).  Current-day economists working in this tradition are located in many different countries, but their work is still referred to as Austrian economics. 

Abscess<====>1032<====>Abscess   An abscess is a collection of pus that has built up within the tissue of the body.   Signs and symptoms of abscesses include redness, pain, warmth, and swelling.   The swelling may feel fluid-filled when pressed.   The area of redness often extends beyond the swelling.Carbuncles and boils are types of abscess that often involve hair follicles, with carbuncles being larger.They are usually caused by a bacterial infection.Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection.

Northern cavefish<====>1043<====>Northern cavefish The northern cavefish or northern blindfish, Amblyopsis spelaea, is found in caves through Kentucky and southern Indiana.  It is listed as a threatened species in the United States and the IUCN lists the species as near threatened. During a 2013 study of Amblyopsis spelaea, scientists found that the species was divided into two distinct evolutionary lineages: one north of the Ohio River, in Indiana, and one south of the river, in Kentucky.   The southern population retained the name A.  spelaea and the northern was re-designated Amblyopsis hoosieri in a 2014 paper published in the journal ZooKeys.

Alexis Carrel<====>1051<====>Alexis Carrel Alexis Carrel ( ; 28 June 1873 – 5 November 1944) was a French surgeon and biologist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1912 for pioneering vascular suturing techniques.  He invented the first perfusion pump with Charles A.  Lindbergh opening the way to organ transplantation.  Like many intellectuals of his time, he promoted eugenics.  He was a regent for the French Foundation for the Study of Human Problems during Vichy France which implemented the eugenics policies there; his association with the Foundation and with Jacques Doriot's ultra-nationalist Parti Populaire Français led to investigations of collaborating with the Nazis, but he died before any trial could be held. 

All Souls' Day<====>1055<====>All Souls' DayIn Christianity, All Souls' Day commemorates All Souls, the Holy Souls, or the Faithful Departed; that is, the souls of Christians who have died.  Observing Christians typically remember deceased relatives on the day.    In Western Christianity the annual celebration is now held on 2 November and is associated with the three days of Allhallowtide, including All Saints' Day (1 November) and its vigil, Halloween (31 October).   In the Catholic Church, "the faithful" refers specifically to baptized Catholics; "all souls" commemorates the church penitent of souls in Purgatory, whereas "all saints" commemorates the church triumphant of saints in Heaven. 

Anatole France<====>1057<====>Anatole France( ; born  ,  ; 16 April 1844 – 12 October 1924) was a French poet, journalist, and novelist.  He was a successful novelist, with several best-sellers.  Ironic and skeptical, he was considered in his day the ideal French man of letters.  He was a member of the  , and won the 1921 Nobel Prize in Literature "in recognition of his brilliant literary achievements, characterized as they are by a nobility of style, a profound human sympathy, grace, and a true Gallic temperament".  France is also widely believed to be the model for narrator Marcel's literary idol   in  's In Search of Lost Time. 

André Gide<====>1058<====>André Gide   André Paul Guillaume Gide ( ; 22 November 1869 – 19 February 1951) was a French author and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1947 "for his comprehensive and artistically significant writings, in which human problems and conditions have been presented with a fearless love of truth and keen psychological insight".   Gide's career ranged from its beginnings in the symbolist movement, to the advent of anticolonialism between the two World Wars. Known for his fiction as well as his autobiographical works, Gide exposes to public view the conflict and eventual reconciliation of the two sides of his personality, split apart by a straitlaced traducing of education and a narrow social moralism. 

Algorithms for calculating variance<====>1063<====>Algorithms for calculating varianceAlgorithms for calculating variance play a major role in computational statistics.  A key difficulty in the design of good algorithms for this problem is that formulas for the variance may involve sums of squares, which can lead to numerical instability as well as to arithmetic overflow when dealing with large values. Naïve algorithmA formula for calculating the variance of an entire population of size N is: \sigma^2 = \bar{(x^2)} - \bar x^2 = \displaystyle\frac {\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^2 - (\sum_{i=1}^N x_i)^2/N}{N}.  \! Using Bessel's correction to calculate an unbiased estimate of the population variance from a finite sample of n observations, the formula is: s^2 = \displaystyle\frac {\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - (\sum_{i=1}^n x_i)^2/n}{n-1}. 

Almond<====>1064<====>Almond   The almond (Prunus dulcis, syn.  Prunus amygdalus) is a species of tree native to the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent and North Africa. Almond is also the name of the edible and widely cultivated seed of this tree.  Within the genus Prunus, it is classified with the peach in the subgenus Amygdalus, distinguished from the other subgenera by corrugations on the shell (endocarp) surrounding the seed. The fruit of the almond is a drupe, consisting of an outer hull and a hard shell with the seed, which is not a true nut, inside.  Shelling almonds refers to removing the shell to reveal the seed.

Azerbaijani Armed Forces<====>1088<====>Azerbaijani Armed Forces   The Azerbaijani Armed Forces ( ) were re-established according to the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on the Armed Forces from 9 October 1991.   The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR) had originally formed its own armed forces from 26 June 1918.  However these were dissolved after Azerbaijan was absorbed into the Soviet Union as the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic from 28 April 1920.  After the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991–92 the armed forces were reformed based on Soviet bases and equipment left on Azeri soil. The armed forces have three branches: the Azerbaijani Land Forces, the Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force, and the Azerbaijani Navy. 

Geography of Armenia<====>1091<====>Geography of Armenia Armenia is a landlocked country in the Transcaucasia region, between the Black and Caspian Seas, bordered on the north and east by Georgia and Azerbaijan and on the south and west by Iran and Turkey. The terrain is mostly mountainous and flat, with fast flowing rivers and few forests but with many trees.  The climate is highland continental: hot summers and cold winters.  The land rises to 4,095 m above sea-level at Mount Aragats. Pollution from toxic chemicals such as DDT is not helping the already poor soil quality in many parts of the country.

It was partially formed out of the former Soviet Army forces stationed in the Armenian SSR (mostly units of the 7th Guards Army of the Transcaucasian Military District).   Being a landlocked country, Armenia has no navy. The Commander-in-Chief of the military is the President of Armenia, Serzh Sargsyan.  The Ministry of Defense is in charge of political leadership, headed by Vigen Sargsyan, while military command remains in the hands of the general staff, headed by the Chief of Staff, who is Colonel-General Movses Hakobyan. 

Foreign relations of Armenia<====>1098<====>Foreign relations of Armenia  Armenia has maintained a policy of complementarism by trying to have positive and friendly relations with Iran, Russia, and the West, including the United States and the European Union since its independence.   It has full membership status in a number of international organizations and observer status, etc.  in some others.  However, the dispute over the Armenian Genocide of 1915 and the recent war over Nagorno–Karabakh have created tense relations with two of its immediate neighbors, Azerbaijan and Turkey. Armenian Genocide recognition As of 2017, 29 states have officially recognized the historical events as genocide.

American Samoa is an unincorporated and unorganized territory of the United States, administered by the Office of Insular Affairs, U. S.  Department of the Interior.  Its constitution was ratified 1966 and came into effect 1967.  Executive power is discharged by the governor and the lieutenant governor.  Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of the legislature.  The party system is a based on the United States party system. 

Economy of American Samoa<====>1112<====>Economy of American Samoa   The economy of American Samoa is a traditional Polynesian economy in which more than 90% of the land is communally owned.  Economic activity is strongly linked to the United States, with which American Samoa conducts the great bulk of its foreign trade.  Tuna fishing and processing plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna being the primary export.  Transfers from the U. S.  federal government add substantially to American Samoa's economic well-being.  Attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes.

Avicenna<====>1130<====>AvicennaAvicenna ( ; also Ibn Sīnā or Abu Ali Sina;  ;   – June 1037) was a Persian polymath who is regarded as one of the most significant physicians, astronomers, thinkers and writers of the Islamic Golden Age.    .  .  "He was born in 370/980 in Afshana, his mother's home, near Bukhara.  His native language was Persian" (from "Ibn Sina ("Avicenna")", Encyclopedia of Islam, Brill, second edition (2009).  Accessed via Brill Online at www. encislam. brill. nl). "Avicenna was the greatest of all Persian thinkers; as physician and metaphysician . 

The Ashes<====>1132<====>The Ashes    The Ashes is a Test cricket series played between England and Australia.  The Ashes are regarded as being held by the team that most recently won the Test series.  If the test series is drawn, the team that currently holds the Ashes retains the trophy.  The term originated in a satirical obituary published in a British newspaper, The Sporting Times, immediately after Australia's 1882 victory at The Oval, their first Test win on English soil.  The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and "the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia". 

Analysis<====>1134<====>Analysis  Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it.  The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384–322 B. C. ), though analysis as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.  The word comes from the Ancient Greek ἀνάλυσις (analysis, "a breaking up", from ana- "up, throughout" and lysis "a loosening").  As a formal concept, the method has variously been ascribed to Alhazen,  René Descartes (Discourse on the Method), and Galileo Galilei. 

Abner Doubleday<====>1135<====>Abner Doubleday  Abner Doubleday (June 26, 1819 January 26, 1893) was a career United States Army officer and Union general in the American Civil War.  He fired the first shot in defense of Fort Sumter, the opening battle of the war, and had a pivotal role in the early fighting at the Battle of Gettysburg.  Gettysburg was his finest hour, but his relief by Maj.  Gen.  George G.  Meade caused lasting enmity between the two men.  In San Francisco, after the war, he obtained a patent on the cable car railway that still runs there. 

America's National Game<====>1136<====>America's National Game  America's National Game is a book by Albert Spalding, published in 1911 detailing the early history of the sport of baseball. Much of the story is told first-hand, since Spalding had been involved in the game, first as a player and later an administrator, since the 1850s. In addition to his personal recollections, he had access to the records of Henry Chadwick, the game's first statistician and archivist. Spalding was, however, known to aggrandise his role in the major moments in baseball's history.See alsoHistory of baseballReferences  

Amplitude modulation<====>1140<====>Amplitude modulation Amplitude modulation (AM) is a modulation technique used in electronic communication, most commonly for transmitting information via a radio carrier wave.  In amplitude modulation, the amplitude (signal strength) of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to the waveform being transmitted.   That waveform may, for instance, correspond to the sounds to be reproduced by a loudspeaker, or the light intensity of television pixels.   This technique contrasts with frequency modulation, in which the frequency of the carrier signal is varied, and phase modulation, in which its phase is varied. AM was the earliest modulation method used to transmit voice by radio. 

Augustin-Jean Fresnel<====>1141<====>Augustin-Jean Fresnel  Augustin-Jean Fresnel ( ,  ;  ; 10 May 1788 – 14 July 1827) was a French civil engineer and physicist whose research in optics led to the almost unanimous acceptance of the wave theory of light, excluding any remnant of Newton's corpuscular theory, from the late 1830s   until the end of the 19th century. But he is perhaps better known for inventing the catadioptric (reflective/refractive) Fresnel lens and for pioneering the use of "stepped" lenses to extend the visibility of lighthouses, saving unknown numbers of lives at sea.  The simpler dioptric (purely refractive) stepped lens, first proposed by Count Buffon   and independently reinvented by Fresnel, is used in screen magnifiers and in condenser lenses for overhead projectors. 

Abbot<====>1143<====>Abbot   Abbot, meaning father, is an ecclesiastical title given to the male head of a monastery in various traditions, including Christianity.  The office may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not the head of a monastery.  The female equivalent is abbess. OriginsThe title had its origin in the monasteries of Egypt and Syria, spread through the eastern Mediterranean, and soon became accepted generally in all languages as the designation of the head of a monastery.  The word is derived from the Aramaic av meaning "father" or abba, meaning "my father". 

Ardipithecus<====>1144<====>Ardipithecus  Ardipithecus is a genus of an extinct hominine that lived during Late Miocene and Early Pliocene in Afar Depression, Ethiopia.  Originally described as one of the earliest ancestors of humans after they diverged from the main ape lineage, the relation of this genus to human ancestors and whether it is a hominin is now a matter of debate.Two fossil species are described in the literature: A.  ramidus, which lived about 4. 4 million years ago    during the early Pliocene, and A.  kadabba, dated to approximately 5. 6 million years ago (late Miocene). 

Assembly line<====>1146<====>Assembly line  An assembly line is a manufacturing process (most of the time called a progressive assembly) in which parts (usually interchangeable parts) are added as the semi-finished assembly moves from workstation to workstation where the parts are added in sequence until the final assembly is produced.  By mechanically moving the parts to the assembly work and moving the semi-finished assembly from work station to work station, a finished product can be assembled faster and with less labor than by having workers carry parts to a stationary piece for assembly. Assembly lines are common methods of assembling complex items such as automobiles and other transportation equipment, household appliances and electronic goods. 

Adelaide<====>1148<====>Adelaide    Adelaide  (   )  is the capital city of the state of South Australia, and the fifth-most populous city of Australia.  In June 2016, Adelaide had an estimated resident population of 1,324,279.Adelaide is home to more than 75 percent of the South Australian population, making it the most centralised population of any state in Australia. Adelaide is north of the Fleurieu Peninsula, on the Adelaide Plains between the Gulf St Vincent and the low-lying Mount Lofty Ranges which surround the city.  Adelaide stretches   from the coast to the foothills, and   from Gawler at its northern extent to Sellicks Beach in the south. 

Alan Garner<====>1152<====>Alan Garner    Alan Garner OBE (born 17 October 1934) is an English novelist best known for his children's fantasy novels and his retellings of traditional British folk tales.  Much of his work is firmly rooted in the landscape, history and folklore of his native county of Cheshire, North West England, being set in the region and making use of the native Cheshire dialect. Born in Congleton, Garner grew up around the nearby town of Alderley Edge, and spent much of his youth in the wooded area known locally as 'The Edge', where he gained an early interest in the folklore of the region. 

August 2<====>1154<====>August 2 Events338 BC – A Macedonian army led by Philip II defeated the combined forces of Athens and Thebes in the Battle of Chaeronea, securing Macedonian hegemony in Greece and the Aegean. 216 BC – The Carthaginian army led by Hannibal defeats a numerically superior Roman army at the Battle of Cannae. AD 70  – The armies of Titus destroy the Second Temple as the final blow of the Siege of Jerusalem.  461 – Majorian is arrested near Tortona (northern Italy) and deposed by the Suebian general Ricimer as puppet emperor. 1274 – Edward I of England returns from the Ninth Crusade and is crowned King seventeen days later. 

Algebraic number<====>1158<====>Algebraic number An algebraic number is any complex number (including real numbers) that is a root of a non-zero polynomial (i. e. , a value which causes the polynomial to equal 0) in one variable with rational coefficients (or equivalently – by clearing denominators – with integer coefficients).  All integers and rational numbers are algebraic, as are all roots of integers.  The same is not true for all real numbers or all complex numbers.  Those real and complex numbers which are not algebraic are called transcendental numbers.  They include   and e.  Almost all complex numbers are transcendental. 

Automorphism<====>1160<====>AutomorphismIn mathematics, an automorphism is an isomorphism from a mathematical object to itself.  It is, in some sense, a symmetry of the object, and a way of mapping the object to itself while preserving all of its structure.  The set of all automorphisms of an object forms a group, called the automorphism group.  It is, loosely speaking, the symmetry group of the object. DefinitionIn the context of abstract algebra, a mathematical object is an algebraic structure such as a group, ring, or vector space.  An automorphism is simply a bijective homomorphism of an object with itself. 

Accordion<====>1162<====>Accordion    Accordions (from 19th century German Akkordeon, from Akkord—"musical chord, concord of sounds" ) are a family of box-shaped musical instruments of the bellows-driven free-reed aerophone type, colloquially referred to as a squeezebox.  A person who plays the accordion is called an accordionist.   The concertina and bandoneón are related; the harmonium and American reed organ are in the same family. The instrument is played by compressing or expanding the bellows while pressing buttons or keys, causing pallets to open, which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel, called reeds.  These vibrate to produce sound inside the body. 

Artificial intelligence<====>1164<====>Artificial intelligenceArtificial intelligence (AI, also machine intelligence, MI) is intelligence displayed by machines, in contrast with the natural intelligence  (NI) displayed by humans and other animals.  In computer science  AI research is defined as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal.   Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".   See glossary of artificial intelligence. 

Afro Celt Sound System<====>1166<====>Afro Celt Sound System  Afro Celt Sound System is a musical group who fuse electronic music with traditional Irish and West African music.  Afro Celt Sound System was formed in 1995 by producer-guitarist Simon Emmerson, and feature a wide range of guest artists.    Their albums have been released through Peter Gabriel's Real World Records,  and they have frequently performed at WOMAD festivals worldwide.  Their sales on the label are exceeded only by Gabriel himself.   Their recording contract with Real World was for five albums, of which Volume 5: Anatomic was the last. 

Ancient philosophy<====>1167<====>Ancient philosophy    This page lists some links to ancient philosophy.  In Western philosophy, the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire marked the ending of Hellenistic philosophy and ushered in the beginnings of Medieval philosophy, whereas in Eastern philosophy, the spread of Islam through the Arab Empire marked the end of Old Iranian philosophy and ushered in the beginnings of early Islamic philosophy. IntroductionGenuinely philosophical thought, depending upon original individual insights, arose in many cultures roughly contemporaneously.  Karl Jaspers termed the intense period of philosophical development beginning around the 7th century and concluding around the 3rd century BCE an Axial Age in human thought. 

Anaximander<====>1168<====>Anaximander  Anaximander ( ;   Anaximandros;   was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who lived in Miletus, "Anaximander" in Chambers's Encyclopædia.  London: George Newnes, 1961, Vol.  1, p.  403.   a city of Ionia (in modern-day Turkey).  He belonged to the Milesian school and learned the teachings of his master Thales.  He succeeded Thales and became the second master of that school where he counted Anaximenes and, arguably, Pythagoras amongst his pupils.  Little of his life and work is known today.  According to available historical documents, he is the first philosopher known to have written down his studies,  although only one fragment of his work remains. 

Architect<====>1170<====>Architect    An architect is a person who plans, designs, and reviews the construction of buildings.   To practice architecture means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use.   The Nova Scotia LegislatureEtymologically, architect derives from the Latin architectus, which derives from the Greek (arkhi-, chief + tekton, builder), i. e. , chief builder.  Professionally, an architect's decisions affect public safety, and thus an architect must undergo specialized training consisting of advanced education and a practicum (or internship) for practical experience to earn a license to practice architecture. 

Abbreviation<====>1171<====>Abbreviation  An abbreviation (from Latin brevis, meaning short ) is a shortened form of a word or phrase.   It consists of a group of letters taken from the word or phrase.  For example, the word abbreviation can itself be represented by the abbreviation abbr. , abbrv. , or abbrev. In strict analysis, abbreviations should not be confused with contractions, crasis, acronyms, or initialisms, with which they share some semantic and phonetic functions, though all four are connected by the term "abbreviation" in loose parlance.An abbreviation is a shortening by any method; a contraction is a reduction of size by the drawing together of the parts. 

Aphrodite<====>1174<====>Aphrodite    Aphrodite (   ;   Aphrodítē) is the ancient Greek goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation.  She is identified with the planet Venus, which is named after the Roman goddess  , with whom Aphrodite was extensively syncretized.  Aphrodite's major symbols include myrtle, roses, doves, sparrows, and swans. The cult of Aphrodite was largely derived from that of the Phoenician goddess Astarte, a cognate of the East Semitic goddess Ishtar, whose cult was based on the Sumerian cult of Inanna.  Aphrodite's main cult centers were Cythera, Cyprus, Corinth, and Athens. 

April 1<====>1175<====>April 1 Events286 – Emperor Diocletian elevates his general Maximian to co-emperor with the rank of Augustus and gives him control over the Western regions of the Roman Empire. 325 – Crown Prince Jin Chengdi, age 4, succeeds his father Jin Mingdi as emperor of the Eastern Jin dynasty. 457 – Majorian is acclaimed emperor by the Roman army after defeating 900 Alemanni near Lake Maggiore (Italy). 527 – Byzantine Emperor Justin I names his nephew Justinian I as co-ruler and successor to the throne. 528 – The daughter of Emperor Xiaoming of Northern Wei was made the "Emperor" as a male heir of the late emperor by Empress Dowager Hu, deposed and replaced by Yuan Zhao the next day; she was the first female monarch in the History of China, but not widely recognised. 

Antisymmetric relation<====>1176<====>Antisymmetric relation  In mathematics, a binary relation R on a set X is anti-symmetric if there is no pair of distinct elements of X each of which is related by R to the other.  More formally, R is anti-symmetric precisely if for all a and b in Xif R(a,b) and R(b,a), then a = b,or, equivalently,if R(a,b) with a ≠ b, then R(b,a) must not hold. As a simple example, the divisibility order on the natural numbers is an anti-symmetric relation.  In this context, anti-symmetry means that the only way each of two numbers can be divisible by the other is if the two are, in fact, the same number; equivalently, if n and m are distinct and n is a factor of m, then m cannot be a factor of n. 

Aleister Crowley<====>1177<====>Aleister Crowley    Aleister Crowley ( ; born Edward Alexander Crowley; 12 October 1875 – 1 December 1947) was an English occultist, ceremonial magician, poet, painter, novelist, and mountaineer.  He founded the religion of Thelema, identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the Æon of Horus in the early 20th century.  A prolific writer, he published widely over the course of his life. Born to a wealthy Plymouth Brethren family in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, Crowley rejected the fundamentalist Christian faith to pursue an interest in Western esotericism.  He was educated at the University of Cambridge, where he focused his attentions on mountaineering and poetry, resulting in several publications. 

Afterlife<====>1178<====>Afterlife   The afterlife (also referred to as life after death or the hereafter) is the belief that an essential part of an individual's identity or the stream of consciousness continues to manifest after the death of the physical body.  According to various ideas about the afterlife, the essential aspect of the individual that lives on after death may be some partial element, or the entire soul or spirit, of an individual, which carries with it and may confer personal identity or, on the contrary, may not, as in Indian nirvana.  Belief in an afterlife, which may be naturalistic or supernatural, is in contrast to the belief in oblivion after death. 

Astrometry<====>1181<====>AstrometryAstrometry is the branch of astronomy that involves precise measurements of the positions and movements of stars and other celestial bodies.  The information obtained by astrometric measurements provides information on the kinematics and physical origin of the Solar System and our galaxy, the Milky Way. HistoryThe history of astrometry is linked to the history of star catalogues, which gave astronomers reference points for objects in the sky so they could track their movements.  This can be dated back to Hipparchus, who around 190 BC used the catalogue of his predecessors Timocharis and Aristillus to discover Earth's precession.  In doing so, he also developed the brightness scale still in use today. 

Athena<====>1182<====>Athena    Athena ( ; Attic Greek:  , Athēnā, or  , Athēnaia; Epic:  , Athēnaiē; Doric:  , Athānā) or Athene ( ; Ionic:  , Athēnē), often given the epithet Pallas ( ;  ), is the ancient Greek goddess of wisdom, handicraft, and war.   In later times, Athena was syncretized with the Roman goddess Minerva.  From her origin as an Aegean palace goddess, Athena was regarded as the patron and protectress of various cities across Greece, particularly the city of Athens, from which she received her name. 

Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game<====>1183<====>Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game The Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game is a role-playing game created and written by Erick Wujcik, set in the fictional universe created by author Roger Zelazny for his Chronicles of Amber.  The game is unusual in that no dice are used in resolving conflicts or player actions; instead a simple diceless system of comparative ability, and narrative description of the action by the players and gamemaster, is used to determine how situations are resolved.  Amber DRPG was created in the 1980s, and is much more focused on relationships and roleplaying than most of the roleplaying games of that era. 

Alloy<====>1187<====>Alloy  An alloy is a mixture of metals or a mixture of a metal and another element.  Alloys are defined by a metallic bonding character.   An alloy may be a solid solution of metal elements (a single phase) or a mixture of metallic phases (two or more solutions).  Intermetallic compounds are alloys with a defined stoichiometry and crystal structure.  Zintl phases are also sometimes considered alloys depending on bond types (see also: Van Arkel-Ketelaar triangle for information on classifying bonding in binary compounds). Alloys are used in a wide variety of applications.  In some cases, a combination of metals may reduce the overall cost of the material while preserving important properties. 

Artistic revolution<====>1192<====>Artistic revolution Throughout history, forms of art have gone through periodic abrupt changes called artistic revolutions.   Movements have come to an end to be replaced by a new movement markedly different in striking ways.   See also cultural movements. Artistic revolution and political revolutionsThe role of fine art has been to simultaneously express values of the current culture while also offering criticism, balance, or alternatives to any such values that are proving no longer useful.  So as times change, art changes.  If changes were abrupt they were deemed revolutions.  The best artists have predated society's changes due not to any prescience, but because sensitive perceptivity is part of their talent of seeing. 

Agrarianism<====>1193<====>AgrarianismAgrarianism is a social philosophy or political philosophy which values rural society as superior to urban society, the independent farmer as superior to the paid worker, and sees farming as a way of life that can shape the ideal social values.   It stresses the superiority of a simpler rural life as opposed to the complexity of city life. PhilosophyM.  Thomas Inge defines agrarianism by the following basic tenets: Farming is the sole occupation that offers total independence and self-sufficiency. Urban life, capitalism, and technology destroy independence and dignity and foster vice and weakness. The agricultural community, with its fellowship of labor and co-operation, is the model society. 

Angle<====>1196<====>Angle   In  planar geometry, an angle is the figure formed by two rays, called the sides of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle.  Angles formed by two rays lie in a plane, but this plane does not have to be a Euclidean plane.  Angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes in Euclidean and other spaces.  These are called dihedral angles.  Angles formed by the intersection of two curves in a plane are defined as the angle determined by the tangent rays at the point of intersection. 

Acoustics<====>1198<====>Acoustics Acoustics is the branch of physics that deals with the study of all mechanical waves in gases, liquids, and solids including topics such as vibration, sound, ultrasound and infrasound.  A scientist who works in the field of acoustics is an acoustician while someone working in the field of acoustics technology may be called an acoustical engineer.  The application of acoustics is present in almost all aspects of modern society with the most obvious being the audio and noise control industries. Hearing is one of the most crucial means of survival in the animal world, and speech is one of the most distinctive characteristics of human development and culture. 

Atomic physics<====>1200<====>Atomic physics  Atomic physics is the field of physics that studies atoms as an isolated system of electrons and an atomic nucleus.  It is primarily concerned with the arrangement of electrons around the nucleus andthe processes by which these arrangements change.  This comprises ions, neutral atoms and, unless otherwise stated, it can be assumed that the term atom includes ions. [citation needed]The term atomic physics can be associated with nuclear power and nuclear weapons, due to the synonymous use of atomic and nuclear in standard English.  Physicists distinguish between atomic physics — which deals with the atom as a system consisting of a nucleus and electrons — and nuclear physics, which considers atomic nuclei alone. 

American Sign Language<====>1201<====>American Sign Language   American Sign Language (ASL) is a natural language  that serves as the predominant sign language of Deaf communities in the United States and most of Anglophone Canada.  Besides North America, dialects of ASL and ASL-based creoles are used in many countries around the world, including much of West Africa and parts of Southeast Asia.  ASL is also widely learned as a second language, serving as a lingua franca.  ASL is most closely related to French Sign Language (LSF).  It has been proposed that ASL is a creole language of LSF, although ASL shows features atypical of creole languages, such as agglutinative morphology. 

Applet<====>1202<====>Applet In computing, an applet is any small application that performs one specific task that runs within the scope of a dedicated widget engine or a larger program, often as a plug-in.   "applet: Definition from Answers. com", Answers. com.  Accessed on July 21, 2009  The term is frequently used to refer to a Java applet, a program written in the Java programming language that is designed to be placed on a web page.   Applets are typical examples of transient and auxiliary applications that don't monopolize the user's attention.  Applets are not full-featured application programs, and are intended to be easily accessible. 

Alternate history<====>1203<====>Alternate history   Alternate history or alternative history (Commonwealth English),   sometimes abbreviated as AH,  is a genre of fiction consisting of stories in which one or more historical events occur differently.  These stories usually contain "what if" scenarios at crucial points in history and present outcomes other than those in the historical record.  The stories are conjectural, but are sometimes based on fact.  Alternate history has been seen as a subgenre of literary fiction, science fiction, or historical fiction; alternate history works may use tropes from any or all of these genres.  Another term occasionally used for the genre is "allohistory" (literally "other history"). 

Atomic orbital<====>1206<====>Atomic orbitalIn quantum mechanics, an atomic orbital is a mathematical function that describes the wave-like behavior of either one electron or a pair of electrons in an atom.   This function can be used to calculate the probability of finding any electron of an atom in any specific region around the atom's nucleus.  The term atomic orbital may also refer to the physical region or space where the electron can be calculated to be present, as defined by the particular mathematical form of the orbital.  Each orbital in an atom is characterized by a unique set of values of the three quantum numbers  ,  , and  , which respectively correspond to the electron's energy, angular momentum, and an angular momentum vector component (the magnetic quantum number). 

Amino acid<====>1207<====>Amino acid   Amino acids are organic compounds containing amine (-NH 2 ) and carboxyl (-COOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid.The key elements of an amino acid are carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N), although other elements are found in the side chains of certain amino acids.  About 500 naturally occurring amino acids are known (though only 20 appear in the genetic code) and can be classified in many ways.   They can be classified according to the core structural functional groups' locations as alpha-  (α-) , beta-  (β-) , gamma-  (γ-)  or delta-  (δ-)  amino acids; other categories relate to polarity, pH level, and side chain group type (aliphatic, acyclic, aromatic, containing hydroxyl or sulfur, etc. 

Alan Turing<====>1208<====>Alan Turing Alan Mathison Turing   ( ; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.  Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.  During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. 

Area<====>1209<====>Area Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane.  Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a  three-dimensional object.  Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat.It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept). 

Astronomical unit<====>1210<====>Astronomical unit    The astronomical unit (symbol: au   or ua ) is a unit of length, roughly the distance from Earth to the Sun.  However, that distance varies as Earth orbits the Sun, from a maximum (aphelion) to a minimum (perihelion) and back again once a year.  Originally conceived as the average of Earth's aphelion and perihelion, it is since 2012 defined as exactly   metres (about 150 million kilometres, or 93 million miles).   The astronomical unit is used primarily as a convenient yardstick for measuring distances within the Solar System or around other stars. 

Artist<====>1212<====>Artist  An artist is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the arts, or demonstrating an art.  The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only.  The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors).  "Artiste" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context.  Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism. 

Actaeon<====>1213<====>Actaeon  Actaeon ( ;   Aktaion),  in Greek mythology, son of the priestly herdsman Aristaeus and Autonoe in Boeotia, was a famous Theban hero.   Like Achilles in a later generation, he was trained by the centaur Chiron. He fell to the fatal wrath of Artemis,  but the surviving details of his transgression vary: "the only certainty is in what Aktaion suffered, his pathos, and what Artemis did: the hunter became the hunted; he was transformed into a stag, and his raging hounds, struck with a 'wolf's frenzy' (Lyssa), tore him apart as they would a stag. 

Anglicanism<====>1214<====>AnglicanismAnglicanism is a Western Christian tradition that evolved out of the practices, liturgy and identity of the Church of England following the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century.Adherents of Anglicanism are called "Anglicans".  The majority of Anglicans are members of national or regional ecclesiastical provinces of the international Anglican Communion,    which forms the third-largest Christian communion in the world, after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church.   They are in full communion with the See of Canterbury, and thus the Archbishop of Canterbury, whom the communion refers to as its primus inter pares (Latin, "first among equals"). 

Athens<====>1216<====>Athens    Athens ( ;   , Athína  ,  , Athênai) is the capital and largest city of Greece.  Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years   and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennium BC.  Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens.  A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum,   it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy,   largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. 

Anguilla<====>1217<====>AnguillaAnguilla (   ) is a British overseas territory in the Caribbean.It is one of the most northerly of the Leeward Islands in the Lesser Antilles, lying east of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and directly north of Saint Martin.  The territory consists of the main island of Anguilla, approximately   long by   wide at its widest point, together with a number of much smaller islands and cays with no permanent population.  The island's capital is The Valley.  The total land area of the territory is  ,    with a population of approximately   (  estimate).

Ashmore and Cartier Islands<====>1227<====>Ashmore and Cartier Islands   The Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands    is an uninhabited external territory  of Australia consisting of four low-lying tropical islands in two separate reefs, and the 12 nautical mile territorial sea generated by the islands.   The territory is located in the Indian Ocean situated on the edge of the continental shelf, about   off the northwest coast of Australia and   south of the Indonesian island of Rote.    Ashmore Reef is called Pulau Pasir by Indonesians and it is called Nusa Solokaek in the Rotenese language. 

Acoustic theory<====>1234<====>Acoustic theoryAcoustic theory is a scientific field that relates to the description of sound waves. It derives from fluid dynamics. See acoustics for the engineering approach.Propagation of sound waves in a fluid (such as water) can be modeled by an equation of continuity (conservation of mass) and an equation of motion (conservation of momentum) .  With some simplifications, in particular constant density, they can be given as follows:  \begin{align}    \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \kappa~\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} & = 0  \qquad \text{(Mass balance)} \\    \rho_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \nabla p & = 0  \qquad \text{(Momentum balance)} \end{align} where  p(\mathbf{x}, t)  is the acoustic pressure and  \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x}, t)  is the flow velocity vector,  \mathbf{x}  is the vector of spatial coordinates  x, y, z ,  t  is the time,  \rho_0  is the static mass density of the medium and  \kappa  is the bulk modulus of the medium.  The bulk modulus can be expressed in terms of the density and the speed of sound in the medium ( c_0 ) as \kappa = \rho_0 c_0^2 ~. If the flow velocity field is irrotational,   \nabla \times \mathbf{u}=\mathbf{0} , then the acoustic wave equation is a combination of these two sets of balance equations and can be expressed as    \cfrac{\partial^2 \mathbf{u}}{\partial t^2} - c_0^2~\nabla^2\mathbf{u} = 0  \qquad \text{or} \qquad  \cfrac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} - c_0^2~\nabla^2 p = 0, where we have used the vector Laplacian,   \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}) - \nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{u})  .The acoustic wave equation (and the mass and momentum balance equations) are often expressed in terms of a scalar potential  \varphi  where  \mathbf{u} = \nabla\varphi .  In that case the acoustic wave equation is written as  \cfrac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial t^2} - c_0^2~\nabla^2 \varphi = 0 and the momentum balance and mass balance are expressed as   p + \rho_0~\cfrac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t} = 0 ~;~~  \rho + \cfrac{\rho_0}{c_0^2}~\cfrac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t} = 0 ~. Derivation of the governing equationsThe derivations of the above equations for waves in an acoustic medium are given below.Conservation of momentumThe equations for the conservation of linear momentum for a fluid medium are   \rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u}\right) = -\nabla p + \nabla \cdot\boldsymbol{\tau} + \rho\mathbf{g} where  \mathbf{g}  is the body force per unit mass,  p  is the pressure, and  \boldsymbol{\tau}  is the deviatoric stress.  If  \boldsymbol{\sigma}  is the Cauchy stress, then   p := -\tfrac{1}{3}~\text{tr}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) ~;~~  \boldsymbol{\sigma} := -p\boldsymbol{I} + \boldsymbol{\tau} where   \boldsymbol{I}  is the rank-2 identity tensor.We make several assumptions to derive the momentum balance equation for an acoustic medium.  These assumptions and the resulting forms of the momentum equations are outlined below.Assumption 1: Newtonian fluidIn acoustics, the fluid medium is assumed to be Newtonian.  For a Newtonian fluid, the deviatoric stress tensor is related to the flow velocity by \boldsymbol{\tau} = \mu~\left[\nabla\mathbf{u} + (\nabla\mathbf{u})^T\right] + \lambda~(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u})~\boldsymbol{I} where  \mu  is the shear viscosity and  \lambda  is the bulk viscosity.Therefore, the divergence of  \boldsymbol{\tau}  is given by  \begin{align}  \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{\tau} \equiv \cfrac{\partial s_{ij}}{\partial x_i} & =\mu \left[\cfrac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\left(\cfrac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}+\cfrac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}\right)\right] + \lambda~\left[\cfrac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\left(\cfrac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_k}\right)\right]\delta_{ij} \\   & = \mu~\cfrac{\partial^2 u_i}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} + \mu~\cfrac{\partial^2 u_j}{\partial x_i\partial x_i} + \lambda~\cfrac{\partial^2 u_k}{\partial x_k\partial x_j} \\   & = (\mu + \lambda)~\cfrac{\partial^2 u_i}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} + \mu~\cfrac{\partial^2 u_j}{\partial x_i^2} \\   & \equiv (\mu + \lambda)~\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}) + \mu~\nabla^2\mathbf{u} ~.  \end{align} Using the identity  \nabla^2\mathbf{u} = \nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}) - \nabla\times\nabla\times\mathbf{u} , we have  \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{\tau} = (2\mu + \lambda)~\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}) -\mu~\nabla\times\nabla\times\mathbf{u}~.  The equations for the conservation of momentum may then be written as   \rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u}\right) = -\nabla p + (2\mu + \lambda)~\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}) -\mu~\nabla\times\nabla\times\mathbf{u} + \rho\mathbf{g} Assumption 2: Irrotational flowFor most acoustics problems we assume that the flow is irrotational, that is, the vorticity is zero.  In that case   \nabla\times\mathbf{u} = 0 and the momentum equation reduces to   \rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u}\right) = -\nabla p + (2\mu + \lambda)~\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}) + \rho\mathbf{g} Assumption 3: No body forcesAnother frequently made assumption is that effect of body forces on the fluid medium is negligible.  The momentum equation then further simplifies to   \rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u}\right) = -\nabla p + (2\mu + \lambda)~\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}) Assumption 4: No viscous forcesAdditionally, if we assume that there are no viscous forces in the medium (the bulk and shear viscosities are zero), the momentum equation takes the form   \rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u}\right) = -\nabla p Assumption 5: Small disturbancesAn important simplifying assumption for acoustic waves is that the amplitude of the disturbance of the field quantities is small.  This assumption leads to the linear or small signal acoustic wave equation.  Then we can express the variables as the sum of the (time averaged) mean field ( \langle\cdot\rangle ) that varies in space and a small fluctuating field ( \tilde{\cdot} ) that varies in space and time.  That is   p = \langle p\rangle + \tilde{p} ~;~~  \rho = \langle\rho\rangle + \tilde{\rho} ~;~~  \mathbf{u} = \langle\mathbf{u}\rangle + \tilde{\mathbf{u}} and   \cfrac{\partial\langle p \rangle}{\partial t} = 0 ~;~~ \cfrac{\partial\langle \rho \rangle}{\partial t} = 0 ~;~~  \cfrac{\partial\langle \mathbf{u} \rangle}{\partial t} = \mathbf{0} ~. Then the momentum equation can be expressed as   \left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right] \left[\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{u}}}{\partial t}  + \left[\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle+\tilde{\mathbf{u}}\right] \cdot \nabla \left[\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle+\tilde{\mathbf{u}}\right]\right] = -\nabla \left[\langle p\rangle+\tilde{p}\right] Since the fluctuations are assumed to be small, products of the fluctuation terms can be neglected (to first order) and we have  \begin{align}  \langle\rho\rangle~\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{u}}}{\partial t} & +  \left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\left[\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle\cdot\nabla \langle\mathbf{u}\rangle\right]+  \langle\rho\rangle\left[\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle\cdot\nabla\tilde{\mathbf{u}} +    \tilde{\mathbf{u}}\cdot\nabla\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle\right] \\  & = -\nabla \left[\langle p\rangle+\tilde{p}\right] \end{align} Assumption 6: Homogeneous mediumNext we assume that the medium is homogeneous; in the sense that the time averaged variables \langle p \rangle  and  \langle \rho \rangle  have zero gradients, i.e.,  \nabla\langle p \rangle =  0 ~;~~ \nabla\langle \rho \rangle = 0 ~. The momentum equation then becomes   \langle\rho\rangle~\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{u}}}{\partial t} +  \left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\left[\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle\cdot\nabla \langle\mathbf{u}\rangle\right]+  \langle\rho\rangle\left[\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle\cdot\nabla\tilde{\mathbf{u}} +    \tilde{\mathbf{u}}\cdot\nabla\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle\right]  = -\nabla\tilde{p} Assumption 7: Medium at restAt this stage we assume that the medium is at rest, which implies that the mean flow velocity is zero, i.e.,  \langle\mathbf{u}\rangle = 0  .  Then the balance of momentum reduces to    \langle\rho\rangle~\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{u}}}{\partial t} = -\nabla\tilde{p} Dropping the tildes and using  \rho_0 := \langle\rho\rangle , we get the commonly used form of the acoustic momentum equation    \rho_0~\frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \nabla p = 0 ~. Conservation of massThe equation for the conservation of mass in a fluid volume (without any mass sources or sinks) is given by \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0 where  \rho(\mathbf{x},t)  is the mass density of the fluid and  \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},t)  is the flow velocity.The equation for the conservation of mass for an acoustic medium can also be derived in a manner similar to that used for the conservation of momentum.Assumption 1: Small disturbancesFrom the assumption of small disturbances we have   p = \langle p\rangle + \tilde{p} ~;~~  \rho = \langle\rho\rangle + \tilde{\rho} ~;~~  \mathbf{u} = \langle\mathbf{u}\rangle + \tilde{\mathbf{u}} and   \cfrac{\partial\langle p \rangle}{\partial t} = 0 ~;~~ \cfrac{\partial\langle \rho \rangle}{\partial t} = 0 ~;~~  \cfrac{\partial\langle \mathbf{u} \rangle}{\partial t} = \mathbf{0} ~. Then the mass balance equation can be written as  \frac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t} +   \left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\nabla \cdot\left[\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle+\tilde{\mathbf{u}}\right] +  \nabla\left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\cdot \left[\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle+\tilde{\mathbf{u}}\right]= 0  If we neglect higher than first order terms in the fluctuations, the mass balance equation becomes  \frac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t} +   \left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\nabla \cdot\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle+   \langle\rho\rangle\nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{u}} +   \nabla\left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\cdot\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle+   \nabla\langle\rho\rangle\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{u}}= 0  Assumption 2: Homogeneous mediumNext we assume that the medium is homogeneous, i.e.,  \nabla\langle \rho \rangle = 0 ~. Then the mass balance equation takes the form  \frac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t} +   \left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\nabla \cdot\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle+   \langle\rho\rangle\nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{u}} +   \nabla\tilde{\rho}\cdot\langle\mathbf{u}\rangle   = 0  Assumption 3: Medium at restAt this stage we assume that the medium is at rest, i.e.,  \langle\mathbf{u}\rangle = 0  .  Then the mass balance equation can be expressed as  \frac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t} +   \langle\rho\rangle\nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{u}} = 0  Assumption 4: Ideal gas, adiabatic, reversibleTo close the system of equations we need an equation of state for the pressure.  To do that we assume that the medium is an ideal gas and all acoustic waves compress the medium in an adiabatic and reversible manner.  The equation of state can then be expressed in the form of the differential equation:    \cfrac{dp}{d\rho} = \cfrac{\gamma~p}{\rho} ~;~~ \gamma := \cfrac{c_p}{c_v} ~;~~ c^2 = \cfrac{\gamma~p}{\rho} ~. where  c_p  is the specific heat at constant pressure,  c_v  is the specific heat at constant volume, and  c  is the wave speed.  The value of  \gamma  is 1.4 if the acoustic medium is air.For small disturbances   \cfrac{dp}{d\rho} \approx \cfrac{\tilde{p}}{\tilde{\rho}}  ~;~~  \cfrac{p}{\rho} \approx \cfrac{\langle p \rangle}{\langle \rho \rangle} ~;~~  c^2 \approx c_0^2 = \cfrac{\gamma~\langle p\rangle}{\langle \rho \rangle} ~. where  c_0  is the speed of sound in the medium.Therefore,   \cfrac{\tilde{p}}{\tilde{\rho}} = \gamma~\cfrac{\langle p \rangle}{\langle \rho \rangle}    = c_0^2 \qquad \implies \qquad  \cfrac{\partial\tilde{p}}{\partial t} = c_0^2 \cfrac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t} The balance of mass can then be written as  \cfrac{1}{c_0^2}\frac{\partial\tilde{p}}{\partial t} +   \langle\rho\rangle\nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{u}} = 0  Dropping the tildes and defining  \rho_0 :=  \langle\rho\rangle  gives us the commonly used expression for the balance of mass in an acoustic medium:  \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \rho_0~c_0^2~\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} = 0 ~.  Governing equations in cylindrical coordinatesIf we use a cylindrical coordinate system  (r,\theta,z)  with basis vectors  \mathbf{e}_r, \mathbf{e}_\theta, \mathbf{e}_z , then the gradient of  p  and the divergence of  \mathbf{u}  are given by   \begin{align}    \nabla p & = \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_r + \cfrac{1}{r}~\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial \theta}~\mathbf{e}_\theta + \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_z \\    \nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} & = \cfrac{\partial u_r}{\partial r} + \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial \theta} + u_r\right) + \cfrac{\partial u_z}{\partial z}  \end{align} where the flow velocity has been expressed as  \mathbf{u} = u_r~\mathbf{e}_r+u_\theta~\mathbf{e}_\theta+u_z~\mathbf{e}_z .The equations for the conservation of momentum may then be written as   \rho_0~\left[\cfrac{\partial u_r}{\partial t}~\mathbf{e}_r+\cfrac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial t}~\mathbf{e}_\theta+\cfrac{\partial u_z}{\partial t}~\mathbf{e}_z\right] +\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_r + \cfrac{1}{r}~\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial \theta}~\mathbf{e}_\theta + \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_z = 0 In terms of components, these three equations for the conservation of momentum in cylindrical coordinates are    \rho_0~\cfrac{\partial u_r}{\partial t} + \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial r}  = 0 ~;~~   \rho_0~\cfrac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial t} + \cfrac{1}{r}~\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial \theta}  = 0 ~;~~   \rho_0~\cfrac{\partial u_z}{\partial t} + \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial z}  = 0 ~. The equation for the conservation of mass can similarly be written in cylindrical coordinates as   \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \kappa\left[\cfrac{\partial u_r}{\partial r} + \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial \theta} + u_r\right) + \cfrac{\partial u_z}{\partial z}\right] = 0 ~. Time harmonic acoustic equations in cylindrical coordinatesThe acoustic equations for the conservation of momentum and the conservation of mass are often expressed in time harmonic form (at fixed frequency).  In that case, the pressures and the flow velocity are assumed to be time harmonic functions of the form   p(\mathbf{x}, t) = \hat{p}(\mathbf{x})~e^{-i\omega t} ~;~~  \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x}, t) = \hat{\mathbf{u}}(\mathbf{x})~e^{-i\omega t} ~;~~ i := \sqrt{-1} where  \omega  is the frequency.  Substitution of these expressions into the governing equations in cylindrical coordinates gives us the fixed frequency form of the conservation of momentum   \cfrac{\partial\hat{p}}{\partial r} = i\omega~\rho_0~\hat{u}_r ~;~~  \cfrac{1}{r}~\cfrac{\partial\hat{p}}{\partial \theta} = i\omega~\rho_0~\hat{u}_\theta ~;~~   \cfrac{\partial\hat{p}}{\partial z} = i\omega~\rho_0~\hat{u}_z and the fixed frequency form of the conservation of mass   \cfrac{i\omega \hat{p}}{\kappa} = \cfrac{\partial \hat{u}_r}{\partial r} + \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{\partial \hat{u}_\theta}{\partial \theta} + \hat{u}_r\right) + \cfrac{\partial \hat{u}_z}{\partial z} ~. Special case: No z-dependenceIn the special case where the field quantities are independent of the z-coordinate we can eliminate  u_r, u_\theta  to get   \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial p}{\partial r} +    \frac{1}{r^2}~\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial\theta^2} + \frac{\omega^2\rho_0}{\kappa}~p = 0 Assuming that the solution of this equation can be written as    p(r,\theta) = R(r)~Q(\theta) we can write the partial differential equation as   \cfrac{r^2}{R}~\cfrac{d^2R}{dr^2} + \cfrac{r}{R}~\cfrac{dR}{dr} + \cfrac{r^2\omega^2\rho_0}{\kappa} = -\cfrac{1}{Q}~\cfrac{d^2Q}{d\theta^2} The left hand side is not a function of  \theta  while the right hand side is not a function of  r .  Hence,   r^2~\cfrac{d^2R}{dr^2} + r~\cfrac{dR}{dr} + \cfrac{r^2\omega^2\rho_0}{\kappa}~R = \alpha^2~R ~;~~ \cfrac{d^2Q}{d\theta^2} = -\alpha^2~Q where  \alpha^2  is a constant.  Using the substitution   \tilde{r} \leftarrow \left(\omega\sqrt{\cfrac{\rho_0}{\kappa}}\right) r = k~r we have   \tilde{r}^2~\cfrac{d^2R}{d\tilde{r}^2} + \tilde{r}~\cfrac{dR}{d\tilde{r}} + (\tilde{r}^2-\alpha^2)~R = 0 ~;~~ \cfrac{d^2Q}{d\theta^2} = -\alpha^2~Q The equation on the left is the Bessel equation, which has the general solution   R(r) =  A_\alpha~J_\alpha(k~r) + B_\alpha~J_{-\alpha}(k~r) where  J_\alpha  is the cylindrical Bessel function of the first kind and  A_\alpha, B_\alpha  are undetermined constants.  The equation on the right has the general solution   Q(\theta) = C_\alpha~e^{i\alpha\theta} + D_\alpha~e^{-i\alpha\theta} where  C_\alpha,D_\alpha  are undetermined constants.

Alexander Mackenzie (politician)<====>1235<====>Alexander Mackenzie (politician)    Alexander Mackenzie, PC (January 28, 1822 April 17, 1892), was a Canadian politician who served as the second Prime Minister of Canada, in office from 1873 to 1878. Mackenzie was born in Logierait, Perthshire, Scotland.  He left school at the age of 13, following his father's death, and trained as a stonemason.  Mackenzie immigrated to Canada when he was 20, settling in what became Ontario.  His masonry business prospered, allowing him to pursue other interests – such as the editorship of a pro-Reformist newspaper.  Mackenzie was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada in 1861, as a supporter of George Brown. 

Ashoka<====>1239<====>Ashoka  Ashoka ( ;  ; died 232 BCE) , or Ashoka the Great, was an Indian emperor of the Maurya Dynasty, who ruled almost all of the Indian subcontinent from   to 232 BCE.   He was the grandson of the founder of the Maurya Dynasty, Chandragupta Maurya, who had created one of the largest empires in ancient India and then, according to Jain sources, renounced it all to become a Jain monk.One of India's greatest emperors, Ashoka expanded Chandragupta's empire, and reigned over a realm that stretched from present-day Afghanistan in the west to Bangladesh in the east. 

American (word)<====>1241<====>American (word) The meaning of the word American in the English language varies according to the historical, geographical, and political context in which it is used.  American is derived from America, a term originally denoting all of the New World (also called the Americas).  In some expressions, it retains this Pan-American sense, but its usage has evolved over time and, for various historical reasons, the word came to denote people or things specifically from the United States of America. In modern English, American generally refers to persons or things related to the United States of America; among native English speakers this usage is almost universal, with any other use of the term requiring specification. 

Ada (programming language)<====>1242<====>Ada (programming language) Ada is a structured, statically typed, imperative, wide-spectrum, and object-oriented high-level computer programming language, extended from Pascal and other languages.  It has built-in language support for design-by-contract, extremely strong typing, explicit concurrency, offering tasks, synchronous message passing, protected objects, and non-determinism.  Ada improves code safety and maintainability by using the compiler to find errors in favor of runtime errors.  Ada is an international standard; the current version (known as Ada 2012 ) is defined by ISO/IEC 8652:2012.    Ada was originally designed by a team led by Jean Ichbiah of CII Honeywell Bull under contract to the United States Department of Defense (DoD) from 1977 to 1983 to supersede over 450 programming languages used by the DoD at that time.

He is best known for his dramas A Little Princess (1995) and Y Tu Mamá También (2001), fantasy film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), and science fiction thrillers Children of Men (2006) and Gravity (2013).  Cuarón is the first Mexican director to win an Oscar for Best Director.  Most of his work has been praised by both audiences and critics, and has been nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Original Screenplay for Y Tu Mamá También, and both Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing for Children of Men. 

Arianism<====>1252<====>Arianism    In Christianity, Arianism is a Christological  concept which asserts the belief that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who was begotten by God the Father at a point in time, is distinct from the Father and is therefore subordinate to the Father.  https://ehrmanblog. org/the-controversies-about-christ-arius-and-alexander/  Arian teachings were first attributed to Arius (c.  AD 256–336), a Christian presbyter in Alexandria, Egypt.  The teachings of Arius and his supporters were opposed to the theological views held by Homoousian Christians, regarding the nature of the Trinity and the nature of Christ.  The Arian concept of Christ is based on the belief that the Son of God did not always exist but was begotten by God the Father.

Antoninus Pius<====>1256<====>Antoninus Pius  Antoninus Pius ( ;   19 September 86 7 March 161), also known as Antoninus, was Roman emperor from 138 to 161.  He was one of the Five Good Emperors in the Nerva–Antonine dynasty and the Aurelii.  Bowman, p.  150 Born into a senatorial family, Antoninus held various offices during the reign of emperor Hadrian, acquiring favour which saw him adopted as Hadrian's son and successor shortly before Hadrian's death.  He acquired the name Pius after his accession to the throne, either because he compelled the Senate to deify his adoptive father Hadrian,  or because he had saved senators sentenced to death by Hadrian in his later years.

Advanced Encryption Standard<====>1260<====>Advanced Encryption Standard The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known by its original name Rijndael ( ),is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U. S.  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001.    AES is a subset of the Rijndael cipher    developed by two Belgian cryptographers, Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen, who submitted a proposal to NIST during the AES selection process.   Rijndael is a family of ciphers with different key and block sizes. For AES, NIST selected three members of the Rijndael family, each with a block size of 128 bits, but three different key lengths: 128, 192 and 256 bits.

Argot<====>1262<====>Argot   An argot ( ; from French argot   'slang') is a secret language used by various groups—e. g. , schoolmates, outlaws, colleagues, among many others—to prevent outsiders from understanding their conversations.  The term argot is also used to refer to the informal specialized vocabulary from a particular field of study, occupation, or hobby, in which sense it overlaps with jargon.  The discipline of medicine has been referred to as having its own argot which includes abbreviations, acronyms, and "technical colloquialisms".   Author Victor Hugo was one of the first to research argot extensively. 

Anisotropy<====>1264<====>Anisotropy  Anisotropy  ,   is the property of being directionally dependent, which implies different properties in different directions, as opposed to isotropy.  It can be defined as a difference, when measured along different axes, in a material's physical or mechanical properties (absorbance, refractive index, conductivity, tensile strength, etc. ) An example of anisotropy is the light coming through a polarizer.  Another is wood, which is easier to split along its grain than against it. Fields of interestComputer graphicsIn the field of computer graphics, an anisotropic surface changes in appearance as it rotates about its geometric normal, as is the case with velvet. 

Alpha decay<====>1267<====>Alpha decay Alpha decay or α-decay is a type of radioactive decay in which an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle (helium nucleus) and thereby transforms or 'decays' into an atom with a mass number that is reduced by four and an atomic number that is reduced by two.  An alpha particle is identical to the nucleus of a helium-4 atom, which consists of two protons and two neutrons.  It has a charge of +2e and a mass of 4u.   For example, uranium-238 decays to form thorium-234.  Alpha particles have a charge +2, but as a nuclear equation describes a nuclear reaction without considering the electrons – a convention that does not imply that the nuclei necessarily occur in neutral atoms – the charge is not usually shown. 

Extreme poverty<====>1270<====>Extreme povertyExtreme poverty, absolute poverty, destitution, or penury, was originally defined by the United Nations in 1995 as "a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education and information.  It depends not only on income but also on access to services. "  In 2008, "extreme poverty" widely refers to earning below the international poverty line of $1. 25/day (in 2005 prices), set by the World Bank.  This measure is the equivalent to earning $1. 00 a day in 1996 US prices, hence the widely used expression, living on "less than a dollar a day". 

Analytical Engine<====>1271<====>Analytical Engine The Analytical Engine was a proposed mechanical general-purpose computer designed by English mathematician and computer pioneer Charles Babbage. It was first described in 1837 as the successor to Babbage's difference engine, a design for a mechanical computer.   The Analytical Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first  design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete. In other words, the logical structure of the Analytical Engine was essentially the same as that which has dominated computer design in the electronic era. 

Augustus<====>1273<====>Augustus    Augustus ( ; Classical Latin spelling and reconstructed Classical Latin pronunciation of the names of Augustus:    The spelling  , indicating the pronunciation  , occurs in inscriptions ( ).means "Commander Caesar, Son of the God [Julius Caesar], the Venerable".   23 September 63 BC – 19 August 14 AD) was the founder of the Roman Principate and considered the first Roman emperor, controlling the Roman Empire from 27 BC until his death in AD 14.  The dates of his rule are contemporary dates; Augustus lived under two calendars, the Roman Republican until 45 BC, and the Julian after 45 BC. 

Geography of Antarctica<====>1274<====>Geography of Antarctica  The geography of Antarctica is dominated by its south polar location and, thus, by ice.   The Antarctic continent, located in the Earth's southern hemisphere, is centered asymmetrically around the South Pole and largely south of the Antarctic Circle.   It is washed by the Southern (or Antarctic) Ocean or, depending on definition, the southern Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans.  It has an area of more than 14 million km². Some 98% of Antarctica is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, the world's largest ice sheet and also its largest reservoir of fresh water. 

Transport in Antarctica<====>1279<====>Transport in Antarctica Transport in Antarctica has transformed from explorers crossing the isolated remote area of Antarctica by foot to a more open area due to human technologies enabling more convenient and faster transport, predominantly by air and water, as well as land.  Transportation technologies on a remote area like Antarctica need to be able to deal with extremely low temperatures and continuous winds to ensure the travelers' safety.  Due to the fragility of the Antarctic environment, only a limited amount of transport movements can take place and sustainable transportation technologies have to be used to reduce the ecological footprint. 

Geography of Alabama<====>1285<====>Geography of Alabama This article will go through a wide range of topics of the geography of the state of Alabama.  It is 30th in size and borders four U. S.  states: Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida.  It also borders the Gulf of Mexico. Physical features Extending entirely across the state of Alabama for about   northern boundary, and in the middle stretching   farther south, is the Cumberland Plateau, or Tennessee Valley region, broken into broad tablelands by the dissection of rivers.  In the northern part of this plateau, west of Jackson county, there are about   of level highlands from   above sea level. 

List of Governors of Alabama<====>1286<====>List of Governors of Alabama The Governor of Alabama is the chief executive of the U. S.  state of Alabama.  The governor is the head of the executive branch of Alabama's state government and is charged with enforcing state laws.  The governor has the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Alabama Legislature, to convene the legislature, and to grant pardons, except in cases of impeachment.   The governor is also the commander-in-chief of the state's military forces. The Governor of Alabama is permitted to serve a maximum of two consecutive terms before being term limited. 

Apocrypha<====>1288<====>Apocrypha Apocrypha are works, usually written, of unknown authorship or of doubtful origin.   Biblical apocrypha is a set of texts included in the Latin Vulgate and Septuagint but not in the Hebrew Bible.  While Catholic tradition considers the texts to be deuterocanonical, Protestants consider them apocryphal.  Thus, Protestant bibles do not include the books within the Old Testament but have often included them in a separate section.  Other non-canonical apocryphal texts are generally called pseudepigrapha, a term that means "false writings".    The word's origin is the Medieval Latin adjective apocryphus, "secret, or non-canonical", from the Greek adjective   (apokryphos), "obscure", from the verb   (apokryptein), "to hide away". 

Antarctic Treaty System<====>1291<====>Antarctic Treaty System The Antarctic Treaty and related agreements, collectively known as the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), regulate international relations with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only continent without a native human population.  For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all of the land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude.  The treaty entered into force in 1961 and currently has 53 parties.The treaty sets aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, establishes freedom of scientific investigation and bans military activity on the continent.  The treaty was the first arms control agreement established during the Cold War. 

Alfred Lawson<====>1293<====>Alfred Lawson  Alfred William Lawson (March 24, 1869 – November 29, 1954) was a professional baseball player, manager, and league promoter from 1887 through 1916 and went on to play a pioneering role in the U. S.  aircraft industry.  He published two early aviation trade journals. He is frequently cited as the inventor of the airliner and was awarded several of the first air mail contracts, which he ultimately could not fulfill.  He founded the Lawson Aircraft Company in Green Bay, Wisconsin, to build military training aircraft and later the Lawson Airplane Company in South Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to build airliners. 

Ames, Iowa<====>1298<====>Ames, Iowa    Ames is a city located in the central part of Story County, Iowa, United States.   It is located approximately   north of Des Moines, and had a 2010 population of 58,965.  The U. S.  Census Bureau designates the Ames metropolitan statistical area as encompassing all of Story County; combined with the Boone, Iowa micropolitan statistical area (Boone County, Iowa), the pair make up the larger Ames-Boone combined statistical area.  While Ames is the largest city in Story County, the county seat is in the nearby city of Nevada   east of Ames. 

Abalone<====>1300<====>Abalone   Abalone (  or  ; via Spanish  , from the   Rumsen language aulón ) is a common name for any of a group of small to very large sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the family Haliotidae.  Other common names are ear shells, sea ears, and muttonfish or muttonshells in Australia, ormer in Great Britain, perlemoen in South Africa, and   in New Zealand.Abalone are marine snails.  Their taxonomy puts them in the family Haliotidae which contains only one genus, Haliotis, which once contained six subgenera. 

Abbess<====>1301<====>Abbess In Christianity, an abbess (Latin abbatissa, feminine form of abbas, abbot) is the female superior of a community of nuns, which is often an abbey.  DescriptionIn the Catholic Church (both the Latin Church and Eastern Catholic), Eastern Orthodox, Coptic and Anglican abbeys, the mode of election, position, rights, and authority of an abbess correspond generally with those of an abbot.She must be at least 40 years old and have been a nun for 10 years.The age requirement in the Catholic Church has evolved over time, ranging from 30 to 60. 

Abdominal surgery<====>1303<====>Abdominal surgery The term abdominal surgery broadly covers surgical procedures that involve opening the abdomen.   Surgery of each abdominal organ is dealt with separately in connection with the description of that organ (see stomach, kidney, liver, etc. ) Diseases affecting the abdominal cavity are dealt with generally under their own names (e. g.  appendicitis). TypesThe most common abdominal surgeries are described below. Appendectomy—Surgical opening of the abdominal cavity and removal of the appendix.   Typically performed as definitive treatment for appendicitis, although sometimes the appendix is prophylactically removed incidental to another abdominal procedure. Caesarean section (also known as C-section) is a surgical procedure in which one or more incisions are made through a mother's abdomen (laparotomy) and uterus (hysterotomy) to deliver one or more babies, or, rarely, to remove a dead fetus. 

Abensberg<====>1305<====>Abensberg Abensberg ( ) is a town in the Lower Bavarian district of Kelheim, in Bavaria, Germany, lying around 30 km southwest of Regensburg, 40 km east of Ingolstadt, 50 northwest of Landshut and 100 km north of Munich.  It is situated on the Abens river, a tributary of the Danube. GeographyThe town lies on the Abens river, a tributary of the Danube, around eight kilometres from the river's source.  The area around Abensberg is characterized by the narrow valley of the Danube, where the Weltenburg Abbey stands, the valley of the Altmühl in the north, a left tributary of the Danube, and the famous Hallertau hops-planting region in the south. 

Arminianism<====>1306<====>Arminianism    Arminianism is based on theological ideas of the Dutch Reformed theologian Jacobus Arminius (1560–1609) and his historic supporters known as Remonstrants.  His teachings held to the five solae of the Reformation, but they were distinct from particular teachings of Martin Luther, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin, and other Protestant Reformers.  Jacobus Arminius (Jakob Harmenszoon) was a student of Theodore Beza (Calvin's successor) at the Theological University of Geneva.  Arminianism is known to some as a soteriological diversification of Protestant Calvinist Christianity.   However, to others, Arminianism is a reclamation of early Church theological consensus. 

The Alan Parsons Project<====>1307<====>The Alan Parsons Project    The Alan Parsons Project was the collective reference to several lineups of a British progressive rock band, active between 1975 and 1990,  whose rosters consisted of Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson surrounded by a varying number of session musicians and some relatively consistent band members such as guitarist Ian Bairnson, arranger Andrew Powell, bassist and vocalist David Paton, drummer Stuart Elliott, and vocalist Lenny Zakatek. Behind the revolving line-up and the regular sidemen, the true core of the Project was the duo of Parsons and Woolfson.  Parsons was an audio engineer and producer by profession, but also a musician and a composer. 

Almost all<====>1309<====>Almost all In mathematics, the phrase "almost all" has a number of specialised uses which extend its intuitive meaning. CardinalityReferring to a subset of an infinite set, "almost all" is sometimes used synonymously with "all but [except] finitely many" (that is, it is a cofinite subset).  A simple example is that almost all prime numbers are odd, which is based on the fact that all but one prime number are odd.  (The exception is the number 2, which is prime but not odd. )Referring to a subset of an uncountable set, "almost all" is sometimes used to mean "all the elements except for a countable set" (that is, it is a cocountable subset). 

Aromatic hydrocarbon<====>1313<====>Aromatic hydrocarbon An aromatic hydrocarbon or arene  (or sometimes aryl hydrocarbon)  is a hydrocarbon with sigma bonds and delocalized pi electrons between carbon atoms forming a circle.  In contrast, aliphatic hydrocarbons lack this delocalization.  The term 'aromatic' was assigned before the physical mechanism determining aromaticity was discovered; the term was coined as such simply because many of the compounds have a sweet or pleasant odour.  The configuration of six carbon atoms in aromatic compounds is known as a benzene ring, after the simplest possible such hydrocarbon, benzene.  Aromatic hydrocarbons can be monocyclic (MAH) or polycyclic (PAH). 

Abbey<====>1315<====>Abbey  An abbey is a complex of buildings used by members of a religious order under the governance of an abbot or abbess.  It provides a place for religious activities, work and housing of Christian monks and nuns.  The concept of the abbey has developed over many centuries from the early monastic ways of religious men and women where they would live isolated from the lay community about them.  Religious life in an abbey may be monastic.  An abbey may be the home of an enclosed religious order or may be open to visitors.  The layout of the church and associated buildings of an abbey often follows a set plan determined by the founding religious order. 

Annales school<====>1316<====>Annales school DISPLAYTITLEThe Annales school ( ) is a group of historians associated with a style of historiography developed by French historians in the 20th century to stress long-term social history.  It is named after its scholarly journal Annales d'histoire économique et sociale, which remains the main source of scholarship, along with many books and monographs.   The school has been highly influential in setting the agenda for historiography in France and numerous other countries, especially regarding the use of social scientific methods by historians, emphasizing social rather than political or diplomatic themes, and for being generally hostile to the class analysis of Marxist historiography. 

Antimatter<====>1317<====>Antimatter   In modern physics, antimatter is defined as a material composed of the antiparticle (or "partners") to the corresponding particles of ordinary matter. In theory, a particle and its anti-particle have the same mass as one another, but opposite electric charge, and other differences in quantum numbers.  For example, a proton has positive charge while an antiproton has negative charge.  A collision between any particle and its anti-particle partner is known to lead to their mutual annihilation, giving rise to various proportions of intense photons (gamma rays), neutrinos, and sometimes less-massive particle–antiparticle pairs. Annihilation usually results in a release of energy that becomes available for heat or work. 

Casa Batlló<====>1322<====>Casa Batlló Casa Batlló ( ) is a renowned building located in the center of Barcelona and is one of Antoni Gaudí’s masterpieces.  A remodel of a previously built house, it was redesigned in 1904 by Gaudí and has been refurbished several times after that.  Gaudí's assistants Domènec Sugrañes i Gras, Josep Canaleta and Joan Rubió also contributed to the renovation project.  The local name for the building is Casa dels ossos (House of Bones), as it has a visceral, skeletal organic quality. Like everything Gaudí designed, it is only identifiable as Modernisme or Art Nouveau in the broadest sense. 

Park Güell<====>1324<====>Park Güell The Park Güell (   ) is a public park system composed of gardens and architectonic elements located on Carmel Hill, in Barcelona, Catalonia (Spain).  Carmel Hill belongs to the mountain range of Collserola – the Parc del Carmel is located on the northern face.  Park Güell is located in La Salut, a neighborhood in the Gràcia district of Barcelona.  With urbanization in mind, Eusebi Güell assigned the design of the park to Antoni Gaudí, a renowned architect and the face of Catalan modernism.  The park was built between 1900 and 1914 and was officially opened as a public park in 1926. 

Casa Milà<====>1325<====>Casa Milà   Casa Milà ( ,  ), popularly known as La Pedrera or "open quarry", a reference to its unconventional rough-hewn appearance, is a modernist building in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.  It was the last private residence designed by architect Antoni Gaudí and was built between 1906 and 1912. The building was commissioned in 1906 by   and his wife  .  At the time, it was controversial because of its undulating stone facade, twisting wrought iron balconies and designed by Josep Maria Jujol.  Several structural innovations include a self-supporting stone façade, and an free-plan floor, underground garage and the spectacular on the roof-terrace. 

Antiparticle<====>1327<====>Antiparticle In particle physics, every type of particle has an associated antiparticle with the same mass but with opposite physical charges (such as electric charge).  For example, the antiparticle of the electron is the antielectron (which is often referred to as positron).  While the electron has a negative electric charge, the positron has a positive electric charge, and is produced naturally in certain types of radioactive decay.   The opposite is also true: the antiparticle of the positron is the electron. Some particles, such as the photon, are their own antiparticle.  Otherwise, for each pair of antiparticle partners, one is designated as normal matter (the kind we are made of), and the other (usually given the prefix "anti-") as antimatter. 

Arabian Prince<====>1331<====>Arabian Prince Kim Renard Nazel (born June 17, 1965),  better known by his stage name Arabian Prince, is an American rapper, singer-songwriter, record producer, and DJ.  Early lifeNazel was born in Compton, California to the son of Joseph "Skippy" Nazel Jr. , a prominent African American author and radio talk show host. His musical background came from his mother, a piano teacher and classical musician.    The younger Nazel got his first experience with making music at the radio station his father was hosting his talk show by using the station's equipment to put together mixtapes that he would sell at school.

AD 73 – Masada, a Jewish fortress, falls to the Romans after several months of siege, ending the Great Jewish Revolt. 1346 – Dušan the Mighty is proclaimed Emperor, with the Serbian Empire occupying much of the Balkans. 1520 – The Revolt of the Comuneros begins in Spain against the rule of Charles V. 1582 – Spanish conquistador Hernando de Lerma founds the settlement of Salta, Argentina. 

Associative property<====>1335<====>Associative property    In mathematics, the associative property    is a property of some binary operations.  In propositional logic, associativity is a valid rule of replacement for expressions in logical proofs. Within an expression containing two or more occurrences in a row of the same associative operator, the order in which the operations are performed does not matter as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed.  That is, rearranging the parentheses in such an expression will not change its value.  Consider the following equations: (2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4) = 9 \,  2 \times (3 \times 4) = (2 \times 3) \times 4 = 24 . 

Apache Software Foundation<====>1336<====>Apache Software Foundation The Apache Software Foundation   (ASF) is an American non-profit corporation (classified as 501(c)(3) in the United States) to support Apache software projects, including the Apache HTTP Server.  The ASF was formed from the Apache Group and incorporated in Delaware, U. S. , in June 1999.  The Apache Software Foundation is a decentralized open source community of developers.  The software they produce is distributed under the terms of the Apache License and is free and open-source software (FOSS).  The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus-based development process and an open and pragmatic software license. 

Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990<====>1338<====>Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ( ) is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability.  It affords similar protections against discrimination to Americans with disabilities as the Civil Rights Act of 1964,  which made discrimination based on race, religion, sex, national origin, and other characteristics illegal.  In addition, unlike the Civil Rights  Act, the ADA also requires covered employers to provide reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities, and imposes accessibility requirements on public accommodations.  In 1986, the National Council on Disability had recommended enactment of an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and drafted the first version of the bill which was introduced in the House and Senate in 1988. 

Apple I<====>1344<====>Apple I  Apple Computer 1, also known later as the Apple I, or Apple-1, is a desktop computer released by the Apple Computer Company (now Apple Inc. ) in 1976.  It was designed and hand-built by Steve Wozniak.    Wozniak's friend Steve Jobs had the idea of selling the computer.  The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation, a VW Microbus,  for a few hundred dollars, and Steve Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for $500; however, Wozniak said that Jobs planned to use his bicycle if necessary. 

Apatosaurus<====>1346<====>Apatosaurus  Apatosaurus ( ;   meaning "deceptive lizard") is a genus of extinct sauropod dinosaurs that lived in North America during the Late Jurassic period.  Othniel Charles Marsh described and named the first-known species, A.  ajax, in 1877, and a second species, A.  louisae, was discovered and named by William H.  Holland in 1916.  Apatosaurus lived about 152 to 151 million years ago (mya), during the early Tithonian age, and are now known from fossils in the Morrison Formation of modern-day Colorado, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Utah in the United States.  Apatosaurus had an average length of  , and an average mass of  . 

Allosaurus<====>1347<====>Allosaurus    Allosaurus (   ) is a genus of large theropod dinosaur that lived 155 to 150 million years ago during the late Jurassic period (Kimmeridgian to early Tithonian Turner, C. E.  and Peterson, F. , (1999).  "Biostratigraphy of dinosaurs in the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of the Western Interior, U. S. A. " Pp.  77–114 in Gillette, D. D.  (ed. ), Vertebrate Paleontology in Utah.  Utah Geological Survey Miscellaneous Publication 99-1.  ).  The name "Allosaurus" means "different lizard".  It is derived from the Greek  /allos ("different, other") and  /sauros ("lizard / generic reptile"). 

AK-47<====>1348<====>AK-47   The AK-47, or AK as it is officially known ( ), also known as the Kalashnikov, is a gas-operated, 7. 62×39mm assault rifle, developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov.  It is the originating firearm of the Kalashnikov rifle (or "AK") family. Design work on the AK-47 began in 1945.  In 1946, the AK-47 was presented for official military trials, and in 1948, the fixed-stock version was introduced into active service with selected units of the Soviet Army.  An early development of the design was the AKS (S—Skladnoy or "folding"), which was equipped with an underfolding metal shoulder stock. 

Atanasoff–Berry computer<====>1349<====>Atanasoff–Berry computerThe Atanasoff–Berry Computer (ABC) was the first automatic electronic digital computer, an early electronic digital computing device that has remained somewhat obscure.  The ABC's priority is debated among historians of computer technology, because it was neither programmable, nor Turing-complete.  Conceived in 1937, the machine was built by Iowa State College mathematics and physics professor John Vincent Atanasoff with the help of graduate student Clifford Berry.  It was designed only to solve systems of linear equations and was successfully tested in 1942.  However, its intermediate result storage mechanism, a paper card writer/reader, was not perfected, and when John Vincent Atanasoff left Iowa State College for World War II assignments, work on the machine was discontinued. 

Andes<====>1354<====>Andes  The Andes or Andean Mountains ( ) are the longest continental mountain range in the world.  They form a continuous highland along the western edge of South America.  This range is about   long, about   wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about  .  The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. Along their length, the Andes are split into several ranges, which are separated by intermediate depressions.  The Andes are the location of several high plateaus – some of which host major cities such as Quito, Bogotá, Arequipa, Medellín, Sucre, Mérida and La Paz. 

Ancylopoda<====>1356<====>Ancylopoda Ancylopoda is a group of browsing, herbivorous, mammals in the Perissodactyla that show long, curved and cleft claws.  Morphological evidence indicates the Ancylopoda diverged from the tapirs, rhinoceroses and horses (Euperissodactyla) after the Brontotheria, however earlier authorities such as Osborn sometimes considered the Ancylopoda to be outside Perissodactyla or, as was popular more recently,  to be related to Brontotheria.References  

Anchor<====>1358<====>Anchor   An anchor is a device, normally made of metal, used to connect a vessel to the bed of a body of water to prevent the craft from drifting due to wind or current.  The word derives from Latin ancora, which itself comes from the Greek ἄγκυρα (ankura).   Anchors can either be temporary or permanent.  Permanent anchors are used in the creation of a mooring, and are rarely moved; a specialist service is normally needed to move or maintain them.  Vessels carry one or more temporary anchors, which may be of different designs and weights. 

Anbar (town)<====>1359<====>Anbar (town)    Anbar ( ) was a town in Iraq, at lat.  33 deg.   22' N. , long.  43 deg.   49' E, on the east bank of the Euphrates, just south of the Nahr 'Isa, or Sakhlawieh canal, the northernmost of the canals connecting that river with the Tigris.  HistoryAnbar was originally called Pērōz-Šāpūr or Pērōz-Šābuhr (from  , meaning "Victorious Shapur"; in   prgwzšhypwhr; in  ), and became known as Perisapora or Pirisabora to the Greeks and Romans.  The city was founded   by the Sasanian Persian king Shapur II, and located in the Sassanid province of Asōristān. 

Anazarbus<====>1360<====>Anazarbus  Anazarbus  ( , medieval Ain Zarba; modern Anavarza;  ) was an ancient Cilician city and (arch)bishopric,  which remains a Latin Catholic titular see.  LocationIt was situated in Anatolia in modern Turkey, in the present Çukurova (or classical Aleian plain) about 15 km west of the main stream of the present Ceyhan River (or classical Pyramus river) and near its tributary the Sempas Su. A lofty isolated ridge formed its acropolis.  Though some of the masonry in the ruins is certainly pre-Roman, the Suda's identification of it with Cyinda, famous as a treasure city in the wars of Eumenes of Cardia, cannot be accepted in the face of Strabo's express location of Cyinda in western Cilicia. 

Anagram<====>1361<====>Anagram  An anagram is word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.   For example, the word anagram can be rearranged into "nag a ram". The original word or phrase is known as the subject of the anagram.  Any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram.  Someone who creates anagrams may be called an "anagrammatist",  and the goal of a serious or skilled anagrammatist is to produce anagrams that reflect or comment on their subject. 

Anadyr River<====>1362<====>Anadyr River  Anadyr ( ) is a river in the far northeast Siberia which flows into Anadyr Bay of the Bering Sea and drains much of the interior of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug.  Its basin corresponds to the Anadyrsky District of Chukotka. GeographyThe Anadyr is   long and has a basin of  .  It is frozen from October to late May and has a maximum flow in June with the snowmelt.   It is navigable in small boats for about   to near Markovo.  West of Markovo it is in the Anadyr Highlands (moderate mountains and valleys with a few trees) and east of Markovo it moves into the Anadyr lowlands (very flat treeless tundra with lakes and bogs). 

André-Marie Ampère<====>1363<====>André-Marie Ampère  André-Marie Ampère ( ;   ; 20 January 1775 10 June 1836)  was a French physicist and mathematician who was one of the founders of the science of classical electromagnetism, which he referred to as "electrodynamics".  He is also the inventor of numerous applications, such as the solenoid (a term coined by him) and the electrical telegraph.  An autodidact, Ampère was a member of the Académie des sciences and professor at the École polytechnique and the Collège de France. The SI unit of measurement of electric current, the ampere, is named after him. 

Ammonia<====>1365<====>AmmoniaAmmonia or azane is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen with the formula NH 3 .  The simplest pnictogen hydride, ammonia is a colourless gas with a characteristic pungent smell.  It is a common nitrogenous waste, particularly among aquatic organisms, and it contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to food and fertilizers.  Ammonia, either directly or indirectly, is also a building block for the synthesis of many pharmaceutical products and is used in many commercial cleaning products. Although common in nature and in wide use, ammonia is both caustic and hazardous in its concentrated form. 

Amethyst<====>1366<====>Amethyst  Amethyst is a violet variety of quartz often used in jewelry.  The name comes from the Koine Greek ἀμέθυστος amethystos from ἀ- a-, "not" and μεθύσκω methysko / μεθύω methyo, "intoxicate", a reference to the belief that the stone protected its owner from drunkenness.The ancient Greeks wore amethyst and carved drinking vessels from it in the belief that it would prevent intoxication.  It is one of several forms of quartz.  Amethyst is a semiprecious stone and is the traditional birthstone for February. StructureAmethyst is a purple variety of quartz (SiO 2 ) and owes its violet color to irradiation, iron impurities (in some cases in conjunction with transition element impurities), and the presence of trace elements, which result in complex crystal lattice substitutions. 

Albertosaurus<====>1367<====>Albertosaurus  Albertosaurus ( ; meaning "Alberta lizard") is a genus of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaurs that lived in western North America during the Late Cretaceous Period, about 70 million years ago.  The type species, A.  sarcophagus, was apparently restricted in range to the modern-day Canadian province of Alberta, after which the genus is named.  Scientists disagree on the content of the genus, with some recognizing Gorgosaurus libratus as a second species. As a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a bipedal predator with tiny, two-fingered hands and a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth.  It may have been at the top of the food chain in its local ecosystem. 

Assembly language<====>1368<====>Assembly language An assembly (or assembler) language,  often abbreviated asm, is a low-level programming language for a computer, or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong (but often not one-to-one) correspondence between the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.   Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture.  In contrast, most high-level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling.  Assembly language may also be called symbolic machine code.  Assembly language is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an assembler. 

Ambrosia<====>1369<====>Ambrosia In the ancient Greek myths, ambrosia ( ,  ) is sometimes the food or drink of the Greek gods, often depicted as conferring longevity or immortality upon whoever consumed it.It was brought to the gods in Olympus by doves.  Ambrosia is sometimes depicted in ancient art as distributed by a nymph labeled with that name.   In the myth of Lycurgus, an opponent to the wine god Dionysus, violence committed against Ambrosia turns her into a grapevine. Definition Ambrosia is very closely related to the gods' other form of sustenance, nectar. 

Ambrose<====>1370<====>Ambrose    Aurelius Ambrosius  ( –397), better known in English as Ambrose ( ), was a bishop of Milan who became one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the 4th century.  He was the Roman governor of Liguria and Emilia, headquartered in Milan, before being made bishop of Milan by popular acclamation in 374.  Ambrose was a staunch opponent of Arianism, and has been accused of fostering persecutions {citation needed} of Arians, Jews, and pagans. Traditionally, Ambrose is credited with promoting "antiphonal chant", a style of chanting in which one side of the choir responds alternately to the other, as well as with composing Veni redemptor gentium, an Advent hymn. 

Ambracia<====>1371<====>Ambracia Ambracia ( ;  , occasionally  , Ampracia), was a city of ancient Greece on the site of modern Arta.  It was captured by the Corinthians in the 625 BC and was situated about 7 miles from the Ambracian Gulf, on a bend of the navigable river Arachthos (or Aratthus), in the midst of a fertile wooded plain.    HistoryIt was founded between 650 and 625 BC by Gorgus, son of the Corinthian tyrant Cypselus, at which time its economy was based on farmlands, fishing, timber for shipbuilding, and the exportation of the produce of Epirus. 

Amber<====>1372<====>Amber    Amber is fossilized tree resin, which has been appreciated for its color and natural beauty since Neolithic times.   Much valued from antiquity to the present as a gemstone, amber is made into a variety of decorative objects.  "Amber" (2004).  In Maxine N.  Lurie and Marc Mappen (eds. ) Encyclopedia of New Jersey, Rutgers University Press,  .   Amber is used in jewelry.  It has also been used as a healing agent in folk medicine. There are five classes of amber, defined on the basis of their chemical constituents. 

Amalaric<====>1373<====>Amalaric Amalaric (Gothic: Amalareiks), or in Spanish and Portuguese, Amalarico, (502–531) was king of the Visigoths from 511 until his death in battle in 531.  He was a son of king Alaric II and his first wife Theodegotha, daughter of Theoderic the Great King of the Ostrogoths. When Alaric II was killed fighting Clovis I, king of the Franks, in the Battle of Vouillé (507), his kingdom fell into disarray.  "More serious than the destruction of the Gothic army," writes Herwig Wolfram, "than the loss of both Aquitanian provinces and the capital of Toulose, was the death of the king. 

Alphorn<====>1374<====>Alphorn  The alphorn or alpenhorn or alpine horn is a labrophone, consisting of a wooden natural horn of conical bore, having a wooden cup-shaped mouthpiece, used by mountain dwellers in the Swiss Alps, Austrian Alps, Bavarian Alps in Germany, French Alps, and elsewhere.  Similar wooden horns were used for communication in most mountainous regions of Europe, from the Alps to the Carpathians. For a long time, scholars believed that the alphorn had been derived from the Roman-Etruscan lituus, because of their resemblance in shape, and because of the word liti, meaning Alphorn in the dialect of Obwalden.   There is no documented evidence for this theory, however, and, the word liti was probably borrowed from 16th–18th century writings in Latin, where the word lituus could describe various wind instruments, such as the horn, the crumhorn, or the cornett. 

Army<====>1376<====>Army An army (from Latin arma "arms, weapons" via Old French armée, "armed" (feminine)) or ground force is a fighting force that fights primarily on land.  In the broadest sense, it is the land-based military branch, service branch or armed service of a nation or state.  It may also include other branches of the military such as the air force via means of army aviation.  In certain nations, the term army refers to the entire armed forces of a nation (e. g. , People's Liberation Army).  Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a field army. 

Alligatoridae<====>1380<====>Alligatoridae The family Alligatoridae of crocodylians includes alligators and caimans. True alligatorsThe lineage including alligators proper (Alligatorinae) occurs in the fluvial deposits of the age of the Upper Chalk in Europe, where they did not die out until the Pliocene age.  The true alligators are today represented by two species, A.  mississippiensis in the southeastern United States, which can grow to 15 ft (4. 6 m) and weigh 1000 lbs (453 kg)  and the small A.  sinensis in the Yangtze River, China, which grows to an average of 5 ft (1. 5 m).  Their name derives from the Spanish el lagarto, which means "the lizard". 

Alder<====>1383<====>Alder    Alder is the common name of a genus of flowering plants (Alnus) belonging to the birch family Betulaceae.  The genus comprises about 35  species of monoecious trees and shrubs, a few reaching a large size, distributed throughout the north temperate zone with a few species extending into Central America, as well as the northern and southern Andes.  Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families EtymologyThe common name alder evolved from Old English alor, which in turn is derived from Proto-Germanic root  aliso.  The generic name Alnus is the equivalent Latin name. 

Amos Bronson Alcott<====>1384<====>Amos Bronson Alcott Amos Bronson Alcott ( ; November 29, 1799 March 4, 1888) was an American teacher, writer, philosopher, and reformer.  As an educator, Alcott pioneered new ways of interacting with young students, focusing on a conversational style, and avoided traditional punishment.  He hoped to perfect the human spirit and, to that end, advocated a vegan diet before the term was coined.  He was also an abolitionist and an advocate for women's rights. Born in Connecticut in  1799, Alcott had only minimal formal schooling before attempting a career as a traveling salesman.  Worried about how the itinerant life might have a negative impact on his soul, he turned to teaching. 

Arachnophobia<====>1386<====>Arachnophobia  Arachnophobia is the irrational fear of spiders and other arachnids such as scorpions.  Signs and symptomsPeople with arachnophobia tend to feel uneasy in any area they believe could harbor spiders or that has visible signs of their presence, such as webs.  If arachnophobics see a spider, they may not enter the general vicinity until they have overcome the panic attack that is often associated with their phobia.  Some people scream, cry, have emotional outbursts, experience trouble breathing, sweat, have heart palpitations, or even faint when they come in contact with an area near spiders or their webs. 

Alabaster<====>1387<====>Alabaster Alabaster is a mineral or rock that is soft, often used for carving, and is processed for plaster powder.  Archaeologists and the stone processing industry use the word differently than geologists.  The former use is in a wider sense that includes varieties of two different minerals: the fine-grained massive type of gypsum  and the fine-grained banded type of calcite.  More about alabaster and travertine, brief guide explaining the different use of these words by geologists, archaeologists, and those in the stone trade.  Oxford University Museum of Natural History, 2012, [1]  Geologists define alabaster only as the gypsum type. 

Ahab<====>1389<====>Ahab  Ahab ( ;  ;  ;  ) was the seventh king of Israel since Jeroboam I, the son and successor of Omri, and the husband of Jezebel of Sidon, according to the Hebrew Scriptures.   The Hebrew Bible presents Ahab as a wicked king.  He is criticised for following the ways of his wife Jezebel, killing his subject Naboth, and leading the nation of Israel into idolatry. The existence of Ahab is historically supported outside the Bible.  Shalmaneser III documented 853 BC that he defeated an alliance of a dozen kings in the Battle of Qarqar; one of these was Ahab. 

Dasyproctidae<====>1392<====>Dasyproctidae Dasyproctidae is a family of large South American rodents, comprising the agoutis and acouchis.Their fur is a reddish or dark colour above, with a paler underside.  They are herbivorous, often feeding on ripe fruit that falls from trees.  They live in burrows, and, like squirrels, will bury some of their food for later use.    Dasyproctids exist in Central and South America, which are the tropical parts of the new world.  The fossil record of this family can be traced back to the Oligocene period (34-23 million years ago). 

Algol<====>1394<====>Algol    Algol, designated Beta Persei (β Persei, abbreviated Beta Per, β Per), known colloquially as the Demon Star, is a bright multiple star in the constellation of Perseus.  It is the first and best known eclipsing binary, and one of the first non-nova variable stars to be discovered.  It is a three-star system, consisting of Beta Persei Aa1, Aa2, and Ab - in which the large and bright primary β Persei Aa1 is regularly eclipsed by the dimmer β Persei Aa2.  Thus, Algol's magnitude is usually near-constant at 2. 

Amazing Grace<====>1395<====>Amazing Grace  "Amazing Grace" is a Christian hymn published in 1779, with words written by the English poet and Anglican clergyman John Newton (1725–1807). Newton wrote the words from personal experience.  He grew up without any particular religious conviction, but his life's path was formed by a variety of twists and coincidences that were often put into motion by his recalcitrant insubordination.  He was pressed (conscripted) into service in the Royal Navy, and after leaving the service, he became involved in the Atlantic slave trade.  In 1748, a violent storm battered his vessel off the coast of County Donegal, Ireland, so severely that he called out to God for mercy, a moment that marked his spiritual conversion. 

AOL<====>1397<====>AOL   AOL (formerly a company known as AOL Inc. , originally known as America Online, and stylized as Aol. ) is a web portal and online service provider based in New York.  It is a brand marketed by Oath, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications.  AOL was one of the early pioneers of the Internet in the mid-1990s, and the most recognized brand on the web in the United States.  It originally provided a dial-up service to millions of Americans, as well as providing a web portal, e-mail, instant messaging and later a web browser following its purchase of Netscape. 

Anno Domini<====>1400<====>Anno Domini  The terms (AD) and before Christ(BC) are used to label or number years in the Julian and Gregorian calendars.  The term   is Medieval Latin and means "in the year of the Lord",  but is often presented using "our Lord" instead of "the Lord",   taken from the full original phrase "anno Domini nostri Jesu Christi", which translates to "in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ". This calendar era is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the conception or birth of Jesus of Nazareth, with AD counting years from the start of this epoch, and BC denoting years before the start of the era. 

Alcuin<====>1408<====>AlcuinAlcuin of York ( ;   ;   735 – 19 May 804 AD)—also called Ealhwine, Alhwin or Alchoin—was an English scholar, clergyman, poet and teacher from York, Northumbria.  He was born around 735 and became the student of Archbishop Ecgbert at York.  At the invitation of Charlemagne, he became a leading scholar and teacher at the Carolingian court, where he remained a figure in the 780s and '90s. Alcuin wrote many theological and dogmatic treatises, as well as a few grammatical works and a number of poems.  He was made Abbot of Tours in 796, where he remained until his death. 

Angilbert<====>1409<====>Angilbert  Saint Angilbert (  – 18 February 814), sometimes known as Angilberk or Engelbert, was a noble Frankish poet who was educated under Alcuin and served Charlemagne as a secretary, diplomat, and son-in-law.  He was venerated as a pre-Congregation saint and is still honored on the day of his death, 18 February. LifeAngilbert seems to have been brought up at the court of Charlemagne at the palace school in Aquae Grani (Aachen).  He was educated there as the pupil and then friend of the great English scholar Alcuin.  When Charlemagne sent his young son Pepin to Italy as King of the Lombards Angilbert went along as primicerius palatii, a high administrator of the satellite court. 

Amine<====>1412<====>Amine  Primary amine  Secondary amine  Tertiary amine    In organic chemistry, amines ( ,   )   are compounds and functional groups that contain a basic nitrogen atom with a lone pair.  Amines are formally derivatives of ammonia, wherein one or more hydrogen atoms have been replaced by a substituent such as an alkyl or aryl group  (these may respectively be called alkylamines and arylamines; amines in which both types of substituent are attached to one nitrogen atom may be called alkylarylamines).  Important amines include amino acids, biogenic amines, trimethylamine, and aniline; see Category:Amines for a list of amines. 

April 29<====>1416<====>April 29Events1091 – Battle of Levounion: The Pechenegs are defeated by Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. 1386 – Battle of the Vikhra River: The Principality of Smolensk is defeated by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and becomes its vassal. 1429 – Joan of Arc arrives to relieve the Siege of Orléans. 1483 – Gran Canaria, the main island of the Canary Islands, is conquered by the Kingdom of Castile. 1521 – Swedish War of Liberation: Swedish troops defeat a Danish force in the Battle of Västerås. 1770 – James Cook arrives in Australia at Botany Bay, which he names. 

August 14<====>1417<====>August 14Events29 BC – Octavian holds the second of three consecutive triumphs in Rome to celebrate the victory over the Dalmatian tribes. 1040 – King Duncan I is killed in battle against his first cousin and rival Macbeth.  The latter succeeds him as King of Scotland. 1183 – Taira no Munemori and the Taira clan take the young Emperor Antoku and the three sacred treasures and flee to western Japan to escape pursuit by the Minamoto clan (traditional Japanese date: Twenty-fifth Day of the Seventh Month of the Second Year of Juei). 1288 – Count Adolf VIII of Berg grants town privileges to Düsseldorf, the village on the banks of the Düssel. 

Absolute zero<====>1418<====>Absolute zero Absolute zero is the lower limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale, a state at which the enthalpy and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reaches its minimum value, taken as 0.  Absolute zero is the point at which the fundamental particles of nature have minimal vibrational motion, retaining only quantum mechanical, zero-point energy-induced particle motion.   The theoretical temperature is determined by extrapolating the ideal gas law; by international agreement, absolute zero is taken as −273. 15° on the Celsius scale (International System of Units),   Note: The triple point of water is 0. 01 °C, not 0 °C; thus 0 K is −273. 

Adiabatic process<====>1419<====>Adiabatic process  In thermodynamics, an adiabatic process is one that occurs without transfer of heat or matter between a thermodynamic system and its surroundings.  In an adiabatic process, energy is transferred to its surroundings only as work.   .  A translation may be found here.   Also a mostly reliable translation is to be found in  The adiabatic process provides a rigorous conceptual basis for the theory used to expound the first law of thermodynamics, and as such it is a key concept in thermodynamics. Some chemical and physical processes occur so rapidly that they may be conveniently described by the term "adiabatic approximation", meaning that there is not enough time for the transfer of energy as heat to take place to or from the system. 

Amide<====>1422<====>Amide  An amide (  or   or  ),    also known as an acid amide, is a compound with the functional group R n E(O) x NR′ 2  (R and R′ refer to H or organic groups).  Most common are carboxamides (organic amides) (n = 1, E = C, x = 1), but many other important types of amides are known, including phosphoramides (n = 2, E = P, x = 1 and many related formulas) and sulfonamides (E = S, x = 2).   The term amide refers both to classes of compounds and to the functional group (R n E(O) x NR′ 2 ) within those compounds. 

Animism<====>1423<====>Animism  Animism (from Latin  , "breath, spirit, life")   is the religious belief that objects, places and creatures all possess a distinct spiritual essence.   Potentially, animism perceives all things—animals, plants, rocks, rivers, weather systems, human handiwork and perhaps even words—as animated and alive.  Animism is used in the anthropology of religion as a term for the belief system of many indigenous peoples,  especially in contrast to the relatively more recent development of organised religions.   Although each culture has its own different mythologies and rituals, "animism" is said to describe the most common, foundational thread of indigenous peoples' "spiritual" or "supernatural" perspectives. 

Antonio Vivaldi<====>1425<====>Antonio Vivaldi   Antonio Lucio Vivaldi ( ; 4 March 1678 – 28 July 1741) was an Italian    Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher and cleric.  Born in Venice, he is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque composers, and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe.  He composed many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than forty operas.  His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as The Four Seasons. Many of his compositions were written for the all-female music ensemble of the Ospedale della Pietà, a home for abandoned children where Vivaldi (who had been ordained as a Catholic priest) was employed from 1703 to 1715 and from 1723 to 1740. 

Adrian<====>1428<====>Adrian  Adrian is a form of the Latin given name Adrianus or Hadrianus.  Its ultimate origin is most likely via the former river Adria from the Venetic and Illyrian word adur, meaning 'sea' or 'water'.    The Adria was until the 8th century BC the main channel of the Po River into the Adriatic Sea but ceased to exist before the 1st century BC.  Hecataeus of Miletus (c. 550 - c. 476 BC) asserted that both the Etruscan harbor city of Adria and the Adriatic Sea had been named after it.   Emperor Hadrian's family was named after the city or region of Adria/Hadria, now Atri, in Picenum, which most likely started as an Etruscan or Greek colony of the older harbor city of the same name. 

Aare<====>1433<====>Aare  The Aare ( ) or Aar is a tributary of the High Rhine and the longest river that both rises and ends entirely within Switzerland.Its total length from its source to its junction with the Rhine comprises about  ,   during which distance it descends  , draining an area of  , almost entirely within Switzerland, and accounting for close to half the area of the country, including all of Central Switzerland.    There are more than 40 hydroelectric plants along the course of the Aare River.  The river's name dates to at least the La Tène period, and it is attested as Nantaror "Aare valley" in the Berne zinc tablet. 

Abbotsford House<====>1435<====>Abbotsford House   Abbotsford is a historic country house in the Scottish Borders, near Melrose, on the south bank of the River Tweed.  It was formerly the residence of historical novelist and poet, Sir Walter Scott.   It is a Category A Listed Building.  DescriptionThe nucleus of the estate was a small farm of  , called Cartleyhole, nicknamed Clarty (i. e. , muddy) Hole, and was bought by Scott on the lapse of his lease (1811) of the neighbouring house of Ashestiel.    He first built a small villa and named it Abbotsford, creating the name from a ford nearby where previously abbots of Melrose Abbey used to cross the river. 

Abraham<====>1436<====>Abraham  Abraham ( , Arabic: إبراهيم Ibrahim), originally Avram or Abram ( ), is the common patriarch of the three Abrahamic religions.  In Judaism he is the founding father of the Covenant, the special relationship between the Jewish people and God; in Christianity, he is the prototype of all believers, Jewish or Gentile; and in Islam he is seen as a link in the chain of prophets that begins with Adam and culminates in Muhammad.  The narrative in Genesis revolves around the themes of posterity and land.  Abraham is called by God to leave the house of his father Terah and settle in the land originally given to Canaan, but which God now promises to Abraham and his progeny.

The word is found in Gnostic texts such as the Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit, and also appears in the Greek Magical Papyri.  It was engraved on certain antique gemstones, called on that account Abraxas stones, which were used as amulets or charms.As the initial spelling on stones was 'Abrasax' (Αβρασαξ), the spelling of  'Abraxas' seen today probably originates in the confusion made between the Greek letters Sigma and Xi in the Latin transliteration.

APL (programming language)<====>1451<====>APL (programming language)    APL (named after the book A Programming Language)    is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E.  Iverson.  Its central datatype is the multidimensional array.  It uses a large range of special graphic symbols  to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code.  It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming,  and computer math packages.   It has also inspired several other programming languages.It is still used today for certain applications. 

ALGOL<====>1453<====>ALGOL   ALGOL (short for Algorithmic Language)  is a family of imperative computer programming languages, originally developed in the mid-1950s, which greatly influenced many other languages and was the standard method for algorithm description used by the ACM in textbooks and academic sources for more than thirty years.  In the sense that the syntax of most modern languages is "Algol-like",  it was arguably the most influential of the four high-level programming languages among which it was roughly contemporary: FORTRAN, Lisp, and COBOL.   It was designed to avoid some of the perceived problems with FORTRAN and eventually gave rise to many other programming languages, including PL/I, Simula, BCPL, B, Pascal, and C. 

AWK<====>1456<====>AWK  AWK is a programming language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool.  It is a standard feature of most Unix-like operating systems. The AWK language is a data-driven scripting language consisting of a set of actions to be taken against streams of textual data – either run directly on files or used as part of a pipeline – for purposes of extracting or transforming text, such as producing formatted reports.  The language extensively uses the string datatype, associative arrays (that is, arrays indexed by key strings), and regular expressions. 

Asgard<====>1460<====>Asgard In Norse religion, Asgard ( ; "Enclosure of the Æsir"   ) is one of the Nine Worlds and home to the Æsir tribe of gods.  It is surrounded by an incomplete wall attributed to a Hrimthurs riding the stallion Svaðilfari, according to Gylfaginning.  Odin and his wife, Frigg, are the rulers of Asgard. One of Asgard's well known realms is Valhalla, in which Odin rules.  AttestationsThe primary sources regarding Asgard come from the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson, and the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from a basis of much older Skaldic poetry. 

Apollo program<====>1461<====>Apollo program   The Apollo program, also known as Project Apollo, was the third United States human spaceflight program carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which accomplished landing the first humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972.  First conceived during Dwight D.  Eisenhower's administration as a three-man spacecraft to follow the one-man Project Mercury which put the first Americans in space, Apollo was later dedicated to President John F.  Kennedy's national goal of "landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth" by the end of the 1960s, which he proposed in an address to Congress on May 25, 1961. 

Assault<====>1466<====>Assault    In criminal and civil law, assault is a threat of imminent harmful or offensive contact with a person, or a threat to do so.    It is distinct from battery, which refers to the actual achievement of such contact. An assault is carried out by a threat of bodily harm coupled with an apparent, present ability to cause the harm.  It is both a crime and a tort and, therefore, may result in either criminal and/or civil liability.  Generally, the common law definition is the same in criminal and tort law.  There is, however, an additional criminal law category of assault consisting of an attempted but unsuccessful battery. 

Álfheimr<====>1478<====>Álfheimr Alfheim ( , "Land Of The Elves" or "Elfland"), also called Ljosalfheim (Ljósálf[a]heimr, "home of the light-elves"), is one of the Nine Worlds and home of the Light Elves in Norse mythology. In Old Norse texts Álfheim as an abode of the Elves is mentioned only twice in Old Norse texts. The eddic poem Grímnismál describes twelve divine dwellings beginning in stanza 5 with: Ýdalir call they     the place where Ull A hall for himself hath set; And Álfheim the gods     to Frey once gave As a tooth-gift in ancient times.  A tooth-gift was a gift given to an infant on the cutting of the first tooth. 

Ask and Embla<====>1482<====>Ask and Embla In Norse mythology, Ask and Embla (from Old Norse Askr ok Embla)—male and female respectively—were the first two humans, created by the gods.  The pair are attested in both the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson.  In both sources, three gods, one of whom is Odin, find Ask and Embla and bestow upon them various corporeal and spiritual gifts.  A number of theories have been proposed to explain the two figures, and there are occasional references to them in popular culture.

Alain de Lille<====>1485<====>Alain de LilleAlain de Lille (or Alanus ab Insulis) (  1128 1202/03) was a French theologian and poet.  He was born in Lille, some time before 1128.  His exact date of death remains unclear as well, with most research pointing toward it being between April 14, 1202, and April 5, 1203.  LifeLittle is known of his life, however it is clear that Alan entered the schools no earlier than the late 1140s; first attending the school at Paris, and then at Chartres.  He probably studied under masters such as Peter Abelard, Gilbert of Poitiers, and Thierry of Chartres. 

Alemanni<====>1486<====>Alemanni The Alemanni (also Alamanni;  Suebi "Swabians" ) were a confederation of Germanic tribes on the upper Rhine river.  First mentioned  by Cassius Dio in the context of the campaign of Caracalla of 213, the Alemanni captured the Agri Decumates in 260, and later expanded into present-day Alsace, and northern Switzerland, leading to the establishment of the Old High German language in those regions. In 496, the Alemanni were conquered by Frankish leader Clovis and incorporated into his dominions.   Mentioned as still pagan allies of the Christian Franks, the Alemanni were gradually Christianized during the 7th century.

He is best known for independently conceiving the theory of evolution through natural selection; his paper on the subject was jointly published with some of Charles Darwin's writings in 1858.   This prompted Darwin to publish his own ideas in On the Origin of Species.  Wallace did extensive fieldwork, first in the Amazon River basin and then in the Malay Archipelago, where he identified the faunal divide now termed the Wallace Line, which separates the Indonesian archipelago into two distinct parts: a western portion in which the animals are largely of Asian origin, and an eastern portion where the fauna reflect Australasia.

Pausanias says  that he was the author of one of the pediments of the temple of Zeus at Olympia, but this seems a chronological and stylistic impossibility.   Pausanias  also refers to a statue of Ares by Alcamenes that was erected on the Athenian agora, which some have related to the Ares Borghese.

We possess two declamations under his name: On Sophists (Περὶ Σοφιστῶν), directed against Isocrates and setting forth the superiority of extempore over written speeches (a more recently discovered fragment of another speech against Isocrates is probably of later date); Odysseus (perhaps spurious)  in which Odysseus accuses Palamedes of treachery during the siege of Troy.  According to Alcidamas, the highest aim of the orator was the power of speaking extempore on every conceivable subject.

Alexandrists<====>1612<====>Alexandrists The Alexandrists were a school of Renaissance philosophers who, in the great controversy on the subject of personal immortality, adopted the explanation of the De Anima given by Alexander of Aphrodisias.  According to the orthodox Thomism of the Roman Catholic Church, Aristotle rightly regarded reason as a facility of the individual soul.  Against this, the Averroists, led by Agostino Nifo, introduced the modifying theory that universal reason in a sense individualizes itself in each soul and then absorbs the active reason into itself again.   These two theories respectively evolved the doctrine of individual and universal immortality, or the absorption of the individual into the eternal One.

Kolmogorov complexity<====>1635<====>Kolmogorov complexity In algorithmic information theory (a subfield of computer science and mathematics), the Kolmogorov complexity of an object, such as a piece of text, is the length of the shortest computer program (in a predetermined programming language) that produces the object as output. It is a measure of the computational resources needed to specify the object, and is also known as descriptive complexity, Kolmogorov–Chaitin complexity, algorithmic entropy, or program-size complexity.  It is named after Andrey Kolmogorov, who first published on the subject in 1963.   The notion of Kolmogorov complexity can be used to state and prove impossibility results akin to Cantor's diagonal argument, Gödel's incompleteness theorem, and Turing's halting problem.

Autpert's election as abbot caused internal dissent at St.  Vicenzo, and both Pope Stephen III and Charlemagne intervened.   The disagreement was based both on objections to Autpert's personality and to his Frankish origin. He wrote a considerable number of works on the Bible and religious subjects generally.  Among these are commentaries on the Apocalypse, on the Psalms, and on the Song of Solomon; Lives of Saints Paldo, Tuto and Vaso; Assumption of the Virgin; and a Combat between the Virtues and the Vices. 

Abu Bakr<====>1715<====>Abu Bakr    Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq ‘Abdallāh bin Abī Quḥāfah ( ;   573 CE 22 August 634 CE), popularly known as Abu Bakr ( ),    was a senior companion (Sahabi) and—through his daughter Aisha —the father-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.  Abu Bakr became the first openly declared Muslim outside Muhammad's family.

Abu Bakr served as a trusted advisor to Muhammad. 

Ambrose Traversari<====>1716<====>Ambrose Traversari Ambrose Traversari, O. S. B.  Cam. , also referred to as Ambrose of Camaldoli (1386 20 October 1439), was an Italian monk and theologian, who was a prime supporter of the papal cause in the 15th century.  He is honored as a saint by the Camaldolese Order. BiographyTraversari was born near Forlì, at the village of Portico di Romagna in 1386.    At the age of fourteen he entered the Camaldolese Order in the Monastery of St.  Mary of the Angels in Florence, and rapidly became a leading theologian and Hellenist.  In his study of Greek literature his master was Emmanuel Chrysoloras. 

Ambrosians<====>1717<====>AmbrosiansAmbrosians are members of one of the religious brotherhoods which at various times since the 14th century have sprung up in and around Milan and also a 16th-century sect of Anabaptist Ambrosians. OrdersOnly the oldest of the Catholic Ambrosians, the Fratres S.  Ambrosii ad Nemus, had anything more than a very local significance.  This order is known from a bull of Pope Gregory XI addressed to the monks of the church of St Ambrose outside Milan.    This further references Herzog-Hauck's Realencyklopadie, i.  439.  Saint Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, certainly did not found religious orders, though he took an interest in the monastic life and watched over its beginnings in his diocese, providing for the needs of a monastery outside the walls of Milan, as Saint Augustine recounts in his Confessions. 

Ambrosiaster<====>1718<====>AmbrosiasterAmbrosiaster is the name given to the writer of a commentary on St Paul's epistles, "brief in words but weighty in matter," and valuable for the criticism of the Latin text of the New Testament.The commentary itself was written during the papacy of Pope Damasus I, that is, between 366 and 384, and is considered an important document of the Latin text of Paul before the Vulgate of Jerome, and of the interpretation of Paul prior to Augustine of Hippo.  This commentary was erroneously attributed for a long time to St Ambrose.  In 1527, though, Erasmus threw doubt on the accuracy of ascribing the authorship of this document to Ambrose. 

Ambrosius Aurelianus<====>1719<====>Ambrosius Aurelianus  Ambrosius Aurelianus ( ; Anglicised as Ambrose Aurelian and called  Aurelius Ambrosius in the Historia Regum Britanniae and elsewhere) was a war leader of the Romano-British who won an important battle against the Anglo-Saxons in the 5th century, according to Gildas.   He also appeared independently in the legends of the Britons, beginning with the 9th-century Historia Brittonum.  Eventually he was transformed into the uncle of King Arthur, the brother of Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, and predeceases them both. Due to Gildas' description of him, Ambrosius is one of the figures called the Last of the Romans. 

Ammon<====>1722<====>Ammon    Ammon ( ;  ) was an Iron Age Semitic-speaking nation occupying the east of the Jordan River, between the torrent valleys of Arnon and  Jabbok, in present-day Jordan. The chief city of the country was Rabbah or Rabbath Ammon, site of the modern city of Amman, Jordan's capital.  Milcom and Molech (who may be one and the same) are named in the Hebrew Bible as the gods of Ammon.  The people of this kingdom are called "Children of Ammon" or "Ammonites". History The Ammonites occupied the northern Central Trans-Jordanian Plateau from the latter part of the second millennium B. 

Ammonius Hermiae<====>1723<====>Ammonius HermiaeAmmonius Hermiae ( ;  ;   AD) was a Greek philosopher, and the son of the Neoplatonist philosophers Hermias and Aedesia.  He was a pupil of Proclus in Athens, and taught at Alexandria for most of his life, writing commentaries on Plato, Aristotle, and other philosophers. LifeAmmonius' father, Hermias, died when he was a child, and his mother, Aedesia, raised him and his brother, Heliodorus, in Alexandria.  When they reached adulthood, Aedesia accompanied her sons to Athens where they studied under Proclus.  Eventually, they returned to Alexandria, where Ammonius, as head of the Neoplatonist school in Alexandria, lectured on Plato and Aristotle for the rest of his life. 

Ammonius Saccas<====>1724<====>Ammonius Saccas  Ammonius Saccas ( ;  ; fl.  3rd century AD) was a Greek philosopher from Alexandria who was often referred to as one of the founders of Neoplatonism.  He is mainly known as the teacher of Plotinus, whom he taught for eleven years from 232 to 243.  He was undoubtedly the biggest influence on Plotinus in his development of Neoplatonism, although little is known about his own philosophical views.  Later Christian writers stated that Ammonius was a Christian, but it is now generally assumed that there was a different Ammonius of Alexandria who wrote biblical texts. 

Book of Amos<====>1726<====>Book of Amos The Book of Amos  is the third of the Twelve Minor Prophets in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament and the second in the Greek Septuagint tradition.   Amos, an older contemporary of Hosea and Isaiah, Harris, Stephen L. , Understanding the Bible.  Palo Alto: Mayfield.  1985.   was active c.  750 BCE during the reign of Jeroboam II  (788–747 BCE),  making the Book of Amos the first biblical prophetic book written.  Amos lived in the kingdom of Judah but preached in the northern kingdom of Israel.   His major themes of social justice, God's omnipotence, and divine judgment became staples of prophecy. 

Amphipolis<====>1727<====>Amphipolis Amphipolis (  - Amfipoli;  , Amphípolis)   is best known for being a magnificent ancient Greek polis (city), and later a Roman city, whose impressive remains can still be seen. It is famous in history for events such as the battle between the Spartans and Athenians in 422 BC, and also as the place where Alexander the Great prepared for campaigns leading to his invasion of Asia.   Alexander's three finest admirals, Nearchus, Androsthenes and Laomedon, resided in this city and it is also the place where, after Alexander's death, his wife Roxane and their small son Alexander IV were exiled and later murdered. 

Amram<====>1728<====>Amram  In the Book of Exodus, Amram (  ;  ) is the husband of Jochebed and father of Aaron, Moses and Miriam.  In the BibleIn addition to being married to Jochebed, Amram is also described in the Bible as having been related to Jochebed prior to the marriage, although the exact relationship is uncertain; some Greek and Latin manuscripts of the Septuagint state that Jochebed was Amram's father's cousin, and others state that Amram was Jochebed's cousin,  but the Masoretic Text states that she was his father's sister.    He is praised for his faith in the Epistle to the Hebrews. 

Amyntas I of Macedon<====>1729<====>Amyntas I of Macedon Amyntas I (Greek: Ἀμύντας Aʹ;   498 BC) was a king of Macedon.  He was a son of Alcetas I of Macedon.  He married Eurydice and they had a son Alexander. Amyntas was a vassal of Darius I, king of the Persian Achaemenid Empire, since 512/511 BC.  The history of Macedonia may be said to begin with Amyntas' reign.  He was the first of its rulers to have diplomatic relations with other states.    In particular, he entered into an alliance with Hippias of Athens, and when Hippias was driven out of Athens he offered him the territory of Anthemus on the Thermaic Gulf with the object of taking advantage of the feuds between the Greeks. 

Amyntas III of Macedon<====>1730<====>Amyntas III of Macedon Amyntas III (Greek: Ἀμύντας Γ΄; died 370 BC) was king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon in 393 BC, and again from 392 to 370 BC.  He was the son of Arrhidaeus and grandson of Amyntas, one of the sons of Alexander I.His most famous son is Philip II, father of Alexander the Great.  He is historically considered the founder of the unified Macedonian state. ReignHe came to the throne after the ten years of confusion which followed the death of Archelaus I.  But he had many enemies at home; in 393 he was driven out by the Illyrians, but in the following year, with the aid of the Thessalians, he recovered his kingdom. 

Anacharsis<====>1732<====>Anacharsis Anacharsis ( ;  ) was a Scythian philosopher who travelled from his homeland on the northern shores of the Black Sea to Athens in the early 6th century BC and made a great impression as a forthright, outspoken "barbarian".  Reputedly a forerunner of the Cynics, none of his works has survived. LifeAnacharsis the son of Gnurus,  a Scythian chief, was half Greek and from a mixed Hellenic culture, apparently in the region of the Cimmerian Bosporus.  He left his native country to travel in pursuit of knowledge, and came to Athens about 589 BC,  at a time when Solon was occupied with his legislative measures. 

Anah<====>1734<====>Anah  Anah or Ana ( , ʾĀna), formerly also known as Anna,  is an Iraqi town on the Euphrates river, approximately midway between the Gulf of Alexandretta and the Persian Gulf.  Anah lies from west to east on the right bank along a bend of the river just before it turns south towards Hit.  NameThe town is called Ha-na-at  in a Babylonian letter around 2200  ,  A-na-at by the scribes of Tukulti-Ninurta    ,  and An-at by the scribes of Assur-nasir-pal II in 879  .   The name has been connected with the widely worshipped war goddess Anat. 

Ananda<====>1735<====>AnandaĀnanda was a first cousin of Gautama Buddha and one of his ten principal disciples.   Amongst the Buddha's many disciples, Ānanda stood out for having the most retentive memory.  Most of the sutras of the Sutta Pitaka are attributed to his recollection of the Buddha's teachings during the First Buddhist council.  For that reason, he was known as the Guardian of the Dharma. Role in the Pali CanonAccording to Buddhist tradition, every Buddha in the past and to come will have two chief disciples and one attendant during his ministry.  In the case of Gautama Buddha, the pair of chief disciples were Sariputta and Maudgalyayana and the attendant was Ānanda. 

Anaxagoras<====>1737<====>Anaxagoras  Anaxagoras ( ;  , Anaxagoras, "lord of the assembly";   BC) was a Pre-Socratic Greek philosopher.  Born in Clazomenae in the Persian Empire (modern-day Urla, Turkey) Anaxagoras was the first to bring philosophy to Athens.  According to Diogenes Laertius and Plutarch, in later life he was charged with impiety and went into exile in Lampsacus; the charges may have been political, owing to his association with Pericles, if they were not fabricated by later ancient biographers.  Responding to the claims of Parmenides on the impossibility of change, Anaxagoras described the world as a mixture of primary imperishable ingredients, where material variation was never caused by an absolute presence of a particular ingredient, but rather by its relative preponderance over the other ingredients; in his words, "each one is. 

Anaxarchus<====>1738<====>AnaxarchusAnaxarchus ( ;  ; c.  380 – c.  320 BC) was a Greek philosopher of the school of Democritus.  Together with Pyrrho, he accompanied Alexander the Great into Asia.  The reports of his philosophical views suggest that he was a forerunner of Pyrrhonism. LifeAnaxarchus was born at Abdera in Thrace.  He was the companion and friend of Alexander the Great in his Asiatic campaigns.  According to Diogenes Laertius, in response to Alexander's claim to have been the son of Zeus-Ammon, Anaxarchus pointed to his bleeding wound and remarked, "See the blood of a mortal, not ichor, such as flows from the veins of the immortal gods. 

Ancyra (genus)<====>1740<====>Ancyra (genus)  Ancyra is a genus of southeast Asian planthoppers. Members of the genus are well known for having a pair of prolonged filaments at the tips of the forewings that arise near a pair of small glossy spots; this creates the impression of a pair of antennae, with corresponding "eyes" (a remarkable case of automimicry).  The "false head" effect is further reinforced by the bugs' habit of walking backwards when it detects movement nearby, so as to misdirect predators to strike at its rear, rather than at its actual head.References DEFAULTSORT

He then went to the continent, and was a professor of mathematics in Paris by the start of the seventeenth century.   There he published or edited, between the years 1612 and 1619, various geometric and algebraic tracts.

An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding<====>1756<====>An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding  An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding is a book by the Scottish empiricist philosopher David Hume, published in English in 1748.   It was a revision of an earlier effort, Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature, published anonymously in London in 1739–40.  Hume was disappointed with the reception of the Treatise, which "fell dead-born from the press,"  as he put it, and so tried again to disseminate his more developed ideas to the public by writing a shorter and more polemical work. The end product of his labours was the Enquiry.  The Enquiry dispensed with much of the material from the Treatise, in favor of clarifying and emphasizing its most important aspects.

Apollo 13<====>1770<====>Apollo 13Apollo 13 was the seventh manned mission in the Apollo space program and the third intended to land on the Moon.  The craft was launched on April 11, 1970, at 14:13 EST (19:13 UTC) from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank exploded two days later, crippling the Service Module (SM) upon which the Command Module (CM) had depended.  Despite great hardship caused by limited power, loss of cabin heat, shortage of potable water, and the critical need to make makeshift repairs to the carbon dioxide removal system, the crew returned safely to Earth on April 17, 1970, six days after launch. 

Apollo 7<====>1773<====>Apollo 7    Apollo 7 was an October 1968 human spaceflight mission carried out by the United States.  It was the first mission in the United States' Apollo program to carry a crew into space.  It was also the first U. S.  spaceflight to carry astronauts since the flight of Gemini XII in November 1966.  The AS-204 mission, also known as "Apollo 1", was intended to be the first manned flight of the Apollo program.  It was scheduled to launch in February 1967, but a fire in the cabin during a January 1967 test killed the crew. 

Apollo 9<====>1774<====>Apollo 9Apollo 9 was the third manned mission in the United States Apollo space program and the first flight of the Command/Service Module (CSM) with the Lunar Module (LM, pronounced "lem").  Its three-person crew, consisting of Commander James McDivitt, Command Module Pilot David Scott, and Lunar Module Pilot Rusty Schweickart, spent ten days in low Earth orbit testing several aspects critical to landing on the Moon, including the LM engines, backpack life support systems, navigation systems, and docking maneuvers.  The mission was the second manned launch of a Saturn V rocket. After launching on March 3, 1969, the crewmen performed the first manned flight of a LM, the first docking and extraction of a LM, two spacewalks (EVA), and the second docking of two manned spacecraft—two months after the Soviets performed a spacewalk crew transfer between Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5. 

Arthritis<====>1776<====>Arthritis   Arthritis is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints.Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness.   Other symptoms may include redness, warmth, swelling, and decreased range of motion of the affected joints. In some types other organs are also affected.   Onset can be gradual or sudden.   There are over 100 types of arthritis.   The most common forms are osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) and rheumatoid arthritis.   Osteoarthritis usually occurs with age and affects the fingers, knees, and hips.

Acetylene<====>1778<====>Acetylene   Acetylene (systematic name: ethyne) is the chemical compound with the formula C 2 H 2 .  It is a hydrocarbon and the simplest alkyne.   This colorless gas is widely used as a fuel and a chemical building block.  It is unstable in its pure form and thus is usually handled as a solution.   Pure acetylene is odorless, but commercial grades usually have a marked odor due to impurities.  Compressed Gas Association (1995) Material Safety and Data Sheet – Acetylene   As an alkyne, acetylene is unsaturated because its two carbon atoms are bonded together in a triple bond.

Arabic numerals<====>1786<====>Arabic numerals   Arabic numerals, also called Hindu–Arabic numerals,are the ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, based on the Hindu–Arabic numeral system,the most common system for the symbolic representation of numbers in the world today.  In this numeral system, a sequence of digits such as "975" is read as a single number, using the position of the digit in the sequence to interpret its value.  They are descended from the Hindu-Arabic numeral system developed by ancient Indian mathematicians around CE 500.  The system was adopted by Arabic mathematicians in Baghdad and passed on to the Arabs farther west. 

April 9<====>1787<====>April 9 Events190 – Dong Zhuo has his troops evacuate the capital Luoyang and burn it to the ground. 475 – Byzantine Emperor Basiliscus issues a circular letter (Enkyklikon) to the bishops of his empire, supporting the Monophysite christological position. 537 – Siege of Rome: The Byzantine general Belisarius receives his promised reinforcements, 1,600 cavalry, mostly of Hunnic or Slavic origin and expert bowmen.

Apuleius<====>1789<====>Apuleius  Apuleius ( ; also called Lucius Apuleius Madaurensis; c.  124 – c.  170 AD)  was a Latin-language prose writer, Platonist philosopher and rhetorian.He was a Numidian who lived under the Roman Empire  and was from Madauros (now M'Daourouch, Algeria).  He studied Platonism in Athens, travelled to Italy, Asia Minor, and Egypt, and was an initiate in several cults or mysteries.  The most famous incident in his life was when he was accused of using magic to gain the attentions (and fortune) of a wealthy widow.  He declaimed and then distributed a witty tour de force in his own defense before the proconsul and a court of magistrates convened in Sabratha, near ancient Tripoli, Libya. 

Alexander Selkirk<====>1790<====>Alexander Selkirk   Alexander Selkirk (1676 13 December 1721) was a Scottish privateer and Royal Navy officer who spent more than four years as a castaway (1704–1709) after being marooned by his captain on an uninhabited island in the South Pacific Ocean.  He survived that ordeal, but succumbed to tropical illness a dozen years later while serving aboard   off West Africa. Selkirk was an unruly youth, and joined buccaneering voyages to the South Pacific during the War of the Spanish Succession.  One such expedition was on Cinque Ports, commanded by William Dampier.  The ship called in for provisions at the Juan Fernández Islands, and Selkirk judged correctly that the craft was unseaworthy and asked to be left there. 

Anti-ballistic missile<====>1791<====>Anti-ballistic missile An anti-ballistic missile (ABM) is a surface-to-air missile designed to counter ballistic missiles (see missile defense).  Ballistic missiles are used to deliver nuclear, chemical, biological or conventional warheads in a ballistic flight trajectory.  The term "anti-ballistic missile" is a generic term conveying a system designed to intercept and destroy any type of ballistic threat, however it is commonly used for systems specifically designed to counter intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Current counter-ICBM systemsThere are only three systems in the world that can intercept ICBMs.  Besides them, many smaller systems exist (tactical ABMs), that generally cannot intercept intercontinental strategic missiles, even if within range—an incoming ICBM simply moves too fast for these systems.

Acre<====>1797<====>AcreThe acre is a unit of land area used in the imperial and US customary systems.  It is defined as the area of 1 chain by 1 furlong (66 by 660 feet), which is exactly equal to   of a square mile, 43,560 square feet, approximately 4,047 m 2 , or about 40% of a hectare. The acre is commonly used in Antigua and Barbuda,    Australia,  American Samoa,    the Bahamas,    Belize,    the British Virgin Islands,    the Cayman Islands,    Canada,  Dominica,    the Falkland Islands,    Grenada,    Ghana,  Guam,    the Northern Mariana Islands,    India,  Sri Lanka,  Bangladesh,  Nepal,  Ireland,  Jamaica,  Montserrat,    Myanmar,  Pakistan,  Samoa,    St. 

Adenosine triphosphate<====>1800<====>Adenosine triphosphate Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a complex organic chemical that participates in many processes.  Found in all forms of life, ATP is often referred to as the "molecular unit of currency" of intracellular energy transfer.    When consumed in metabolic processes, it converts to either the di- or monophosphates, respectively ADP and AMP.   Other processes regenerate ATP such that the human body recycles its own body weight equivalent in ATP each day.    It is also a precursor to DNA and RNA. From the perspective of biochemistry, ATP is classified as a nucleoside triphosphate, which indicates that it consists of three components, a nitrogenous base (adenine), the sugar ribose, and the triphosphate. 

Ægir<====>1802<====>Ægir  In Norse mythology, Ægir (Old Norse "sea") Lindow (2001:47).   is a sea jötunn associated with the ocean.  He is also known for being a friend of the gods and hosting elaborate parties for them. He is the namesake for the exoplanet previously known as Epsilon Eridani b. Ægir's servants are Fimafeng (killed by Loki) and Eldir. DescriptionThe Nafnaþulur attached to the Prose Edda list Ægir as a giant.  Faulkes (1987:156)  Richard Cleasby and Guðbrandur Vigfússon saw his name as pre-Norse, derived from an ancient Indo-European root.  Cleasby, Vigfússon (1957:758).  AttestationsBoth Hversu Noregr byggðist and Snorri Sturluson in Skáldskaparmál state that Ægir is the same as the sea-giant Hlér, who lives on the Hlésey ("Hlér island", modern Danish Læsø), and this is borne out by kennings. 

Antibiotics<====>1805<====>Antibiotics   Antibiotics (from ancient Greek αντιβιοτικά, antiviotika), also called antibacterials, are a type of antimicrobial  drug used in the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections. They may either kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria.  A limited number of antibiotics also possess antiprotozoal activity. Antibiotics are not effective against viruses such as the common cold or influenza; drugs which inhibit viruses are termed antiviral drugs or antivirals rather than antibiotics. Sometimes the term antibiotic (which means "opposing life") is used to refer to any substance used against microbes,  synonymous with antimicrobial. 

Arnold Schwarzenegger<====>1806<====>Arnold SchwarzeneggerArnold Alois Schwarzenegger ( ;  ; born July 30, 1947) is an Austrian-American actor, producer, businessman, investor, author, philanthropist, activist, politician, and former professional bodybuilder.  He served two terms as the 38th Governor of California from 2003 to 2011. Schwarzenegger began weight training at the age of 15.  He won the Mr.  Universe title at age 20 and went on to win the Mr.  Olympia contest seven times, remaining a prominent presence in bodybuilding and writing many books and articles on the sport.  The Arnold Sports Festival, considered one of the best professional bodybuilding competitions in recent years, is named after him. 

Actium<====>1810<====>ActiumActium (Greek: Ἄκτιον) was the name of an ancient town on a promontory of western Greece in northwestern Acarnania, at the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf).  Actium is chiefly famous as the name given to the nearby naval Battle of Actium, in which Octavian won a decisive victory over Mark Antony on September 2, 31 BC. Actium was situated on the southern side of the strait opposite the later city of Nicopolis built by Octavian.   Since 2002 the peninsular of Actium has been linked with Preveza on the north shore of the Ambracian Gulf by the Aktio-Preveza Undersea Tunnel. 

Amway<====>1812<====>Amway  Amway (short for "American Way") is an American company specializing in the use of multi-level marketing to sell health, beauty, and home care products.  The company was founded in 1959 by Jay Van Andel and Richard DeVos and is based in Ada, Michigan. Amway and its sister companies under Alticor reported sales of $9. 5 billion in 2015.It conducts business through a number of affiliated companies in more than a hundred countries and territories.  Amway was ranked No.  29 among the largest privately held companies in the United States by Forbes in 2015 based on revenue, and No. 

Adam Smith<====>1814<====>Adam Smith  Adam Smith   (16 June 1723 NS  (5 June 1723 OS)  – 17 July 1790) was a Scottish economist, philosopher and author as well as a moral philosopher, a pioneer of political economy and a key figure during the Scottish Enlightenment era.   Smith is best known for two classic works: The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776).  The latter, usually abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics. 

Antoine Lavoisier<====>1822<====>Antoine Lavoisier    Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier (also Antoine Lavoisier after the French Revolution;  ; 26 August 1743 8 May 1794)   Lavoisier, le parcours d'un scientifique révolutionnaire CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique)  was a French nobleman and chemist who was central to the 18th-century chemical revolution and who had a large influence on both the history of chemistry and the history of biology.He is widely considered in popular literature as the "father of modern chemistry".   It is generally accepted that Lavoisier's great accomplishments in chemistry largely stem from his changing the science from a qualitative to a quantitative one. 

Hermann Kolbe<====>1825<====>Hermann Kolbe Hermann Kolbe (Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe, 27 September 1818 – 25 November 1884), was a seminal contributor in the birth of modern organic chemistry.  He was a Professor at Marburg and Leipzig.  Kolbe coined the term synthesis and contributed to the philosophical demise of vitalism through synthesis of the organic substance acetic acid from carbon disulfide, and also contributed to the development of structural theory.  This was done via modifications to the idea of "radicals" and accurate prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols, and to the emerging array of organic reactions through his Kolbe electrolysis of carboxylate salts, the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction in the preparation of aspirin and the Kolbe nitrile synthesis. 

April 18<====>1826<====>April 18 Events796 – King Æthelred I of Northumbria is murdered in Corbridge by a group led by his ealdormen, Ealdred and Wada.

Amitabh Bachchan<====>1828<====>Amitabh BachchanAmitabh Bachchan ( ;  born 11 October 1942) is an Indian film actor, producer, television host, and former politician.  He first gained popularity in the early 1970s for films such as Zanjeer, Deewaar, and Sholay, and was dubbed India's "angry young man" for his on-screen roles in Bollywood.  Referred to as the Shahenshah of Bollywood, Star of the Millennium, or Big B,    he has since appeared in over 190 Indian films in a career spanning almost five decades.   Bachchan is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential actors in the history of Indian cinema as well as world cinema. 

Allomorph<====>1832<====>Allomorph  In linguistics, an  allomorph is a variant form of a morpheme, that is, when a unit of meaning varies in sound without changing meaning.  The term allomorph explains the comprehension of phonological variations for specific morphemes. Allomorphy in English suffixes English has several morphemes that vary in sound but not in meaning.  Examples include the past tense and the plural morphemes. For example, in English, a past tense morpheme is -ed.   It occurs in several allomorphs depending on its phonological environment, assimilating voicing of the previous segment or inserting a schwa when following an alveolar stop:as   or   in verbs whose stem ends with the alveolar stops   or  , such as 'hunted'   or 'banded'  as   in verbs whose stem ends with voiceless phonemes other than  , such as 'fished'  as   in verbs whose stem ends with voiced phonemes other than  , such as 'buzzed'  Notice the "other than" restrictions above. 

Allophone<====>1834<====>Allophone In phonology, an allophone ( ; from the  , állos, "other" and φωνή, phōnē, "voice, sound") is one of a set of multiple possible spoken sounds (or phones) or signs used to pronounce a single phoneme in a particular language.For example,   (as in pin) and   (as in spin which is less aspirated) are allophones for the phoneme   in the English language.  The specific allophone selected in a given situation is often predictable from the phonetic context (such allophones are called positional variants), but sometimes allophones occur in free variation. 

Affix<====>1835<====>Affix In linguistics, an affix is a morpheme that is attached to a word stem to form a new word or word form.  Affixes may be derivational, like English -ness and pre-, or inflectional, like English plural -s and past tense -ed.  They are bound morphemes by definition; prefixes and suffixes may be separable affixes.  Affixations, the linguistic process speakers use form different words by adding morphemes (affixes) at the beginning (prefixation), the middle (infixation) or the end (suffixation) of words. Positional categories of affixesAffixes are divided into many categories, depending on their position with reference to the stem. 

Allegory<====>1837<====>Allegory  As a literary device, an allegory is a metaphor whose vehicle may be a character, place or event, representing real-world issues and occurrences.  Allegory (in the sense of the practice and use of allegorical devices and works) has occurred widely throughout history in all forms of art, largely because it can readily illustrate or convey complex ideas and concepts in ways that are comprehensible or striking to its viewers, readers, or listeners. Writers or speakers typically use allegories as literary devices or as rhetorical devices that convey (semi-)hidden or complex meanings through symbolic figures, actions, imagery, or events, which together create the moral, spiritual, or political meaning the author wishes to convey. 

Allotropy<====>1839<====>Allotropy Allotropy or allotropism ( ) is the property of some chemical elements to exist in two or more different forms, in the same physical state, known as allotropes of these elements.  Allotropes are different structural modifications of an element;  the atoms of the element are bonded together in a different manner.  For example, the allotropes of carbon include diamond (the carbon atoms are bonded together in a tetrahedral lattice arrangement), graphite (the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of a hexagonal lattice), graphene (single sheets of graphite), and fullerenes (the carbon atoms are bonded together in spherical, tubular, or ellipsoidal formations). 

Agathocles of Syracuse<====>1840<====>Agathocles of Syracuse Agathocles ( , Agathoklḗs; 361–289 BC) was a Greek tyrant of Syracuse (317–289 BC) and king of Sicily (304–289 BC). BiographyAgathocles was born at Thermae Himeraeae (modern name Termini Imerese) in Sicily.  The son of a potter who had moved to Syracuse in about 343 BC, he learned his father's trade, but afterwards entered the army along with his brother Antander.  In 333 BC he married the widow of his patron Damas, a distinguished and wealthy citizen.  He was twice banished for attempting to overthrow the oligarchical party in Syracuse.  In 317 BC he returned with an army of mercenaries under a solemn oath to observe the democratic constitution which was established after they took the city. 

Economy of Alberta<====>1841<====>Economy of Alberta Alberta's economy is the sum of all economic activity in Alberta, Canada's fourth largest province by population.   Although Alberta has a presence in many industries such as agriculture, forestry, education, tourism, finance, and manufacturing, the politics and culture of the province have been closely tied to the production of fossil energy since the 1940s.  Alberta—with an estimated 1. 4 billion cubic metres of unconventional oil resource in the bituminous oil sands—leads Canada as an oil producer.   Revenue from oil and natural gas extraction has fueled a series of economic booms in the province's recent history, and economic spin-offs have included petrochemical and pipelines. 

Augustin-Louis Cauchy<====>1842<====>Augustin-Louis Cauchy  Baron Augustin-Louis Cauchy FRS FRSE ( ; 21 August 1789 – 23 May 1857) was a French mathematician and physicist who made pioneering contributions to analysis.  He was one of the first to state and prove theorems of calculus rigorously, rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra of earlier authors.  He almost singlehandedly founded complex analysis and the study of permutation groups in abstract algebra.  A profound mathematician, Cauchy had a great influence over his contemporaries and successors.  His writings range widely in mathematics and mathematical physics. "More concepts and theorems have been named for Cauchy than for any other mathematician (in elasticity alone there are sixteen concepts and theorems named for Cauchy). 

Archimedes<====>1844<====>Archimedes    Archimedes of Syracuse ( ;;  ) was a Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer.    Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity.  Generally considered the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time,   Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying concepts of infinitesimals and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems, including the area of a circle, the surface area and volume of a sphere, and the area under a parabola. 

Alternative medicine<====>1845<====>Alternative medicine    Alternative medicine or fringe medicine consists of practices claimed to have the healing effects of medicine but which are disproven, unproven, impossible to prove, or are excessively harmful in relation to their effect;   and where the scientific consensus is that the therapy does not, or cannot, work because the known laws of nature are violated by its basic claims; or where it is considered so much worse than conventional treatment that it would be unethical to offer as treatment.   Alternative therapies or diagnoses are not part of medicine  or science-based healthcare systems. 

Archimedean solid<====>1847<====>Archimedean solid In geometry, an Archimedean solid is one of the 13 solids first enumerated by Archimedes.   They are the semi-regular convex polyhedra composed of regular polygons meeting in identical vertices, excluding the 5 Platonic solids (which are composed of only one type of polygon) and excluding the prisms and antiprisms.  They differ from the Johnson solids, whose regular polygonal faces do not meet in identical vertices. "Identical vertices" means that for any two vertices, there is a global isometry of the entire solid that takes one vertex to the other.    pointed out a widespread error in the literature on Archimedean solids: some authors only require that the faces that meet at one vertex be related by a local isometry to the faces that meet at any other vertex, and incorrectly claim that there are 13 solids satisfying this definition.

Antiprisms are a subclass of the prismatoids and are a (degenerate) type of snub polyhedra. 

Natural history of Africa<====>1853<====>Natural history of Africa The natural history of Africa encompasses some of the well known megafauna of that continent. Natural history is the study and description of organisms and natural objects, especially their origins, evolution, and interrelationships. FloraThe vegetation of Africa follows very closely the distribution of heat and moisture.  The northern and southern temperate zones have a flora distinct from that of the continent generally, which is tropical.  In the countries bordering the Mediterranean, there are groves of orange and olive trees, evergreen oaks, cork trees and pines, intermixed with cypresses, myrtles, arbutus and fragrant tree-heaths. South of the Atlas Range the conditions alter. 

Geography of Africa<====>1854<====>Geography of AfricaAfrica is a continent comprising 63 political territories, representing the largest of the great southward projections from the main mass of Earth's surface.Within its regular outline, it comprises an area of  , including adjacent islands.  Its highest mountain is Mount Kilimanjaro, its largest lake is Lake Victoria and its longest river is the Nile. Separated from Europe by the Mediterranean Sea  and from much of Asia by the Red Sea, Africa is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the Isthmus of Suez  (which is transected by the Suez Canal),   wide. 

Approval voting<====>1857<====>Approval voting   Approval voting is a single-winner electoral system.  Each voter may "approve" of (i. e. , select) any number of candidates.  The winner is the most-approved candidate. Robert J.  Weber coined the term "Approval Voting" in 1971.   Guy Ottewell described the system in 1977.   It was more fully published in 1978 by political scientist Steven Brams and mathematician Peter Fishburn.  DescriptionApproval voting can be considered a form of range voting, with the range restricted to two values, 0 and 1—or a form of majority judgment, with grades restricted to good and poor. 

Arizona State University<====>1859<====>Arizona State University   Arizona State University (commonly referred to as ASU or Arizona State) is a public metropolitan research university    on five campuses across the Phoenix metropolitan area,and four regional learning centers throughout Arizona.  The 2018 university ratings by U. S.  News & World Report rank ASU No.  1 among the Most Innovative Schools in America for the third year in a row    and has ranked ASU No.  115 in National Universities with overall score of 47/100 with 83% of student applications accepted. 

April 14<====>1862<====>April 14Events43 BC – Battle of Forum Gallorum: Mark Antony, besieging Caesar's assassin Decimus Brutus in Mutina, defeats the forces of the consul Pansa, but is then immediately defeated by the army of the other consul, Aulus Hirtius. AD 69 – Vitellius, commander of the Rhine armies, defeats Emperor Otho in the Battle of Bedriacum and seizes the throne. AD 70 – Siege of Jerusalem: Titus, son of emperor Vespasian, surrounds the Jewish capital with four Roman legions. 193 – Septimius Severus is proclaimed Roman emperor by the army in Illyricum (in the Balkans). 966 – After his marriage to the Christian Doubravka of Bohemia, the pagan ruler of the Polans, Mieszko I, converts to Christianity, an event considered to be the founding of the Polish state. 

Astoria, Oregon<====>1864<====>Astoria, Oregon   Astoria is a port city and the seat of Clatsop County, Oregon, United States.Situated near the mouth of the Columbia River where it meets the Pacific Ocean, the city was named after John Jacob Astor, an investor from New York City whose American Fur Company founded Fort Astoria at the site in 1811,  .  Astoria was incorporated by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on October 20, 1876.  It holds the distinction of being the first permanent United States settlement on the Pacific coast and for having the first U. 

Alarums and Excursions<====>1866<====>Alarums and ExcursionsAlarums and Excursions (A&E) is an amateur press association started in June 1975 by Lee Gold (at the request of Bruce Pelz, who felt that discussion of Dungeons & Dragons was taking up too much space in APA-L, the APA of Los Angeles's SF Fandom, usually collated at the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society).   It was the first publication to focus solely on role-playing games.  The initial aim of the publication was to prevent the playing styles to become so divergent that people couldn't participate in games together.    Each issue is a collection of contributions from different authors, often featuring game design discussions, rules variants, write-ups of game sessions, reviews, and comments on others contributions. 

Alfred Jarry<====>1869<====>Alfred Jarry   Alfred Jarry ( ; 8 September 1873 – 1 November 1907) was a French symbolist writer who is best known for his play Ubu Roi (1896).   He also coined the term and philosophical concept of 'pataphysics.  Jarry was born in Laval, Mayenne, France, and his mother was from Brittany.   He was associated with the Symbolist movement.  His play Ubu Roi is often cited as a forerunner of Dada, and to the Surrealist and Futurist movements of the 1920s and 1930.  Jarry wrote in a variety of hybrid genres and styles, prefiguring the postmodern. 

Amalric<====>1870<====>AmalricAmalric or Amalaric (also Americ, Almerich, Emeric, Emerick and other variations) is a personal name derived from the tribal name Amal (referring to the Gothic Amali) and ric (Gothic reiks) meaning "ruler, prince".  Equivalents in different languages include:French: Amaury (surname/given name), Amalric (surname), Amaurich (surname), Maury (surname)German: Amalrich, EmmerichItalian: Amerigo, ArrigoHungarian: ImreLatin: Amalricus, Americus, Almericus, EmericusGreek: EmerikosPolish: Amalaryk, Amalryk, EmerykDutch: Emmerik, Amerik, Portuguese: Amauri, Américo, AméricaSpanish: AméricoSerbo-Croatian: MirkoGiven nameAmalaric (502–531), King of the Visigoths from 526 to 531Malaric (fl.  585), King of the SueviAmalric of Nesle (fl.  1151–1180), Patriarch of Jerusalem from 1158 to 1180Amalric I of Jerusalem (1136–1174), King of Jerusalem from 1162 to 1174Amalric II of Jerusalem (fl. 

Amalric of Jerusalem<====>1871<====>Amalric of Jerusalem  Amalric ( ;  ; 1136 11 July 1174) was King of Jerusalem from 1163, and Count of Jaffa and Ascalon before his accession.  He was the second son of Melisende and Fulk of Jerusalem, and succeeded his older brother Baldwin III.  During his reign, Jerusalem became more closely allied with the Byzantine Empire, and the two states launched an unsuccessful invasion of Egypt.  Meanwhile, the Muslim territories surrounding Jerusalem began to be united under Nur ad-Din and later Saladin.  He was the father of three future rulers of Jerusalem, Sibylla, Baldwin IV, and Isabella I. 

Aimery of Cyprus<====>1872<====>Aimery of Cyprus  Aimery of Lusignan ( ; before 1155 1 April 1205), erroneously referred to as Amalric or Amaury in earlier scholarship, was the first King of Cyprus, reigning from 1196 to his death.  He also reigned as King of Jerusalem from his marriage to Isabella I in 1197 to his death.  He was the younger son of Hugh VIII of Lusignan, a nobleman in Poitou.  After participating in a rebellion against Henry II of England in 1168, he went to the Holy Land and settled in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. His marriage to Eschiva of Ibelin (whose father, Baldwin of Ibelin was an influential nobleman) strengthened his position in the kingdom. 

Anthemius of Tralles<====>1873<====>Anthemius of TrallesAnthemius of Tralles ( , Medieval Greek:  , Anthémios o Trallianós;   – 533   558)  was a Greek from Tralles who worked as a geometer and architect in Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire.  With Isidore of Miletus, he designed the Hagia Sophia for Justinian I.  LifeAnthemius was one of the five sons of Stephanus of Tralles, a physician.  His brothers were Dioscorus, Alexander, Olympius, and Metrodorus.  Dioscorus followed his father's profession in Tralles; Alexander did so in Rome and became one of the most celebrated medical men of his time; Olympius became a noted lawyer; and Metrodorus worked as a grammarian in Constantinople. 

Absalon<====>1874<====>Absalon  Absalon or Axel    (  21 March 1201) was a Danish archbishop and statesman, who was the Bishop of Roskilde from 1158 to 1192 and Archbishop of Lund from 1178 until his death.  He was the foremost politician and churchfather of Denmark in the second half of the 12th century, and was the closest advisor of King Valdemar I of Denmark.  He was a key figure in the Danish policies of territorial expansion in the Baltic Sea, Europeanization in close relationship with the Holy See, and reform in the relation between the Church and the public. 

Adhemar of Le Puy<====>1875<====>Adhemar of Le Puy  Adhemar (also known as Adémar, Aimar, or Aelarz) de Monteil (died 1 August 1098) was one of the principal figures of the First Crusade and was bishop of Puy-en-Velay from before 1087.  He was the chosen representative of Pope Urban II for the expedition to the Holy Land.  Remembered for his martial prowess, he led knights and men into battle and fought beside them, particularly at Dorylaeum and Antioch.  Adhemar is said to have carried the Holy Lance in the Crusaders’ desperate breakout at Antioch on 28 June 1098, in which superior Islamic forces under the atabeg Kerbogha were routed, securing the city for the Crusaders.

Alphonse, Count of Poitiers<====>1878<====>Alphonse, Count of PoitiersAlphonse or Alfonso (11 November 1220 21 August 1271) was the Count of Poitou from 1225 and Count of Toulouse (as Alphonse II) from 1249.  As count of Toulouse, he also governed the Marquisate of Provence. LifeBirth and early lifeBorn at Poissy, Alphonse was a son of Louis VIII, King of France and Blanche of Castile.  He was a younger brother of Louis IX of France and an older brother of Charles I of Sicily.  In 1229, his mother, who was regent of France, forced the Treaty of Paris on Raymond VII of Toulouse after his rebellion. 

Alfonso Jordan<====>1879<====>Alfonso JordanAlfonso Jordan ( ;  ;  ;  ) (1103–1148) was the Count of Tripoli (1105–09), Count of Rouergue (1109–48) and Count of Toulouse, Margrave of Provence and Duke of Narbonne (1112–48, as Alfons I). LifeHe was the son of Raymond IV of Toulouse by his third wife, Elvira of Castile.  He was born in the castle of Mont Pèlerin in Tripoli while his father was on the First Crusade.  He was given the name "Jourdain" after being baptised in the Jordan River.  Alfonso's father died when he was two years old and he remained under the guardianship of his cousin, William Jordan, Count of Cerdagne, until he was five. 

Ambroise<====>1880<====>Ambroise Ambroise, sometimes Ambroise of Normandy,  (flourished  ) was a Norman poet and chronicler of the Third Crusade, author of a work called  , which describes in rhyming Old French verse the adventures of   as a crusader.   The poem is known to us only through one Vatican manuscript, and long escaped the notice of historians.    The credit for detecting its value belongs to Gaston Paris, although his edition (1897) was partially anticipated by the editors of the  , who published some selections in the twenty-seventh volume of their Scriptores (1885). 

Art Deco<====>1881<====>Art Deco  Art Deco, sometimes referred to as Deco, is a style of visual arts, architecture and design that first appeared in France just before World War I.   Art Deco influenced the design of buildings, furniture, jewelry, fashion, cars, movie theatres, trains, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners.    It took its name, short for Arts Décoratifs, from the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes (International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts) held in Paris in 1925.    It combined modernist styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials. 

ASCII art<====>1884<====>ASCII art   ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable (from a total of 128) characters defined by the ASCII Standard from 1963 and ASCII compliant character sets with proprietary extended characters (beyond the 128 characters of standard 7-bit ASCII ).  The term is also loosely used to refer to text based visual art in general.  ASCII art can be created with any text editor, and is often used with free-form languages.  Most examples of ASCII art require a fixed-width font (non-proportional fonts, as on a traditional typewriter) such as Courier for presentation. 

Alexius<====>1887<====>Alexius Alexius is the Latinized form of the given name Alexios ( , polytonic  , "defender", cf.  Alexander), especially common in the later Byzantine Empire.  Variants include Alexis with the Russian Aleksey and its Ukrainian counterpart Oleksa/Oleksiy deriving from this form.  The female form is Alexia ( ) and its variants such as Alessia (which male form is Alessio) in Italian.  It may refer to:RulersAlexios I Komnenos (1048–1118), Byzantine emperorAlexios II Komnenos (1167–1183), Byzantine emperorAlexios III, Byzantine emperorAlexios IV, Byzantine emperorAlexios V, Byzantine emperorAlexios I of Trebizond, Emperor of TrebizondAlexios II of Trebizond, Emperor of TrebizondAlexios III of Trebizond, Emperor of TrebizondAlexios IV of Trebizond, Emperor of TrebizondAlexius Mikhailovich (1629–1676), Tsar of RussiaAlexius Petrovich (1690–1718), Russian tsarevichReligious figuresAlexius, Metropolitan of Moscow (1354–1378)Patriarch Alexius I of Constantinople (1025–1043)Alexius (c. 

American English<====>1890<====>American English  American English (AmE, AE, AmEng, USEng, en-US),  sometimes called United States English or U. S.  English,   is the set of varieties of the English language native to the United States of America.  English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and is the common language used by the federal government, considered the de facto language of the country because of its widespread use but not established as the official language of the country, despite being given official status by 32 of the 50 state governments. 

Albert Spalding<====>1893<====>Albert Spalding  Albert Goodwill Spalding (September 2, 1849 – September 9, 1915) was an American pitcher, manager and executive in the early years of professional baseball, and the co-founder of A. G.  Spalding sporting goods company.  He was born and raised in Byron, Illinois.   He played major league baseball between 1871 and 1878.  Spalding set a trend when he started wearing a baseball glove, and eventually opened his sporting goods store. After his retirement as a player, Spalding remained active with the Chicago White Stockings as president and part-owner.  In the 1880s, he took players on the first world tour of baseball. 

Africa Alphabet<====>1894<====>Africa Alphabet  The Africa Alphabet (also International African Alphabet or IAI alphabet) was developed in 1928 under the lead of Diedrich Westermann.  He developed it with a group of Africanists at the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures (later the IAI) in London.  Its aim was to enable people to write all the African languages for practical and scientific purposes without the need of diacritics.  It is based on the International Phonetic Alphabet with a few differences, such as j and y, which instead have the same (consonant) sound values as in English. This alphabet has influenced development of orthographies of many African languages (serving "as the basis for the transcription" of about 60, by one count ), but not all, and discussions of harmonization of systems of transcription that led to, among other things, adoption of the African reference alphabet. 

Acquire<====>1896<====>Acquire  Acquire is a multi-player mergers and acquisitions themed board game.  It is played with tiles representing hotels that are arranged on the board, play money and stock certificates.  The object of the game is to earn the most money by developing and merging hotel chains.  When a chain in which a player owns stock is acquired by a larger chain, players earn money based on the size of the acquired chain.  At the end of the game, all players liquidate their stock in order to determine which player has the most money.   It was one of the most popular games in the 1960s 3M bookshelf game series, and the only one still published in the United States. 

Australian English<====>1897<====>Australian English    Australian English (AuE, en-AU ) is a major variety of the English language, used throughout Australia.  Although English has no official status in the Constitution, Australian English is the country's national and de facto official language as it is the first language of the majority of the population. Australian English began to diverge from British English after the founding of the Colony of New South Wales in 1788 and was recognised as being different from British English by 1820.  It arose from the intermingling of early settlers from a great variety of mutually intelligible dialectal regions of the British Isles and quickly developed into a distinct variety of English,    which differs considerably from other varieties of English in vocabulary, accent, pronunciation, register, grammar and spelling. 

American Airlines Flight 77<====>1902<====>American Airlines Flight 77   American Airlines Flight 77 was a scheduled American Airlines domestic transcontinental passenger flight from Washington Dulles International Airport in Dulles, Virginia, to Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, California.  The Boeing 757-223 aircraft serving the flight was hijacked by five men affiliated with al-Qaeda on September 11, 2001, as part of the September 11 attacks.  They deliberately crashed the plane into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, near Washington, D. C. , killing all 64 people on board, including the five hijackers and six crew, as well as 125 people in the building. 

Ambush<====>1905<====>Ambush  An ambush is a long-established military tactic in which combatants take advantage of concealment and the element of surprise to attack unsuspecting enemy combatants from concealed positions, such as among dense underbrush or behind hilltops.  Ambushes have been used consistently throughout history, from ancient to modern warfare.  In the 20th century, an ambush  might involve thousands of soldiers on a large scale, such as over a choke point such as a mountain pass, or a small irregular band or insurgent group attacking a regular armed force patrol. HistoryThe use by early humans of the ambush may date as far back as two million years when anthropologists have recently suggested that ambush techniques were used to hunt large game. 

Abzyme<====>1908<====>AbzymeAn abzyme (from antibody and enzyme), also called catmab (from catalytic monoclonal antibody), and most often called catalytic antibody, is a monoclonal antibody with catalytic activity.   Abzymes are usually raised in lab animals immunized against synthetic haptens, but some natural abzymes can be found in normal humans (anti-vasoactive intestinal peptide autoantibodies) and in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, where they can bind to and hydrolyze DNA.  To date abzymes display only weak, modest catalytic activity and have not proved to be of any practical use.    They are, however, subjects of considerable academic interest. 

Adaptive radiation<====>1909<====>Adaptive radiation In evolutionary biology, adaptive radiation is a process in which organisms diversify rapidly from an ancestral species into a multitude of new forms, particularly when a change in the environment makes new resources available, creates new challenges, or opens new environmental niches. Starting with a recent single ancestor, this process results in the speciation and phenotypic adaptation of an array of species exhibiting different morphological and physiological traits.  An example of adaptive radiation would be the avian species of the Hawaiian honeycreepers.   Via natural selection, these birds adapted rapidly and converged based on the different environments of the Hawaiian islands. 

Agarose gel electrophoresis<====>1910<====>Agarose gel electrophoresisAgarose gel electrophoresis is a method of gel electrophoresis used in biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, and clinical chemistry to separate a mixed population of macromolecules such as DNA or proteins in a matrix of agarose, one of the two main components of agar.  The proteins may be separated by charge and/or size (isoelectric focusing agarose electrophoresis is essentially size independent), and the DNA and RNA fragments by length.   Biomolecules are separated by applying an electric field to move the charged molecules through an agarose matrix, and the biomolecules are separated by size in the agarose gel matrix. 

Allele<====>1911<====>Allele An allele (/əˈliːl/)    is a variant form of a given gene.   Sometimes, different alleles can result in different observable phenotypic traits, such as different pigmentation.  A good example of this trait of color variation is the work Gregor Mendel did with the white and purple flower colors in pea plants; discovering that each color was the result of a “pure line” trait which could be used as a control for future experiments.  However, most genetic variations result in little or no observable variation. The word "allele" is a short form of allelomorph ("other form", a word coined by William Bateson and Edith Rebecca Saunders  Bateson, W. 

Ampicillin<====>1912<====>Ampicillin    Ampicillin is an antibiotic used to prevent and treat a number of bacterial infections, such as respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, meningitis, salmonellosis, and endocarditis.   It may also be used to prevent group B streptococcal infection in newborns.   It is used by mouth, by injection into a muscle, or intravenously.Like all antibiotics, it is not useful for the treatment of viral infections.  Common side effects include rash, nausea, and diarrhea.   It should not be used in people who are allergic to penicillin.   Serious side effects may include Clostridium difficile colitis or anaphylaxis. 

Antimicrobial resistance<====>1914<====>Antimicrobial resistance   Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is the ability of a microbe to resist the effects of medication previously used to treat them.    The term includes the more specific "antibiotic resistance", which applies only to bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics.   Resistant microbes are more difficult to treat, requiring alternative medications or higher doses, both of which may be more expensive or more toxic.  Microbes resistant to multiple antimicrobials are called multidrug resistant (MDR); or sometimes superbugs.    Resistance arises through one of three mechanisms: natural resistance in certain types of bacteria, genetic mutation, or by one species acquiring resistance from another. 

Antigen<====>1915<====>AntigenIn immunology, an antigen is a molecule capable of inducing an immune response (to produce an antibody) in the host organism.   Sometimes antigens are part of the host itself in an autoimmune disease.  Antigens are "targeted" by antibodies.  Each antibody (immune response) is specifically produced by the immune system to match an antigen after cells in the immune system come into contact with it; this allows a precise identification or matching of the antigen and the initiation of a tailored response.  The antibody is said to "match" the antigen in the sense that it can bind to it due to an adaptation performed to a region of the antibody; because of this, many different antibodies are produced, each with specificity to bind a different antigen while sharing the same basic structure. 

Autosome<====>1916<====>Autosome An autosome is a chromosome that is not an allosome (a sex chromosome).    The members of an autosome pair in a diploid cell have the same morphology unlike those in allosome pairs which may have different structure.  The DNA in autosomes is collectively known as atDNA or auDNA.  For example, humans have a diploid genome that usually contains 22 pairs of autosomes and one allosome pair (46 chromosomes total).  The autosome pairs are labeled with numbers (1–22 in humans) roughly in order of their sizes in base pairs, while allosomes are labelled with their letters.

Specifically, it may refer to:Aquila (constellation), the astronomical constellation, the EagleAquila (genus), a genus of birds including some eaglesAquila (name), a given name or surnameAquila (Roman), a Roman military standard PeopleLucius Pontius Aquila, one of the assassins of Julius Caesar in the 1st century BCEGaius Julius Aquila, Roman knight, 1st century CEVedius Aquila, an ancient Roman general in the 1st century CE who fought in the Year of the Four EmperorsJulius Gallus Aquila, Roman jurist, probably 2nd century CEAquila Romanus, Latin grammarian, 3rd century CEPriscilla and Aquila, early Christian converts who appear in the New TestamentAquila of Sinope, translator of the Old Testament into GreekAquila Chase, early Puritan settler in the American colonies and founder of the influential Chase familyPlacesAquila, Michoacán, town in MexicoAquila, Switzerland, former municipality in the canton of TicinoAquila, Veracruz, municipality in MexicoAquila Private Game Reserve, South AfricaAquileia, an ancient Roman city in ItalyL'Aquila, sometimes Aquila, the regional capital of Abruzzo in ItalyProvince of L'Aquila, ItalyWork titles and brand namesAquila (journal), an ornithological journalAquila, book by Andrew NorrissAquila (children's magazine), a children's magazineAquila (TV series), a BBC TV production for children based on the Norriss bookAquila Suite – 12 Arpeggio Concert Etudes for Solo Piano, a piano compositionAquila squadron, the enemy Yellow Squadron in the video game Ace Combat 04: Shattered SkiesAquila Theatre, a theatre company currently of New YorkAquila Airways, a British flying boat operator (1948–1958)Aquila, Inc., a former electric and gas utility in Kansas City, Missouri, United StatesAquila Italiana, Italian car manufacturer or brandAquila Capital, an independent investment firm in Hamburg, GermanyAquila racing cars, a Danish firmHyosung GV250, a cruiser motorcycle nicknamed the "Aquila"Maritime vesselsUSS Aquila (AK-47), an Aquila-class cargo ship commissioned by the U.S. Navy for service in World War IIUSS Aquila (PHM-4), a hydrofoil formerly operated by the U.S. NavyItalian aircraft carrier Aquila, a World War II Italian aircraft carrierAircraftAngus Aquila, a British aircraftAquila A 210, a German lightweight aircraftBristol Aquila, an aircraft engineFacebook Aquila, Facebook's design for an atmospheric satelliteLockheed MQM-105 Aquila, the U.S. Army's first battlefield reconnaissance droneFictionAquilla, a character in the wargame HeroscapeAquila, a game server in the MMORPG MapleStoryAquila, Captain Crowe Almedio's ship in the video game Star Ocean: The Last HopeImperial Aquila seal, symbol of the Imperium (Warhammer 40,000) in the fictional Warhammer 40,000 universeAquila, a ship captained by Ratonhnhaké:ton, the protagonist character in the video game Assassin's Creed IIIAquila, a weapon available to the player character Dante in the video game DmC: Devil May CryAquila, a world available with membership in the computer games Wizard101 and Pirate101Aquila Yuna, one of main characters in the anime Saint Seiya OmegaSee alsoAquilia (disambiguation)Aguila (disambiguation)Aquilinus (disambiguation)Aquilla (disambiguation)Aquillia (gens)Balanus aquila, a species of barnacleMacroglossum aquila, a species of mothAquila Court Building of Omaha, NebraskaRoman Catholic Archdiocese of L'Aquila, Italy  

Al-Qaeda<====>1921<====>Al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda (  or  ;    ,  , translation: "The Base", "The Foundation" or "The Fundament" and alternatively spelled al-Qaida, al-Qæda and sometimes al-Qa'ida) is a militant Sunni Islamist multi-national organization founded in 1988  .   by Osama bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam,  and several other Arab volunteers who fought against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s.   Al-Qaeda operates as a network made up of Islamic extremist, Salafist jihadists.  It has been designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations Security Council, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union, the United States, Russia, India, and various other countries (see below). 

Alessandro Volta<====>1923<====>Alessandro VoltaAlessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio Volta ( ; 18 February 1745 – 5 March 1827) was an Italian physicist, chemist, and a pioneer of electricity and power, Giuliano Pancaldi, "Volta: Science and culture in the age of enlightenment", Princeton University Press, 2003.   Alberto Gigli Berzolari, "Volta's Teaching in Como and Pavia" - Nuova voltiana   who is credited as the inventor of the electrical battery and the discoverer of methane.  He invented the Voltaic pile in 1799, and reported the results of his experiments in 1800 in a two-part letter to the President of the Royal Society. 

Argo Navis<====>1924<====>Argo NavisArgo Navis (the Ship Argo), or simply Argo, was a large constellation in the southern sky that has since been divided into the three constellations of Carina, Puppis and Vela.  The genitive was "Argus Navis", abbreviated "Arg".  Flamsteed and other early modern astronomers called the constellation just Navis (the Ship), genitive "Navis", abbreviated "Nav". It was identified in Greek mythology with the Argo, the ship used by Jason and the Argonauts that sailed to Colchis in search of the Golden Fleece.   The original constellation is presently found near the southern horizon of the Mediterranean sky, becoming visible in springtime and sailed westward, skimming along the "river of the Milky Way. 

Andromeda (mythology)<====>1925<====>Andromeda (mythology) In Greek mythology, Andromeda is the daughter of the Ethiopian king Cepheus and his wife Cassiopeia.  When Cassiopeia's hubris leads her to boast that Andromeda is more beautiful than the Nereids, Poseidon sends the sea monster Cetus to ravage Andromeda as divine punishment.   Andromeda is stripped and chained naked to a rock as a sacrifice to sate the monster, but is saved from death by Perseus. Her name is the Latinized form of the Greek   (Androméda) or   (Andromédē): "ruler of men",  from   (anēr, andrós) "man", and medon, "ruler". 

Antlia<====>1926<====>Antlia   Antlia ( ; from Ancient Greek ἀντλία) is a constellation in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere.  Its name means "pump" in Latin; it represents an air pump.  Originally Antlia Pneumatica, the constellation was established by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century, though its name was later abbreviated by John Herschel.  Located close to the stars forming the old constellation of the ship Argo Navis, Antlia is completely visible from latitudes south of 49 degrees north. Antlia is a faint constellation; its brightest star is Alpha Antliae, an orange giant that is a suspected variable star, ranging between apparent magnitudes 4. 

Ara (constellation)<====>1927<====>Ara (constellation) Ara (Latin: "The Altar") is a southern constellation situated between Scorpius and Triangulum Australe.  Ara (Greek: Βωμός) was one of the 48 Greek constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union. The orange supergiant Beta Arae is the brightest star in the constellation, with an apparent magnitude of 2. 85—marginally brighter than the blue-white Alpha Arae.  Seven star systems host planets.  The sunlike star Mu Arae hosts four planets, while Gliese 676 is a binary red dwarf system with four planets. 

Arkansas<====>1930<====>Arkansas Arkansas (    ) is a state in the southeastern region of the United States, home to over 3 million people as of 2017. Its name is of Siouan derivation from the language of the Osage denoting their related kin, the Quapaw Indians.   The state's diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the Ozark and the Ouachita Mountains, which make up the U. S.  Interior Highlands, to the densely forested land in the south known as the Arkansas Timberlands, to the eastern lowlands along the Mississippi River and the Arkansas Delta. 

Apus<====>1933<====>Apus   Apus is a small constellation in the southern sky.  It represents a bird-of-paradise, and its name means "without feet" in Greek because the bird-of-paradise was once wrongly believed to lack feet.  First depicted on a celestial globe by Petrus Plancius in 1598, it was charted on a star atlas by Johann Bayer in his 1603 Uranometria.  The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and gave the brighter stars their Bayer designations in 1756. The five brightest stars are all reddish in hue.  Shading the others at apparent magnitude 3. 8 is Alpha Apodis, an orange giant that has around 48 times the diameter and 928 times the luminosity of the Sun. 

Abadan, Iran<====>1934<====>Abadan, Iran    Abadan (  Ābādān) is a city in and the capital of Abadan County, Khuzestan Province which is located in southwest of Iran.  It lies on Abadan Island (  long, 3–19 km or 2–12 miles wide), the island is bounded in the west by the Arvand waterway and to the east by the Bahmanshir outlet of the Karun River (the Shatt al-Arab),   from the Persian Gulf,    near the Iraqi-Iran border. EtymologyThe earliest mention of the island of Abadan, if not the port itself is found in works of the geographer Marcian, who renders the name "Apphadana". 

Alexander Fleming<====>1937<====>Alexander Fleming    Sir Alexander Fleming    (6 August 1881 – 11 March 1955) was a Scottish physician, microbiologist, and pharmacologist.  His best-known discoveries are the enzyme lysozyme in 1923 and the world's first antibiotic substance benzylpenicillin (Penicillin G) from the mould Penicillium notatum in 1928, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945 with Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain.    He wrote many articles on bacteriology, immunology, and chemotherapy. Fleming was knighted for his scientific achievements in 1944.   In 1999, he was named in Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century. 

Andrew Carnegie<====>1938<====>Andrew Carnegie   Andrew Carnegie (   , but commonlyor    ; MacKay, p.  29.   November 25, 1835 August 11, 1919) was a Scottish-American industrialist, business magnate, and philanthropist. Carnegie led the expansion of the American steel industry in the late 19th century and is often identified as one of the richest people (and richest Americans).   He became a leading philanthropist in the United States and in the British Empire.  During the last 18 years of his life, he gave away about $350 million Andrew Carnegie's Legacy  . 

Approximant consonant<====>1939<====>Approximant consonant Approximants are speech sounds that involve the articulators approaching each other but not narrowly enough  nor with enough articulatory precision  to create turbulent airflow.  Therefore, approximants fall between fricatives, which do produce a turbulent airstream, and vowels, which produce no turbulence.This class of sounds includes lateral approximants like   (as in less), non-lateral approximants like   (as in rest), and semivowels like   and   (as in yes and west, respectively).  Before Peter Ladefoged coined the term "approximant" in the 1960s,  the term "frictionless continuant" referred to non-lateral approximants. 

Astronomer Royal<====>1940<====>Astronomer Royal Astronomer Royal is a senior post in the Royal Households of the United Kingdom.  There are two officers, the senior being the Astronomer Royal dating from 22 June 1675; the second is the Astronomer Royal for Scotland dating from 1834. The post was created by King Charles II in 1675, at the same time as he founded the Royal Observatory Greenwich.  He appointed John Flamsteed, instructing him " . "  The Astronomer Royal was director of the Royal Observatory Greenwich from the establishment of the post in 1675 until 1972. 

Aeon<====>1941<====>Aeon   The word aeon  , also spelled eon  (in American English) and æon, originally meant "life", "vital force" or "being", "generation" or "a period of time", though it tended to be translated as "age" in the sense of  "ages", "forever", "timeless" or "for eternity".  It is a Latin transliteration from the koine Greek word   (ho aion), from the archaic    (aiwon).  In Homer it typically refers to life or lifespan.  Its latest meaning is more or less similar to the Sanskrit word kalpa and Hebrew word olam.  A cognate Latin  word aevum or aeuum (cf. 

Airline<====>1942<====>Airline  An airline is a company that provides air transport services for traveling passengers and freight.  Airlines utilize aircraft to supply these services and may form partnerships or alliances with other airlines for codeshare agreements.  Generally, airline companies are recognized with an air operating certificate or license issued by a governmental aviation body. Airlines vary in size, from small domestic airlines to full-service international airlines.  Airline services can be categorized as being intercontinental, domestic, regional, or international, and may be operated as scheduled services or charters.  The largest airline currently is American Airlines Group. HistoryThe first airlinesDELAG, Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-Aktiengesellschaft was the world's first airline. 

Australian Democrats<====>1943<====>Australian Democrats   The Australian Democrats is an Australian political party in existence since 1977.  It was Australia's largest minor party from its formation in 1977 through to 2004 and frequently held the balance of power in the Senate during that time. The party was formed as a merger of the Australia Party and the New Liberal Movement, both of which were descended from Liberal Party splinter groups.  The party's inaugural leader was Don Chipp, a former Liberal cabinet minister, who famously promised to "keep the bastards honest".  At the 1977 federal election, the Democrats polled 11. 

Australian Capital Territory<====>1944<====>Australian Capital Territory   The Australian Capital Territory (ACT; known as the Federal Capital Territory until 1938) is Australia's federal district, located in the south-east of the country and enclaved within the state of New South Wales.  It contains Canberra, the capital city of Australia. Geographically, the territory is bounded by the Goulburn-Cooma railway line in the east, the watershed of Naas Creek in the south, the watershed of the Cotter River in the west, and the watershed of the Molonglo River in the north-east.  The Jervis Bay Territory, around the southern end of the Beecroft Peninsula, which is the northern headland of Jervis Bay, is also governed as if it were part of the ACT. 

Unit of alcohol<====>1946<====>Unit of alcoholUnits of alcohol are used in the United Kingdom (UK) as a measure to quantify the actual alcoholic content within a given volume of an alcoholic beverage, in order to provide guidance on total alcohol consumption. A number of other countries (including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the US) use the concept of a standard drink, the definition of which varies from country to country, for the same purpose.   Standard drinks were referred to in the first UK guidelines (1984) that published "safe limits" for drinking, but these were replaced by references to "alcohol units" in the 1987 guidelines and the latter term has been used in all subsequent UK guidance. 

Aotus<====>1947<====>AotusAotus (the name is derived from the Ancient Greek words for "earless" in both cases: the monkey is missing external ears, and the pea is missing earlike bracteoles) may refer to:Aotus (plant), one of the plant genera commonly known as golden peas in the family Fabaceae (bean family)Aotus (monkey), the genus of night monkeys in the family AotidaeAOTUS, the acronym for the Archivist of the United States 

Ally McBeal<====>1948<====>Ally McBeal    Ally McBeal is  an American legal comedy-drama television series, originally aired on Fox from September 8, 1997 to May 20, 2002.  Created by David E.  Kelley, the series stars Calista Flockhart in the title role as a lawyer working in the fictional Boston law firm Cage and Fish, with other lawyers whose lives and loves were eccentric, humorous, and dramatic.  The series received critical acclaim in its early seasons, winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy in 1997 and 1998, and also winning the Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1999. 

Andreas Capellanus<====>1949<====>Andreas Capellanus Andreas Capellanus (Capellanus meaning "chaplain"), also known as Andrew the Chaplain, and occasionally by a French translation of his name, André le Chapelain, was the 12th-century author of a treatise commonly known as De amore ("About Love"), and often known in English, somewhat misleadingly, as The Art of Courtly Love, though its realistic, somewhat cynical tone suggests that it is in some measure an antidote to courtly love.  Little is known of Andreas Capellanus's life, but he is presumed to have been a courtier of Marie de Champagne, and probably of French origin. His workDe Amore was written at the request of Marie de Champagne, daughter of King Louis VII of France and of Eleanor of Aquitaine. 

American Civil Liberties Union<====>1950<====>American Civil Liberties Union   The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is a nonpartisan nonprofit  organization   whose stated mission is "to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to every person in this country by the Constitution and laws of the United States. "  It works through litigation and lobbying.  The ACLU has over 1,000,000 members and an annual budget of over $100 million.  Local affiliates of the ACLU are active in almost all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.  The ACLU provides legal assistance in cases when it considers civil liberties to be at risk.

The company is headquartered in San Jose, California, United States.  Adobe has historically focused upon the creation of multimedia and creativity software products, with a more recent foray towards rich Internet application software development.  It is best known for Photoshop, an image editing software, Acrobat Reader, the Portable Document Format (PDF) and Adobe Creative Suite, as well as its successor Adobe Creative Cloud. Adobe was founded in December 1982    by John Warnock and Charles Geschke, who established the company after leaving Xerox PARC in order to develop and sell the PostScript page description language. 

Alexander Technique<====>1957<====>Alexander Technique The Alexander Technique (A. T. ), named after its creator Frederick Matthias Alexander, is an educational process that attempts to develop the ability to avoid unnecessary muscular tension by retraining physical movement.  Alexander believed that poor habits in posture and movement damaged spatial self-awareness; he believed the technique was a mental training technique as well.  Alexander developed his technique's principles in the 1890s  in an attempt to address voice loss during public speaking-a probable result of unintentionally retaining childhood asthma breathing problems.  He credited his method with allowing him to pursue his passion for reciting in Shakespearean theater. 

Andrea Alciato<====>1960<====>Andrea AlciatoAndrea Alciato (8 May 1492 12 January 1550),  commonly known as Alciati (Andreas Alciatus), was an Italian jurist and writer.    He is regarded as the founder of the French school of legal humanists. BiographyAlciati was born in Alzate Brianza, near Milan, and settled in France in the early 16th century.  He displayed great literary skill in his exposition of the laws, and was one of the first to interpret the civil law by the history, languages and literature of antiquity, and to substitute original research for the servile interpretations of the glossators.He published many legal works, and some annotations on Tacitus and accumulated a sylloge of Roman inscriptions from Milan and its territories, as part of his preparation for his history of Milan, written in 1504-05. 

Apparent magnitude<====>1962<====>Apparent magnitude The apparent magnitude ( ) of a celestial object is a number that is a measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth.  The brighter an object appears, the lower its magnitude value (i. e.  inverse relation).  The Sun, at apparent magnitude of −27, is the brightest object in the sky.  It is adjusted to the value it would have in the absence of the atmosphere.  Furthermore, the magnitude scale is logarithmic; a difference of one in magnitude corresponds to a change in brightness by a factor of  , or about 2. 

Absolute magnitude<====>1963<====>Absolute magnitude Absolute magnitude is a measure of the luminosity of a celestial object, on a logarithmic astronomical magnitude scale.  An object's absolute magnitude is defined to be equal to the apparent magnitude that the object would have if it were viewed from a distance of exactly 10 parsecs (32. 6 light years), with no extinction (or dimming) of its light due to absorption by interstellar dust particles.  By hypothetically placing all objects at a standard reference distance from the observer, their luminosities can be directly compared on a magnitude scale.  As with all astronomical magnitudes, the absolute magnitude can be specified for different wavelength ranges corresponding to specified filter bands or passbands; for stars a commonly quoted absolute magnitude is the absolute visual magnitude, which uses the visual (V) band of the spectrum (in the UBV photometric system). 

Apollo 1<====>1965<====>Apollo 1  Apollo 1, initially designated AS-204, was the first manned mission of the United States Apollo program, which had as its ultimate goal a manned lunar landing.   The low Earth orbital test of the Apollo Command/Service Module never made its target launch date of February 21, 1967.  A cabin fire during a launch rehearsal test on January 27 at Cape Kennedy Air Force Station Launch Complex 34 killed all three crew members—Command Pilot Virgil I.  "Gus" Grissom, Senior Pilot Ed White, and Pilot Roger B.  Chaffee—and destroyed the Command Module (CM).  The name Apollo 1, chosen by the crew, was officially retired by NASA in commemoration of them on April 24, 1967. 

Apollo 10<====>1966<====>Apollo 10  Apollo 10 was the fourth manned mission in the United States Apollo space program, and the second (after Apollo 8) to orbit the Moon.  Launched on May 18, 1969, it was the F mission: a "dress rehearsal" for the first Moon landing, testing all of the components and procedures, just short of actually landing.  The Lunar Module (LM) followed a descent orbit to within   of the lunar surface, at the point where powered descent for landing would normally begin.   Its success enabled the first landing to be attempted on the Apollo 11 mission two months later. 

Apollo 12<====>1967<====>Apollo 12   Apollo 12 was the sixth manned flight in the United States Apollo program and the second to land on the Moon.  It was launched on November 14, 1969, from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, four months after Apollo 11.  Mission commander Charles "Pete" Conrad and Lunar Module Pilot Alan L.  Bean performed just over one day and seven hours of lunar surface activity while Command Module Pilot Richard F.  Gordon remained in lunar orbit.  The landing site for the mission was located in the southeastern portion of the Ocean of Storms. 

Apollo 14<====>1968<====>Apollo 14 Apollo 14 was the eighth manned mission in the United States Apollo program, and the third to land on the Moon.  It was the last of the "H missions," targeted landings with two-day stays on the Moon with two lunar EVAs, or moonwalks. Commander Alan Shepard, Command Module Pilot Stuart Roosa, and Lunar Module Pilot Edgar Mitchell launched on their nine-day mission on January 31, 1971 at 4:04:02 p. m.  local time after a 40-minute, 2 second delay due to launch site weather restrictions, the first such delay in the Apollo program.   Shepard and Mitchell made their lunar landing on February 5 in the Fra Mauro formation - originally the target of the aborted Apollo 13 mission. 

Apollo 15<====>1969<====>Apollo 15   Apollo 15 was the ninth manned mission in the United States' Apollo program, the fourth to land on the Moon, and the eighth successful manned mission.  It was the first of what were termed "J missions", long stays on the Moon, with a greater focus on science than had been possible on previous missions.  It was also the first mission on which the Lunar Roving Vehicle was used. The mission began on July 26, 1971, and ended on August 7.  At the time, NASA called it the most successful manned flight ever achieved. 

Apollo 16<====>1970<====>Apollo 16  Apollo 16 was the tenth manned mission in the United States Apollo space program, the fifth and penultimate to land on the Moon and the first to land in the lunar highlands.  The second of the so-called "J missions," it was crewed by Commander John Young, Lunar Module Pilot Charles Duke and Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly.  Launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 12:54 PM EST on April 16, 1972, the mission lasted 11 days, 1 hour, and 51 minutes, and concluded at 2:45 PM EST on April 27. Young and Duke spent 71 hours—just under three days—on the lunar surface, during which they conducted three extra-vehicular activities or moonwalks, totaling 20 hours and 14 minutes. 

Apollo 17<====>1971<====>Apollo 17    Apollo 17 was the final mission of NASA's Apollo program.  Launched at 12:33 a. m.  Eastern Standard Time (EST) on December 7, 1972, with a crew made up of Commander Eugene Cernan, Command Module Pilot Ronald Evans, and Lunar Module Pilot Harrison Schmitt, it was the last use of Apollo hardware for its original purpose; after Apollo 17, extra Apollo spacecraft were used in the Skylab and Apollo–Soyuz programs. Apollo 17 was the first night launch of a U. S.  human spaceflight and the final manned launch of a Saturn V rocket.  It was a "J-type mission" which included three days on the lunar surface, extended scientific capability, and the third Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV). 

American Revolution<====>1973<====>American RevolutionThe American Revolution was a colonial revolt that took place between 1765 and 1783.  The American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies won independence from Great Britain, becoming the United States of America.  They defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War in alliance with France and others. Members of American colonial society argued the position of "no taxation without representation", starting with the Stamp Act Congress in 1765.  They rejected the authority of the British Parliament to tax them because they lacked members in that governing body.  Protests steadily escalated to the Boston Massacre in 1770 and the burning of the Gaspee in Rhode Island in 1772, followed by the Boston Tea Party in December 1773, during which Patriots destroyed a consignment of taxed tea.

Chaucer scholars have also identified this date (in 1387) as the start of the book's pilgrimage to Canterbury. 

Alan Ayckbourn<====>1975<====>Alan Ayckbourn   Sir Alan Ayckbourn, CBE (born 12 April 1939) is a prolific English playwright and director.  He has written and produced more than seventy full-length plays in Scarborough and London and was, between 1972 and 2009, the artistic director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough, where all but four of his plays have received their first performance.  More than 40 have subsequently been produced in the West End, at the Royal National Theatre or by the Royal Shakespeare Company since his first hit Relatively Speaking opened at the Duke of York's Theatre in 1969. 

Alpha Centauri<====>1979<====>Alpha Centauri  Alpha Centauri (α Centauri, abbreviated Alpha Cen, α Cen) is the closest star system to the Solar System, being   from the Sun.  It consists of three stars: Alpha Centauri A (also named Rigil Kentaurus   ) and Alpha Centauri B, which form the binary star Alpha Centauri AB, and a small and faint red dwarf, Alpha Centauri C (also named Proxima Centauri ), which is loosely gravitationally bound and orbiting the other two at a current distance of about  .  To the unaided eye, the two main components appear as a single point of light with an apparent visual magnitude of −0. 

Amiga<====>1980<====>Amiga   The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore starting in 1985.  The original model was part of a wave of 16 and 32 bit computers that featured 256KB or more of RAM, mouse-based GUIs, and significantly improved graphics and audio over 8-bit systems.  This wave included the Atari ST—released the same year—Apple's Macintosh, and later the Apple IIGS.  Based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor, the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound, including sprites and a blitter, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. 

Actinophryid<====>1986<====>Actinophryid The actinophryids are an order of heliozoa.  They are the most common heliozoa in fresh water and can also be found in marine and soil habitats.    Actinophryids are unicellular and roughly spherical in shape, with many axopodia that radiate outward from the cell body.  Axopodia are a type of pseudopodia that are supported by hundreds of microtubules arranged in a needle-like internal structure.  These axopods adhere to passing prey and assist with cell movement, as well as playing a part in cell division and cell fusion.  DescriptionActinophryids are largely aquatic protozoa with a spherical cell body and many needle-like axopodia. 

Abel Tasman<====>1988<====>Abel Tasman   Abel Janszoon Tasman ( ; 1603 – 10 October 1659) was a Dutch seafarer, explorer, and merchant, best known for his voyages of 1642 and 1644 in the service of the Dutch East India Company (VOC).  He was the first known European explorer to reach the islands of Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) and New Zealand, and to sight the Fiji islands. First Pacific voyageAbel Jans Tasman was born in 1603 in Lutjegast, a small village in the province of Groningen, in the north of the Netherlands.  The oldest available source mentioning him dates 27 December 1631 when, as a seafarer living in Amsterdam, the 28-year-old became engaged to marry 21-year-old Jannetje Tjaers   from the Jordaan district of the city.

Algebraic geometry<====>1997<====>Algebraic geometry    Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics, classically studying zeros of multivariate polynomials.  Modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques, mainly from commutative algebra, for solving  geometrical problems about these sets of zeros. The fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic varieties, which are geometric manifestations of solutions of systems of polynomial equations.  Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are: plane algebraic curves, which include lines, circles, parabolas, ellipses, hyperbolas, cubic curves like elliptic curves, and quartic curves like lemniscates and Cassini ovals.

It is the 11th-most populous city in the United States and the 4th-most populous city in Texas.  It is the fastest growing large city in the United States,   the second most populous state capital after Phoenix, Arizona,  and the southern-most state capital in the contiguous 48 states.  As of the Census Bureau's July 1, 2016 estimate, Austin has a population of 947,890. 

Argument from morality<====>2003<====>Argument from morality  The argument from morality is an argument for the existence of God.  Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order.  Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist.  Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe.  They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it.  The argument from morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics. 

Auschwitz concentration camp<====>2006<====>Auschwitz concentration camp    Auschwitz concentration camp ( ,  , also   or  ) was a network of German Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps built and operated by Nazi Germany in annexed Polish areas during World War II.  It consisted of   (the original camp), Auschwitz II–Birkenau (a combination concentration/extermination camp),   (a labor camp to staff an IG Farben factory), and 45 satellite camps. Auschwitz I was first constructed to hold Polish political prisoners, who began to arrive in May 1940.  The first extermination of prisoners took place in September 1941, and Auschwitz II–Birkenau went on to become a major site of the Nazi Final Solution to the Jewish Question. 

Archery<====>2007<====>Archery   Archery  is the sport, practice or skill of using a bow to propel arrows.  The word comes from the Latin arcus.  Historically, archery has been used for hunting and combat.  In modern times, it is mainly a competitive sport and recreational activity.  A person who participates in archery is typically called an archer or a bowman, and a person who is fond of or an expert at archery is sometimes called a toxophilite.  History The bow and arrow seems to have been invented in the later Paleolithic or early Mesolithic periods. 

Alvar Aalto<====>2009<====>Alvar Aalto  Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto ( ; 3 February 1898 – 11 May 1976) was a Finnish architect and designer.His work includes architecture, furniture, textiles and glassware, as well as sculptures and paintings, though he never regarded himself as an artist, seeing painting and sculpture as "branches of the tree whose trunk is architecture. "    Aalto's early career runs in parallel with the rapid economic growth and industrialization of Finland during the first half of the twentieth century and many of his clients were industrialists; among these were the Ahlström-Gullichsen family. 

Comparison of American and British English<====>2011<====>Comparison of American and British English    The English language was first introduced to the Americas by British colonization, beginning in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.  Similarly, the language spread to numerous other parts of the world as a result of British trade and colonisation elsewhere and the spread of the former British Empire, which, by 1921, held sway over a population of 470–570 million people, approximately a quarter of the world's population at that time. Over the past 400 years, the form of the language used in the Americas—especially in the United States—and that used in the United Kingdom have diverged in a few minor ways, leading to the versions now occasionally referred to as American English and British English. 

Atomic semantics<====>2014<====>Atomic semanticsAtomic semantics is a term which describes a type of guarantee provided by a data register shared by several processors in a parallel machine or in a network of computers working together. Atomic semantics are very strong.  An atomic register provides strong guarantees even when there is concurrency and failures. A read/write register R stores a value and is accessed by two basic operations: read and write(v).  A read  returns the value stored in R and write(v) changes the value stored in R to v. A register is called atomic if it satisfies the two following properties:1) Each invocation op of a read or write operation:•Must appear as if it were executed at a single point τ(op) in time. 

Antarctic Circumpolar Current<====>2015<====>Antarctic Circumpolar Current The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is an ocean current that flows clockwise from west to east around Antarctica.  An alternative name for the ACC is the West Wind Drift.  The ACC is the dominant circulation feature of the Southern Ocean and has a mean transport estimated at 100-150 Sverdrups (Sv, million m³/s),  or possibly even higher,  making it the largest ocean current.  The current is circumpolar due to the lack of any landmass connecting with Antarctica and this keeps warm ocean waters away from Antarctica, enabling that continent to maintain its huge ice sheet. 

Arbor Day<====>2017<====>Arbor Day   Arbor Day (or Arbour; from the Latin arbor, meaning tree) is a holiday in which individuals and groups are encouraged to plant trees.  Today, many countries observe such a holiday.  Though usually observed in the spring, the date varies, depending on climate and suitable planting season.  OriginsFirst Arbor Day in the worldThe Spanish village of Mondoñedo held the first documented arbor plantation festival in the world organized by its mayor in 1594.  The place remains as Alameda de los Remedios and it is still planted with lime and horse-chestnut trees.  A humble granite marker and a bronze plate recall the event.

He was a founding member and the de facto early leader of the mathematical Bourbaki group.  The philosopher Simone Weil was his sister.   LifeAndré Weil was born in Paris to agnostic Alsatian Jewish parents who fled the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine by the German Empire after the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–71.  The famous philosopher Simone Weil was Weil's only sibling. 

Achaeans (Homer)<====>2020<====>Achaeans (Homer)   The Achaeans ( ;   Akhaioí, "the Achaeans" or "of Achaea") constitute one of the collective names for the Greeks in Homer's Iliad (used 598 times) and Odyssey.  The other common names are Danaans ( ;   Danaoi; used 138 times in the Iliad) and Argives ( ;  ; used 182 times in the Iliad) while Panhellenes (  Panhellenes, "All of the Greeks") and Hellenes ( ;    Hellenes) both appear only once;  all of the aforementioned terms were used synonymously to denote a common Greek civilizational identity. 

Atle Selberg<====>2021<====>Atle Selberg  Atle Selberg (14 June 1917 – 6 August 2007) was a Norwegian mathematician known for his work in analytic number theory, and in the theory of automorphic forms, in particular bringing them into relation with spectral theory.  He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1950. Early yearsSelberg was born in Langesund, Norway, the son of teacher Anna Kristina Selberg and mathematician Ole Michael Ludvigsen Selberg.  Two of his brothers also went on to become mathematicians as well, and the remaining one became a professor of engineering.   While he was still at school he was influenced by the work of Srinivasa Ramanujan and he found an exact analytical formula for the partition function as suggested by the works of Ramanujan; however, this result was first published by Hans Rademacher. 

Aeschylus<====>2023<====>Aeschylus  Aeschylus (  or  ;    Aiskhulos;  ; c.  525/524 – c.  456/455 BC) was an ancient Greek tragedian.  He is often described as the father of tragedy. Academics' knowledge of the genre begins with his work,  and understanding of earlier tragedies is largely based on inferences from his surviving plays.   According to Aristotle, he expanded the number of characters in theater allowing conflict among them; characters previously had interacted only with the chorus.  The remnant of a commemorative inscription, dated to the 3rd century BC, lists four, possibly eight, dramatic poets (probably including Choerilus, Phrynichus, and Pratinas) who had won tragic victories at the Dionysia before Aeschylus had. 

Amber Road<====>2024<====>Amber Road The Amber Road was an ancient trade route for the transfer of amber from coastal areas of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.   Prehistoric trade routes between Northern and Southern Europe were defined by the amber trade.   As an important commodity, sometimes dubbed "the gold of the north", amber was transported from the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts overland by way of the Vistula and Dnieper rivers to Italy, Greece, the Black Sea, Syria and Egypt over a period of thousands of years. AntiquityFrom at least the sixteenth century BC, amber was moved from Northern Europe to the Mediterranean area.

Acting<====>2032<====>Acting    Acting is an activity in which a story is told by means of its enactment by an actor or actress who adopts a character—in theatre, television, film, radio, or any other medium that makes use of the mimetic mode. Acting involves a broad range of skills, including a well-developed imagination, emotional facility, physical expressivity, vocal projection, clarity of speech, and the ability to interpret drama.  Acting also demands an ability to employ dialects, accents, improvisation, observation and emulation, mime, and stage combat.  Many actors train at length in specialist programmes or colleges to develop these skills. 

Delian League<====>2037<====>Delian League  The Delian League, founded in 478 BC,  was an association of Greek city-states, members numbering between 150,  173,  to 330   under the leadership of Athens, whose purpose was to continue fighting the Persian Empire after the Greek victory in the Battle of Plataea at the end of the Second Persian invasion of Greece.  The League's modern  name derives from its official meeting place, the island of Delos, where congresses were held in the temple and where the treasury stood until, in a symbolic gesture,  Pericles moved it to Athens in 454 BC. 

August Horch<====>2038<====>August Horch August Horch (12 October 1868 – 3 February 1951) was a German engineer and automobile pioneer, the founder of the manufacturing giant which would eventually become Audi.

Avionics<====>2039<====>Avionics Avionics are the electronic systems used on aircraft, artificial satellites, and spacecraft.  Avionic systems include communications, navigation, the display and management of multiple systems, and the hundreds of systems that are fitted to aircraft to perform individual functions.  These can be as simple as a searchlight for a police helicopter or as complicated as the tactical system for an airborne early warning platform.  The term avionics is a portmanteau of the words aviation and electronics. HistoryThe term "avionics" was coined by the journalist Philip J.  Klass as a portmanteau of "aviation electronics".    Many modern avionics have their origins in World War II wartime developments. 

Ares<====>2041<====>Ares Ares ( ;  , Áres  ) is the Greek god of war.  He is one of the Twelve Olympians, and the son of Zeus and Hera.   In Greek literature, he often represents the physical or violent and untamed aspect of war, in contrast to his sister the armored Athena, whose functions as a goddess of intelligence include military strategy and generalship.  The Greeks were ambivalent toward Ares: although he embodied the physical valor necessary for success in war, he was a dangerous force, "overwhelming, insatiable in battle, destructive, and man-slaughtering. 

Alexander Grothendieck<====>2042<====>Alexander Grothendieck  Alexander Grothendieck ( ;  ;  ; 28 March 1928 – 13 November 2014) was a German-born French mathematician who became the leading figure in the creation of modern algebraic geometry.   His research extended the scope of the field and added elements of commutative algebra, homological algebra, sheaf theory and category theory to its foundations, while his so-called "relative" perspective led to revolutionary advances in many areas of pure mathematics. He is considered by many to be the greatest mathematician of the 20th century.  Born in Germany, Grothendieck was raised and lived primarily in France. 

Alcoholics Anonymous<====>2047<====>Alcoholics Anonymous  Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship    founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr.  Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio.  AA's stated "primary purpose" is to "stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety".With other early members, Bill Wilson and Bob Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development.  AA's initial Twelve Traditions were introduced in 1946 to help the fellowship be stable and unified while disengaged from "outside issues" and influences. The Traditions recommend that members remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, and that AA groups avoid official affiliations with other organizations. 

Alpha compositing<====>2049<====>Alpha compositing In computer graphics, alpha compositing is the process of combining an image with a background to create the appearance of partial or full transparency.  It is often useful to render image elements in separate passes, and then combine the resulting multiple 2D images into a single, final image called the composite.  For example, compositing is used extensively when combining computer-rendered image elements with live footage. In order to combine these image elements correctly, it is necessary to keep an associated matte for each element.  This matte contains the coverage information—the shape of the geometry being drawn—making it possible to distinguish between parts of the image where the geometry was actually drawn and other parts of the image that are empty. 

Array data structure<====>2052<====>Array data structure   In computer science, an array data structure, or simply an array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key.  An array is stored so that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.    The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array. For example, an array of 10 32-bit integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as 10 words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, . 

Advance Australia Fair<====>2053<====>Advance Australia Fair   "Advance Australia Fair" is the national anthem of Australia.  Created by the Scottish-born composer Peter Dodds McCormick, the song was first performed in 1878 and sung in Australia as a patriotic song.  It replaced "God Save the Queen" as the official national anthem in 1984, following a plebiscite to choose the national song in 1977.  Other songs and marches have been influenced by "Advance Australia Fair", such as the Australian vice-regal salute. HistoryOrigin"Advance Australia Fair" was composed in the late 19th century by Peter Dodds McCormick under the pen-name "Amicus" (which means "friend" in Latin). 

Automatic number announcement circuit<====>2061<====>Automatic number announcement circuitAn automatic number announcement circuit (ANAC) is a component of a central office of a telephone company that provides a service to installation and service technicians to determine the telephone number of a line.  The facility has a telephone number that may be called to listen to an automatic announcement that includes the caller's telephone number. The ANAC number is useful primarily during the installation of landline telephones to quickly identify one of multiple lines. OperationA technician calls the local telephone number of the automatic number announcement service.  This call is connected to equipment at a local central office that uses a voice synthesizer or digital samples to announce the telephone number of the line calling in. 

Amerigo Vespucci<====>2062<====>Amerigo Vespucci    Amerigo Vespucci ( ; March 9, 1454 February 22, 1512) was an Italian explorer, financier, navigator and cartographer who first demonstrated in about 1502 that Brazil and the West Indies did not represent Asia's eastern outskirts as initially conjectured from Columbus' voyages, but instead constituted an entirely separate landmass hitherto unknown to people of the Old World.  In 1505 he became a citizen of Spain.  Colloquially referred to as the New World, this second super continent came to be termed "Americas", deriving its name from Americus, the Latin version of Vespucci's first name.

Auguste Rodin<====>2065<====>Auguste Rodin    François Auguste René Rodin (12 November 1840 – 17 November 1917), known as Auguste Rodin ( ;  ), was a French sculptor.  Although Rodin is generally considered the progenitor of modern sculpture,  he did not set out to rebel against the past.  He was schooled traditionally, took a craftsman-like approach to his work, and desired academic recognition, Hale, 76.   although he was never accepted into Paris's foremost school of art. Sculpturally, Rodin possessed a unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, deeply pocketed surface in clay.  Many of his most notable sculptures were roundly criticized during his lifetime. 

Ann Arbor, Michigan<====>2067<====>Ann Arbor, Michigan    Ann Arbor is a city in the U. S.  state of Michigan and the county seat of Washtenaw County. The 2010 census recorded its population to be 113,934, making it the sixth largest city in Michigan.  Ann Arbor is home to the University of Michigan.  The university shapes Ann Arbor's economy significantly as it employs about 30,000 workers, including about 12,000 in the medical center.  The city's economy is also centered on high technology, with several companies drawn to the area by the university's research and development infrastructure, and by its graduates. 

Act of Settlement 1701<====>2070<====>Act of Settlement 1701The Act of Settlement is an Act of the Parliament of England that was passed in 1701  to settle the succession to the English and Irish crowns on Protestants only.  The next Protestant in line to the throne was the Electress Sophia of Hanover, a granddaughter of James VI of Scotland and I of England.  After her the crowns would descend only to her non-Roman Catholic heirs. The act was prompted by the failure of King William III and Queen Mary II, as well as of Mary's sister Queen Anne, to produce any surviving children, and the Roman Catholic religion of all other members of the House of Stuart. 

Aircraft hijacking<====>2075<====>Aircraft hijacking  Aircraft hijacking (also  air piracy or aircraft piracy, especially within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States and in the US state of Mississippi, and as skyjacking in some nations) is the unlawful seizure of an aircraft by an individual or a group.   In most cases, the pilot is forced to fly according to the orders of the hijackers.  Occasionally, however, the hijackers have flown the aircraft themselves, such as the September 11 attacks, and in at least three cases, the plane was hijacked by the official pilot or co-pilot. Unlike the typical hijackings of land vehicles or ships, skyjacking is not usually committed for robbery or theft: most aircraft hijackers intend to use the passengers as hostages, either for monetary ransom or for some political or administrative concession by authorities. 

Acropolis of Athens<====>2076<====>Acropolis of Athens  The Acropolis of Athens (Ancient Greek: Ἀκρόπολις,  tr.   Akrópolis;   ,  tr.   Akrópoli Athenón  ) is an ancient citadel located on a rocky outcrop above the city of Athens and contains the remains of several ancient buildings of great architectural and historic significance, the most famous being the Parthenon.   The word  acropolis is from the Greek words   (akron, "highest point, extremity") and   (polis, "city").   Although the term acropolis is generic and there are many other acropoleis in Greece, the significance of the Acropolis of Athens is such that it is commonly known as "The Acropolis" without qualification.

The CD-ROM edition included numerous annotations by Vinge on his thoughts and intentions about different parts of the book, and was later released as a standalone e-book (no longer available). 

Aeronautics<====>2082<====>Aeronautics Aeronautics (from the ancient Greek words ὰήρ āēr, which means "air", and ναυτική nautikē which means "navigation", i. e.  "navigation into the air") is the science or art involved with the study, design, and manufacturing of air flight capable machines, and the techniques of operating aircraft and rockets within the atmosphere.  The British Royal Aeronautical Society identifies the aspects of "aeronautical Art, Science and Engineering" and "the profession of Aeronautics (which expression includes Astronautics). "  While the term—literally meaning "sailing the air"—originally referred solely to the science of operating the aircraft, it has since been expanded to include technology, business, and other aspects related to aircraft. 

Auguste and Louis Lumière<====>2083<====>Auguste and Louis Lumière  The Lumière ( ) brothers, Auguste Marie Louis Nicolas   (19 October 1862, Besançon, France – 10 April 1954, Lyon) and Louis Jean   (5 October 1864, Besançon, France – 7 June 1948, Bandol),   were among the first filmmakers in history.  They patented an improved cinematograph, which in contrast to Thomas Edison's "peepshow" kinetoscope allowed simultaneous viewing by multiple parties.  HistoryThe Lumière brothers were born in Besançon, France, to Charles-Antoine Lumière (1840–1911) [1]  and Jeanne Joséphine Costille Lumière, who were married in 1861 and moved to Besançon, setting up a small photographic portrait studio where Auguste and Louis were born.

Acts and the Gospel of Luke make up a two-part work, Luke–Acts, by the same anonymous author, usually dated to around 80–90 AD.    The first part, the Gospel of Luke, tells how God fulfilled his plan for the world's salvation through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, the promised Messiah. 

Assyria<====>2085<====>Assyria    Assyria was a major Mesopotamian kingdom and empire of the ancient Near East and the Levant.  It existed as a state from perhaps as early as the 25th century BC in the form of the Assur city-state,  until its collapse between 612 BC and 609 BC, spanning the Early to Middle Bronze Age through to the late Iron Age. From the end of the seventh century BC to the mid-seventh century AD, it survived as a geopolitical entity, for the most part ruled by foreign powers, although a number of Neo-Assyrian states arose at different times during the Parthian and early Sasanian Empires between the mid-second century BC and late third century AD, a period which also saw Assyria become a major centre of Syriac Christianity and the birthplace of the Church of the East.

Aphasia<====>2088<====>Aphasia   Aphasia is an inability to comprehend and formulate language because of damage to specific brain regions.This damage is typically caused by a cerebral vascular accident (stroke), or head trauma, however these are not the only possible causes.  To be diagnosed with aphasia, a person's speech or language must be significantly impaired in one (or several) of the four communication modalities following acquired brain injury or have significant decline over a short time period (progressive aphasia).  The four communication modalities are auditory comprehension, verbal expression, reading and writing, and functional communication. 

Aorta<====>2089<====>Aorta   The aorta ( ) is the main artery in the human body, originating from the left ventricle of the heart and extending down to the abdomen, where it splits into two smaller arteries (the common iliac arteries).  The aorta distributes oxygenated blood to all parts of the body through the systemic circulation.  StructureSectionsIn anatomical sources, the aorta is usually divided into sections.One way of classifying a part of the aorta is by anatomical compartment, where the thoracic aorta (or thoracic portion of the aorta) runs from the heart to the diaphragm. 

Abimelech<====>2093<====>Abimelech  Abimelech (also spelled Abimelek or Avimelech;  ) was the name of multiple Philistine kings mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.

In their 51 years of existence, the Falcons have compiled a record of 350–450–6 (341–437–6 in the regular season and 9–13 in the playoffs), winning division championships in 1980, 1998, 2004, 2010, 2012, and 2016. 

Heathenry in the United States<====>2104<====>Heathenry in the United StatesHeathenry is a modern Pagan new religious movement that has been active in the United States since at least the early 1970s.  Although the term "Heathenry" is often employed to cover the entire religious movement, different Heathen groups within the United States often prefer the term "Ásatrú" or "Odinism" as self-designations. Heathenry appeared in the United States during the 1960s, at the same time as the wider emergence of modern Paganism in the United States.  Among the earliest American group was the Odinist Fellowship, founded by Danish migrant Else Christensen in 1969. HistoryÁsatrú grew steadily in the United States during the 1960s. 

Ansible<====>2106<====>Ansible An ansible is a category of fictional device or technology capable of instantaneous or faster-than-light communication.  It can send and receive messages to and from a corresponding device over any distance or obstacle whatsoever with no delay.  The term ansible is broadly shared across works of several science fiction authors, settings and continuities. OriginUrsula K.  Le Guin coined the word ansible in her 1966 novel Rocannon's World.   The word is a contraction of "answerable", as the device would allow its users to receive answers to their messages in a reasonable amount of time, even over interstellar distances. 

Adalbert of Prague<====>2108<====>Adalbert of Prague  Adalbert of Prague ( ;   956 23 April 997), known in Czech by his birth name Vojtěch ( ), was a Bohemian missionary and Christian saint.  He was the Bishop of Prague and a missionary to the Hungarians, Poles, and Prussians, who was martyred in his efforts to convert the Baltic Prussians to Christianity.  St. Adalbert is assumed to be the author of the oldest Czech hymn Hospodine, pomiluj ny  , unique also because it is commonly sung also today and he was said also to be the composer of Bogurodzica, the oldest known Polish hymn, but this is now thought unlikely, as he did not know the language. 

Ælfheah of Canterbury<====>2110<====>Ælfheah of Canterbury  Ælfheah   (c.  953 – 19 April 1012) was an Anglo-Saxon Bishop of Winchester, later Archbishop of Canterbury.   He became an anchorite before being elected abbot of Bath Abbey.  His reputation for piety and sanctity led to his promotion to the episcopate, and eventually, to his becoming archbishop.  Ælfheah furthered the cult of Dunstan and also encouraged learning.   He was captured by Viking raiders in 1011 and killed by them the following year after refusing to allow himself to be ransomed.   Ælfheah was canonised as a saint in 1078. 

Associative algebra<====>2112<====>Associative algebra In mathematics, an associative algebra is an algebraic structure with compatible operations of addition, multiplication (assumed to be associative), and a scalar multiplication by elements in some field.  The addition and multiplication operations together give A the structure of a ring; the addition and scalar multiplication operations together give A the structure of a vector space over K.  In this article we will also use the term K-algebra to mean an associative algebra over the field K.  A standard first example of a K-algebra is a ring of square matrices over a field K, with the usual matrix multiplication. 

Axiom of regularity<====>2113<====>Axiom of regularityIn mathematics, the axiom of regularity (also known as the axiom of foundation) is an axiom of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory that states that every non-empty set A contains an element that is disjoint from A.  In first-order logic, the axiom reads: \forall   x\,(x \neq   \varnothing   \Rightarrow   \exists   y \in x\,(y \cap x = \varnothing)) as in ZF there are no Urelements.   In a set theory with Urelements, such as ZFA or ZFCA, the proposition "x ≠ ∅" has to be replaced by "x is an inhabited set":  \forall x\,( \exists z \, ( z \in x ) \Rightarrow   \exists   y \in x\,(y \cap x = \varnothing)) . 

IBM AIX<====>2114<====>IBM AIX    AIX (Advanced Interactive eXecutive, pronounced   ) is a series of proprietary Unix operating systems developed and sold by IBM for several of its computer platforms.

AIX is based on UNIX System V with 4. 3BSD-compatible extensions.   It is one of six commercial operating systems that have versions certified to The Open Group's UNIX 03 standard (the others being macOS, Solaris, Inspur K-UX, HP-UX, and eulerOS ). 

AppleTalk<====>2115<====>AppleTalk  AppleTalk was a proprietary suite of networking protocols developed by Apple Inc.  for their Macintosh computers.  AppleTalk includes a number of features that allow local area networks to be connected with no prior setup or the need for a centralized router or server of any sort.  Connected AppleTalk-equipped systems automatically assign addresses, update the distributed namespace, and configure any required inter-networking routing. AppleTalk was released in 1985, and was the primary protocol used by Apple devices through the 1980s and 1990s.  Versions were also released for the IBM PC and compatibles and the Apple IIGS. 

Apple II series<====>2116<====>Apple II series  The Apple II series (trademarked with square brackets as "Apple ][" and rendered on later models as "Apple //") is a family of home computers, one of the first highly successful mass-produced text command microcomputer products,  designed primarily by Steve Wozniak, manufactured by Apple Computer (now Apple Inc. ) and introduced in 1977 with the original Apple II.  In terms of ease of use, features and expandability, the Apple II was a major technological advancement over its predecessor, the Apple I, a limited-production bare circuit board computer for electronics hobbyists that pioneered many features that made the Apple II a commercial success. 

Apple III<====>2117<====>Apple III  The Apple III (often styled as apple ///) is a business-oriented personal computer produced and released by Apple Computer in 1980.

AVL tree<====>2118<====>AVL tree  In computer science, an AVL tree (named after inventors Adelson-Velsky and Landis) is a self-balancing binary search tree.  It was the first such data structure to be invented.   In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.  Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take   time in both the average and worst cases, where   is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation. 

Aliphatic compound<====>2120<====>Aliphatic compound In organic chemistry, hydrocarbons (compounds composed of carbon and hydrogen) are divided into two classes: aromatic compounds and aliphatic compounds ( ; G.  aleiphar, fat, oil) also known as non-aromatic compounds.  Aliphatics can be cyclic, but only aromatic compounds contain an especially stable ring of atoms, such as benzene.    Aliphatic compounds can be saturated, like hexane, or unsaturated, like hexene and hexyne.  Open-chain compounds (whether straight or branched) contain no rings of any type, and are thus aliphatic. StructureAliphatic compounds can be saturated, joined by single bonds (alkanes), or unsaturated, with double bonds (alkenes) or triple bonds (alkynes). 

Astrology<====>2122<====>Astrology   Astrology is the study of the movements and relative positions of celestial objects as a means for divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events.Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications.Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some – such as the Indians, Chinese, and Maya – developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. 

Algebraic extension<====>2125<====>Algebraic extension In abstract algebra, a field extension L/K is called algebraic if every element of L is algebraic over K, i. e.  if every element of L is a root of some non-zero polynomial with coefficients in K.  Field extensions that are not algebraic, i. e.  which contain transcendental elements, are called transcendental. For example, the field extension R/Q, that is the field of real numbers as an extension of the field of rational numbers, is transcendental, while the field extensions C/R and Q(√2)/Q are algebraic, where C is the field of complex numbers. All transcendental extensions are of infinite degree.

Aesthetics<====>2130<====>Aesthetics    Aesthetics (  or  ; also spelled esthetics) is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature of art, beauty, and taste, with the creation and appreciation of beauty.   In its more technically epistemological perspective, it is defined as the study of subjective and sensori-emotional values, sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste.   Aesthetics studies how artists imagine, create and perform works of art; how people use, enjoy, and criticize art; and what happens in their minds when they look at paintings, listen to music, or read poetry, and understand what they see and hear. 

Ark of the Covenant<====>2134<====>Ark of the Covenant The Ark of the Covenant ( ), also known as the Ark of the Testimony, is a gold-covered wooden chest with lid cover described in the Book of Exodus as containing the two stone tablets of the Ten Commandments.  According to various texts within the Hebrew Bible, it also contained Aaron's rod and a pot of manna.  The biblical account relates that, approximately one year after the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, the Ark was created according to the pattern given to Moses by God when the Israelites were encamped at the foot of biblical Mount Sinai. 

Angles<====>2136<====>Angles   The Angles ( ) were one of the main Germanic peoples who settled in Great Britain in the post-Roman period.  They founded several of the kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England, and their name is the root of the name England.  The name comes from Anglia (Angeln), a peninsula located on the Baltic shore of what is now Schleswig-Holstein. NameThe name of the Angles may have been first recorded in Latinised form, as Anglii, in the Germania of Tacitus.  It is thought to derive from the name of the area they originally inhabited, the Anglia Peninsula (Angeln in modern German, Angel in Danish). 

Aster CT-80<====>2137<====>Aster CT-80The Aster CT-80, an early (1982) home/personal computer developed by the small Dutch company MCP (later renamed to Aster Computers), was sold in its first incarnation as a kit for hobbyists.  Later it was sold ready to use.  It consisted of several Eurocard PCB's with DIN 41612 connectors, and a backplane all based on a 19-inch rack configuration.  It was the first commercially available Dutch personal/home computer.   The Aster computer could use the software written for the popular Tandy TRS-80 computer while fixing many of the problems of that computer, but it could also run CP/M software, with a big amount of free memory Transient Program Area, (TPA) and a full 80×25 display, and it could be used as a Videotext terminal.

Armour<====>2147<====>Armour    Armour (British English or Canadian English) or armor (American English; see spelling differences) is a protective covering that is used to prevent damage from being inflicted to an object, individual or vehicle by direct contact weapons or projectiles, usually during combat, or from damage caused by a potentially dangerous environment or action (e. g. , cycling, construction sites, etc. ). Personal armour is used to protect soldiers and war animals.  Vehicle armour is used on warships and armoured fighting vehicles. 

Armoured fighting vehicle<====>2148<====>Armoured fighting vehicle   An armoured fighting vehicle (AFV) is an armed combat vehicle protected by armour, generally combining operational mobility with tactical offensive and defensive capabilities.  AFVs can be wheeled or tracked.  Tanks, armoured cars, armoured self-propelled guns, and armoured personnel carriers are all examples of AFVs.  AFVs in general are commonly referred to as "armour". The concept of a highly mobile and protected fighting unit has been around for centuries; from Hannibal's war elephants to Leonardo's war machines, military strategists endeavoured to maximize the mobility and survivability of their soldiers.  Armoured fighting vehicles are classified according to their intended role on the battlefield and characteristics. 

Anton Drexler<====>2151<====>Anton Drexler Anton Drexler (13 June 1884 – 24 February 1942) was a German far-right political leader of the 1920s who was instrumental in the formation of the pan-German and anti-Semitic German Workers' Party (Deutsche Arbeiterpartei – DAP), the antecedent of the Nazi Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei – NSDAP).  Drexler served as mentor to Adolf Hitler during his early days in politics. Early lifeBorn in Munich, Drexler was a machine-fitter before becoming a railway toolmaker and locksmith in Berlin.   He joined the Fatherland Party during World War I.   PoliticsEarly involvement in politicsIn March 1918 Drexler founded a branch of Der Freie Arbeiterausschuss für einen guten Frieden (Free Workers' Committee for a Good Peace) league. 

All Quiet on the Western Front<====>2152<====>All Quiet on the Western Front   All Quiet on the Western Front ( ) is a novel by Erich Maria Remarque, a German veteran of World War I.  The book describes the German soldiers' extreme physical and mental stress during the war, and the detachment from civilian life felt by many of these soldiers upon returning home from the front. The novel was first published in November and December 1928 in the German newspaper Vossische Zeitung and in book form in late January 1929.  The book and its sequel, The Road Back (1930), were among the books banned and burned in Nazi Germany. 

African Americans<====>2154<====>African Americans    African Americans (also referred to as Black Americans or Afro-Americans ) are an ethnic group of Americans with total or partial ancestry from any of the black racial groups of Africa.    This term may also be used to include only those individuals who are descended from enslaved Africans.   As a compound adjective, the term is usually hyphenated as  .   Black and African Americans constitute the third largest racial and ethnic group in the United States (after White Americans and Hispanic and Latino Americans). 

Artistic License<====>2161<====>Artistic License  The Artistic License (version 1. 0) is a software license used for certain free and open-source software packages, most notably the standard implementation of the Perl programming language and most CPAN modules, which are dual-licensed under the Artistic License and the GNU General Public License (GPL). HistoryArtistic License 1. 0The original Artistic License was written by Larry Wall.  The name of the license is a reference to the concept of artistic license. Whether or not the original Artistic License is a free software license is largely unsettled.  The Free Software Foundation explicitly called the original Artistic License a non-free license,  criticizing it as being "too vague; some passages are too clever for their own good, and their meaning is not clear". 

Afrikaans<====>2162<====>Afrikaans  Afrikaans ( )   is a West Germanic language spoken in South Africa, Namibia and, to a lesser extent, Botswana and Zimbabwe.  It evolved from the Dutch vernacularof South Holland (Hollandic dialect)spoken by the mainly Dutch settlers of what is now South Africa, where it gradually began to develop distinguishing characteristics in the course of the 18th century.Hence, it is a daughter language of Dutch, and was previously referred to as "Cape Dutch" (a term also used to refer collectively to the early Cape settlers) or "kitchen Dutch" (a derogatory term used to refer to Afrikaans in its earlier days). 

Aeolus<====>2163<====>Aeolus In Greek mythology, Aeolus  ( ;  , Aiolos  , Modern Greek:   "quick-moving, nimble") is a name shared by three mythical characters.  These three personages are often difficult to tell apart, and even the ancient mythographers appear to have been perplexed about which Aeolus was which.  Diodorus Siculus made an attempt to define each of these three (although it is clear that he also became muddled), and his opinion is followed here.The first Aeolus was a son of Hellen and eponymous founder of the Aeolian race. The second Aeolus was a son of Poseidon, who led a colony to islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea.

Alford plea<====>2167<====>Alford pleaDISPLAYTITLEAn Alford plea (also called a Kennedy plea in West Virginia,  anAlford guilty plea,    and the Alford doctrine) in United States law is a guilty plea in criminal court,    whereby a defendant in a criminal case does not admit to the criminal act and asserts innocence. In entering an Alford plea, the defendant admits that the evidence the prosecution has would be likely to persuade a judge or jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 

Anti-realism<====>2171<====>Anti-realism In analytic philosophy, anti-realism is an epistemological position first articulated by British philosopher Michael Dummett.  The term was coined as an argument against a form of realism Dummett saw as 'colorless reductionism'.  In anti-realism, the truth of a statement rests on its demonstrability through internal logic mechanisms, such as Frege's context principle and Heyting's intuitionistic logic, in direct opposition to the realist notion that the truth of a statement rests on its correspondence to an external, independent reality.    In anti-realism, this external reality is hypothetical and is not assumed.   Because it encompasses statements containing abstract ideal objects (i.

It has won the second-most top flight matches in English football history,    and is the only English club to go a 38-match league season unbeaten. Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join The Football League, in 1893, and they reached the First Division in 1904. 

Cuisine of the United States<====>2175<====>Cuisine of the United States The cuisine of the United States reflects its history.  The European colonization of the Americas yielded the introduction of a number of ingredients and cooking styles to the latter.  The various styles continued expanding well into the 19th and 20th centuries, proportional to the influx of immigrants from many different nations; such influx developed a rich diversity in food preparation throughout the country. Early Native Americans utilized a number of cooking methods in early American Cuisine that have been blended with early European cooking methods to form the basis of American Cuisine. 

Ahmad Shah Massoud<====>2176<====>Ahmad Shah Massoud  Ahmad Shah Massoud (Dari Persian:  ;  September 2, 1953  September 9, 2001) was an Afghan political and military leader.  He was a powerful military commander during the resistance against the Soviet occupation between 1979 and 1989.  From 1992 he led the government's military wing as he defended Kabul from rival militias attacking the city.  After 1996 he was the only remaining opposition commander against the totalitarean Taliban regime,  which he fought against until his assassination on September 9, 2001.  Massoud managed to defend his local Panjshir Valley from being taken by the Soviets and thereafter by the Taliban. 

Atlantis<====>2178<====>Atlantis    Atlantis ( , "island of Atlas") is a fictional island mentioned within an allegory on the hubris of nations in Plato's works Timaeus and Critias, where it represents the antagonist naval power that besieges "Ancient Athens", the pseudo-historic embodiment of Plato's ideal state (see The Republic).  In the story, Athens repels the Atlantean attack unlike any other nation of the (western) known world,  supposedly giving testament to the superiority of Plato's concept of a state.   The story concludes with Atlantis falling out of favor with the deities and submerging into the Atlantic Ocean. 

Autobiography<====>2179<====>Autobiography An autobiography (from the Greek, αὐτός-autos self +  βίος-bios life + γράφειν-graphein to write) is a self-written account of the life of oneself .  The word "autobiography" was first used deprecatingly by William Taylor in 1797 in the English periodical The Monthly Review, when he suggested the word as a hybrid, but condemned it as "pedantic".  However, its next recorded use was in its present sense, by Robert Southey in 1809.   Despite only being named early in the nineteenth century, first-person autobiographical writing originates in antiquity.  Roy Pascal differentiates autobiography from the periodic self-reflective mode of journal or diary writing by noting that "[autobiography] is a review of a life from a particular moment in time, while the diary, however reflective it may be, moves through a series of moments in time". 

Arcadius<====>2180<====>Arcadius   Arcadius ( ;  ; 1 January 377 – 1 May 408) was Byzantine Emperor from 395 to 408.  He was the eldest son of Theodosius I and his first wife Aelia Flaccilla, and brother of the Western Emperor Honorius.  A weak ruler, his reign was dominated by a series of powerful ministers and by his wife, Aelia Eudoxia.  HistoryArcadius was born in Hispania, the elder son of Theodosius I and Aelia Flaccilla, and brother of Honorius, who would become a Western Roman Emperor.  His father declared him an Augustus and co-ruler for the Eastern half of the Empire in January 383. 

Arabs<====>2185<====>Arabs   Arabs ( ;ISO 233   ,  Arabic pronunciation   ) are a population inhabiting the Arab world.  They primarily live in the Arab states in Western Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa and western Indian Ocean islands.   They also form a significant  diaspora, with Arab communities established around the world.  The Arabs are first mentioned in the mid-ninth century BC as tribal people in eastern and southern Syria, and the north of the Arabian Peninsula.   The Arabs appear to have been under the vassalage of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–612 BC), and the succeeding Neo-Babylonian (626–539 BC), Achaemenid (539–332 BC), Seleucid and Parthian empires. 

Armadillo<====>2186<====>Armadillo   Armadillos are New World placental mammals in the order Cingulata with a leathery armour shell.  The Chlamyphoridae and Dasypodidae are the only surviving families in the order, which is part of the superorder Xenarthra, along with the anteaters and sloths.  The word armadillo means "little armoured one" in Spanish.  The Aztecs called them āyōtōchtli  , Nahuatl for "turtle-rabbit": āyōtl   (turtle) and tōchtli   (rabbit).

Arcology<====>2193<====>Arcology Arcology, a portmanteau of "architecture" and "ecology",  .   is a field of creating architectural design principles for very densely populated, ecologically low-impact human habitats. The concept has been primarily popularized, and the term itself coined, by architect Paolo Soleri.  It also appears in science fiction.  Authors such as Peter Hamilton in Neutronium Alchemist or Paolo Bacigalupi in The Water Knife explicitly use arcologies as part of their scenarios.  Arcologies are often portrayed in science fiction as self-contained or economically self-sufficient. These structures have been largely hypothetical insofar as no arcology, even one envisioned by Soleri himself, has yet been completed, but he posited that a completed arcology would provide space for a variety of residential, commercial, and agricultural facilities while minimizing individual human environmental impact.

Amstrad CPC<====>2197<====>Amstrad CPC  The Amstrad CPC (short for Colour Personal Computer) is a series of 8-bit home computers produced by Amstrad between 1984 and 1990.  It was designed to compete in the mid-1980s home computer market dominated by the Commodore 64 and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, where it successfully established itself primarily in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and the German-speaking parts of Europe. The series spawned a total of six distinct models: The CPC464, CPC664, and CPC6128 were highly successful competitors in the European home computer market.  The later plus models, 464plus and 6128plus, efforts to prolong the system's lifecycle with hardware updates, were considerably less successful, as was the attempt to repackage the plus hardware into a game console as the GX4000.

Omari arrived in the United States in June 2001, on a tourist visa, obtained through the Visa Express program.  On September 11, 2001, Omari boarded American Airlines Flight 11 and assisted in the hijacking of the plane, which was crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, as part of the coordinated attacks. 

Aage Bohr<====>2201<====>Aage Bohr   Aage Niels Bohr ( ; 19 June 1922 – 8 September 2009) was a Danish nuclear physicist who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1975 with Ben Mottelson and James Rainwater "for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection".Starting from Rainwater's concept of an irregular-shaped liquid drop model of the nucleus, Bohr and Mottelson developed a detailed theory that was in close agreement with experiments.  Since his father, Niels Bohr, had won the prize in 1922, he and his father were one of the six pairs of fathers and sons who have both won the Nobel Prize and one of the four pairs who have both won the Nobel Prize in Physics. 

Analytic geometry<====>2202<====>Analytic geometry  In classical mathematics, analytic geometry, also known as coordinate geometry or Cartesian geometry, is the study of geometry using a coordinate system.  This contrasts with synthetic geometry. Analytic geometry is widely used in physics and engineering, and also in aviation, rocketry, space science, and spaceflight.  It is the foundation of most modern fields of geometry, including algebraic, differential, discrete and computational geometry. Usually the Cartesian coordinate system is applied to manipulate equations for planes, straight lines, and squares, often in two and sometimes in three dimensions.  Geometrically, one studies the Euclidean plane (two dimensions) and Euclidean space (three dimensions). 

Arabic alphabet<====>2204<====>Arabic alphabet    The Arabic alphabet (   , or    ) or Arabic abjad is the Arabic script as it is codified for writing the Arabic language.  It is written from right to left in a cursive style and includes 28 letters. Originally, the alphabet was an abjad, with only consonants, but it is now considered an "impure abjad".  As with other abjads, such as the Hebrew alphabet, scribes later devised means of indicating vowel sounds by separate vowel points.  ConsonantsThe basic Arabic alphabet contains 28 letters.  Adaptations of the Arabic script for other languages added and removed some letters, as for Kurdish, Persian, Ottoman Turkish, Sindhi, Urdu, Malay, Pashto, Arwi and Malayalam (Arabi Malayalam), all of which have additional letters as shown below. 

Angels in art<====>2207<====>Angels in art Angels have appeared in works of art since early Christian art, and they have been a popular subject for Byzantine and European paintings and sculpture. Angels are usually intended, in both Christian and Islamic art, to be beautiful, though several depictions go for more awesome/frightening attributes, notably in the depiction of the living creatures (which have beastial characteristics), ophanim (which are unanthropomorphic wheels) and cherubim (which have mosaic features);  As a matter of theology, they are spiritual beings who do not eat or excrete and are genderless.  Many angels in art may appear to the modern eye to be gendered as either male or female by their dress or actions, but until the 19th century, even the most female looking will normally lack breasts, and the figures should normally be considered as genderless. 

Arctic fox<====>2208<====>Arctic fox    The Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), also known as the white fox, polar fox, or snow fox, is a small fox native to the Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere and common throughout the Arctic tundra biome. It is well adapted to living in cold environments, and is best known for its thick, warm fur that is also used as camouflage.  On average, Arctic foxes only live 3-4 years in the wild.   Its body length ranges from  , with a generally rounded body shape to minimize the escape of body heat. 

Folklore of the United States<====>2210<====>Folklore of the United States  Folklore consists of legends, music, oral history, proverbs, jokes, popular beliefs, fairy tales, stories, tall tales, and customs that are the traditions of a culture, subculture, or group.  It is also the set of practices through which those expressive genres are shared.  The study of folklore is sometimes called folkloristics.  In usage, there is a continuum between folklore and mythology. American folklore encompasses the folk traditions that have evolved on the North American continent since Europeans arrived in the 16th century.  While it contains much in the way of Native American tradition, it should not be confused with the tribal beliefs of any community of native people. 

Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri<====>2215<====>Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri is a video game in the 4X genre which is considered a spiritual sequel to the Civilization series.  Set in a science fiction depiction of the 22nd century, the game begins as seven competing ideological factions land on the planet Chiron ("Planet") in the Alpha Centauri star system.  As the game progresses, Planet's growing sentience becomes a formidable obstacle to the human colonists. Sid Meier, designer of Civilization, and Brian Reynolds, designer of Civilization II, developed Alpha Centauri after they left MicroProse to join the newly created developer Firaxis Games. 

Abu Sayyaf<====>2216<====>Abu SayyafAbu Sayyaf (   ;  ;  , ASG;  ),  unofficially known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Philippines Province, is a Jihadist militant group that follows the Wahhabi doctrine of Sunni Islam based in and around Jolo and Basilan islands in the southwestern part of the Philippines, where for more than four decades, Moro groups have been engaged in an insurgency for an independent province in the country.  The group is considered violent,    and was responsible for the Philippines' worst terrorist attack, the bombing of Superferry 14 in 2004, which killed 116 people. 

Armenian language<====>2217<====>Armenian language The Armenian language (classical:  ; reformed: ) occupies an independent branch of the Indo-European language tree.   It is the official language of the Republic of Armenia and the Republic of Artsakh.   It has historically been spoken throughout the Armenian Highlands and today is widely spoken in the Armenian diaspora.  Armenian is written using the Armenian alphabet, introduced in AD 405 by Mesrop Mashtots. Armenian has developed since the separation from Indo-European mother tongue in the third millennium BC to at least the time of the first Armenian dynasty (the Yervanduni dynasty, founded in the 6th century BC). 

Additive synthesis<====>2218<====>Additive synthesis  Additive synthesis is a sound synthesis technique that creates timbre by adding sine waves together.  The timbre of musical instruments can be considered in the light of Fourier theory to consist of multiple harmonic or inharmonic partials or overtones.  Each partial is a sine wave of different frequency and amplitude that swells and decays over time due to modulation from an ADSR envelope or low frequency oscillator. Additive synthesis most directly generates sound by adding the output of multiple sine wave generators.  Alternative implementations may use pre-computed wavetables or the inverse Fast Fourier transform. 

Aircraft carrier<====>2219<====>Aircraft carrierAn aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft.   Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations.  Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft.  Whilst heavier aircraft such as fixed-wing gunships and bombers have been launched from aircraft carriers, it is currently not possible to land them. 

Apicomplexa<====>2221<====>Apicomplexa The Apicomplexa (also called Apicomplexia) are a large phylum of parasitic alveolates.  Most of them possess a unique form of organelle that comprises a type of plastid called an apicoplast, and an apical complex structure.  The organelle is an adaptation that the apicomplexan applies in penetration of a host cell. The Apicomplexa are unicellular and spore-forming.   All species are obligate endoparasites of animals,  except Nephromyces, a symbiont in marine animals, originally classified as a chytrid fungus.   Motile structures such as flagella or pseudopods are present only in certain gamete stages. The Apicomplexa are a diverse group that includes organisms such as the coccidia, gregarines, piroplasms, haemogregarines, and plasmodia. 

Argentine cuisine<====>2222<====>Argentine cuisine   Argentine cuisine is described as a cultural blending of  Mediterranean influences (such as those created by Italian and Spanish populations) with and very small inflows (mainly in border areas), Indigenous, within the wide scope of  agricultural products that are abundant in the country.  Argentine annual consumption of beef has averaged 100 kg (220 lbs) per capita,  approaching 180 kg (396 lbs) per capita during the 19th century; consumption averaged 67. 7 kg (149 lbs) in 2007.   Beyond asado (the Argentine barbecue), no other dish more genuinely matches the national identity.  Nevertheless, the country's vast area, and its cultural diversity, have led to a local cuisine of various dishes.

He is succeeded by his Praetorian Guard prefect, Marcus Opellius Macrinus. 632 – King Charibert II is assassinated at Blaye (Gironde), along with his infant son Chilperic. 876 – The Battle of Dayr al-'Aqul saves Baghdad from the Saffarids. 1093 – The new Winchester Cathedral is dedicated by Walkelin. 1139 – Roger II of Sicily is excommunicated. 1149 – Pope Eugene III takes refuge in the castle of Ptolemy II of Tusculum. 1232 – Mongol–Jin War: The Mongols begin their siege on Kaifeng, the capital of the Jin dynasty. 

Ad hominem<====>2226<====>Ad hominem  Ad hominem (Latin for "to the man" or "to the person" ), short for argumentum ad hominem, is a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby an argument is rebutted by attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.  However, its original meaning was an argument "calculated to appeal to the person addressed more than to impartial reason".  Fallacious ad hominem reasoning is categorized as an informal fallacy, more precisely as a genetic fallacy, a subcategory of fallacies of irrelevance. 

Analysis of algorithms<====>2230<====>Analysis of algorithms  In computer science, the analysis of algorithms is the determination of the computational complexity of algorithms, that is the amount of time, storage and/or other resources necessary to execute them.  Usually, this involves determining a function that relates the length of an algorithm's input to the number of steps it takes (its time complexity) or the number of storage locations it uses (its space complexity).  An algorithm is said to be efficient when this function's values are small. Since different inputs of the same length may cause the algorithm to have different behavior, the function describing its performance is usually an upper bound on the actual performance, determined from the worst case inputs to the algorithm. 

Ælle of Sussex<====>2233<====>Ælle of Sussex  Ælle (also Aelle or Ella) is recorded in early sources as the first king of the South Saxons, reigning in what is now called Sussex, England, from 477 to perhaps as late as 514.  According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Ælle and three of his sons are said to have landed at a place called Cymensora and fought against the local Britons.   The chronicle goes on to report a victory in 491, at present day Pevensey, where the battle ended with the Saxons slaughtering their opponents to the last man. Ælle was the first king recorded by the 8th century chronicler Bede to have held "imperium", or overlordship, over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. 

Atari<====>2234<====>Atari   Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA).    The original Atari, Inc. , founded in Sunnyvale, California in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers.  The company's products, such as Pong and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. In 1984, the original Atari Inc.  was split due to its role in the video game crash of 1983, and the arcade division was turned into Atari Games Inc. 

Afghan<====>2235<====>Afghan Afghan (also referred to as Afghanistani) (Pashto/ ; see etymology) refers to someone or something from Afghanistan, in particular a citizen of that country.    Prior to the rise of the nation as Afghanistan, it was used by Persian speakers and those influenced by the Persian language to denote the Pashtun people.  In modern times, "Afghan" is rarely used as an ethnic term for the Pashtuns, but is rather used as the national demonym for all citizens of Afghanistan   — Pashtuns, and a large number of Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks, Aimaqs, Turkmens, Balochs, Nuristanis, Pashayis, Pamiris, Arabs, and others. 

Acadia University<====>2236<====>Acadia University   Acadia University is a predominantly undergraduate university located in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada with some graduate programs at the master's level  and one at the doctoral level.

The student-faculty ratio is 15:1 and the average class size is 28. 

Steel-string acoustic guitar<====>2237<====>Steel-string acoustic guitar  The steel-string acoustic guitar is a modern form of guitar that descends from the nylon-strung classical guitar, but is strung with steel strings for a brighter, louder sound.  Like the classical guitar, it is often referred to simply as an acoustic guitar. The most common type is often called a flat top guitar, to distinguish it from the more specialized archtop guitar and other variations. The standard tuning for an acoustic guitar is E-A-D-G-B-E (low to high), although many players, particularly fingerpickers, use alternate tunings (scordatura), such as "open G" (D-G-D-G-B-D), "open D" (D-A-D-F -A-D), or "drop D" (D-A-D-G-B-E). 

Antipope John XXIII<====>2238<====>Antipope John XXIIIBaldassarre Cossa (c.  1370 – 22 December 1419) was Pisan antipope John XXIII (1410–1415) during the Western Schism.  The Catholic Church regards him as an antipope, as he opposed the Pope whom the Catholic Church now recognizes as the rightful successor of Saint Peter.  He was eventually deposed and tried for various crimes, though later accounts question the veracity of those accusations. Early lifeBaldassarre Cossa was born on the island of Procida or in the Kingdom of Naples to the family of Giovanni Cossa, lord of Procida.  Initially he followed a military career, taking part in the Angevin-Neapolitan war. 

Antonio Salieri<====>2241<====>Antonio Salieri Antonio Salieri ( ; 18 August 1750 7 May 1825) was an Italian  classical composer, conductor, and teacher.  He was born in Legnago, south of Verona, in the Republic of Venice, and spent his adult life and career as a subject of the Habsburg Monarchy.  Salieri is known for his rivalry with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and the rumor that he poisoned the composer. Salieri was a pivotal figure in the development of late 18th-century opera.  As a student of Florian Leopold Gassmann, and a protégé of Christoph Willibald Gluck, Salieri was a cosmopolitan composer who wrote operas in three languages. 

Cobble Hill Tunnel<====>2244<====>Cobble Hill Tunnel   The Cobble Hill Tunnel (popularly the Atlantic Avenue Tunnel) of the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) is an abandoned railroad tunnel beneath Atlantic Avenue in downtown Brooklyn, New York City.  When open, it ran for about   between Columbia Street and Boerum Place.   It is the oldest railway tunnel beneath a city street in North America that was fully devoted to rail.    Construction and operationOriginally built as an open cutting, construction began in May 1844, and opened for use on December 3, 1844, but was not completely finished until late Spring 1845. 

Annapolis Valley<====>2245<====>Annapolis Valley   The Annapolis Valley is a valley and region in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.  It is located in the western part of the Nova Scotia peninsula, formed by a trough between two parallel mountain ranges along the shore of the Bay of Fundy.  Statistics Canada defines the Annapolis Valley as an economic region, composed of Annapolis County, Kings County, and Hants County. Geography The valley measures approximately   in length from Digby and the Annapolis Basin in the west to Wolfville and the Minas Basin in the east, spanning the counties of Digby, Annapolis and Kings. 

Analgesic<====>2246<====>Analgesic An analgesic or painkiller is any member of the group of drugs used to achieve analgesia, relief from pain. Analgesic drugs act in various ways on the peripheral and central nervous systems.   They are distinct from anesthetics, which temporarily affect, and in some instances completely eliminate,  sensation.  Analgesics include paracetamol (known in North America as acetaminophen or simply APAP), the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as the salicylates, and opioid drugs such as morphine and oxycodone. When choosing analgesics, the severity and response to other medication determines the choice of agent; the World Health Organization (WHO) pain ladder  specifies mild analgesics as its first step. 

Abiotic stress<====>2250<====>Abiotic stressAbiotic stress is defined as the negative impact of non-living factors on the living organisms in a specific environment.    The non-living variable must influence the environment beyond its normal range of variation to adversely affect the population performance or individual physiology of the organism in a significant way.    Whereas a biotic stress would include such living disturbances as fungi or harmful insects, abiotic stress factors, or stressors, are naturally occurring, often intangible, factors such as intense sunlight or wind that may cause harm to the plants and animals in the area affected.  Abiotic stress is essentially unavoidable. 

Accusative case<====>2251<====>Accusative caseThe accusative case (abbreviated  ) of a noun is the grammatical case used to mark the direct object of a transitive verb.  The same case is used in many languages for the objects of (some or all) prepositions.   It is a noun that is having something done to it, usually used together (such as in Latin) with the nominative case.  For example, "they" in English is nominative; "them" is accusative.  The sentence "They like them" shows the nominative case and accusative case working in conjunction using the same base word.  The syntactic functions of the accusative consist of designating the immediate object of an action, the intended result, the goal of a motion, and the extent of an action. 

Apostolic succession<====>2257<====>Apostolic succession Apostolic succession is the method whereby the ministry of the Christian Church is held to be derived from the apostles by a continuous succession, which has usually been associated with a claim that the succession is through a series of bishops.  F. L.  Cross, E. A.  Livingstone (editors), The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005  ), article "apostolic succession"  This series was seen originally as that of the bishops of a particular see founded by one or more of the apostles.  According to historian Justo L.  González, apostolic succession is generally understood today as meaning a series of bishops, regardless of see, each consecrated by other bishops, themselves consecrated similarly in a succession going back to the apostles. 

Ascorbic acid (molecular aspects)<====>2268<====>Ascorbic acid (molecular aspects)  Ascorbic acid is a naturally occurring organic compound with antioxidant properties.  It is a white solid, but impure samples can appear yellowish.   It dissolves well in water to give mildly acidic solutions.  Ascorbic acid is one form ("vitamer") of vitamin C.  It was originally called  L -hexuronic acid, but, when it was found to have vitamin C activity in animals ("vitamin C" being defined as a vitamin activity, not then a specific substance), the suggestion was made to rename it.  The new name, ascorbic acid, is derived from a- (meaning "no") and scorbutus (scurvy), the disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin C. 

AFC Ajax<====>2273<====>AFC AjaxAmsterdamsche Football Club Ajax ( ), also AFC Ajax, Ajax Amsterdam or simply Ajax, is a Dutch professional football club based in Amsterdam.  Historically, Ajax (named after the legendary Greek hero) has been the most successful club in the Netherlands, with 33 Eredivisie titles and 18 KNVB Cups.  It has continuously played in the Eredivisie, the Dutch football top division, since its inception in 1956 and, along with Feyenoord and PSV, it is one of the country's "big three" clubs that have dominated that competition. Ajax has historically been one of the most successful clubs in the world. 

Arthur Eddington<====>2274<====>Arthur Eddington   Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington (28 December 1882 – 22 November 1944) was an English astronomer, physicist, and mathematician of the early 20th century who did his greatest work in astrophysics.  He was also a philosopher of science and a populariser of science.  The Eddington limit, the natural limit to the luminosity of stars, or the radiation generated by accretion onto a compact object, is named in his honour. Around 1920, he anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in stars, in his paper The Internal Constitution of the Stars. 

Apple II<====>2275<====>Apple II  The Apple II (stylized as Apple ][) is an 8-bit home computer, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products,  designed primarily by Steve Wozniak (Steve Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II's foam-molded plastic case    and Rod Holt developed the switching power supply).It was introduced in 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire by Jobs and was the first consumer product sold by Apple Computer, Inc.  It is the first model in a series of computers which were produced until Apple IIe production ceased in November 1993.

Alexis Korner<====>2282<====>Alexis Korner   Alexis Andrew Nicholas Koerner (19 April 1928 – 1 January 1984) was a British blues musician and radio broadcaster, who has sometimes been referred to as "a founding father of British blues".   A major influence on the sound of the British music scene in the 1960s,  Korner was instrumental in bringing together various English blues musicians. Early careerKoerner was born in Paris, to an Austrian Jewish father and a Greek mother.    He spent his childhood in France, Switzerland and North Africa and arrived in London in 1940 at the start of World War II. 

Assault gun<====>2284<====>Assault gun  An assault gun is a form of self-propelled artillery    which utilizes an infantry support gun mounted on a motorized chassis, normally an armored fighting vehicle.Assault guns are designed to provide direct fire support for infantry attacks, especially against other infantry or fortified positions.The term is a literal translation of the German word Sturmgeschütz, which was applied to the first purpose-built assault gun, the StuG III, in 1940.  Historically, the concept of assault guns was very similar to that of the infantry tank, as both were combat vehicles intended to accompany infantry formations into battle. 

Tank destroyer<====>2286<====>Tank destroyer   A tank destroyer or tank hunter is a type of armoured fighting vehicle, armed with a direct-fire artillery gun or missile launcher, with limited operational capacities and designed specifically to engage enemy tanks. Tanks are armoured fighting vehicles designed for front-line combat, combining operational mobility and tactical offensive and defensive capabilities; tanks perform all primary tasks of the armoured troops.  The tank destroyer on the other hand is specifically designed to take on enemy tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles.   Many are based on a tracked tank chassis, while others are wheeled. Since World War II, gun-armed tank destroyers have fallen out of favor as armies have favored multirole main battle tanks. 

Armored car (military)<====>2287<====>Armored car (military) A military armored (or armoured) car is a lightweight wheeled armored fighting vehicle, historically employed for reconnaissance, internal security, armed escort, and other subordinate battlefield tasks.With the gradual decline of mounted cavalry, armored cars were developed for carrying out duties formerly assigned to horsemen.Following the invention of the tank, the armored car remained popular due to its comparatively simplified maintenance and low production cost.  It also found favor with several colonial armies as a cheaper weapon for use in underdeveloped regions.During World War II, most armored cars were engineered for reconnaissance and passive observation, while others were devoted to communications tasks. 

Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon<====>2288<====>Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon   An anti-aircraft vehicle, also known as a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun (SPAAG) or self-propelled air defense system (SPAD), is a mobile vehicle with a dedicated anti-aircraft capability.  The Russian equivalent of SPAAG is ZSU, for zenitnaya samokhodnaya ustanovka, ("anti-aircraft self-propelled mount"). Specific weapon systems used include machine guns, autocannons, larger guns, or missiles, and some mount both guns and longer-ranged missiles (e. g.  the Pantsir-S1).  Platforms used include both trucks and heavier combat vehicles such as APCs and tanks, which add protection from aircraft, artillery, and small arms fire for front line deployment. 

AZ Alkmaar<====>2289<====>AZ Alkmaar    Alkmaar Zaanstreek ( ), better known as AZ Alkmaar or simply AZ ( ), is a Dutch professional football club from Alkmaar and the Zaanstreek.  The club plays in the Eredivisie, the highest professional football league in the Netherlands, and hosts home matches at the AFAS Stadion. AZ has won the Eredivisie twice, in 1980–81 and 2008–09.  In the same season as their first league title, they also reached the UEFA Cup Final, which they lost to Ipswich Town.  In addition, the team has won the KNVB Cup on four occasions. History1954–1972: Foundation and first yearsAZ was founded on 10 May 1967 as AZ '67, the result of a merger of Alkmaar '54 and FC Zaanstreek. 

Adrenal gland<====>2296<====>Adrenal gland  The adrenal glands (also known as suprarenal glands) are endocrine glands that produce a variety of hormones including adrenaline and the steroids aldosterone and cortisol.   They are found above the kidneys.  Each gland has an outer cortex which produces steroid hormones and an inner medulla.  The adrenal cortex itself is divided into three zones: zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis.  The adrenal cortex produces three main types of steroid hormones: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens.  Mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone) produced in the zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. 

American Media, Inc.<====>2299<====>American Media, Inc.   American Media, Inc. , is a publisher of magazines, supermarket tabloids, and books based in New York City. HistoryThe modern American Media came into being after Generoso Pope, Jr. , longtime owner of the National Enquirer, died in 1988, and his tabloids came under new ownership.  American tabloids began consolidating in 1990, when American Media bought Star from Rupert Murdoch.  The purchase of Globe Communications (owner of the Globe and the National Examiner) followed nine years later.  American Media is not to be confused with American Media Distribution the international news coverage firm. 

Aramaic language<====>2303<====>Aramaic language   Aramaic  (אַרָמָיָא Arāmāyā,  ,  ) is a language or group of languages belonging to the Semitic subfamily of the Afroasiatic language family.  More specifically, it is part of the Northwest Semitic group, which also includes the Canaanite languages such as Hebrew and Phoenician.  The Aramaic alphabet was widely adopted for other languages and is ancestral to the Hebrew, Syriac and Arabic alphabets. During its approximately 3100 years of written history,  Aramaic has served variously as a language of administration of empires and as a language of divine worship, religious study and as the spoken tongue of a number of Semitic peoples from the Near East. 

Saint Titus<====>2304<====>Saint Titus Titus ( ;  ) was an early Christian missionary and church leader, a companion and disciple of Paul the Apostle, mentioned in several of the Pauline epistles including the Epistle to Titus.  He is believed to be a Gentile converted to Christianity by Paul and, according to tradition, he was consecrated as Bishop of the Island of Crete.  Smith, William.  Smith’s Bible Dictionary 11th printing, November 1975.  New Jersey: Fleming H.  Revel Company.  pp.  701–02.  Titus brought a fundraising letter from Paul to Corinth, to collect for the poor in Jerusalem. 

Actinide<====>2308<====>Actinide  The actinide   or actinoid   (IUPAC nomenclature) series encompasses the 15 metallic chemical elements with atomic numbers from 89 to 103, actinium through lawrencium.  Strictly speaking, both actinium and lawrencium have been labeled as group 3 elements, but both elements are often included in any general discussion of the chemistry of the actinide elements.  Actinium is the more often omitted of the two, because its placement as a group 3 element is somewhat more common in texts and for semantic reasons: since "actinide" means "like actinium", it has been argued that actinium cannot logically be an actinide, even though IUPAC acknowledges its inclusion based on common usage. 

Arthur Miller<====>2310<====>Arthur Miller   Arthur Asher Miller (October 17, 1915 – February 10, 2005) was an American playwright, essayist, and figure in twentieth-century American theater.  Among his most popular plays are All My Sons (1947), Death of a Salesman (1949), The Crucible (1953) and A View from the Bridge (1955, revised 1956).  He also wrote several screenplays and was most noted for his work on The Misfits (1961).  The drama Death of a Salesman has been numbered on the short list of finest American plays in the 20th century alongside Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night and Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire.

August 10<====>2315<====>August 10 The term 'the 10th of August' is widely used by historians as a shorthand for the Storming of the Tuileries Palace on the 10th of August, 1792, the effective end of the French monarchy until it was restored in 1814. Events654 - Pope Eugene I elected to succeed Martinus I. 955 – Battle of Lechfeld: Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor defeats the Magyars, ending 50 years of Magyar invasion of the West. 991 – Battle of Maldon: The English, led by Byrhtnoth, Ealdorman of Essex, are defeated by a band of inland-raiding Vikings near Maldon, Essex. 

Audio file format<====>2316<====>Audio file formatAn audio file format is a file format for storing digital audio data on a computer system.  The bit layout of the audio data (excluding metadata) is called the audio coding format and can be uncompressed, or compressed to reduce the file size, often using lossy compression.  The data can be a raw bitstream in an audio coding format, but it is usually embedded in a container format or an audio data format with defined storage layer. Format typesIt is important to distinguish between the audio coding format, the container containing the raw audio data, and an audio codec.

According to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the correct names for the facility are Homey Airport    and Groom Lake,though the name Area 51 was used in a CIA document from the Vietnam War.    (the full declassified document is mirrored at Wikimedia Commons)  The facility has also been referred to as Dreamland and Paradise Ranch,among other nicknames. 

Audio signal processing<====>2322<====>Audio signal processing Audio signal processing or audio processing is the intentional alteration of audio signals often through an audio effect or effects unit.  As audio signals may be electronically represented in either digital or analog format, signal processing may occur in either domain.   Analog processors operate directly on the electrical signal, while digital processors operate mathematically on the digital representation of that signal. HistoryAudio signals are electronic representations of sound waves—longitudinal waves which travel through air, consisting of compressions and rarefactions.  The energy contained in audio signals is typically measured in decibels.  Audio processing was necessary for early radio broadcasting, as there were many problems with studio to transmitter links. 

Amdahl's law<====>2323<====>Amdahl's law In computer architecture, Amdahl's law (or Amdahl's argument ) is a formula which gives the theoretical speedup in latency of the execution of a task at fixed workload that can be expected of a system whose resources are improved.  It is named after computer scientist Gene Amdahl, and was presented at the AFIPS Spring Joint Computer Conference in 1967. Amdahl's law is often used in parallel computing to predict the theoretical speedup when using multiple processors.  For example, if a program needs 20 hours using a single processor core, and a particular part of the program which takes one hour to execute cannot be parallelized, while the remaining 19 hours ( ) of execution time can be parallelized, then regardless of how many processors are devoted to a parallelized execution of this program, the minimum execution time cannot be less than that critical one hour. 

April 27<====>2326<====>April 27Events33 BC – Lucius Marcius Philippus, step-brother to the future emperor Augustus, celebrates a triumph for his victories while serving as governor in one of the provinces of Hispania. 395 – Emperor Arcadius marries Aelia Eudoxia, daughter of the Frankish general Flavius Bauto.  She becomes one of the more powerful Roman empresses of Late Antiquity. 629 – Shahrbaraz is crowned as king of the Sasanian Empire. 711 – Islamic conquest of Hispania: Moorish troops led by Tariq ibn Ziyad land at Gibraltar to begin their invasion of the Iberian Peninsula (Al-Andalus). 1296 – First War of Scottish Independence: John Balliol's Scottish army is defeated by an English army commanded by John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey at the Battle of Dunbar. 

Ayahuasca<====>2328<====>Ayahuasca Ayahuasca ( ,  ), or iowaska, or yagé ( ), is an entheogenic brew made out of Banisteriopsis caapi vine and other ingredients.   The brew is used as a traditional spiritual medicine in ceremonies among the Indigenous peoples of the Amazon basin. It has been reported that some psychoactive effects can be felt from consuming the ayahuasca vine alone.  The hallucinogen DMT will be digested in the stomach and remain inactive without the inclusion of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) such as Banisteriopsis caapi.   Therefore, a combination of both a MAOI-containing plant and DMT-containing substance is necessary for full hallucinogenic effects. 

Alfonso Leng<====>2329<====>Alfonso Leng  Alfonso Leng Haygus (11 February 1884 – 11 November 1974)  was a post-romantic composer of classical music.   He was born in Santiago, Chile.  He wrote the first important symphonic work in Chilean tradition, "La Muerte de Alcino", a symphonic poem inspired by the novel of Pedro Prado.  He composed many art songs in different languages and important piano pieces, like the five "Doloras" (1914), which he later orchestrated and are normally played in concerts in Chile and Latin America.  He won the Nacional Art Prize in 1957. Leng was also an accomplished dentist in Santiago. 

Abbe number<====>2330<====>Abbe numberIn optics and lens design, the Abbe number, also known as the V-number or constringence of a transparent material, is a measure of the material's dispersion (variation of refractive index versus wavelength), with high values of V indicating low dispersion.  It is named after Ernst Abbe (1840–1905), the German physicist who defined it. The Abbe number,   V D , of a material is defined as V_D = \frac{ n_D - 1 }{ n_F - n_C }, where n D , n F  and n C  are the refractive indices of the material at the wavelengths of the Fraunhofer D-, F- and C- spectral lines (589. 

Ablative case<====>2333<====>Ablative case  The ablative case (sometimes abbreviated  ) is a grammatical case for nouns, pronouns and adjectives in the grammar of various languages; it is sometimes used to express motion away from something, among other uses.  The word "ablative" derives from the Latin ablatus, the (irregular) perfect passive participle of auferre "to carry away".  The Ablative , The Latin Library, accessed 06-01-14  There is no ablative case in modern Germanic languages such as German, nor in ancient Greek. Indo-European languagesLatin The ablative case in Latin ([casus] ablativus) appears in various grammatical constructions, including following various prepositions, in an ablative absolute clause, and adverbially. 

Adamic language<====>2335<====>Adamic language  The Adamic language is, according to Jewish tradition (as recorded in the midrashim) and some Christians, the language spoken by Adam (and possibly Eve) in the Garden of Eden.  It is variously interpreted as either the language used by God to address Adam (the divine language), or the language invented by Adam with which he named all things (including Eve), as in  . Middle ages Traditional Jewish exegesis such as Midrash (Genesis Rabbah 38) says that Adam spoke Hebrew because the names he gives Eve – Isha (Book of Genesis 2:23) and Chava (Genesis 3:20) – only make sense in Hebrew. 

Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny<====>2338<====>Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny   Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny ( ) is a political-satirical opera composed by Kurt Weill to a German libretto by Bertolt Brecht.  It was first performed on 9 March 1930 at the   in Leipzig. Composition historyThe libretto was mainly written in early 1927 and the music was finished in the spring of 1929, although both text and music were partly revised by the authors later.  An early by-product, however, was the Mahagonny-Songspiel, sometimes known as Das kleine Mahagonny, a concert work for voices and small orchestra commissioned by the Deutsche Kammermusik Festival in Baden-Baden and premiered there on 18 July 1927. 

Avery Hopwood<====>2339<====>Avery Hopwood  James Avery Hopwood (May 28, 1882 – July 1, 1928) was an American playwright of the Jazz Age.  He had four plays running simultaneously on Broadway in 1920. Early lifeHopwood was born to James and Jule Hopwood on May 28, 1882, in Cleveland, Ohio.   He graduated from Cleveland's West High School in 1900.   In 1901, he began attending the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.  However, his family experienced financial difficulties, so for his sophomore year he transferred to Adelbert College.  He returned to the University of Michigan in the fall of 1903, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1905. 

Antipope Felix II<====>2340<====>Antipope Felix II   Antipope Felix II, an archdeacon of Rome, was installed as Pope in 355 AD after the Emperor Constantius II banished the reigning Pope, Liberius, for refusing to subscribe to a sentence of condemnation against Saint Athanasius.  Charles A.  Coulombe, Vicars of Christ ( ), p.  73 BiographyIn May 357 AD the Roman laity, which had remained faithful to Liberius, demanded that Constantius, who was on a visit to Rome, should recall Liberius.  The Emperor planned to have Felix and Liberius rule jointly, but when Liberius returned Felix was forced to retire to Porto, near Rome, where, after making an unsuccessful attempt to establish himself again in Rome, he died on 22 November 365 AD. 

Alkaloid<====>2341<====>Alkaloid Alkaloids are a group of naturally occurring chemical compounds  that mostly contain basic nitrogen atoms.

Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford (1997) and even weakly acidic properties.   Some synthetic compounds of similar structure are also termed alkaloids.   In addition to carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, alkaloids may also contain oxygen, sulfur and, more rarely, other elements such as chlorine, bromine, and phosphorus. 

Adventism<====>2343<====>Adventism    Adventism is a minor branch of Protestant Christianity    which was started in the United States during the Second Great Awakening when Baptist preacher William Miller first publicly shared his belief that the Second Coming of Jesus Christ would occur at some point between 1843 and 1844. The name refers to belief in the imminent Second Coming (or "Second Advent") of Jesus Christ.  William Miller started the Adventist movement in the 1830s.  His followers became known as Millerites.  After the Great Disappointment, the Millerite movement split up and was continued by a number of groups that held different views from one another. 

Archbishop of Canterbury<====>2345<====>Archbishop of Canterbury    The Archbishop of Canterbury is the senior bishop and principal leader of the Church of England, the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion and the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Canterbury.  The current archbishop is Justin Welby, who was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral on 21 March 2013.  Welby is the 105th in a line which goes back more than 1400 years to Augustine of Canterbury, the "Apostle to the English", sent from Rome in the year 597.  Welby succeeded Rowan Williams.  From the time of Augustine until the 16th century, the Archbishops of Canterbury were in full communion with the See of Rome and usually received the pallium from the Pope. 

Albion, Michigan<====>2346<====>Albion, Michigan Albion is a city in Calhoun County in the south central region of the Lower Peninsula of the U. S.  state of Michigan.  The population was 8,616  at the 2010 census and is part of the Battle Creek Metropolitan Statistical Area.  From the time that the earliest English-speaking settlers arrived, the area has also been known as The Forks, because it is situated at the confluence of the north and south branches of the Kalamazoo River.  The Festival of the Forks has been held annually since 1967 to celebrate Albion's ethnic heritage. The presence of several major manufacturers since the 19th century has given Albion the reputation of a factory town. 

Anointing of the Sick<====>2348<====>Anointing of the SickAnointing of the sick, known also by other names, is a form of religious anointing or "unction" (an older term with the same meaning) for the benefit of a sick person.  It is practiced by many Christian churches and denominations. Anointing of the sick was a customary practice in many civilizations, including among the ancient Greeks and early Jewish communities.  The use of oil for healing purposes is referred to in the writings of Hippocrates.   Anointing of the sick should be distinguished from other religious anointings that occur in relation to other sacraments, in particular baptism, confirmation and ordination, and also in the coronation of a monarch. 

Abstract data type<====>2349<====>Abstract data type  In computer science, an abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model for data types, where a data type is defined by its behavior (semantics) from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations.  This contrasts with data structures, which are concrete representations of data, and are the point of view of an implementer, not a user. Formally, an ADT may be defined as a "class of objects whose logical behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations";  this is analogous to an algebraic structure in mathematics. 

American Football League<====>2357<====>American Football League  The American Football League (AFL) was a major professional American football league that operated for ten seasons from 1960 until 1969, when it merged with the older National Football League (NFL).  The upstart AFL operated in direct competition with the more established NFL throughout its existence.  It was more successful than earlier rivals to the NFL with the same name, the American Football League (1926), American Football League (1936), American Football League (1940), and the later All-America Football Conference (1944-1950), played 1946-1949). This fourth version of the AFL was the most successful, created by a number of owners who had been refused NFL expansion franchises or had minor shares of NFL franchises. 

A.S. Roma<====>2358<====>A. S.  Roma    Associazione Sportiva Roma ( ,  ; Rome Sport Association), commonly referred to as simply Roma  , is a professional Italian football club based in Rome.  Founded by a merger in 1927, Roma have participated in the top-tier of Italian football for all of their existence except for 1951–52. Roma have won Serie A three times, in 1941–42, 1982–83 and 2000–01, as well as winning nine Coppa Italia titles and two Supercoppa Italiana titles.  In European competitions, Roma won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1960–61 and were runners-up in the 1983–84 European Cup and the 1990–91 UEFA Cup. 

Abu Nidal Organization<====>2360<====>Abu Nidal Organization   The Abu Nidal Organization (ANO) is the most common name for the Palestinian group Fatah – The Revolutionary Council (Fatah al-Majles al-Thawry). The ANO is named after its founder Abu Nidal.  It was created by a split from Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO in 1974.  The group has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States,    the United Kingdom,  Israel and the European Union.    Formation and background The ANO was originally formed as a result of the 1974 Rejectionist Front split in the PLO, after Arafat's Fatah had pushed through amendments of the PLO's goals, which were seen as a step towards compromise with Israel. 

Antibody<====>2362<====>Antibody An antibody (Ab), also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig),    is a large, Y-shaped protein produced mainly by plasma cells that is used by the immune system to neutralize pathogens such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses.  The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen, called an antigen, via the Fab's variable region.   Each tip of the "Y" of an antibody contains a paratope (analogous to a lock) that is specific for one particular epitope (similarly analogous to a key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with precision. 

Alessandro Scarlatti<====>2363<====>Alessandro Scarlatti Pietro Alessandro Gaspare Scarlatti (2 May 1660 – 22 October 1725) was an Italian Baroque composer, known especially for his operas and chamber cantatas.  He is considered the founder of the Neapolitan school of opera.  He was the father of two other composers, Domenico Scarlatti and Pietro Filippo Scarlatti.   LifeScarlatti was born in Palermo (or in Trapani   Alfred Music, Anthology of Italian Songs (17th & 18th Century), Volume I: Vocal Collection ), then part of the Kingdom of Sicily.  He is generally said to have been a pupil of Giacomo Carissimi in Rome, and some theorize that he had some connection with northern Italy because his early works seem to show the influence of Stradella and Legrenzi. 

Aston Martin<====>2369<====>Aston Martin Aston Martin Lagonda Limited is a British manufacturer of luxury sports cars and grand tourers.  It was founded in 1913 by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford.  Steered from 1947 by David Brown, it became associated with expensive grand touring cars in the 1950s and 1960s, and with the fictional character James Bond following his use of a DB5 model in the 1964 film Goldfinger.  Their sports cars are regarded as a British cultural icon.   Aston Martin has held a Royal Warrant as purveyor of motorcars to HRH the Prince of Wales since 1982. 

Albert Pike<====>2371<====>Albert Pike   Albert Pike (December 29, 1809 – April 2, 1891) was an American attorney, soldier, writer, and Freemason.  Early lifePike was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Ben and Sarah (Andrews) Pike, and spent his childhood in Byfield and Newburyport, Massachusetts.  His colonial ancestors settled the area in 1635,  and included John Pike (1613–1688/1689), the founder of Woodbridge, New Jersey.   He attended school in Newburyport and Framingham until he was 15.  In August 1825, he passed entrance exams at Harvard University, though when the college requested payment of tuition fees for the first two years he chose not to attend. 

ALF Tales<====>2372<====>ALF Tales  ALF Tales is a 30-minute Saturday morning animated series that aired on NBC from September 10, 1988 to December 9, 1989.  The show is a spin-off of ALF: The Animated Series which featured characters from that series play various characters from fairy tales.  The fairy tale was usually altered for comedic effect in a manner akin to Fractured Fairy Tales. Each story typically spoofs a film genre, such as the "Cinderella" episode done as an Elvis movie.  Some episodes featured a "fourth wall" effect where ALF is backstage preparing for the episode, and Rob Cowan would appear drawn as a TV executive (who introduced himself as "Roger Cowan, network executive") to try to brief ALF on how to improve this episode. 

Abdul Rashid Dostum<====>2376<====>Abdul Rashid Dostum  Abdul Rashid Dostum (   ;  , Uzbek Latin: Abdul Rashid Do‘stum, Uzbek Cyrillic: Абдул Рашид Дўстум)‎ (born 1954) is an Afghan politician and general who has served as Vice President of Afghanistan since 2014.  An ethnic Uzbek, he is a former communist general and warlord known for his infamous treachery and siding with winners during different wars in Afghanistan.   He is the chairman of his own political party, Junbish-e Milli (National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan). During the Soviet-Afghan War in the 1980s, Dostum was part of the Afghan National Army and the regional commander of the country's north, commanding about 20,000 mostly Uzbek soldiers participating in battles against mujahideen rebels.

Accelerated Graphics Port<====>2380<====>Accelerated Graphics Port  The Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) is a high-speed point-to-point channel for attaching a video card to a computer system, primarily to assist in the acceleration of 3D computer graphics.  It was originally designed as a successor to PCI-type connections for video cards.  Since 2004, AGP has been progressively phased out in favor of PCI Express (PCIe); by mid-2008, PCI Express cards dominated the market and only a few AGP models were available.   Advantages over PCIAs computers increasingly became graphically oriented, successive generations of graphics adapters began to push the limits of PCI, a bus with shared bandwidth. 

Andreas Aagesen<====>2381<====>Andreas AagesenAndreas Aagesen (5 August 1826 – 26 October 1879) was a Danish jurist. BiographyAagesen was educated for the law at Christianshavn and Copenhagen, and interrupted his studies in 1848 to take part in the First Schleswig War, in which he served as the leader of a reserve battalion.  In 1855 Aagesen became a professor of jurisprudence at the University of Copenhagen.  In 1870 he was appointed a member of the commission  for drawing up a maritime and commercial code, and the navigation  law of 1882 is mainly his work.  In 1879 he was elected a member of the Landsting (one of two chambers of the Danish Parliament, the Rigsdagen); but it is as a teacher at the university that he won his reputation.

Alois Alzheimer<====>2383<====>Alois Alzheimer   Aloysius Alzheimer ( ;   ; 14 June 1864 – 19 December 1915), known as Alois Alzheimer, was a German psychiatrist and neuropathologist and a colleague of Emil Kraepelin.  Alzheimer is credited with identifying the first published case of "presenile dementia", which Kraepelin would later identify as Alzheimer's disease.  Early life and educationAloysius Alzheimer was born in Marktbreit, Bavaria on 14 June 1864.His father served in the office of notary public in the family's hometown.   The Alzheimers moved when Alois was still young in order to give their children an opportunity to attend the Royal Humanistic Gymnasium. 

Aedile<====>2384<====>Aedile Aedile (   , from aedes, "temple edifice") was an office of the Roman Republic.  Based in Rome, the aediles were responsible for maintenance of public buildings (aedēs) and regulation of public festivals.  They also had powers to enforce public order. There were two pairs of aediles: the first were the "plebeian aediles" (Latin aediles plebis) and possession of this office was limited to plebeians; the other two were "curule aediles" (Latin aediles curules), open to both plebeians and patricians, in alternating years.  An aedilis curulis was classified as a magister curulis. The office of the aedilis was generally held by young men intending to follow the cursus honorum to high political office, traditionally after their quaestorship but before their praetorship.

Antidepressant<====>2388<====>Antidepressant  Antidepressants are drugs used for the treatment of major depressive disorder and other conditions, including dysthymia, anxiety disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorder, eating disorders, chronic pain, neuropathic pain and, in some cases, dysmenorrhoea, snoring, migraine, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), addiction, dependence, and sleep disorders.  They may be prescribed alone or in combination with other medications. The most important classes of antidepressants are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs), tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs), and noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSAs).   St John's wort is also used in the treatment of depression. 

Auger effect<====>2389<====>Auger effectThe Auger effect is a physical phenomenon in which the filling of an inner-shell vacancy of an atom is accompanied by the emission of an electron from the same atom.   When a core electron is removed, leaving a vacancy, an electron from a higher energy level may fall into the vacancy, resulting in a release of energy.  Although most often this energy is released in the form of an emitted photon, the energy can also be transferred to another electron, which is ejected from the atom; this second ejected electron is called an Auger electron.    The effect was first discovered by Lise Meitner in 1922; Pierre Victor Auger independently discovered the effect shortly after and is credited with the discovery in most of the scientific community,    in accordance with Stiegler's law of eponymy. 

Akio Morita<====>2391<====>Akio Morita    was a Japanese businessman and co-founder of Sony along with Masaru Ibuka. Early lifeAkio Morita was born in Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.  Morita's family was involved in sake, miso and soy sauce production in the village of Kosugaya (currently a part of Tokoname City) on the western coast of Chita Peninsula in Aichi Prefecture since 1665.  He was the oldest of four siblings and his father Kyuzaemon trained him as a child to take over the family business.  Akio, however, found his true calling in mathematics and physics, and in 1944 he graduated from Osaka Imperial University with a degree in physics. 

Anode<====>2392<====>Anode  An anode is an electrode through which conventional current flows into a polarized electrical device.  A common mnemonic is ACID for "anode current into device".   The direction of (positive) electric current is opposite to the direction of electron flow: (negatively charged) electrons flow out the anode to the outside circuit. Charge flowThe terms anode and cathode do not relate to the voltage polarity of those electrodes but the direction of the current: whether positive charge is flowing into or out of the device.   Conventional current quantifies the flow of positive charge.   In most cases, positive charge flows into the device via the anode, and positive charge leaves the device via the cathode. 

Analog television<====>2393<====>Analog television  Analog television or analogue television is the original television technology that uses analog signals to transmit video and audio.   In an analog television broadcast, the brightness, colors and sound are represented by rapid variations of either the amplitude, frequency or phase of the signal. Analog signals vary over a continuous range of possible values which means that electronic noise and interference becomes reproduced by the receiver.  So with analog, a moderately weak signal becomes snowy and subject to interference.  In contrast, a moderately weak digital signal and a very strong digital signal transmit equal picture quality.

Adhesive<====>2396<====>Adhesive  Adhesive may be used interchangeably with glue, cement, mucilage, or paste,  and is any substance applied to one surface, or both surfaces, of two separate items that binds them together and resists their separation.   Adjectives may be used in conjunction with the word "adhesive" to describe properties based on the substance's physical or chemical form, the type of materials joined, or conditions under which it is applied.  The use of adhesives offers many advantages over binding techniques such as sewing, mechanical fastening, thermal bonding, etc.  These include the ability to bind different materials together, to distribute stress more efficiently across the joint, the cost effectiveness of an easily mechanized process, an improvement in aesthetic design, and increased design flexibility. 

Anthony Hopkins<====>2397<====>Anthony HopkinsSir Philip Anthony "Tony" Hopkins   (born 31 December 1937) is a Welsh   film, stage, and television actor.   After graduating from the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama in 1957, he trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, and was then spotted by Laurence Olivier who invited him to join the Royal National Theatre.  In 1968, he got his break in film in The Lion in Winter, playing Richard the Lionheart.  In the mid 1970s, Richard Attenborough, who would direct five Hopkins films, called him "the greatest actor of his generation.

Analytical chemistry<====>2408<====>Analytical chemistry Analytical chemistry studies and uses instruments and methods used to separate, identify, and quantify matter.In practice separation, identification or quantification may constitute the entire analysis or be combined with another method.  Separation isolates analytes.  Qualitative analysis identifies analytes, while quantitative analysis determines the numerical amount or concentration. Analytical chemistry consists of classical, wet chemical methods and modern, instrumental methods.Classical qualitative methods use separations such as precipitation, extraction, and distillation.  Identification may be based on differences in color, odor, melting point, boiling point, radioactivity or reactivity. 

A cappella<====>2411<====>A cappella   A cappella   (Italian for "in the manner of the chapel")    music is specifically group or solo singing without instrumental accompaniment, or a piece intended to be performed in this way.  It contrasts with cantata, which is usually accompanied singing.  The term "a cappella" was originally intended to differentiate between Renaissance polyphony and Baroque concertato style.  In the 19th century a renewed interest in Renaissance polyphony coupled with an ignorance of the fact that vocal parts were often doubled by instrumentalists led to the term coming to mean unaccompanied vocal music. 

Arrangement<====>2414<====>Arrangement  In music, an arrangement is a musical reconceptualization of a previously composed work.It may differ from the original work by means of reharmonization, melodic paraphrasing, orchestration, or development of the formal structure.  Arranging differs from orchestration as the latter process is limited to the assignment of notes to instruments for performance by an orchestra, concert band, or other musical ensemble.  Arranging "involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or modulations, and endings. . . .  Arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety". 

Athanasian Creed<====>2416<====>Athanasian CreedThe Athanasian Creed, also known as Pseudo-Athanasian Creed or Quicunque Vult (also Quicumque Vult), is a Christian statement of belief focused on Trinitarian doctrine and Christology.

Aurangzeb<====>2425<====>AurangzebMuhi-ud-Din Muhammad    ( ) (3 November 1618 – 3 March 1707),    commonly known by the sobriquet Aurangzeb (  "Ornament of the Throne")  or by his regnal title Alamgir (  "Conqueror of the World"),  was the sixth, and widely considered the last effective Mughal emperor.  His reign lasted for 49 years from 1658 until his death in 1707.   Aurangzeb was a notable expansionist and during his reign, the Mughal Empire reached its greatest extent, ruling over nearly all of the Indian subcontinent.During his lifetime, victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to 4 million square kilometres,    and he ruled over a population estimated to be over 158 million subjects,  with an annual yearly revenue of $450 million (more than ten times that of his contemporary Louis XIV of France),    or £38,624,680 (2,879,469,894 rupees) in 1690. 

Alexandrine<====>2427<====>Alexandrine Alexandrine is a name used for several distinct types of verse line with related metrical structures, most of which are ultimately derived from the classical French alexandrine.  The line's name derives from its use in the Medieval French Roman d'Alexandre of 1170, although it had already been used several decades earlier in Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne.   The foundation of most alexandrines consists of two hemistichs (half-lines) of six syllables each, separated by a caesura (a word break, though often realized as a stronger syntactic break):o o o o o o | o o o o o oo=any syllable; |=caesuraHowever, no tradition remains this simple. 

Analog computer<====>2428<====>Analog computer An analog computer or analogue computer is a form of computer that uses the continuously changeable aspects of physical phenomena such as electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic quantities to model the problem being solved.  In contrast, digital computers represent varying quantities symbolically, as their numerical values change.  As an analog computer does not use discrete values, but rather continuous values, processes cannot be reliably repeated with exact equivalence, as they can with Turing machines.  Unlike digital signal processing, analog computers do not suffer from the quantization noise, but are limited by analog noise. Analog computers were widely used in scientific and industrial applications where digital computers of the time lacked sufficient performance. 

Minute and second of arc<====>2431<====>Minute and second of arc   A minute of arc, arcminute (arcmin), arc minute, or minute arc is a unit of angular measurement equal to   of one degree.

Anthem<====>2439<====>Anthem  An anthem is a musical composition of  , usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries.  Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work (still frequently seen in Sacred Harp and other types of shape note singing) and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music.  EtymologyAnthem is derived from the Greek   (antíphōna) via Old English  .  Both words originally referred to antiphons, a call-and-response style of singing.   The adjectival form is "anthemic".

Apoptosis<====>2457<====>Apoptosis Apoptosis (from Ancient Greek ἀπόπτωσις "falling off") is a process of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms.   Biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes (morphology) and death.  These changes include blebbing, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, chromosomal DNA fragmentation, and global  mRNA decay.  Between 50 and 70 billion cells die each day due to apoptosis in the average human adult.   For an average child between the ages of 8 and 14, approximately 20 to 30 billion cells die a day.  In contrast to necrosis, which is a form of traumatic cell death that results from acute cellular injury, apoptosis is a highly regulated and controlled process that confers advantages during an organism's lifecycle.

Amazonite<====>2487<====>Amazonite Amazonite (sometimes called "Amazon stone") is a green variety of microcline  feldspar.    The name is taken from  that of the Amazon River, from which certain green stones were formerly obtained, but it is doubtful whether green feldspar occurs in the Amazon area.    Amazonite is a mineral of limited occurrence.  Formerly it was obtained almost exclusively from the area of Miass in the Ilmensky Mountains, 50 miles southwest of Chelyabinsk, Russia, where it occurs in granitic rocks.  More recently, high-quality crystals have been obtained from Pike's Peak, Colorado, where it is found associated with smoky quartz, orthoclase, and albite in a coarse granite or pegmatite.

Anthroposophy<====>2493<====>Anthroposophy  Anthroposophy is the philosophy founded by Rudolf Steiner that postulates the existence of an objective, intellectually comprehensible spiritual world, accessible to human experience through inner development.  More specifically, it aims to develop faculties of perceptive imagination, inspiration and intuition through the cultivation of a form of thinking independent of sensory experience, Robert McDermott, The Essential Steiner,  , pp.  3–11, 392–5   and to present the results thus derived in a manner subject to rational verification.  Anthroposophy aims to attain in its study of spiritual experience the precision and clarity attained by the natural sciences in their investigations of the physical world.

Anus<====>2500<====>AnusThe anus (from Latin   meaning "ring", "circle") is an opening at the opposite end of an animal's digestive tract from the mouth.  Its function is to control the expulsion of feces, unwanted semi-solid matter produced during digestion, which, depending on the type of animal, may include: matter which the animal cannot digest, such as bones;   Summary at    food material after all the nutrients have been extracted, for example cellulose or lignin; ingested matter which would be toxic if it remained in the digestive tract; and dead or excess gut bacteria and other endosymbionts. 

Acantharea<====>2502<====>Acantharea  The Acantharea (Acantharia) are a group of radiolarian  protozoa, distinguished mainly by their skeletons. StructureThe skeletons are composed of strontium sulfate crystals,    which do not fossilize, and take the form of either ten diametric or twenty radial spines.   The central capsule is made up of microfibrils arranged into twenty  plates, each with a hole through which one spine projects, and there is also a microfibrillar cortex linked to the spines by myonemes.   These assist in flotation, together with the vacuoles in the ectoplasm, which often contain zooxanthellae. Classification by spine arrangementThe arrangement of the spines is very precise, and is described by what is called the Müllerian law, which can be described in terms of lines of latitude and longitude – the spines lie on the intersections between five of the former, symmetric about an equator, and eight of the latter, spaced uniformly. 

African National Congress<====>2503<====>African National CongressThe African National Congress (ANC) is the Republic of South Africa's governing social democratic political party.

Amphetamine<====>2504<====>AmphetamineAmphetamine (contracted from  ) is a potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, and obesity.  Amphetamine was discovered in 1887 and exists as two enantiomers: levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine.  Amphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical,  the racemic free base,  which is equal parts of the two enantiomers, levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine, in their pure amine forms.  The term is frequently used informally to refer to any combination of the enantiomers, or to either of them alone.   Historically, it has been used to treat nasal congestion and depression. 

Asynchronous communication<====>2506<====>Asynchronous communication In telecommunications, asynchronous communication is  transmission of data, generally without the use of an external clock signal, where data can be transmitted intermittently rather than in a steady stream.   Any timing required to recover data from the communication symbols is encoded within the symbols. The most significant aspect of asynchronous communications is that data is not transmitted at regular intervals, thus making possible variable bit rate, and that the transmitter and receiver clock generators do not have to be exactly synchronized all the time.  In asynchronous transmission, data is sent one byte at a time and each byte is preceded by start bit and stop bit. 

Artillery<====>2508<====>Artillery    Artillery is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms.  Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines.  As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery developed for battlefield use.  This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total firepower. In its earliest sense, the word artillery referred to any group of soldiers primarily armed with some form of manufactured weapon or armour.

Adenylyl cyclase<====>2528<====>Adenylyl cyclase  Adenylyl cyclase ( , also commonly known as adenyl cyclase and adenylate cyclase, abbreviated AC) is an enzyme with key regulatory roles in essentially all cells.  It is the most polyphyletic known enzyme: six distinct classes have been described, all catalyzing the same reaction but representing unrelated gene families with no known sequence or structural homology.  The best known class of adenylyl cyclases is class III or AC-III (Roman numerals are used for classes).  AC-III occurs widely in eukaryotes and has important roles in many human tissues. All classes of adenylyl cyclases catalyse the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to 3',5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP) and pyrophosphate.

Arbitration in the United States<====>2597<====>Arbitration in the United StatesArbitration, in the context of United States law, is a form of alternative dispute resolution—specifically, a legal alternative to litigation whereby the parties to a dispute agree to submit their respective positions (through agreement or hearing) to a neutral third party (the arbitrator(s) or arbiter(s)) for resolution.  In practice arbitration is generally used as a substitute for judicial systems, particularly when the judicial processes are viewed as too slow, expensive or biased.  Arbitration is also used by communities which lack formal law, as a substitute for formal law. Arbitration may also serve a distinct purpose: as an alternative to strikes and lockouts as a means of resolving labor disputes. 

Adversarial system<====>2598<====>Adversarial system The adversarial system or adversary system is a legal system used in the common law countries where two advocates represent their parties' case or position before an impartial person or group of people, usually a jury or judge, who attempt to determine the truth and pass judgment accordingly.

Many aediculae were household shrines that held small altars or statues of the Lares and Penates.   The Lares were Roman deities protecting the house and the family household gods.  The Penates were originally patron gods (really genii) of the storeroom, later becoming household gods guarding the entire house. Other aediculae were small shrines within larger temples, usually set on a base, surmounted by a pediment and surrounded by columns.  In Roman architecture the aedicula has this representative function in the society.

Aegean civilizations<====>2624<====>Aegean civilizations Aegean civilization is a general term for the European Bronze Age civilizations of Greece around the Aegean Sea.  There are three distinct but communicating and interacting geographic regions covered by this term: Crete, the Cyclades and the Greek mainland.  Crete is associated with the Minoan civilization from the Early Bronze Age.  The Cyclades converge with the mainland during the Early Helladic ("Minyan") period and with Crete in the Middle Minoan period.  From ca.  1450 BC (Late Helladic, Late Minoan), the Greek Mycenaean civilization spreads to Crete.

Aegis<====>2628<====>Aegis The aegis ( ;    aigis), as stated in the Iliad, is carried by Athena and Zeus, but its nature is uncertain.  It had been interpreted as an animal skin or a shield, sometimes bearing the head of a Gorgon.  There may be a connection with a deity named Aex or Aix, a daughter of Helios and a nurse of Zeus or alternatively a mistress of Zeus (Hyginus, Astronomica 2.  13).

Aelia Capitolina remained the official name of Jerusalem  until 638 AD, when the Arabs conquered the city and kept the first part of it as 'إلياء' (Iliyā').  NameAelia came from Hadrian's nomen gentile, Aelius, while Capitolina meant that the new city was dedicated to Jupiter Capitolinus, to whom a temple was built on the site of the former Jewish temple, the Temple Mount.

Agarose<====>2635<====>AgaroseAgarose is a polysaccharide, generally extracted from certain red seaweed. It is a linear polymer made up of the repeating unit of agarobiose, which is a disaccharide made up of  D -galactose and 3,6-anhydro- L -galactopyranose.Agarose is one of the two principal components of agar, and is purified from agar by removing agar's other component, agaropectin.  Agarose is frequently used in molecular biology for the separation of large molecules, especially DNA, by electrophoresis.   Slabs of agarose gels (usually 0. 7 - 2%) for electrophoresis are readily prepared by pouring the warm, liquid solution into a mold. 

Atomic absorption spectroscopy<====>2637<====>Atomic absorption spectroscopyAtomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) is a spectroanalytical procedure for the quantitative determination of chemical elements using the absorption of optical radiation (light) by free atoms in the gaseous state. In analytical chemistry the technique is used for determining the concentration of a particular element (the analyte) in a sample to be analyzed.  AAS can be used to determine over 70 different elements in solution or directly in solid samples   used in pharmacology, biophysics and toxicology research. Atomic absorption spectroscopy was first used as an analytical technique, and the underlying principles were established in the second half of the 19th century by Robert Wilhelm Bunsen and Gustav Robert Kirchhoff, both professors at the University of Heidelberg, Germany.

Ajanta Caves<====>2642<====>Ajanta Caves   The Ajanta Caves are about 29 rock-cut Buddhist cave monuments which date from the 2nd century BCE to about 480  CE in Aurangabad district of Maharashtra state of India. The caves include paintings and rock cut sculptures described as among the finest surviving examples of ancient Indian art, particularly expressive paintings that present emotion through gesture, pose and form.    According to UNESCO, these are masterpieces of Buddhist religious art that influenced Indian art that followed.   The caves were built in two phases, the first phase starting around the 2nd century BCE, while the second phase built around 400–650 CE according to older accounts, or in a brief period of 460–480 CE according to later scholarship.

Abatement of debts and legacies<====>2654<====>Abatement of debts and legacies   Abatement of debts and legacies is a common law doctrine of wills that holds that when the equitable assets of a deceased person are not sufficient to satisfy fully all the creditors, their debts must abate proportionately, and they must accept a dividend. In the case of legacies when the funds or assets out of which they are payable are not sufficient to pay them in full, the legacies abate in proportion, unless there is a priority given specially to any particular legacy.  Annuities are also subject to the same rule as general legacies. 

Affection<====>2661<====>Affection   Affection, attraction, infatuation, or fondness is a "disposition or state of mind or body"  that is often associated with a feeling or type of love.  It has given rise to a number of branches of philosophy and psychology concerning emotion, disease, influence, and state of being.   "Affection" is popularly used to denote a feeling or type of love, amounting to more than goodwill or friendship.  Writers on ethics generally use the word to refer to distinct states of feeling, both lasting and spasmodic.  Some contrast it with passion as being free from the distinctively sensual element. 

Affiliation (family law)<====>2662<====>Affiliation (family law) In law, affiliation  (from Latin affiliare, "to adopt as a son") was perviously the term to describe legal establishment of paternity. The following description, for the most part, was written in the early 20th century, and it should be understood as a historical document.Affiliation procedures in EnglandIn England a number of statutes on the subject have been passed, the chief being the Bastardy Act of the Parliament of 1845, and the Bastardy Laws Amendment Acts of 1872 and 1873.The mother of a bastard may summon the putative father to petty sessions within 12 months of the birth (or at any later time if he is proved to have contributed to the child's support within 12 months after the birth), and the justices, after hearing evidence on both sides, may, if the mother's evidence be corroborated in some material particular, adjudge the man to be the putative father of the child, and order him to pay a sum not exceeding five shillings a week for its maintenance, together with a sum for expenses incidental to the birth, or the funeral expenses, if it has died before the date of order, and the costs of the proceedings. An order ceases to be valid after the child reaches the age of 13, but the justices (also referred to as Gold writers under these circumstances)  may in the order direct the payments to be continued until the child is 16 years of age.    An appeal to quarter sessions is open to the defendant, and a further appeal on questions of law to the King's Bench by rule nisi or certiorari. Should the child afterwards become chargeable to the parish, the sum due by the father may be received by the parish officer. When a bastard child, whose mother has not obtained an order, becomes chargeable to the parish, the guardians may proceed against the putative father for a contribution. Any woman who is single, a widow, or a married woman living apart from her husband, may make an application for a summons, and it is immaterial where the child is begotten, provided it is born in England. An application for a summons may be made before the birth of the child, but in this case, the statement of the mother must be in the form of a sworn deposition. The defendant must be over 14 years of age. No agreement on the part of the woman to take a sum down in a discharge of the liability of the father is a bar to the making of an affiliation order. In the case of twins, it is usual to make separate applications and obtain separate summonses. The Summary Jurisdiction Act (1879) makes due provision for the enforcement of an order of affiliation. In the case of soldiers an affiliation order cannot be enforced in the usual way, but by the Army Act (1881), if an order has been made against a soldier of the regular forces, and a copy of such order be sent to the secretary of state, he may order a portion of the soldier's pay to be retained. There is no such special legislation with regard to sailors in the Royal Navy. Affiliation procedures in other countriesIn the British colonies, and in the states of the United States (with the exception of California, Idaho, Missouri, Oregon, Texas and Utah), there is some procedure (usually termed filiation) akin to that described above, by means of which a mother can obtain a contribution to the support of her illegitimate child from the putative father. The amount ordered to be paid may subsequently be increased or diminished (1905; 94 N.Y. Supplt. 372). On the continent of Europe, however, the legislation of the various countries differs rather widely. France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Russia, Serbia and the canton of Geneva provide no means of inquiry into the paternity of an illegitimate child, and consequently all support of the child falls upon the mother; on the other hand, Germany, Austria, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the majority of the Swiss cantons provide for an inquiry into the paternity of illegitimate children, and the law casts a certain amount of responsibility upon the father. Affiliation, in France, is a term applied to a species of adoption by which the person adopted succeeds equally with other heirs to the acquired, but not to the inherited, property of the deceased. In India, affiliation cases are decided by section 125 of Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). According to this section - among other things - if a person having sufficient means neglects or refuses to maintain his illegitimate child, a magistrate of the first class may, upon proof of such neglect or refusal, order such person to make a monthly allowance for the maintenance of such child.

Antidiarrhoeal<====>2690<====>Antidiarrhoeal  An anti-diarrhoeal drug (or anti-diarrheal drug in American English) is any medication which provides symptomatic relief for diarrhoea. TypesElectrolyte solutions, while not true antidiarrhoeals, are used to replace lost fluids and salts in acute cases. Bulking agents like methylcellulose, guar gum or plant fibre (bran, sterculia, isabgol, etc. ) are used for diarrhoea in functional bowel disease and to control ileostomy output. Absorbents absorb toxic substances that cause infective diarrhoea, methylcellulose is an absorbent. Anti-inflammatory compounds such as bismuth subsalicylate. Anticholinergics reduce intestinal movement and are effective against both diarrhoea and accompanying cramping.  Opioids' classical use besides pain relief is as an anti-diarrhoeal drug.

Aberration of light<====>2703<====>Aberration of light The aberration of light (also referred to as astronomical aberration, stellar aberration, or velocity aberration) is an astronomical phenomenon which produces an apparent motion of celestial objects about their true positions, dependent on the velocity of the observer.  Aberration causes objects to appear to be displaced towards the direction of motion of the observer compared to when the observer is stationary.  The change in angle is typically very small — of the order of v/c where c is the speed of light and v the velocity of the observer.  In the case of "stellar" or "annual" aberration, the apparent position of a star to an observer on Earth varies periodically over the course of a year as the Earth's velocity changes as it revolves around the Sun, by a maximum angle of approximately 20 arcseconds in right ascension or declination. 

Optical aberration<====>2704<====>Optical aberration  Aberration in optics refers to a defect in a lens such that light is not focused to a point, but is spread out over some region of space,    and hence an image formed by a lens with aberration is blurred or distorted, with the nature of the distortion depending on the type of aberration. More specifically, it can be defined as a departure of the performance of an optical system from the predictions of paraxial optics.In an imaging system, it occurs when light from one point of an object does not converge into (or does not diverge from) a single point after transmission through the system.

Autocorrelation<====>2724<====>AutocorrelationAutocorrelation, also known as serial correlation, is the correlation of a signal with a delayed copy of itself as a function of delay.  Informally, it is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them.  The analysis of autocorrelation is a mathematical tool for finding repeating patterns, such as the presence of a periodic signal obscured by noise, or identifying the missing fundamental frequency  in a signal implied by its harmonic frequencies.  It is often used in signal processing for analyzing functions or series of values, such as time domain signals. Unit root processes,  trend stationary processes, autoregressive processes, and moving average processes are specific forms of processes with autocorrelation.

Au file format<====>2732<====>Au file format  The Au file format is a simple audio file format introduced by Sun Microsystems.  The format was common on NeXT systems and on early Web pages.  Originally it was headerless, being simply 8-bit µ-law-encoded data at an 8000 Hz sample rate.  Hardware from other vendors often used sample rates as high as 8192 Hz, often integer factors of video clock signals.  Newer files have a header that consists of six unsigned 32-bit words, an optional information chunk and then the data (in big endian format). Although the format now supports many audio encoding formats, it remains associated with the µ-law logarithmic encoding.

Aspartame<====>2752<====>Aspartame   Aspartame (APM) is an artificial non-saccharide sweetener used as a sugar substitute in some foods and beverages.  In the European Union, it is codified as E951.  Aspartame is a methyl ester of the aspartic acid/phenylalanine dipeptide.   A panel of experts set up by the European Food Safety Authority concluded in 2013 that aspartame is safe for human consumption at current levels of exposure.   As of 2018 evidence does not support a long-term benefit for weight loss or in diabetes. Because its breakdown products include phenylalanine, people with the genetic condition phenylketonuria (PKU) must be aware of this as an additional source. 

AutoCAD<====>2753<====>AutoCAD AutoCAD is a commercial computer-aided design (CAD) and drafting software application.  Developed and marketed by Autodesk,    AutoCAD was first released in December 1982 as a desktop app running on microcomputers with internal graphics controllers.   Before AutoCAD was introduced, most commercial CAD programs ran on mainframe computers or minicomputers, with each CAD operator (user) working at a separate graphics terminal.   Since 2010, AutoCAD was released as a mobile- and web app as well, marketed as AutoCAD 360. AutoCAD is used across a wide range of industries, by architects, project managers, engineers, graphic designers, and many other professionals. 

AutoCAD DXF<====>2754<====>AutoCAD DXF  AutoCAD DXF (Drawing Interchange Format, or Drawing Exchange Format) is a CAD data file format developed by Autodesk  for enabling data interoperability between AutoCAD and other programs. DXF was originally introduced in December 1982 as part of AutoCAD 1. 0, and was intended to provide an exact representation of the data in the AutoCAD native file format, DWG (Drawing), for which Autodesk for many years did not publish specifications.  Because of this, correct imports of DXF files have been difficult.  Autodesk now publishes the DXF specifications as a PDF  on its website. Versions of AutoCAD from Release 10 (October 1988) and up support both ASCII and binary forms of DXF. 

Asexual reproduction<====>2756<====>Asexual reproduction Asexual reproduction is a type of reproduction by which offspring arise from a single organism, and inherit the genes of that parent only; it does not involve the fusion of gametes, and almost never changes the number of chromosomes.  Asexual reproduction is the primary form of reproduction for single-celled organisms such as the Archaea and bacteria.  Many plants and fungi reproduce asexually as well. While all prokaryotes reproduce asexually (without the formation and fusion of gametes), mechanisms for lateral gene transfer such as conjugation, transformation and transduction are sometimes likened to sexual reproduction or at least with sex, in the sense of genetic recombination in meiosis.

Alkene<====>2761<====>Alkene   In organic chemistry, an alkene is an unsaturated hydrocarbon that contains at least one carbon–carbon double bond.The words alkene and olefin are often used interchangeably (see nomenclature section below).   Acyclic alkenes, with only one double bond and no other functional groups, known as mono-enes, form a homologous series of hydrocarbons with the general formula   n   2n .Alkenes have two hydrogen atoms fewer than the corresponding alkane (with the same number of carbon atoms).  The simplest alkene, ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), with the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name ethene, is the organic compound produced on the largest scale industrially. 

Allene<====>2762<====>Allene An allene is a compound in which one carbon atom has double bonds with each of its two adjacent carbon centres.  Allenes are classified as polyenes with cumulated dienes.  The parent compound of allene is propadiene.  Compounds with an allene-type structure but with more than three carbon atoms are called cumulenes.  Allenes are much more reactive than most other alkenes.  For example, their reactivity with gaseous chlorine is more like the reactivity of alkynes than that of alkenes. Structure and bondingGeometryThe central carbon atom of allene forms two sigma bonds and two pi bonds. 

Alkyne<====>2763<====>Alkyne In organic chemistry, an alkyne is an unsaturated hydrocarbon containing at least one carbon—carbon triple bond.   The simplest acyclic alkynes with only one triple bond and no other functional groups form a homologous series with the general chemical formula   n   2n−2 .  Alkynes are traditionally known as acetylenes, although the name acetylene also refers specifically to C 2 H 2 , known formally as ethyne using IUPAC nomenclature.  Like other hydrocarbons, alkynes are generally hydrophobic but tend to be more reactive. Chemical propertiesAlkynes are characteristically more unsaturated than alkenes.  Thus they add two equivalents of bromine whereas an alkene adds only one equivalent in the reaction. 

AbiWord<====>2764<====>AbiWord AbiWord ( ) is a free and open-source software word processor.  It was originally written in C++ but since version 3 it is based on GTK+ 3.  The name "AbiWord" is derived from the root of the Spanish word " ", meaning "open".  Project Mascot Abi the Ant.  Page explains "Abi" is pronounced just like "Abby".  AbiWord was originally started by SourceGear Corporation as the first part of a proposed AbiSuite but was adopted by open source developers after SourceGear changed its business focus and ceased development.  It now runs on Linux, Microsoft Windows (Last 2. 

Ames test<====>2766<====>Ames testThe Ames test is a widely employed method that uses bacteria to test whether a given chemical can cause mutations in the DNA of the test organism.  More formally, it is a biological assay to assess the mutagenic potential of chemical compounds.A positive test indicates that the chemical is mutagenic and therefore may act as a carcinogen, because cancer is often linked to mutation.  The test serves as a quick and convenient assay to estimate the carcinogenic potential of a compound because standard carcinogen assays on mice and rats are time-consuming (taking two to three years to complete) and expensive. 

ACE inhibitor<====>2767<====>ACE inhibitor  An angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) is a pharmaceutical drug used primarily for the treatment of hypertension (elevated blood pressure) and congestive heart failure. This group of drugs causes relaxation of blood vessels as well as a decrease in blood volume, which leads to lower blood pressure and decreased oxygen demand from the heart.  They inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme, an important component of the renin–angiotensin system. Frequently prescribed ACE inhibitors include benazepril, zofenopril, perindopril, trandolapril, captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril. Medical useACE inhibitors were initially approved for the treatment of hypertension and can be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications. 

Antianginal<====>2769<====>AntianginalAn antianginal is any drug used in the treatment of angina pectoris, a symptom of ischaemic heart disease. ExamplesDrugs used are nitrates, beta blockers, or calcium channel blockers. Nitrates Nitrates cause vasodilation    of the venous capacitance vessels by stimulating the endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF).  Used to relieve both exertional and vasospastic angina by allowing venous pooling, reducing the pressure in the ventricles and so reducing wall tension and oxygen requirements in, the heart.  Short-acting nitrates are used to abort angina attacks that have occurred, while longer-acting nitrates are used in the prophylactic management of the condition. 

Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System<====>2770<====>Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification SystemThe Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System is used for the classification of active ingredients of drugs according to the organ or system on which they act and their therapeutic, pharmacological and chemical properties.  It is controlled by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology (WHOCC), and was first published in 1976.    This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics.  Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). 

Parallel ATA<====>2778<====>Parallel ATA  Parallel ATA (PATA), originally  , is an interface standard for the connection of storage devices such as hard disk drives, floppy disk drives, and optical disc drives in computers.  The standard is maintained by the X3/INCITS committee.   It uses the underlying   (ATA) and   Packet Interface (ATAPI) standards. The Parallel ATA standard is the result of a long history of incremental technical development, which began with the original AT Attachment interface, developed for use in early PC AT equipment.  The ATA interface itself evolved in several stages from Western Digital's original Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) interface. 

Atari 2600<====>2779<====>Atari 2600  The Atari 2600 (or Atari Video Computer System before November 1982) is a home video game console by Atari, Inc.  Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F video game console in 1976.   This format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware, which could only play the games that were physically built into the unit. For five years, 1977 until late 1982, the system was officially sold as Atari VCS, an abbreviation for Video Computer System. 

Atari 5200<====>2780<====>Atari 5200  The Atari 5200 SuperSystem, commonly known as the Atari 5200, is a home video game console that was introduced in 1982 by Atari Inc.  as a higher-end complementary console for the popular Atari 2600.The 5200 was created to compete with the Intellivision, but wound up more directly competing with the ColecoVision shortly after its release.  The 5200's internal hardware is almost identical to that of Atari's 8-bit computers, although software is not directly compatible between the two systems.  The 5200's controllers have an analog joystick and a numeric keypad along with start, pause and reset buttons. 

Atari 7800<====>2781<====>Atari 7800 The Atari 7800 ProSystem, or simply the Atari 7800, is a home video game console officially released by Atari Corporation in 1986.   It is almost fully backward-compatible with the Atari 2600, the first console to have backward compatibility without the use of additional modules.  It was considered affordable at a price of US$140. The 7800 has significantly improved graphics hardware over the 2600, but uses the same audio chip.  It also shipped with a different model of joystick from the 2600-standard CX40. The 1986 launch is sometimes referred to as a "re-release" or "relaunch" because the Atari 7800 had originally been announced on May 21, 1984, to replace Atari Inc. 

Atari Jaguar<====>2782<====>Atari Jaguar   The Atari Jaguar is a  home video game console that was developed by Atari Corporation.  The console was the sixth and last programmable console to be developed under the Atari brand, originally released in North America in November 1993.  Controversially, Atari marketed the Jaguar as being the first 64-bit video game console,  while competing with the existing 16-bit consoles (Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System) and the 32-bit 3DO Interactive Multiplayer platform (which launched the same year). Development on the Atari Jaguar started in the early 1990s, and was designed by Flare Technology, who were tasked by Atari to create two consoles: the Atari Panther, which would compete with the Genesis and the Super NES, and a successor, the Jaguar, which would surpass the capabilities of any other console on the market at the time. 

Atari Lynx<====>2783<====>Atari Lynx  The Atari Lynx is a 16-bit handheld game console that was released by Atari Corporation in September 1989 in North America, and in Europe and Japan in 1990.  It was the world's first handheld electronic game with a color LCD.  It was also notable for its advanced graphics and ambidextrous layout.  The Lynx competed with the Game Boy (released two months earlier), as well as the Game Gear and TurboExpress, both released the following year.  It was discontinued in 1995. FeaturesThe Atari Lynx's innovative features include being the first color handheld, with a backlit display, a switchable right-handed/left-handed (upside down) configuration, and the ability to network with up to 15 other units via its "Comlynx" system (though most games would network eight or fewer players). 

Ahimsa<====>2784<====>Ahimsa Ahimsa (IAST:  , Pāli:) means 'not to injure' and 'compassion' and refers to a key virtue in Indian religions.The word is derived from the Sanskrit root hiṃs – to strike; hiṃsā is injury or harm, a-hiṃsā is the opposite of this, i. e.  cause no injury, do no harm.    Ahimsa is also referred to as nonviolence, and it applies to all living beings—including all animals—in ancient Indian religions.  Bajpai, Shiva (2011).  The History of India - From Ancient to Modern Times, Himalayan Academy Publications (Hawaii, USA),  ; see pages 8, 98 Ahimsa is one of the cardinal virtues  and an important tenet of Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. 

Annals of Mathematics<====>2785<====>Annals of Mathematics  The Annals of Mathematics is a bimonthly mathematical journal published by Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study. Although its ISO 4 abbreviation is Ann.  Math. , Mathematical Reviews and many other mathematical publications abbreviate it as Ann.  of Math.  instead.  HistoryThe journal was established as The Analyst in 1874  and with Joel E.  Hendricks as the founding editor-in-chief.  It was "intended to afford a medium for the presentation and analysis of any and all questions of interest or importance in pure and applied Mathematics, embracing especially all new and interesting discoveries in theoretical and practical astronomy, mechanical philosophy, and engineering". 

Andrei Sakharov<====>2786<====>Andrei Sakharov    Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov ( ; 21 May 1921 14 December 1989) was a Russian nuclear physicist, dissident, and activist for disarmament, peace and human rights.  He became renowned as the designer of the Soviet Union's RDS-37, a codename for Soviet development of thermonuclear weapons.  Sakharov later became an advocate of civil liberties and civil reforms in the Soviet Union, for which he faced state persecution; these efforts earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975.  The Sakharov Prize, which is awarded annually by the European Parliament for people and organizations dedicated to human rights and freedoms, is named in his honor. 

Astrobiology<====>2787<====>Astrobiology    Astrobiology is the study of the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe: extraterrestrial life and life on Earth.  Astrobiology addresses the question of whether life exists beyond Earth, and how humans can detect it if it does.The term exobiology is similar but more specific—it covers the search for life beyond Earth, and the effects of extraterrestrial environments on living things.  Astrobiology makes use of physics, chemistry, astronomy, biology, molecular biology, ecology, planetary science, geography, and geology to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize biospheres that might be different from that on Earth. 

Air show<====>2790<====>Air show  An air show, (or airshow, air fair, air tattoo) is a public event where aircraft are exhibited. They often include aerobatics demonstrations, without they are called "static air shows" with aircraft parked on the ground. The largest is Le Bourget followed by Farnborough, while Dubai air show and Singapore Air Show are both claiming the third place.  OutlineSome airshows are held as a business venture or as a trade event where aircraft, avionics and other services are promoted to potential customers.  Many air shows are held in support of local, national or military charities.  Military air firms often organise air shows at military airfields as a public relations exercise to thank the local community, promote military careers and raise the profile of the military. 

Anthropic principle<====>2792<====>Anthropic principle The anthropic principle is a philosophical consideration that observations of the Universe must be compatible with the conscious and sapient life that observes it.  Some proponents of the anthropic principle reason that it explains why this universe has the age and the fundamental physical constants necessary to accommodate conscious life.  As a result, they believe it is unremarkable that this universe has fundamental constants that happen to fall within the narrow range thought to be compatible with life.   The strong anthropic principle (SAP) as explained by John D.  Barrow and Frank Tipler states that this is all the case because the universe is in some sense compelled to eventually have conscious and sapient life emerge within it. 

Australian Army<====>2795<====>Australian Army   The Australian Army is Australia's military land force.  It is part of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) along with the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force.  While the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) commands the ADF, the Army is commanded by the Chief of Army (CA).  The CA is therefore subordinate to the CDF, but is also directly responsible to the Minister for Defence.   Although Australian soldiers have been involved in a number of minor and major conflicts throughout its history, only in World War II has Australian territory come under direct attack. 

American Registry for Internet Numbers<====>2799<====>American Registry for Internet Numbers  The American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) is the Regional Internet Registry (RIR) for Canada, the United States, and many Caribbean and North Atlantic islands.  ARIN manages the distribution of Internet number resources, including IPv4 and IPv6 address space and AS numbers.  ARIN opened its doors for business on December 22, 1997  after incorporating on April 18, 1997.   ARIN is a nonprofit corporation with headquarters in Chantilly, Virginia, United States.   ARIN is one of five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) in the world.

Akihabara<====>2802<====>Akihabara   is a common name for the area around Akihabara Station in the Chiyoda ward of Tokyo, Japan.  Administratively, the area called Akihabara mainly belongs to the  , and the far-western part of Kanda-Sakumachō.  The name Akihabara is a shortening of  , which ultimately comes from  , named after a fire-controlling deity of a firefighting shrine built after the area was destroyed by a fire in 1869.  Cybriwsky, Roman.  Historical dictionary of Tokyo.  Scarecrow Press, 2011.  Akihabara gained the nickname   shortly after World War II for being a major shopping center for household electronic goods and the post-war black market. 

Active Directory<====>2807<====>Active DirectoryActive Directory (AD) is a directory service that Microsoft developed for Windows domain networks.  It is included in most Windows Server operating systems as a set of processes and services.   Initially, Active Directory was only in charge of centralized domain management.  Starting with Windows Server 2008, however, Active Directory became an umbrella title for a broad range of directory-based identity-related services.  A server running Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is called a domain controller.  It authenticates and authorizes all users and computers in a Windows domain type network—assigning and enforcing security policies for all computers and installing or updating software. 

Aldona of Lithuania<====>2810<====>Aldona of Lithuania  Aldona (baptized Ona or Anna; her pagan name, Aldona, is known only from the writings of Maciej Stryjkowski;    –  26 May 1339) was Queen consort of Poland (1333–1339), and a princess of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.  She was the daughter of Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania. BiographyAldona married Casimir III of Poland, when he was 15 or 16 years old.  The bride was probably of about the same age.  The marriage took place on 30 April or 16 October 1325 and was a purely political maneuver to strengthen the first Polish–Lithuanian coalition against the Teutonic Knights. 

Aron Nimzowitsch<====>2812<====>Aron Nimzowitsch Aron Nimzowitsch ( ,  , Aron Isayevich Nimtsovich; born Aron Niemzowitsch;    7 November 1886 – 16 March 1935) was a Russian-born, Danish leading chess master    and influential chess writer.  He was the foremost figure amongst the hypermoderns. LifeBorn in part of the Russian Empire, the Jewish Yiddish-speaking Nimzowitsch came from a wealthy family, where he learned chess from his father Shaya Abramovich Nimtsovich (1862, Pinsk — ?), who was a timber merchant.  By 1897 the family lived in Dvinsk .  In 1904, he travelled to Berlin to study philosophy, but set aside his studies soon and began a career as a professional chess player that same year. 

Aragonese language<====>2813<====>Aragonese language  Aragonese ( ; aragonés   in Aragonese) is a Romance language spoken in several dialects by 10,000 to 30,000 people in the Pyrenees valleys of Aragon, Spain, primarily in the comarcas of Somontano de Barbastro, Jacetania, Alto Gállego, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza/Ribagorça.  It is the only modern language which survived from medieval Navarro-Aragonese in a form distinctly different from Spanish. Informally known as fabla ("talk" or "speech"), Aragonese is also commonly referred to by the names of its local dialects such as cheso (from Valle de Hecho) or patués (from the Benasque Valley). HistoryAragonese, which developed in portions of the Ebro basin, can be traced back to the High Middle Ages. 

Advanced Mobile Phone System<====>2815<====>Advanced Mobile Phone System Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) is an analog mobile phone system standard developed by Bell Labs, and officially introduced in the Americas on October 13, 1983,    Private Line  .   MilestonesPast.   Israel in 1986, Australia in 1987, Singapore in 1988, and Pakistan in 1990.It was the primary analog mobile phone system in North America (and other locales) through the 1980s and into the 2000s.  As of February 18, 2008, carriers in the United States were no longer required to support AMPS and companies such as AT&T and Verizon have discontinued this service permanently. 

Aerodynamics<====>2819<====>Aerodynamics Aerodynamics, from Greek ἀήρ aer (air) + δυναμική (dynamics), the study of the motion of air, particularly its interaction with a solid object, such as an airplane wing.  Aerodynamics is a sub-field of fluid dynamics and gas dynamics, and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields.   The term aerodynamics is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, the difference being that "gas dynamics" applies to the study of the motion of all gases, and is not limited to air.  The formal study of aerodynamics began in the modern sense in the eighteenth century, although observations of fundamental concepts such as aerodynamic drag were recorded much earlier. 

Andreas Schlüter<====>2820<====>Andreas Schlüter Andreas Schlüter (1659 or 1660; May 1714) was a German baroque sculptor and architect, active in Poland, Berlin and Saint Petersburg. BiographyAndreas Schlüter was born probably in Hamburg   His early life is obscure as at least three different persons of that name are documented.  The records of St.  Michaelis Church, Hamburg show that an Andreas Schlüter, son of sculptor Gerhart Schlüter, had been baptized there on 22 May 1664.  Documents from Danzig (Gdańsk)   reported that an Andreas Schlüter (senior) had worked 1640-1652 in Danzig's Jopengasse lane (today's ulica Piwna).  Possibly born in 1640, an Andres Schliter is recorded as apprentice on 9 May 1656 by the mason's guild. 

Ash<====>2822<====>Ash  Ash or ashes are the solid remains of fires.  Specifically, it refers to all non-aqueous, non-gaseous residues that remain after something is burned.  In analytical chemistry, in order to analyse the mineral and metal content of chemical samples,  ash is the non-gaseous, non-liquid residue after a complete combustion. Ashes as the end product of incomplete combustion will be mostly mineral, but usually still contain an amount of combustible organic or other oxidizable residues.  The best-known type of ash is wood ash, as a product of wood combustion in campfires, fireplaces, etc.  The darker the wood ashes, the higher the content of remaining charcoal will be due to incomplete combustion. 

Antiderivative<====>2823<====>Antiderivative  In calculus, an antiderivative, primitive function, primitive integral or indefinite integralAntiderivatives are also called general integrals, and sometimes integrals.  The latter term is generic, and refers not only to indefinite integrals (antiderivatives), but also to definite integrals.  When the word “integral” is used without additional specification, the reader is supposed to deduce from the context whether it refers to a definite or indefinite integral.  Some authors define the indefinite integral of a function as the set of its infinitely many possible antiderivatives.  Others define it as an arbitrarily selected element of that set.  Wikipedia adopts the latter approach. 

Alphabet song<====>2824<====>Alphabet song    An alphabet song is any of various songs used to teach children the alphabet.  Alphabet songs typically recite the names of all letters of the alphabet of a given language in order.  The A. B. C.  (Verse 1)"The A. B. C. "   or "A. B. Cs"   is one of the best-known English language alphabet songs, and perhaps the one most frequently referred to as "the alphabet song", especially in the United States.  The song was first copyrighted in 1835 by the Boston-based music publisher Charles Bradlee, and given the title "The A. 

Antigonid dynasty<====>2826<====>Antigonid dynasty The Antigonid dynasty ( ;  ) was a dynasty of Hellenistic kings descended from Alexander the Great's general Antigonus I Monophthalmus ("the One-eyed"). History  Succeeding the Antipatrid dynasty in much of Macedonia, Antigonus ruled mostly over Asia Minor and northern Syria.   His attempts to take control of the whole of Alexander's empire led to his defeat and death at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC.  Antigonus's son Demetrius I Poliorcetes survived the battle, and managed to seize control of Macedon itself a few years later, but eventually lost his throne, dying as a prisoner of Seleucus I Nicator. 

Abjuration<====>2830<====>Abjuration Abjuration is the solemn repudiation, abandonment, or renunciation by or upon oath, often the renunciation of citizenship or some other right or privilege.   The term comes from the Latin abjurare, "to forswear". Abjuration of the realmAbjuration of the realm was a type of abjuration in ancient English law.  The person taking the oath swore to leave the country directly and promptly, never to return to the kingdom unless by permission of the sovereign.  This was often taken by fugitives who had taken sanctuary: English CommonwealthNear the start of the English Civil War, on 18 August 1643 Parliament passed "An Ordinance for Explanation of a former Ordinance for Sequestration of Delinquents Estates with some Enlargements.

A Vindication of the Rights of Woman<====>2834<====>A Vindication of the Rights of WomanA Vindication of the Rights of Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects (1792), written by the 18th-century British proto-feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy.  In it, Wollstonecraft responds to those educational and political theorists of the 18th century who did not believe women should have an education.  She argues that women ought to have an education commensurate with their position in society, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be "companions" to their husbands, rather than mere wives. 

Afghan Hound<====>2835<====>Afghan Hound The Afghan Hound is a hound that is distinguished by its thick, fine, silky coat and its tail with a ring curl at the end.  The breed was selectively bred for its unique features in the cold mountains of Afghanistan.  Its local name is Tāžī Spay ( ) or Sag-e Tāzī (Dari Persian: سگ تازی).  Other names for this breed are Kuchi Hound, Tāzī, Balkh Hound, Baluchi Hound, Barakzai Hound, Shalgar Hound, Kabul Hound, Galanday Hound or sometimes incorrectly African Hound. HistoryThe Afghan Hound has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th Century. 

Azawakh<====>2836<====>Azawakh{{Infobox dog breed  }}The Azawakh is a sighthound livestock guardian breed of dog from West Africa.  It is also used as a hunting dog, though relegated to a secondary function due to the lack of game in the region.  With ancient origins, it is raised throughout the Sahelian zone of Mali, Niger,  and Burkina Faso.   This region  includes the Azawagh Valley for which the breed is named.   While commonly associated with the nomadic Tuareg people, they are also bred and owned by other ethnic groups such as the Peulh, Bella, and Hausa. 

Acrylic paint<====>2838<====>Acrylic paint   Acrylic paint is a fast-drying paint made of pigment suspended in acrylic polymer emulsion.  Acrylic paints are water-soluble, but become water-resistant when dry.  Depending on how much the paint is diluted with water, or modified with acrylic gels, media, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can resemble a watercolor or an oil painting, or have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media.Acrylic paint is typically used for crafting, or in art classes in schools because it does not require any chemicals, and rinses away with just water. 

Angular momentum<====>2839<====>Angular momentum In physics, angular momentum (rarely, moment of momentum or rotational momentum) is the rotational equivalent of linear momentum.  It is an important quantity in physics because it is a conserved quantity – the total angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external torque. In three dimensions, the angular momentum for a point particle is a pseudovector r×p, the cross product of the particle's position vector r (relative to some origin) and its momentum vector p = mv.  This definition can be applied to each point in continua like solids or fluids, or physical fields. 

Plum pudding model<====>2840<====>Plum pudding model The plum pudding model is one of several scientific models of the atom.  First proposed by J.  J.  Thomson in 1904  soon after the discovery of the electron, but before the discovery of the atomic nucleus, the model represented an attempt to consolidate the known properties of atoms at the time: 1) electrons are negatively-charged particles and 2) atoms are neutrally-charged. OverviewIn this model, atoms were known to consist of negatively charged electrons.  Though Thomson called them "corpuscles", they were more commonly called "electrons" as G.  J.  Stoney proposed in 1894. 

Atomic theory<====>2844<====>Atomic theoryIn chemistry and physics, atomic theory is a scientific theory of the nature of matter, which states that matter is composed of discrete units called atoms.  It began as a philosophical concept in ancient Greece and entered the scientific mainstream in the early 19th century when discoveries in the field of chemistry showed that matter did indeed behave as if it were made up of atoms. The word atom comes from the Ancient Greek adjective atomos, meaning "indivisible".  Berryman, Sylvia, "Ancient Atomism", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N.

It was created on 12 August 1980 by the 1980 Montevideo Treaty,   replacing the Latin American Free Trade Association (LAFTA / ALALC).  Currently, it has 13 member countries, and any of the Latin American States may apply for accession. ObjectivesThe development of the  integration process developed within the framework of the ALADI aims at promoting the harmonious and balanced socio-economic development of the region, and its long-term objective is the gradual and progressive establishment of a Latin-American Common Market. 

Aircraft spotting<====>2858<====>Aircraft spotting  Aircraft spotting or plane spotting is a hobby of tracking the movement of aircraft, which is often accomplished by photography.  Besides monitoring aircraft, aircraft spotting enthusiasts (whom are usually called plane spotters) also record information regarding airports, air traffic control communications and airline routes. History and evolutionAviation enthusiasts have been watching airplanes and other aircraft ever since they were invented.  However, plane spotting was not considered a distinct hobby until the second half of the 20th century.  The development of technology and global resources enabled a revolution in spotting.   Point and shoot cameras, DSLRs & walkie talkies significantly changed the hobby. 

Advertising<====>2861<====>AdvertisingAdvertising is an audio or visual form of marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, non-personal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea.  William J.  Stanton.  Fundamentals of Marketing.  McGraw-Hill (1984).    Sponsors of advertising are often businesses wishing to promote their products or services.  Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser  pays for and has control over the message.  It differs from personal selling in that the message is non-personal, i. e. , not directed to a particular individual. 

AI-complete<====>2862<====>AI-completeIn the field of artificial intelligence, the most difficult problems are informally known as AI-complete or AI-hard, implying that the difficulty of these computational problems is equivalent to that of solving the central artificial intelligence problem—making computers as intelligent as people, or strong AI.  Shapiro, Stuart C.  (1992).  Artificial Intelligence In Stuart C.  Shapiro (Ed. ), Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence (Second Edition, pp.  54–57).  New York: John Wiley.  (Section 4 is on "AI-Complete Tasks". )   To call a problem AI-complete reflects an attitude that it would not be solved by a simple specific algorithm. 

Archaeoastronomy<====>2864<====>Archaeoastronomy Archaeoastronomy (also spelled archeoastronomy) is the study of how people in the past "have understood the phenomena in the sky, how they used these phenomena and what role the sky played in their cultures".   Clive Ruggles argues it is misleading to consider archaeoastronomy to be the study of ancient astronomy, as modern astronomy is a scientific discipline, while archaeoastronomy considers symbolically rich cultural interpretations of phenomena in the sky by other cultures.    It is often twinned with ethnoastronomy, the anthropological study of skywatching in contemporary societies.  Archaeoastronomy is also closely associated with historical astronomy, the use of historical records of heavenly events to answer astronomical problems and the history of astronomy, which uses written records to evaluate past astronomical practice. 

Andrzej Sapkowski<====>2865<====>Andrzej Sapkowski Andrzej Sapkowski ( ; born 21 June 1948) is a Polish fantasy writer.  He is best known for his book series, The Witcher.

Ammeter<====>2866<====>AmmeterAn ammeter (from Ampere Meter) is a measuring instrument used to measure the current in a circuit.  Electric currents are measured in amperes (A), hence the name.  Instruments used to measure smaller currents, in the milliampere or microampere range, are designated as milliammeters or microammeters.  Early ammeters were laboratory instruments which relied on the Earth's magnetic field for operation.  By the late 19th century, improved instruments were designed which could be mounted in any position and allowed accurate measurements in electric power systems.  It is generally represented by letter 'A' in a circle. HistoryThe relation between electric current, magnetic fields and physical forces was first noted by Hans Christian Ørsted who, in 1820, observed a compass needle was deflected from pointing North when a current flowed in an adjacent wire. 

Amanda Hesser<====>2868<====>Amanda Hesser Amanda Hesser (born 1971) is an American food writer, editor, cookbook author and entrepreneur.

Anxiolytic<====>2869<====>Anxiolytic  An anxiolytic (also antipanic or antianxiety agent)  is the medication or other intervention that inhibits anxiety.  This effect is in contrast to anxiogenic agents, which increase anxiety.   Together these categories of psychoactive compounds or interventions may be referred to as anxiotropic compounds or agents.  Some recreational drugs such as alcohol (also known formally as ethanol) induce anxiolysis initially; however, studies show that many of these drugs are anxiogenic.  Anxiolytic medications have been used for the treatment of anxiety disorder and its related psychological and physical symptoms.  Anxiolytics have been shown to be useful in the treatment of anxiety disorder. 

Antipsychotic<====>2870<====>Antipsychotic   Antipsychotics, also known as neuroleptics or major tranquilizers,  are a class of medication primarily used to manage psychosis (including delusions, hallucinations, paranoia or disordered thought), principally in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  They are increasingly being used in the management of non-psychotic disorders.  Antipsychotics are usually effective in relieving symptoms of psychosis in the short term.  The long-term use of antipsychotics is associated with side effects such as involuntary movement disorders, gynecomastia, and metabolic syndrome.  They are also associated with increased mortality in elderly people with dementia.  First-generation antipsychotics, known as typical antipsychotics, were discovered in the 1950s.

Amoxicillin<====>2885<====>Amoxicillin   Amoxicillin, also spelled amoxycillin, is an antibiotic useful for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections.   It is the first line treatment for middle ear infections.   It may also be used for strep throat, pneumonia, skin infections, and urinary tract infections among others.   It is taken by mouth, or less commonly by injection. Common side effects include nausea and rash.   It may also increase the risk of yeast infections and, when used in combination with clavulanic acid, diarrhea.   It should not be used in those who are allergic to penicillin. 

Amorphous solid<====>2889<====>Amorphous solid  In condensed matter physics and materials science, an amorphous (from the Greek a, without, morphé, shape, form) or non-crystalline solid is a solid that lacks the long-range order that is characteristic of a crystal.  In some older books, the term has been used synonymously with glass.  Nowadays, "glassy solid" or "amorphous solid" is considered to be the overarching concept, and glass the more special case: A glass is an amorphous solid that exhibits a glass transition.   Polymers are often amorphous.  Other types of amorphous solids include gels, thin films, and nanostructured materials such as glass.

File archiver<====>2900<====>File archiver A file archiver is a computer program that combines a number of files together into one archive file, or a series of archive files, for easier transportation or storage.  File archivers may employ lossless data compression in their archive formats to reduce the size of the archive. Basic archivers just take a list of files and concatenate their contents sequentially into archives.  The archive files need to store metadata, at least the names and lengths of the original files, if proper reconstruction is possible.  More advanced archivers store additional metadata, such as the original timestamps, file attributes or access control lists. 

Artemis<====>2905<====>ArtemisArtemis ( ;   Artemis,  ) was one of the most widely venerated of the Ancient Greek deities.  Her Roman equivalent is Diana.

Albinism<====>2909<====>Albinism   Albinism in humans is a congenital disorder characterized by the complete or partial absence of pigment in the skin, hair and eyes.  Albinism is associated with a number of vision defects, such as photophobia, nystagmus, and amblyopia.  Lack of skin pigmentation makes for more susceptibility to sunburn and skin cancers.  In rare cases such as Chédiak–Higashi syndrome, albinism may be associated with deficiencies in the transportation of melanin granules.  This also affects essential granules present in immune cells leading to increased susceptibility to infection.   Albinism results from inheritance of recessive gene alleles and is known to affect all vertebrates, including humans.

Ackermann function<====>2925<====>Ackermann functionIn computability theory, the Ackermann function, named after Wilhelm Ackermann, is one of the simplest  and earliest-discovered examples of a total computable function that is not primitive recursive.  All primitive recursive functions are total and computable, but the Ackermann function illustrates that not all total computable functions are primitive recursive. After Ackermann's publication    of his function (which had three nonnegative integer arguments), many authors modified it to suit various purposes, so that today "the Ackermann function" may refer to any of numerous variants of the original function.  One common version, the two-argument Ackermann–Péter function, is defined as follows for nonnegative integers m and n:  A(m, n) =\begin{cases}n+1 & \mbox{if } m = 0 \\A(m-1, 1) & \mbox{if } m > 0 \mbox{ and } n = 0 \\A(m-1, A(m, n-1)) & \mbox{if } m > 0 \mbox{ and } n > 0.

Dual wield<====>2943<====>Dual wieldDual wielding is using two weapons, one in each hand, during combat.  It is not a common combat practice.  Although historical records of dual wielding in war are limited, there are numerous weapon-based martial arts that involve the use of a pair of weapons.  The use of a companion weapon is sometimes employed in European martial arts and fencing, such as a parrying dagger.  Miyamoto Musashi, a Japanese swordsman and ronin, was said to have conceived of the idea of a particular style of swordsmanship involving the use of two swords. In terms of firearms and handguns, this style has been popularized by television, but is generally denounced by firearm enthusiasts due to its impracticality.

Alcopop<====>2952<====>Alcopop An alcopop (or cooler, spirit cooler in South African English, or malternative in American slang) is a term describing certain flavored alcoholic beverages with relatively low alcohol content (e. g. , 3–7% alcohol by volume), including:Malt beverages to which various fruit juices or other flavorings have been addedBeverages containing wine to which ingredients such as fruit juice or other flavorings have been added (wine coolers)Beverages containing distilled alcohol and sweet liquids such as fruit juices or other flavourings The term alcopop (a portmanteau of the words alcohol and pop) is used commonly in the United Kingdom to describe these drinks and in some countries by neoprohibitionists. 

Alkali<====>2955<====>AlkaliIn chemistry, an alkali ( ; from Arabic: al-qaly “ashes of the saltwort”) is a basic, ionic salt of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal chemical element.  An alkali also can be defined as a base that dissolves in water.  A solution of a soluble base has a pH greater than 7. 0.  The adjective alkaline is commonly, and  alkalescent less often, used in English as a synonym for basic, especially for bases soluble in water.  This broad use of the term is likely to have come about because alkalis were the first bases known to obey the Arrhenius definition of a base, and they are still among the most common bases. 

Ain't I a Woman? (book)<====>2956<====>Ain't I a Woman? (book)   Ain't I a Woman?: Black women and feminism is a 1981 book by bell hooks titled after Sojourner Truth's "Ain't I a Woman?" speech.  hooks examines the effect of racism and sexism on black women, the civil rights movement, and feminist movements from suffrage to the 1970s.  She argues that the convergence of sexism and racism during slavery contributed to black women having the lowest status and worst conditions of any group in American society.  White female abolitionists and suffragists were often more comfortable with black male abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass, while southern segregationalists and stereotypes of black female promiscuity and immorality caused protests whenever black women spoke. 

AMOS (programming language)<====>2957<====>AMOS (programming language)  AMOS BASIC is a dialect of the BASIC programming language implemented on the Amiga computer.  AMOS BASIC was published by Europress Software and originally written by François Lionet with Constantin Sotiropoulos. HistoryAMOS is a descendant of STOS BASIC for the Atari ST.  AMOS BASIC was first produced in 1990. AMOS competed on the Amiga platform with Acid Software's Blitz BASIC.  Both BASICs differed from other dialects on different platforms, in that they allowed the easy creation of fairly demanding multimedia software, with full structured code and many high-level functions to load images, animations, sounds and display them in various ways.

Convex uniform honeycomb<====>2961<====>Convex uniform honeycombIn geometry, a convex uniform honeycomb is a uniform tessellation which fills three-dimensional Euclidean space with non-overlapping convex uniform polyhedral cells. Twenty-eight such honeycombs exist:the familiar cubic honeycomb and 7 truncations thereof;the alternated cubic honeycomb and 4 truncations thereof;10 prismatic forms based on the uniform plane tilings (11 if including the cubic honeycomb);5 modifications of some of the above by elongation and/or gyration. They can be considered the three-dimensional analogue to the uniform tilings of the plane. The Voronoi diagram of any lattice forms a convex uniform honeycomb in which the cells are zonohedra. History1900: Thorold Gosset enumerated the list of semiregular convex polytopes with regular cells (Platonic solids) in his publication On the Regular and Semi-Regular Figures in Space of n Dimensions, including one regular cubic honeycomb, and two semiregular forms with tetrahedra and octahedra. 

Assassination<====>2963<====>Assassination   Assassination is the killing of a prominent person, either for political reasons or for payment.  An assassination may be prompted by religious, political, or military motives; it is an act that may be done for financial gain, to avenge a grievance, from a desire to acquire fame or notoriety, or because of a military, security or insurgent group's command to carry out the homicide. Etymology The word assassin is often believed to derive from the word Hashshashin (Arabic: حشّاشين, ħashshāshīyīn, also Hashishin, Hashashiyyin, or Assassins),   and shares its etymological roots with hashish (  or  ; from Arabic:    ). 

Alcoholism<====>2965<====>Alcoholism  Alcoholism, also known as alcohol use disorder (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in mental or physical health problems.   The disorder was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence.   In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when two or more of the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. 

Abstraction<====>2972<====>Abstraction Abstraction in its main sense is a conceptual process where general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples, literal ("real" or "concrete") signifiers, first principles, or other methods.   "An abstraction" is the outcome of this process—a concept that acts as a super-categorical noun for all subordinate concepts, and connects any related concepts as a group, field, or category.  Suzanne K.  Langer (1953), Feeling and Form: a theory of art developed from Philosophy in a New Key p.  90: "Sculptural form is a powerful abstraction from actual objects and the three-dimensional space which we construe . 

Abelian group<====>2974<====>Abelian group   In abstract algebra, an abelian group, also called a commutative group, is a group in which the result of applying the group operation to two group elements does not depend on the order in which they are written.  That is, these are the groups that obey the axiom of commutativity.  Abelian groups generalize the arithmetic of addition of integers.  They are named after early 19th century mathematician Niels Henrik Abel.  The concept of an abelian group is one of the first concepts encountered in undergraduate abstract algebra, from which many other basic concepts, such as modules and vector spaces, are developed. 

Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty<====>2975<====>Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty  The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM Treaty or ABMT) was an arms control treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems used in defending areas against ballistic missile-delivered nuclear weapons.   Under the terms of the treaty, each party was limited to two ABM complexes, each of which was to be limited to 100 anti-ballistic missiles.  Signed in 1972, it was in force for the next 30 years.   In 1997, five years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, four former Soviet republics agreed with the United States to succeed the USSR's role in the treaty. 

Austria-Hungary<====>2983<====>Austria-Hungary  Austria-Hungary, often referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Dual Monarchy in English-language sources, was a constitutional union of the Austrian Empire (the Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council, or Cisleithania) and the Kingdom of Hungary (Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen or Transleithania) that existed from 1867 to 1918, when it collapsed as a result of defeat in World War I.  The union was a result of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and came into existence on 30 March 1867.   Austria-Hungary consisted of two monarchies (Austria and Hungary), and one autonomous region: the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia under the Hungarian crown, which negotiated the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement (Nagodba) in 1868. 

Abracadabra<====>2986<====>Abracadabra Abracadabra is an incantation used as a magic word in stage magic tricks, and historically was believed to have healing powers when inscribed on an amulet.  Etymology Abracadabra is of unknown origin, and its first occurrence is in the second century works of Serenus Sammonicus, according to the Oxford English Dictionary.Several folk etymologies are associated with the word:    from phrases in Hebrew that mean "I will create as I speak",  or Aramaic "I create like the word",  to folk etymologies that point to similar words in Latin and Greek such as abraxas. 

Acts of Union 1707<====>2987<====>Acts of Union 1707The Acts of Union ( ) were two Acts of Parliament: the Union with Scotland Act 1706 passed by the Parliament of England, and the Union with England Act passed in 1707 by the Parliament of Scotland.  They put into effect the terms of the Treaty of Union that had been agreed on 22 July 1706, following negotiation between commissioners representing the parliaments of the two countries.  By the two Acts, the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland which at the time were separate states with separate legislatures, but with the same monarch were, in the words of the Treaty, "United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain". 

Admiralty<====>2988<====>Admiralty   The Admiralty, originally known as the Office of the Admiralty and Marine Affairs,  was the government department   responsible for the command of the Royal Navy first in the Kingdom of England, second in the Kingdom of Great Britain, and from 1801 to 1964,  the United Kingdom and former British Empire.   Originally exercised by a single person, the Lord High Admiral (1385–1628), the Admiralty was, from the early 18th century onwards, almost invariably put "in commission" and exercised by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, who sat on the Board of Admiralty. 

Amputation<====>2992<====>Amputation  Amputation is the removal of a limb by trauma, medical illness, or surgery.  As a surgical measure, it is used to control pain or a disease process in the affected limb, such as malignancy or gangrene.  In some cases, it is carried out on individuals as a preventative surgery for such problems.  A special case is that of congenital amputation, a congenital disorder, where fetal limbs have been cut off by constrictive bands.  In some countries, amputation of the hands, feet or other body parts is or was used as a form of punishment for people who committed crimes. 

Anemometer<====>2994<====>AnemometerAn anemometer is a device used for measuring the speed of wind, and is also a common weather station instrument.  The term is derived from the Greek word anemos, which means wind, and is used to describe any wind speed measurement instrument used in meteorology.  The first known description  of an anemometer was given by Leon Battista Alberti in 1450. HistoryThe anemometer has changed little since its development in the 15th century.  Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) is said to have invented the first mechanical anemometer around 1450.  In following centuries, numerous others, including Robert Hooke(1635–1703), developed their own versions, with some being mistakenly credited as the inventor. 

Archaeopteryx<====>2995<====>Archaeopteryx  Archaeopteryx ( ), meaning "first wing" (sometimes referred to by its German name   ("original bird" or "first bird")), is a genus of bird-like dinosaurs that is transitional between non-avian feathered dinosaurs and modern birds.  The name derives from the ancient Greek   (archaīos) meaning "ancient", and   (ptéryx), meaning "feather" or "wing".  Between the late nineteenth century and the early twenty-first century, Archaeopteryx had been generally accepted by palaeontologists and popular reference books as the oldest known bird (member of the group Avialae).Older potential avialans have since been identified, including Anchiornis, Xiaotingia, and Aurornis.

Ambrose was attracted by Origen's fame as a teacher, and visited the Catechetical School of Alexandria in 212.   At first a gnostic Valentinian and Marcionist, Ambrose, through Origen's teaching, eventually rejected this theology and became Origen's constant companion,  and was ordained deacon.    He plied Origen with questions, and urged him to write his Commentaries ( ) on the books of the Bible, and, as a wealthy nobleman and courtier,  he provided his teacher with books for his studies and secretaries to lighten the labor of composition. 

Autonomous building<====>3022<====>Autonomous building  An autonomous building is a building designed to be operated independently from infrastructural support services such as the electric power grid, gas grid, municipal water systems, sewage treatment systems, storm drains, communication services, and in some cases, public roads. Advocates of autonomous building describe advantages that include reduced environmental impacts, increased security, and lower costs of ownership.  Some cited advantages satisfy tenets of green building, not independence per se (see below).  Off-grid buildings often rely very little on civil services and are therefore safer and more comfortable during civil disaster or military attacks.  (Off-grid buildings would not lose power or water if public supplies were compromised for some reason. 

Anubis<====>3027<====>Anubis    Anubis (  or  ;   , Egyptian: jnpw, Coptic:   Anoup) is the Greek name of a god associated with mummification and the afterlife in ancient Egyptian religion, usually depicted as a canine or a man with a canine head.  Archeologists identified the sacred animal of Anubis as an Egyptian canid, that at the time was called the golden jackal, but recent genetic testing has caused the Egyptian animal to be reclassified as the African golden wolf.Like many ancient Egyptian deities, Anubis assumed different roles in various contexts. 

Arthur Jensen<====>3029<====>Arthur Jensen  Arthur Robert Jensen (August 24, 1923 – October 22, 2012) was an American psychologist and author.  He was a professor of educational psychology at the University of California, Berkeley.  Jensen was known for his work in psychometrics and differential psychology, which is concerned with how and why individuals differ behaviorally from one another. He was a major proponent of the hereditarian position in the nature and nurture debate, the position that genetics play a significant role in behavioral traits, such as intelligence and personality.  He was the author of over 400 scientific papers published in refereed journals    and sat on the editorial boards of the scientific journals Intelligence and Personality and Individual Differences. 

A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum<====>3032<====>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum  A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart. Inspired by the farces of the ancient Roman playwright Plautus (251–183 BC), specifically Pseudolus, Miles Gloriosus, and Mostellaria, the musical tells the bawdy story of a slave named Pseudolus and his attempts to win his freedom by helping his young master woo the girl next door.  The plot displays many classic elements of farce, including puns, the slamming of doors, cases of mistaken identity (frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another), and satirical comments on social class.

Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act<====>3035<====>Alaska Native Claims Settlement ActThe Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) was signed into law by President Richard Nixon on December 18, 1971, constituting at the time the largest land claims settlement in United States history.   ANCSA was intended to resolve long-standing issues surrounding aboriginal land claims in Alaska, as well as to stimulate economic development throughout Alaska.  "Recognition of aboriginal land rights in Alaska was a sharp departure from American Indian policy in other parts of the US.  Observers believe this was more a result of slow economic development within Alaska than rejection of Indian policy," citing Cooley, R. 

Adoptionism<====>3036<====>Adoptionism Adoptionism, sometimes called dynamic monarchianism, is a nontrinitarian theological doctrine which holds that Jesus was adopted as the Son of God at his baptism, his resurrection, or his ascension.  According to Epiphanius's account of the Ebionites, the group believed that Jesus was chosen on account of his sinless devotion to the will of God.  Adoptionism was declared heresy at the end of the 2nd century and was rejected by the Synods of Antioch and the First Council of Nicaea, which defined the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity and identified the man Jesus with the eternally begotten Son or Word of God in the Nicene Creed. 

Apollinarism<====>3037<====>ApollinarismApollinarism or Apollinarianism was a view proposed by Apollinaris of Laodicea (died 390) that Jesus could not have had a human mind; rather,  Jesus had a human body and lower soul (the seat of the emotions) but a divine mind.  HistoryThe Trinity had been recognized at the Council of Nicea in 325, but debate about exactly what it meant continued.  A rival to the more common belief that Jesus Christ had two natures was monophysitism ("one nature"), the doctrine that Christ had only one nature.  Apollinarism and Eutychianism were two forms of monophysitism.  Apollinaris' rejection that Christ had a human mind was considered an over-reaction to Arianism and its teaching that Christ was not divine. 

Acid–base reaction<====>3038<====>Acid–base reaction  An acid–base reaction is a chemical reaction that occurs between an acid and a base.  Several theoretical frameworks provide alternative conceptions of the reaction mechanisms and their application in solving related problems; these are called the  acid–base theories, for example, Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory.  Their importance becomes apparent in analyzing acid–base reactions for gaseous or liquid species, or when acid or base character may be somewhat less apparent.  The first of these concepts was provided by the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier, around 1776.    – Table of discoveries attributes Antoine Lavoisier as the first to posit a scientific theory in relation to oxyacids.

Amyl nitrite<====>3046<====>Amyl nitrite   Amyl nitrite is a chemical compound with the formula C 5 H 11 ONO.  A variety of isomers are known, but they all feature an amyl group attached to the nitrite functional group.  The alkyl group is unreactive and the chemical and biological properties are mainly due to the nitrite group.  Like other alkyl nitrites, amyl nitrite is bioactive in mammals, being a vasodilator, which is the basis of its use as a prescription medicine.  As an inhalant, it also has a psychoactive effect, which has led to its recreational use with its smell being described as that of old socks or dirty feet. 

Autumn<====>3049<====>Autumn   Autumn, also known as fall in American and Canadian English,  is one of the four temperate seasons.  Autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere), when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools down considerably.  One of its main features is the shedding of leaves from deciduous trees. Some cultures regard the autumnal equinox as "mid-autumn", while others with a longer temperature lag treat it as the start of autumn.   Meteorologists (and most of the temperate countries in the southern hemisphere)  use a definition based on Gregorian calendar months, with autumn being September, October, and November in the northern hemisphere,  and March, April, and May in the southern hemisphere.

Armageddon<====>3058<====>Armageddon  According to the Book of Revelation in the New Testament of the Bible, Armageddon ( , from   Harmagedōn,   Late Latin:  ,  from Hebrew:   Har Megiddo) is the prophesied location of a gathering of armies for a battle during the end times, variously interpreted as either a literal or a symbolic location.  The term is also used in a generic sense to refer to any end of the world scenario. "Mount" Tel Megiddo is not actually a mountain, but a tell (a hill created by many generations of people living and rebuilding on the same spot)  on which ancient forts were built to guard the Via Maris, an ancient trade route linking Egypt with the northern empires of Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia. 

Athlon<====>3060<====>Athlon    Athlon is the brand name applied to a series of x86-compatible microprocessors designed and manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).  The original Athlon (now called Athlon Classic) was the first seventh-generation x86 processor and was the first desktop processor to reach speeds of one gigahertz (GHz).

He was born in Hebron when David was king of Judah.  Rape of TamarAlthough he was the heir-apparent to David's throne, Amnon is best remembered for the rape of his half-sister Tamar, daughter of David and Maachah.  Despite the biblical prohibition on sexual relations between half-brothers and sisters,  Amnon had an overwhelming desire for her.  He acted on advice from his cousin, Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David's brother, to lure Tamar into his quarters by pretending to be sick and desiring her to cook a special meal for him.

Androphagi<====>3074<====>Androphagi Androphagi (Ancient Greek : "Ἀνδροφάγοι" for "man-eaters") was an ancient nation of cannibals north of Scythia (according to Herodotus ), probably in the forests between the upper waters of the Dnepr and Don.These people may have assisted the Scythians when King Darius the Great led a Persian invasion into what is now Southern Russia to punish the Scythians for their raids into the Achaemenid Empire. EtymologyHistorian Marija Gimbutas has hypothesized  that "Androphagoi" is a Greek translation of *mard-xwaar "man-eater" in the old North Iranian language of the Scythians.  From *mard-xwaar one can derive "Mordva" or "Mordvin", the Russian name of the Finno-Ugrian Erzya and Moksha peoples of east-central European Russia.

Asymptote<====>3107<====>Asymptote In analytic geometry, an asymptote ( ) of a curve is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as one or both of the x or y coordinates tends to infinity.  Some sources include the requirement that the curve may not cross the line infinitely often, but this is unusual for modern authors.   In some contexts, such as algebraic geometry, an asymptote is defined as a line which is tangent to a curve at infinity.   The word asymptote is derived from the Greek ἀσύμπτωτος (asumptōtos) which means "not falling together", from ἀ priv.

It was notable for introducing new versions of Kickstart and Workbench, and for some minor improvements in the custom chips, known as the Enhanced Chip Set (or ECS). IntroductionThe A500+ was released in several markets (including many European countries), but was never sold officially in the U. S.  Although officially introduced in 1992, some Amiga 500 Plus units had already been sold (masquerading as Amiga 500 models, and with no prior announcement) during late 1991. 

Accumulator (computing)<====>3116<====>Accumulator (computing)In a computer's central processing unit (CPU), an accumulator is a register in which intermediate arithmetic and logic results are stored.  Without a register like an accumulator, it would be necessary to write the result of each calculation (addition, multiplication, shift, etc. ) to main memory, perhaps only to be read right back again for use in the next operation.  Access to main memory is slower than access to a register like the accumulator because the technology used for the large main memory is slower (but cheaper) than that used for a register.  Early electronic computer systems were often split into two groups, those with accumulators and those without.

Arithmetic<====>3118<====>Arithmetic Arithmetic (from the Greek   arithmos, "number") is a branch of mathematics that consists of the study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional operations on them—addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, geometry, and analysis.  The terms arithmetic and higher arithmetic were used until the beginning of the 20th century as synonyms for number theory and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory.  HistoryThe prehistory of arithmetic is limited to a small number of artifacts which may indicate the conception of addition and subtraction, the best-known being the Ishango bone from central Africa, dating from somewhere between 20,000 and 18,000 BC, although its interpretation is disputed. 

Andersonville, Georgia<====>3120<====>Andersonville, Georgia  {{Infobox settlement  }}Andersonville is a city in Sumter County, Georgia, United States.

Agra Canal<====>3122<====>Agra Canal   The Agra Canal is an important Indian irrigation work which starts from Okhla in Delhi.  The Agra canal originates from Okhla barrage, downstream of Nizamuddin bridge.   It opened in 1874. . In the beginning, it was available for navigation, in Delhi, erstwhile Gurgaon, Mathura and Agra Districts, and Bharatpur State.  Later, navigation was stopped in 1904 and the canal has since then, been exclusively used for irrigation purposes only.  At present the canal does not flow in district Gurgaon, but only in Faridabad, which was earlier a part of Gurgaon. The Canal receives its water from the Yamuna River at Okhla, about 10 km to the south of New Delhi. 

Amakusa<====>3123<====>Amakusa  , which means "Heaven's Grass," is a series of islands off the west coast of Kyushu, the southernmost of the four main islands of Japan. GeographyThe largest island of the Amakusa group is Shimoshima, which is 26. 5 miles long and 13. 5 miles in extreme width ( ).  It is situated at 32°20'N, 130°E, separated from the rest of  Kumamoto Prefecture by the Yatsushiro Sea. It has no high mountains, but its surface is very hilly.  Four of the peaks rise to a height of over  .   The population resorts to the terrace system of cultivation to cope with the lack of flat arable land. 

Afterglow<====>3124<====>Afterglow  An afterglow is a broad arch of whitish or pinkish sunlight in the sky that is scattered by fine particulates like dust suspended in the atmosphere.  An afterglow may appear above the highest clouds in the hour of fading twilight, or be reflected off high snowfields in mountain regions long after sunset.  The particles produce a scattering effect upon the component parts of white light. True alpenglow, which occurs long after sunset or long before sunrise, is caused by the backscattering of red sunlight by aerosols and fine dust particles low in the atmosphere.  After sunset, alpenglow is an afterglow caused by the illumination of atmospheric particles by sunlight as it gets refracted and scattered through the Earth's atmosphere. 

Ammonius Grammaticus<====>3125<====>Ammonius Grammaticus Ammonius Grammaticus was a 4th-century Egyptian priest who, after the destruction of the pagan temple at Alexandria (389), fled to Constantinople, where he became the tutor of the ecclesiastical historian Socrates.  LifeAmmonius was formerly identified as the  author of a treatise titled Peri homoíōn kai diaphórōn léxeōn (περὶ ὁμοίων καὶ διαφόρων λέξεων, On the Differences of Synonymous Expressions). But it seems more probable that the real author was Herennius Philo of Byblus, who was born during the reign of Nero and lived till the reign of Hadrian, and that the treatise in its present form is a revision prepared by a later Byzantine editor, whose name may have been Ammonius. 

Algebraic closure<====>3129<====>Algebraic closure In mathematics, particularly abstract algebra, an algebraic closure of a field K is an algebraic extension of K that is algebraically closed.   It is one of many closures in mathematics. Using Zorn's lemma McCarthy (1991) p. 21   Kaplansky (1972) pp. 74-76  or the weaker ultrafilter lemma,    it can be shown that every field has an algebraic closure, and that the algebraic closure of a field K is unique up to an isomorphism that fixes every member of K.  Because of this essential uniqueness, we often speak of the algebraic closure of K, rather than an algebraic closure of K. 

Advanced Power Management<====>3130<====>Advanced Power Management Advanced power management (APM) is an API developed by Intel and Microsoft and released in 1992  which enables an operating system running an IBM-compatible personal computer to work with the BIOS (part of the computer's firmware) to achieve power management. Revision 1. 2 was the last version of the APM specification, released in 1996.  ACPI is intended as the successor to APM.  Microsoft dropped support for APM in Windows Vista.  The Linux kernel still mostly supports APM, with the last fully functional APM support shipping in 3. 3. OverviewAPM uses a layered approach to manage devices.

His father and mother were instrument designers themselves, who made several changes to the design of the French horn. 

Aspirated consonant<====>3134<====>Aspirated consonant   In phonetics, aspiration is the strong burst of breath that accompanies either the release or, in the case of preaspiration, the closure of some obstruents.  In English, aspirated consonants are allophones in complementary distribution with their unaspirated counterparts, but in some other languages, notably most Indian and East Asian languages, the difference is contrastive, while in Arabic and Persian, all stops are aspirated.  To feel or see the difference between aspirated and unaspirated sounds, one can put a hand or a lit candle in front of one's mouth, and say spin   and then pin  . 

Arteriovenous malformation<====>3135<====>Arteriovenous malformation  Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is an abnormal connection between arteries and veins, bypassing the capillary system.  This vascular anomaly is widely known because of its occurrence in the central nervous system (usually cerebral AVM), but can appear in any location.  Although many AVMs are asymptomatic, they can cause intense pain or bleeding or lead to other serious medical problems. AVMs are usually congenital and belong to the RASopathies. The genetic transmission patterns of AVM, if any, are unknown.  AVM is not generally thought to be an inherited disorder, unless in the context of a specific hereditary syndrome.

Atlanta was founded as a transportation hub at the intersection of two railroad lines in 1837.  After being mostly burned to the ground during the American Civil War, the city rose from its ashes to become a national center of commerce and the unofficial capital of the "New South". 

Axiology<====>3143<====>Axiology  Axiology (from Greek  , axia, "value, worth"; and  ,  ) is the philosophical study of value.  It is either the collective term for ethics and aesthetics , philosophical fields that depend crucially on notions of worth, or the foundation for these fields, and thus similar to value theory and meta-ethics.  The term was first used by Paul Lapie, in 1902,   and Eduard von Hartmann, in 1908.   Axiology studies mainly two kinds of values: ethics and aesthetics.  Ethics investigates the concepts of "right" and "good" in individual and social conduct. 

A Doll's House<====>3144<====>A Doll's House    A Doll's House ( ; also translated as A Doll House) is a three-act play written by Henrik Ibsen.  It premiered at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 21 December 1879, having been published earlier that month.   The play is set in a Norwegian town circa 1879. The play is significant for the way it deals with the fate of a married woman, who at the time in Norway lacked reasonable opportunities for self-fulfillment in a male dominated world.  It aroused a great sensation at the time,  and caused a “storm of outraged controversy” that went beyond the theatre to the world newspapers and society. 

AIM-7 Sparrow<====>3146<====>AIM-7 Sparrow    The AIM-7 Sparrow is an American, medium-range semi-active radar homing air-to-air missile operated by the United States Air Force, United States Navy and United States Marine Corps, as well as other various air forces and navies.  Sparrow and its derivatives were the West's principal beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air missile from the late 1950s until the 1990s.  It remains in service, although it is being phased out in aviation applications in favor of the more advanced AIM-120 AMRAAM. The early Sparrow was intended primarily for use against larger targets and especially bombers, and had numerous operational limitations in other uses. 

AIM-120 AMRAAM<====>3147<====>AIM-120 AMRAAM  The AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile, or AMRAAM (pronounced "am-ram"), is a modern beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) capable of all-weather day-and-night operations.  Designed with 7-inch diameter instead of 8-inch diameter form-and-fit factors, and employing active transmit-receive radar guidance instead of semi-active receive-only radar guidance, it has the advantage of being a fire-and-forget weapon when compared to the previous generation Sparrow missiles.  When an AMRAAM missile is being launched, NATO pilots use the brevity code Fox Three.    OriginsAIM-7 Sparrow MRMThe AIM-7 Sparrow medium range missile (MRM) was purchased by the US Navy from original developer Hughes Aircraft in the 1950s as its first operational air-to-air missile with "beyond visual range" (BVR) capability. 

AGM-88 HARM<====>3149<====>AGM-88 HARM The AGM-88 HARM (high-speed anti-radiation missile) is a tactical, air-to-surface anti-radiation missile designed to home in on electronic transmissions coming from surface-to-air radar systems.  It was originally developed by Texas Instruments as a replacement for the AGM-45 Shrike and AGM-78 Standard ARM system.  Production was later taken over by Raytheon Corporation when it purchased the defense production business of Texas Instruments. DescriptionThe AGM-88 can detect, attack and destroy a radar antenna or transmitter with minimal aircrew input.  The proportional guidance system that homes in on enemy radar emissions has a fixed antenna and seeker head in the missile's nose. 

AGM-65 Maverick<====>3151<====>AGM-65 Maverick  The AGM-65 Maverick is an air-to-ground tactical missile (AGM) designed for close air support.  It is the most widely produced precision-guided missile in the Western world,    and is effective against a wide range of tactical targets, including armor, air defenses, ships, ground transportation and fuel storage facilities. Originally designed and built by Hughes Missile Systems, development of the AGM-65 spanned from 1966 to 1972, after which it entered service with the United States Air Force in August 1972.  Since then, it has been exported to more than 30 countries and is certified on 25 aircraft. 

AIM-54 Phoenix<====>3152<====>AIM-54 Phoenix  The AIM-54 Phoenix is a radar-guided, long-range air-to-air missile (AAM), carried in clusters of up to six missiles on the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, its only operational launch platform.  The Phoenix was the United States' only long-range air-to-air missile.  The combination of Phoenix missile and the AN/AWG-9 guidance radar was the first aerial weapons system that could simultaneously engage multiple targets.  Both  the missile and the aircraft were used by Iran and the United States Navy.  In US service both are now retired, the AIM-54 Phoenix in 2004 and the F-14 in 2006. 

Lockheed AC-130<====>3155<====>Lockheed AC-130  The Lockheed AC-130 gunship is a heavily armed, long-endurance ground-attack variant of the C-130 Hercules transport fixed-wing aircraft.  It carries a wide array of anti-ground oriented weapons that are integrated with sophisticated sensors, navigation, and fire-control systems.  Unlike other military fixed-wing aircraft, the AC-130 relies on visual targeting.  Because its large profile and low operating altitudes (around 7,000 ft) make it an easy target, it usually flies close air support missions at night.    The airframe is manufactured by Lockheed Martin, while Boeing is responsible for the conversion into a gunship and for aircraft support. 

Alternative algebra<====>3160<====>Alternative algebra In abstract algebra, an alternative algebra is an algebra in which multiplication need not be associative, only alternative.  That is, one must have x(xy) = (xx)y  (yx)x = y(xx) for all x and y in the algebra. Every associative algebra is obviously alternative, but so too are some strictly non-associative algebras such as the octonions.  The sedenions, on the other hand, are not alternative. The associatorAlternative algebras are so named because they are precisely the algebras for which the associator is alternating.  The associator is a trilinear map given by [x,y,z] = (xy)z - x(yz) By definition a multilinear map is alternating if it vanishes whenever two of its arguments are equal. 

Arbitrage<====>3162<====>Arbitrage  In economics and finance, arbitrage ( ,  ,  ) is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets: striking a combination of matching deals that capitalize upon the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the market prices.  When used by academics, an arbitrage is a (imagined, hypothetical, thought experiment) transaction that involves no negative cash flow at any probabilistic or temporal state and a positive cash flow in at least one state; in simple terms, it is the possibility of a risk-free profit after transaction costs.  For instance, an arbitrage is present when there is the opportunity to instantaneously buy low and sell high. 

ACF Fiorentina<====>3165<====>ACF Fiorentina   ACF Fiorentina S. p. A. ,   commonly referred to as simply Fiorentina  , is a professional Italian football club from Florence, Tuscany.  Founded by a merger in 1926, and refounded in 2002 following bankruptcy, Fiorentina have played at the top level of Italian football for the majority of their existence; only four clubs have played in more Serie A seasons. Fiorentina has won two Italian Championships, in 1955–56 and again in 1968–69, as well as six Coppa Italia trophies and one Supercoppa Italiana.  On the European stage, Fiorentina won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1960–61 and lost the final one year later. 

Afrobeat<====>3168<====>Afrobeat  Afrobeat is a music genre which developed in the 1970s out of a combination of West African musical styles, such as Juju Music,It began in Nigeria in the early ‘70s with Ghanaian influences.  Nigeria's most referred, mainstream, internationally toured and Grammy recognised Country music,  Fuji music, which was influenced by the western essembles borrowed from its leading native category (the Juju music) and highlife together with American funk and jazz, with a focus on chanted vocals and percussion.  The genre features chants, call-and-response vocals, and complex, interacting rhythms.  The term was coined by Nigerian multi-instrumentalist and bandleader Fela Kuti. 

Arithmetic function<====>3170<====>Arithmetic functionIn number theory, an arithmetic, arithmetical, or number-theoretic function   is for most authors    any function f(n) whose domain is the positive integers and whose range is a subset of the complex numbers.  Hardy & Wright include in their definition the requirement that an arithmetical function "expresses some arithmetical property of n".  An example of an arithmetic function is the divisor function whose value at a positive integer n is equal to the number of divisors of n. There is a larger class of number-theoretic functions that do not fit the above definition, e. 

ANSI C<====>3172<====>ANSI C  ANSI C, ISO C and Standard C refer to the successive standards for the C programming language published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).   Historically, the names referred specifically to the original and best-supported version of the standard (known as C89 or C90).   Software developers writing in C are encouraged to conform to the standards, as doing so helps portability between compilers. History and outlookThe first standard for C was published by ANSI.  Although this document was subsequently adopted by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and subsequent revisions published by ISO have been adopted by ANSI, many programmers still use "ANSI C" to refer to the standard. 

Alien and Sedition Acts<====>3173<====>Alien and Sedition ActsThe Alien and Sedition Acts were four bills passed by the Federalist-dominated 5th United States Congress and signed into law by President John Adams in 1798.They made it harder for an immigrant to become a citizen (Naturalization Act), allowed the president to imprison and deport non-citizens who were deemed dangerous (Alien Friends Act of 1798)  or who were from a hostile nation (Alien Enemy Act of 1798),  and criminalized making false statements that were critical of the federal government (Sedition Act of 1798).  The Federalists argued that the bills strengthened national security during an undeclared naval war with France (1798–1800). 

Antinomy<====>3175<====>Antinomy Antinomy (Greek ἀντί, antí, "against, in opposition to", and νόμος, nómos, "law") refers to a real or apparent mutual incompatibility of two laws.   It is a term used in logic and epistemology, particularly in the philosophy of Kant and Roberto Unger. There are many examples of antinomy.  A self-contradictory phrase such as "There is no absolute truth" can be considered an antinomy because this statement is suggesting in itself to be an absolute truth, and therefore denies itself any truth in its statement.  A paradox such as "this sentence is false" can also be considered to be an antinomy; for the sentence to be true, it must be false, and vice versa. 

Ascending chain condition<====>3189<====>Ascending chain conditionIn mathematics, the ascending chain condition (ACC) and descending chain condition (DCC) are finiteness properties satisfied by some algebraic structures, most importantly ideals in certain commutative rings.These conditions played an important role in the development of the structure theory of commutative rings in the works of David Hilbert, Emmy Noether, and Emil Artin. The conditions themselves can be stated in an abstract form, so that they make sense for any partially ordered set.  This point of view is useful in abstract algebraic dimension theory due to Gabriel and Rentschler. DefinitionA partially ordered set (poset) P is said to satisfy the ascending chain condition (ACC) if every strictly ascending sequence of elements eventually terminates. 

Adin Steinsaltz<====>3192<====>Adin Steinsaltz Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz (Hebrew: עדין שטיינזלץ) or Adin Even Yisrael (Hebrew: עדין אבן ישראל) (born 1937) is a teacher, philosopher, social critic, and spiritual mentor, who has been hailed by Time magazine as a "once-in-a-millennium scholar".   He has devoted his life to making the Talmud accessible to all Jews.   Originally published in modern Hebrew, with a running commentary to facilitate learning, his Steinsaltz edition of the Talmud    has also been translated into English, French, Russian, and Spanish.  Beginning in 1989, Steinsaltz published several tractates in Hebrew and English of the Babylonian (Bavli) Talmud in an English-Hebrew edition. 

A. E. Housman<====>3198<====>A.  E.  Housman  Alfred Edward Housman ( ; 26 March 1859 – 30 April 1936), usually known as A.  E.  Housman, was an English classical scholar and poet, best known to the general public for his cycle of poems A Shropshire Lad.  Lyrical and almost epigrammatic in form, the poems wistfully evoke the dooms and disappointments of youth in the English countryside.   Their beauty, simplicity and distinctive imagery appealed strongly to late Victorian and Edwardian taste, and to many early 20th-century English composers both before and after the First World War.  Through their song-settings, the poems became closely associated with that era, and with Shropshire itself. 

Attribution of recent climate change<====>3201<====>Attribution of recent climate change   Attribution of recent climate change is the effort to scientifically ascertain mechanisms responsible for recent climate changes on Earth, commonly known as 'global warming'.  The effort has focused on changes observed during the period of instrumental temperature record, when records are most reliable; particularly in the last 50 years, when human activity has grown fastest and observations of the troposphere have become available.  The dominant mechanisms are anthropogenic, i. e. , the result of human activity.  They are: increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gasesglobal changes to land surface, such as deforestationincreasing atmospheric concentrations of aerosols. 

Achduart<====>3203<====>Achduart   Achduart (Gaelic: Achadh Dhubhaird ) is a small hamlet in Coigach, in Wester Ross in northwestern Scotland, now within the Highland council area.    It is situated about 4 km southeast of the village of Achiltibuie, at the end of a minor road.  A footpath continues on to the hamlet of Culnacraig, then along the coast past Ben More Coigach to Strathcanaird.   Achduart has accommodation facilities for tourists, who come for its proximity to the ocean as well as its seclusion and remoteness.  There is a Scottish Youth Hostels Association hostel in Acheninver, a short distance to the north. 

Achiltibuie<====>3204<====>Achiltibuie Achiltibuie ( ;   or Field of the yellow-haired boy ) is a long linear village in Ross and Cromarty, Highland, on the Coigach coast of northwestern Scotland, overlooking Badentarbet Bay to the west.  Loch Broom and the Summer Isles  lie to the south.  Located 10 miles (16 km) northwest of Ullapool as the crow flies.   Achiltibuie is the central community of a series of townships and communities stretching from Culnacraig, through Badenscallie and Polglass (where the community hall, the primary school and the Piping School are located), Polbain, and Reiff to Achnahaird. HistoryThe first post office in the village opened on 28 July 1884. 

Adaptive expectations<====>3205<====>Adaptive expectations  In economics, adaptive expectations is a hypothesized process by which people form their expectations about what will happen in the future based on what has happened in the past.   For example, if inflation has been higher than expected in the past, people would revise expectations for the future. One simple version of adaptive expectations is stated in the following equation, where  p^e  is the next year's rate of inflation that is currently expected;  p^e_{-1} is this year's rate of inflation that was expected last year; and  p  is this year's actual rate of inflation: p^e = p^{e}_{-1} + \lambda (p - p^{e}_{-1}) where  \lambda  is between 0 and 1. 

Mexican tetra<====>3209<====>Mexican tetra  The Mexican tetra or blind cave fish (Astyanax mexicanus)  is a freshwater fish of the family Characidae of the order Characiformes.   The type species of its genus, it is native to the Nearctic ecozone, originating in the lower Rio Grande and the Neueces and Pecos Rivers in Texas, as well as the central and eastern parts of Mexico.  Growing to a maximum total length of  , the Mexican tetra is of typical characin shape, with unremarkable, drab coloration.   Its blind cave form, however, is notable for having no eyes or pigment; it has a pinkish-white color to its body (resembling an albino). 

Atom probe<====>3211<====>Atom probeThe atom probe was introduced at the 14th Field Emission Symposium in 1967 by Erwin Wilhelm Müller and J.  A.  Panitz.  It combined a field ion microscope with a mass spectrometer having a single particle detection capability and, for the first time, an instrument could “. . .  determine the nature of one single atom seen on a metal surface and selected from neighboring atoms at the discretion of the observer”.  Atom probes are unlike conventional optical or electron microscopes, in that the magnification effect comes from the magnification provided by a highly curved electric field, rather than by the manipulation of radiation paths. 

Al Capone<====>3212<====>Al Capone    Alphonse Gabriel Capone ( ;   ; January 17, 1899 – January 25, 1947), sometimes known by the nickname "Scarface", was an American mobster, crime boss, and businessman who attained notoriety during the Prohibition era as the co-founder and boss of the Chicago Outfit.  His seven-year reign as crime boss ended when he was 33. Capone was born in Brooklyn, New York City, to Italian immigrants.  He was a Five Points Gang member who became a bouncer in organized crime premises such as brothels.  In his early twenties, he moved to Chicago and became a bodyguard and trusted factotum for Johnny Torrio, head of a criminal syndicate that illegally supplied alcohol—the forerunner of the Outfit—and was politically protected through the Unione Siciliana. 

Amplifier figures of merit<====>3214<====>Amplifier figures of meritIn electronics, the figures of merit of an amplifier are numerical measures that characterize its properties and performance.  Figures of merit can be given as a list of specifications that include properties such as gain, bandwidth, noise and linearity, among others listed in this article.  Figures of merit are important for determining the suitability of a particular amplifier for an intended use. GainThe gain of an amplifier is the ratio of output to input power or amplitude, and is usually measured in decibels.  When measured in decibels it is logarithmically related to the power ratio: G(dB)=10 log(P out  /P in ). 

Army of Darkness<====>3217<====>Army of Darkness   Army of Darkness (also known as Bruce Campbell vs.  Army of Darkness   and Army of Darkness: The Medieval Dead on its UK theatrical release ) is a 1992 American horror comedy film directed and co-written by Sam Raimi,  co-produced by Robert Tapert and Bruce Campbell and co-written by Ivan Raimi.  It stars Campbell and Embeth Davidtz.  It is the third installment in the Evil Dead franchise, and continuing from Evil Dead II, Ash Williams (Campbell) is trapped in the Middle Ages and battles the undead in his quest to return to the present. 

RUR-5 ASROC<====>3218<====>RUR-5 ASROC    The RUR-5 ASROC (for "Anti-Submarine ROCket") is an all-weather, all sea-conditions anti-submarine missile system.  Developed by the United States Navy in the 1950s, it was deployed in the 1960s, updated in the 1990s, and eventually installed on over 200 USN surface ships, specifically cruisers, destroyers, and frigates.  The ASROC has been deployed on scores of warships of many other navies, including Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Republic of China, Greece, Pakistan and others.    HistoryASROC started development as the Rocket Assisted Torpedo (RAT) program by the Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake in the early 1950s to develop a surface warship ASW weapon counter to the new post-World War II submarines which ran quieter, at much higher speed and could attack from much longer range with high speed homing torpedoes. 

Ahmed al-Nami<====>3221<====>Ahmed al-Nami  Ahmed bin Abdullah al-Nami (Arabic: أحمد بن عبد الله النعمي,  ; also transliterated as Alnami; August 17, 1977 – September 11, 2001)  was one of four hijackers of United Airlines Flight 93 as part of the September 11 attacks.  Born in Saudi Arabia, Nami had served as a muezzin and was a college student.  He left his family in 2000 to complete the Hajj, but later went to Afghanistan bound for an al-Qaeda training camp where he befriended other future hijackers and would soon be chosen to participate in the attacks. He arrived in the United States in May 2001, on a tourist visa, where he would settle in Florida up until the attacks. 

Ahmed al-Haznawi<====>3222<====>Ahmed al-Haznawi Ahmed Ibrahim al-Haznawi ( ,  ) (October 11, 1980 – September 11, 2001) was one of four hijackers of United Airlines Flight 93 as part of the September 11 attacks. He left his family to fight in Chechnya in 2000 but was probably sent to training camps in Afghanistan.  It was there he was chosen to participate in the 9/11 attacks.  He arrived in the United States in June 2001 under the direction of Al-Qaeda for terrorist attacks, on a tourist visa.  Once he was in the U. S. , he settled in Florida and helped plan out how the attacks would take place. 

Athanasius of Alexandria<====>3225<====>Athanasius of AlexandriaAthanasius of Alexandria ( ;  ; c.  296–298 – 2 May 373), also called Athanasius the Great, Athanasius the Confessor or, primarily in the Coptic Orthodox Church, Athanasius the Apostolic, was the 20th bishop of Alexandria (as Athanasius I).  His episcopate lasted 45 years (c.  8 June 328 – 2 May 373), of which over 17 were spent in five exiles ordered by four different Roman emperors.  Athanasius was a Christian theologian, a Church Father, the chief defender of Trinitarianism against Arianism, and a noted Egyptian leader of the fourth century. 

Azores<====>3226<====>Azores   The Azores (    or    ;  ,  ), officially the Autonomous Region of the Azores ( ), is one of the two autonomous regions of Portugal.  It is an archipelago composed of nine volcanic islands in the North Atlantic Ocean about   west of continental Portugal, about   west of Lisbon, in continental Portugal, about   from the African coast, and about   southeast of Newfoundland, Canada. Its main industries are agriculture, dairy farming, livestock, fishing, and tourism, which is becoming the major service activity in the region. 

Outback<====>3229<====>Outback    The Outback is the vast, remote interior of Australia.  The term "the Outback" is generally used to refer to locations that are comparatively more remote than those areas named "the bush" which, colloquially, can refer to any lands outside the main urban areas. While often envisaged as being arid, the Outback regions extend from the northern to southern Australian coastlines, and encompass a number of climatic zones; including tropical and monsoonal climates in northern areas, arid areas in the ‘red centre’ and semi-arid and temperate climates in southerly regions.    Geographically, the Outback is unified by a combination of factors, most notably a low human population density, a largely intact, natural environment and, in many places, low-intensity land uses such as pastoralism (livestock grazing) in which production is reliant on the natural environment. 

Absolute Infinite<====>3231<====>Absolute Infinite The Absolute Infinite (symbol: Ω) is an extension of the idea of infinity proposed by mathematician Georg Cantor. It can be thought as a number which is bigger than any conceivable or inconceivable quantity, either finite or transfinite. Cantor linked the Absolute Infinite with God,  and believed that it had various mathematical properties, including the reflection principle: every property of the Absolute Infinite is also held by some smaller object.  Cantor's viewCantor said: Cantor also mentioned the idea in his letters to Richard Dedekind (text in square brackets not present in original):  The Burali-Forti paradox The idea that the collection of all ordinal numbers cannot logically exist seems paradoxical to many. 

Acceptance testing<====>3233<====>Acceptance testing In engineering and its various subdisciplines, acceptance testing is a test conducted to determine if the requirements of a specification or contract are met.  It may involve chemical tests, physical tests, or performance tests. In systems engineering it may involve black-box testing performed on a system (for example: a piece of software, lots of manufactured mechanical parts, or batches of chemical products) prior to its delivery.  In software testing the ISTQB defines acceptance as: formal testing with respect to user needs, requirements, and business processes conducted to determine whether a system satisfies the acceptance criteria and to enable the user, customers or other authorized entity to determine whether or not to accept the system. 

Archbishopric of Riga<====>3234<====>Archbishopric of Riga   The Archbishopric of Riga ( ,  ) was an archbishopric in Medieval Livonia, a subject to the Holy See.  It was established in 1186 as the bishopric of Livonia at Üxküll, then after moving to Riga it became the bishopric of Riga in 1202 and was elevated to an archbishopric in 1255. Archbishops of RigaThe archbishops of Riga were also the secular rulers of Riga until 1561 when during the reformation the territory converted from Catholicism to Lutheranism and all church territories were secularized.  The see was restored as a diocese of the Catholic Church in 1918 and raised into an archdiocese in 1923. 

Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia<====>3235<====>Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia Albert Frederick ( ,  ; 7 May 1553, in Königsberg – 28 August 1618, in Fischhausen, Rybaki) was Duke of Prussia from 1568 until his death.   He was a son of Albert of Prussia and Anna Marie of Brunswick-Lüneburg.  He was the second and last Prussian duke of the Ansbach branch of the Hohenzollern family. Duke of PrussiaAlbert became Duke of Prussia after paying feudal homage to the King of Poland, Zygmunt August (Ducal Prussia was a fief of Poland), on July 19, 1569 in Lublin. The homage was described by the Polish chronicler Jan Kochanowski in his work Proporzec ("Standard"). 

Ansbach<====>3236<====>Ansbach  Ansbach ( ;  ) is a city in the German state of Bavaria.  It is the capital of the administrative region of Middle Franconia.  Ansbach is   southwest of Nuremberg and   north of Munich, on the Fränkische Rezat (Rezat River), a tributary of the Main river.  In 2004, its population was 40,723. Developed in the 8th century as a Benedictine monastery, it became the seat of the Hohenzollern family in 1331.  In 1460, the Margraves of Brandenburg-Ansbach lived here.  The city has a castle known as Margrafen–Schloss, built between 1704–1738. 

National Alliance (Italy)<====>3237<====>National Alliance (Italy)  National Alliance ( , AN) was a conservative   Luciano Bardi - Piero Ignazi - Oreste Massari, I partiti italiani, Egea 2007, pp.  151, 173n. political party in Italy.  It was the successor of the post-fascist Italian Social Movement that distanced itself from its former ideology on its convention in Fiuggi ("Fiuggi turning point") and dissolved in favour of the new National Alliance.   Gianfranco Fini was the leader of the party following its foundation in 1995, however he stepped down in 2008 after being elected to the nominally non-partisan post of President of the Chamber of Deputies and was succeeded by Ignazio La Russa, who managed the merger of the party into The People of Freedom (PdL), which happened in 2009. 

Arno<====>3240<====>Arno  The Arno is a river in the Tuscany region of Italy.  It is the most important river of central Italy after the Tiber. Source and route The river originates on Mount Falterona in the Casentino area of the Apennines, and initially takes a southward curve.  The river turns to the west near Arezzo passing through Florence, Empoli and Pisa, flowing into the Tyrrhenian Sea at Marina di Pisa. With a length of  , it is the largest river in the region.  It has many tributaries: Sieve at   long, Bisenzio at  , and the Era, Elsa, Pesa, and Pescia. 

Aveiro, Portugal<====>3244<====>Aveiro, Portugal  Aveiro (  or  ) is a city and a municipality in Portugal.  In 2011, the population was 78,450, Instituto Nacional de Estatística  in an area of  : Direção-Geral do Território   it is the second most populous city in the Centro Region of Portugal (after Coimbra).  Along with the neighbouring city of Ílhavo, Aveiro is part of an urban agglomeration that includes 120,000 inhabitants, making it one of the most important populated regions by density in the Centro Region, and primary centre of the Intermunicipal Community of Aveiro and Baixo Vouga. 

Anthony the Great<====>3246<====>Anthony the Great    Saint Anthony or Antony  ( , Antṓnios;  ,  ;   – 356) was a Christian monk from Egypt, revered since his death as a saint.  He is distinguished from other saints named Anthony by various epithets:  ,  ,  and   For his importance among the Desert Fathers and to all later Christian monasticism, he is also known as the  .  His feast day is celebrated on January 17 among the Orthodox and Catholic churches and on Tobi 22 in the Egyptian calendar used by the Coptic Church. 

Amblypoda<====>3250<====>Amblypoda Amblypoda is a taxonomic hypothesis uniting a group of extinct, herbivorous mammals.  They were considered a suborder of the primitive ungulate mammals and have since been shown to represent a polyphyletic group. CharacteristicsThe Amblypoda take their name from their short and stumpy feet, which were furnished with five toes each and supported massive pillar-like limbs.  The brain cavity was extremely small and insignificant in comparison to the bodily mass, which was equal to that of the largest rhinoceroses.  These animals were descendants of the small ancestral ungulates that retained all the primitive characteristics of the latter, accompanied by a huge increase in body size. 

Amblygonite<====>3251<====>Amblygonite Amblygonite ( ) is a fluorophosphate mineral, (Li,Na)AlPO 4 (F,OH), composed of lithium, sodium, aluminium, phosphate, fluoride and hydroxide.  The mineral occurs in pegmatite deposits and is easily mistaken for albite and other feldspars.  Its density, cleavage and flame test for lithium are diagnostic.  Amblygonite forms a series with montebrasite, the low fluorine endmember.  Geologic occurrence is in granite pegmatites, high-temperature tin veins, and greisens.  Amblygonite occurs with spodumene, apatite, lepidolite, tourmaline, and other lithium-bearing minerals in pegmatite veins.   It contains about 10% lithium, and has been utilized as a source of lithium. 

Amygdalin<====>3252<====>Amygdalin  Amygdalin (from Ancient Greek:"almond") is a naturally occurring chemical compound, famous for falsely being promoted as a cancer cure.  It is found in many plants, but most notably in the seeds (kernels) of apricot, bitter almonds, apple, peach, and plum. Amygdalin is classified as a cyanogenic glycoside because each amygdalin molecule includes a nitrile group, which can be released as the toxic cyanide anion by the action of a beta-glucosidase: when eaten by people amygdalin releases the cyanide which poisons them.   Neither amygdalin nor laetrile is a vitamin. Since the early 1950s, both amygdalin and a modified form named laetrile have been promoted as alternative cancer treatments, often using the misnomer vitamin B 17 . 

Running amok<====>3253<====>Running amok  Running amok, sometimes referred to as simply amok or gone amok,    also spelled amuk, from the Malay language, and indonesian language  , is "an episode of sudden mass assault against people or objects usually by a single individual following a period of brooding that has traditionally been regarded as occurring especially in Malay culture but is now increasingly viewed as psychopathological behavior".   The syndrome of "Amok" is found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV TR).The phrase is often used in a less serious manner when describing something that is wildly out of control or causing a frenzy (e. 

Apostles' Creed<====>3255<====>Apostles' Creed The Apostles' Creed (Latin: Symbolum Apostolorum or Symbolum Apostolicum), sometimes entitled Symbol of the Apostles, is an early statement of Christian belief—a creed or "symbol".   It is widely used by a number of Christian denominations for both liturgical and catechetical purposes, most visibly by liturgical Churches of Western tradition, including the Catholic Church, Lutheranism and Anglicanism.  It is also used by Presbyterians, Methodists and Congregationalists. The Apostles' Creed is Trinitarian in structure with sections affirming belief in God the Father, Jesus Christ His Son and the Holy Spirit.  The Apostles' Creed was based on Christian theological understanding of the Canonical gospels, the letters of the New Testament and to a lesser extent the Old Testament. 

Amicable numbers<====>3259<====>Amicable numbers  Amicable numbers are two different numbers so related that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number.  (A proper divisor of a number is a positive factor of that number other than the number itself.  For example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3. ) A pair of amicable numbers constitutes an aliquot sequence of period 2.  A related concept is that of a perfect number, which is a number that equals the sum of its own proper divisors, in other words a number which forms an aliquot sequence of period 1. 

Agar<====>3262<====>Agar   Agar (pronounced  ,  ) or agar-agar is a jelly-like substance, obtained from algae.  Agar forms the supporting structure in the cell walls of certain species of algae, and which is released on boiling.  These algae are known as agarophytes, and belong to the Rhodophyta (red algae) phylum. Agar is actually the resulting mixture of two components: the linear polysaccharide agarose, and a heterogeneous mixture of smaller molecules called agaropectin.    Agar has been used as an ingredient in desserts throughout Asia, and also as a solid substrate to contain culture media for microbiological work. 

Acid rain<====>3263<====>Acid rain   Acid rain is a rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low pH).  It can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals and infrastructure.  Acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids.  Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results.  Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by lightning strikes, and sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanic eruptions. 

Acephali<====>3266<====>Acephali   In church history, the term   (from Ancient Greek: ἀκέφαλοι akephaloi, "headless", singular ἀκέφαλος akephalos from ἀ- a-, "without", and κεφαλή kephalé, "head") has been applied to several sects that supposedly had no leader.  E.  Cobham Brewer wrote, in Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, that acephalites, "properly means men without a head. "    Jean Cooper wrote, in Dictionary of Christianity, that it characterizes "various schismatical Christian bodies".    This is "based on the Christian references taken from Brewer's Dictionary of phrase and fable".   Among them were Nestorians who rejected the Council of Ephesus condemnation of Patriarch Nestorius of Constantinople,  which deposed Nestorius and declared him a heretic. 

Anthony of Saxony<====>3269<====>Anthony of Saxony  Anthony (27 December 1755 in Dresden – 6 June 1836 in Dresden), also known by his German name Anton (full name: Anton Clemens Theodor Maria Joseph Johann Evangelista Johann Nepomuk Franz Xavier Aloys Januar), Holborn, p.  24  was a King of Saxony (1827–1836) from the House of Wettin.  He became known as Anton der Gütige, Quinger p.  35  (en: "Anthony the Kind").  He was the fifth but third surviving son of Frederick Christian, Elector of Saxony, and Maria Antonia of Bavaria. Early lifeWith few chances to take part in the politics of the Electorate of Saxony or receive any land from his older brother Frederick Augustus III, Anton lived under the shadows. 

Albert III, Duke of Saxony<====>3270<====>Albert III, Duke of Saxony  Albert III ( ) (27 January 1443 12 September 1500) was a Duke of Saxony.  He was nicknamed Albert the Bold or Albert the Courageous and founded the Albertine line of the House of Wettin. BiographyAlbert was born in Grimma as the third and youngest son (but fifth child in order of birth) of Frederick II the Gentle, Elector of Saxony, and Margarete of Austria, sister of Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor.  Later, he was a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece.  After escaping from the hands of Kunz von Kaufungen, who had abducted him together with his brother Ernest, he spent some time at the court of the emperor Frederick III in Vienna. 

Arlo Guthrie<====>3273<====>Arlo Guthrie  Arlo Davy Guthrie (born July 10, 1947) is an American folk singer-songwriter.Like his father, Woody Guthrie, he is known for singing songs of protest against social injustice.  Guthrie's best-known work is his debut piece, "Alice's Restaurant Massacree”, a satirical talking blues song about 18 minutes in length that has since become a Thanksgiving anthem.  His only top-40 hit was a cover of Steve Goodman's "City of New Orleans".  His song "Massachusetts" was named the official folk song of the state in which he has lived most of his adult life. 

Book of Alma<====>3275<====>Book of Alma  The Book of Alma (  ) is one of the books that make up the Book of Mormon.  The full title is The Book of Alma: The Son of Alma.  The title refers to Alma the Younger, a prophet and "chief judge" of the Nephites. NarrativeHistorical outlineThe Book of Alma is the longest of all the books of the Book of Mormon, consisting of 63 chapters.  The book records the first 39 years of what the Nephites termed "the reign of the judges", a period in which the Nephite nation adopted a constitutional theocratic government in which the judicial and executive branches of the government were combined. 

Antioxidant<====>3277<====>Antioxidant  An antioxidant is a molecule that inhibits the oxidation of other molecules.  Oxidation is a chemical reaction that can produce free radicals, leading to chain reactions that may damage cells.  Antioxidants such as thiols or ascorbic acid (vitamin C) terminate these chain reactions.  The term "antioxidant" is mainly used for two different groups of substances:  industrial chemicals which are added to products to prevent oxidation, and natural chemicals found in foods and body tissue which are said to have beneficial health effects. To balance the oxidative state, plants and animals maintain complex systems of overlapping antioxidants, such as glutathione and enzymes (e. 

Brass<====>3292<====>Brass Brass is a metallic  alloy that is made of copper and zinc.  The proportions of zinc and copper can vary to create different types of brass alloys with varying mechanical and electrical properties.   It is a substitutional alloy: atoms of the two constituents may replace each other within the same crystal structure. In contrast, bronze is an alloy of copper and tin.   Both bronze and brass may include small proportions of a range of other elements including arsenic, lead, phosphorus, aluminium, manganese, and silicon.  The distinction is largely historical.   Modern practice in museums and archaeology increasingly avoids both terms for historical objects in favour of the all-embracing "copper alloy". 

Bonn<====>3295<====>Bonn  The Federal City of Bonn ( ) is a city on the banks of the Rhine in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, with a population of over 300,000.  About   south-southeast of Cologne, Bonn is in the southernmost part of the Rhine-Ruhr region, Germany's largest metropolitan area, with over 11 million inhabitants. Because of a political compromise following German reunification, the German state maintains a substantial presence in Bonn, and the city is considered a second, unofficial, capital of the country.Bonn is the secondary seat of the President, the Chancellor, the Bundesrat and the primary seat of six federal government ministries and twenty federal authorities. 

Ballroom dance<====>3332<====>Ballroom danceBallroom dance is a set of partner dances, which are enjoyed both socially and competitively around the world.  Because of its performance and entertainment aspects, ballroom dance is also widely enjoyed on stage, film, and television. Ballroom dance may refer, at its widest definition, to almost any type of partner dancing as recreation.  However, with the emergence of dancesport in modern times, the term has become narrower in scope, and traditionally refers to the five International Standard and five International Latin style dances (see dance categories below).  The two styles, while differing in technique, rhythm and costumes, exemplify core elements of ballroom dancing such as control and cohesiveness. 

The Birth of a Nation<====>3333<====>The Birth of a Nation    The Birth of a Nation (originally called The Clansman) is a 1915 American silent epic drama film directed and co-produced by D.  W.  Griffith and starring Lillian Gish.  The screenplay is adapted from the novel and play The Clansman, both by Thomas Dixon Jr.  Griffith co-wrote the screenplay (with Frank E.  Woods), and co-produced the film (with Harry Aitken).  It was released on February 8, 1915. Three hours long,  the film was originally presented in two parts separated by an intermission; it was the first 12-reel film in the United States. 

Baltic Sea<====>3335<====>Baltic Sea   The Baltic Sea is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean, enclosed by Scandinavia, Finland, the Baltic countries, and the North and Central European Plain. The sea stretches from 53°N to 66°N latitude and from 10°E to 30°E longitude.  A mediterranean sea of the Atlantic, with limited water exchange between the two bodies, the Baltic Sea drains through the Danish islands into the Kattegat by way of the straits of Øresund, the Great Belt, and the Little Belt.   It includes the Gulf of Bothnia, the Bay of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of Riga, and the Bay of Gdańsk. 

Brackish water<====>3336<====>Brackish water  Brackish water is water that has more salinity  than fresh water, but not as much as seawater.  It may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water, as in estuaries, or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers.  The word comes from the Middle Dutch root "brak".  Certain human activities can produce brackish water, in particular civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish water pools for freshwater prawn farming.  Brackish water is also the primary waste product of the salinity gradient power process.  Because brackish water is hostile to the growth of most terrestrial plant species, without appropriate management it is damaging to the environment (see article on shrimp farms).

It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of   and has a population of about 11 million people.  Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59 percent of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises about 40 percent of all Belgians. 

Blues<====>3352<====>BluesBlues is a music genre  and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century.  The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs, spirituals, and the folk music of white Americans of European heritage.   Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads.The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. 

Bluegrass<====>3353<====>BluegrassBluegrass refers to several species of grasses of the genus Poa (with the most famous being the Kentucky bluegrass).The term has also been applied to various things that relate to the region in which the grass grows:Bluegrass region, a region of the United States centered in KentuckyBlue Grass, a brand name used by Belknap Hardware and Manufacturing CompanyBluegrass music, a form of American roots musicThe Blue Grass Boys, the band led by Bill Monroe that defined the Bluegrass genreBluegrass & Backroads,  a television show about people and places in the Bluegrass regionPlacesBlue Grass, Iowa, United StatesBlue Grass, Minnesota, United StatesBlue Grass, Virginia, United StatesOther usesBlue Grass Army Depot in Richmond, KentuckyBluegrass Films, an independent film studio based in Los Angeles Bluegrass (Sirius)Bluegrass (train), a passenger train of the Monon Railroad

With a steadily growing population of approximately 3. 7 million,  Berlin is the second most populous city proper in the European Union behind London and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union.Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of the rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has roughly 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. 

Benjamin Lee Whorf<====>3355<====>Benjamin Lee Whorf   Benjamin Lee Whorf ( ; April 24, 1897 – July 26, 1941) was an American linguist and fire prevention engineer.   Whorf is widely known as an advocate for the idea that differences between the structures of different languages shape how their speakers perceive and conceptualize the world.  This principle has frequently been called the "Sapir–Whorf hypothesis", after him and his mentor Edward Sapir, but Whorf called it the principle of linguistic relativity, because he saw the idea as having implications similar to Einstein's principle of physical relativity.    Throughout his life Whorf was a chemical engineer by profession, but as a young man he took up an interest in linguistics. 

Bill Clinton<====>3356<====>Bill Clinton  William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton (born   August 19, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 42nd President of the United States from 1993 to 2001.  Prior to the presidency, he was the Governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981, and again from 1983 to 1992.  A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton was ideologically a New Democrat and many of his policies reflected a centrist "Third Way" political philosophy. Clinton was born and raised in Arkansas and attended Georgetown University, the University of Oxford, and Yale Law School. 

Black letter law<====>3358<====>Black letter law In common law legal systems, black letter laws are the well-established legal rules that are no longer subject to reasonable dispute.   Some examples are the "black-letter law" of contracts or the "black-letter law" of trademarks.   Black-letter law can be contrasted with legal theory or unsettled legal issues. History and etymologyIn a 1831 case in the U. S.  Supreme Court, Jackson ex dem.  Bradford v.  Huntington, the phrase "black letter" was used: "It is seldom that a case in our time savors so much of the black letter, but the course of decisions in New York renders it unavailable. 

Blue law<====>3359<====>Blue law  Blue laws, also known as Sunday laws, are laws designed to restrict or ban some or all Sunday activities for religious reasons, particularly to promote the observance of a day of worship or rest.  Blue laws may also restrict shopping or ban sale of certain items on specific days, most often on Sundays in the western world.  Blue laws are enforced in parts of the United States and Canada as well as some European countries, particularly in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, and Norway, keeping most stores closed on Sundays. In the United States, the U. S. 

Beer<====>3363<====>Beer Beer is one of the oldest    and most widely consumed  alcoholic drinks in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea.   Beer is brewed from cereal grains—most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used.  During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer.  Barth, Roger.  The Chemistry of Beer: The Science in the Suds, Wiley 2013:  .   Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. 

Bit<====>3364<====>Bit   The bit (a portmanteau of binary digit)   [1]  is a basic unit of information used in computing and digital communications.   A binary digit can have only one of two values, and may be physically represented with a two-state device.  These state values are most commonly represented as either a  . The two values of a binary digit can also be interpreted as logical values (true/false, yes/no), algebraic signs (+/−), activation states (on/off), or any other two-valued attribute.  The correspondence between these values and the physical states of the underlying storage or device is a matter of convention, and different assignments may be used even within the same device or program. 

Byte<====>3365<====>Byte  The byte ( ) is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits.  Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer   and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures. The size of the byte has historically been hardware dependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size – byte-sizes from 1  to 48 bits  are known to have been used in the past.  Early character encoding systems often used six bits, and machines using six-bit and nine-bit bytes were common into the 1960s. 

Boron nitride<====>3370<====>Boron nitride Boron nitride is a heat and chemically resistant refractory compound of boron and nitrogen with the chemical formula BN.  It exists in various crystalline forms that are isoelectronic to a similarly structured carbon lattice.  The hexagonal form corresponding to graphite is the most stable and soft among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive to cosmetic products.  The cubic (sphalerite structure) variety analogous to diamond is called c-BN; it is softer than diamond, but its thermal and chemical stability is superior.  The rare wurtzite BN modification is similar to lonsdaleite and may even be harder than the cubic form. 

Blood on the Tracks<====>3374<====>Blood on the Tracks  Blood on the Tracks is the fifteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on January 20, 1975by Columbia Records.  The album marked Dylan's return to Columbia Records after a two-album stint with Asylum Records.  Dylan commenced recording the album in New York City in September 1974.  In December, shortly before Columbia was due to release the record, Dylan abruptly re-recorded much of the material in a studio in Minneapolis.  The final album contains five tracks from New York and five from Minneapolis. Blood on the Tracks was initially received with mixed reviews, but has subsequently been acclaimed as one of Dylan's greatest albums by critics and fans. 

Love and Theft (Bob Dylan album)<====>3375<====>Love and Theft (Bob Dylan album)  "Love And Theft" (generally referred to as Love and Theft) is the thirty-first studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on September 11, 2001, by Columbia Records.  It featured backing by his touring band of the time, with keyboardist Augie Meyers added for the sessions.  It peaked at #5 on the Billboard 200, and has been certified Gold by the RIAA.   A limited edition release included two bonus tracks on a separate disc recorded in the early 1960s, and two years later, on September 16, 2003, this album was one of fifteen Dylan titles reissued and remastered for SACD hybrid playback. 

The Beverly Hillbillies<====>3376<====>The Beverly Hillbillies    The Beverly Hillbillies is an American sitcom originally broadcast on CBS from 1962 to 1971.  The show had an ensemble cast featuring Buddy Ebsen, Irene Ryan, Donna Douglas, and Max Baer Jr.  as the Clampetts, a poor backwoods family who move to posh Beverly Hills, California, after striking oil on their land.  The show was produced by Filmways and was created by writer Paul Henning.  It was followed by two other Henning-inspired "country cousin" series on CBS: Petticoat Junction, and its spin-off Green Acres, which reversed the rags-to-riches, country-to-city model of The Beverly Hillbillies. 

Beryllium<====>3378<====>Beryllium    Beryllium is a chemical element with symbol Be and atomic number 4.  It is a relatively rare element in the universe, usually occurring as a product of the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays.  Within the cores of stars beryllium is depleted as it is fused and creates larger elements.  It is a divalent element which occurs naturally only in combination with other elements in minerals.  Notable gemstones which contain beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald) and chrysoberyl.  As a free element it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal.

Bible<====>3390<====>Bible  The Bible  (from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, tà biblía, "the books")  is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures that Jews and Christians consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans. Many different authors contributed to the Bible.  What is regarded as canonical text differs depending on traditions and groups; a number of Bible canons have evolved, with overlapping and diverging contents.   The Christian Old Testament overlaps with the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint; the Hebrew Bible is known in Judaism as the Tanakh. 

British Columbia<====>3392<====>British Columbia   British Columbia (BC or B. C. ; French: Colombie-Britannique) is the westernmost province of Canada, located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains.  With an estimated population of 4. 8 million as of 2017, it is Canada's third-most populous province. The first British settlement in the area was Fort Victoria, established in 1843, which gave rise to the City of Victoria, at first the capital of the separate Colony of Vancouver Island.  Subsequently, on the mainland, the Colony of British Columbia (1858–1866) was founded by Richard Clement Moody Minutes of the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Volume 90, Issue 1887, 1887, pp. 

Gautama Buddha<====>3395<====>Gautama Buddha   Gautama Buddha (c.  563 BCE/480 BCE – c.  483 BCE/400 BCE), also known as Siddhārtha Gautama  , Shakyamuni Buddha  ,  or simply the Buddha, after the title of Buddha, was an ascetic (śramaṇa) and sage,  on whose teachings Buddhism was founded.   He is believed to have lived and taught mostly in the eastern part of ancient India sometime between the sixth and fourth centuries BCE.   Gautama taught a Middle Way between sensual indulgence and the severe asceticism found in the śramaṇa movement  common in his region. 

Bridge<====>3397<====>Bridge  A bridge is a structure built to span physical obstacles without closing the way underneath such as a body of water, valley, or road, for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle.  There are many different designs that each serve a particular purpose and apply to different situations.  Designs of bridges vary depending on the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed and anchored, the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it. EtymologyThe Oxford English Dictionary traces the origin of the word bridge to an Old English word brycg, of the same meaning. 

Beadwork<====>3398<====>Beadwork  Beadwork is the art or craft of attaching beads to one another by stringing them with a sewing needle or beading needle and thread or thin wire, or sewing them to cloth.Beads come in a variety of materials, shapes and sizes.  Beads are used to create jewelry or other articles of personal adornment; they are also used in wall hangings and sculpture and many other artworks. Beadwork techniques are broadly divided into loom and off-loom weaving, stringing, bead embroidery, bead crochet, and bead knitting. Beads, made of durable materials, survive in the archaeological record appearing with the very advent of modern man, Homo sapiens. 

Board game<====>3401<====>Board game  A board game is a tabletop game that involves counters or   moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or "board", according to a set of rules.  Some games are based on pure strategy, but many contain an element of chance; and some are purely chance, with no element of skill. Games usually have a goal that a player aims to achieve.  Early board games represented a battle between two armies, and most modern board games are still based on defeating opponents in terms of counters, winning position, or accrual of points. There are many varieties of board games. 

Bead<====>3402<====>Bead  A bead is a small, decorative object that is formed in a variety of shapes and sizes of a material such as stone, bone, shell, glass, plastic, wood or pearl and with a small hole for threading or stringing.  Beads range in size from under   to over   in diameter.  A pair of beads made from Nassarius sea snail shells, approximately 100,000 years old, are thought to be the earliest known examples of jewellery.    Beadwork is the art or craft of making things with beads.  Beads can be woven together with specialized thread, strung onto thread or soft, flexible wire, or adhered to a surface (e. 

Bead weaving<====>3403<====>Bead weavingBead weaving (or beadweaving) using seed beads can be done either on a loom or using one of a number of off-loom stitches. On-loom beadweavingWhen weaving on a loom, the beads are locked in between the warp threads by the weft threads.   The most common bead weaving technique requires two passes of the weft thread.   First, an entire row of beads is strung on the weft thread.   Then the beads are pressed in between the warp threads.   The needle is passed back through the beads above the warp threads to lock the beads into place. 

Branchiopoda<====>3406<====>Branchiopoda  Branchiopoda is a class of crustaceans.  It comprises fairy shrimp, clam shrimp, Cladocera, Notostraca and the Devonian Lepidocaris.  They are mostly small, freshwater animals that feed on plankton and detritus. DescriptionMembers of the Branchiopoda are unified by the presence of gills on many of the animals' appendages, including some of the mouthparts.  This is also responsible for the name of the group  (from the  , gills, akin to  , windpipe;  , foot).   They generally possess compound eyes and a carapace, which may be a shell of two valves enclosing the trunk (as in most Cladocera), broad and shallow (as in the Notostraca), or entirely absent (as in the Anostraca). 

Baruch Spinoza<====>3408<====>Baruch Spinoza   Baruch Spinoza ( ;   ; born Benedito de Espinosa,  ; 24 November 1632 – 21 February 1677, later Benedict de Spinoza) was a Dutch philosopher of Sephardi/Portuguese origin.   By laying the groundwork for the 18th-century Enlightenment    and modern biblical criticism,  including modern conceptions of the self and the universe,    he came to be considered one of the great rationalists of 17th-century philosophy.   Along with René Descartes, Spinoza was a leading philosophical figure of the Dutch Golden Age.  Spinoza's given name, which means "Blessed", varies among different languages. 

Being<====>3409<====>Being    Being is the general concept encompassing objective and subjective features of reality and existence.  Anything that partakes in being is also called a "being", though often this usage is limited to entities that have subjectivity (as in the expression "human being").  The notion of "being" has, inevitably, been elusive and controversial in the history of philosophy, beginning in Western philosophy with attempts among the pre-Socratics to deploy it intelligibly. As an example of efforts in recent times, Martin Heidegger (who himself drew on ancient Greek sources) adopted after German terms like Dasein to articulate the topic. 

Bird<====>3410<====>Bird  Birds (Aves) are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton.  Birds live worldwide and range in size from the   bee hummingbird to the   ostrich.  They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds.  Birds are the closest living relatives of crocodilians.  They are descendants of extinct dinosaurs with feathers, making them the only surviving dinosaurs according to cladistics.

It was released on January 12, 1999 through Jive Records.  In June 1997, while Spears negotiated with manager Lou Pearlman to join female pop group Innosense, her mother asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song.  Rudolph decided to pitch her to record labels, sending them a demo tape with an unused song from Toni Braxton. 

Burn card<====>3412<====>Burn card In card games, a burn card is a playing card dealt from the top of a deck, and discarded ("burned"), unused by the players.  Burn cards are usually not shown to the players.  Burning is most often performed in casinos to deter a form of cheating known as card marking.  In poker, for example, the top card of the deck stub is burned at the beginning of each betting round, so that players who might have been able to read markings on that card during the previous round are less able to take advantage of that information. 

Bulgaria<====>3415<====>Bulgaria  Bulgaria ( ;  ,  tr.    ), officially the Republic of Bulgaria ( ,  tr.    ,  ), is a country in southeastern Europe.  It is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east.  With a territory of  , Bulgaria is Europe's 16th-largest country. Organised prehistoric cultures began developing on current Bulgarian lands during the Neolithic period.  Its ancient history saw the presence of the Thracians, Greeks, Persians, Celts, Romans, Goths, Alans and Huns. 

Bryozoa<====>3416<====>Bryozoa    Bryozoa (also known as the Polyzoa, Ectoprocta or commonly as moss animals),    are a phylum of aquatic invertebrate animals.  Typically about   long, they are filter feeders that sieve food particles out of the water using a retractable lophophore, a "crown" of tentacles lined with cilia.  Most marine species live in tropical waters, but a few occur in oceanic trenches, and others are found in polar waters.  One class lives only in a variety of freshwater environments, and a few members of a mostly marine class prefer brackish water. 

Biennial plant<====>3417<====>Biennial plantA biennial plant is a flowering plant that takes two years to complete its biological lifecycle.    In the first year, the plant grows leaves, stems, and roots (vegetative structures), then it enters a period of dormancy over the colder months.  Usually the stem remains very short and the leaves are low to the ground, forming a rosette.  Many biennials require a cold treatment, or vernalization, before they will flower.  During the next spring or summer, the stem of the biennial plant elongates greatly, or "bolts".  This typically makes biennial vegetables such as spinach, fennel and lettuce unusable as food. 

Bay leaf<====>3419<====>Bay leafBay leaf (plural bay leaves) refers to the aromatic leaves of several plants used in cooking.  These include:Bay laurel (Laurus nobilis, Lauraceae).  Fresh or dried bay leaves are used in cooking for their distinctive flavor and fragrance.  The leaves should be removed from the cooked food before eating (see Safety section below).  The leaves are often used to flavor soups, stews, braises and pâtés in Mediterranean cuisine and beans in Brazilian cuisine.  The fresh leaves are very mild and do not develop their full flavor until several weeks after picking and drying.    California bay leaf – the leaf of the California bay tree (Umbellularia californica, Lauraceae), also known as California laurel, Oregon myrtle, and pepperwood, is similar to the Mediterranean bay laurel, but has a stronger flavor. 

Burgess Shale<====>3422<====>Burgess Shale   The Burgess Shale is a fossil-bearing deposit exposed in the Canadian Rockies of British Columbia, Canada.It is famous for the exceptional preservation of the soft parts of its fossils.  At   (Middle Cambrian) old,    it is one of the earliest fossil beds containing soft-part imprints. The rock unit is a black shale and crops out at a number of localities near the town of Field in Yoho National Park and the Kicking Horse Pass.  Another outcrop is in Kootenay National Park 42 km to the south. 

Beavis and Butt-Head<====>3427<====>Beavis and Butt-Head  Beavis and Butt-Head is an American animated sitcom created and designed by Mike Judge.   The series originated from Frog Baseball, a 1992 short film by Judge originally aired on Liquid Television.  After seeing the short, MTV signed Judge to develop the concept.    The series first ran from March 8, 1993, to November 28, 1997.  Then the series was renewed for an eighth season which aired from October 27 to December 29, 2011.  In 1996, the series was adapted into the animated feature film Beavis and Butt-Head Do America. 

Bromeliales<====>3428<====>BromelialesThe Bromeliales is the botanical name of an order of flowering plants.   Such an order has been recognized by a few systems of plant taxonomy, with a various placement.   It appears that it always has had the same circumscription: consisting only of the family Bromeliaceae, the bromeliad or pineapple family.   The order is not recognized in the APG II system, of 2003, which places the plants involved in the order Poales.  Some examples are:The Cronquist system of 1981 placed this order in subclass Zingiberidae, of class Liliopsida [=monocotyledons]. The Thorne system (1992) placed the order in superorder Commelinanae in subclass Liliidae [=monocotyledons]. 

Brassicales<====>3429<====>Brassicales The Brassicales (or Cruciales) are an order of flowering plants, belonging to the eurosids II group of dicotyledons under the APG II system.  One character common to many members of the order is the production of glucosinolate (mustard oil) compounds. Most systems of classification have included this order, although sometimes under the name Capparales (the name chosen depending on which is thought to have priority).   The order typically contains the following families:   Akaniaceae - two species of turnipwood trees, native to Asia and eastern AustraliaBataceae – salt-tolerant shrubs from America and AustralasiaBrassicaceae – mustard and cabbage family; may include the CleomaceaeCapparaceae – caper family, sometimes included in BrassicaceaeCaricaceae – papaya familyCleomaceae Gyrostemonaceae - several genera of small shrubs and trees endemic to temperate parts of AustraliaKoeberliniaceae - one species of thorn bush native to Mexico and the US SouthwestLimnanthaceae – meadowfoam familyMoringaceae – thirteen species of trees from Africa and IndiaPentadiplandraceae - African species whose berries have two highly sweet tasting proteinsResedaceae – mignonette familySalvadoraceae - three genera found from Africa to JavaSetchellanthaceaeTovariaceaeTropaeolaceae – nasturtium familyUnder the Cronquist system, the Brassicales were called the Capparales, and included among the "Dilleniidae".  The only families included were the Brassicaceae and Capparaceae (treated as separate families), the Tovariaceae, Resedaceae, and Moringaceae.  Other taxa now included here were placed in various other orders.The families Capparaceae and Brassicaceae are closely related.  One group, consisting of Cleome and related genera, was traditionally included in the Capparaceae but doing so results in a paraphyletic Capparaceae.   Therefore, this group is generally now either included in the Brassicaceae or as its own family, Cleomaceae.  References External links   

Bulletin board system<====>3430<====>Bulletin board systemA bulletin board system or BBS is a computer server running software that allows users to connect to the system using a terminal program.  Once logged in, the user can perform functions such as uploading and downloading software and data, reading news and bulletins, and exchanging messages with other users through email, public message boards, and sometimes via direct chatting.  Many BBSes also offer on-line games in which users can compete with each other, and BBSes with multiple phone lines often provide chat rooms, allowing users to interact with each other.  Bulletin board systems were in many ways a precursor to the modern form of the World Wide Web, social networks, and other aspects of the Internet. 

String Quartet No. 16 (Beethoven)<====>3435<====>String Quartet No.  16 (Beethoven)The String Quartet No.  16 in F major, op.  135, by Ludwig van Beethoven  was written in October 1826    and was the last major work he completed.  Only the final movement of the Quartet op.  130,  written as a replacement for the Große Fuge, was composed later.  The op.  135 quartet was premiered by the Schuppanzigh Quartet in March 1828, one year after Beethoven's death.  The work is on a smaller scale than the other late quartets.  Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement Beethoven wrote in the manuscript "Muß es sein?" (Must it be?) to which he responds, with the faster main theme of the movement, "Es muß sein!" (It must be!).

Piano Trios, Op. 1 (Beethoven)<====>3437<====>Piano Trios, Op.  1 (Beethoven) Ludwig van Beethoven's Opus 1 is a set of three piano trios (written for piano, violin, and cello), first performed in 1795 in the house of Prince Lichnowsky, to whom they are dedicated.   The trios were published in 1795. Despite the Op.  1 designation, these trios were not Beethoven's first published compositions ; this distinction belongs rather to his Dressler Variations for keyboard (WoO 63).  Clearly he recognized these compositions as the earliest ones he had produced that were substantial enough (and marketable enough) to fill out a first major publication to introduce his style of writing to the musical public. 

Piano Trios, Op. 70 (Beethoven)<====>3438<====>Piano Trios, Op.  70 (Beethoven) Opus 70 is a set of two Piano Trios by Ludwig van Beethoven, written for piano, violin, and cello.  Both trios were composed during Beethoven's stay at Countess Marie von Erdödy's estate, and both are dedicated to her for her hospitality.  They were published in 1809. The first, in D major, known as the Ghost, is one of his best known works in the genre (rivaled only by the Archduke Trio).   The D major trio features themes found in the second movement of Beethoven's Symphony No.  2.   The All-Music Guide states that "because of its strangely scored and undeniably eerie-sounding slow movement,  it was dubbed the 'Ghost' Trio. 

Piano Trio, Op. 97 (Beethoven)<====>3439<====>Piano Trio, Op.  97 (Beethoven) The Piano Trio in B-flat major, Op.  97, by Ludwig van Beethoven is a piano trio completed in 1811.   It is commonly referred to as the Archduke Trio, because it was dedicated to Archduke Rudolph of Austria, the youngest of twelve children of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor.  Rudolf was an amateur pianist and a patron, friend, and composition student of Beethoven.  Beethoven dedicated a total of fourteen compositions to the Archduke, who dedicated one of his own to Beethoven in return. The trio was written late in Beethoven's so-called "middle period". 

Violin Sonata No. 5 (Beethoven)<====>3441<====>Violin Sonata No.  5 (Beethoven)The Violin Sonata No.  5 in F major, Opus 24, is a violin sonata by Ludwig van Beethoven.

It was dedicated to Count Moritz von Fries, a patron to whom Beethoven also dedicated two other works of the same year—the C major string quintet and the fourth violin sonata—as well as his later seventh symphony.  The work is in four movements:AllegroAdagio molto espressivoScherzo: Allegro moltoRondo: Allegro ma non troppoThe Scherzo and its trio are particularly brief.  The entire sonata takes approximately 22 minutes to perform.

Historically, the umbrella term was billiards.  While that familiar name is still employed by some as a generic label for all such games, the word's usage has splintered into more exclusive competing meanings in various parts of the world.  For example, in British and Australian English, "billiards" usually refers exclusively to the game of English billiards, while in American and Canadian English it is sometimes used to refer to a particular game or class of games, or to all cue games in general, depending upon dialect and context.

Blindness in literature<====>3600<====>Blindness in literature Different cultures through history have depicted blindness in a variety of ways; among the Greeks, for example, it was a punishment from the gods, for which the afflicted individual was often granted compensation in the form of artistic genius.

Almost without exception in early literature, blind people could bring this condition down upon themselves through sin or trespasses against the gods, but were never the sole instruments of its reversal.

Demographics of Burundi<====>3696<====>Demographics of Burundi This article is about the demographic features of the population of Burundi, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population. At 206. 1 persons per km². , Burundi has the second-largest population density in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Most people live on farms near areas of fertile volcanic soil.  The population is made up of three major ethnic groups – Hutu (Bahutu), Tutsi (Batutsi or Watusi), and Twa (Batwa).  Kirundi is the common language.  Intermarriage takes place frequently between the Hutus and Tutsis. 

Politics of Burundi<====>3697<====>Politics of Burundi  Politics of Burundi takes place in a framework of a transitional presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Burundi is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system.  Executive power is exercised by the government.  Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament, the Senate and the National Assembly. Political landscape after the civil warThe political landscape of Burundi has been dominated in recent years by the civil war and a long peace process and move to democracy.   The current President of Burundi is Pierre Nkurunziza, a former rebel leader of the Hutu National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy who was elected unopposed as the new President of Burundi by the parliament on 19 August 2005. 

Economy of Burundi<====>3698<====>Economy of Burundi Burundi is a landlocked, resource-poor country with an underdeveloped manufacturing sector.  The mainstay of the Burundian economy is agriculture, accounting for 54% of GDP in 1997.  Agriculture supports more than 70% of the labour force, the majority of whom are subsistence farmers.  Although Burundi is potentially self-sufficient in food production, the ongoing civil war, overpopulation, and soil erosion have contributed to the contraction of the subsistence economy by 25% in recent years.  Large numbers of internally displaced persons have been unable to produce their own food and are largely dependent on international humanitarian assistance.

Transport in Burundi<====>3700<====>Transport in BurundiThere are a number of systems of transport in Burundi, including road and water-based infrastructure, the latter of which makes use of Lake Tanganyika.   Furthermore, there are also some airports in Burundi. A great hindrance to Burundi’s economic development is lack of adequate transportation.  The country has limited ferry services on Lake Tanganyika, few road connections to neighboring countries, no rail connections, and only one airport with a paved runway.  Public transport is extremely limited and private bus companies operate buses on the route to Kigali but not to Tanzania or the Democratic Republic of Congo. 

Military of Burundi<====>3701<====>Military of Burundi The National Defence Force is the state military organisation responsible for the defence of Burundi. A general staff (État-Major Général) commands the armed forces, consisting of a joint staff (État-Major inter-armes); a training staff (État-Major de la Formation), and a logistics staff (État-Major de la Logistique).  Naval and aviation commands exist, as well as specialised units.    Burundi gained independence in July 1962.  In October 1965, an attempted coup d'état led by the Hutu-dominated police was carried out but failed.  The Tutsi dominated army, then led by Tutsi officer Captain Michel Micombero    purged Hutu from their ranks and carried out reprisal attacks which ultimately claimed the lives of up to 5,000 people in a predecessor to the 1972 Burundian Genocide. 

Foreign relations of Burundi<====>3702<====>Foreign relations of Burundi  Burundi's relations with its neighbours have often been affected by security concerns.  Hundreds of thousands of Burundian refugees have at various times crossed to neighboring Rwanda, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Hundreds of thousands of Burundians are in neighboring countries as a result of the ongoing civil war.  Most of them, more than 340,000 since 1993, are in Tanzania.  Some Burundian rebel groups have used neighboring countries as bases for insurgent activities.  The 1993 embargo placed on Burundi by regional states hurt diplomatic relations with its neighbors; relations have improved since the 1999 suspension of these sanctions. 

Bosphorus<====>3705<====>Bosphorus  The Bosphorus (  or  )  or Bosporus ( ;  , Bósporos, pronounced Vosporos in modern Greek;  ,  ) is a narrow, natural strait and an internationally significant waterway located in northwestern Turkey.  It forms part of the continental boundary between Europe and Asia, and separates Asian Turkey from European Turkey.  The world's narrowest strait used for international navigation, the Bosphorus connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara, and, by extension via the Dardanelles, the Aegean and  Mediterranean Seas. Most of the shores of the strait are heavily settled, straddled by the city of Istanbul's metropolitan population of 17 million inhabitants extending inland from both coasts.

Brain<====>3717<====>Brain    The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals.  The brain is located in the head, usually close to the sensory organs for senses such  as vision.  The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body.  In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 15–33 billion neurons,  each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons.  These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells. 

Byzantium<====>3719<====>Byzantium  Byzantium or Byzantion (  ;  , Byzántion) was an eastern Roman empire colony in early antiquity that later became Constantinople, and later Istanbul.   Byzantium was colonized from Megara in  . NameThe etymology of Byzantion is unknown.   It has been suggested that the name is of Thraco-Illyrian origin.It may be derived from a Thracian or Illyrian personal name, Byzas. Ancient Greek legend refers to a king Byzas, the leader of the Megarian colonists and founder of the city.  The form Byzantium is a Latinisation of the original name.

Bass (sound)<====>3727<====>Bass (sound)Bass describes tones of low (also called "deep") frequency, pitch and range from 16-256 Hz (C0 to middle C4).  In musical compositions, such as songs and pieces, these are the lowest parts of the harmony.  In choral music without instrumental accompaniment, the bass is supplied by adult male bass singers.  In an orchestra, the basslines are played by the double bass and cellos, bassoon or contrabassoon, low brass such as the tuba and bass trombone, and the timpani (kettledrums).  In many styles of traditional music such as Bluegrass, folk, and in styles such as Rockabilly and Big Band and Bebop jazz, the bass role is filled by the upright bass. 

Bass music<====>3728<====>Bass music  Bass music (also called UK bass or post-dubstep ) is an umbrella term for  electronic dance music that emerged in the United Kingdom during the mid-2000s under the influence of dubstep, UK garage, wonky, R&B, 2-step, house, grime, and other electronic styles that coalesced amongst varied artists.The phrase "bass music" came into use as artists began ambiguously blending the sounds of these defined genres while maintaining an emphasis on bass and rhythm.    OriginsThe breadth of styles that have come to be associated with the term preclude it from being a specific musical genre. 

Burning glass<====>3729<====>Burning glassA burning glass or burning lens is a large convex lens that can concentrate the sun's rays onto a small area, heating up the area and thus resulting in ignition of the exposed surface.  Burning mirrors achieve a similar effect by using reflecting surfaces to focus the light.  They were used in 18th-century chemical studies for burning materials in closed glass vessels where the products of combustion could be trapped for analysis.  The burning glass was a useful contrivance in the days before electrical ignition was easily achieved. HistoryThe technology of the burning glass has been known since antiquity. 

Beacon<====>3731<====>Beacon A beacon is an intentionally conspicuous device designed to attract attention to a specific location. Beacons can also be combined with semaphoric or other indicators to provide important information, such as the status of an airport, by the colour and rotational pattern of its airport beacon, or of pending weather as indicated on a weather beacon mounted at the top of a tall building or similar site.  When used in such fashion, beacons can be considered a form of optical telegraphy. For navigationBeacons help guide navigators to their destinations.  Types of navigational beacons include radar reflectors, radio beacons, sonic and visual signals. 

Bhangra (music)<====>3733<====>Bhangra (music)Bhaṅgṛā (  (Shahmukhi) , ਭੰਗੜਾ  (Gurmukhi) ;  ) is a type of upbeat popular music associated with British immigrant Punjabi youth.  It was invented in England starting in the 1980s by people from the Punjab region of India and Pakistan. HistoryOriginsThe roots of  modern bhangra music date back to the early 1980s, when several Punjabi bands started experimenting with Western styles as well as traditional Punjabi music.  Significant amongst these were 'The Black Mist', 'The Shots', 'The Jambo Boys', and 'The Saathies'.    However, the first recording artist/group of this type of music in the UK was Bhujhangy Group, founded by brothers Balbir Singh Khanpur and Dalbir Singh Khanpur in Birmingham in 1967. 

Beastie Boys<====>3735<====>Beastie Boys   Beastie Boys were an American hip hop group from New York City, formed in 1981.

Belgian Blue<====>3751<====>Belgian Blue The Belgian Blue ( ,  ) is a breed of beef cattle from Belgium.   It may also be known as the  .    Alternative names for this breed include Belgian Blue-White; Belgian White and Blue Pied; Belgian White Blue; Blue; and Blue Belgian.   The Belgian Blue's extremely lean, hyper-sculpted, ultra-muscular physique is termed "double-muscling".  The double-muscling phenotype is a heritable condition resulting in an increased number of muscle fibers (hyperplasia), instead of the (normal) enlargement of individual muscle fibers (hypertrophy).    This particular trait is shared with another breed of cattle known as Piedmontese. 

Boron<====>3755<====>Boron Boron is a chemical element with symbol B and atomic number 5.  Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in the Solar system and in the Earth's crust.   Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals.  These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite.  The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals. Elemental boron is a metalloid that is found in small amounts in meteoroids but chemically uncombined boron is not otherwise found naturally on Earth. 

Bromine<====>3756<====>Bromine Bromine is a chemical element with symbol Br and atomic number 35.  It is the third-lightest halogen, and is a fuming red-brown liquid at room temperature that evaporates readily to form a similarly coloured gas.  Its properties are thus intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine.  Isolated independently by two chemists, Carl Jacob Löwig (in 1825) and Antoine Jérôme Balard (in 1826), its name was derived from the Ancient Greek βρῶμος "stench", referencing its sharp and disagreeable smell. Elemental bromine is very reactive and thus does not occur free in nature, but in colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts, analogous to table salt. 

Barium<====>3757<====>Barium Barium is a chemical element with symbol Ba and atomic number 56.  It is the fifth element in group 2 and is a soft, silvery alkaline earth metal.  Because of its high chemical reactivity, barium is never found in nature as a free element.  Its hydroxide, known in pre-modern history as baryta, does not occur as a mineral, but can be prepared by heating barium carbonate. The most common naturally occurring minerals of barium are barite (barium sulfate, BaSO 4 ) and witherite (barium carbonate, BaCO 3 ), both insoluble in water.  The barium name originates from the alchemical derivative "baryta", from Greek βαρύς (barys), meaning "heavy. 

Berkelium<====>3758<====>Berkelium  Berkelium is a transuranic radioactive chemical element with symbol Bk and atomic number 97.  It is a member of the actinide and transuranium element series.  It is named after the city of Berkeley, California, the location of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory) where it was discovered in December 1949.  Berkelium was the fifth transuranium element discovered after neptunium, plutonium, curium and americium. The major isotope of berkelium,  249 Bk, is synthesized in minute quantities in dedicated high-flux nuclear reactors, mainly at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA, and at the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Dimitrovgrad, Russia. 

Bauxite<====>3760<====>Bauxite Bauxite, an aluminium ore, is the world's main source of aluminium.   It consists mostly of the minerals gibbsite (Al(OH) 3 ), boehmite (γ-AlO(OH)) and diaspore (α-AlO(OH)), mixed with the two iron oxides goethite and haematite, the clay mineral kaolinite and small amounts of anatase (TiO 2 ) and ilmenite (FeTiO 3  or FeO.

In 1861, French chemist Henri Sainte-Claire Deville named the mineral "bauxite".  Notes:In 1847, in the cumulative index of volume 3 of his series, Traité de minéralogie, French mineralogist Armand Dufrénoy listed the hydrated alumina from Les Beaux as "beauxite". 

Bavaria<====>3764<====>Bavaria    Bavaria (;  ), officially the Free State of Bavaria (   ) is a landlocked federal state of Germany, occupying its southeastern corner.  With an area of 70,550. 19 square kilometres (27,200 sq mi), Bavaria is the largest German state by land area.   Its territory comprises roughly a fifth of the total land area of Germany.  With 12. 9 million inhabitants, it is Germany's second-most-populous state (after North Rhine-Westphalia).  Bavaria's capital and largest city, Munich, is the third largest city in Germany.  The history of Bavaria stretches from its earliest settlement and formation as a duchy in the 6th century CE (AD) through the Holy Roman Empire to becoming an independent kingdom and finally a state of the Federal Republic of Germany. 

Brandenburg<====>3765<====>Brandenburg   Brandenburg ( ;  , Lower Sorbian: Bramborska,  ) is one of the sixteen federated states of Germany.

Book<====>3778<====>BookA book is a series of pages assembled for easy portability and reading, as well as the composition contained in it.  The most common modern form of book is a codex volume consisting of rectangular paper pages bound on one side, with a heavier cover and spine, so that it can fan open for reading.  Books have taken other forms, such as scrolls, leaves on a string, or strips tied together; and the pages have been of parchment, vellum, papyrus, bamboo slips, palm leaves, silk, wood, and other materials.  The contents of books are also called books, as are other compositions of that length.

Battle of Bosworth Field<====>3793<====>Battle of Bosworth FieldThe Battle of Bosworth Field (or Battle of Bosworth) was the last significant battle of the Wars of the Roses, the civil war between the Houses of Lancaster and York that raged across England in the latter half of the 15th century.  Fought on 22 August 1485, the battle was won by the Lancastrians.  Their leader Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, by his victory became the first English monarch of the Tudor dynasty.  His opponent, Richard III, the last king of the House of York, was killed in the battle. 

Brassicaceae<====>3794<====>Brassicaceae Brassicaceae or Cruciferae  is a medium-sized and economically important family of flowering plants commonly known as the mustards, the crucifers, or the cabbage family.  Most are herbaceous plants, some shrubs, with simple, although sometimes deeply incised, alternatingly set leaves without stipules or in leaf rosettes, with terminal inflorescences without bracts, containing flowers with four free sepals, four free alternating petals, two short and four longer free stamens, and a fruit with seeds in rows, divided by a thin wall (or septum). The family contains 372 genera and 4060 accepted species.   The largest genera are Draba (440 species), Erysimum (261 species), Lepidium (234 species), Cardamine (233 species), and Alyssum (207 species). 

Books of the Bible<====>3796<====>Books of the Bible   Different religious groups include different books in their Biblical canons, in varying orders, and sometimes divide or combine books.  Christian Bibles range from the 66 books of the Protestant canon to the 81 books of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church canon. The Tanakh (sometimes called the Hebrew Bible) contains 24 books divided into three parts: the five books of the Torah ("teaching"); the Nevi'im ("prophets"); and the Ketuvim ("writings").  The first part of Christian Bibles is called the Old Testament, which contains, at minimum, the above 24 books but divided into 39 books and ordered differently. 

Baseball statistics<====>3797<====>Baseball statisticsBaseball statistics play an important role in evaluating a player's and/or team's progress. Since the flow of a baseball game has natural breaks to it, and normally players act individually rather than performing in clusters, the sport lends itself to easy record-keeping and statistics.  Statistics have been kept for professional baseball since the creation of the National League and American League, now part of Major League Baseball. Many statistics are also available from outside Major League Baseball, from leagues such as the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players and the Negro Leagues, although the consistency of whether these records were kept, of the standards with respect to which they were calculated, and of their accuracy varied. 

At bat<====>3800<====>At bat  In baseball, an at bat (AB) or time at bat is a batter's turn batting against a pitcher.  An at bat is different from a plate appearance.  A batter is credited with a plate appearance regardless of what happens during his turn at bat.  A batter is credited with an at bat only if that plate appearance does not have one of the results enumerated below.  While at bats are used to calculate certain statistics, including batting average and slugging percentage, a player can qualify for the season-ending rankings in these categories only if he accumulates 502 plate appearances during the season. 

Earned run<====>3801<====>Earned runIn baseball, an earned run is any run that was fully enabled by the offensive team's production in the face of competent play from the defensive team.   Conversely, an unearned run is a run that would not have been scored without the aid of an error or a passed ball committed by the defense.   An unearned run counts just as much as any other run for the purpose of determining the score of the game.   However, it is "unearned" in that it was, in a sense, "given away" by the defensive team.  Both total runs and earned runs are tabulated as part of a pitcher's statistics. 

Base on balls<====>3802<====>Base on ballsA base on balls (BB), also known as a walk, occurs in baseball when a batter receives four pitches that the umpire calls balls, and is in turn awarded first base without the possibility of being called out.   The base on balls is defined in Section 2. 00 of baseball's Official Rules,  and further detail is given in 6. 08(a).    It is, however, considered a faux pas for a professional player to actually walk to first base; the batter-runner and any advancing runners normally jog on such a play.   The term "base on balls" distinguishes a walk from the other manners in which a batter can be awarded first base without liability to be put out (e. 

List of Major League Baseball career total bases leaders<====>3805<====>List of Major League Baseball career total bases leadersIn baseball statistics, total bases (TBs) is the number of bases a player has gained with hits.  It is a weighted sum for which the weight value is 1 for a single, 2 for a double, 3 for a triple and 4 for a home run.  Only bases attained from hits count toward this total.  Reaching base by other means (such as a base on balls) or advancing further after the hit (such as when a subsequent batter gets a hit) does not increase the player's total bases. The total bases divided by the number of at bats is the player's slugging average. 

Hit by pitch<====>3806<====>Hit by pitchIn baseball, hit by pitch (HBP) is a situation in which a batter or his clothing or equipment (other than his bat) is struck directly by a pitch from the pitcher; the batter is called a hit batsman (HB).  A hit batsman is awarded first base, provided that (in the plate umpire's judgment) he made an honest effort to avoid the pitch, although failure to do so is rarely called by an umpire.  Being hit by a pitch is often caused by a batter standing too close to, or "crowding", home plate. Official rulePer baseball official rule 5. 

Hit (baseball)<====>3807<====>Hit (baseball)In baseball statistics, a hit (denoted by H), also called a base hit, is credited to a batter when the batter safely reaches first base after hitting the ball into fair territory, without the benefit of an error or a fielder's choice. Scoring a hitTo achieve a hit, the batter must reach first base before any fielder can either tag him with the ball, throw to another player protecting the base before the batter reaches it, or tag first base while carrying the ball.  The hit is scored the moment the batter reaches first base safely; if he is put out while attempting to stretch his hit to a double or triple or home run on the same play, he still gets credit for a hit (according to the last base he reached safely on the play). 

On-base percentage<====>3808<====>On-base percentage In baseball statistics, on-base percentage (OBP; sometimes referred to as on-base average/OBA, as the statistic is rarely presented as a true percentage) is a statistic generally measuring how frequently a batter reaches base.  MLB Glossary  Specifically, it records the ratio of the batter's times-on-base (TOB) (the sum of hits, walks, and times hit by pitch) to their number of plate appearances.   It first became an official MLB statistic in 1984. By factoring in only hits, walks and times hit by pitch, OBP does not credit the batter for reaching base due to fielding errors or decisions, as it does not increase when the batter reaches base due to fielding error, fielder's choice, dropped/uncaught third strike, fielder's obstruction, or catcher's interference. 

Sacrifice fly<====>3809<====>Sacrifice fly In baseball, a sacrifice fly (sometimes abbreviated to sac fly) is a batted ball that satisfies four criteria:There are fewer than two outs when the ball is hit. The ball is hit to the outfield (fair or foul), or to infield foul territory. If there is a weak infield fly and 2 errors the batter will not get credited with an RBI. The batter is put out because an outfielder (or an infielder running in the outfield, or foul territory) catches the ball on the fly (alternatively if the batter would have been out if not for an error or if the outfielder drops the ball and another runner is put out). 

On-base plus slugging<====>3810<====>On-base plus slugging On-base plus slugging (OPS) is a sabermetric baseball statistic calculated as the sum of a player's on-base percentage and slugging average.   The ability of a player both to get on base and to hit for power, two important offensive skills, are represented.  An OPS of . 900 or higher in Major League Baseball puts the player in the upper echelon of hitters.  Typically, the league leader in OPS will score near, and sometimes above, the 1. 000 mark. EquationThe basic equation is OPS = OBP + SLG \,  where OBP is on-base percentage and SLG is slugging average. 

Stolen base<====>3811<====>Stolen baseIn baseball, a stolen base occurs when a runner advances to a base to which he is not entitled and the official scorer rules that the advance should be credited to the action of the runner.  The umpires determine whether the runner is safe or out at the next base, but the official scorer rules on the question of credit or blame for the advance under Rule 10.  A stolen base most often occurs when a base runner advances to the next base while the pitcher is pitching the ball to home plate. Successful base stealers are not only fast but have good baserunning instincts and timing. 

Plate appearance<====>3812<====>Plate appearance In baseball statistics, a player is credited with a plate appearance (denoted by PA) each time he completes a turn batting.   A player completes a turn batting when: he strikes out or is declared out before reaching first base; or he reaches first base safely or is awarded first base (by a base on balls, hit by pitch, or catcher's interference); or he hits a fair ball which causes a preceding runner to be put out for the third out before he himself is put out or reaches first base safely (see also left on base, fielder's choice, force play). 

Games played<====>3814<====>Games playedGames played (most often abbreviated as G or GP) is a statistic used in team sports to indicate the total number of games in which a player has participated (in any capacity); the statistic is generally applied irrespective of whatever portion of the game is contested. BaseballIn baseball, the statistic applies also to players who, prior to a game, are included on a starting lineup card or are announced as ex ante substitutes, whether or not they play,  although, in Major League Baseball, the application of this statistic does not extend to consecutive games played streaks.  A starting pitcher, then, may be credited with a game played even as he is not credited with a game started or an inning pitched. 

Boogie Down Productions<====>3817<====>Boogie Down Productions  Boogie Down Productions was a hip hop group, originally composed of KRS-One, D-Nice, and DJ Scott La Rock.  DJ Scott La Rock was murdered on August 27, 1987, five months after the release of BDP's debut album, Criminal Minded.  The name of the group, Boogie Down, derives from a nickname for the South Bronx section of The Bronx, one of the five boroughs of New York City.  The group pioneered the fusion of dancehall reggae and hip hop music and their debut LP Criminal Minded contained frank descriptions of life in the South Bronx during the late 1980s, thus setting the stage for what would eventually become gangsta rap. 

Binary-coded decimal<====>3821<====>Binary-coded decimal In computing and electronic systems, binary-coded decimal (BCD) is a class of binary encodings of decimal numbers where each decimal digit is represented by a fixed number of bits, usually four or eight.  Special bit patterns are sometimes used for a sign or for other indications (e. g. , error or overflow). In byte-oriented systems (i. e.  most modern computers), the term unpacked BCD  usually implies a full byte for each digit (often including a sign), whereas packed BCD typically encodes two decimal digits within a single byte by taking advantage of the fact that four bits are enough to represent the range 0 to 9.

Beowulf<====>3833<====>Beowulf Beowulf (   ) is an Old English epic poem consisting of 3,182 alliterative lines.  It may be the oldest surviving long poem in Old English and is commonly cited as one of the most important works of Old English literature.  A date of composition is a matter of contention among scholars; the only certain dating pertains to the manuscript, which was produced between 975 and 1025.   The author was an anonymous Anglo-Saxon poet, referred to by scholars as the "Beowulf poet".  The poem is set in Scandinavia.

Banjo<====>3846<====>Banjo   The banjo is a four-, five- or six-stringed instrument with a thin membrane stretched over a frame or cavity as a resonator, called the head.  The membrane, or head, is typically made of plastic, although animal skin is still occasionally but rarely used, and the frame is typically circular.  Early forms of the instrument were fashioned by Africans in America, adapted from African instruments of similar design.  The banjo is frequently associated with country, folk, Irish traditional, and country music.  Historically, the banjo occupied a central place in African American traditional music, before becoming popular in the minstrel shows of the 19th century. 

Baseball<====>3850<====>Baseball  Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each who take turns batting and fielding.  The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball (that is thrown by the opposing team's pitcher) with a bat swung by the batter, and then running counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate.  A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and touches home plate. Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. 

Baseball positions<====>3851<====>Baseball positions There are nine fielding positions in baseball. Each position conventionally has an associated number, which is used to score putouts:1 (pitcher), 2 (catcher), 3 (first baseman), 4 (second baseman), 5 (third baseman), 6 (shortstop), 7 (left fielder), 8 (center fielder), and 9 (right fielder). For example:If the third baseman fields a ball and throws it to first, it is recorded as a 5–3 out.A double play where the second baseman fields, throws to the shortstop covering second base, who throws to the 1st baseman is recorded as a 4–6–3 double play.Other roles Designated hitterPinch hitterPinch runnerUtility infielderUtility playersStarting pitcherRelief pitcherLeft-handed specialistLong relieverMiddle relieverSetup pitcher (setup man)Closer Other team personnel ManagerCoachesTrainerEquipment managerGeneral managerBatboyBall boy/girlTeam physician See also Infield shiftAce (baseball)Baseball positioningBatterBatting (baseball)Fielding percentagePlayer-coachPosition playerStarting lineupMascotOfficial scorerSports commentatorSports medicineUmpireBaseball awardsBaseball clothing and equipmentBaseball cultureBaseball jargonBaseball scorekeepingBaseball statisticsBaseball terminology References    DEFAULTSORT

History of baseball in the United States<====>3856<====>History of baseball in the United States  The history of baseball in the United States can be traced to the 19th century, when amateurs played a baseball-like game by their own informal rules using homemade equipment.  The popularity of the sport inspired the semi-pro national baseball clubs in the 1860s. Early historyThe earliest known mention of baseball in the U. S was a 1791 Pittsfield, Massachusetts, ordinance banning the playing of the game within   of the town meeting house.   In 1903, the British sportswriter Henry Chadwick published an article speculating that baseball derived from a British game called rounders, which Chadwick had played as a boy in England. 

Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award<====>3858<====>Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award The Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) is an annual Major League Baseball (MLB) award, given to one outstanding player in the American League and one in the National League.  Since 1931, it has been awarded by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA).  The winners receive the Kenesaw Mountain Landis Memorial Baseball Award, which became the official name of the award in 1944,    in honor of the first MLB commissioner, who served from 1920 until his death on November 25, 1944.MVP voting takes place before the postseason, but the results are not announced until after the World Series. 

Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award<====>3859<====>Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award In Major League Baseball, the Rookie of the Year Award is annually given to one player from each league as voted on by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA).  The award was established in 1940 by the Chicago chapter of the BBWAA, which selected an annual winner from 1940 through 1946.The award became national in 1947; Jackie Robinson, the Brooklyn Dodgers' second baseman, won the inaugural award.  One award was presented for both leagues in 1947 and 1948; since 1949, the honor has been given to one player each in the National and American League. 

National League Championship Series<====>3860<====>National League Championship Series   The National League Championship Series (NLCS) is a best-of-seven series played in October in the Major League Baseball postseason that determines the winner of the National League (NL) pennant.  The winner of the series advances to play the winner of the American League Championship Series (ALCS) in the World Series, Major League Baseball's championship series. HistoryPrior to 1969, the National League champion (the "pennant winner") was determined by the best win-loss record at the end of the regular season.  There were four ad hoc three-game playoff series due to ties under this formulation (in 1946, 1951, 1959, and 1962). 

American League Championship Series<====>3861<====>American League Championship Series   The American League Championship Series (ALCS) is a best-of-seven series played in October in the Major League Baseball postseason that determines the winner of the American League (AL) pennant.  The winner of the series advances to play the winner of the National League (NL) Championship Series (NLCS) in the World Series, Major League Baseball's championship series. HistoryIt started in 1969, when the AL reorganized into two divisions, East and West.  The winners of each division played each other in a best-of-five series to determine who would advance to the World Series.  In 1985, the format changed to best-of-seven. 

American League Division Series<====>3862<====>American League Division Series In Major League Baseball, the American League Division Series (ALDS) determines which teams will play in the American League Championship Series (ALCS).  It is played in a best-of-five format. HistoryThe Division Series was implemented in 1981 as a result of a midseason strike, with the first place teams before the strike taking on the teams in first place after the strike.  After 1993, it was implemented for good when Major League Baseball restructured each league into three divisions.  In 1981, a split-season format forced the first ever divisional playoff series, in which the New York Yankees won the Eastern Division series over the Milwaukee Brewers (who were in the American League until 1998) in five games while in the Western Division, the Oakland Athletics swept the Kansas City Royals (the only team with an overall losing record to ever make the postseason). 

National League Division Series<====>3863<====>National League Division Series In Major League Baseball, the National League Division Series (NLDS) determines which two teams from the National League will advance to the National League Championship Series.  The Division Series consists of two best-of-five series, featuring the three division winners and the winner of the wild-card play-off. History The Division Series was implemented in 1981 – for only one year – as a result of a midseason strike with first-place teams before the strike taking on the first-place teams after.   After 1993, Major League Baseball decided to implement the Division Series permanently, because it was restructuring each league into three divisions. 

2001 World Series<====>3864<====>2001 World Series  The 2001 World Series was the 97th edition of Major League Baseball's championship series,    a best-of-seven playoff between the National League (NL) champion Arizona Diamondbacks and the three-time defending World Series champions and American League (AL) champion New York Yankees.  The Diamondbacks defeated the Yankees four games to three to win the best-of-seven series.  Considered one of the greatest World Series of all time,    memorable aspects included two extra-inning games and three late-inning comebacks.  It ended on a Game 7 walk-off hit in the form of a bases-loaded blooper single off the bat of Luis Gonzalez. 

1903 World Series<====>3865<====>1903 World Series The 1903 World Series was the first modern World Series to be played in Major League Baseball.  It matched the Boston Americans of the American League against the Pittsburg Pirates  of the National League in a best-of-nine series, with Boston prevailing five games to three, winning the last four. Pittsburg pitcher Sam Leever injured his shoulder while trap-shooting, so his teammate Deacon Phillippe pitched five complete games.  Phillippe won three of his games, but it was not enough to overcome the club from the new American League.  Boston pitchers Bill Dinneen and Cy Young led Boston to victory. 

Bluetongue disease<====>3866<====>Bluetongue disease  Bluetongue disease is a non-contagious, insect-borne, viral disease of ruminants, mainly sheep and less frequently cattle,  goats, buffalo, deer, dromedaries, and antelope.  It is caused by the Bluetongue virus (BTV).   The virus is transmitted by the midge Culicoides imicola, Culicoides variipennis, and other culicoids. SignsIn sheep, BTV causes an acute disease with high morbidity and mortality.  BTV also infects goats, cattle and other domestic animals as well as wild ruminants (for example, blesbuck, white-tailed deer, elk, and pronghorn antelope).  Major signs are high fever, excessive salivation, swelling of the face  and tongue and cyanosis of the tongue.

He created The Open Source Definition and published the first formal announcement and manifesto of open source. He co-founded the Open Source Initiative (OSI) with Eric S.  Raymond.  In 2005, Perens represented Open Source at the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society, at the invitation of the United Nations Development Programme.  He has appeared before national legislatures and is often quoted in the press, advocating for open source and the reform of national and international technology policy. 

Bundle theory<====>3870<====>Bundle theory Bundle theory, originated by the 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume, is the ontological theory about objecthood in which an object consists only of a collection (bundle) of properties, relations or tropes. According to bundle theory, an object consists of its properties and nothing more: thus neither can there be an object without properties nor can one even conceive of such an object; for example, bundle theory claims that thinking of an apple compels one also to think of its color, its shape, the fact that it is a kind of fruit, its cells, its taste, or at least one other of its properties. 

Bernard Montgomery<====>3873<====>Bernard Montgomery   Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein,   ( ; 17 November 1887 – 24 March 1976), nicknamed "Monty" and "The Spartan General",  was a senior British Army officer who fought in both the First World War and the Second World War. He saw action in the First World War as a junior officer of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment.  At Méteren, near the Belgian border at Bailleul, he was shot through the right lung by a sniper, during the First Battle of Ypres.  He returned to the Western Front as a general staff officer and took part in the Battle of Arras in April/May 1917.

He is regarded as the founder of clinical teaching and of the modern academic hospital and is sometimes referred to as "the father of physiology," along with Venetian physician Santorio Santorio (1561–1636).  Boerhaave introduced the quantitative approach into medicine, along with his pupil Albrecht von Haller (1708–1777) and is best known for demonstrating the relation of symptoms to lesions. 

Benjamin Disraeli<====>3875<====>Benjamin DisraeliBenjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield,   (21 December 1804 – 19 April 1881) was a British statesman of the Conservative Party who twice served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.  He played a central role in the creation of the modern Conservative Party, defining its policies and its broad outreach.  Disraeli is remembered for his influential voice in world affairs, his political battles with the Liberal Party leader William Ewart Gladstone, and his one-nation conservatism or "Tory democracy".  He made the Conservatives the party most identified with the glory and power of the British Empire. 

Binomial distribution<====>3876<====>Binomial distribution    In probability theory and statistics, the binomial distribution with parameters n and p is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent experiments, each asking a yes–no question, and each with its own boolean-valued outcome: a random variable containing single bit of information:  /yes/true/one (with probability p) or failure/no/false/zero (with probability q = 1 − p).  A single success/failure experiment is also called a Bernoulli trial or Bernoulli experiment and a sequence of outcomes is called a Bernoulli process; for a single trial, i. e. , n = 1, the binomial distribution is a Bernoulli distribution. 

Biostatistics<====>3878<====>Biostatistics Biostatistics is the application of statistics to a wide range of topics in biology.  It encompasses the design of biological experiments, especially in medicine, pharmacy, agriculture and fishery; the collection, summarization, and analysis of data from those experiments; and the interpretation of, and inference from, the results.  A major branch is medical biostatistics, which is exclusively concerned with medicine and health.  History Biostatistical modeling forms an important part of numerous modern biological theories.  In the early 1900s, after the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's Mendelian inheritance work, the gaps in understanding between genetics and evolutionary Darwinism led to vigorous debate between biometricians, such as Walter Weldon and Karl Pearson, and Mendelians, such as Charles Davenport, William Bateson and Wilhelm Johannsen.

British and Irish Lions<====>3914<====>British and Irish Lions    The British & Irish Lions is a rugby union team selected from players eligible for any of the Home Nations – the national teams of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.  The Lions are a Test side, and generally select international players, but they can pick uncapped players available to any one of the four unions.  The team currently tours every four years, with these rotating among Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.  The 2009 Test series was lost   to South Africa, while the 2013 Test series was won   over Australia. 

Bass guitar<====>3916<====>Bass guitarThe bass guitar  (also known as electric bass,    or bass) is a stringed instrument played primarily with the fingers or thumb, by plucking, slapping, popping, strumming, tapping, thumping, or picking with a plectrum, often known as a pick. The bass guitar is similar in appearance and construction to an electric guitar, but with a longer neck and scale length, and four to six strings or courses.  The four-string bass, by far the most common, is usually tuned the same as the double bass,  which corresponds to pitches one octave lower than the four lowest pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G). 

Basketball<====>3921<====>BasketballBasketball is a limited-contact sport played on a rectangular court.  While most often played as a team sport with five players on each side, three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one competitions are also common.  The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop   in diameter and   high that is mounted to a backboard at each end of the court.  The game was invented in 1891 by Dr.  James Naismith. A team can score a field goal by shooting the ball through the basket being defended by the opposition team during regular play. 

Ball<====>3928<====>BallA ball is a round object (usually spherical but sometimes ovoid)  with various uses.  It is used in ball games, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players.  Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch, marbles and juggling.  Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in engineering applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as ball bearings.  Black-powder weapons use stone and metal balls as projectiles. Although many types of balls are today made from rubber, this form was unknown outside the Americas until after the voyages of Columbus. 

Binary relation<====>3931<====>Binary relation In mathematics, a binary relation on a set A is a collection of ordered pairs of elements of A.  In other words, it is a subset of the Cartesian product A 2  =  .  More generally, a binary relation between two sets A and B is a subset of  .  The terms correspondence, dyadic relation and 2-place relation are synonyms for binary relation. An example is the "divides" relation between the set of prime numbers P and the set of integers Z, in which every prime p is associated with every integer z that is a multiple of p (but with no integer that is not a multiple of p). 

Braille<====>3933<====>BrailleBraille ( ;  ) is a tactile writing system used by people who are visually impaired.  It is traditionally written with embossed paper.  Braille users can read computer screens and other electronic supports thanks to refreshable braille displays.  They can write braille with the original slate and stylus or type it on a braille writer, such as a portable braille notetaker or computer that prints with a braille embosser. Braille is named after its creator, Louis Braille, a Frenchman who lost his sight as a result of a childhood accident.  In 1824, at the age of fifteen, he developed a code for the French alphabet as an improvement on night writing. 

Bastille Day<====>3936<====>Bastille Day    Bastille Day is the common name given in English-speaking countries/lands to the French National Day, which is celebrated on the 14th of July each year.  In France, it is formally called   ( ; The National Celebration) and commonly and legally( ; the 14th of July). The French National Day commemorates the first anniversary of Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789,  a turning point of the French Revolution,    as well as the Fête de la Fédération which celebrated the unity of the French people on 14 July 1790. 

Blowfish (cipher)<====>3940<====>Blowfish (cipher)   Blowfish is a symmetric-key block cipher, designed in 1993 by Bruce Schneier and included in a large number of cipher suites and encryption products.  Blowfish provides a good encryption rate in software and no effective cryptanalysis of it has been found to date.  However, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) now receives more attention, and Schneier recommends Twofish for modern applications.  Schneier designed Blowfish as a general-purpose algorithm, intended as an alternative to the aging DES and free of the problems and constraints associated with other algorithms.  At the time Blowfish was released, many other designs were proprietary, encumbered by patents or were commercial or government secrets. 

Bijection<====>3942<====>Bijection In mathematics, a bijection, bijective function, or one-to-one correspondence is a function between the elements of two sets, where each element of one set is paired with exactly one element of the other set, and each element of the other set is paired with exactly one element of the first set.  There are no unpaired elements.  In mathematical terms, a bijective function f: X → Y is a one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective) mapping of a set X to a set Y. A bijection from the set X to the set Y has an inverse function from Y to X. 

Binary function<====>3943<====>Binary function In mathematics, a binary function (also called bivariate function, or function of two variables) is a function that takes two inputs. Precisely stated, a function  f  is binary if there exists sets  X, Y, Z  such that \,f \colon X \times Y \rightarrow Z where  X \times Y  is the Cartesian product of  X  and  Y.  Alternative definitionsSet-theoretically, one may represent a binary function as a subset of the Cartesian product X × Y × Z, where (x,y,z) belongs to the subset if and only if f(x,y) = z. 

Blue Velvet (film)<====>3947<====>Blue Velvet (film)   Blue Velvet is a 1986 American neo-noir mystery film, written and directed by David Lynch.  Blending psychological horror   with film noir, the film stars Kyle MacLachlan, Isabella Rossellini, Dennis Hopper and Laura Dern.  The title is taken from Bobby Vinton's 1963 song of the same name. The screenplay of Blue Velvet had been passed around multiple times in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with many major studios declining it because of its strong sexual and violent content.After the commercial and critical failure of Lynch's Dune (1984), the director made attempts at developing a more "personal story," somewhat characteristic of the surrealist style displayed in his debut Eraserhead (1977). 

Binary operation<====>3948<====>Binary operation In mathematics, a binary operation on a set is a calculation that combines two elements of the set (called operands) to produce another element of the set.  More formally, a binary operation is an operation of arity two whose two domains and one codomain are the same set.   Examples include the familiar elementary arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.   Other examples are readily found in different areas of mathematics, such as vector addition, matrix multiplication and conjugation in groups. TerminologyMore precisely, a binary operation on a set S is a map which sends elements of the Cartesian product   to S:    \,f \colon S \times S \rightarrow S. 

Bagpipes<====>3950<====>Bagpipes  Bagpipes are a wind instrument using enclosed reeds fed from a constant reservoir of air in the form of a bag.  Though the Scottish Great Highland bagpipes are the best known in the Anglophone world, bagpipes have been played for a millennium or more throughout large parts of Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia, including Turkey, the Caucasus, and around the Persian Gulf.  The term bagpipe is equally correct in the singular or plural, though pipers usually refer to the bagpipes as "the pipes", "a set of pipes" or "a stand of pipes". Construction  A set of bagpipes minimally consists of an air supply, a bag, a chanter, and usually at least one drone. 

Bedrock Records<====>3952<====>Bedrock Records    Bedrock Records is an English record label for trance, house and techno started by Nick Muir and John Digweed.

Bedrock Records has released many singles from artists such as Astro & Glyde, Brancaccio & Aisher, Steve Lawler, Shmuel Flash, Steve Porter, Guy J, Henry Saiz, Stelios Vassiloudis, Electric Rescue, The Japanese Popstars and Jerry Bonham.   Bedrock is also the name that Digweed and Muir use as their production moniker. Bedrock in the past had different Sub-labels: Bedrock Breaks, B_Rock and Black (Bedrock). 

Biochemistry<====>3954<====>Biochemistry  Biochemistry, sometimes called biological chemistry, is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms.   By controlling information flow through biochemical signaling and the flow of chemical energy through metabolism, biochemical processes give rise to the complexity of life.  Over the last decades of the 20th century, biochemistry has become so successful at explaining living processes that now almost all areas of the life sciences from botany to medicine to genetics are engaged in biochemical research.  Voet (2005), p.  3.   Today, the main focus of pure biochemistry is on understanding how biological molecules give rise to the processes that occur within living cells, Karp (2009), p. 

Badminton<====>3956<====>BadmintonBadminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net.  Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side).  Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court.  Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court. Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. 

Baroque<====>3957<====>Baroque  The Baroque (  or  ) is a highly ornate and often extravagant style of architecture, art and music that flourished in Europe from the early 17th until the late 18th century.  Oxford English Dictionary on-line   It followed the Renaissance style and preceded the Neoclassical style.  It was encouraged by the Roman Catholic Church as a means to counter the simplicity and austerity of Protestant architecture, art and music.  The baroque style used contrast, movement,  exuberant detail, grandeur and surprise to achieve a sense of awe.    The style began in the first third of the 17th century in Rome,  then spread rapidly to northern Italy, Spain and Portugal, then to Austria and southern Germany. 

Boolean algebra (structure)<====>3959<====>Boolean algebra (structure)  In abstract algebra, a Boolean algebra or Boolean lattice is a complemented distributive lattice.  This type of algebraic structure captures essential properties of both set operations and logic operations.  A Boolean algebra can be seen as a generalization of a power set algebra or a field of sets, or its elements can be viewed as generalized truth values.  It is also a special case of a De Morgan algebra and a Kleene algebra (with involution). Every Boolean algebra gives rise to a Boolean ring, and vice versa, with ring multiplication corresponding to conjunction or meet ∧, and ring addition to exclusive disjunction or symmetric difference (not disjunction ∨).

Bandwidth (signal processing)<====>3967<====>Bandwidth (signal processing) Bandwidth is the difference between the upper and lower frequencies in a continuous set of frequencies.   It is typically measured in hertz, and may sometimes refer to passband bandwidth, sometimes to baseband bandwidth, depending on context.  Passband bandwidth is the difference between the upper and lower cutoff frequencies of, for example, a band-pass filter, a communication channel, or a signal spectrum.  In the case of a low-pass filter or baseband signal, the bandwidth is equal to its upper cutoff frequency. Bandwidth in hertz is a central concept in many fields, including electronics, information theory, digital communications, radio communications, signal processing, and spectroscopy and is one of the determinants of the capacity of a given communication channel. 

Bodhisattva<====>3968<====>Bodhisattva    In Buddhism, Bodhisattva (   )  is the Sanskrit term for anyone who, motivated by great compassion, has generated Bodhicitta, which is a spontaneous wish and a compassionate mind to attain Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings.   Bodhisattvas are a popular subject in Buddhist art. Origins and outlinesIn early Indian Buddhism, the term bodhisattva was primarily used to refer specifically to Gautama Buddha in his former life.   The Jataka tales, which are the stories of the Buddha's past lives, depict the various attempts of the bodhisattva to embrace qualities like self-sacrifice and morality. 

Buckingham Palace<====>3969<====>Buckingham Palace    Buckingham Palace (   ) is the London residence and administrative headquarters of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom. Located in the City of Westminster, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality.

A   is called a cyclist, or bicyclist.  Bicycles were introduced in the late 19th century in Europe, and by the early 21st century, more than 1 billion have been produced worldwide.These numbers far exceed the number of cars, both in total and ranked by the number of individual models produced.    They are the principal means of transportation in many regions. 

Biopolymer<====>3974<====>Biopolymer Biopolymers are polymers produced by living organisms; in other words, they are polymeric biomolecules.  Since they are polymers, biopolymers contain monomeric units that are covalently bonded to form larger structures.  There are three main classes of biopolymers, classified according to the monomeric units used and the structure of the biopolymer formed: polynucleotides (RNA and DNA), which are long polymers composed of 13 or more nucleotide monomers; polypeptides, which are short polymers of amino acids; and polysaccharides, which are often linear bonded polymeric carbohydrate structures.

Under the leadership of Tony Blair, the governing Labour Party was re-elected to serve a second term in government with another landslide victory, returning 413 of the 418 seats won by the party in the previous general election, a net loss of 5 seats, though with significantly lower turnout than before - 59. 4%, compared to 71. 

Book of Mormon<====>3978<====>Book of Mormon  The Book of Mormon is a sacred text of the Latter Day Saint movement, which adherents believe contains writings of ancient prophets who lived on the American continent from approximately 2200 BC to AD 421.    It was first published in March 1830 by Joseph Smith as The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi.  According to Smith's account and the book's narrative, the Book of Mormon was originally written in otherwise unknown characters referred to as "reformed Egyptian"  engraved on golden plates. 

Baptists<====>3979<====>BaptistsBaptists are Christians distinguished by baptizing professing believers only (believer's baptism, as opposed to infant baptism), and doing so by complete immersion (as opposed to affusion or sprinkling).  Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the tenets of soul competency/liberty, salvation through faith alone, scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local congregation.  Baptists generally recognize two ordinances, baptism and the Lord's supper.  Frank S.  Mead and Samuel Hill.  Handbook of Denominations 9th Edition.  p.  36.  quote: "[Baptist groups] are generally agreed upon the following. 

Blackjack<====>3981<====>Blackjack   Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is a comparing card game between usually several players and a dealer, where each player in turn competes against the dealer, but players do not play against each other.  It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards, and is the most widely played casino banking game in the world.   The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a "blackjack" or "natural"), without a dealer blackjack;Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; orLet the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21. 

Bicarbonate<====>3982<====>Bicarbonate   In inorganic chemistry, bicarbonate (IUPAC-recommended nomenclature: hydrogencarbonate ) is an intermediate form in the deprotonation of carbonic acid.  It is a polyatomic anion with the chemical formula  . Bicarbonate serves a crucial biochemical role in the physiological pH buffering system.    The term "bicarbonate" was coined in 1814 by the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston.    The prefix "bi" in "bicarbonate" comes from an outdated naming system and is based on the observation that there is twice as much carbonate ( ) per sodium ion in sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 ) and other bicarbonates than in sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3 ) and other carbonates.

Benjamin Franklin<====>3986<====>Benjamin FranklinBenjamin Franklin   ( April 17, 1790) was a renowned polymath and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.  Franklin was a leading author, printer, political theorist, politician, freemason, postmaster, scientist, inventor, humorist, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat.  As a scientist, he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity.  As an inventor, he is known for the lightning rod, bifocals, and the Franklin stove, among other inventions.   He founded many civic organizations, including Philadelphia's fire department and the University of Pennsylvania. 

Banach space<====>3989<====>Banach spaceIn mathematics, more specifically in functional analysis, a Banach space (pronounced  ) is a complete normed vector space.  Thus, a Banach space is a vector space with a metric that allows the computation of vector length and distance between vectors and is complete in the sense that a Cauchy sequence of vectors always converges to a well defined limit that is within the space. Banach spaces are named after the Polish mathematician Stefan Banach, who introduced this concept and studied it systematically in 1920–1922 along with Hans Hahn and Eduard Helly.   Banach spaces originally grew out of the study of function spaces by Hilbert, Fréchet, and Riesz earlier in the century. 

Bram Stoker<====>3992<====>Bram Stoker   Abraham "Bram" Stoker (8 November 1847 – 20 April 1912) was an Irish  author, best known today for his 1897 Gothic novel Dracula.  During his lifetime, he was better known as the personal assistant of actor Henry Irving and business manager of the Lyceum Theatre in London, which Irving owned. Early lifeStoker was born on 8 November 1847 at 15 Marino Crescent, Clontarf, on the northside of Dublin, Ireland.    His parents were Abraham Stoker (1799–1876) from Dublin and Charlotte Mathilda Blake Thornley (1818–1901), who was raised in County Sligo.   Stoker was the third of seven children, the eldest of whom was Sir Thornley Stoker, 1st Bt. 

Contract bridge<====>3995<====>Contract bridge  Contract bridge, or simply bridge, is a trick-taking card game using a standard 52-card deck.  It is played by four players in two competing partnerships,  , page 1.   with partners sitting opposite each other around a table.   Millions of people play bridge worldwide in clubs, tournaments, online and with friends at home, making it one of the world's most popular card games, particularly among seniors.    The World Bridge Federation (WBF) is the governing body for international competitive bridge, with numerous other bodies governing bridge at the regional level. 

Boat<====>3996<====>Boat  A boat is a watercraft of a large range of sizes designed to float, plane, work or travel on water.  Small boats are typically found on inland waterways (e. g.  rivers and lakes) or in protected coastal areas.  However, boats such as the whaleboat were designed for operation as a ship in an offshore environment.  In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard another vessel (a ship).  An older tradition is that a ship has a weather deck fully enclosing the hull space, while a boat lacks a full weather deck; this is suggested as the reason why submarines are referred to as 'boats' rather than 'ships', as a cylindrical hull has interior decks but no weatherdeck. 

Blood<====>3997<====>Blood    Blood is a body fluid in humans and other animals that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells.  In vertebrates, it is composed of blood cells suspended in blood plasma.  Plasma, which constitutes 55% of blood fluid, is mostly water (92% by volume),    and contains dissipated proteins, glucose, mineral ions, hormones, carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation), and blood cells themselves.  Albumin is the main protein in plasma, and it functions to regulate the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood. 

Benoit Mandelbrot<====>3999<====>Benoit Mandelbrot   Benoit B.    Mandelbrot Pronouncedin English.   When speaking in French, Mandelbrot pronounced his name  .   (20 November 1924 – 14 October 2010) was a Polish-born, French and American polymath with broad interests in the practical sciences, especially regarding what he labeled as "the art of roughness" of physical phenomena and "the uncontrolled element in life". He referred to himself as a "fractalist".   He is recognized for his contribution to the field of fractal geometry, which included coining the word "fractal", as well as developing a theory of "roughness and self-similarity" in nature. 

Benedict of Nursia<====>4001<====>Benedict of NursiaBenedict of Nursia ( ;  ; Vulgar Latin: *Benedecto;  ;   2 March 480 – 543 or 547 AD) is a Christian saint, who is venerated in the Eastern Orthodox Churches, the Catholic Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, the Anglican Communion and Old Catholic Churches.He is a patron saint of Europe.Benedict founded twelve communities for monks at Subiaco, Lazio, Italy (about   to the east of Rome), before moving to Monte Cassino in the mountains of southern Italy.  The Order of Saint Benedict is of later origin and, moreover, not an "order" as commonly understood but merely a confederation of autonomous congregations. 

Battle of Pharsalus<====>4005<====>Battle of Pharsalus    The Battle of Pharsalus was a decisive battle of Caesar's Civil War.  On 9 August 48 BC at Pharsalus in central Greece, Gaius Julius Caesar and his allies formed up opposite the army of the republic under the command of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great").  Pompey had the backing of a majority of the senators, of whom many were optimates, and his army significantly outnumbered the veteran Caesarian legions. The two armies confronted each other over several months of uncertainty, Caesar being in a much weaker position than Pompey. The former found himself isolated in a hostile country with only 22,000 men and short of provisions, while on the other side of the river he was faced by Pompey with an army about twice as large in number. 

Bigfoot<====>4009<====>Bigfoot Bigfoot (also known as Sasquatch) is a cryptid in American folklore, supposedly a simian-like creature    that inhabits forests, especially those of the Pacific Northwest.  Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, bipedal humanoid.  The term sasquatch is an Anglicized derivative of the Halkomelem word sásq'ets. Scientists discount the existence of Bigfoot and consider it to be a combination of folklore, misidentification, and hoax,  rather than a living animal.  They note the lack of physical evidence after centuries of investigation, despite the fact that numerous creatures would have to exist in order to maintain a breeding population. 

Bing Crosby<====>4010<====>Bing Crosby  Harry  Lillis "Bing" Crosby Jr.  ( ; May 3, 1903 – October 14, 1977) Giddins 2001, pp.  30–31.    was an American singer and actor. Crosby's trademark warm bass-baritone voice made him one of the best-selling recording artists of all time, having sold over one billion analog records and tapes, and digital compact discs and downloads around the world. The first multimedia star, from 1931 to 1954 Crosby was a leader in record sales, radio ratings, and motion picture grosses.   His early career coincided with technical recording innovations such as the microphone.

Basel Convention<====>4012<====>Basel Convention   The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, usually known as the Basel Convention, is an international treaty that was designed to reduce the movements of hazardous waste between nations, and specifically to prevent transfer of hazardous waste from developed to less developed countries (LDCs).  It does not, however, address the movement of radioactive waste.  The Convention is also intended to minimize the amount and toxicity of wastes generated, to ensure their environmentally sound management as closely as possible to the source of generation, and to assist LDCs in environmentally sound management of the hazardous and other wastes they generate. 

Bar Kokhba (album)<====>4013<====>Bar Kokhba (album)  Bar Kokhba is a double album by John Zorn, recorded between 1994 and 1996.   It features music from Zorn's Masada project, rearranged for small ensembles.   It also features the original soundtrack from The Art of Remembrance – Simon Wiesenthal, a film by Hannah Heer and Werner Schmiedel (1994–95). ReceptionThe AllMusic review by Marc Gilman awarded the album 4½ stars noting that "While some compositions retain their original structure and sound, some are expanded and probed by Zorn's arrangements, and resemble avant-garde classical music more than jazz.  But this is the beauty of the album; the ensembles provide a forum for Zorn to expand his compositions. 

BASIC<====>4015<====>BASIC  BASIC (an acronym for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)  is a family of general-purpose, high-level programming languages whose design philosophy emphasizes ease of use.  In 1964, John G.  Kemeny and Thomas E.  Kurtz designed the original BASIC language at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, United States.  They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers.  At the time, nearly all use of computers required writing custom software, which was something only scientists and mathematicians tended to learn.  Versions of BASIC became widespread on microcomputers in the mid-1970s and 1980s. 

List of Byzantine emperors<====>4016<====>List of Byzantine emperorsThis is a list of the Byzantine emperors from the foundation of Constantinople in 330 AD, which marks the conventional start of the Byzantine Empire (or the Eastern Roman Empire), to its fall to the Ottoman Empire in 1453 AD.  Only the emperors who were recognized as legitimate rulers and exercised sovereign authority are included, to the exclusion of junior co-emperors (symbasileis) who never attained the status of sole or senior ruler, as well as of the various usurpers or rebels who claimed the imperial title. Traditionally, the line of Byzantine emperors is held to begin with the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, who rebuilt the city of Byzantium as an imperial capital, Constantinople, and who was regarded by the later emperors as the model ruler. 

Butterfly effect<====>4024<====>Butterfly effect The butterfly effect is a concept that states that "small causes can have larger effects". This concept was initially used in theories about weather prediction but later the term became a popular metaphor in science writing.    In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state.    The term itself was coined by Edward Lorenz, and is derived from the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado (exact time of formation, exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as the flapping of the wings of a distant butterfly several weeks earlier. 

Borland<====>4027<====>Borland   Borland Software Corporation is a software company that facilitates software deployment projects.  Borland was first headquartered in Scotts Valley, California, then in Cupertino, California, and now in Austin, Texas.It is now a Micro Focus International subsidiary.  It was founded in 1983 by Niels Jensen, Ole Henriksen, Mogens Glad and Philippe Kahn. History  The 1980s: FoundationsThree Danish citizens, Niels Jensen, Ole Henriksen, and Mogens Glad, founded Borland Ltd.  in August 1981 to develop products like Word Index for the CP/M operating system using an off-the-shelf company.

Buckminster Fuller<====>4031<====>Buckminster Fuller   Richard Buckminster "Bucky" Fuller ( ; July 12, 1895 – July 1, 1983)  was an American architect, systems theorist, author, designer, and inventor. Fuller published more than 30 books, coining or popularizing terms such as "Spaceship Earth", ephemeralization, and synergetic.  He also developed numerous inventions, mainly architectural designs, and popularized the widely known geodesic dome.  Carbon molecules known as fullerenes were later named by scientists for their structural and mathematical resemblance to geodesic spheres. Fuller was the second World President of Mensa from 1974 to 1983.   BiographyFuller was born on July 12, 1895, in Milton, Massachusetts, the son of Richard Buckminster Fuller and Caroline Wolcott Andrews, and grand-nephew of the American Transcendentalist Margaret Fuller. 

Bill Watterson<====>4032<====>Bill Watterson  William Boyd "Bill" Watterson II (born July 5, 1958) is an American cartoonist and the author of the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, which was syndicated from 1985 to 1995.  Watterson stopped drawing Calvin and Hobbes at the end of 1995 with a short statement to newspaper editors and his readers that he felt he had achieved all he could in the medium.  Watterson is known for his negative views on licensing and comic syndication, his efforts to expand and elevate the newspaper comic as an art-form, and his move back into private life after he stopped drawing Calvin and Hobbes. 

Black<====>4035<====>Black    Black is the darkest color, the result of the absence or complete absorption of visible light.  It is an achromatic color, literally a color without hue, like white (its opposite) and gray.    It is often used symbolically or figuratively to represent darkness, while white represents light.  Black ink is the most common color used for printing books, newspapers and documents, because it has the highest contrast with white paper and is the easiest to read.  For the same reason, black text on a white screen  is the most common format used on computer screens. 

Bletchley Park<====>4037<====>Bletchley Park   Bletchley Park was the central site for British (and subsequently, Allied) codebreakers during World War II.  It housed the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), which regularly penetrated the secret communications of the Axis Powers most importantly the German Enigma and Lorenz ciphers.  According to the official historian of British Intelligence, the "Ultra" intelligence produced at Bletchley shortened the war by two to four years, and that without it the outcome of the war would have been uncertain.    Located in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, Bletchley Park is open to the public, and receives hundreds of thousands of visitors annually. 

Bede<====>4041<====>Bede    Bede (   ;  ; 672/3 – 26 May 735), also known as Saint Bede, Venerable Bede, and Bede the Venerable ( ), was an English monk at the monastery of St.  Peter and its companion monastery of St.  Paul in the Kingdom of Northumbria of the Angles (contemporarily Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey in Tyne and Wear, England).  Born on lands likely belonging to the Monkwearmouth monastery, Bede was sent there at age seven and later joined Abbot Ceolfrith at the Jarrow monastery, both of whom survived a plague that struck in 686, an outbreak that killed a majority of the population there. 

Bubble tea<====>4045<====>Bubble tea Bubble tea (also known as pearl milk tea, bubble milk tea, boba juice, boba tea, or simply boba) ( , with tapioca balls it is  ) is a Taiwanese tea-based drink invented in Tainan and Taichung in the 1980s.Most bubble tea recipes contain a tea base mixed with fruit or milk, to which chewy tapioca balls (known as bubbles, pearls, or boba) and fruit jelly (especially tropical fruits like lychee) are often added.  Ice-blended versions are usually mixed with fruit or syrup, resulting in a slushy consistency.There are many varieties of the drink with a wide range of ingredients. 

Battle of Blenheim<====>4049<====>Battle of Blenheim    The Battle of Blenheim (German:Zweite Schlacht bei Höchstädt; French Bataille de Höchstädt), fought on 13 August 1704, was a major battle of the War of the Spanish Succession.   The overwhelming Allied victory ensured the safety of Vienna from the Franco-Bavarian army, thus preventing the collapse of the Grand Alliance. Louis XIV of France sought to knock Emperor Leopold out of the war by seizing Vienna, the Habsburg capital, and gain a favourable peace settlement.  The dangers to Vienna were considerable: the Elector of Bavaria and Marshal Marsin's forces in Bavaria threatened from the west, and Marshal Vendôme's large army in northern Italy posed a serious danger with a potential offensive through the Brenner Pass. 

Battle of Ramillies<====>4050<====>Battle of Ramillies    The Battle of Ramillies ( ), fought on 23 May 1706, was a battle of the War of the Spanish Succession.  For the Grand Alliance – Austria, England, and the Dutch Republic – the battle had followed an indecisive campaign against the Bourbon armies of King Louis XIV of France in 1705.  Although the Allies had captured Barcelona that year, they had been forced to abandon their campaign on the Moselle, had stalled in the Spanish Netherlands and suffered defeat in northern Italy.  Yet despite his opponents' setbacks Louis XIV wanted peace, but on reasonable terms. 

Brian Kernighan<====>4051<====>Brian Kernighan   Brian Wilson Kernighan ( ; born January 1, 1942)  is a Canadian computer scientist who worked at Bell Labs alongside Unix creators Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie and contributed to the development of Unix.  He is also coauthor of the AWK and AMPL programming languages.  The "K" of K&R C and the "K" in AWK both stand for "Kernighan".  Since 2000 Brian Kernighan has been a Professor at the Computer Science Department of Princeton University, where he is also the Undergraduate Department Representative.Early life and educationBorn in Toronto, Kernighan attended the University of Toronto between 1960 and 1964, earning his Bachelor's degree in engineering physics. 

BCPL<====>4052<====>BCPL   BCPL ("Basic Combined Programming Language"; or 'Before C Programming Language' (a common humorous backronym)   ) is a procedural, imperative, and structured computer programming language.   Originally intended for writing compilers for other languages, BCPL is no longer in common use.  However, its influence is still felt because a stripped down and syntactically changed version of BCPL, called B, was the language on which the C programming language was based.   BCPL introduced several features of modern programming languages, including using curly braces to delimit code blocks; compilation via virtual machine byte code; and the world's first 'hello world' demonstrator program. 

Battleship<====>4054<====>Battleship   A battleship is a large armored warship with a main battery consisting of large caliber guns.  During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the battleship was the most powerful type of warship, and a fleet of battleships was considered vital for any nation that desired to maintain command of the sea. The word battleship was coined around 1794 and is a contraction of the phrase line-of-battle ship, the dominant wooden warship during the Age of Sail.  "battleship" The Oxford English Dictionary.  2nd ed.  1989.  OED Online.  Oxford University Press.  April 4, 2000. 

Bifröst<====>4055<====>Bifröst In Norse mythology, Bifröst (   or sometimes Bilröst or Bivrost) is a burning rainbow bridge that reaches between Midgard (Earth) and Asgard, the realm of the gods.  The bridge is attested as Bilröst in the Poetic Edda; compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and as Bifröst in the Prose Edda; written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in the poetry of skalds.  Both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda alternately refer to the bridge as Ásbrú (Old Norse "Æsir's bridge").  Simek (2007:19).  According to the Prose Edda, the bridge ends in heaven at Himinbjörg, the residence of the god Heimdallr, who guards it from the jötnar. 

Battlecruiser<====>4057<====>Battlecruiser The battlecruiser, or battle cruiser, was a type of capital ship of the first half of the 20th century.  They were similar in size, cost, and armament to battleships, but they generally carried less armour in order to obtain faster speeds.  The first battlecruisers were designed in the United Kingdom in the first decade of the century, as a development of the armoured cruiser, at the same time as the dreadnought succeeded the pre-dreadnought battleship.  The goal of the design was to outrun any ship with similar armament, and chase down any ship with lesser armament; they were intended to hunt down slower, older armoured cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire while avoiding combat with the more powerful but slower battleships. 

Bob Hawke<====>4059<====>Bob Hawke   Robert James Lee Hawke   (born 9 December 1929)  is a former Australian politician who was the 23rd Prime Minister of Australia, serving from 1983 to 1991.  He held office as the leader of the Labor Party. Hawke was born in South Australia but moved to Western Australia as a child.  He attended the University of Western Australia and then went on to Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar.  In 1956, Hawke joined the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) as a research officer.  Having risen to become responsible for wage arbitration, he was elected President of the ACTU in 1969, where he achieved an unprecedented level of popularity. 

Baldr<====>4060<====>Baldr Baldr (also Balder, Baldur) is a Æsir god of light, joy, purity, and the summer sun in Norse mythology, and a son of the god Odin and the goddess Frigg.  He is the father of Forseti, and He has numerous brothers, such as Thor and Váli. In the 12th century, Danish accounts by Saxo Grammaticus and other Danish Latin chroniclers recorded a euhemerized account of his story.  Compiled in Iceland in the 13th century, but based on much older Old Norse poetry, the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda contain numerous references to the death of Baldr as both a great tragedy to the Æsir and a harbinger of Ragnarök. 

Breidablik<====>4061<====>BreidablikIn Norse mythology, Breiðablik  (Broad-gleaming) is the home of Baldr.  It is briefly described in Snorri Sturluson's Gylfaginning as one of the halls of Asgard:"Then there is also in that place the abode called Breidablik, and there is not in heaven a fairer dwelling. " Later in the work, when Snorri describes Baldr, he gives a longer description, citing Grímnismál, though he does not name the poem:"He dwells in the place called Breidablik, which is in heaven; in that place may nothing unclean be, even as is said here:Breidablik 't is called, | where Baldr hasA hall made for himself:In that land | where I know lieFewest baneful runes. 

Bilskirnir<====>4062<====>BilskirnirBilskirnir (Old Norse "lightning-crack" Orchard (1997:20).  ) is the hall of the god Thor in Norse mythology.  Here he lives with his wife Sif and their children.  According to Grímnismál, the hall is the greatest of buildings and contains 540 rooms, located in Asgard, as are all the dwellings of the gods, in the kingdom of Þrúðheimr (or Þrúðvangar according to Gylfaginning and Ynglinga saga). Modern influenceThe hall inspired the name of an Asgard starship commanded by Supreme Commander Thor, in the television series Stargate SG-1 named Beliskner. There is a NS / pagan black metal  band from Hesse, Germany named Bilskirnir. 

Brísingamen<====>4063<====>BrísingamenIn Norse mythology, Brísingamen (or Brísinga men) is the torc or necklace of the goddess Freyja.   The name is an Old Norse compound brísinga-men whose second element is men "(ornamental) neck-ring (of precious metal), torc".   The etymology of the first element is uncertain.  It has been derived from Old Norse brísingr, a poetic term for "fire" or "amber" mentioned in the anonymous versified word-lists (þulur) appended to many manuscripts of the Prose Edda,  making Brísingamen "gleaming torc", "sunny torc", or the like.  However, Brísingr can also be an ethnonym, in which case Brísinga men is "torque of the Brísings"; the Old English parallel in Beowulf supports this derivation, though who the Brísings (Old Norse Brísingar) may have been remains unknown. 

Borsuk–Ulam theorem<====>4064<====>Borsuk–Ulam theoremIn mathematics, the Borsuk–Ulam theorem (BUT) states that every continuous function from an n-sphere into Euclidean n-space maps some pair of antipodal points to the same point.  Here, two points on a sphere are called antipodal if they are in exactly opposite directions from the sphere's center. Formally: if  f: S^n \to \mathbb{R}^n  is continuous then there exists an  x\in S^n  such that:   f(-x)=f(x) . The case  n=1  can be illustrated by saying that there always exist a pair of opposite points on the Earth's equator with the same temperature. 

Bragi<====>4067<====>Bragi Bragi is the skaldic god of poetry in Norse mythology. EtymologyBragi is generally associated with bragr, the Norse word for poetry.   The name of the god may have been derived from bragr, or the term bragr may have been formed to describe 'what Bragi does'.  A connection between the name Bragi and Old English brego 'chieftain' has been suggested but is generally now discounted.  A connection between Bragi and the bragarfull 'promise cup' is sometimes suggested, as  bragafull, an alternate form of the word, might be translated as 'Bragi's cup'.  See Bragarfull. AttestationsSnorri Sturluson writes in the Gylfaginning after describing Odin, Thor, and Baldr: In Skáldskaparmál Snorri writes: That Bragi is Odin's son is clearly mentioned only here and in some versions of a list of the sons of Odin (see Sons of Odin). 

Blaise Pascal<====>4068<====>Blaise Pascal    Blaise Pascal ( ;   ; 19 June 1623 – 19 August 1662) was a French mathematician, physicist, inventor, writer and Catholic theologian.  He was a child prodigy who was educated by his father, a tax collector in Rouen.   Pascal's earliest work was in the natural and applied sciences where he made important contributions to the study of fluids, and clarified the concepts of pressure and vacuum by generalising the work of Evangelista Torricelli.  Pascal also wrote in defence of the scientific method. In 1642, while still a teenager, he started some pioneering work on calculating machines. 

Brittonic languages<====>4069<====>Brittonic languages  The Brittonic, Brythonic or British Celtic languages ( ,  ,  ) form one of the two branches of the Insular Celtic language family; the other is Goidelic.   The name Brythonic was derived by Welsh Celticist John Rhys from the Welsh word  , meaning an indigenous Briton as opposed to an Anglo-Saxon or Gael.  The name Brittonic derives ultimately from the name   ( ), recorded  by Greek authors for the British Isles.  Some authors reserve the term Brittonic for the modified later Brittonic languages after about AD 600. 

Bronski Beat<====>4071<====>Bronski BeatBronski Beat were a popular British synthpop trio which achieved success in the mid-1980s, particularly with the 1984 chart hit "Smalltown Boy".  All members of the group were openly gay and their songs reflected this, often containing political commentary on gay-related issues.   The initial line-up, which recorded the majority of the band's hits, consisted of Jimmy Somerville (vocals), Steve Bronski (keyboards, percussion) and Larry Steinbachek (keyboards, percussion).   Somerville left Bronski Beat in 1985, and went on to have success as lead singer of The Communards and as a solo artist. 

Binary prefix<====>4077<====>Binary prefix  A binary prefix is a unit prefix for multiples of units in data processing, data transmission, and digital information, notably the bit and the byte, to indicate multiplication by a power of 2. The computer industry has historically used the units kilobyte, megabyte, and gigabyte, and the corresponding symbols KB, MB, and GB, in at least two slightly different measurement systems.  In citations of main memory (RAM) capacity, gigabyte customarily means   bytes.  As this is a power of 1024, and 1024 is a power of two (2 10 ), this usage is referred to as a binary measurement. 

National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum<====>4078<====>National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum    The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is an American history museum and hall of fame, located in Cooperstown, New York, and operated by private interests.  It serves as the central point for the study of the history of baseball in the United States and beyond, displays baseball-related artifacts and exhibits, and honors those who have excelled in playing, managing, and serving the sport.  The Hall's motto is "Preserving History, Honoring Excellence, Connecting Generations. "The word Cooperstown is often used as shorthand (or a metonym) for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. 

BPP (complexity)<====>4079<====>BPP (complexity) In computational complexity theory, BPP, which stands for bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time is the class of decision problems solvable by a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time with an error probability bounded away from 1/2 for all instances. BPP is one of the largest practical classes of problems, meaning most problems of interest in BPP have efficient probabilistic algorithms that can be run quickly on real modern machines.   BPP also contains P, the class of problems solvable in polynomial time with a deterministic machine, since a deterministic machine is a special case of a probabilistic machine. 

BQP<====>4080<====>BQP  In computational complexity theory, BQP (bounded-error quantum polynomial time) is the class of decision problems solvable by a quantum computer in polynomial time, with an error probability of at most 1/3 for all instances.  It is the quantum analogue of the complexity class BPP. A decision problem is a member of  BQP if there exists an algorithm for a quantum computer (a quantum algorithm) that solves the decision problem with high probability and is guaranteed to run in polynomial time.  A run of the algorithm will correctly solve the decision problem with  a probability of at least 2/3. 

Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night<====>4081<====>Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night  Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night is a science fiction novel by American writer K.  W.  Jeter published in 1996.  It is a continuation of Jeter's novel Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human, which was itself a sequel to both the film Blade Runner and the novel upon which the film was based, Philip K.  Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?Plot introductionLiving on Mars, Deckard is acting as a consultant to a movie crew filming the story of his days as a blade runner.  He finds himself drawn into a mission on behalf of the replicants he was once assigned to kill. 

Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human<====>4082<====>Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human   Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human (1995) is a science fiction novel by American writer K.  W.  Jeter.  It is a continuation of both the film Blade Runner and the novel upon which the film was based, Philip K.  Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?PlotSeveral months after the events depicted in Blade Runner, Deckard has retired to an isolated shack outside the city, taking the replicant Rachael with him in a Tyrell transport container, which slows down the replicant aging process.  He is approached by a woman who explains she is Sarah Tyrell, niece of Eldon Tyrell, heiress to the Tyrell Corporation and the human template ("templant") for the Rachael replicant. 

Brainfuck<====>4086<====>Brainfuck   Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban Müller, and notable for its extreme minimalism. The language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer.   While it is fully Turing-complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers.  Brainfuck simply requires one to break commands into microscopic steps. The language's name is a reference to the slang term brainfuck, which refers to things so complicated or unusual that they exceed the limits of one's understanding.  HistoryIn 1992, Urban Müller, a Swiss physics student, took over a small online archive for Amiga software. 

Bartolomeo Ammannati<====>4091<====>Bartolomeo Ammannati Bartolomeo Ammannati (18 June 1511 13 April 1592) was an Italian architect and sculptor, born at Settignano, near Florence.  He studied under Baccio Bandinelli and Jacopo Sansovino (assisting on the design of the Library of St.  Mark's, the Biblioteca Marciana, Venice) and closely imitated the style of Michelangelo.  He was more distinguished in architecture than in sculpture.  He worked in Rome in collaboration with Vignola and Vasari),  including designs for the Villa Giulia, but also for works and at Lucca.   He labored during 1558–1570, in the refurbishment and enlargement of Pitti Palace, creating the courtyard consisting of three wings with rusticated facades, and one lower portico leading to the amphitheatre in the Boboli Gardens. 

Bishop<====>4092<====>Bishop   A bishop (English derivationfrom the New Testament of the Christian Bible Greek  , epískopos, "overseer", "guardian") is an ordained, consecrated, or appointed member of the Christian clergy who is generally entrusted with a position of authority and oversight. Within the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Anglican, Old Catholic and Independent Catholic churches and in the Assyrian Church of the East, bishops claim apostolic succession, a direct historical lineage dating back to the original Twelve Apostles.  Within these churches, bishops are seen as those who possess the full priesthood and can ordain clergy – including another bishop. 

Bertrand Andrieu<====>4093<====>Bertrand AndrieuBertrand Andrieu (24 November 1761 – 6 December 1822) was a French engraver of medals.  He was born in Bordeaux. In France, he was considered as the restorer of the art, which had declined after the time of Louis XIV. During the last twenty years of his life, the French government commissioned him to undertake every major work of importance.

Bordeaux<====>4097<====>Bordeaux    Bordeaux ( ; Gascon Occitan:  ) is a port city on the Garonne River in the Gironde department in southwestern France. The municipality (commune) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 246,586 (2014).  Together with its suburbs and satellite towns, Bordeaux is the centre of the Bordeaux Métropole.  With 760,933 inhabitants ( ) and 1,195,335 in the metropolitan area, it is the sixth largest in France, after Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse and Lille.  It is the capital of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, as well as the prefecture of the Gironde department.  Its inhabitants are called "Bordelais" (for men) or "Bordelaises" (women). 

Puzzle Bobble<====>4098<====>Puzzle Bobble    , also known as Bust-a-Move in North America, is a 1994 tile-matching arcade puzzle video game for one or two players created by Taito Corporation.  It is based on Taito's popular 1986 arcade game Bubble Bobble, featuring characters and themes from that game.  Its characteristically cute Japanese animation and music, along with its play mechanics and level designs, made it successful as an arcade title and spawned several sequels and ports to home gaming systems. The characters and theme of the game are based on the 1986 arcade game Bubble Bobble.  An arrangement of the original Bubble Bobble background music is played in the game's end credits. 

Bone<====>4099<====>Bone    A bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the vertebrate skeleton.  Bones support and protect the various organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells, store minerals, provide structure and support for the body, and enable mobility.  Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have a complex internal and external structure.  They are lightweight yet strong and hard, and serve multiple functions. Bone tissue (osseous tissue) is a hard tissue, a type of dense connective tissue.   It has a honeycomb-like matrix internally, which helps to give the bone rigidity. 

Bretwalda<====>4100<====>Bretwalda  Bretwalda (also brytenwalda and bretenanwealda, sometimes capitalised) is an Old English word.  The first record comes from the late 9th-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.  It is given to some of the rulers of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms from the 5th century onwards who had achieved overlordship of some or all of the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.  It is unclear whether the word dates back to the 5th century and was used by the kings themselves or whether it is a later, 9th-century, invention.  The term bretwalda also appears in a 10th-century charter of Æthelstan.  The literal meaning of the word is disputed and may translate to either 'wide-ruler' or 'Britain-ruler'. 

Brouwer fixed-point theorem<====>4101<====>Brouwer fixed-point theorem Brouwer's fixed-point theorem is a fixed-point theorem in topology, named after L.  E.  J.  (Bertus) Brouwer.  It states that for any continuous function  f  mapping a compact convex set to itself there is a point  x_0  such that  f(x_0)=x_0 .  The simplest forms of Brouwer's theorem are for continuous functions  f  from a closed interval  I  in the real numbers to itself or from a closed disk  D  to itself.  A more general form than the latter is for continuous functions from a convex compact subset  K  of Euclidean space to itself. 

Benzoic acid<====>4106<====>Benzoic acid Benzoic acid  , C 7 H 6 O 2  (or C 6 H 5 COOH), is a colorless crystalline solid and a simple aromatic carboxylic acid.  The name is derived from gum benzoin, which was for a long time its only known source.  Benzoic acid occurs naturally in many plants  and serves as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of many secondary metabolites.   Salts of benzoic acid are used as food preservatives and benzoic acid is an important precursor for the industrial synthesis of many other organic substances.   The salts and esters of benzoic acid are known as benzoates  . 

Boltzmann distribution<====>4107<====>Boltzmann distribution In statistical mechanics and mathematics, a Boltzmann distribution (also called Gibbs distribution   Translated by J. B.  Sykes and M. J.  Kearsley.  See section 28 ) is a probability distribution, probability measure, or frequency distribution of particles in a system over various possible states.  The distribution is expressed in the form  F({\rm state}) \propto e^{-\frac{E}{kT}}  where  E  is state energy (which varies from state to state), and  kT  (a constant of the distribution) is the product of Boltzmann's constant and thermodynamic temperature. In statistical mechanics, the Boltzmann distribution is a probability distribution that gives the probability that a system will be in a certain state as a function of that state’s energy and the temperature of the system. 

Leg theory<====>4109<====>Leg theory Leg theory is a bowling tactic in the sport of cricket.The term leg theory is somewhat archaic and seldom used any longer, but the basic tactic remains a play in modern cricket. Simply put, leg theory involves concentrating the bowling attack at or near the line of leg stump.  This may or may not be accompanied by a concentration of fielders on the leg side.  The line of attack aims to cramp the batsman, making him play the ball with the bat close to the body.  This makes it difficult to hit the ball freely and score runs, especially on the off side. 

Blythe Danner<====>4110<====>Blythe Danner  Blythe Katherine Danner (born February 3, 1943) is an American actress.  She won two Primetime Emmy Awards for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her role as Izzy Huffstodt on Huff (2004–2006), and a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play for her performance in Butterflies Are Free (1969–1972).  Danner was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for portraying Marilyn Truman on Will & Grace (2001–2006), and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie for her roles in We Were the Mulvaneys (2002) and Back When We Were Grownups (2004). 

Bioleaching<====>4111<====>BioleachingBioleaching is the extraction of metals from their ores through the use of living organisms.  This is much cleaner than the traditional heap leaching using cyanide.   Bioleaching is one of several applications within biohydrometallurgy and several methods are used to recover copper, zinc, lead, arsenic, antimony, nickel, molybdenum, gold, silver, and cobalt. ProcessBioleaching can involve numerous ferrous iron and sulfur oxidizing bacteria, including Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (formerly known as Thiobacillus ferrooxidans) and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans  (formerly known as Thiobacillus thiooxidans).  As a general principle, Fe 3+  ions are used to oxidize the ore.  This step is entirely independent of microbes. 

Bouldering<====>4113<====>Bouldering   Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls, known as boulders, without the use of ropes or harnesses.  While it can be done without any equipment, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry and provide a firmer grip, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls.  Unlike free solo climbing, which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (the path that a climber takes to complete the climb) are usually less than 6 meters (20 ft. ) tall. 

Boiling point<====>4115<====>Boiling point The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid   and the liquid changes into a vapor. The boiling point of a liquid varies depending upon the surrounding environmental pressure.   A liquid in a partial vacuum has a lower boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure.   A liquid at high pressure has a higher boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure.    For a given pressure, different liquids boil at different temperatures. 

Big Bang<====>4116<====>Big Bang The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model for the universe    from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution.The model describes how the universe expanded from a very high-density and high-temperature state,and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), large scale structure and Hubble's law.   If the known laws of physics are extrapolated to the highest density regime, the result is a singularity which is typically associated with the Big Bang. 

Bock<====>4119<====>Bock   Bock is a strong lager of German origin.  Several substyles exist, including maibock (helles bock, heller bock), a paler, more hopped version generally made for consumption at spring festivals; doppelbock (double bock), a stronger and maltier version; and eisbock, a much stronger version made by partially freezing the beer and removing the ice that forms. Originally a dark beer, a modern bock can range from light copper to brown in colour.The style is very popular, with many examples brewed internationally. HistoryThe style known now as bock was a dark, malty, lightly hopped ale first brewed in the 14th century by German brewers in the Hanseatic town of Einbeck. 

Bantu languages<====>4124<====>Bantu languages The Bantu languages ( ),  technically the Narrow Bantu languages as opposed to "Wide Bantu", a loosely defined categorization which includes other Bantoid languages, constitute a traditional branch of the Niger–Congo languages.  There are about 250 Bantu languages by the criterion of mutual intelligibility,  though the distinction between language and dialect is often unclear, and Ethnologue counts 535 languages.    Bantu languages are spoken largely east and south of present-day Cameroon, that is, in the regions commonly known as Central Africa, Southeast Africa, and Southern Africa.  Parts of the Bantu area include languages from other language families (see map). 

CIM-10 Bomarc<====>4130<====>CIM-10 Bomarc   The Boeing CIM-10 Bomarc (IM-99 Weapon System  prior to September 1962)  was a supersonic long-range surface-to-air missile (SAM) used during the Cold War for the air defense of North America.  In addition to being the first operational long-range SAM, it was the only SAM deployed by the United States Air Force. Stored horizontally in a launcher shelter with movable roof, the missile was erected, fired vertically using rocket boosters to high altitude, and then tipped over into a horizontal Mach 2. 5 cruise powered by ramjet engines.  This lofted trajectory allowed the missile to operate at a maximum range as great as  . 

Branco River<====>4132<====>Branco River  The Branco River ( ; Engl: White River) is the principal affluent of the Rio Negro from the north.  BasinThe river drains the Guayanan Highlands moist forests ecoregion.  It is enriched by many streams from the Tepui highlands which separate Venezuela and Guyana from Brazil.  Its two upper main tributaries are the Uraricoera and the Takutu.The latter almost links its sources with those of the Essequibo; during floods headwaters of the Branco and those of the Essequibo are connected, allowing a level of exchange in the aquatic fauna (such as fish) between the two systems. 

Bus<====>4146<====>Bus   A bus (archaically also omnibus, multibus, motorbus, autobus) is a road vehicle designed to carry many passengers.  Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers.The most common type of bus is the single-decker rigid bus, with larger loads carried by double-decker and articulated buses, and smaller loads carried by midibuses and minibuses; coaches are used for longer-distance services.  Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare.  Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus do not charge a fare. 

Bali<====>4147<====>Bali Bali (Balinese:  , Indonesian: Pulau Bali, Provinsi Bali) is an island and province of Indonesia.  The province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller neighbouring islands, notably Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Ceningan.  It is located at the westernmost end of the Lesser Sunda Islands, with Java to the west and Lombok to the east.  Its capital, Denpasar, is located in the southern part of the island. With a population of 3,890,757 in the 2010 census,  and 4,225,000 as of January 2014,  the island is home to most of Indonesia's Hindu minority. 

Bulgarian language<====>4149<====>Bulgarian language   Bulgarian  ,   (  bǎlgarski,  ) is an Indo-European language, a member of the Southern branch of the Slavic language family. Bulgarian, along with the closely related Macedonian language (collectively forming the East South Slavic languages), has several characteristics that set it apart from all other Slavic languages: changes include the elimination of case declension, the development of a suffixed definite article (see Balkan language area), and the lack of a verb infinitive, but it retains and has further developed the Proto-Slavic verb system.  Various evidential verb forms exist to express unwitnessed, retold, and doubtful action.

An n-gonal bipyramid has 2n triangle faces, 3n edges, and 2 + n vertices. The referenced n-gon in the name of the bipyramids is not an external face but an internal one, existing on the primary symmetry plane which connects the two pyramid halves. 

Beast of Bodmin Moor<====>4154<====>Beast of Bodmin Moor The Beast of Bodmin Moor, also known as the Beast of Bodmin  ( ) is a phantom wild cat purported to live in Cornwall, England.   Bodmin Moor became a centre of purported sightings after 1978, with occasional reports of mutilated slain livestock; the alleged panther-like cats of the same region came to be popularly known as the Beast of Bodmin Moor. In general, scientists reject such claims because of the improbably large numbers necessary to maintain a breeding population and because climate and food supply issues would make such purported creatures' survival in reported habitats unlikely. 

Brown University<====>4157<====>Brown University  Brown University is a private Ivy League research university in Providence, Rhode Island, United States.  Founded in 1764 as the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Brown is the seventh-oldest institution  of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.  At its foundation, Brown was the first college in the United States to accept students regardless of their religious affiliation,  reflecting the religious liberty that Roger Williams established in what would become the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. 

Bill Atkinson<====>4158<====>Bill Atkinson Bill Atkinson (born 1951) is an American computer engineer and photographer.   Atkinson worked at Apple Computer from 1978 to 1990. Atkinson was the principal designer and developer of the graphical user interface (GUI) of the Apple Lisa and, later, one of the first thirty members of the original Apple Macintosh development team,  and was the creator of the ground-breaking MacPaint application, which fulfilled the vision of using the computer as a creative tool.  He also designed and implemented QuickDraw, the fundamental toolbox that the Lisa and Macintosh used for graphics.  QuickDraw's performance was essential for the success of the Macintosh GUI. 

Battle of Lostwithiel<====>4160<====>Battle of Lostwithiel    The Battles of Lostwithiel or Lostwithiel Campaign, took place near Lostwithiel and Fowey in Cornwall during the First English Civil War in 1644.  They resulted in victory for the Royalists commanded by King Charles over the Parliamentarians commanded by the Earl of Essex. PreludeAfter defeating the army of Sir William Waller at the Battle of Cropredy Bridge, King Charles marched west in pursuit of the Parliamentarian army of the Earl of Essex, who was invading the Royalist stronghold of Cornwall. Essex had been misled into believing that he could expect substantial support from the people of Cornwall. 

Bertrand Russell<====>4163<====>Bertrand Russell  Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell, ( ; 18 May 1872 – 2 February 1970) was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, writer, social critic, political activist and Nobel laureate.   Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "Bertrand Russell", 1 May 2003  At various points in his life, Russell considered himself a liberal, a socialist and a pacifist, but he also admitted that he had "never been any of these things, in any profound sense".   Russell was born in Monmouthshire into one of the most prominent aristocratic families in the United Kingdom. 

Boeing 767<====>4165<====>Boeing 767 The Boeing 767 is a mid- to large-size, mid- to long-range, wide-body twin-engine jet airliner built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes.  It was Boeing's first wide-body twinjet and its first airliner with a two-crew glass cockpit.  The aircraft has two turbofan engines, a conventional tail, and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design.  Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner than earlier aircraft such as the 747, the 767 has seating capacity for 181 to 375 people, and a design range of  , depending on variant.  Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with a narrow-body twinjet, the 757, resulting in shared design features which allow pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate both aircraft. 

Bill Walsh (American football coach)<====>4166<====>Bill Walsh (American football coach) William Ernest Walsh (November 30, 1931 – July 30, 2007) was an American football coach.  He served as head coach of the San Francisco 49ers and the Stanford Cardinal football team, during which time he popularized the West Coast offense.  After retiring from the 49ers, Walsh worked as a sports broadcaster for several years and then returned as head coach at Stanford for three seasons. Walsh went 102–63–1 with the 49ers, winning 10 of his 14 postseason games along with six division titles, three NFC Championship titles, and three Super Bowls.  He was named NFL Coach of the Year in 1981 and 1984. 

Utility knife<====>4168<====>Utility knife  A utility knife is a knife used for general or utility purposes.  Peterson, Harold L. , Daggers and Fighting Knives of the Western World, London: Herbert Jenkins Ltd. ,  , p.  1   The utility knife was originally a fixed blade knife with a cutting edge suitable for general work such as cutting hides and cordage, scraping hides, butchering animals, cleaning fish, and other tasks.  Craft knives are tools mostly used for crafts.   Today, the term "utility knife" also includes small folding or retractable-blade knives suited for use in the general workplace or in the construction industry. 

Bronze<====>4169<====>Bronze Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper, commonly with about 12% tin and often with the addition of other metals (such as aluminium, manganese, nickel or zinc) and sometimes non-metals or metalloids such as arsenic, phosphorus or silicon.  These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone, or have other useful properties, such as stiffness, ductility, or machinability. The archeological period where bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the Bronze Age.   In the ancient Near East this began with the rise of Sumer in the 4th millennium BC, with India and China starting to use bronze around the same time; everywhere it gradually spread across regions. 

Benelux<====>4170<====>Benelux   The Benelux Union ( ;   )  is a politico-economic union of three neighbouring states in western Europe: Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.  The name Benelux is formed from joining the first two or three letters of each country's name – Belgium Netherlands Luxembourg – and was first used to name the customs agreement that initiated the union (signed in 1944).   It is now used more generally to refer to the geographic, economic and cultural grouping of the three countries. In 1951, these countries joined West Germany, France, and Italy to form the European Coal and Steel Community, a predecessor of the European Economic Community (EEC) and today's European Union (EU). 

Boston Herald<====>4171<====>Boston Herald   The Boston Herald is an American daily newspaper whose primary market is Boston, Massachusetts and its surrounding area.  It was founded in 1846 and is one of the oldest daily newspapers in the United States.  It has been awarded eight Pulitzer Prizes in its history, including four for editorial writing and three for photography before it was converted to tabloid format in 1981.  The Herald was named one of the "10 Newspapers That 'Do It Right'  in 2012 by Editor & Publisher.  In December 2017, the Herald filed for bankruptcy; as of January 2018 there are multiple bidders, which will require the paper to be sold at auction, per the bankruptcy court. 

Babe Ruth<====>4173<====>Babe RuthGeorge Herman "Babe" Ruth Jr.  (February 6, 1895 – August 16, 1948) was an American professional baseball player whose career in Major League Baseball (MLB) spanned 22 seasons, from 1914 through 1935.  Nicknamed "The Bambino" and "The Sultan of Swat", he began his MLB career as a stellar left-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging outfielder for the New York Yankees.  Ruth established many MLB batting (and some pitching) records, including career home runs (714), runs batted in (RBIs) (2,213), bases on balls (2,062), slugging percentage (. 

Barge<====>4177<====>Barge   A barge is a flat-bottomed boat, built mainly for river and canal transport of heavy goods.  Some barges are not self-propelled and must be towed or pushed by towboats, canal barges or towed by draft animals on an adjacent towpath.  Barges contended with the railway in the early Industrial Revolution, but were outcompeted in the carriage of high-value items due to the higher speed, falling costs and route flexibility of railways. EtymologyBarge is attested from 1300, from Old French barge, from Vulgar Latin barga.  The word originally could refer to any small boat; the modern meaning arose around 1480. 

Bill Schelter<====>4178<====>Bill Schelter  William Frederick Schelter (1947  – July 30, 2001) was a professor of mathematics at The University of Texas at Austin and a Lisp developer and programmer.   Schelter is credited with the development of the GNU Common Lisp (GCL) implementation of Common Lisp and the GPL'd version of the computer algebra system Macsyma called Maxima.  Schelter authored Austin Kyoto Common Lisp (AKCL) under contract with IBM.  AKCL formed the foundation for Axiom, another computer algebra system.  AKCL eventually became GNU Common Lisp.  He is also credited with the first port of the GNU C compiler to the Intel 386 architecture, used in the original implementation of the Linux kernel. 

British English<====>4179<====>British English   British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom.   Variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom.  For example, the adjective wee is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas little is predominant elsewhere.  Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in written English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term British English.  The forms of spoken English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken,  so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. 

Battle<====>4181<====>Battle A battle is a combat in warfare between two or more armed forces, or combatants.  A war sometimes consists of many battles.  Battles generally are well defined in duration, area, and force commitment.   A battle with only limited engagement between the forces and without decisive results is sometimes called a skirmish. Wars and military campaigns are guided by strategy, whereas battles take place on a level of planning and execution known as operational mobility.   German strategist Carl von Clausewitz stated that "the employment of battles . . .  to achieve the object of war"  was the essence of strategy. 

Berry Berenson<====>4182<====>Berry Berenson Berinthia "Berry" Berenson-Perkins (April 14, 1948 – September 11, 2001) was an American photographer, actress, and model.  Perkins, who was the widow of actor Anthony Perkins, died in the September 11 attacks as a passenger on American Airlines Flight 11. Early lifeBerenson was born in Murray Hill, Manhattan.  Her father, Robert Lawrence Berenson, was an American career diplomat turned shipping executive; he was of Lithuanian Jewish descent, and his family's original surname was Valvrojenski.Her mother was born  Maria-Luisa Yvonne Radha de Wendt de Kerlor, better known as Gogo Schiaparelli, a socialite of Italian, Swiss, French, and Egyptian ancestry. 

Botany<====>4183<====>Botany   Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology.  A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field.  The term "botany" comes from the Ancient Greek word   (botanē) meaning "pasture", "grass", or "fodder";   is in turn derived from   (boskein), "to feed" or "to graze". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. 

Bacillus thuringiensis<====>4184<====>Bacillus thuringiensis Bacillus thuringiensis (or Bt) is a Gram-positive, soil-dwelling bacterium, commonly used as a biological pesticide.  B.  thuringiensis also occurs naturally in the gut of caterpillars of various types of moths and butterflies, as well on leaf surfaces, aquatic environments, animal feces, insect-rich environments, and flour mills and grain-storage facilities.  It has also been observed to parasitize other moths such as Cadra calidella—in laboratory experiments working with C.  calidella, many of the moths were diseased due to this parasite.  During sporulation, many Bt strains produce crystal proteins (proteinaceous inclusions), called δ-endotoxins, that have insecticidal action. 

Bacteriophage<====>4185<====>Bacteriophage  A bacteriophage ( ), also known informally as a phage ( ), is a virus that infects and replicates within a bacterium.   The term was derived from "bacteria" and the   (phagein), "to devour".  Bacteriophages are composed of proteins that encapsulate a DNA or RNA genome, and may have relatively simple or elaborate structures.  Their genomes may encode as few as four genes, and as many as hundreds of genes.  Phages replicate within the bacterium following the injection of their genome into its cytoplasm.  Bacteriophages are among the most common and diverse entities in the biosphere. 

Bactericide<====>4187<====>Bactericide A bactericide or bacteriocide, sometimes abbreviated Bcidal, is a substance that kills bacteria. Bactericides are disinfectants, antiseptics, or antibiotics. DisinfectantsThe most used  disinfectants are those applyingactive chlorine (i.e., hypochlorites, chloramines, dichloroisocyanurate and trichloroisocyanurate, wet chlorine, chlorine dioxide, etc.),active oxygen (peroxides, such as peracetic acid, potassium persulfate, sodium perborate, sodium percarbonate, and urea perhydrate),iodine (povidone-iodine, Lugol's solution, iodine tincture, iodinated nonionic surfactants),concentrated alcohols (mainly ethanol, 1-propanol, called also n-propanol and 2-propanol, called isopropanol and mixtures thereof; further, 2-phenoxyethanol and 1- and 2-phenoxypropanols are used),phenolic substances (such as phenol (also called "carbolic acid"), cresols such as thymol, halogenated (chlorinated, brominated) phenols, such as hexachlorophene, triclosan, trichlorophenol, tribromophenol, pentachlorophenol, salts and isomers  thereof),cationic surfactants, such as some quaternary ammonium cations (such as benzalkonium chloride, cetyl trimethylammonium bromide or chloride, didecyldimethylammonium chloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, benzethonium chloride) and others, non-quaternary compounds, such as chlorhexidine, glucoprotamine, octenidine dihydrochloride etc.),strong oxidizers, such as ozone and permanganate solutions;heavy metals and their salts, such as colloidal silver, silver nitrate, mercury chloride, phenylmercury salts, copper sulfate, copper oxide-chloride etc. Heavy metals and their salts are the most toxic and environment-hazardous bactericides and therefore their use is strongly discouraged or prohibitedstrong acids (phosphoric, nitric, sulfuric, amidosulfuric, toluenesulfonic acids), pH   13, particularly under elevated temperature (above 60 °C), kills bacteria.AntisepticsAs antiseptics (i.e., germicide agents that can be used on human or animal body, skin, mucoses, wounds and the like), few of the above-mentioned disinfectants can be used, under proper conditions (mainly concentration, pH, temperature and toxicity toward humans and animals). Among them, some important areproperly diluted chlorine preparations (f.e. Dakin's solution, 0.5% sodium or potassium hypochlorite solution, pH-adjusted to pH 7 – 8, or 0.5 – 1% solution of sodium benzenesulfochloramide (chloramine B)), someiodine preparations, such as iodopovidone in various galenics (ointment, solutions, wound plasters), in the past also Lugol's solution,peroxides such as urea perhydrate solutions and pH-buffered 0.1 – 0.25% peracetic acid solutions,alcohols with or without antiseptic additives, used mainly for skin antisepsis,weak organic acids such as sorbic acid, benzoic acid, lactic acid and salicylic acidsome phenolic compounds, such as hexachlorophene, triclosan and Dibromol, andcationic surfactants, such as 0.05 – 0.5% benzalkonium, 0.5 – 4% chlorhexidine, 0.1 – 2% octenidine solutions.Others are generally not applicable as safe antiseptics, either because of their corrosive or toxic nature.AntibioticsBactericidal antibiotics kill bacteria; bacteriostatic antibiotics slow their growth or reproduction.Bactericidal antibiotics that inhibit cell wall synthesis: the beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillin derivatives (penams), cephalosporins (cephems), monobactams, and carbapenems) and vancomycin.Also bactericidal are daptomycin, fluoroquinolones, metronidazole, nitrofurantoin, co-trimoxazole, telithromycin.Aminoglycosidic antibiotics  are usually considered bactericidal, although they may be bacteriostatic with some organismsThe distinction between bactericidal and bacteriostatic agents appears to be clear according to the basic/clinical definition, but this only applies under strict laboratory conditions and it is important to distinguish microbiological and clinical definitions.  The distinction is more arbitrary when agents are categorized in clinical situations. The supposed superiority of bactericidal agents over bacteriostatic agents is of little relevance when treating the vast majority of infections with gram-positive bacteria, particularly in patients with uncomplicated infections and noncompromised immune systems. Bacteriostatic agents have been effectively used for treatment that are considered to require bactericidal activity. Furthermore, some broad classes of antibacterial agents considered bacteriostatic can exhibit bactericidal activity against some bacteria on the basis of in vitro determination of MBC/MIC values. At high concentrations, bacteriostatic agents are often bactericidal against some susceptible organisms. The ultimate guide to treatment of any infection must be clinical outcome.References See alsoList of antibioticsMicrobicide 

Brion Gysin<====>4188<====>Brion Gysin Brion Gysin  (19 January 1916 – 13 July 1986) was a painter, writer, sound poet, and performance artist born in Taplow, Buckinghamshire.    He is best known for his discovery of the cut-up technique, used by his friend, the novelist William S.  Burroughs.  With the engineer Ian Sommerville he invented the Dreamachine, a flicker device designed as an art object to be viewed with the eyes closed.  It was in painting and drawing, however, that Gysin devoted his greatest efforts, creating calligraphic works inspired by the cursive Japanese "grass" script and Arabic script. 

BCG vaccine<====>4191<====>BCG vaccine  Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine is a vaccine primarily used against tuberculosis.   In countries where tuberculosis is common, one dose is recommended in healthy babies as close to the time of birth as possible.   Babies with HIV/AIDS should not be vaccinated.In areas where tuberculosis is not common, only children at high risk are typically immunized, while suspected cases of tuberculosis are individually tested for and treated.   Adults who do not have tuberculosis and have not been previously immunized but are frequently exposed to drug-resistant tuberculosis may be immunized as well.

Common buzzard<====>4193<====>Common buzzard The common buzzard (Buteo buteo) is a medium-to-large bird of prey whose range covers most of Europe and extends into Asia.  Over much of its range, it is resident year-round, but birds from the colder parts of the Northern Hemisphere typically migrate south (some well into the Southern Hemisphere) for the northern winter. SystematicsThe first formal description of the common buzzard was by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Falco buteo.   The genus Buteo was introduced by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1799 by tautonymy with the specific name of this species. 

Bohrium<====>4194<====>Bohrium    Bohrium is a synthetic chemical element with symbol Bh and atomic number 107.  It is named after Danish physicist Niels Bohr.  It is a synthetic element (an element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature) and radioactive; the most stable known isotope,  270 Bh, has a half-life of approximately 61 seconds, though the unconfirmed  278 Bh may have a longer half-life of about 690 seconds. In the periodic table of the elements, it is a d-block transactinide element.  It is a member of the 7th period and belongs to the group 7 elements as the fifth member of the 6d series of transition metals. 

Barbara Olson<====>4195<====>Barbara Olson Barbara Kay Olson (née Bracher; December 27, 1955   September 11, 2001) was an American lawyer and conservative television commentator who worked for CNN, Fox News Channel, and several other outlets.   She was a passenger on American Airlines Flight 77 en route to a taping of Bill Maher's television show Politically Incorrect when it was flown into the Pentagon in the September 11 attacks.   Her original plan had been to fly to California on September 10, but she delayed her departure until the next morning so that she could wake up with her husband on his birthday, September 11. 

Barnard's Star<====>4196<====>Barnard's Star    Barnard's Star   is a very-low-mass red dwarf about 6 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Ophiuchus.  It is the fourth-nearest known individual star to the Sun (after the three components of the Alpha Centauri system) and the closest star in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere.   Despite its proximity, with a dim apparent magnitude of +9. 5, the star is invisible to the unaided eye; it is much brighter in the infrared than in visible light. The star is named after the American astronomer E. 

Bayer designation<====>4199<====>Bayer designation A Bayer designation is a stellar designation in which a specific star is identified by a Greek letter, followed by the genitive form of its parent constellation's Latin name.  The original list of Bayer designations contained 1,564 stars. Most of the brighter stars were assigned their first systematic names by the German astronomer Johann Bayer in 1603, in his star atlas Uranometria.  Bayer assigned a lower-case Greek letter, such as alpha (α), beta (β), gamma (γ), etc. , to each star he catalogued, combined with the Latin name of the star’s parent constellation in genitive (possessive) form. 

Boötes<====>4200<====>Boötes  Boötes   is a constellation in the northern sky, located between 0° and +60° declination, and 13 and 16 hours of right ascension on the celestial sphere.  The name comes from the Greek Βοώτης, Boōtēs, meaning "herdsman" or "plowman" (literally, "ox-driver"; from βοῦς bous “cow”). One of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, Boötes is now one of the 88 modern constellations.  It contains the fourth-brightest star in the night sky, the orange giant star Arcturus.  Epsilon Bootis, or Izar, is a colourful multiple star popular with amateur astronomers.  Boötes is home to many other bright stars, including eight above the fourth magnitude and an additional 21 above the fifth magnitude, making a total of 29 stars easily visible to the naked eye. 

Bernardino Ochino<====>4203<====>Bernardino Ochino Bernardino Ochino (1487–1564) was an Italian, who was raised a Roman Catholic and later turned to Protestantism. BiographyBernardino Ochino was born in Siena, the son of the barber Domenico Ochino, and at the age of 7 or 8, in around 1504, was entrusted to the order of Franciscan Friars.  From 1510 he studied medicine at Perugia. Transfer to the CapuchinsAt the age of 38, Ochino transferred himself in 1534 to the newly founded Order of Friars Minor Capuchin.  By then he was the close friend of Juan de Valdés, Pietro Bembo, Vittoria Colonna, Pietro Martire, Carnesecchi. 

Bay of Quinte<====>4204<====>Bay of Quinte  The Bay of Quinte   is a long, narrow bay shaped like the letter "Z" on the northern shore of Lake Ontario in the province of Ontario, Canada.  It is just west of the head of the Saint Lawrence River that drains the Great Lakes into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.  It is located about 200 kilometres east of Toronto and 400 kilometres west of Montreal. The name "Quinte" is derived from "Kenté", which was the name of an early French Catholic mission located on the north shore of what is now Prince Edward County. 

Bassoon<====>4207<====>Bassoon The bassoon is a woodwind instrument in the double reed family that typically plays music written in the bass and tenor clefs, and occasionally the treble.  Appearing in its modern form in the 19th century, the bassoon figures prominently in orchestral, concert band, and chamber music literature.  The bassoon is a non-transposing instrument known for its distinctive tone colour, wide range, variety of character and agility.  Listeners often compare its warm, dark, reedy timbre to that of a male baritone voice.  Someone who plays the bassoon is called a bassoonist. 

Bipedalism<====>4210<====>Bipedalism Bipedalism is a form of terrestrial locomotion where an organism moves by means of its two rear limbs or legs.  An animal or machine that usually moves in a bipedal manner is known as a biped  , meaning "two feet" (from the Latin bis for "double" and pes for "foot").  Types of bipedal movement include walking, running, or hopping. Few modern species are habitual bipeds whose normal method of locomotion is two-legged.  Within mammals, habitual bipedalism has evolved multiple times, with the macropods, kangaroo rats and mice, springhare,  hopping mice, pangolins and homininan apes, as well as various other extinct groups evolving the trait independently. 

Bootstrapping<====>4211<====>Bootstrapping In general, bootstrapping usually refers to a self-starting process that is supposed to proceed without external input.   In computer technology the term (usually shortened to booting) usually refers to the process of loading the basic software into the memory of a computer after power-on or general reset, especially the operating system which will then take care of loading other software as needed. The term appears to have originated in the early 19 th -century United States (particularly in the phrase "pull oneself over a fence by one's bootstraps") to mean an absurdly impossible action, an adynaton.   EtymologyTall boots may have a tab, loop or handle at the top known as a bootstrap, allowing one to use fingers or a boot hook tool to help pulling the boots on. 

Baltic languages<====>4213<====>Baltic languages  The Baltic languages belong to the Balto-Slavic branch of the Indo-European language family.  Baltic languages are spoken by the Balts, mainly in areas extending east and southeast of the Baltic Sea in Northern Europe. Scholars usually regard them as a single language family divided into two groups: Western Baltic (containing only extinct languages) and Eastern Baltic (containing two living languages, Lithuanian and Latvian).  The range of the Eastern Baltic linguistic influence once possibly reached as far as the Ural Mountains, but this hypothesis has been questioned.    Old Prussian, a Western Baltic language that became extinct in the 18th century, ranks as the most archaic of the Baltic languages. 

Bioinformatics<====>4214<====>Bioinformatics    Bioinformatics   is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data.  As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines Computer Science, Biology, Mathematics, and Engineering to analyze and interpret biological data.  Bioinformatics has been used for in silico analyses of biological queries using mathematical and statistical techniques. Bioinformatics is both an umbrella term for the body of biological studies that use computer programming as part of their methodology, as well as a reference to specific analysis "pipelines" that are repeatedly used, particularly in the field of genomics.  Common uses of bioinformatics include the identification of candidate genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). 

Brian De Palma<====>4216<====>Brian De Palma  Brian Russell De Palma (born September 11, 1940) is an American film director and screenwriter.  He is considered part of the New Hollywood wave of filmmaking. In a career spanning over 50 years, he is best known for his suspense, psychological thriller, and crime films.  He directed successful and popular films such as the supernatural horror film Carrie, erotic crime thriller Dressed to Kill, the thriller Blow Out, crime dramas Scarface, The Untouchables and Carlito's Way, and the action spy film Mission: Impossible. Early lifeDe Palma, who is of Italian ancestry, is the youngest of three boys and was born in Newark, New Jersey to Vivienne (née Muti) and Anthony Federico De Palma, an orthopedic surgeon. 

North American B-25 Mitchell<====>4218<====>North American B-25 Mitchell  The North American B-25 Mitchell is an American twin-engine, medium bomber manufactured by North American Aviation (NAA). The design was named in honor of Major General William "Billy" Mitchell, a pioneer of U. S.  military aviation.   Used by many Allied air forces, the B-25 served in every theater of World War II and after the war ended many remained in service, operating across four decades.   Produced in numerous variants, nearly 10,000 Mitchells rolled from NAA factories.   These included a few limited models, such as the United States Marine Corps' PBJ-1 patrol bomber and the United States Army Air Forces' F-10 reconnaissance aircraft and AT-24 trainers. 

Bobby Charlton<====>4224<====>Bobby CharltonSir Robert Charlton CBE (born 11 October 1937) is an English former football player, regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of all time, and an essential member of the England team who won the World Cup in 1966, the year he also won the Ballon d'Or.  He played almost all of his club football at Manchester United, where he became renowned for his attacking instincts and passing abilities from midfield and his ferocious long-range shot.  He was also well known for his fitness and stamina.  He was cautioned only twice in his career; once against Argentina in the 1966 World Cup, and once in a league match against Chelsea. 

Barry Lyndon<====>4227<====>Barry Lyndon  Barry Lyndon is a 1975 British-American period drama film by Stanley Kubrick, based on the 1844 novel The Luck of Barry Lyndon by William  Thackeray.  It stars Ryan O'Neal, Marisa Berenson, Patrick Magee, Leonard Rossiter and Hardy Krüger.  The film recounts the early exploits and later unraveling of a fictional 18th-century Irish rogue and opportunist who marries a rich widow to climb the social ladder and assume her late husband's aristocratic position.  The wry and doleful unreliable narrator Michael Hordern occasionally voice-overs the story. The film's cinematography has been described as ground breaking. 

Cell (biology)<====>4230<====>Cell (biology)    The cell (from Latin cella, meaning "small room"   ) is the basic structural, functional, and biological unit of all known living organisms.  A cell is the smallest unit of life that can replicate independently, and cells are often called the "building blocks of life".  The study of cells is called cell biology. Cells consist of  cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane, which contains many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids.

Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)<====>4231<====>Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film) Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a 1992 American comedy horror film about a Valley girl cheerleader named Buffy who learns that it is her fate to hunt vampires.   The film starred Kristy Swanson, Donald Sutherland, Paul Reubens, Rutger Hauer, Luke Perry, and Hilary Swank.  It was a moderate success at the box office,  but received mixed reception from critics.   The film was taken in a different direction from the one its writer Joss Whedon intended, and five years later, he created the darker and acclaimed TV series of the same name. 

Barter<====>4232<====>Barter  Barter is a system of exchange where goods or services are directly exchanged for other goods or services without using a medium of exchange, such as money.    It is distinguishable from gift economies in many ways; one of them is that the reciprocal exchange is immediate and not delayed in time.  It is usually  , but may be multilateral (i. e. , mediated through a trade exchange) and, in most developed countries, usually only exists parallel to monetary systems to a very limited extent.  Barter, as a replacement for money as the method of exchange, is used in times of monetary crisis, such as when the currency may be either unstable (e. 

Berthe Morisot<====>4233<====>Berthe Morisot Berthe Marie Pauline Morisot ( ; January 14, 1841 – March 2, 1895) was a painter and a member of the circle of painters in Paris who became known as the Impressionists.  She was described by Gustave Geffroy in 1894 as one of "les trois grandes dames" of Impressionism alongside Marie Bracquemond and Mary Cassatt.  In 1864, she exhibited for the first time in the highly esteemed Salon de Paris.  Sponsored by the government, and judged by Academicians, the Salon was the official, annual exhibition of the Académie des beaux-arts in Paris.  Her work was selected for exhibition in six subsequent Salons  until, in 1874, she joined the "rejected" Impressionists in the first of their own exhibitions, which included Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet,  Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Alfred Sisley. 

Barnard College<====>4237<====>Barnard College  Barnard College is a private women's liberal arts college in New York City, New York, United States.  Founded in 1889, it is considered to be once of the oldest women's colleges in the world.  The college was founded as a response to Columbia University's refusal to admit women into their institution.  It has been affiliated with Columbia University since 1900. Barnard confers the Bachelor of Arts degree in about 50 areas of study.  Students may also pursue elements of their education at the Juilliard School and The Jewish Theological Seminary also based in New York City. 

Order of Saint Benedict<====>4240<====>Order of Saint Benedict    The Order of Saint Benedict (OSB; Latin: Ordo Sancti Benedicti), also known in reference to the colour of its members' habits as the Black Monks, is a Catholic religious order of independent monastic communities that observe the Rule of Saint Benedict.  Each community (monastery, priory or abbey) within the order maintains its own  , while the order itself represents their mutual interests.  The terms "Order of Saint Benedict" and "Benedictine Order" are, however, also used to refer to all Benedictine communities collectively, sometimes giving the incorrect impression that there exists a generalate or motherhouse with jurisdiction over them. 

Bayezid I<====>4241<====>Bayezid I  Bayezid I ( ;   (nicknamed Yıldırım (Ottoman Turkish: یلدیرم), "Lightning, Thunderbolt"); 1354 – 8 March 1403)  was the Ottoman Sultan from 1389 to 1402.  He was the son of Murad I Lowry, Heath W.  (2003) The Nature of the Early Ottoman State.  Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, p.  153  Runciman, Steven The Fall of Constantinople.

Bayezid II<====>4242<====>Bayezid II  Bayezid II (3 December 1447 – 26 May 1512) (Ottoman Turkish: بايزيد ثانى Bāyezīd-i  s ānī, Turkish: II.  Bayezid or II.  Beyazıt) was the eldest son and successor of Mehmed II, ruling as Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1481 to 1512.  During his reign, Bayezid II consolidated the Ottoman Empire and thwarted a Safavid rebellion soon before abdicating his throne to his son, Selim I.  He is most notable for evacuating Sephardi Jews from Spain after the proclamation of the Alhambra Decree and resettling them throughout the Ottoman Empire. Early lifeBayezid II was the son of Mehmed II (1432–81) and Emine Gülbahar Hatun. 

Boxing<====>4243<====>Boxing    Boxing is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves, throw punches at each other for a predetermined set of time in a boxing ring. Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a common fixture in most international games—it also has its own World Championships.  Boxing is supervised by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds.  The result is decided when an opponent is deemed incapable to continue by a referee, is disqualified for breaking a rule, resigns by throwing in a towel, or is pronounced the winner or loser based on the judges' scorecards at the end of the contest. 

Bollywood<====>4246<====>Bollywood   Bollywood, formally known as Hindi cinema, is the Indian Hindi language film industry, based in the city of Mumbai (formerly Bombay), Maharashtra, India.  Bollywood is part of the larger cinema of India (also known as Indywood),  which includes other production centers producing films in other Indian languages.    Linguistically, Bollywood films tend to use a colloquial dialect of Hindi-Urdu, or Hindustani, mutually intelligible to both Hindi and Urdu speakers, while modern Bollywood films also increasingly incorporate elements of Hinglish.  Indian cinema is the world's largest film industry in terms of film production, with an annual output of 1,986 feature films as of 2017, and Bollywood its its largest film producer, with 364 Hindi films produced annually as of 2017. 

Bowls<====>4248<====>Bowls    Bowls or lawn bowls is a sport in which the objective is to roll biased balls so that they stop close to a smaller ball called a  "jack" or "kitty".  It is played on a bowling green which may be flat (for "flat-green bowls") or convex or uneven (for "crown green bowls").  It is normally played outdoors (although there are many indoor venues) and the outdoor surface is either natural grass, artificial turf, or cotula (in New Zealand). HistoryIt has been traced certainly to the 13th century, and conjecturally to the 12th.  William Fitzstephen (d. 

Barcelonnette<====>4249<====>Barcelonnette  Barcelonnette ( ;  ) is a commune of France and a subprefecture in the department of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region.  It is located in the southern French Alps, at the crossroads between Provence, Piedmont and the Dauphiné, and is the largest town in the Ubaye Valley.  The town's inhabitants are known as Barcelonnettes. ToponymyBarcelonnette was founded and named in 1231, by Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence.  Albert Dauzat and Charles Rostaing, Dictionnaire étymologique des noms de lieux en France, Éd.  Larousse, 1968, pp.  1693–1694.   While the town's name is generally seen as a diminutive form of Barcelona in Catalonia, Albert Dauzat and Charles Rostaing point out an earlier attestation of the name Barcilona in Barcelonnette in around 1200, and suggest that it is derived instead from two earlier stems signifying a mountain, *bar and *cin (the latter of which is also seen in the name of Mont Cenis). 

Bahá'í Faith<====>4251<====>Bahá'í Faith    The Bahá'í Faith (   ) is a religion teaching the essential worth of all religions, and the unity and equality of all people.   Established by Bahá'u'lláh in 1863, it initially grew in Iran (Persia) and other parts of the Middle East region, where it has faced ongoing persecution since its inception.    .  Currently it has between 5 and 7 million adherents, known as Bahá'ís, spread out into most of the world's countries and territories.    It grew from the mid-19th century Bábí religion, whose founder taught that God would soon send a prophet in the manner of Jesus or Muhammad. 

Burgundians<====>4257<====>BurgundiansThe Burgundians ( ;  ;   ;   ) were a large East Germanic or Vandal tribe, or group of tribes, who lived in the area of modern Poland in the time of the Roman Empire. In the late Roman period, as the empire came under pressure from many such "barbarian" peoples, a powerful group of Burgundians and other Vandalic tribes moved westwards towards the Roman frontiers along the Rhine Valley, making them neighbors of the Franks who formed their kingdoms to the north, and the Suebic Alemanni who were settling to their south, also near the Rhine. 

Dots and Boxes<====>4260<====>Dots and BoxesDots and Boxes is a pencil-and-paper game for two players (sometimes more).  It was first published in the 19th century by Édouard Lucas, who called it la pipopipette.   It has gone by many other names,   including the game of dots,  boxes,  dot to dot grid,  and pigs in a pen.   Starting with an empty grid of dots, two players take turns adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots.  The player who completes the fourth side of a 1×1 box earns one point and takes another turn. 

Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)<====>4261<====>Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)    DISPLAYTITLEBig Brother is a fictional character and symbol in George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.  He is ostensibly the leader (most likely a symbolic figurehead) of Oceania, a totalitarian state wherein the ruling Party wields total power "for its own sake" over the inhabitants. In the society that Orwell describes, every citizen is under constant surveillance by the authorities, mainly by telescreens (with the exception of the Proles).  The people are constantly reminded of this by the slogan "Big Brother is watching you": a maxim which is ubiquitously on display.  In modern culture the term "Big Brother" has entered the lexicon as a synonym for abuse of government power, particularly in respect to civil liberties, often specifically related to mass surveillance. 

Binary search algorithm<====>4266<====>Binary search algorithm    In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search,  logarithmic search,  or binary chop,  is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.    Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful.  If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array. 

Belle and Sebastian<====>4267<====>Belle and Sebastian    Belle and Sebastian are a Scottish band formed in Glasgow in January 1996.  Led by Stuart Murdoch, the band has released 9 albums to date.   Much of their work had been released on Jeepster Records, but they are now signed to Rough Trade Records in the United Kingdom and Matador Records in the United States.  Though often praised by critics,  Belle and Sebastian have enjoyed only limited commercial success.  HistoryFormation and early years (1996–1998)Belle and Sebastian were formed in Glasgow, Scotland in 1996 by Stuart Murdoch and Stuart David. 

Broadcast domain<====>4279<====>Broadcast domainA broadcast domain is a logical division of a computer network, in which all nodes can reach each other by broadcast at the data link layer.  A broadcast domain can be within the same LAN segment or it can be bridged to other LAN segments. In terms of current popular technologies, any computer connected to the same Ethernet repeater or switch is a member of the same broadcast domain.  Further, any computer connected to the same set of inter-connected switches/repeaters is a member of the same broadcast domain.  Routers and other higher-layer devices form boundaries between broadcast domains. 

Beechcraft<====>4282<====>Beechcraft Beechcraft is a brand of Textron Aviation    since 2014.  Originally, it was a brand of Beech Aircraft Corporation, an American manufacturer of general aviation, commercial, and military aircraft, ranging from light single-engined aircraft to twin-engined turboprop transports, business jets, and military trainers.

Battle of Peleliu<====>4283<====>Battle of Peleliu  The Battle of Peleliu, codenamed Operation Stalemate II by the United States military, was fought between the U. S.  and the Empire of Japan during the Mariana and Palau Campaign of World War II, from September to November 1944, on the island of Peleliu. U. S.  Marines of the 1st Marine Division, and later soldiers of the U. S.  Army's 81st Infantry Division, fought to capture an airstrip on the small coral island.  This battle was part of a larger offensive campaign known as Operation Forager, which ran from June to November 1944, in the Pacific Theater. 

Battle of Stalingrad<====>4284<====>Battle of Stalingrad   The Battle of Stalingrad (23 August 1942 – 2 February 1943)was a major confrontation of World War II in which Nazi Germany and its allies fought the Soviet Union for control of the city of Stalingrad (now Volgograd) in Southern Russia. Marked by fierce close quarters combat and direct assaults on civilians in air raids, it is often regarded as one of the single largest (nearly 2. 2 million personnel) and bloodiest (1. 7–2 million killed, wounded or captured) battles in the history of warfare. 

Bodhidharma<====>4285<====>Bodhidharma   Bodhidharma    was a Buddhist monk who lived during the 5th or 6th century.  He is traditionally credited as the transmitter of Chan Buddhism to China, and regarded as its first Chinese patriarch.  According to Chinese legend, he also began the physical training of the monks of Shaolin Monastery that led to the creation of Shaolin kungfu.  In Japan, he is known as Daruma. Little contemporary biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and subsequent accounts became layered with legend.According to the principal Chinese sources, Bodhidharma came from the Western Regions,   which refers to Central Asia but may also include the Indian subcontinent, and was either a "Persian Central Asian"  or a "South Indian [. 

Biconditional introduction<====>4286<====>Biconditional introduction In propositional logic, biconditional introduction    is a valid rule of inference.  It allows for one to infer a biconditional from two conditional statements.  The rule makes it possible to introduce a biconditional statement into a logical proof.  If  P \to Q  is true, and if  Q \to P  is true, then one may infer that  P \leftrightarrow Q  is true.  For example, from the statements "if I'm breathing, then I'm alive" and "if I'm alive, then I'm breathing", it can be inferred that "I'm breathing if and only if I'm alive". 

Biconditional elimination<====>4287<====>Biconditional elimination Biconditional elimination is the name of two valid rules of inference of propositional logic. It allows for one to infer a conditional from a biconditional. If  (P \leftrightarrow Q)  is true, then one may infer that  (P \to Q)  is true, and also that  (Q \to P)  is true.    For example, if it's true that I'm breathing if and only if I'm alive, then it's true that if I'm breathing, I'm alive; likewise, it's true that if I'm alive, I'm breathing. The rules can be stated formally as: \frac{(P \leftrightarrow Q)}{\therefore (P \to Q)} and \frac{(P \leftrightarrow Q)}{\therefore (Q \to P)} where the rule is that wherever an instance of " (P \leftrightarrow Q) " appears on a line of a proof, either " (P \to Q) " or " (Q \to P) " can be placed on a subsequent line;Formal notationThe biconditional elimination rule may be written in sequent notation: (P \leftrightarrow Q) \vdash (P \to Q) and (P \leftrightarrow Q) \vdash (Q \to P) where  \vdash  is a metalogical symbol meaning that  (P \to Q) , in the first case, and  (Q \to P)  in the other are syntactic consequences of  (P \leftrightarrow Q)  in some logical system;or as the statement of a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic: (P \leftrightarrow Q) \to (P \to Q)  (P \leftrightarrow Q) \to (Q \to P) where  P , and  Q  are propositions expressed in some formal system.See alsoLogical biconditionalReferences DEFAULTSORT

Base pair<====>4292<====>Base pairA base pair (bp) is a unit consisting of two nucleobases bound to each other by hydrogen bonds.   They form the building blocks of the DNA double helix, and contribute to the folded structure of both DNA and RNA.  Dictated by specific hydrogen bonding patterns, Watson-Crick base pairs (guanine-cytosine and adenine-thymine) allow the DNA helix to maintain a regular helical structure that is subtly dependent on its nucleotide sequence.   The complementary nature of this based-paired structure provides a backup copy of all genetic information encoded within double-stranded DNA.  The regular structure and data redundancy provided by the DNA double helix make DNA well suited to the storage of genetic information, while base-pairing between DNA and incoming nucleotides provides the mechanism through which DNA polymerase replicates DNA, and RNA polymerase transcribes DNA into RNA. 

Baltimore Ravens<====>4293<====>Baltimore Ravens  The Baltimore Ravens are a professional American football team based in Baltimore, Maryland.  The Ravens compete in the AFC North division of the National Football League.  The team plays its home games at M&T Bank Stadium and is headquartered in Owings Mills.  The Ravens were established in 1996, when Art Modell, who was then the owner of the Cleveland Browns, announced plans to relocate the franchise from Cleveland to Baltimore.   As part of a settlement between the league and the city of Cleveland, Modell was required to leave the Browns' history and records in Cleveland for a replacement team and replacement personnel that would take control in 1999. 

British National Party<====>4294<====>British National Party The British National Party (BNP) is a far-right and fascist political party in the United Kingdom.  It is headquartered in Wigton, Cumbria, and its current leader is Adam Walker.  A minor party, it currently has one councillor in UK local government.  During its heyday in the 2000s, it had over fifty seats in local government, one seat on the London Assembly, and two Members of the European Parliament. The BNP was formed in 1982 by John Tyndall and other former members of the National Front (NF).  By Tyndall's admission, it remained ideologically identical to the NF, and took its name from that of a defunct 1960s party. 

Batavi (Germanic tribe)<====>4295<====>Batavi (Germanic tribe)The Batavi were an ancient Germanic tribe that lived around the modern Dutch Rhine delta in the area that the Romans called Batavia, from the second half of the first century BC to the third century AD.  The name is also applied to several military units employed by the Romans that were originally raised among the Batavi.  The tribal name, probably a derivation from batawjō ("good island", from Germanic bat- "good, excellent," which is also in the English "better," and awjō "island, land near water"),  refers to the region's fertility, today known as the fruitbasket of the Netherlands (the Betuwe). 

Baptism<====>4298<====>Baptism    Baptism (from the Greek noun βάπτισμα baptisma; see below) is a Christian sacrament of admission and adoption,  almost invariably with the use of water, into the Christian Church generally.    The canonical Gospels report that Jesus was baptized —a historical event to which a high degree of certainty can be assigned.Baptism has been called a holy sacrament and an ordinance of Jesus Christ.  In some denominations, baptism is also called christening,   but for others the word "christening" is reserved for the baptism of infants.   Baptism has also given its name to the Baptist churches and denominations. 

Bocce<====>4300<====>Bocce   ( ), sometimes anglicized as bocci,    is a ball sport belonging to the boules family, closely related to British bowls and French  , with a common ancestry from ancient games played in the Roman Empire.  Developed into its present form in Italy  (where it is called  , the plural of the Italian word   which means 'bowl' in the sport sense),    it is played around Europe and also in overseas areas that have received Italian migrants, including Australia, North America, and South America (where it is known as  , or   ('Criollo balls') in Venezuela,   in Brazil). 

Beatmatching<====>4301<====>Beatmatching Beatmatching  or pitch cue is a disc jockey technique of pitch shifting or timestretching an upcoming track to match its tempo to that of the currently playing track, and to adjust them such that the beats (and, usually, the bars) are synchronised — i. e. , the kicks and snares in two house records hit at the same time when both records are played simultaneously.   Beatmatching is a component of beatmixing which employs beatmatching combined with equalization, attention to phrasing and track selection in an attempt to make a single mix that flows together and has a good structure. 

Beltane<====>4306<====>BeltaneBeltane ( )   is the anglicised name for the Gaelic May Day festival.  Most commonly it is held on 1 May, or about halfway between the spring equinox and the summer solstice.  Historically, it was widely observed throughout Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man.  In Irish the name for the festival day is Lá Bealtaine ( ), in Scottish Gaelic Là Bealltainn ( ) and in Manx Gaelic Laa Boaltinn/Boaldyn.  It is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals—along with Samhain, Imbolc and Lughnasadh—and is similar to the Welsh Calan Mai. 

Bethlehem<====>4312<====>Bethlehem   Bethlehem ( ; , "House of Meat";    ,  , "House of Bread";    ;  ) is a Palestinian city located in the central West Bank, Palestine, about   south of Jerusalem.  Its population is approximately 25,000 people.  Amara, 1999, p.  18.   Brynen, 2000, p.  202.   It is the capital of the Bethlehem Governorate.  The economy is primarily tourist-driven.The earliest known mention of the city was in the Amarna correspondence of 1350–1330 BCE during its habitation by the Canaanites. 

Benjamin<====>4313<====>Benjamin Benjamin ( ) was the last-born of Jacob's thirteen children (12 sons and 1 daughter), and the second and last son of Rachel in Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition.  He was the progenitor of the Israelite Tribe of Benjamin.  In the Hebrew Bible unlike Rachel's first son, Joseph, Benjamin was born in Canaan. In the Samaritan Pentateuch, Benjamin's name appears as "Binyaamem" ( ).  In the Quran, Benjamin is referred to as righteous young child, who remained with Jacob when the older brothers plotted against Joseph.  Later rabbinic traditions name him as one of four ancient Israelites who died without sin, the other three being Chileab, Jesse and Amram. 

Black Sabbath<====>4314<====>Black Sabbath Black Sabbath were an English rock  band, formed in Birmingham in 1968,  by guitarist and main songwriter Tony Iommi, bassist and main lyricist Geezer Butler, singer Ozzy Osbourne, and drummer Bill Ward.  Black Sabbath are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music.  The band helped define the genre with releases such as Black Sabbath (1970), Paranoid (1970) and Master of Reality (1971).  The band had multiple line-up changes, with Iommi being the only constant member throughout its history.  Formed in 1968 as the Polka Tulk Blues Band, a blues rock band, the group went through line up changes, renamed themselves as Earth, broke up and reformed. 

Buffalo Bills<====>4315<====>Buffalo BillsThe Buffalo Bills are a professional American football team based in the Buffalo–Niagara Falls metropolitan area.   The Bills compete in the National Football League (NFL), as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) East division.  The team plays their home games at New Era Field in Orchard Park, New York.  The Bills are the only NFL team that plays its home games in the state of New York (the New York Giants and New York Jets play at MetLife Stadium, located in East Rutherford, New Jersey).  The Bills conduct summer training camp at St. 

Big Dig<====>4318<====>Big Dig   The Central Artery/Tunnel Project (CA/T), known unofficially as the Big Dig, was a megaproject in Boston that rerouted the Central Artery of Interstate 93, the chief highway through the heart of the city, into the 3. 5-mile (5. 6 km) Thomas P.  O'Neill Jr.  Tunnel.  The project also included the construction of the Ted Williams Tunnel (extending Interstate 90 to Logan International Airport), the Leonard P.  Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge over the Charles River, and the Rose Kennedy Greenway in the space vacated by the previous I-93 elevated roadway.  Initially, the plan was also to include a rail connection between Boston's two major train terminals. 

Books of Chronicles<====>4319<====>Books of Chronicles   In the Christian Bible, the two Books of Chronicles (commonly referred to as 1 Chronicles and 2 Chronicles, or First Chronicles and Second Chronicles) generally follow the two Books of Kings and precede Ezra–Nehemiah, thus concluding the history-oriented books of the Old Testament,  often referred to as the Deuteronomistic history. In the Hebrew Bible, Chronicles is a single book, called Diḇrê Hayyāmîm ( , "The Matters [of] the Days"), and is the final book of Ketuvim, the third and last part of the Tanakh.  Chronicles was divided into two books in the Septuagint and called I and II Paralipoménōn ( , "things left on one side"). 

Binary search tree<====>4320<====>Binary search tree In computer science, binary search trees (BST), sometimes called ordered or sorted binary trees, are a particular type of container: data structures that store "items" (such as numbers, names etc. ) in memory.  They allow fast lookup, addition and removal of items, and can be used to implement either dynamic sets of items, or lookup tables that allow finding an item by its key (e. g. , finding the phone number of a person by name). Binary search trees keep their keys in sorted order, so that lookup and other operations can use the principle of binary search: when looking for a key in a tree (or a place to insert a new key), they traverse the tree from root to leaf, making comparisons to keys stored in the nodes of the tree and deciding, on the basis of the comparison, to continue searching in the left or right subtrees. 

Binary tree<====>4321<====>Binary tree In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the   and the  .  A recursive definition using just set theory notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a tuple (L, S, R), where L and R are binary trees or the empty set and S is a singleton set.Some authors allow the binary tree to be the empty set as well.    From a graph theory perspective, binary (and K-ary) trees as defined here are actually arborescences. 

Borel measure<====>4322<====>Borel measureIn mathematics, specifically in measure theory, a Borel measure on  a topological space is a measure that is defined on all open sets (and thus on all Borel sets).   Some authors require additional restrictions on the measure, as described below. Formal definitionLet  X  be a locally compact Hausdorff space, and let  \mathfrak{B}(X)  be the smallest σ-algebra that contains the open sets of  X ; this is known as the σ-algebra of Borel sets.   A Borel measure is any measure  \mu  defined on the σ-algebra of Borel sets. 

Blackadder<====>4326<====>Blackadder    Blackadder is a series of four BBC1 period British sitcoms, along with several one-off instalments.  All television episodes starred Rowan Atkinson as the anti-hero Edmund Blackadder, and Tony Robinson as Blackadder's dogsbody, Baldrick.  Each series was set in a different historical period, with the two protagonists accompanied by different characters, though several reappear in one series or another, for example Melchett (Stephen Fry) and Lord Flashheart (Rik Mayall). The first series, The Black Adder, was written by Richard Curtis and Rowan Atkinson, while subsequent episodes were written by Curtis and Ben Elton.  The shows were produced by John Lloyd. 

Boii<====>4327<====>Boii  The Boii (Latin plural, singular Boius;  ) were a Gallic tribe of the later Iron Age, attested at various times in Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy), Pannonia (Hungary and its western neighbours), parts of Bavaria, in and around Bohemia (after whom the region is named in most languages; comprising the bulk of the Czech Republic),  and Gallia Narbonensis.  In addition the archaeological evidence indicates that in the 2nd century BC Celts expanded from Bohemia through the Kłodzko Valley into Silesia, now part of Poland and the Czech Republic.  They first appear in history in connection with the Gallic invasion of north Italy, 390 BC, when they made the Etruscan city of Felsina their new capital, Bononia (Bologna). 

Backgammon<====>4329<====>Backgammon  Backgammon is one of the oldest board games known.  It is a two player game where each player has fifteen pieces (checkers) which move between twenty-four triangles (points) according to the roll of two dice.   The objective of the game is to be first to bear off, i. e.  move all fifteen checkers off the board.  Backgammon is a member of the tables family, one of the oldest classes of board games. Backgammon involves a combination of strategy and luck (from rolling dice).  While the dice may determine the outcome of a single game, the better player will accumulate the better record over series of many games, somewhat like poker. 

Book of Joshua<====>4331<====>Book of Joshua  The Book of Joshua (   ) is the sixth book in the Hebrew Bible (the Christian Old Testament) and the first book of the Deuteronomistic history, the story of Israel from the conquest of Canaan to the Babylonian exile. It tells of the campaigns of the Israelites in central, southern and northern Canaan, the destruction of their enemies, and the division of the land among the Twelve Tribes, framed by two set-piece speeches, the first by God commanding the conquest of the land, and, at the end, the last by Joshua warning of the need for faithful observance of the Law (torah) revealed to Moses. 

Book of Ezra<====>4332<====>Book of Ezra  The Book of Ezra is a book of the Hebrew Bible.  Originally combined with the Book of Nehemiah in a single book of Ezra–Nehemiah, the two became separated in the early centuries of the Christian era.  Fensham, F.  Charles, "The books of Ezra and Nehemiah" (Eerdmans, 1982) p. 1  Its subject is the Return to Zion following the close of the Babylonian captivity, and it is divided into two parts, the first telling the story of the first return of exiles in the first year of Cyrus the Great (538 BC) and the completion and dedication of the new Temple in Jerusalem in the sixth year of Darius I (515 BC), the second telling of the subsequent mission of Ezra to Jerusalem and his struggle to purify the Jews from marriage with non-Jews. 

Book of Daniel<====>4333<====>Book of Daniel  The Book of Daniel is a biblical apocalypse, combining a prophecy of history with an eschatology (the study of last things) which is both cosmic in scope and political in its focus.   In more mundane language, it is "an account of the activities and visions of Daniel, a noble Jew exiled at Babylon,"  its message being that just as the God of Israel saved Daniel and his friends from their enemies, so he would save all of Israel in their present oppression.  In the Hebrew Bible it is found in the Ketuvim (writings), while in Christian Bibles it is grouped with the Major Prophets. 

Batman<====>4335<====>BatmanBatman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.  The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger,  and first appeared in Detective Comics #27 (1939).  Originally named the "Bat-Man", the character is also referred to by such epithets as the Caped Crusader, the Dark Knight, and the World's Greatest Detective.  Fleisher, Michael L.  The Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes Volume 1 Batman Collier Books 1976   p.  31 Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and owner of Wayne Enterprises. 

Boston Red Sox<====>4339<====>Boston Red Sox    The Boston Red Sox are an American professional baseball team based in Boston, Massachusetts.  The Red Sox compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division.  The Red Sox have won eight World Series championships and have played in twelve.  Founded in   as one of the American League's eight charter franchises, the Red Sox' home ballpark has been Fenway Park since  .  The "Red Sox" name was chosen by the team owner, John I.  Taylor, around  , following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the "Boston Red Stockings", including the forerunner of the Atlanta Braves. 

Baltimore Orioles<====>4340<====>Baltimore Orioles   The Baltimore Orioles are an American professional baseball team based in Baltimore, Maryland.  The Orioles compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the American League East division.  As one of the AL's original eight charter franchises when the league was established in 1901, this particular franchise spent its first year as a major league club in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the Milwaukee Brewers before moving to St.  Louis, Missouri to become the St.  Louis Browns.  After 52 often-beleaguered years in St.  Louis, the franchise was purchased in November 1953 by a syndicate of Baltimore business and civic interests led by attorney/civic activist Clarence Miles and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr. 

Bastarnae<====>4342<====>Bastarnae The Bastarnae (Latin variants: Bastarni, or Basternae;  ) were an ancient people who between 200 BC and 300 AD inhabited the region between the Carpathian mountains and the river Dnieper, to the north and east of ancient Dacia.  The Peucini, denoted a branch of the Bastarnae by Greco-Roman writers, occupied the region north of the Danube delta. The ethno-linguistic affiliation of the Bastarnae was probably Germanic, which is supported by ancient historians and modern archeology.   However, ancient literary sources imply Celtic or Scytho-Sarmatian origins.   The most likely scenario is that they were originally a group of East Germanic tribes, originally resident in the lower Vistula river valley. 

Bohemia<====>4345<====>Bohemia    {{Infobox settlement }}Bohemia (   ;   ;   ;  ;  ;  ;  ) is the westernmost and largest historical region of the Czech lands in the present-day Czech Republic.  In a broader meaning, Bohemia sometimes refers to the entire Czech territory, including Moravia and Czech Silesia,  especially in a historical context, such as the Lands of the Bohemian Crown ruled by Bohemian kings. Bohemia was a duchy of Great Moravia, later an independent principality, a kingdom in the Holy Roman Empire, and subsequently a part of the Habsburg Monarchy and the Austrian Empire. 

BBC Radio 1<====>4348<====>BBC Radio 1BBC Radio 1 is a British radio station operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation which also broadcasts internationally, specialising in modern and current popular music and chart hits throughout the day.  Radio 1 provides alternative genres after 7 pm, including electronic dance, hip hop, rock, indie or interviews.  It was launched in 1967 to meet the demand for music generated by pirate radio stations, when the average age of the UK population was 27.   Recently, the BBC claimed that it still targets the 15 29 age group,  although the average age of its UK audience in 2008 had risen to 33. 

BBC Red Button<====>4349<====>BBC Red Button   BBC Red Button is a branding used for digital interactive television services provided by the BBC, and broadcast in the United Kingdom.  The services replaced Ceefax, the BBC's analogue teletext service.  The service can be accessed via Digital terrestrial television (DTT) (DVB-T), satellite television (DVB-S) and cable television (DVB-C).  History and brandingThe service was launched in September 1999 as BBC Text.  It was relaunched in November 2001 under the BBCi brand and operated under this name until late 2008, when it was rebranded as BBC Red Button.  The "red button" name refers to the common interface on remote controls for digital televisions and set-top boxes, a red push-button which launches digital teletext services. 

Backplane<====>4352<====>Backplane  A backplane (or "backplane system") is a group of electrical connectors in parallel with each other, so that each pin of each connector is linked to the same relative pin of all the other connectors, forming a computer bus.  It is used as a backbone to connect several printed circuit boards together to make up a complete computer system.  Backplanes commonly use a printed circuit board, but wire-wrapped backplanes have also been used in minicomputers and high-reliability applications. UsageEarly microcomputer systems like the Altair 8800 used a backplane for  the processor and expansion cards.  A backplane is generally differentiated from a motherboard by the lack of on-board processing and storage elements. 

Baldric<====>4353<====>Baldric  A baldric (also baldrick, bawdrick, bauldrick as well as other rare or obsolete variations) is a belt worn over one shoulder that is typically used to carry a weapon (usually a sword) or other implement such as a bugle or drum.    The word may also refer to any belt in general, but this usage is poetic or archaic. HistoryBaldrics have been used since ancient times, usually as part of military dress.  The early Islamic Arabs wore baldrics with their armor.  The design offers more support for weight than a standard waist belt, without restricting movement of the arms, and while allowing easy access to the object carried. 

Battle of Waterloo<====>4356<====>Battle of Waterloo The Battle of Waterloo was fought on Sunday, 18 June 1815, near Waterloo in present-day Belgium, then part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.  A French army under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated by two of the armies of the Seventh Coalition: a British-led Allied army under the command of the Duke of Wellington, and a Prussian army under the command of Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, Prince of Wahlstatt.   The battle marked the end of the 20 year Napoleonic Wars. Upon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition, and began to mobilize armies. 

Boomerang<====>4359<====>Boomerang   A boomerang is a tool, typically constructed as a flat airfoil that, when thrown, is designed to spin about an axis perpendicular to the direction of its flight.  A returning boomerang is designed to return to the thrower.  It is well known as a weapon used by Indigenous Australians for hunting. Boomerangs have been historically used for hunting, as well as a sport, and entertainment.  They are commonly thought of as an Australian icon,    and come in various shapes and sizes. DescriptionA boomerang is traditionally a long wooden device, although historically boomerang-like devices have also been made from bones. 

Bodybuilding<====>4360<====>Bodybuilding   Bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and develop one's musculature.   An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder.  In professional bodybuilding, bodybuilders appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank the competitors based on criteria such as symmetry, muscularity, and conditioning.  Bodybuilders prepare for competitions through a combination of intentional dehydration, elimination of nonessential body fat, and carbohydrate loading to achieve maximum vascularity, as well as tanning to accentuate muscular definition.  Bodybuilders may use anabolic steroids to build muscles. 

Biological warfare<====>4361<====>Biological warfareBiological warfare (BW)—also known as germ warfare—is the use of biological toxins or infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi with the intent to kill or incapacitate humans, animals or plants as an act of war.  Biological weapons (often termed "bio-weapons", "biological threat agents", or "bio-agents") are living organisms or replicating entities (viruses, which are not universally considered "alive") that reproduce or replicate within their host victims.  Entomological (insect) warfare is also considered a type of biological weapon.  This type of warfare is distinct from nuclear warfare and chemical warfare, which together with biological warfare make up NBC, the military acronym for nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare using weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). 

Book of Nehemiah<====>4362<====>Book of Nehemiah The Book of Nehemiah is a book of the Hebrew Bible often conjoined with the Book of Ezra.  Told largely in the form of a first-person memoir, it concerns the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem by Nehemiah, a Jew who is a high official at the Persian court, and the dedication of the city and its people to God's laws (Torah). SummaryThe events take place in the second half of the 5th century BC.  Listed together with the Book of Ezra as Ezra-Nehemiah, it represents the final chapter in the historical narrative of the Hebrew Bible. 

Book of Jeremiah<====>4363<====>Book of Jeremiah The Book of Jeremiah ( ; abbreviated Jer.  or Jerm.  in citations) is the second of the Latter Prophets in the Hebrew Bible, and the second of the Prophets in the Christian Old Testament.   The superscription at chapter 1:1–3 identifies it as "the words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah," and places the prophet historically from the reforms of king Josiah in 627 BC  through to the assassination of the Babylonian-appointed governor of Judah in 582.   Of all the prophets, Jeremiah comes through most clearly as a person, ruminating to his scribe Baruch about his role as a servant of God with little good news for his audience. 

Book of Isaiah<====>4364<====>Book of Isaiah  The Book of Isaiah ( ,  ) is the first of the Latter Prophets in the Hebrew Bible and the first of the Major Prophets in the Christian Old Testament.   It is identified by a   as the works of the 8th-century BCE prophet Isaiah ben Amoz, but there is ample evidence that much of it was composed during the Babylonian captivity and later.   Bernhard Duhm originated the view, held as a consensus through most of the 20th century, that the book comprises three separate collections of oracles:   Proto-Isaiah (chapters 1–39), containing the words of Isaiah; Deutero-Isaiah (chapters 40–55), the work of an anonymous 6th-century BCE author writing during the Exile; and Trito-Isaiah (chapters 56–66), composed after the return from Exile. 

Bilinear map<====>4365<====>Bilinear mapIn mathematics, a bilinear map is a function combining elements of two vector spaces to yield an element of a third vector space, and is linear in each of its arguments.  Matrix multiplication is an example. DefinitionVector spacesLet V, W and X be three vector spaces over the same base field F.  A bilinear map is a functionB : V × W → Xsuch that for any w in W, the mapv ↦ B(v, w)is a linear map from V to X, and for any v in V, the mapw ↦ B(v, w)is a linear map from W to X. 

Blind Blake<====>4366<====>Blind Blake   Arthur "Blind" Blake (1896 – December 1, 1934) was an American blues and ragtime singer and guitarist.  He is known for numerous recordings he made for Paramount Records between 1926 and 1932. Early lifeLittle is known of Blake's life.  Promotional materials from Paramount Records indicate he was born blind and give his birthplace as Jacksonville, Florida, and it seems that he lived there during various periods.  He seems to have had relatives in Patterson, Georgia.  Some authors have written that in one recording he slipped into a Geechee or Gullah dialect, suggesting a connection with the Sea Islands. 

Brian Lara<====>4367<====>Brian Lara Brian Charles Lara,    (born 2 May 1969) is a Trinidadian former international cricket player.    He is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.He topped the Test batting rankings on several occasions and holds several cricketing records, including the record for the highest individual score in first-class cricket, with 501 not out for Warwickshire against Durham at Edgbaston in 1994, which is the only quintuple hundred in first-class cricket history.  Lara also holds the record for the highest individual score in a Test innings after scoring 400 not out against England at Antigua in 2004. 

Beagle<====>4368<====>Beagle  The Beagle is a breed of small hound that is similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound.  The beagle is a scent hound, developed primarily for hunting hare.  With a great sense of smell and superior tracking instinct, the beagle is employed as detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world.  The beagle is intelligent but single-minded.  It is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and lack of inherited health problems. Although beagle-type dogs have existed for 2,500 years, the modern breed was developed in Great Britain around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot Hound, the North Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, and possibly the Harrier. 

Boiled leather<====>4371<====>Boiled leatherCuir bouilli or cuir-bouilli ( ,  ), meaning boiled leather, but often left in French in English, was a historical material for various uses common in the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period.   It was leather that had been treated so that it became tough and rigid, as well as able to hold moulded decoration.  It was the usual material for the robust carrying-cases that were made for important pieces of metalwork, instruments such as astrolabes, personal sets of cutlery, books, pens and the like.    It was used for some armour, being both much cheaper and much lighter than plate armour, but could not withstand a direct blow from a blade, nor a gunshot. 

Buffer overflow<====>4373<====>Buffer overflowIn computer security and programming, a buffer overflow, or buffer overrun, is an anomaly where a program, while writing data to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory locations. Buffers are areas of memory set aside to hold data, often while moving it from one section of a program to another, or between programs.  Buffer overflows can often be triggered by malformed inputs; if one assumes all inputs will be smaller than a certain size and the buffer is created to be that size, then an anomalous transaction that produces more data could cause it to write past the end of the buffer.

Barry Bonds<====>4375<====>Barry BondsBarry Lamar Bonds (born July 24, 1964) is an American former professional baseball left fielder who played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Pittsburgh Pirates and San Francisco Giants.Bonds received seven NL MVP awards and 14 All-Star selections, and is considered to be one of the greatest baseball players of all time. Bonds was regarded as an exceptional hitter: he led MLB in on-base plus slugging six times, and placed within the top five hitters in 12 of his 17 qualifying seasons. 

Book of Numbers<====>4376<====>Book of Numbers  The Book of Numbers (from Greek Ἀριθμοί, Arithmoi;  , Bəmiḏbar , "In the desert [of]") is the fourth book of the Hebrew Bible, and the fourth of five books of the Jewish Torah.   The book has a long and complex history, but its final form is probably due to a Priestly redaction (i. e. , editing) of a Yahwistic source made some time in the early Persian period (5th century BCE).    The name of the book comes from the two censuses taken of the Israelites. Numbers begins at Mount Sinai, where the Israelites have received their laws and covenant from God and God has taken up residence among them in the sanctuary. 

Book of Judges<====>4377<====>Book of Judges   The Book of Judges (Hebrew: Sefer Shoftim ספר שופטים) is the seventh book of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Bible.  In the narrative of the Hebrew Bible, it covers the time between the conquest described in the Book of Joshua and the establishment of a kingdom in the Books of Samuel, during which Biblical judges served as temporary leaders.   The stories follow a consistent pattern: the people are unfaithful to Yahweh and he therefore delivers them into the hands of their enemies; the people repent and entreat Yahweh for mercy, which he sends in the form of a leader or champion (a "judge"); the judge delivers the Israelites from oppression and they prosper, but soon they fall again into unfaithfulness and the cycle is repeated. 

Books of Samuel<====>4378<====>Books of Samuel The Books of Samuel,  1 Samuel and 2 Samuel, form part of the narrative history of Israel in the Nevi'im or "prophets" section of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament, and are considered by many biblical scholars to belong to the Deuteronomistic history, a series of books (Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings) that constitute a theological history of the Israelites and aim to explain God's law for Israel under the guidance of the prophets.   According to Jewish tradition, the book was written by Samuel, with additions by the prophets Gad and Nathan;  modern scholarly thinking is that the entire Deuteronomistic history was composed in the period c. 

Book of Revelation<====>4379<====>Book of Revelation    The Book of Revelation, often called the Revelation to John, the Apocalypse of John, The Revelation, or simply Revelation or Apocalypse (and often misquoted as Revelations), is a book of the New Testament that occupies a central place in Christian eschatology.  Its title is derived from the first word of the text, written in Koine Greek: apokalypsis, meaning "unveiling" or "revelation" (before title pages and titles, books were commonly known by their first words, as is also the case of the Hebrew Five Books of Moses (Torah).  The Book of Revelation is the only apocalyptic document in the New Testament canon (although there are short apocalyptic passages in various places in the Gospels and the Epistles). 

Books of Kings<====>4380<====>Books of Kings   The two Books of Kings, originally a single book, are the eleventh and twelfth books of the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament.  They conclude the Deuteronomistic history, a history of Israel also comprising the books of Joshua and Judges and the two Books of Samuel, which biblical commentators believe was written to provide a theological explanation for the destruction of the Kingdom of Judah by Babylon in c.  586 BCE and a foundation for a return from exile.  Sweeney, p.  1  The two books of Kings present a history of ancient Israel and Judah from the death of King David to the release of Jehoiachin from imprisonment in Babylon, a period of some 400 years ( ). 

Book of Ruth<====>4381<====>Book of Ruth   The Book of Ruth ( , Ashkenazi pronunciation:  , Megilath Ruth, "the Scroll of Ruth", one of the Five Megillot) is included in the third division, or the Writings (Ketuvim), of the Hebrew Bible; in most Christian canons it is treated as a history book and placed between Judges and 1 Samuel,  as it is set "in the days when the judges judged",  although the Syriac Christian tradition places it later, between Ecclesiastes and the Song of Songs.  It is named after its central figure, Ruth the Moabitess, the great-grandmother of David. 

Book of Esther<====>4382<====>Book of Esther  The Book of Esther, also known in Hebrew as "the Scroll" (Megillah), is a book in the third section (Ketuvim, "Writings") of the Jewish Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible) and in the Christian Old Testament.  It is one of the five Scrolls (Megillot) in the Hebrew Bible.  It relates the story of a Hebrew woman in Persia, born as Hadassah but known as Esther, who becomes queen of Persia and thwarts a genocide of her people.  The story forms the core of the Jewish festival of Purim, during which it is read aloud twice: once in the evening and again the following morning. 

Rail transport in Great Britain<====>4384<====>Rail transport in Great Britain The railway system in Great Britain is the oldest in the world.  Wagonways were built in Britain in the 1560s and soon spread across the country.  The first locomotive-hauled public railway opened in 1825.  Most of the railway track is managed by Network Rail, which in 2016 had a network of   of standard-gauge lines, of which   were electrified.   These lines range from single to quadruple track or more.  In addition, some cities have separate rail-based mass transit systems (including the extensive and historic London Underground). 

British Rail<====>4385<====>British Rail   British Railways (BR), which from 1965 traded as British Rail, was the state-owned company that operated most of the rail transport in Great Britain between 1948 and 1997.  It was formed from the nationalisation of the "Big Four" British railway companies and lasted until the gradual privatisation of British Rail, in stages between 1994 and 1997.  Originally a trading brand of the Railway Executive of the British Transport Commission, it became an independent statutory corporation in 1962 designated as the British Railways Board.  The period of nationalisation saw sweeping changes in the national railway network. 

Book of Job<====>4386<====>Book of Job The Book of Job ( ; Hebrew: אִיוֹב Iyov) is a book in the Ketuvim ("Writings") section of the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), and the first poetic book in the Old Testament of the Christian Bible.   Addressing the problem of theodicy – the vindication of the justice of God in the light of humanity's suffering  – it is a rich theological work setting out a variety of perspectives.   It has been widely and often extravagantly praised for its literary qualities, with Alfred, Lord Tennyson calling it "the greatest poem of ancient and modern times". 

Book of Proverbs<====>4388<====>Book of Proverbs The Book of Proverbs (Hebrew: מִשְלֵי, Míshlê (Shlomoh), "Proverbs (of Solomon)") is the second book of the third section (called Writings) of the Hebrew Bible and a book of the Christian Old Testament.   When translated into Greek and Latin, the title took on different forms: in the Greek Septuagint (LXX) it became Παροιμίαι Paroimiai ("Proverbs"); in the Latin Vulgate the title was Proverbia, from which the English name is derived. Proverbs is not merely an anthology but a "collection of collections" relating to a pattern of life which lasted for more than a millennium.   It is an example of the Biblical wisdom tradition, and raises questions of values, moral behaviour, the meaning of human life, and right conduct. 

Book of Lamentations<====>4389<====>Book of Lamentations  The Book of Lamentations ( , ‘Êykhôh, from its incipit meaning "how") is a collection of poetic laments for the destruction of Jerusalem.   In the Hebrew Bible it appears in the Ketuvim ("Writings"), beside the Song of Songs, Book of Ruth, Ecclesiastes and the Book of Esther (the Megilloth or "Five Scrolls"), although there is no set order; in the Christian Old Testament it follows the Book of Jeremiah, as the prophet Jeremiah is its traditional author.   Jeremiah's authorship is no longer generally accepted, although it is generally accepted that the destruction of Jerusalem by Babylon in 586 BCE forms the background to the poems. 

Book of Ezekiel<====>4390<====>Book of Ezekiel  The Book of Ezekiel is the third of the Latter Prophets in the Tanakh and one of the major prophetic books in the Old Testament, following Isaiah and Jeremiah.   According to the book itself, it records six visions of the prophet Ezekiel, exiled in Babylon, during the 22 years 593–571 BC, although it is the product of a long and complex history and does not necessarily preserve the very words of the prophet.  The visions, and the book, are structured around three themes: (1) Judgment on Israel (chapters 1–24); (2) Judgment on the nations (chapters 25–32); and (3) Future blessings for Israel (chapters 33–48). 

Big Brother (franchise)<====>4391<====>Big Brother (franchise)  Big Brother is a reality game show franchise created by John de Mol Jr. , originally broadcast in the Netherlands and subsequently syndicated internationally.  , there have been 387 seasons of Big Brother in over 54 franchise countries and regions. In the show, contestants called "housemates" (or "house guests") live together in a specially-constructed house that is isolated from the outside world.  Housemates are voted out (usually on a weekly basis) until only one remains and wins the cash prize.  During their stay in the house, contestants are continuously monitored by live television cameras as well as personal audio microphones. 

Bristol City F.C.<====>4392<====>Bristol City F. C. Bristol City Football Club is a professional football club in Bristol, England.  Their ground, Ashton Gate, is in the southwest of the city.  They currently play in the Championship, the second tier of English football, after winning League One in the 2014–15 season, only the second team to win both the third-tier championship and Football League Trophy in the same season. Bristol City won the Welsh Cup – despite being an English club – in 1934.  In 1907 they finished runners-up in Football League Division One, their highest ever final position. 

Bioterrorism<====>4393<====>Bioterrorism Bioterrorism is terrorism involving the intentional release or dissemination of biological agents.  These agents are bacteria, viruses, fungi, or toxins, and may be in a naturally occurring or a human-modified form, in much the same way in biological warfare. Definition According to the U. S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bioterrorism is the deliberate release of viruses, bacteria, toxins or other harmful agents to cause illness or death in people, animals, or plants.   These agents are typically found in nature, but could be mutated or altered to increase their ability to cause disease, make them resistant to current medicines, or to increase their ability to be spread into the environment. 

Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit<====>4396<====>Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit  The  Northrop (later Northrop Grumman) B-2 Spirit, also known as the Stealth Bomber, is an American heavy penetration strategic bomber, featuring low observable stealth technology designed for penetrating dense anti-aircraft defenses; it is a flying wing design with a crew of two.    The bomber can deploy both conventional and thermonuclear weapons, such as eighty  -class (Mk 82) JDAM Global Positioning System-guided bombs, or sixteen   B83 nuclear bombs.  The B-2 is the only acknowledged aircraft that can carry large air-to-surface standoff weapons in a stealth configuration. Development started under the "Advanced Technology Bomber" (ATB) project during the Carter administration; its expected performance was one of his reasons for the cancellation of the supersonic B-1A bomber. 

Beaver<====>4399<====>BeaverThe beaver (genus Castor) is a large, primarily nocturnal, semiaquatic rodent.  Castor includes two extant species, the North American beaver (Castor canadensis) (native to North America) and Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) (Eurasia).Beavers are known for building dams, canals, and lodges (homes).  They are the second-largest rodent in the world (after the capybara).  Their colonies create one or more dams to provide still, deep water to protect against predators, and to float food and building material.  The North American beaver population was once more than 60 million, but as of 1988 was 6–12 million. 

Bear<====>4400<====>BearBears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae.  They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans.  Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere.  Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.  Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails. While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets. 

Bald eagle<====>4401<====>Bald eagle    The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus, from Greek hali "sea", aiētos "eagle", leuco "white", cephalos "head") is a bird of prey found in North America.  A sea eagle, it has two known subspecies and forms a species pair with the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla).  Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and northern Mexico.  It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting. The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on fish, which it swoops down and snatches from the water with its talons. 

Brown bear<====>4402<====>Brown bear   The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is the most widely distributed bear and is found across much of northern Eurasia and North America.

It is one of the largest living terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in body size only by its close cousin, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is much less variable in size and slightly larger on average. 

BCS theory<====>4403<====>BCS theoryBCS theory or Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer theory (named after John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Robert Schrieffer) is the first microscopic theory of superconductivity since Heike Kamerlingh Onnes's 1911 discovery.  The theory describes superconductivity as a microscopic effect caused by a condensation of Cooper pairs into a boson-like state.  The theory is also used in nuclear physics to describe the pairing interaction between nucleons in an atomic nucleus. It was proposed by Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer in 1957; they received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this theory in 1972. HistoryRapid progress in understanding superconductivity gained momentum in the mid-1950s. 

Biathlon<====>4405<====>Biathlon   The biathlon is a winter sport that combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. HistoryAccording to Encyclopædia Britannica, the biathlon "is rooted in the skiing traditions of Scandinavia, where early inhabitants revered the Norse god Ullr as both the ski god and the hunting god". In modern times, the activity that developed into this sport was an exercise for Norwegian people that was an alternative training for the military.  Norwegian skiing regiments organized military skiing contests in the 18th century, divided in four classes: shooting at mark while skiing at top speed, downhill race among trees, downhill race on big hills without falling, and a long race on flat ground while carrying rifle and military pack. 

Bubble and squeak<====>4407<====>Bubble and squeak   Bubble and squeak is a traditional English dish made with the shallow-fried leftover vegetables from a roast dinner.  The main ingredient is potato but cabbage, carrots, peas, Brussels sprouts, or any other leftover vegetables can be added.  The chopped vegetables (and cold chopped meat if used) are fried in a pan together with mashed potatoes or crushed roast potatoes until the mixture is well-cooked and brown on the sides.  The dish is so named because the cabbage makes bubbling and squeaking sounds during the cooking process.   It is often served with cold meat from the Sunday roast, and pickles or brown sauce, or as an accompaniment to a full English breakfast. 

Buddy Holly<====>4408<====>Buddy Holly   Charles Hardin Holley (September 7, 1936 – February 3, 1959), known as Buddy Holly, was an American musician and singer-songwriter who was a central figure of mid-1950s rock and roll.  He was born in Lubbock, Texas, to a musical family during the Great Depression, and learned to play guitar and sing alongside his siblings.  His style was influenced by gospel music, country music, and rhythm and blues acts, and he performed in Lubbock with his friends from high school.  He made his first appearance on local television in 1952, and the following year he formed the group "Buddy and Bob" with his friend Bob Montgomery. 

Brewing<====>4410<====>Brewing   Brewing is the production of beer by steeping a starch source (commonly cereal grains, the most popular of which is barley)  in water and fermenting the resulting sweet liquid with yeast.   It may be done in a brewery by a commercial brewer, at home by a homebrewer, or by a variety of traditional methods such as communally by the indigenous peoples in Brazil when making cauim.   Brewing has taken place since around the 6th millennium BC, and archaeological evidence suggests that emerging civilizations including ancient Egypt  and Mesopotamia brewed beer.Since the nineteenth century the brewing industry has been part of most western economies.

Breast reconstruction<====>4419<====>Breast reconstructionBreast reconstruction is the rebuilding of a breast, usually in women.  It involves using autologous tissue or prosthetic material to construct a natural-looking breast.  Often this includes the reformation of a natural-looking areola and nipple.  This procedure involves the use of implants or tissue taken from other parts of the woman's body. Generally, the aesthetic appearance is acceptable to the woman, but the reconstructed area is commonly completely numb afterwards, which results in loss of sexual function as well as the ability to perceive pain caused by burns and other injuries.    TimingThe primary part of the procedure can often be carried out immediately following the mastectomy.

Brooklyn Historic Railway Association<====>4425<====>Brooklyn Historic Railway Association The Brooklyn Historic Railway Association's (BHRA) shop, trolley barn and offices are located in Red Hook, Brooklyn, New York, on the historic Beard Street Piers (c.  1870).  BHRA had a fleet of 16 trolleys (15 PCC trolleys and a leased 1897 trolley car from Oslo, Norway). History of projectThe BHRA's origin began with the rediscovery of the Cobble Hill Tunnel by Bob Diamond in 1980.  BHRA was formed in 1982 to restore the historic tunnel.  The Atlantic Avenue Tunnel (constructed in 1844) is the world's oldest subway tunnel.  BHRA successfully filed and received designation for the tunnel on the National Register of Historic Places. 

Beta-lactam<====>4427<====>Beta-lactam A  beta-lactam (β-lactam) ring is a four-membered lactam.   (A lactam is a cyclic amide. ) It is named as such because the nitrogen atom is attached to the β-carbon atom relative to the carbonyl.  The simplest β-lactam possible is 2-azetidinone. Clinical significanceThe β-lactam ring is part of the core structure of several antibiotic families, the principal ones being the penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monobactams, which are, therefore, also called β-lactam antibiotics.  Nearly all of these antibiotics work by inhibiting bacterial cell wall biosynthesis.  This has a lethal effect on bacteria, although any given bacteria population will typically contain a subgroup that is resistant to β-lactam antibiotics. 

Bishopric of Brandenburg<====>4429<====>Bishopric of Brandenburg  The Bishopric of Brandenburg (  or Dioecesis Brandenburgensis) was a Roman Catholic diocese established by King Otto I of Germany in 948, in the territory of the Marca Geronis (Saxon Eastern March) east of the Elbe river.  The bishopric was a suffragan diocese of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg, its seat was Brandenburg an der Havel.  The Prince-bishopric of Brandenburg ( ) was a state of the Holy Roman Empire for some time, probably starting about 1161/1165.  However, the Brandenburg bishops never managed to gain control over a significant territory, being overshadowed by the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which was originally seated in the same city. 

BASE jumping<====>4430<====>BASE jumping BASE jumping, also sometimes written as B. A. S. E.  jumping, is parachuting or wingsuit flying from a fixed structure or cliff.  "BASE" is an acronym that stands for four categories of fixed objects from which one can jump: building, antenna, span, and Earth (cliff).    Due to the lower altitudes of the jumps, BASE jumping is significantly more dangerous than skydiving from a plane.  In the U. S. , BASE jumping is currently regarded by many as a fringe extreme sport or stunt.In some jurisdictions or locations, BASE jumping is prohibited or illegal; in some places, however, it is permitted, like Perrine Bridge, in Twin Falls, Idaho. 

Beauty<====>4431<====>Beauty   Beauty  is a characteristic of an animal, idea, object, person or place that provides a perceptual experience of pleasure or satisfaction.  Beauty is studied as part of aesthetics, culture, social psychology, philosophy and sociology.  An "ideal beauty" is an entity which is admired, or possesses features widely attributed to beauty in a particular culture, for perfection. Ugliness is considered to be the opposite of beauty. The experience of "beauty" often involves an interpretation of some entity as being in balance and harmony with nature, which may lead to feelings of attraction and emotional well-being. 

Brownian motion<====>4436<====>Brownian motion  Brownian motion or pedesis (from"leaping" ) is the random motion of particles suspended in a fluid (a liquid or a gas) resulting from their collision with the fast-moving molecules in the fluid.    This pattern of motion typically alternates random fluctuations in a particle's position inside a fluid sub-domain with a relocation to another sub-domain.   Each relocation is followed by more fluctuations within the new closed volume.   This pattern describes a fluid at thermal equilibrium, defined by a given temperature.  Within such fluid there exists no preferential direction of flow as in transport phenomena. 

Barcelona<====>4443<====>Barcelona Barcelona ( ,  ,  ) is a city in Spain.  It is the capital and largest city of Catalonia, and the second most populous municipality of Spain.  With a population of 1. 6 million within city limits,  its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the Province of Barcelona and is home to around 4. 7 million people,    making it the sixth most populous urban area in the European Union after Paris, London, Madrid, the Ruhr area and Milan.   It is the largest metropolis on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Besòs, and bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range, the tallest peak of which is   high. 

Bandy<====>4444<====>Bandy    Bandy is a team winter sport played on ice, in which skaters use sticks to direct a ball into the opposing team's goal.   Based on the number of participating athletes, bandy is the world's second most popular winter sport after ice hockey.  Bandy also is the number two winter sport in tickets sold per day of competitions at the sport's world championship compared to the other winter sports.  The sport is considered a form of hockey and has a common background with association football, ice hockey and field hockey.

Booker Prize<====>4446<====>Booker Prize    The Man Booker Prize for Fiction (formerly known as the Booker-McConnell Prize and commonly known simply as the Booker Prize) is a literary prize awarded each year for the best original novel written in the English language and published in the UK.  The winner of the Man Booker Prize is generally assured international renown and success; therefore, the prize is of great significance for the book trade.   From its inception, only Commonwealth, Irish, and South African (and later Zimbabwean) citizens were eligible to receive the prize; in 2014, however, this eligibility was widened to any English-language novel—a change which proved controversial. 

Book of Joel<====>4447<====>Book of Joel The Book of Joel is part of the Hebrew Bible.   Joel is part of a group of twelve prophetic books known as the Twelve Minor Prophets.  (The term indicates the short length of the text in relation longer prophetic texts known as the Major Prophets. )ContentAfter a superscription ascribing the prophecy to Joel (son of Pethuel), the book may be broken down into the following sections:Lament over a great locust plague and a severe drought (1:1–2:17)The effects of these events on agriculture, farmers, and on the supply of agricultural offerings for the Temple in Jerusalem, interspersed with a call to national lament. 

Book of Hosea<====>4449<====>Book of Hosea  The Book of Hosea is one of the books of the Hebrew Bible.  According to the traditional order of most Hebrew Bibles, it is the first of the twelve Minor Prophets. Set around the fall of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, the Book of Hosea denounces the worship of gods other than Yahweh, metaphorically comparing Israel’s abandonment of Yahweh to a woman being unfaithful to her husband.  According to the book’s narrative, the relationship between Hosea and his unfaithful wife Gomer is comparable to the relationship between Yahweh and his unfaithful people Israel.  The eventual reconciliation of Hosea and Gomer is treated as a hopeful metaphor for the eventual reconciliation between Yahweh and Israel. 

Book of Obadiah<====>4450<====>Book of Obadiah  The Book of Obadiah is an oracle concerning the divine judgment of Edom and the restoration of Israel.   The text consists of a single chapter, divided into 21 verses, making it the shortest book in the Hebrew Bible.  In Judaism and Christianity, its authorship is attributed to a prophet who lived in the Assyrian Period and named himself in the first verse, Obadiah.  His name means “servant of Yahweh”. In Christianity, the Book of Obadiah is classified as a minor prophet of the Old Testament, due to its short length. In Judaism, Obadiah is considered a “later prophet”, placed in the last section (Nevi'im) of the Tanakh, where it is one of the "Twelve Prophets. 

Book of Jonah<====>4451<====>Book of Jonah The Book of Jonah is one of the Prophets in the Bible.

Book of Nahum<====>4453<====>Book of Nahum The Book of Nahum is the seventh book of the 12 minor prophets of the Hebrew Bible.  It is attributed to the prophet Nahum, and was probably written in Jerusalem in the 7th century BC.  BackgroundAccording to some,  Nahum prophesied in the beginning of the reign of Ahaz (740s BC).  Others, however, think that his prophecies are to be referred to the latter half of the reign of Hezekiah (8th century BC).  The book would then have been written in Jerusalem, where Nahum would have witnessed the invasion of Sennacherib and the destruction of his host (2 Kings 19:35).

It is used in the Epistle to the  , Epistle to the  , and the Epistle to the   as the starting point of the concept of faith. 

Backward compatibility<====>4459<====>Backward compatibilityBackward compatibility is a property of a system, product, or technology that allows for interoperability with an older legacy system, or with input designed for such a system, especially in telecommunications and computing.  Backward compatibility is sometimes also called downward compatibility.   Modifying a system in a way that does not allow backward compatibility is sometimes called " " backward compatibility.A complementary concept is forward compatibility, which is a design philosophy, usually based on open standards, that strives for methods that will continue to work with newer and future products.  Design that is forward-compatible usually has a roadmap for compatibility with future standards and products. 

Bacterial conjugation<====>4460<====>Bacterial conjugationBacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacterial cells by direct cell-to-cell contact or by a bridge-like connection between two cells.It is a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer as are transformation and transduction although these two other mechanisms do not involve cell-to-cell contact.    Bacterial conjugation is often regarded as the bacterial equivalent of sexual reproduction or mating since it involves the exchange of genetic material.  However, it is not sexual reproduction, since no exchange of gamete occurs.  During conjugation the donor cell provides a conjugative or mobilizable genetic element that is most often a plasmid or transposon.

Babrak Karmal (Dari/ , born Sultan Hussein; 6 January 1929 – 1 or 3 December 1996) was an Afghan politician who was installed as president of Afghanistan by the USSR when they invaded in 1979.  Karmal was born in Kamari and educated at Kabul University.  When the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) was formed, Karmal became one of its leading members, having been introduced to Marxism by Mir Akbar Khyber during his imprisonment for activities deemed too radical by the government.  He eventually became the leader of the Parcham faction when the PDPA split in 1967, with their ideological nemesis being the Khalq faction. 

Buddhist philosophy<====>4468<====>Buddhist philosophyBuddhist philosophy refers to the philosophical investigations and systems of inquiry that developed among various Buddhist schools in India following the death of the Buddha and later spread throughout Asia.  Buddhism's main concern has always been freedom from dukkha (unease),  and the path to that ultimate freedom consists in ethical action (karma), meditation and in direct insight (prajña) into the nature of "things as they truly are" (yathābhūtaṃ viditvā).  Indian Buddhists sought this understanding not just from the revealed teachings of the Buddha, but through philosophical analysis and rational deliberation.  Siderits, Mark.

BIOS<====>4473<====>BIOS For IBM PC compatible computers, BIOS (   ; an acronym for Basic Input/Output System and also known as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS or PC BIOS) is non-volatile firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup), and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs.   The BIOS firmware comes pre-installed on a personal computer's system board, and it is the first software run when powered on.  The name originates from the Basic Input/Output System used in the CP/M operating system in 1975.    Originally proprietary to the IBM PC, the BIOS has been reverse engineered by companies looking to create compatible systems. 

Bose–Einstein condensate<====>4474<====>Bose–Einstein condensate   A Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) is a state of matter of a dilute gas of bosons cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero.  Under such conditions, a large fraction of bosons occupy the lowest quantum state, at which point microscopic quantum phenomena, particularly wavefunction interference, become apparent.  A BEC is formed by cooling a gas of extremely low density, about one-hundred-thousandth the density of normal air, to ultra-low temperatures. This state was first predicted, generally, in 1924–25 by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein, and so it is only a theoretical state of matter. 

B (programming language)<====>4475<====>B (programming language)  B is a programming language developed at Bell Labs circa 1969.   It is the work of Ken Thompson with Dennis Ritchie. B was derived from BCPL, and its name may be a contraction of BCPL.   Thompson's coworker Dennis Ritchie speculated that the name might be based on Bon, an earlier, but unrelated, programming language that Thompson designed for use on Multics.  B was designed for recursive, non-numeric, machine-independent applications, such as system and language software.    HistoryInitially Ken Thompson  and later Dennis Ritchie  developed B basing it mainly on the BCPL language Thompson used in the Multics project. 

Beer–Lambert law<====>4476<====>Beer–Lambert law  The Beer–Lambert law, also known as Beer's law, the Lambert–Beer law, or the Beer–Lambert–Bouguer law relates the attenuation of light to the properties of the material through which the light is travelling.  The law is commonly applied to chemical analysis measurements and used in understanding attenuation in physical optics, for photons, neutrons or rarefied gases.  In mathematical physics, this law arises as a solution of the BGK equation. HistoryThe law was discovered by Pierre Bouguer before 1729.   It is often attributed to Johann Heinrich Lambert, who cited Bouguer's Essai d'optique sur la gradation de la lumière (Claude Jombert, Paris, 1729)—and even quoted from it—in his Photometria in 1760.

Beatrix Potter<====>4481<====>Beatrix Potter    Helen Beatrix Potter (British English  ,  North American English also  ,  28 July 1866 22 December 1943) was an English writer, illustrator, natural scientist, and conservationist best known for her children's books featuring animals, such as those in The Tale of Peter Rabbit. Born into a privileged household, Potter was educated by governesses and grew up isolated from other children.  She had numerous pets and spent holidays in Scotland and the Lake District, developing a love of landscape, flora, and fauna, all of which she closely observed and painted. Though Potter was typical of women of her generation in having limited opportunities for higher education, her study and watercolours of fungi led to her being widely respected in the field of mycology. 

Liberal Party (UK)<====>4482<====>Liberal Party (UK)  The Liberal Party was a political party which with the Conservative Party was one of the two major parties in the United Kingdom in the nineteenth and early twentieth century.    The party arose from an alliance of Whigs and free-trade Peelites and Radicals favourable to the ideals of the American and French Revolutions in the 1850s.  By the end of the nineteenth century, it had formed four governments under William Gladstone.  Despite being divided over the issue of Irish Home Rule, the party returned to government in 1906 with a landslide victory. 

Bank of England<====>4484<====>Bank of England The Bank of England, formally the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, is the central bank of the United Kingdom and the model on which most modern central banks have been based.  Established in 1694, it is the second oldest central bank in operation today, after the Sveriges Riksbank.  The Bank of England is the world's 8th oldest bank.  It was established to act as the English Government's banker and is still one of the bankers for the Government of the United Kingdom.  The Bank was privately owned by stockholders from its foundation in 1694 until it was nationalised in 1946. 

Bakelite<====>4485<====>Bakelite  Bakelite (   , sometimes spelled Baekelite), or polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride, is an early plastic.  It is a thermosetting phenol formaldehyde resin, formed from a condensation reaction of phenol with formaldehyde.  It was developed by the Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland in Yonkers, New York, in 1907. One of the first plastics made from synthetic components, Bakelite was used for its electrical nonconductivity and heat-resistant properties in electrical insulators, radio and telephone casings and such diverse products as kitchenware, jewelry, pipe stems, children's toys, and firearms.    The "retro" appeal of old Bakelite products has made them collectible. 

Bean<====>4487<====>Bean   A bean is a seed of one of several genera of the flowering plant family Fabaceae, which are used for human or animal food. TerminologyThe word "bean" and its Germanic cognates (e. g. ,  ) have existed in common use in West Germanic languages since before the 12th century,    referring to broad beans and other pod-borne seeds.  This was long before the New World genus Phaseolus was known in Europe.  After Columbian-era contact between Europe and the Americas, use of the word was extended to pod-borne seeds of Phaseolus, such as the common bean and the runner bean, and the related genus Vigna. 

Breast<====>4489<====>Breast The breast is one of two prominences located on the upper ventral region of the torso of primates.  In females, it serves as the mammary gland, which produces and secretes milk and feeds infants.   Both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues.  At puberty, estrogens, in conjunction with growth hormone, cause breast development in females. Subcutaneous fat covers and envelops a network of ducts that converge on the nipple, and these tissues give the breast its size and shape.  At the ends of the ducts are lobules, or clusters of alveoli, where milk is produced and stored in response to hormonal signals.

Black Death<====>4501<====>Black Death    The Black Death was one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, resulting in the deaths of an estimated   people in Eurasia and peaking in Europe from 1346 to 1353. The bacterium Yersinia pestis, resulting in several forms of plague, is believed to have been the cause.   The plague created a series of religious, social, and economic upheavals, which had profound effects on the course of European history. The Black Death is thought to have originated in the dry plains of Central Asia, where it then travelled along the Silk Road, reaching Crimea by 1343.

Battle of Poitiers<====>4503<====>Battle of PoitiersThe Battle of Poitiers was fought on 19 September 1356 in Nouaillé, near the city of Poitiers in Aquitaine, western France.  An army of English, Welsh, Breton and Gascon troops, many of them veterans of Crécy, led by Edward, the Black Prince, defeated a larger French and allied army led by King John II of France, leading to the capture of the king, his son, and much of the French nobility.    Poitiers was the second major English victory of the Edwardian phase of the Hundred Years' War.  Poitiers was fought ten years after the Battle of Crécy (the first major victory), and about half a century before the third, the Battle of Agincourt (1415). 

Backbone cabal<====>4505<====>Backbone cabalThe backbone cabal was an informal organization of large-site administrators of the worldwide distributed newsgroup-based discussion system Usenet.  It existed from about 1983 at least into the 2000s. The cabal was created in an effort to facilitate reliable propagation of new Usenet posts: While in the 1970s and 1980s many news servers only operated during night time to save on the cost of long distance communication, servers of the backbone cabal were available 24 hours a day.  The administrators of these servers gained sufficient influence in the otherwise anarchic Usenet community to be able to push through controversial changes, for instance the Great Renaming of Usenet newsgroups during 1987. 

Bongo (antelope)<====>4506<====>Bongo (antelope)    The bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus) is a herbivorous, mostly nocturnal forest ungulate.  It is among the largest of the African forest antelope species. Bongos are characterised by a striking reddish-brown coat, black and white markings, white-yellow stripes and long slightly spiralled horns.  Indeed, bongos are the only tragelaphid in which both sexes have horns.  They have a complex social interaction and are found in African dense forest mosaics. The western or lowland bongo, T.  e.  eurycerus, faces an ongoing population decline, and the IUCN Antelope Specialist Group considers it to be Near Threatened on the conservation status scale. 

Bunyip<====>4507<====>Bunyip    The bunyip is a large mythical creature from Australian Aboriginal mythology, said to lurk in swamps, billabongs, creeks, riverbeds, and  s. The origin of the word bunyip has been traced to the Wemba-Wemba or Wergaia language of Aboriginal people of South-Eastern Australia.  However, the bunyip appears to have formed part of traditional Aboriginal beliefs and stories throughout Australia, although its name varied according to tribal nomenclature.   In his 2001 book, writer Robert Holden identified at least nine regional variations for the creature known as the bunyip across Aboriginal Australia.

Genetically modified maize<====>4514<====>Genetically modified maizeGenetically modified maize (corn) is a genetically modified crop.  Specific maize strains have been genetically engineered to express agriculturally-desirable traits, including resistance to pests and to herbicides.  Maize strains with both traits are now in use in multiple countries.  GM maize has also caused controversy with respect to possible health effects, impact on other insects and impact on other plants via gene flow.  One strain, called Starlink, was approved only for animal feed in the US, but was found in food, leading to a series of recalls starting in 2000.  Marketed productsHerbicide resistant maizeCorn varieties resistant to glyphosate herbicides were first commercialized in 1996 by Monsanto, and are known as "Roundup Ready Corn". 

Body substance isolation<====>4516<====>Body substance isolationBody substance isolation is a practice of isolating all body substances (blood, urine, feces, tears, etc. ) of individuals undergoing medical treatment, particularly emergency medical treatment of those who might be infected with illnesses such as HIV, or hepatitis so as to reduce as much as possible the chances of transmitting these illnesses. BSI is similar in nature to universal precautions, but goes further in isolating workers from pathogens, including substances now known to carry HIV. Place of body substance isolation practice in historyPractice of Universal precautions was introduced in 1985–88.    In 1987, the practice of Universal precautions was adjusted by a set of rules known as body substance isolation. 

Boudica<====>4517<====>Boudica  Boudica or Boudicca (Latinised as Boadicea or Boudicea  , and known in Welsh as    )   was a queen of the British Celtic Iceni tribe who led an uprising against the occupying forces of the Roman Empire in AD 60 or 61, and died shortly after its failure.  She is considered a British folk hero. Boudica's husband, Prasutagus, ruled as a nominally independent ally of Rome and left his kingdom jointly to his daughters and the Roman emperor in his will.

In the north, the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak make up about 26% of the island. 

Ballpoint pen<====>4519<====>Ballpoint pen    A ballpoint pen, also known as a biro,  or ball pen by non-native English speakers in Asia, is a pen that dispenses ink over a metal ball at its point, i. e.  over a "ball point".  The metal commonly used is steel, brass, or tungsten carbide.   It was conceived and developed as a cleaner and more reliable alternative to dip pens and fountain pens, and it is now the world's most-used writing instrument:  millions are manufactured and sold daily.   As a result, it has influenced art and graphic design and spawned an artwork genre. 

Burroughs Corporation<====>4524<====>Burroughs Corporation  The Burroughs Corporation was a major American manufacturer of business equipment.  The company was founded in 1886 as the American Arithmometer Company, and after the 1986 merger with Sperry UNIVAC was renamed Unisys.

Northern bobwhite<====>4529<====>Northern bobwhite  The northern bobwhite, Virginia quail or (in its home range) bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) is a ground-dwelling bird native to the United States, Mexico, and the Caribbean.  It is a member of the group of species known as New World quails (Odontophoridae).  They were initially placed with the Old World quails in the pheasant family (Phasianidae), but are not particularly closely related.  The name "bobwhite" derives from its characteristic whistling call.  Despite its secretive nature, the northern bobwhite is one of the most familiar quails in eastern North America because it is frequently the only quail in its range. 

Bipolar disorder<====>4531<====>Bipolar disorder  Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depression, is a mental disorder that causes periods of depression and periods of elevated mood.    The elevated mood is significant and is known as mania or hypomania, depending on its severity, or whether symptoms of psychosis are present.   During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable.   Individuals often make poorly thought out decisions with little regard to the consequences.   The need for sleep is usually reduced during manic phases.   During periods of depression, there may be crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others.

Balts<====>4540<====>Balts   The Balts or Baltic people ( ,  ) are an Indo-European ethno-linguistic group who speak the Baltic languages, a branch of the Indo-European language family, which was originally spoken by tribes living in area east of Jutland peninsula in the west and Moscow, Oka and Volga rivers basins in the east.  One of the features of Baltic languages is the number of conservative or archaic features retained.   Among the Baltic peoples are modern Lithuanians, Latvians (including Latgalians) — all Eastern Balts — as well as the Old Prussians, Yotvingians and Galindians — the Western Balts — whose languages and cultures are now extinct. 

Burnt-in timecode<====>4541<====>Burnt-in timecodeBurnt-in timecode (often abbreviated to BITC by analogy to VITC) is a human-readable on-screen version of the timecode information for a piece of material superimposed on a video image.  BITC is sometimes used in conjunction with "real" machine-readable timecode, but more often used in copies of original material on to a non-broadcast format such as VHS, so that the VHS copies can be traced back to their master tape and the original time codes easily located.  Many professional VTRs can "burn" (overlay) the tape timecode onto one of their outputs.  This output (which usually also displays the setup menu or on-screen display) is known as the super out or monitor out. 

Bra–ket notation<====>4542<====>Bra–ket notation In quantum mechanics, bra–ket notation is a standard notation for describing quantum states.  It can also be used to denote abstract vectors and linear functionals in mathematics.  The notation begins with using angle brackets, ⟨ and ⟩, and a vertical bar, |, to denote the scalar product of vectors or the action of a linear functional on a vector in a complex vector space.   The scalar product or action is written as \langle\phi\mid\psi\rangle.  The right part is called the ket  ; it is a vector, typically represented as a column vector and written  |\psi\rangle. 

Blue<====>4543<====>Blue Blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments in painting and traditional colour theory, as well as in the RGB colour model.  It lies between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light.  The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres.   Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colors; azure contains some green, while ultramarine contains some violet.  The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering. 

Blind Willie McTell<====>4544<====>Blind Willie McTell    Blind Willie McTell (born William Samuel McTier; May 5, 1898 – August 19, 1959) was a Piedmont blues and ragtime singer and guitarist.  He played with a fluid, syncopated fingerstyle guitar technique, common among many exponents of Piedmont blues.  Unlike his contemporaries, he came to use twelve-string guitars exclusively.  McTell was also an adept slide guitarist, unusual among ragtime bluesmen.  His vocal style, a smooth and often laid-back tenor, differed greatly from many of the harsher voices of Delta bluesmen such as Charley Patton.  McTell performed in various musical styles, including blues, ragtime, religious music and hokum. 

BDSM<====>4545<====>BDSM    BDSM is a variety of often erotic practices or roleplaying involving bondage, discipline, dominance and submission, sadomasochism, and other related interpersonal dynamics.  Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practicing BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture is usually dependent upon self-identification and shared experience. The term "BDSM" is first recorded in a Usenet posting from 1991,  and is interpreted as a combination of the abbreviations B/D (Bondage and Discipline), D/s (Dominance and submission), and S/M (Sadism and Masochism). 

Bash (Unix shell)<====>4547<====>Bash (Unix shell)  Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell.    First released in 1989,    it has been distributed widely as the default login shell for most Linux distributions and Apple's macOS (formerly  ).  A version is also available for Windows 10.  Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window, where the user types commands that cause actions.  Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a  script. 

Blizzard<====>4548<====>Blizzard   A blizzard is a severe snowstorm characterized by strong sustained winds of at least   and lasting for a prolonged period of time—typically three hours or more.  A ground blizzard is a weather condition where snow is not falling but loose snow on the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds. Definition and etymologyIn the United States, the National Weather Service defines a blizzard as a severe snow storm characterized by strong winds causing blowing snow that results in low visibilities.  The difference between a blizzard and a snowstorm is the strength of the wind, not the amount of snow. 

Bikini<====>4550<====>Bikini   A bikini is usually  a women's abbreviated two-piece swimsuit with a bra top for the chest and underwear cut below the navel. The basic design is simple: two triangles of fabric on top cover the woman's breasts and two triangles of fabric on the bottom cover the groin in front and the buttocks in back.   The size of a bikini bottom can range from full pelvic coverage to a revealing thong or G-string design. The name for the bikini design was coined in 1946 by Parisian engineer Louis Réard, the designer of the bikini.

Battle of Jutland<====>4563<====>Battle of Jutland    The Battle of Jutland ( , the Battle of Skagerrak) was a naval battle fought by the British Royal Navy's Grand Fleet under Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, against the Imperial German Navy's High Seas Fleet under Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer during the First World War.  The battle unfolded in extensive manoeuvring and three main engagements (the battlecruiser action, the fleet action and the night action), from 31 May to 1 June 1916, off the North Sea coast of Denmark's Jutland Peninsula.   It was the largest naval battle and the only full-scale clash of battleships in that war. 

Bambara language<====>4565<====>Bambara language  The Bambara (Bamana) language, Bamanankan, is a lingua franca and national language of Mali spoken by perhaps 15 million people, natively by 5 million Bambara people and about 10 million second-language users.  It is estimated that about 80 percent of the population of Mali speak Bambara as a first or second language.  It has a subject–object–verb clause structure and two lexical tones. ClassificationBambara is a variety of a group of closely related languages called Manding, whose native speakers trace their cultural history to the medieval Mali Empire.   Varieties of Manding are generally considered (among native speakers) to be mutually intelligible – dependent on exposure or familiarity with dialects between speakers – and spoken by 30 to 40 million people in the countries Burkina Faso, Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Guinea, Liberia, Ivory Coast and the Gambia. 

Baku<====>4566<====>Baku   Baku (   ,    ;  ,  ) is the capital and largest city of Azerbaijan, as well as the largest city on the Caspian Sea and of the Caucasus region, with a population of 2,374,000.  Baku is located   below sea level, which makes it the lowest lying national capital in the world and also the largest city in the world located below sea level.  It is located on the southern shore of the Absheron Peninsula, alongside the Bay of Baku.  At the beginning of 2009, Baku's urban population was estimated at just over two million people. 

Balalaika<====>4567<====>Balalaika    The balalaika ( ,  ) is a Russian stringed musical instrument with a characteristic triangular wooden, hollow body and three strings.  Two strings are usually tuned to the same note and the third string is a perfect fourth higher.  The higher-pitched balalaikas are used to play melodies and chords.  The instrument generally has a short sustain, necessitating rapid strumming or plucking when it is used to play melodies.  Balalaikas are often used for Russian folk music and dancing. The balalaika family of instruments includes instruments of various sizes, from the highest-pitched to the lowest: the piccolo balalaika, prima balalaika, secunda balalaika, alto balalaika, bass balalaika, and contrabass balalaika.

Blind Lemon Jefferson<====>4569<====>Blind Lemon Jefferson Lemon Henry "Blind Lemon" Jefferson (September 24, 1893 – December 19, 1929)  was an American blues and gospel singer, songwriter, and musician.  He was one of the most popular blues singers of the 1920s and has been called the "Father of the Texas Blues".  Dicaire, David (1999).  Blues Singers: Biographies of 50 Legendary Artists of the Early 20th Century.  Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland and Company.  pp.  140–144.   .  Jefferson's performances were distinctive because of his high-pitched voice and the originality of his guitar playing.   His recordings sold well, but he was not a strong influence on younger blues singers of his generation, who could not imitate him as easily as they could other commercially successful artists. 

Baku (spirit)<====>4571<====>Baku (spirit)  are Japanese supernatural beings that devour dreams and nightmares.  According to legend, they were created by the spare pieces that were left over when the gods finished creating all other animals.

More than one-third of the development is parkland.The land upon which it is built was created by land reclamation on the Hudson River using over   of soil and rock excavated during the construction of the World Trade Center, the New York City Water Tunnel, and certain other construction projects, as well as from sand dredged from New York Harbor off Staten Island. 

Bacterial vaginosis<====>4581<====>Bacterial vaginosis    Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a disease of the vagina caused by excessive growth of bacteria. Common symptoms include increased vaginal discharge that often smells like fish.   The discharge is usually white or gray in color.   Burning with urination may occur.   Itching is uncommon.    Occasionally, there may be no symptoms.Having BV approximately doubles the risk of infection by a number of other sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS.   It also increases the risk of early delivery among pregnant women. 

Bud Selig<====>4582<====>Bud Selig  Allan Huber "Bud" Selig( ; born July 30, 1934) is an American baseball executive who currently serves as the Commissioner Emeritus of Baseball.  Previously, he served as the ninth Commissioner of Baseball.  He initially served as the acting commissioner beginning in 1992 before being named the official commissioner in 1998.Selig oversaw baseball through the 1994 strike, the introduction of the wild card, interleague play, and the merging of the National and American Leagues under the Office of the Commissioner.

Bison<====>4583<====>Bison  Bison are large, even-toed ungulates in the genus Bison within the subfamily Bovinae. Two extant and six extinct species are recognised.  Of the six extinct species, five went extinct in the Quaternary extinction event.  Bison palaeosinensis evolved in the Early Pleistocene in South Asia, and was the evolutionary ancestor of B.  priscus (steppe bison), which was the ancestor of all other Bison species.  From 2 MYA to 6,000 BC, steppe bison ranged across the mammoth steppe, inhabiting Europe and northern Asia with B.  schoetensacki (woodland bison), and North America with B.  antiquus, B. 

Baryon<====>4584<====>Baryon  A baryon is a composite subatomic particle made up of three quarks (a triquark, as distinct from mesons, which are composed of one quark and one antiquark).   Baryons and mesons belong to the hadron family of particles, which are the quark-based particles.   The name "baryon" comes from the Greek word for "heavy" (βαρύς, barys), because, at the time of their naming, most known elementary particles had lower masses than the baryons. As quark-based particles, baryons participate in the strong interaction, whereas leptons, which are not quark-based, do not.  The most familiar baryons are the protons and neutrons that make up most of the mass of the visible matter in the universe. 

Braille embosser<====>4589<====>Braille embosserA braille embosser is an impact printer that renders text as tactile braille cells.  Using braille translation software, a document can be embossed with relative ease, making braille production efficient and cost-effective. Blind users tend to call other printers "ink printers," to distinguish them from their braille counterparts.  This is often the case regardless of the type of printer being discussed (e. g. , thermal printers being called "ink printers" even though they use no ink). As with ink printers and presses, embossers range from those intended for consumers to those used by large publishers.  Thus, an embosser can cost roughly anywhere from US$2,000 to $150,000. 

Basic Role-Playing<====>4592<====>Basic Role-Playing  Basic Role-Playing (BRP) is a role-playing game system which originated in the RuneQuest fantasy role-playing game.  The BRP standalone booklet was first released in 1980 in the boxed set release of the second edition of RuneQuest.  Greg Stafford and Lynn Willis are credited as the authors.  A percentile skill-based system, BRP was used as the basis for most of the games published by Chaosium, including  Call of Cthulhu, Stormbringer, and Elfquest. HistoryThe core rules were originally written by Steve Perrin  as part of his game RuneQuest.   It was Greg Stafford's idea to simplify the rules (eliminating such things as Strike Ranks and Hit Locations) and issue them in a 16-page booklet called Basic Role-Playing. 

Block cipher<====>4594<====>Block cipher In cryptography, a block cipher is a deterministic algorithm operating on fixed-length groups of bits, called a block, with an unvarying transformation that is specified by a symmetric key.  Block ciphers operate as important elementary components in the design of many cryptographic protocols, and are widely used to implement encryption of bulk data. The modern design of block ciphers is based on the concept of an iterated product cipher.  In his seminal 1949 publication, Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems, Claude Shannon analyzed product ciphers and suggested them as a means of effectively improving security by combining simple operations such as substitutions and permutations. 

Wireless broadband<====>4595<====>Wireless broadband  Wireless broadband is technology that provides high-speed wireless Internet access or computer networking access over a wide area. The term broadbandOriginally the word "broadband" had a technical meaning, but became a marketing term for any kind of relatively high-speed computer network or Internet access technology. According to the 802. 16-2004 standard, broadband means "having instantaneous bandwidths greater than 1 MHz and supporting data rates greater than about 1. 5 Mbit/s. " The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently re-defined the definition to mean download speeds of at least 25 Mbit/s and upload speeds of at least 3 Mbit/s. 

Björn Borg<====>4601<====>Björn Borg   Björn Rune Borg ( ; born 6 June 1956) is a Swedish former world No.  1 tennis player widely considered to be one of the greatest in the history of the sport.  Between 1974 and 1981 he became the first man in the Open Era to win 11 Grand Slam singles titles (six at the French Open and five consecutive at Wimbledon).  He also won three year-end championships and 15 Grand Prix Super Series titles.  Overall, he set numerous records that still stand. A teenage sensation at the start of his career, Borg's unprecedented stardom and consistent success helped propel the rising popularity of tennis during the 1970s. 

Booch method<====>4603<====>Booch methodThe Booch method    is a method for object-oriented software development.   It is composed of an object modeling language,  an iterative object-oriented development process,  and a set of recommended practices.  The method was authored by Grady Booch when he was working for Rational Software (acquired by IBM), published in 1992 and revised in 1994.   It was widely used in software engineering for object-oriented analysis and design and benefited from ample documentation and support tools.    The notation aspect of the Booch method was superseded by the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which features graphical elements from the Booch method along with elements from the object-modeling technique (OMT) and object-oriented software engineering (OOSE). 

Battle of the Nile<====>4606<====>Battle of the Nile  The Battle of the Nile (also known as the Battle of Aboukir Bay;  ; was a major naval battle fought between the British Royal Navy and the Navy of the French Republic at Aboukir Bay on the Mediterranean coast off the Nile Delta of Egypt from 1 to 3 August 1798.  The battle was the climax of a naval campaign that had ranged across the Mediterranean during the previous three months, as a large French convoy sailed from Toulon to Alexandria carrying an expeditionary force under General Napoleon Bonaparte. 

Barnabas<====>4607<====>Barnabas    Barnabas (English:b|ɑr|n|ə|b|ə|s; Greek: Βαρνάβας), born Joseph, was an early Christian, one of the prominent Christian disciples in Jerusalem.  According to Acts 4:36, Barnabas was a Cypriot Jew.  Named an apostle in Acts 14:14, he and Paul the Apostle undertook missionary journeys together and defended Gentile converts against the Judaizers.  They traveled together making more converts (c 45–47), and participated in the Council of Jerusalem (c 50) Barnabas and Paul successfully evangelized among the "God-fearing" Gentiles who attended synagogues in various Hellenized cities of Anatolia. Barnabas' story appears in the Acts of the Apostles, and Paul mentions him in some of his epistles. 

Birka<====>4608<====>Birka  During the Viking Age, Birka   (Birca in medieval sources), on the island of Björkö (literally: "Birch Island") in present-day Sweden, was an important trading center which handled goods from Scandinavia as well as Central and Eastern Europe and the Orient.  Björkö is located in Lake Mälaren, 30 kilometers west of contemporary Stockholm, in the municipality of Ekerö.  The archaeological sites of Birka and Hovgården, on the neighbouring island of Adelsö, make up an archaeological complex which illustrates the elaborate trading networks of Viking Scandinavia and their influence on the subsequent history of Europe.  Generally regarded as Sweden's oldest town,  Birka (along with Hovgården) has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1993. 

Beta-lactamase<====>4609<====>Beta-lactamase  Beta-lactamases (β-lactamases, also known as penicillinase) are enzymes ( ) produced by bacteria, that provide multi-resistance to β-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins,  cephamycins, and carbapenems (ertapenem), although carbapenems are relatively resistant to beta-lactamase.  Beta-lactamase provides antibiotic resistance by breaking the antibiotics' structure.  These antibiotics all have a common element in their molecular structure: a four-atom ring known as a β-lactam.  Through hydrolysis, the lactamase enzyme breaks the β-lactam ring open, deactivating the molecule's antibacterial properties. Beta-lactam antibiotics are typically used to treat a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Beta-lactamases produced by Gram-negative organisms are usually secreted, especially when antibiotics are present in the environment. 

Burhanuddin Rabbani<====>4611<====>Burhanuddin Rabbani Burhānuddīn Rabbānī (Persian/Pashto:  ; b.  20 September 1940, d.  20 September 2011) was President of the Islamic State of Afghanistan from 1992 to 1996 (de jure until 2001).  After the Taliban government was toppled during Operation Enduring Freedom, Rabbani returned to Kabul and served as President from November to December 20, 2001, when Hamid Karzai was chosen at the Bonn International Conference on Afghanistan.Rabbani was also the leader of Jamiat-e Islami Afghanistan (Islamic Society of Afghanistan). He was one of the earliest founders and movement leaders of the Mujahideen in the early 1970s, right before the Soviet-Afghan War. 

Boeing 747<====>4614<====>Boeing 747   The Boeing 747 is an American wide-body commercial jet airliner and cargo aircraft, often referred to by its original nickname, "Jumbo Jet" .  Its distinctive "hump" upper deck along the forward part of the aircraft makes it among the world's most recognizable aircraft,  and it was the first wide-body produced.  Manufactured by Boeing's Commercial Airplane unit in the United States, the original version of the 747 was envisioned to have 150 percent greater capacity than the Boeing 707,  one of the common large commercial aircraft of the 1960s.  First flown commercially in 1970, the 747 held the passenger capacity record for 37 years. 

Battle of Agincourt<====>4615<====>Battle of Agincourt   The Battle of Agincourt ( ; in French, Azincourt  ) was a battle of the Hundred Years' War that resulted in an English victory.   The battle took place on 25 October 1415 (Saint Crispin's Day) in the County of Saint-Pol, Artois, some 40 km south of Calais (now Azincourt in northern France).    It was one of the most important English triumphs in the conflict, along with the battles of Crécy (1346) and Poitiers (1356).  England's victory at Agincourt against a numerically superior French army crippled France, and started a new period in the war, which was dominated by English military successes. 

Bronze Age<====>4620<====>Bronze Age  The Bronze Age is a historical period characterized by the use of bronze, proto-writing, and other early features of urban civilization.  The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the three-age Stone-Bronze-Iron system, as proposed in modern times by Christian Jürgensen Thomsen, for classifying and studying ancient societies. An ancient civilization is defined to be in the Bronze Age either by producing bronze by smelting its own copper and alloying with tin, arsenic, or other metals, or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere.  Bronze itself is harder and more durable than other metals available at the time, allowing Bronze Age civilizations to gain a technological advantage.

List of political scandals in the United Kingdom<====>4633<====>List of political scandals in the United Kingdom Political scandals in the United Kingdom are commonly referred to by the press and commentators as "'sleaze". SleazeA number of political scandals in the 1980s and 1990s created the impression of what was described in the British press as "sleaze": a perception that the then Conservative government was associated with political corruption and hypocrisy.  This was revived in the late 1990s due to accounts of so-called "sleaze" by the Labour government. List of scandals 1890sLiberator Building Society scandal,  in which the Liberal Party MP Jabez Balfour was exposed as running several vast fraudulent companies to conceal colossal financial losses. 

Bombardier Inc.<====>4635<====>Bombardier Inc.    Bombardier Inc.  ( ) is a multinational aerospace and transportation company based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  Starting as a maker of snow machines or snowmobiles, over the years it has grown into a large manufacturer of regional airliners, business jets, mass transportation equipment, and recreational equipment, and a provider of financial services. HistoryBombardier was founded by Joseph-Armand Bombardier as L'Auto-Neige Bombardier Limitée (loosely translated to "Bombardier Snow Car Limited") on July 10, 1942, at Valcourt in the Eastern Townships, Quebec.   A mechanic who dreamed of building a vehicle that could "float on snow,"  in 1937 Bombardier designed and produced his first snowmobile in a small Valcourt, Quebec repair shop. 

Break key<====>4636<====>Break key The Break key of a computer keyboard refers to breaking a telegraph circuit and originated with 19th century practice.  In modern usage, the key has no well-defined purpose, but while this is the case, it can be used by software for miscellaneous tasks, such as to switch between multiple login sessions, to terminate a program, or to interrupt a modem connection. Because the break function is usually combined with the pause function on one key since the introduction of the IBM Model M 101-key keyboard in 1985, the Break key is also called the Pause key.  It can be used to pause some computer games. 

Bogie<====>4640<====>Bogie A bogie (   )  (in some senses called a truck in North American English) is a chassis or framework carrying wheelsets, attached to a vehicle, thus serving as a modular subassembly of wheels and axles.  Bogies take various forms in various modes of transport.  A bogie may remain normally attached (as on many railway carriages [cars] and semi-trailers) or be quickly detachable (as the dolly in a road train or in railway bogie exchange); it may contain a suspension within it (as most rail and trucking bogies do), or be solid and in turn be suspended (as most bogies of tracked vehicles are); it may be mounted on a swivel, as traditionally on a railway carriage or locomotive, additionally jointed and sprung (as in the landing gear of an airliner), or held in place by other means (centreless bogies). 

British Steel (1967–1999)<====>4641<====>British Steel (1967–1999)   British Steel plc was a major British steel producer.  It originated from the nationalised British Steel Corporation (BSC), formed in 1967 which was privatised as a public limited company, British Steel plc in 1988.  It was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.  The company merged with Koninklijke Hoogovens to form Corus Group in 1999. HistoryAlasdair M.  Blair (1997), Professor of International Relations and Head of the Department of Politics and Public Policy at De Montfort University, has explored the history of British Steel since the Second World War to evaluate the impact of government intervention in a market economy. 

BT Group<====>4642<====>BT Group   BT Group plc (trading as BT and formerly British Telecom) is a holding company which owns British Telecommunications plc,  a British multinational telecommunications company with head offices in London, United Kingdom.  It has operations in around 180 countries and is the largest provider of fixed-line, mobile and broadband services in the UK, and also provides subscription television and IT services.  BT's origins date back to the founding of the Electric Telegraph Company in 1846 which developed a nationwide communications network.  In 1912, the General Post Office, a government department, became the monopoly telecoms supplier in the United Kingdom. 

Balmoral Castle<====>4644<====>Balmoral Castle  Balmoral Castle   is a large estate house in Royal Deeside, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, near the village of Crathie,   west of Ballater and   east of Braemar. Balmoral has been one of the residences for members of the British Royal Family since 1852, when the estate and its original castle were purchased privately by Prince Albert, consort to Queen Victoria.  They remain as the private property of the royal family and are not the property of the Crown. Soon after the estate was purchased by the royal family, the existing house was found to be too small and the current Balmoral Castle was commissioned. 

Breton language<====>4647<====>Breton language Breton   (or   in Morbihan) is a Southwestern Brittonic Celtic language spoken in Brittany. Breton was brought from Great Britain to Armorica by migrating Britons during the Early Middle Ages; it is thus an Insular Celtic language, and as such not closely related to the Continental Celtic Gaulish language which had been spoken in pre-Roman Gaul.  Breton is most closely related to Cornish, both being Southwestern Brittonic languages.   Welsh and the extinct Cumbric are the more distantly related Brittonic languages. The other regional language of Brittany, Gallo, is a langue d'oïl. 

Broch<====>4648<====>Broch    A broch ( ) is an Iron Age drystone hollow-walled structure of a type found only in Scotland.  Brochs belong to the classification "complex atlantic roundhouse" devised by Scottish archaeologists in the 1980s.  Their origin is a matter of some controversy.  Origin and definition The word broch is derived from Lowland Scots 'brough', meaning (among other things) fort.  In the mid-19th century Scottish antiquaries called brochs 'burgs', after Old Norse  , with the same meaning.  Place names in Scandinavian Scotland such as Burgawater and Burgan show that Old Norse   is the older word used for these structures in the north. 

Billy Crystal<====>4649<====>Billy Crystal   William Edward Crystal (born March 14, 1948) On page 17 of his book 700 Sundays, Crystal displays his birth announcement, which gives his first two names as "William Edward", not "William Jacob"is an American actor, writer, producer, director, comedian and television host.  He gained prominence in the 1970s for playing Jodie Dallas on the ABC sitcom Soap and became a Hollywood film star during the late 1980s and 1990s, appearing in the critical and box office successes When Harry Met Sally. . .  (1989), City Slickers (1991), and Analyze This (1999) and providing the voice of Mike Wazowski in the Monsters, Inc. 

Black hole<====>4650<====>Black holeA black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it.   The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.   The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon.  Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. 

Beta decay<====>4651<====>Beta decay  In nuclear physics, beta decay (β-decay) is a type of radioactive decay in which a beta ray (fast energetic electron or positron) and a neutrino are emitted from an atomic nucleus.  For example, beta decay of a neutron transforms it into a proton by the emission of an electron, or conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron (positron emission), thus changing the nuclide type.  Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay, but are created in the decay process.  By this process, unstable atoms obtain a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons. 

Blitzkrieg<====>4652<====>Blitzkrieg    Blitzkrieg (German, "lightning war" ) is a method of warfare whereby an attacking force, spearheaded by a dense concentration of armoured and motorised or mechanised infantry formations with close air support, breaks through the opponent's line of defence by short, fast, powerful attacks and then dislocates the defenders, using speed and surprise to encircle them.Through the employment of combined arms in manoeuvre warfare, blitzkrieg attempts to unbalance the enemy by making it difficult for it to respond to the continuously changing front, then defeat it in a decisive    (battle of annihilation). 

The Beano<====>4653<====>The Beano   The Beano is the longest running British children's comic, published by DC Thomson.  The comic first appeared on 30 July 1938,  and was published weekly.  In September 2009, The Beanos 3,500th issue was published.   One of the best selling comics in British popular culture, along with The Dandy, the weekly circulation of The Beano in April 1950 was 1,974,072.   The Beano is currently edited by Craig Graham.  Each issue is published on a Wednesday, with the issue date being that of the following Saturday. Its characters include Dennis the Menace, Minnie the Minx, The Bash Street Kids, The Numskulls, Roger the Dodger, Billy Whizz and Ball Boy. 

Bee<====>4654<====>Bee  Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the European honey bee, for producing honey and beeswax.  Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea and are presently considered a clade, called Anthophila.  There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families.  They are found on every continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants. Some species including honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees live socially in colonies. 

Basques<====>4660<====>Basques    The Basques (  or  ;    ;    ;    )  are an indigenous ethnic group characterised by the Basque language, a common culture and shared ancestry to the ancient Vascones and Aquitanians.Basques are indigenous to and primarily inhabit an area traditionally known as the Basque Country ( ), a region that is located around the western end of the Pyrenees on the coast of the Bay of Biscay and straddles parts of north-central Spain and south-western France. 

Bookkeeping<====>4662<====>Bookkeeping   Bookkeeping is the recording of financial transactions, and is part of the process of accounting in business. Transactions include purchases, sales, receipts, and payments by an individual person or an organization/corporation.  There are several standard methods of bookkeeping, such as the single-entry bookkeeping system and the double-entry bookkeeping system, but, while they may be thought of as "real" bookkeeping, any process that involves the recording of financial transactions is a bookkeeping process. Bookkeeping is usually performed by a bookkeeper.  A bookkeeper (or book-keeper) is a person who records the day-to-day financial transactions of a business. 

Bézier curve<====>4664<====>Bézier curveA Bézier curve  (pronounced  ) is a parametric curve frequently used in computer graphics and related fields.   Generalizations of Bézier curves to higher dimensions are called Bézier surfaces, of which the Bézier triangle is a special case. In vector graphics, Bézier curves are used to model smooth curves that can be scaled indefinitely.  "Paths", as they are commonly referred to in image manipulation programs, Image manipulation programs such as Inkscape, Adobe Photoshop, and GIMP.   are combinations of linked Bézier curves.  Paths are not bound by the limits of rasterized images and are intuitive to modify. 

Banach algebra<====>4665<====>Banach algebraIn mathematics, especially functional analysis, a Banach algebra, named after Stefan Banach, is an associative algebra A over the real or complex numbers (or over a non-Archimedean complete normed field) that at the same time is also a Banach space, i. e.  a normed space and complete in the metric induced by the norm.  The norm is required to satisfy  \forall x, y \in A : \|x \, y\| \ \leq  \|x \| \, \| y\|.   This ensures that the multiplication operation is continuous. A Banach algebra is called unital if it has an identity element for the multiplication whose norm is 1, and commutative if its multiplication is commutative. 

Boris Pasternak<====>4667<====>Boris Pasternak   Boris Leonidovich Pasternak ( ;    ) (  30 May 1960) was a Soviet Russian poet, novelist, and literary translator.  In his native Russian, Pasternak's first book of poems, My Sister, Life (1917), is one of the most influential collections ever published in the Russian language.  Pasternak's translations of stage plays by Goethe, Schiller, Calderón de la Barca and Shakespeare remain very popular with Russian audiences. Outside Russia, Pasternak is best known as the author of Doctor Zhivago (1957), a novel which takes place between the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the First World War. 

Binomial coefficient<====>4668<====>Binomial coefficientIn mathematics, any of the positive integers that occurs as a coefficient in the binomial theorem is a binomial coefficient.   Commonly, a binomial coefficient is indexed by a pair of integers   and is written  \tbinom{n}{k}.   It is the coefficient of the   term in the polynomial expansion of the binomial power  , and it is given by the formula \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}.  Arranging binomial coefficients into rows for successive values of  , and in which   ranges from 0 to  , gives a triangular array called Pascal's triangle.

It was created on 23 August 1873 for the Liberal politician Henry Bruce.  He served as Home Secretary from 1868 to 1873.   His grandson, the third Baron, was a soldier, cricketer and tennis player and a member of the International Olympic Committee.  His son, the fourth Baron, held office in the Conservative administration of Edward Heath and was later a Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords.   Lord Aberdare was one of the ninety-two elected hereditary peers that were allowed to remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. 

Boy band<====>4673<====>Boy band A boy band (or boyband) is loosely defined as a vocal group consisting of young male singers, usually in their teenage years or in their twenties at the time of formation,  singing love songs marketed towards young women.  Being vocal groups, most boy band members do not play musical instruments, either in recording sessions or on stage, making the term something of a misnomer.  However, exceptions do exist.  Many boy bands dance as well as sing, usually giving highly choreographed performances. Some such bands form on their own.  They can evolve out of church choral or gospel music groups, but are often created by talent managers or record producers who hold auditions. 

B-tree<====>4674<====>B-tree   In computer science, a B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.  The B-tree is a generalization of a binary search tree in that a node can have more than two children  .  Unlike self-balancing binary search trees, the B-tree is optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data.  B-trees are a good example of a data structure for external memory.   It is commonly used in databases and filesystems. OverviewIn B-trees, internal (non-leaf) nodes can have a variable number of child nodes within some pre-defined range. 

British Museum<====>4675<====>British Museum    The British Museum, located in the Bloomsbury area of London, United Kingdom, is a public institution dedicated to human history, art and culture.  Its permanent collection, numbering some 8 million works,    is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence  and originates from all continents, illustrating and documenting the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present.  Sculptures and applied art are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum houses earlier art, non-Western art, prints and drawings, and art of a later date is at Tate Modern. 

Binomial theorem<====>4677<====>Binomial theoremIn elementary algebra, the binomial theorem (or binomial expansion) describes the algebraic expansion of powers of a binomial.   According to the theorem, it is possible to expand the polynomial   into a sum involving terms of the form   , where the exponents   and   are nonnegative integers with  , and the coefficient   of each term is a specific positive integer depending on   and  .   For example, (x+y)^4 = x^4 + 4 x^3y + 6 x^2 y^2 + 4 x y^3 + y^4.  The coefficient   in the term of   is known as the binomial coefficient  \tbinom nb  or  \tbinom nc  (the two have the same value).

Boolean satisfiability problem<====>4715<====>Boolean satisfiability problem In computer science, the Boolean satisfiability problem (sometimes called Propositional Satisfiability Problem and abbreviated as SATISFIABILITY or SAT) is the problem of determining if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula.  In other words, it asks whether the variables of a given Boolean formula can be consistently replaced by the values TRUE or FALSE in such a way that the formula evaluates to TRUE.  If this is the case, the formula is called satisfiable.  On the other hand, if no such assignment exists, the function expressed by the formula is FALSE for all possible variable assignments and the formula is unsatisfiable.

Bi-directional text<====>4733<====>Bi-directional text Bi-directional text is text containing text in both text directionalities, both right-to-left (RTL or dextrosinistral) and left-to-right (LTR or sinistrodextral).  It generally involves text containing different types of alphabets, but may also refer to boustrophedon, which is changing text directionality in each row. Some writing systems of the world, including the Arabic and Hebrew scripts or derived systems such as the Persian, Urdu, and Yiddish scripts, are written in a form known as right-to-left (RTL), in which writing begins at the right-hand side of a page and concludes at the left-hand side.  This is different from the left-to-right (LTR) direction used by most writing systems in the world. 

Bernoulli's inequality<====>4734<====>Bernoulli's inequalityIn real analysis, Bernoulli's inequality (named after Jacob Bernoulli) is an inequality that approximates exponentiations of 1 + x. The inequality states that (1 + x)^r \geq 1 + rx for every integer r ≥ 0 and every real number x ≥ −1.  If the exponent r is even, then the inequality is valid for all real numbers x.  The strict version of the inequality reads (1 + x)^r > 1 + rx for every integer r ≥ 2 and every real number x ≥ −1 with x ≠ 0. There is also a generalized version that says for every real number r ≥ 1 and real number x ≥ -1, (1 + x)^r \geq 1 + rx, while for 0 ≤ r ≤ 1 and real number x ≥ -1, (1 + x)^r \leq 1 + rx.

Blue Steel (missile)<====>4777<====>Blue Steel (missile)   The Avro Blue Steel was a British air-launched, rocket-propelled nuclear armed standoff missile, built to arm the V bomber force.  It allowed the bomber to launch the missile against its target while still outside the range of surface-to-air missiles (SAMs).  The missile proceeded to the target at speeds up to Mach 3, and would trigger within 100 m of the pre-defined target point. Blue Steel entered service in 1963, by which point improved SAMs with longer range had greatly eroded the advantages of the design.  A longer-range version, Blue Steel II, was considered, but cancelled in favour of the much longer-range GAM-87 Skybolt system from the US.

The group gained notoriety in 1993, when federal authorities laid a siege on a compound controlled by a group under David Koresh which abandoned many Davidian teachings and became a new religious movement with him as its self-proclaimed final prophet. Some of those who accepted the reform message had been removed from membership of the Seventh-day Adventist Church because their teachings were seen as heretical by fellow Adventists. 

Burwash Hall<====>4779<====>Burwash Hall Burwash Hall is the second oldest of the residence buildings at Toronto's Victoria College.   Construction began in 1911 and was completed in 1913.   It was named after Nathanael Burwash, a former president of Victoria.   The building is an extravagant Neo-Gothic work with turrets, gargoyles, and battlements.   The architect was Henry Sproatt. The building is divided between the large dining hall in the northwest and the student residence proper.   The residence area is divided into two sections.   The Upper Houses, built in 1913, consist of four houses: North House, Middle House, Gate House, and South House. 

Benzodiazepine<====>4781<====>Benzodiazepine   Benzodiazepines (BZD, BZs), sometimes called "benzos", are a class of psychoactive drugs whose core chemical structure is the fusion of a benzene ring and a diazepine ring.  The first such drug, chlordiazepoxide (Librium), was discovered accidentally by Leo Sternbach in 1955, and made available in 1960 by Hoffmann–La Roche, which, since 1963, has also marketed the benzodiazepine diazepam (Valium).   In 1977 benzodiazepines were globally the most prescribed medications.   They are in the family of drugs commonly known as minor tranquilizers.   Benzodiazepines enhance the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA A  receptor, resulting in sedative, hypnotic (sleep-inducing), anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties. 

Body mass index<====>4788<====>Body mass index  The body mass index (BMI) or Quetelet index is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of an individual.  The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of kg/m 2 , resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres. The BMI may also be determined using a table e. g. , the Body Mass Index Table   from the National Institutes of Health's NHLBI.   or chart which displays BMI as a function of mass and height using contour lines or colours for different BMI categories, and which may use other units of measurement (converted to metric units for the calculation). 

Behistun Inscription<====>4789<====>Behistun Inscription   The Behistun Inscription (also Bisotun, Bistun or Bisutun;  , Old Persian: Bagastana, meaning "the place of god") is a multilingual inscription and large rock relief on a cliff at Mount Behistun in the Kermanshah Province of Iran, near the city of Kermanshah in western Iran.  It was crucial to the decipherment of cuneiform script. Authored by Darius the Great sometime between his coronation as king of the Persian Empire in the summer of 522 BC and his death in autumn of 486 BC, the inscription begins with a brief autobiography of Darius, including his ancestry and lineage. 

Barry Goldwater<====>4792<====>Barry GoldwaterBarry Morris Goldwater (January 2, 1909  – May 29, 1998) was an American politician, businessman, and author who was a five-term United States Senator from Arizona (1953–65, 1969–87) and the Republican Party's nominee for President of the United States in the 1964 election.  Despite losing the election by a landslide, Goldwater is the politician most often credited for sparking the resurgence of the American conservative political movement in the 1960s.  He was a vocal opponent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, believing it was an overreach of federal government.  He also had a substantial impact on the libertarian movement. 

Baralong incidents<====>4794<====>Baralong incidentsDISPLAYTITLE   The Baralong incidents were naval engagements of the First World War in August and September 1915, involving the Royal Navy Q-ship  , later renamed HMS Wyandra, and two German U-boats. Baralong sank  , which had been preparing to sink a nearby merchant ship, the Nicosian.  About a dozen of the crewmen managed to escape from the sinking submarine, and Lieutenant Godfrey Herbert, commanding officer of Baralong, ordered the surviving sailors to be summarily executed after they boarded the Nicosian.  All the survivors of U-27 s sinking, including several who had reached the Nicosian, were shot by Baralong s crew.

BeOS<====>4801<====>BeOS  BeOS is an operating system for personal computers first developed by Be Inc.  in 1991.  It was first written to run on BeBox hardware.  BeOS was built for digital media work and was written to take advantage of modern hardware facilities such as symmetric multiprocessing by utilizing modular I/O bandwidth, pervasive multithreading, preemptive multitasking and a 64-bit journaling file system known as BFS.  The BeOS GUI was developed on the principles of clarity and a clean, uncluttered design. BeOS was positioned as a multimedia platform which could be used by a substantial population of desktop users and a competitor to Classic Mac OS and Microsoft Windows. 

Biome<====>4802<====>Biome   A biome   is a community of plants and animals that have common characteristics for the environment they exist in.  They can be found over a range of continents.  Biomes are distinct biological communities that have formed in response to a shared physical climate."Biome" is a broader term than "habitat"; any biome can comprise a variety of habitats. While a biome can cover large areas, a microbiome is a mix of organisms that coexist in a defined space on a much smaller scale.   For example, the human microbiome is the collection of bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that are present on a human body. 

Behavior<====>4805<====>Behavior  Behavior (American English) or behaviour (Commonwealth English) is the range of actions and mannerisms made by individuals, organisms, systems, or artificial entities in conjunction with themselves or their environment, which includes the other systems or organisms around as well as the (inanimate) physical environment.  It is the response of the system or organism to various stimuli or inputs, whether internal or external, conscious or subconscious, overt or covert, and voluntary or involuntary.  Taking a behavior informatics perspective, a behavior consists of behavior actor, operation, interactions, and their properties.  A behavior can be represented as a behavior vector. 

Battle of Marathon<====>4806<====>Battle of Marathon    The Battle of Marathon (Greek:  , Machē tou Marathōnos) took place in 490 BC, during the first Persian invasion of Greece.  It was fought between the citizens of Athens, aided by Plataea, and a Persian force commanded by Datis and Artaphernes.  The battle was the culmination of the first attempt by Persia, under King Darius I, to subjugate Greece.  The Greek army decisively defeated the more numerous Persians, marking a turning point in the Greco-Persian Wars. The first Persian invasion was a response to Athenian involvement in the Ionian Revolt, when Athens and Eretria had sent a force to support the cities of Ionia in their attempt to overthrow Persian rule. 

Balance of trade<====>4810<====>Balance of trade The balance of trade, commercial balance, or net exports (sometimes symbolized as NX), is the difference between the monetary value of a nation's exports and imports over a certain period.   Sometimes a distinction is made between a balance of trade for goods versus one for services. If a country exports a greater value than it imports, it is called a trade surplus, positive balance, or a "favourable balance", and conversely, if a country imports a greater value than it exports, it is called a trade deficit, negative balance, "unfavorable balance", or, informally, a "trade gap". 

Biosphere<====>4816<====>Biosphere The biosphere (from Greek βίος bíos "life" and σφαῖρα sphaira "sphere") also known as the ecosphere (from Greek οἶκος oîkos "environment" and σφαῖρα), is the worldwide sum of all ecosystems.  It can also be termed as the zone of life on Earth, a closed system (apart from solar and cosmic radiation and heat from the interior of the Earth), and largely self-regulating.By the most general biophysiological definition, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere. 

Biological membrane<====>4817<====>Biological membrane A biological membrane or biomembrane is an enclosing or separating membrane that acts as a selectively permeable barrier within living things.  Biological membranes, in the form of eukaryotic cell membranes, consist of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded, integral and peripheral proteins used in communication and transportation of chemicals and ions.  The bulk of lipid in a cell membrane provides a fluid matrix for proteins to rotate and laterally diffuse for physiological functioning.  Proteins are adapted to high membrane fluidity environment of lipid bilayer with the presence of an annular lipid shell, consisting of lipid molecules bound tightly to surface of integral membrane proteins. 

Balfour Declaration of 1926<====>4819<====>Balfour Declaration of 1926   The Balfour Declaration of 1926, issued by the 1926 Imperial Conference of British Empire leaders in London, was named for Lord President of the Council (and former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom) Arthur Balfour.  It declared the United Kingdom and the Dominions to be: The Inter-Imperial Relations Committee, chaired by Balfour, drew up the document preparatory to its unanimous approval by the imperial premiers on 15 November 1926. It was first proposed by South African Prime Minister J.  B.  M.  Hertzog and Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. 

Balfour Declaration<====>4820<====>Balfour DeclarationThe Balfour Declaration was a public statement issued by the British government during World War I announcing support for the establishment of a  "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine, then an Ottoman region with a minority Jewish population (around 3-5% of the total).  It read: The declaration was contained in a letter dated 2 November 1917 from the United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Lord Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community, for transmission to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland.  The text of the declaration was published in the press on 9 November 1917. 

Black Hand (Serbia)<====>4821<====>Black Hand (Serbia)  Unification or Death ( ), popularly known as the Black Hand (Црна рука / Crna ruka), was a secret military society formed on 9 May 1911 by officers in the Army of the Kingdom of Serbia, originating in the conspiracy group that assassinated the Serbian royal couple (1903), led by captain Dragutin Dimitrijević "Apis". It was formed with the aim of uniting all of the territories with a South Slavic majority not ruled by either Serbia or Montenegro.  Its inspiration was primarily the unification of Italy in 1859–70, but also that of Germany in 1871. 

Board of directors<====>4822<====>Board of directors  A board of directors is a recognized group of people who jointly oversee the activities of an organization, which can be either a for-profit business, nonprofit organization, or a government agency.  Such a board's powers, duties, and responsibilities are determined by government regulations (including the jurisdiction's corporations law) and the organization's own constitution and bylaws.  These authorities may specify the number of members of the board, how they are to be chosen, and how often they are to meet. In an organization with voting members, the board is accountable to, and might be subordinate to, the organization's full membership, which usually vote for the members of the board. 

Balkan Wars<====>4823<====>Balkan Wars The Balkan Wars ( , literally "the Balkan Wars" or Balkan Faciası, meaning "the Balkan Tragedy") consisted of two conflicts that took place in the Balkan Peninsula in 1912 and 1913.  Four Balkan states defeated the Ottoman Empire in the first war; one of the four, Bulgaria, suffered defeat in the second war.  The Ottoman Empire lost the bulk of its territory in Europe.  Austria-Hungary, although not a combatant, became relatively weaker as a much enlarged Serbia pushed for union of the South Slavic peoples.   The war set the stage for the Balkan crisis of 1914 and thus served as a "prelude to the First World War".

Biomedical engineering<====>4827<====>Biomedical engineering  Biomedical engineering (BME) is the application of engineering principles and design concepts to medicine and biology for healthcare purposes (e. g.  diagnostic or therapeutic).  This field seeks to close the gap between engineering and medicine, combining the design and problem solving skills of engineering with medical biological sciences to advance health care treatment, including diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy.    Biomedical engineering has only recently emerged as its own study, as compared to many other engineering fields.   Such an evolution is common as a new field transitions from being an interdisciplinary specialization among already-established fields, to being considered a field in itself. 

Balkans<====>4829<====>Balkans    The Balkans, or the Balkan Peninsula, is a geographic area in southeastern Europe with various and disputed definitions.    The region takes its name from the Balkan Mountains that stretch from the Serbian-Bulgarian border to the Black Sea. The Balkan Peninsula is bordered by the Adriatic Sea on the northwest, the Ionian Sea on the southwest, the Aegean Sea in the south and southeast, and the Black Sea on the east and northeast.  The northern border of the peninsula is variously defined.  The highest point of the Balkans is Mount Musala   in the Rila mountain range. 

Bohr model<====>4831<====>Bohr model In atomic physics, the Rutherford–Bohr model or Bohr model or Bohr diagram, introduced by Niels Bohr and Ernest Rutherford in 1913, depicts the atom as a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons that travel in circular orbits around the nucleus—similar to structure of the Solar System, but with attraction provided by electrostatic forces rather than gravity.  After the cubic model (1902), the plum-pudding model (1904), the Saturnian model (1904), and the Rutherford model (1911) came the Rutherford–Bohr model or just Bohr model for short (1913).  The improvement to the Rutherford model is mostly a quantum physical interpretation of it. 

Bombay Sapphire<====>4832<====>Bombay Sapphire Bombay Sapphire is a brand of gin that was first launched in 1987 by IDV.  In 1997 Diageo sold the brand to Bacardi.   Its name originates from gin's popularity in India during the British Raj and the sapphire in question is the Star of Bombay on display at the Smithsonian Institution.  Bombay Sapphire  Bombay Sapphire is marketed in a flat-sided, sapphire-coloured bottle that bears a picture of Queen Victoria on the label.  The flavouring of the drink comes from a recipe of ten ingredients: almond, lemon peel, liquorice, juniper berries, orris root, angelica, coriander, cassia, cubeb, and grains of paradise. 

Bob Wills<====>4833<====>Bob Wills  James Robert Wills (March 6, 1905 – May 13, 1975) was an American Western swing musician, songwriter, and bandleader.  Considered by music authorities as the co-founder of Western swing, he was universally known as the King of Western Swing (although Spade Cooley self-promoted the moniker "King Of Western Swing" from 1942 to 1969). Wills formed several bands and played radio stations around the South and West until he formed the Texas Playboys in 1934 with Wills on fiddle, Tommy Duncan on piano and vocals, rhythm guitarist June Whalin, tenor banjoist Johnnie Lee Wills, and Kermit Whalin, who played steel guitar and bass. 

Badtrans<====>4834<====>BadtransBadTrans is a malicious Microsoft Windows computer worm distributed by e-mail.  Because of a known vulnerability in older versions of Internet Explorer, some e-mail programs, such as Microsoft's Outlook Express and Microsoft Outlook programs, may install and execute the worm as soon as the e-mail message is viewed. Once executed, the worm replicates by sending copies of itself to other e-mail addresses found on the host's machine, and installs a keystroke logger, which then captures everything typed on the affected computer.   Badtrans then transmits the data to one of several e-mail addresses.Among the e-mail addresses that received the keyloggers were free addresses at Excite, Yahoo, and IJustGotFired. 

Barış Manço<====>4836<====>Barış Manço   Mehmet Barış Manço (born Tosun Yusuf Mehmet Barış Manço;(2 January 1943 – 31 January 1999), known by his stage name Barış Manço, was a Turkish rock musician, singer, songwriter, composer, actor, television producer and show host.   Beginning his musical career while attending Galatasaray High School, he was a pioneer of rock music in Turkey and one of the founders of the Anatolian rock genre.  Manço composed around 200 songs and is among the best-selling and most awarded Turkish artists to date.  Many of his songs were translated into a variety of languages including English, French, Japanese, Greek, Italian, Bulgarian, Romanian, Persian, Hebrew, Urdu, Arabic, and German, among others. 

Blitz BASIC<====>4840<====>Blitz BASIC  Blitz BASIC refers to the programming language dialect that was interpreted by the first Blitz compilers, devised by New Zealand-based developer Mark Sibly.  Being derived from BASIC, Blitz syntax was designed to be easy to pick up for beginners first learning to program.   The languages are game-programming oriented but are often found general-purpose enough to be used for most types of application.  The Blitz language evolved as new products were released, with recent incarnations offering support for more advanced programming techniques such as object-orientation and multi-threading.   This led to the languages losing their BASIC moniker in later years. 

Bliss bibliographic classification<====>4842<====>Bliss bibliographic classificationThe Bliss bibliographic classification (BC) is a library classification system that was created by Henry E.  Bliss (1870–1955) and published in four volumes between 1940 and 1953.  Although originally devised in the United States, it was more commonly adopted by British libraries.  List of libraries using Bliss Classification.A second edition of the system (BC2) has been in ongoing development in Britain since 1977. Origins of the systemHenry E.  Bliss began working on the Bliss Classification system while working at the City College of New York Library as Assistant Librarian. 

Blood alcohol content<====>4845<====>Blood alcohol content Blood alcohol content (BAC), also called blood alcohol concentration, blood ethanol concentration, or blood alcohol level, is most commonly used as a metric of alcohol intoxication for legal or medical purposes. Blood alcohol concentration is usually expressed as a percentage of ethanol in the blood in units of mass of alcohol per volume of blood or mass of alcohol per mass of blood, depending on the country.  For instance, in North America a BAC of 0. 1 (0. 1% or one tenth of one percent) means that there are 0. 10 g of alcohol for every dL of blood. 

Barrister<====>4848<====>Barrister  A barrister (also known as barrister-at-law or bar-at-law) is a type of lawyer in common law jurisdictions.  Barristers mostly specialise in courtroom advocacy and litigation.  Their tasks include taking cases in superior courts and tribunals, drafting legal pleadings, researching the philosophy, hypothesis and history of law, and giving expert legal opinions.  Often, barristers are also recognised as legal scholars. Barristers are distinguished from solicitors, who have more direct access to clients, and may do transactional-type legal work.  It is mainly barristers who are appointed as judges, and they are rarely hired by clients directly. 

Battle of Gettysburg<====>4849<====>Battle of Gettysburg The Battle of Gettysburg ( , with an   sound)  was fought July 1–3, 1863, in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, by Union and Confederate forces during the American Civil War.  The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war  and is often described as the war's turning point.  Rawley, p.  147; Sauers, p.  827; Gallagher, Lee and His Army, p.  83; McPherson, p.  665; Eicher, p.  550.  Gallagher and McPherson cite the combination of Gettysburg and Vicksburg as the turning point. 

Budweiser<====>4851<====>Budweiser   Budweiser ( )  is an American-style pale lager produced by Anheuser-Busch, currently part of the transnational corporation Anheuser-Busch InBev.   Introduced in 1876 by Carl Conrad & Co.  of St.  Louis, Missouri,  it has grown to become one of the largest selling beers in the United States, and is available in over 80 markets worldwide though, due to a trademark dispute, not necessarily under the Budweiser name.  It is made with up to 30% rice in addition to hops and barley malt.  Protz, R. , The Complete Guide to World Beer (2004),    Produced in various breweries around the world, Budweiser is a filtered beer available in draft and packaged forms. 

Bermuda Triangle<====>4854<====>Bermuda TriangleThe Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil's Triangle, is a loosely-defined region in the western part of the North Atlantic Ocean, where a number of aircraft and ships are said to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances.  Most reputable sources dismiss the idea that there is any mystery.  The vicinity of the Bermuda Triangle is amongst the most heavily traveled shipping lanes in the world, with ships frequently crossing through it for ports in the Americas, Europe and the Caribbean islands.  Cruise ships and pleasure craft regularly sail through the region, and commercial and private aircraft routinely fly over it. 

Borough<====>4856<====>Borough  A borough is an administrative division in various English-speaking countries.  In principle, the term borough designates a self-governing walled town, although in practice, official use of the term varies widely. The word borough derives from common Proto-Germanic "*burgz", meaning "fort": compare with bury, burgh and brough (England), burgh (Scotland), Burg (Germany), borg (Scandinavia), burcht, burg (Dutch), boarch (West Frisian), and the Germanic borrowing present in neighbouring Indo-european languages such as borgo (Italian), bourg (French), burgo (Spanish and Portuguese), burg (Romanian), purg (Kajkavian) and durg (दर्ग) (Hindi) and arg (ارگ) (Persian).  The incidence of these words as suffixes to place names (for example, Aldeburgh, Bamburgh, Tilbury, Tilburg, Strasbourg (Strossburi in the local dialect), Luxembourg, Edinburgh, Grundisburgh, Hamburg, Gothenburg) usually indicates that they were once fortified settlements. 

Bodmin<====>4858<====>Bodmin    Bodmin (  ) is a civil parish and historic town in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom.  It is situated south-west of Bodmin Moor.  The extent of the civil parish corresponds fairly closely to that of the town so is mostly urban in character.  It is bordered to the east by Cardinham parish, to the southeast by Lanhydrock parish, to the southwest and west by Lanivet parish, and to the north by Helland parish.  Bodmin had a population of 14,736 as of the 2011 Census.    It was formerly the county town of Cornwall until the Crown Courts moved to Truro which is also the administrative centre (before 1835 the county town was Launceston). 

Bodmin Moor<====>4859<====>Bodmin Moor  Bodmin Moor ( )  is a granite moorland in northeastern Cornwall, England.  It is   in size, and dates from the Carboniferous period of geological history.  It includes Brown Willy, the highest point in Cornwall, and Rough Tor, a slightly lower peak.  Many of Cornwall's rivers have their sources here.  It has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic era, when primitive farmers started clearing trees and farming the land.  They left their megalithic monuments, hut circles and cairns, and the Bronze Age culture that followed left further cairns, and more stone circles and stone rows.

Bucket argument<====>4864<====>Bucket argumentIsaac Newton's rotating bucket argument (also known as Newton's bucket) was designed to demonstrate that true rotational motion cannot be defined as the relative rotation of the body with respect to the immediately surrounding bodies.   It is one of five arguments from the "properties, causes, and effects" of true motion and rest that support his contention that, in general, true motion and rest cannot be defined as special instances of motion or rest relative to other bodies, but instead can be defined only by reference to absolute space.  Alternatively, these experiments provide an operational definition of what is meant by "absolute rotation", and do not pretend to address the question of "rotation relative to what?"    General relativity dispenses with absolute space and with physics whose cause is external to the system, with the concept of geodesics of spacetime.

Brass instrument<====>4940<====>Brass instrument  A brass instrument is a musical instrument that produces sound by sympathetic vibration of air in a tubular resonator in sympathy with the vibration of the player's lips.  Brass instruments are also called labrosones, literally meaning "lip-vibrated instruments".  There are several factors involved in producing different pitches on a brass instrument.  Slides, valves, crooks (though they are rarely used today), or keys are used to change vibratory length of tubing, thus changing the available harmonic series, while the player's embouchure, lip tension and air flow serve to select the specific harmonic produced from the available series.

Bagpuss<====>4942<====>Bagpuss  Bagpuss is a British children's television series, made by Peter Firmin and Oliver Postgate.  The series of 13 episodes was first broadcast from 12 February 1974    to 7 May 1974 through their company Smallfilms.  The title character was "a saggy, old cloth cat, baggy, and a bit loose at the seams".Although only 13 episodes were made, it remains fondly remembered,    and was frequently repeated in the UK for 13 years.  In 1999 Bagpuss topped a BBC poll for the UK's favourite children's TV programme. 

Naive set theory<====>4944<====>Naive set theory Naïve set theory is one of several theories of sets used in the discussion of the foundations of mathematics.  Unlike axiomatic set theories, which are defined using formal logic, naïve set theory is defined informally, in natural language.  It describes the aspects of mathematical sets familiar in discrete mathematics (for example Venn diagrams and symbolic reasoning about their Boolean algebra), and suffices for the everyday use of set theory concepts in contemporary mathematics.  Sets are of great importance in mathematics; in modern formal treatments, most mathematical objects (numbers, relations, functions, etc. ) are defined in terms of sets. 

Murmured voice<====>4946<====>Murmured voice    Murmur (also called breathy voice, whispery voice, soughing and susurration) is a phonation in which the vocal folds vibrate, as they do in normal (modal) voicing, but are adjusted to let more air escape  which produces a sighing-like sound.  A simple murmured phonation,   (not actually a fricative consonant, as a literal reading of the IPA chart would suggest), can sometimes be heard as an allophone of English   between vowels, such as in the word behind, for some speakers. In the context of the Indo-Aryan languages like Sanskrit and Hindi and comparative Indo-European studies, murmured consonants are often called voiced aspirated, as in the Hindi and Sanskrit stops normally denoted bh, dh, ḍh, jh, and gh and the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European phoneme gʷʰ. 

Bézout's identity<====>4947<====>Bézout's identityBézout's identity (also called Bézout's lemma) is a theorem in elementary number theory: let a and b be nonzero integers and let d be their greatest common divisor.  Then there exist integers x and y such that  ax+by=d.   In addition,the greatest common divisor d is the smallest positive integer that can be written as  every integer of the form   is a multiple of the greatest common divisor d. The integers x and y are called Bézout coefficients for (a, b); they are not unique.  A pair of Bézout coefficients can be computed by the extended Euclidean algorithm. 

Banacek<====>4948<====>Banacek  Banacek (pronounced "BAN-a-check") is an American detective TV series starring George Peppard that aired on the NBC network from 1972 to 1974.  The series was part of the rotating NBC Wednesday Mystery Movie anthology.  It alternated in its time slot with several other shows, but was the only one of them to last beyond its first season. PremisePeppard played Thomas Banacek, a suave, Polish-American freelance investigator based in Boston, who solved seemingly impossible thefts (see locked room mystery).  He then collected from the insurance companies 10% of the insured value of the recovered property.  One of Banacek's verbal signatures was the quotation of strangely worded yet curiously cogent "Polish" proverbs such as:"If you're not sure that it's potato borscht, there could be orphans working in the mines.

The Blue Angels' six demonstration pilots currently fly the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, typically in more than 70 shows at 34 locations throughout the United States each year, where they still employ many of the same practices and techniques used in their aerial displays in their inaugural 1946 season. 

Born again<====>4950<====>Born again  In some Christian movements, particularly in Evangelicalism, to be born again is a popular phrase referring to "spiritual rebirth", or a regeneration of the human spirit from the Holy Spirit, contrasted with physical birth. In contemporary Christian usage, the term is distinct from sometimes similar terms used in mainstream Christianity to refer to being or becoming Christian, which is linked to baptism.  Individuals who profess to be "born again" often state that they have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. The phrase "born again" is also used as an adjective to describe individual members of the movement who espouse this belief, as well as the movement itself ("born-again Christian" and the "born-again movement"). 

Rockwell B-1 Lancer<====>4952<====>Rockwell B-1 Lancer The Rockwell B-1 Lancer The name "Lancer" is only applied to the B-1B version, after the program was revived.   is a supersonic variable-sweep wing, heavy bomber used by the United States Air Force (USAF).   It is commonly called the "Bone" (from "B-One").  It is one of three strategic bombers in the USAF fleet  , the other two being the B-2 Spirit "Stealth Bomber", and the B-52 Stratofortress. The B-1 was first envisioned in the 1960s as a platform that would combine the Mach 2 speed of the B-58 Hustler with the range and payload of the B-52, and would ultimately replace both bombers. 

Book of Common Prayer<====>4953<====>Book of Common Prayer    The Book of Common Prayer (BCP) is the short title of a number of related prayer books used in the Anglican Communion, as well as by the Continuing Anglican, "Anglican realignment" and other Anglican Christian churches.  The original book, published in 1549 in the reign of Edward VI, was a product of the English Reformation following the break with Rome.  Prayer books, unlike books of prayers, contain the words of structured (or liturgical) services of worship.  The work of 1549 was the first prayer book to include the complete forms of service for daily and Sunday worship in English. 

Bokken<====>4955<====>Bokken  A bokken ( , bok(u), "wood", and ken, "sword") (or a bokutō  , as they are instead called in Japan) is a Japanese wooden sword used for training.

Brezhnev Doctrine<====>4988<====>Brezhnev DoctrineThe Brezhnev Doctrine was a Soviet foreign policy, first and most clearly outlined by Sergei Kovalev in a September 26, 1968 Pravda article entitled Sovereignty and the International Obligations of Socialist Countries.   Leonid Brezhnev reiterated it in a speech at the Fifth Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party on November 13, 1968,  which stated: When forces that are hostile to socialism try to turn the development of some socialist country towards capitalism, it becomes not only a problem of the country concerned, but a common problem and concern of all socialist countries. This doctrine was announced to retroactively justify the invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 that ended the Prague Spring, along with earlier Soviet military interventions, such as the invasion of Hungary in 1956.

This climactic battle of the First Italo-Ethiopian War, was a decisive defeat for Italy and secured Ethiopian sovereignty. As the 20th century approached, Africa had been carved up among the European powers at the Berlin Conference.  The two independent exceptions were the  Republic of Liberia on the west coast and Ethiopia, or then still commonly known as Abyssinia, in the eastern Horn of Africa region. 

Bistability<====>5014<====>Bistability  In a dynamical system, bistability means the system has two stable equilibrium states.   Something that is bistable can be resting in either of two states.  These rest states need not be symmetric with respect to stored energy.   In terms of potential energy, a bistable system has two local minima of potential energy separated by a peak (local maximum).  An example of a mechanical device which is bistable is a light switch.  The switch lever is designed to rest in the "on" or "off" position, but not between the two. In a conservative force field, bistability stems from the fact that the potential energy has three equilibrium points.

Berry paradox<====>5036<====>Berry paradoxThe Berry paradox is a self-referential paradox arising from an expression like "the smallest positive integer not definable in fewer than twelve words" (note that this defining phrase has eleven words).  Bertrand Russell, the first to discuss the paradox in print, attributed it to G.  G.  Berry (1867–1928),  a junior librarian at Oxford's Bodleian library. OverviewConsider the expression:"The smallest positive integer not definable in under sixty letters. "Since there are only twenty-six letters in English alphabet, there are finitely many phrases of under sixty letters, and hence finitely many positive integers that are defined by phrases of under sixty letters.

Biathlon World Championships<====>5039<====>Biathlon World Championships    The first Biathlon World Championships (BWCH) was held in 1958, with individual and team contests for men.  The number of events has grown significantly over the years.  Beginning in 1984, women biathletes had their own World Championships, and finally, from 1989, both genders have been participating in joint BWCHs.  In 1978 the development was enhanced by the change from the large army rifle calibre to a small bore rifle, while the range to the target was reduced from 150 to 50 meters. BWCH venuesThe season's BWCHs takes place during February or March. 

Inedia<====>5040<====>Inedia Inedia (Latin for "fasting") or breatharianism   is the belief that it is possible for a person to live without consuming food.  Breatharians claim that food, and in some cases water, are not necessary for survival, and that humans can be sustained solely by prana, the vital life force in Hinduism.  According to Ayurveda, sunlight is one of the main sources of prana, and some practitioners believe that it is possible for a person to survive on sunlight alone.  The terms breatharianism or inedia may also refer to this philosophy when it is practiced as a lifestyle in place of the usual diet. 

Belfast<====>5046<====>Belfast Belfast (  or  ;  )  is the capital and largest city of Northern Ireland, and the second largest on the island of Ireland.   On the River Lagan, it had a population of 333,871 in 2015.  By the early 1800s the former town was home to a major port.  Belfast played a key role in the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, becoming the biggest linen producer in the world, earning it the nickname "Linenopolis".  By the time it was granted city status in 1888, it was a major centre of the Irish linen as well as tobacco-processing, rope-making and shipbuilding industries. 

Biotite<====>5047<====>Biotite Biotite is a common phyllosilicate mineral within the mica group, with the approximate chemical formula  .  More generally, it refers to the dark mica series, primarily a solid-solution series between the iron-endmember annite,  and the magnesium-endmember phlogopite; more aluminous end-members include siderophyllite.  Biotite was named by J. F. L.  Hausmann in 1847 in honor of the French physicist Jean-Baptiste Biot, who performed early research into the many optical properties of mica.  Biotite is a sheet silicate.  Iron, magnesium, aluminium, silicon, oxygen, and hydrogen form sheets that are weakly bound together by potassium ions. 

Brigham Young<====>5048<====>Brigham Young   Brigham Young ( ; June 1, 1801 August 29, 1877) was an American leader in the Latter Day Saint movement, politician, and a settler in the Western United States.  He was the second president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1847 until his death in 1877.  He founded Salt Lake City and he served as the first governor of the Utah Territory.  Young also led the foundings of the precursors to the University of Utah and Brigham Young University. Young had many nicknames, among the most popular being "American Moses"  (alternatively, the "Modern Moses" or "Mormon Moses"),   because, like the biblical figure, Young led his followers, the Mormon pioneers, in an exodus through a desert, to what they saw as a promised land. 

Burns supper<====>5049<====>Burns supperA Burns supper is a celebration of the life and poetry of the poet Robert Burns, the author of many Scots poems.  The suppers are normally held on or near the poet's birthday, 25 January, occasionally  known as Robert Burns Day (or Robbie Burns Day  or Rabbie Burns Day) but more commonly known as Burns Night ( ).  However, in principle, celebrations may be held at any other time of the year. HistoryThe first supper was held in memoriam at Burns Cottage by Burns's friends, on 21 July 1801, the fifth anniversary of his death; it has been a regular occurrence ever since.

Chordate<====>5131<====>Chordate   A chordate is an animal belonging to the phylum Chordata; chordates possess a notochord, a hollow dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, an endostyle, and a post-anal tail, for at least some period of their life cycle.  Chordates are deuterostomes, as during the embryo development stage the anus forms before the mouth.  They are also bilaterally symmetric coelomates with metameric segmentation and a circulatory system.  In the case of vertebrate chordates, the notochord is usually replaced by a vertebral column during development. Taxonomically, the phylum includes the following subphyla: the Vertebrata, which includes fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals; the Tunicata, which includes salps and sea squirts; and the Cephalochordata, which include the lancelets.

Chaplin became a worldwide icon through his screen persona "the Tramp" and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry.   His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy. Chaplin's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship. 

The World Factbook<====>5163<====>The World Factbook  The World Factbook ( ; also known as the CIA World Factbook)    is a reference resource produced by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) with almanac-style information about the countries of the world.  The official print version is available from the National Technical Information Service and the Government Printing Office.  Other companies—such as Skyhorse Publishing—also print a paper edition.  The Factbook is available in the form of a website that is partially updated every week.  It is also available for download for use off-line.  It provides a two- to three-page summary of the demographics, geography, communications, government, economy, and military of each of 267 international entities    including U. 

Country<====>5165<====>Country A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography.  A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics.  Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise  of legal jurisdiction. 

Copenhagen<====>5166<====>CopenhagenCopenhagen  (   ;   ) is the capital and most populous city of Denmark.  The city has a population of 763,908 ( ), of whom 601,448 live in the Municipality of Copenhagen.https://www. dst. dk/en/Statistik/emner/befolkning-og-befolkningsfremskrivning  The larger urban area has a population of approximately 1. 3 million ( ),  while the Copenhagen metropolitan area has just over 2 million inhabitants.

Combinatorics<====>5170<====>Combinatorics Combinatorics is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with counting, both as a means and an end in obtaining results, and certain properties of finite structures.   It is closely related to many other areas of mathematics and has many applications ranging from logic to statistical physics, from evolutionary biology to computer science, etc.   To fully understand the scope of combinatorics requires a great deal of further amplification, the details of which are not universally agreed upon.   According to H.  J.  Ryser, a definition of the subject is difficult because it crosses so many mathematical subdivisions. 

Calculus<====>5176<====>Calculus    Calculus (from Latin calculus, literally 'small pebble', used for counting and calculations, like on an abacus)    is the mathematical study of  continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations.  It has two major branches, differential calculus (concerning rates of change and slopes of curves),  and integral calculus (concerning accumulation of quantities and the areas under and between curves).   These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus.  Both branches make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit. 

Communication<====>5177<====>Communication  Communication (from Latin commūnicāre, meaning "to share" ) is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules. The main steps inherent to all communication are:  The formation of communicative motivation or reason. Message composition (further internal or technical elaboration on what exactly to express). Message encoding (for example, into digital data, written text, speech, pictures, gestures and so on). Transmission of the encoded message as a sequence of signals using a specific channel or medium. Noise sources such as natural forces and in some cases human activity (both intentional and accidental) begin influencing the quality of signals propagating from the sender to one or more receivers. 

Classics<====>5178<====>Classics   Classics or classical studies is the study of classical antiquity.  It encompasses the study of the Greco-Roman world, particularly of its languages and literature (Ancient Greek and Classical Latin) but also of Greco-Roman philosophy, history, and archaeology.  Traditionally in the West, the study of the Greek and Roman classics was considered one of the cornerstones of the humanities and a necessary part of a rounded education.  The study of Classics has been traditionally a cornerstone of a typical elite education. Study encompasses specifically a time-period of history from the mid-2nd millennia BC to the 6th century AD. 

Chemistry<====>5180<====>Chemistry    Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with compounds composed of atoms, i. e.  elements, and molecules, i. e.  combinations of atoms: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other compounds.    Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds.  There are four types of chemical bonds: covalent bonds, in which compounds share one or more electron(s); ionic bonds, in which a compound donates one or more electrons to another compound to produce ions: cations and anions; hydrogen bonds; and Van der Waals force bonds. 

Cytoplasm<====>5184<====>Cytoplasm  In cell biology, the cytoplasm is the material  within a living cell, excluding the cell nucleus.  It comprises cytosol (the gel-like substance enclosed within the cell membrane) and the organelles – the cell's internal sub-structures.  All of the contents of the cells of prokaryotic organisms (such as bacteria, which lack a cell nucleus) are contained within the cytoplasm.   Within the cells of eukaryotic organisms the contents of the cell nucleus are separated from the cytoplasm, and are then called the nucleoplasm.  The cytoplasm is about 80% water and usually colorless.  The submicroscopic ground cell substance or cytoplasmatic matrix which remains after exclusion the cell organelles and particles is groundplasm. 

Christ (title)<====>5185<====>Christ (title)   In Christianity, the Christ  (Greek Χριστός, Christós, meaning "the anointed one") is a title for the saviour and redeemer who would bring salvation to the Jewish people and mankind.  Christians believe that Jesus is the Jewish messiah called Christ in both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament.  Christ, used by Christians as both a name and a title, is synonymous with Jesus.   The role of the Christ in Christianity originated from the concept of the messiah in Judaism.  Though the conceptions of the messiah in each religion are similar, for the most part they are distinct from one another due to the split of early Christianity and Judaism in the 1st century. 

Central Europe<====>5188<====>Central Europe  Central Europe is the region comprising the central part of Europe.  It is said to occupy continuous territory that are otherwise conventionally Eastern Europe and Western Europe.  The concept of Central Europe is based on a common historical, social and cultural identity.    Central Europe is going through a phase of "strategic awakening",  with initiatives such as the CEI, Centrope and the Visegrád Four. 

Geography of Canada<====>5192<====>Geography of Canada The geography of Canada describes the geographic features of Canada, the world's second largest country in total area. Situated in northern North America (constituting 41% of the continent's area), Canada spans a vast, diverse territory between the North Pacific Ocean to the west and the North Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Arctic Ocean to the north (hence the country's motto "From sea to sea"), with the United States to the south (contiguous United States) and northwest (Alaska).   Greenland is to the northeast; off the southern coast of Newfoundland lies Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, an overseas collectivity of France.

Politics of Canada<====>5194<====>Politics of Canada  The politics of Canada function within a framework of parliamentary democracy and a federal system of parliamentary government with strong democratic traditions.  Canada is a constitutional monarchy, in which the Monarch is head of state.  The country has a multi-party system in which many of its legislative practices derive from the unwritten conventions of and precedents set by the Westminster Parliament of the United Kingdom.  However, Canada has evolved variations: party discipline in Canada is stronger than in the United Kingdom and more parliamentary votes are considered motions of confidence, which tends to diminish the role of non-Cabinet Members of Parliament, (MPs). 

Economy of Canada<====>5195<====>Economy of Canada The economy of Canada is a highly developed mixed economy with 10th largest GDP by nominal and 17th largest GDP by PPP in the world.  As with other developed nations, the country's economy is dominated by the service industry, which employs about three quarters of Canadians.   Canada has the fourth highest total estimated value of natural resources, valued at US$33. 2 trillion in 2016.   It has the world's third largest proven petroleum reserves and is the fourth largest exporter of petroleum.  It is also the fourth largest exporter of natural gas. 

Telecommunications in Canada<====>5196<====>Telecommunications in Canada Present-day Telecommunications in Canada include telephone, radio, television, and internet usage.  In the past, telecommunications included telegraphy available through Canadian Pacific and Canadian National.  HistoryFixed-line telephony Telephones - fixed lines: total subscriptions: 14,987,520 (July 2016 est. )Subscriptions per 100 inhabitants: 42Telephones - mobile cellular:  30. 45 million (July 2016 est. )Subscriptions per 100 inhabitants: 86Telephone system: (2016)Domestic: comparatively low mobile penetration provides further room for growth; domestic satellite system with about 300 earth stationsInternational: country code - +1; submarine cables provide links within the Americas and Europe; satellite earth stations - 7 (5 Intelsat - 4 trans-Atlantic Ocean and 1 trans-Pacific Ocean, and 2 Intersputnik - (Atlantic Ocean region)Telegraphy  The history of telegraphy in Canada dates back to the Province of Canada. 

Transportation in Canada<====>5197<====>Transportation in Canada Transportation in Canada, the world's second-largest country in total area, is dedicated to having an efficient, high-capacity multimodal transport spanning often vast distances between natural resource extraction sites, agricultural and urban areas.  Canada's transportation system includes more than   of roads, 10 major international airports, 300 smaller airports,   of functioning railway track, and more than 300 commercial ports and harbours that provide access to the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic oceans as well as the Great Lakes and the St.  Lawrence Seaway.   In 2005, the transportation sector made up 4. 2% of Canada's GDP, compared to 3. 

Canada–United States relations<====>5199<====>Canada–United States relations  Relations between Canada and the United States of America historically have been extensive, given a shared border and ever-increasingclose cultural, economical ties and similarities.    The shared historical and cultural heritage has resulted in one of the most stable and mutually beneficial international relationships in the world.  For both countries, the level of trade with the other is at the top of the annual combined import-export total.  Tourism and migration between the two nations have increased rapport, but border security was heightened after the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001. 

Christianity<====>5211<====>Christianity    Christianity From Ancient Greek   Khristós (Latinized as Christus), translating Hebrew מָשִׁיחַ, Māšîăḥ, meaning "the anointed one", with the Latin suffixes -ian and -itas.   is an Abrahamic monotheistic  religion based on the life, teachings, and miracles  of Jesus Christ, who is the focal point of the Christian faiths.  It is the world's largest religion,with over 2. 4 billion followers, 33. 39% of ~7. 2 billion world population (under the section 'People')or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. 

Computing<====>5213<====>Computing   Computing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating a mathematical sequence of steps known as an algorithm — e. g.  through computers.  Computing includes designing, developing and building hardware and software systems; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific research on and with computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; and creating and using communications and entertainment media.  The field of computing includes computer engineering, software engineering, computer science, information systems, and information technology. DefinitionsThe ACM Computing Curricula 2005    defined "computing" as follows: "In a general way, we can define computing to mean any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating computers. 

Casino<====>5215<====>Casino  A casino is a facility which houses and accommodates certain types of gambling activities.  The industry that deals in casinos is called the gaming industry.  Casinos are most commonly built near or combined with hotels, restaurants, retail shopping, cruise ships or other tourist attractions.  There is much debate over whether the social and economic consequences of casino gambling outweigh the initial revenue that may be generated.   Some casinos are also known for hosting live entertainment events, such as stand-up comedy, concerts, and sporting events. Etymology and usageThe term "casino" is a confusing linguistic false friend for translators. 

Khmer language<====>5216<====>Khmer language    Khmer    or Cambodian (natively    , or more formally    ) is the language of the Khmer people and the official language of Cambodia.  With approximately 16 million speakers, it is the second most widely spoken Austroasiatic language (after Vietnamese).  Khmer has been influenced considerably by Sanskrit and Pali, especially in the royal and religious registers, through Hinduism and Buddhism.  The more colloquial registers have influenced, and have been influenced by, Thai, Lao, Vietnamese, and Cham, all of which, due to geographical proximity and long-term cultural contact, form a sprachbund in peninsular Southeast Asia. 

Central processing unit<====>5218<====>Central processing unit    A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.  The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s.Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.    The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operation remains almost unchanged. 

Carnivora<====>5221<====>Carnivora   Carnivora ( ;   from Latin carō (stem carn-) "flesh" and vorāre "to devour") is a diverse scrotiferan order that includes over 280 species of placental mammals.  Its members are formally referred to as carnivorans, whereas the word "carnivore" (often popularly applied to members of this group) can refer to any meat-eating organism.  Carnivorans are the most diverse in size of any mammalian order, ranging from the least weasel (Mustela nivalis), at as little as   and  , to the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which can weigh up to  , to the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina), whose adult males weigh up to   and measure up to   in length. 

Colombia<====>5222<====>Colombia  Colombia (    or    ;  ), officially the Republic of Colombia ( ),  is a sovereign state largely situated in the northwest of South America, with territories in Central America.  Colombia shares a border to the northwest with Panama, to the east with Venezuela and Brazil and to the south with Ecuador and Peru.   It shares its maritime limits with Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Jamaica, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.   It is a unitary, constitutional republic comprising thirty-two departments.  The territory of what is now Colombia was originally inhabited by indigenous peoples, including the Muisca, Quimbaya and the Tairona. 

Citizen Kane<====>5224<====>Citizen Kane   Citizen Kane is a 1941 American mystery drama film by Orson Welles, its producer, co-screenwriter, director and star.  The picture was Welles's first feature film.  Nominated for Academy Awards in nine categories, it won an Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by Herman J.  Mankiewicz and Welles.  Considered by many critics, filmmakers, and fans to be the greatest film of all time, Citizen Kane was voted as such in five consecutive British Film Institute Sight & Sound polls of critics, until it was displaced by Vertigo in the 2012 poll.  It topped the American Film Institute's  100 Years . 

Code<====>5225<====>Code    In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form or representation, sometimes shortened or secret, for communication through a channel or storage in a medium.  An early example is the invention of language which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what he or she saw, heard, felt, or thought to others.  But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry, and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered.  The invention of writing, which converted spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication across space and time. 

Cheirogaleidae<====>5228<====>Cheirogaleidae The Cheirogaleidae are the family of strepsirrhine primates containing the various dwarf and mouse lemurs.  Like all other lemurs, cheirogaleids live exclusively on the island of Madagascar. CharacteristicsCheirogaleids are smaller than the other lemurs and, in fact, they are the smallest primates.  They have soft, long fur, colored grey-brown to reddish on top, with a generally brighter underbelly.  Typically, they have small ears, large, close-set eyes, and long hind legs.  Like all strepsirrhines, they have fine claws at the second toe of the hind legs.  They grow to a size of only 13 to 28 cm, with a tail that is very long, sometimes up to one and a half times as long as the body. 

Callitrichidae<====>5229<====>Callitrichidae The Callitrichidae (also called Arctopitheci or Hapalidae) are a family of New World monkeys, including marmosets, tamarins and lion tamarins.  At times, this group of animals has been regarded as a subfamily, called Callitrichinae, of the family Cebidae. This taxon was traditionally thought to be a primitive lineage, from which all the larger-bodied platyrrhines evolved.   However, some works argue that callitrichids are actually a dwarfed lineage.Naish, Darren.  Marmosets and tamarins: dwarfed monkeys of the South American tropics.  Scientific American November 27, 2012 Ancestral stem-callitrichids likely were "normal-sized" ceboids that were dwarfed through evolutionary time. 

Cebidae<====>5230<====>Cebidae The Cebidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised.  Extant members are the capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys.   These species are found throughout tropical and subtropical South and Central America. CharacteristicsCebid monkeys are arboreal animals that only rarely travel on the ground.  They are generally small monkeys, ranging in size   up to that of the brown capuchin, with a body length of 33 to 56 cm, and a weight of 2. 5 to 3. 9 kilograms.  They are somewhat variable in form and coloration, but all have the wide, flat, noses typical of New World monkeys. 

Chondrichthyes<====>5232<====>Chondrichthyes  Chondrichthyes ( ; from Greek χονδρ- chondr- 'cartilage', ἰχθύς ichthys 'fish') is a class that contains the cartilaginous fishes: they are jawed vertebrates with paired fins, paired nares, scales, a heart with its chambers in series, and skeletons made of cartilage rather than bone.  The class is divided into two subclasses: Elasmobranchii (sharks, rays, skates, and sawfish) and Holocephali (chimaeras, sometimes called ghost sharks, which are sometimes separated into their own class). Within the infraphylum Gnathostomata, cartilaginous fishes are distinct from all other jawed vertebrates. Anatomy SkeletonThe skeleton is cartilaginous.  The notochord, which is present in the young, is gradually replaced by cartilage. 

Carl Linnaeus<====>5233<====>Carl LinnaeusCarl Linnaeus ( ;   23 May  1707 – 10 January 1778), also known after his ennoblement as Carl von Linné Blunt (2004), p.  171.   ( ), was a Swedish botanist, physician, and zoologist, who formalised the modern system of naming organisms called binomial nomenclature.  He is known by the epithet "father of modern taxonomy".Many of his writings were in Latin, and his name is rendered in Latin as   (after 1761 Carolus a Linné). Linnaeus was born in the countryside of Småland, in southern Sweden. 

Coast<====>5236<====>Coast   A coastline or a seashore is the area where land meets the sea or ocean,  or  a line that forms the boundary between the land and the ocean or a lake.A precise line that can be called a coastline cannot be determined due to the Coastline paradox. The term coastal zone is a region where interaction of the sea and land processes occurs.   Both the terms coast and coastal are often used to describe a geographic location or region; for example, New Zealand's West Coast, or the East and West Coasts of the United States. 

Catatonia<====>5237<====>Catatonia    Catatonia is a state of psycho-motor immobility and behavioral abnormality manifested by stupor.  It was first described in 1874 by Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum, in    (Catatonia or Tension Insanity). Though catatonia has historically been related to schizophrenia (catatonic schizophrenia), it is now known that catatonic symptoms are nonspecific and may be observed in other mental disorders and neurological conditions.  In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), catatonia is not recognized as a separate disorder, but is associated with psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia (catatonic type), bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and other mental disorders, narcolepsy, as well as drug abuse or overdose (or both). 

Cipher<====>5244<====>Cipher  In cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption—a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure.  An alternative, less common term is encipherment.  To encipher or encode is to convert information into cipher or code.  In common parlance, "cipher" is synonymous with "code", as they are both a set of steps that encrypt a message; however, the concepts are distinct in cryptography, especially classical cryptography. Codes generally substitute different length strings of characters in the output, while ciphers generally substitute the same number of characters as are input. 

Country music<====>5247<====>Country music  Country (or country and western) is a musical genre that originated in the southern United States in the  early 1920s.It takes its roots from genres such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music) and blues. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms, folk lyric and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, steel guitars (such as pedal steels and dobros), and fiddles as well as harmonicas.    Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. 

Cold War (1947–1953)<====>5248<====>Cold War (1947–1953) The Cold War (1947–1953) is the period within the Cold War from the Truman Doctrine in 1947 to the conclusion of the Korean War in 1953.  The Cold War emerged in Europe a few years after the successful US-USSR-UK coalition won World War II in Europe, and extended to 1989-91.  Some conflicts between the West and the USSR appeared earlier.  In 1945-46 the US and UK strongly protested Soviet political takeover efforts in Eastern Europe, while the hunt for Soviet spies made the tensions more visible.   However historians emphasize the decisive break between the US-UK and the USSR came in 1947-48 over such issues as the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan and the Berlin Blockade, followed by the formation of NATO in 1949. 

Crony capitalism<====>5249<====>Crony capitalism Crony capitalism is an economy in which businesses thrive not as a result of risk taken for them, but rather, as a return on money amassed through a nexus between a business class and the political class.  This is done using state power to crush genuine competition in handing out permits, government grants, special tax breaks, or other forms of state interventionover resources where the state exercises monopolist control over public goods, for example, mining concessions for primary commodities or contracts for public works.  Money is then made not merely by making a profit  in the market, but by profiteering by 'rent seeking' using this monopoly or oligopoly.

Constitution<====>5253<====>Constitution   A constitution is a set of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is governed.   These rules together make up, i. e.  constitute, what the entity is.  When these principles are written down into a single document or set of legal documents, those documents may be said to embody a written constitution; if they are written down in a single comprehensive document, it is said to embody a codified constitution.  Some constitutions (such as the constitution of the United Kingdom) are uncodified, but written in numerous fundamental Acts of a legislature, court cases or treaties. 

Common law<====>5254<====>Common law   Common law  (also known as judicial precedent or judge-made law, or case law) is that body of law derived from judicial decisions of courts and similar tribunals. Washington Probate, "Estate Planning & Probate Glossary", Washington (State) Probate, s. v.  "common", 8 Dec.  2008:, retrieved 7 November 2009. "1.  A law based on a prior court decision"    The defining characteristic of “common law” is that it arises as precedent.   In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts, and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts. 

Common descent<====>5259<====>Common descent   Common descent describes how, in evolutionary biology, a group of organisms share a most recent common ancestor.  There is "massive"  evidence of common descent of all life on Earth from the last universal common ancestor (LUCA).   In July 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the LUCA, by comparing the genomes of the three domains of life, archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes.    Common ancestry between organisms of different species arises during speciation, in which new species are established from a single ancestral population. 

Celtic music<====>5261<====>Celtic music   Celtic music is a broad grouping of music genres that evolved out of the folk music traditions of the Celtic people of Western Europe.   It refers to both orally-transmitted traditional music and recorded music and the styles vary considerably to include everything from "trad" (traditional) music to a wide range of hybrids. Description and definitionCeltic music means two things mainly.  First, it is the music of the people that identify themselves as Celts.  Secondly, it refers to whatever qualities may be unique to the music of the Celtic Nations. 

Constellation<====>5267<====>ConstellationTop: Baroque drawing of the constellation Orion from Johannes Hevelius  Celestial catalogueBottom: Contemporary map of Orion from the IAU and photography of the night sky A constellation is a group of stars that are considered to form imaginary outlines or meaningful patterns on the celestial sphere, typically representing animals, mythological people or gods, mythological creatures, or manufactured devices. The 88 modern constellations are formally defined regions of the sky together covering the entire celestial sphere.    Origins for the earliest constellations likely goes back to prehistory, whose now unknown creators collectively used them to related important stories of either their beliefs, experiences, creation or mythology. 

Printer (computing)<====>5272<====>Printer (computing)  In computing, a printer is a peripheral device which makes a persistent human-readable representation of graphics or text on paper.   The first computer printer design was a mechanically driven apparatus by Charles Babbage for his difference engine in the 19th century; his mechanical printer design was not built until 2000.   The first electronic printer was the EP-101, invented by Japanese company Epson and released in 1968.    The first commercial printers generally used mechanisms from electric typewriters and Teletype machines.  The demand for higher speed led to the development of new systems specifically for computer use. 

Copyright<====>5278<====>Copyright  Copyright is a legal right created by the law of a country that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights for its use and distribution.  This is usually only for a limited time.  The exclusive rights are not absolute but limited by limitations and exceptions to copyright law, including fair use.  A major limitation on copyright is that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the underlying ideas themselves.   Copyright is a form of intellectual property, applicable to certain forms of creative work. 

Catalan language<====>5282<====>Catalan languageCatalan ( ; Laurie Bauer, 2007, The Linguistics Student's Handbook, Edinburgh  autonym: català    ) is a Romance language derived from Vulgar Latin (i. e.  the spoken language of the people in common use) and named after the medieval Principality of Catalonia, in northeastern modern Spain.  It is the only official language of Andorra,  and a co-official language of the Spanish autonomous communities of Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and Valencia (where the language is known as Valencian).  It also has semi-official status in the Italian commune of Alghero. 

STS-51-F<====>5285<====>STS-51-F  STS-51-F (also known as Spacelab 2) was the nineteenth flight of NASA's Space Shuttle program and the eighth flight of Space Shuttle Challenger.  It launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on July 29, 1985, and landed just under eight days later on August 6. While STS-51-F's primary payload was the Spacelab 2 laboratory module, the payload that received the most publicity was the Carbonated Beverage Dispenser Evaluation, which was an experiment in which both Coca-Cola and Pepsi tried to make their carbonated drinks available to astronauts.   A helium-cooled infrared telescope (IRT) was also flown on this mission, and while it did have some problems, it observed 60% of the galactic plane. 

Classical period (music)<====>5288<====>Classical period (music)   The dates of the Classical period in Western music are generally accepted as being between about the year 1730 and the year 1820.  However, the term classical music is often used in a colloquial sense as a synonym for Western art music which describes a variety of Western musical styles from the Middle Ages to the present, and especially from the seventeenth century to the nineteenth.  This article is about the specific period in most of the 18th century to the early 19th century, though overlapping with the Baroque and Romantic periods.  The Classical period falls between the Baroque and the Romantic periods. 

Character encoding<====>5295<====>Character encodingIn computing character encoding is used to represent a repertoire of characters by some kind of encoding system.   Depending on the abstraction level and context, corresponding code points and the resulting code space may be regarded as bit patterns, octets, natural numbers, electrical pulses, etc.  A character encoding is used in computation, data storage, and transmission of textual data.  "Character set", "character map", "codeset" and "code page" are related, but not identical, terms. Early character codes associated with the optical or electrical telegraph could only represent a subset of the characters used in written languages, sometimes restricted to upper case letters, numerals and some punctuation only. 

Control character<====>5298<====>Control character  In computing and telecommunication, a control character or non-printing character is a code point (a number) in a character set, that does not represent a written symbol.  They are used as in-band signaling to cause effects other than the addition of a symbol to the text.  All other characters are mainly printing, printable, or graphic characters, except perhaps for the "space" character (see ASCII printable characters). All entries in the ASCII table below code 32 (technically the C0 control code set) are of this kind, including CR and LF used to separate lines of text. 

Carbon<====>5299<====>CarbonCarbon (from   "coal") is a chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6.  It is nonmetallic and tetravalent—making four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. It belongs to group 14 of periodic table .  Three isotopes occur naturally,  C and  C being stable, while  C is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years.Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.    Carbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. 

Computer data storage<====>5300<====>Computer data storage  Computer data storage, often called storage or memory, is a technology consisting of computer components and recording media that are used to retain digital data.  It is a core function and fundamental component of computers.The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates data by performing computations.   In practice, almost all computers use a storage hierarchy,   which puts fast but expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and slower but larger and cheaper options farther away.  Generally the fast volatile technologies (which lose data when off power) are referred to as "memory", while slower persistent technologies are referred to as "storage". 

Chemical equilibrium<====>5306<====>Chemical equilibrium In a chemical reaction, chemical equilibrium is the state in which both reactants and products are present in concentrations which have no further tendency to change with time.Usually, this state results when the forward reaction proceeds at the same rate as the reverse reaction.  The reaction rates of the forward and backward reactions are generally not zero, but equal.  Thus, there are no net changes in the concentrations of the reactant(s) and product(s).  Such a state is known as dynamic equilibrium.   Historical introductionThe concept of chemical equilibrium was developed after Berthollet (1803) found that some chemical reactions are reversible. 

Combination<====>5308<====>Combination   In mathematics, a combination is a selection of items from a collection, such that (unlike permutations) the order of selection does not matter.  For example, given three fruits, say an apple, an orange and a pear, there are three combinations of two that can be drawn from this set: an apple and a pear; an apple and an orange; or a pear and an orange. More formally, a k-combination of a set S is a subset of k distinct elements of S.  If the set has n elements, the number of k-combinations is equal to the binomial coefficient  \binom nk = \frac{n(n-1)\dotsb(n-k+1)}{k(k-1)\dotsb1}, which can be written using factorials as  \textstyle\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}  whenever  k\leq n , and which is zero when  k>n . 

Software<====>5309<====>Software  Computer software, or simply software, is a part of a computer system that consists of data or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built.  In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, programs and data.  Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media.  Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own. At the lowest level, executable code consists of machine language instructions specific to an individual processor—typically a central processing unit (CPU). 

Personal computer hardware<====>5310<====>Personal computer hardware

Computer programming<====>5311<====>Computer programming Computer programming (often shortened to programming) is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs.  Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding  ) of algorithms in a target programming language.  Source code is written in one or more programming languages.  The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific task or solving a given problem.  The process of programming thus often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic. 

The Consolation of Philosophy<====>5312<====>The Consolation of Philosophy   The Consolation of Philosophy ( ) is a philosophical work by Boethius, written around the year 524.  It has been described as the single most important and influential work in the West on Medieval and early Renaissance Christianity, as well as the last great Western work of the Classical Period.   Dante placed Boethius the “last of the Romans and first of the Scholastics” among the doctors in his Paradise (see The Divine Comedy) (see also below).  Description The Consolation of Philosophy was written in AD 523 during a one-year imprisonment Boethius served while awaiting trial – and eventual execution – for the alleged crime of treason under the Ostrogothic King Theodoric the Great. 

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon<====>5313<====>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon    Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon ( ) is a 2000 martial arts film.  The film is a Chinese, Taiwanese, Hong Kong and American venture  produced by Asian Union Film & Entertainment, China Film Co-Productions Corporation, Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia, Edko Films, Good Machine International, and Zoom Hunt Productions.  Directed by Ang Lee and featuring an international cast of Chinese actors, including Chow Yun-fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi and Chang Chen, the film was released in 2000.  It was based on the fourth novel, of the same name, in the wuxia book series Crane Iron Pentalogy, by Chinese novelist Wang Dulu. 

Charlemagne<====>5314<====>Charlemagne  Charlemagne ( ) or Charles the Great  (2 April 742   – 28 January 814), numbered Charles I, was King of the Franks from 768, King of the Lombards from 774 and Emperor of the Romans from 800.  He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages.  He was the first recognised emperor in western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier.   The expanded Frankish state that Charlemagne founded is called the Carolingian Empire. Charlemagne was the eldest son of Pepin the Short and Bertrada of Laon, having been born before their canonical marriage. 

Character encodings in HTML<====>5315<====>Character encodings in HTML   HTML ( H yper t ext  M arkup  L anguage) has been in use since 1991, but HTML 4. 0 (December 1997) was the first standardized version where international characters were given reasonably complete treatment.  When an HTML document includes special characters outside the range of seven-bit ASCII two goals are worth considering: the information's integrity, and universal browser display. Specifying the document's character encodingThere are several ways to specify which character encoding is used in the document.  First, the web server can include the character encoding or " charset " in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)  Content-Type  header, which would typically look like this: Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-4This method gives the HTTP server a convenient way to alter document's encoding according to content negotiation; certain HTTP server software can do it, for example Apache with the module  mod_charset_lite . 

Carbon nanotube<====>5320<====>Carbon nanotube   Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are allotropes of carbon with a cylindrical nanostructure.  These cylindrical carbon molecules have unusual properties, which are valuable for nanotechnology, electronics, optics and other fields of materials science and technology.  Owing to the material's exceptional strength and stiffness, nanotubes have been constructed with length-to-diameter ratio of up to 132,000,000:1,    significantly larger than for any other material. In addition, owing to their extraordinary thermal conductivity, mechanical, and electrical properties, carbon nanotubes find applications as additives to various structural materials.

Czech Republic<====>5321<====>Czech Republic  The Czech Republic (    ,  ),  also known as Czechia  ( ;  ,  ), is a landlocked nation state in Central Europe bordered by Germany to the west, Austria to the south, Slovakia to the east and Poland to the northeast.   The Czech Republic covers an area of   with a mostly temperate continental climate and oceanic climate.  It is a unitary parliamentary republic, has Expression error: Unrecognised punctuation character: "{" million inhabitants and the capital and largest city is Prague, with over 1. 

Czechoslovakia<====>5322<====>Czechoslovakia   Czechoslovakia, or Czecho-Slovakia    ( ;   Czech and  , Česko-Slovensko    ), was a sovereign state in Central Europe that existed from October 1918, when it declared its independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, until its peaceful dissolution into the Czech Republic and Slovakia on 1 January 1993. From 1939 to 1945, following its forced division and partial incorporation into Nazi Germany, the state did not de facto exist but its government-in-exile continued to operate. From 1948 to 1990, Czechoslovakia was part of the Soviet bloc with a command economy.  Its economic status was formalized in membership of Comecon from 1949 and its defense status in the Warsaw Pact of May 1955. 

Computer science<====>5323<====>Computer scienceComputer science deals with the theoretical foundations of information and computation, together with practical techniques for the implementation and application of these foundations.    Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basics for the design and use of computers.  It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information.

Creationism<====>5326<====>Creationism   Creationism is the religious belief that the universe and life originated "from specific acts of divine creation", Gunn 2004, p.  9, "The Concise Oxford Dictionary says that creationism is 'the belief that the universe and living organisms originated from specific acts of divine creation. '"as opposed to the scientific conclusion that they came about through natural processes.The first use of the term "creationist"  to describe a proponent of creationism is found in an 1856 letter of Charles Darwin describing those who objected on religious grounds to the then emerging science of evolution. 

History of Chad<====>5329<====>History of Chad Chad ( ;  ), officially the Republic of Chad, is a landlocked country in West Africa.  It borders Libya to the north, Sudan to the east, the Central African Republic to the south, Cameroon and Nigeria to the southwest, and Niger to the west.  Due to its distance from the sea and its largely desert climate, the country is sometimes referred to as the "Dead Heart of Africa".  PrehistoryThe territory now known as Chad possesses some of the richest archaeological sites in Africa.A hominid skull was found by Michel Brunet in 2002, in Borkou, that is more than 7 million years old, the oldest discovered anywhere in the world; it has been given the name Sahelanthropus tchadensis. 

Geography of Chad<====>5330<====>Geography of ChadChad is one of the 48 land-locked countries in the world and is located in North Central Africa, measuring  , nearly twice the size of France and slightly more than three times the size of California.  Most of its ethnically and linguistically diverse population lives in the south, with densities ranging from 54 persons per square kilometer in the Logone River basin to 0. 1 persons in the northern B. E. T.  (Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti) desert region, which itself is larger than France.  The capital city of N'Djaména, situated at the confluence of the Chari and Logone Rivers, is cosmopolitan in nature, with a current population in excess of 700,000 people. 

Demographics of Chad<====>5331<====>Demographics of Chad The people of Chad speak more than 100 different languages and divide themselves into many ethnic groups.  However, language and ethnicity are not the same.  Moreover, neither element can be tied to a particular physical type.  Although the possession of a common language shows that its speakers have lived together and have a common history, peoples also change languages.  This is particularly so in Chad, where the openness of the terrain, marginal rainfall, frequent drought and famine, and low population densities have encouraged physical and linguistic mobility.  Slave raids among  non-Muslim peoples, internal slave trade, and exports of captives northward from the ninth to the twentieth centuries also have resulted in language changes. 

Politics of Chad<====>5332<====>Politics of Chad  Politics of Chad takes place in a framework of a presidential republic, whereby the President of Chad is both head of state and head of government.  Executive power is exercised by the government.  Legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament.  Chad is one of the most corrupt countries in the world. In May 2013, security forces in Chad foiled a coup against the President Idriss Deby that had been in preparation for several months.  Executive branch |President|Idriss Déby|Patriotic Salvation Movement|2 December 1990|-|Prime Minister|Albert Pahimi Padacké|National Rally for Democracy|15 February 2016|}A strong executive branch headed by President Idriss Déby dominates the Chadian political system. 

Economy of Chad<====>5333<====>Economy of Chad  Landlocked Chad[[Chad]]'s economic development suffers from its geographic remoteness, drought, lack of infrastructure, and political turmoil.  About 85% of the population depends on agriculture, including the herding of livestock.  Of Africa's Francophone countries, Chad benefited least from the 50% devaluation of their currencies in January 1994.  Financial aid from the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and other sources is directed largely at the improvement of agriculture, especially livestock production.  Because of lack of financing, the development of oil fields near Doba, originally due to finish in 2000, was delayed until 2003. 

Telecommunications in Chad<====>5334<====>Telecommunications in ChadTelecommunications in Chad include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet. Radio and televisionRadio stations:state-owned radio network, Radiodiffusion Nationale Tchadienne (RNT), operates national and regional stations; about 10 private radio stations; some stations rebroadcast programs from international broadcasters (2007); "Communications: Chad", World Factbook, U.

Transport in Chad<====>5335<====>Transport in Chad  Transport infrastructure within Chad is generally poor, especially in the north and east of the country.   River transport is limited to the south-west corner.  As of 2011 Chad had no railways though two lines are planned - from the capital to the Sudanese and Cameroonian borders. during the wet season, especially in the southern half of the country.   In the north, roads are merely tracks across the desert and land mines continue to present a danger.   Draft animals (horses, donkeys and camels) remain important in much of the country. 

Military of Chad<====>5336<====>Military of Chad The military of Chad consists of the National Army (includes Ground Forces, Air Force, and Gendarmerie), Republican Guard, Rapid Intervention Force, Police, and National and Nomadic Guard (GNNT).  Currently the main task of the Chadian military is to combat the various rebel forces inside the country. History From independence through the period of the presidency of Félix Malloum (1975–79), the official national army was known as the Chadian Armed Forces (Forces Armées Tchadiennes—FAT).  Composed mainly of soldiers from southern Chad, FAT had its roots in the army recruited by France and had military traditions dating back to World War I. 

Foreign relations of Chad<====>5337<====>Foreign relations of Chad  The foreign relations of Chad are significantly influenced by the desire for oil revenue and investment in Chadian oil industry and support for Chadian President Idriss Déby.  Chad is officially non-aligned but has close relations with France, the former colonial power.  Relations with neighbouring Libya, and Sudan vary periodically.  Lately, the Idris Déby regime has been waging an intermittent proxy war with Sudan.  Aside from those two countries, Chad generally enjoys good relations with its neighbouring states. Relations with other African and Arab statesAlthough relations with Libya improved with the presidency of Idriss Déby, strains persist. 

Colloid<====>5346<====>Colloid   In chemistry, a colloid is a mixture in which one substance of microscopically dispersed insoluble particles is suspended throughout another substance.  Sometimes the dispersed substance alone is called the colloid;  the term colloidal suspension refers unambiguously to the overall mixture (although a narrower sense of the word suspension is distinguished from colloids by larger particle size).  Unlike a solution, whose solute and solvent constitute only one phase, a colloid has a dispersed phase (the suspended particles) and a continuous phase (the medium of suspension).  To qualify as a colloid, the mixture must be one that does not settle or would take a very long time to settle appreciably. 

Riding shotgun<====>5350<====>Riding shotgun  Riding shotgun was used to describe the guard who rode alongside a stagecoach driver, ready to use his shotgun to ward off bandits or hostile Native Americans.  In modern use, it refers to the practice of sitting alongside the driver in a moving vehicle.  The phrase has been used to mean giving actual or figurative support or aid to someone in a situation.   The earliest coining of this phrase dates to at most 1919.  EtymologyThe expression "riding shotgun" is derived from "shotgun messenger", a colloquial term for "express messenger", when stagecoach travel was popular during the American Wild West and the Colonial period in Australia. 

Cooking<====>5355<====>Cooking  Cooking or cookery is the art, technology and craft of preparing food for consumption with or without the use of heat.  Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world, from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves, to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting unique environmental, economic, and cultural traditions and trends.  The ways or types of cooking also depend on the skill and type of training an individual cook has.  Cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments. 

Card game<====>5360<====>Card game   A card game is any game using playing cards as the primary device with which the game is played, be they traditional or game-specific.  Countless card games exist, including families of related games (such as poker).  A small number of card games played with traditional decks have formally standardized rules, but most are folk games whose rules vary by region, culture, and person.  Many games that are not generally placed in the family of card games do in fact use cards for some aspect of their gameplay.  Similarly, some games that are placed in the card game genre involve a board. 

Cross-stitch<====>5361<====>Cross-stitch Cross-stitch is a form of sewing and a popular form of counted-thread embroidery in which X-shaped stitches in a tiled, raster-like pattern are used to form a picture.  The stitcher counts the threads on a piece of evenweave fabric (such as linen) in each direction so that the stitches are of uniform size and appearance.  This form of cross-stitch is also called counted cross-stitch in order to distinguish it from other forms of cross-stitch.   Sometimes cross-stitch is done on designs printed on the fabric (stamped cross-stitch); the stitcher simply stitches over the printed pattern.   Cross-stitch is also executed on easily countable fabric called aida cloth but the threads are not actually counted. 

Casino game<====>5362<====>Casino game Games available in most casinos are commonly called casino games.  In a casino game, the players gamble casino chips on various possible random outcomes or combinations of outcomes.  Casino games are also available in online casinos, where permitted by law.  Casino games can also be played outside casinos for entertainment purposes like in parties or in school competitions, some on machines that simulate gambling. CategoriesThere are three general categories of casino games: table games, electronic gaming machines, and random number ticket games such as Keno and simulated racing.  Gaming machines, such as slot machines and pachinko, are usually played by one player at a time and do not require the involvement of casino employees to play. 

Video game<====>5363<====>Video gameA video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor.  The word video in video game traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images.  Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. The electronic systems used to play video games are known as platforms; examples of these are personal computers and video game consoles. 

Cambrian<====>5367<====>Cambrian    The Cambrian Period (  or  ) was the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era, of the Phanerozoic Eon.The Cambrian lasted 55. 6 million years from the end of the preceding Ediacaran Period 541 million years ago (mya) to the beginning of the Ordovician Period   mya.Its subdivisions, and its base, are somewhat in flux.   The period was established (as “Cambrian series”) by Adam Sedgwick,  who named it after Cambria, the Latinised form of Cymru, the Welsh name for Wales, where Britain's Cambrian rocks are best exposed. 

Category of being<====>5370<====>Category of being In ontology, the different kinds or ways of being are called categories of being; or simply categories.  To investigate the categories of being is to determine the most fundamental and the broadest classes of entities.  A distinction between such categories, in making the categories or applying them, is called an ontological distinction. IntroductionThe categories of being, or simply "the categories", are defined as the highest classes under which all elements of being, whether material or conceptual, can be classified.  These categories belong to the realm of philosophy and the difference between categories and classes was described by the philosopher C. 

Concrete<====>5371<====>Concrete   Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens over time.  Most concretes used are lime-based concretes such as Portland cement concrete or concretes made with other hydraulic cements, such as calcium aluminate cements.  However, asphalt concrete, which is frequently used for road surfaces, is also a type of concrete, where the cement material is bitumen, and polymer concretes are sometimes used where the cementing material is a polymer. When aggregate is mixed together with dry Portland cement and water, the mixture forms a fluid slurry that is easily poured and molded into shape. 

Coitus interruptus<====>5373<====>Coitus interruptus Coitus interruptus, also known as the rejected sexual intercourse, withdrawal or pull-out method, is a method of birth control in which a man, during sexual intercourse, withdraws his penis from a woman's vagina prior to orgasm (and ejaculation) and then directs his ejaculate (semen) away from the vagina in an effort to avoid insemination. This method of contraception, widely used for at least two millennia, is still in use today.  This method was used by an estimated 38 million couples worldwide in 1991.    , which cites: Population Action International (1991).  "A Guide to Methods of Birth Control. 

Condom<====>5374<====>CondomA condom is a sheath-shaped barrier device, used during sexual intercourse to reduce the probability of pregnancy or a sexually transmitted infection (STIs).There are both male and female condoms.With proper use—and use at every act of intercourse—women whose partners use male condoms experience a 2% per-year pregnancy rate.   With typical use the rate of pregnancy is 18% per-year.Their use greatly decreases the risk of gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, hepatitis B, and HIV/AIDS.   They also to a lesser extent protect against genital herpes, human papillomavirus (HPV), and syphilis. 

Country code<====>5375<====>Country code Country codes are short alphabetic or numeric geographical codes (geocodes) developed to represent countries and dependent areas, for use in data processing and communications.  Several different systems have been developed to do this.   The term country code frequently refers to international dialing codes, the E. 164 country calling codes. ISO 3166-1 This standard defines for most of the countries and dependent areas in the world:a two-letter (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2)a three-letter (ISO 3166-1 alpha-3), anda three-digit numeric (ISO 3166-1 numeric) code. The two-letter codes are used as the basis for some other codes or applications, for example,for ISO 4217 currency codes andwith deviations, for country code top-level domain names (ccTLDs) on the Internet: list of Internet TLDs. 

Cladistics<====>5376<====>Cladistics   Cladistics (from Greek  , klados, i. e. , "branch")    is an approach to biological classification in which organisms are categorized based on shared derived characteristics that can be traced to a group's most recent common ancestor and are not present in more distant ancestors.  Therefore, members of a group are assumed to share a common history and are considered to be closely related.  Columbia EncyclopediaOxford Dictionary of English  Oxford English Dictionary The techniques and nomenclature of cladistics have been applied to other disciplines.   (See phylogenetic nomenclature. 

Calendar<====>5377<====>Calendar    A calendar is a system of organizing days for social, religious, commercial or administrative purposes.  This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months and years.  A date is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system.  A calendar is also a physical record (often paper) of such a system.  A calendar can also mean a list of planned events, such as a court calendar or a partly or fully chronological list of documents, such as a calendar of wills. Periods in a calendar (such as years and months) are usually, though not necessarily, synchronised with the cycle of the sun or the moon. 

Physical cosmology<====>5378<====>Physical cosmology    Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate.  For an overview, seeCosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws.  Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. 

Inflation (cosmology)<====>5382<====>Inflation (cosmology)In physical cosmology, cosmic inflation, cosmological inflation, or just inflation, is a theory of exponential expansion of space in the early universe.  The inflationary epoch lasted from 10 −36  seconds after the conjectured Big Bang singularity to sometime between 10 −33  and 10 −32  seconds after the singularity.  Following the inflationary period, the Universe continues to expand, but at a less rapid rate.  Inflation theory was first developed by Alan Guth at Cornell in 1979.  It developed further in the early 1980s.  It explains the origin of the large-scale structure of the cosmos. 

Candela<====>5385<====>Candela   The candela (  or  ; symbol: cd) is the base unit of luminous intensity in the International System of Units (SI); that is, luminous power per unit solid angle emitted by a point light source in a particular direction.  Luminous intensity is analogous to radiant intensity, but instead of simply adding up the contributions of every wavelength of light in the source's spectrum, the contribution of each wavelength is weighted by the standard luminosity function (a model of the sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths).    A common wax candle emits light with a luminous intensity of roughly one candela. 

Condensed matter physics<====>5387<====>Condensed matter physics Condensed matter physics is a branch of physics that deals with the physical properties of condensed phases of matter,    where particles adhere to each other.  Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using physical laws.  In particular, they include the laws of quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and statistical mechanics. The most familiar condensed phases are solids and liquids while more exotic condensed phases include the superconducting phase exhibited by certain materials at low temperature, the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on crystal lattices of atoms, and the Bose–Einstein condensate found in ultracold atomic systems. 

Cultural anthropology<====>5388<====>Cultural anthropologyCultural anthropology is a branch of anthropology focused on the study of cultural variation among humans.  It is in contrast to social anthropology, which perceives cultural variation as a subset of the anthropological constant.  Cultural anthropology has a rich methodology, including participant observation (often called fieldwork because it requires the anthropologist spending an extended period of time at the research location), interviews, and surveys.  One of the earliest articulations of the anthropological meaning of the term "culture" came from Sir Edward Tylor who writes on the first page of his 1871 book: "Culture, or civilization, taken in its broad, ethnographic sense, is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society. 

Conversion of units<====>5390<====>Conversion of units Conversion of units is the conversion between different units of measurement for the same quantity, typically through multiplicative conversion factors. Techniques Process overviewThe process of conversion depends on the specific situation and the intended purpose.   This may be governed by regulation, contract,  technical specifications or other published standards.   Engineering judgment may include such factors as:The precision and accuracy of measurement and the associated uncertainty of measurement. The statistical confidence interval or tolerance interval of the initial measurement. The number of significant figures of the measurement. The intended use of the measurement including the engineering tolerances. 

City<====>5391<====>City A city is a large human settlement.  Goodall, B.  (1987) The Penguin Dictionary of Human Geography.  London: Penguin.   Kuper, A.  and Kuper, J. , eds (1996) The Social Science Encyclopedia.  2nd edition.  London: Routledge.   Cities generally have extensive systems for housing, tranportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, and communication.  Their density facilitates interaction between people, government organizations and businesses, sometimes benefiting different parties in the process. Historically, city-dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall, but following two centuries of unprecedented and rapid urbanization, roughly half of the world population now lives in cities, which has had profound consequences for global sustainability. 

Coriander (plant)<====>5393<====>Coriander (plant)

Chervil<====>5394<====>Chervil   Chervil ( ; Anthriscus cerefolium), sometimes called French parsley or garden chervil (to distinguish it from similar plants also called chervil), is a delicate annual herb related to parsley.  It is commonly used to season mild-flavoured dishes and is a constituent of the French herb mixture fines herbes. BiologyA member of the Apiaceae, chervil is native to the Caucasus but was spread by the Romans through most of Europe, where it is now naturalised.    The plants grow to  , with tripinnate leaves that may be curly.  The small white flowers form small umbels,   across. 

Chives<====>5395<====>Chives    Chives is the common name of Allium schoenoprasum, an edible species of the Allium genus.Its close relatives include the garlic, shallot, leek, scallion,    and Chinese onion.    A perennial plant, it is widespread in nature across much of Europe, Asia, and North America.    A.  schoenoprasum is the only species of Allium native to both the New and the Old Worlds.  Ernest Small    James Cullen, Sabina G.  Knees, H.  Suzanne Cubey (Editors)   Chives are a commonly used herb and can be found in grocery stores or grown in home gardens. 

Chris Morris (satirist)<====>5397<====>Chris Morris (satirist)   Christopher J Morris (born 15 June 1962) is an English comedian, writer, director, actor, voice actor, and producer.  He is known for his black humour, surrealism, and controversial subject matter, and has been hailed for his "uncompromising, moralistic drive" by the British Film Institute.    In the early 1990s, Morris teamed up with his radio producer, Armando Iannucci, to create On the Hour, a satire of news programmes.  This was expanded into a television spin off, The Day Today, which launched the career of Steve Coogan, and has since been hailed as one of the most important satirical shows of the 1990s. 

Colorado<====>5399<====>Colorado    Colorado (   ) is a state of the United States encompassing most of the southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains.  It is the 8th largest geographically and 21st most populous U. S.  state.  The estimated population of Colorado was 5,540,545 on July 1, 2016, an increase of 10. 17% since the 2010 United States Census.    The state was named for the Colorado River, which Spanish travelers named the Río Colorado for the ruddy silt the river carried from the mountains. 

Carboniferous<====>5401<====>Carboniferous  The Carboniferous is a geologic period and system that spans 60 million years from the end of the Devonian Period   million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Permian Period,   Mya.  The name Carboniferous means "coal-bearing" and derives from the Latin words   ("coal") and   ("I bear, I carry"), and was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822.  Based on a study of the British rock succession, it was the first of the modern 'system' names to be employed, and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during that time. 

Comoros<====>5403<====>ComorosThe Comoros ( ;  ,  ), officially the Union of the Comoros (Comorian: Udzima wa Komori,  ,    ), is a sovereign archipelago island nation in the Indian Ocean located at the northern end of the Mozambique Channel off the eastern coast of Africa between northeastern Mozambique and northwestern Madagascar.  Other countries near the Comoros are Tanzania to the northwest and the Seychelles to the northeast.  Its capital is Moroni, on Grande Comore.  The Union of the Comoros has three official languages – Comorian, Arabic and French. 

Critical philosophy<====>5404<====>Critical philosophy Attributed to Immanuel Kant, the critical philosophy ( ) movement sees the primary task of philosophy as criticism rather than justification of knowledge; criticism, for Kant, meant judging as to the possibilities of knowledge before advancing to knowledge itself (from the Greek kritike (techne), or "art of judgment").  The basic task of philosophers, according to this view, is not to establish and demonstrate theories about reality, but rather to subject all theories—including those about philosophy itself—to critical review, and measure their validity by how well they withstand criticism. "Critical philosophy" is also used as another name for Kant's philosophy itself. 

China<====>5405<====>China   China , officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia and the world's most populous country, with a population of around Expression error: Unrecognised punctuation character: "{" billion.   Covering approximately  , it is the third- or fourth-largest country by total area,   depending on the source consulted.   China also has the most neighbor countries in the world.  Governed by the Communist Party of China, it exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces , five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. 

California<====>5407<====>California{{Infobox U. S.  state symbols }}California is a state in the Pacific Region of the United States.   With 39. 5 million residents, California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area.  The state capital is Sacramento.  The Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the nation's second- and fifth-most populous urban regions, with 18. 7 million and 8. 8 million residents respectively.   Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. 

Columbia River<====>5408<====>Columbia River    The Columbia River is the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of North America.   The river rises in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, Canada.  It flows northwest and then south into the US state of Washington, then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of Oregon before emptying into the Pacific Ocean.  The river is   long, and its largest tributary is the Snake River.  Its drainage basin is roughly the size of France and extends into seven US states and a Canadian province. 

Commelinales<====>5409<====>Commelinales  Commelinales is the botanical name of an order of flowering plants.  It comprises five families: Commelinaceae, Haemodoraceae, Hanguanaceae, Philydraceae, and Pontederiaceae.  All the families combined contain over 885 species in about 70 genera; the majority of species are in the Commelinaceae.  Plants in the order share a number of synapomorphies that tie them together, such as a lack of mycorrhizal associations and tapetal raphides.  Estimates differ as to when the Comminales evolved, but most suggest an origin and diversification sometime during the mid- to late Cretaceous.  Depending on the methods used, studies suggest a range of origin between 123 and 73 million years, with diversification occurring within the group 110 to 66 million years ago. 

Cyperales<====>5410<====>Cyperales Cyperales is a name for an order of flowering plants.  As used in the Engler system (update, of 1964) and in the Wettstein system it consisted of only the single family. In the Cronquist system it is used for an order (placed in subclass Commelinidae) and circumscribed as (1981):order Cyperalesfamily Cyperaceaefamily Poaceae (or Gramineae)The APG system assigns the plants involved to the order Poales.  

Cucurbitales<====>5411<====>Cucurbitales The Cucurbitales are an order of flowering plants, included in the rosid group of dicotyledons.  This order mostly belongs to tropical areas, with limited presence in subtropic and temperate regions.  The order includes shrubs and trees, together with many herbs and climbers.

In 1762, Havana was briefly occupied by Great Britain, before being returned to Spain in exchange for Florida.  A series of rebellions during the 19th century failed to end Spanish rule.  However, the Spanish–American War resulted in a Spanish withdrawal from the island in 1898, and following three-and-a-half years of subsequent US military rule,  Cuba gained formal independence in 1902. 

Economy of Cuba<====>5588<====>Economy of Cuba Cuba has a planned economy dominated by state-run enterprises.  Most industries are owned and operated by the government and most of the labor force is employed by the state.  Following the fall of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party encouraged the formation of worker co-operatives and self-employment. In the year 2000, public sector employment was 76% and private sector employment, mainly composed of self-employment, was 23% compared to the 1981 ratio of 91% to 8%.   Investment is restricted and requires approval by the government.  The government sets most prices and rations goods to citizens. 

Transport in Cuba<====>5590<====>Transport in Cuba Transportation in Cuba is composed of a system of railways, roads, airports, waterways, ports and harbours:Railways total: 8,285 kmstandard gauge: 8,125 km   gauge (105 km electrified)narrow gauge: 160 km gaugeCuba built the first railway system in the Spanish empire, before the 1848 start in the Iberian peninsula.  While the rail infrastructure dates from colonial and early republican times, passenger service along the principal Havana to Santiago corridor is increasingly reliable and popular with tourists who can purchase tickets in Cuban convertible pesos.  As with most public transport in Cuba, the vehicles used are second hand, and the flagship Tren Francés ("French train") between Havana and Santiago de Cuba is operated by coaches originally used in Europe between Paris and Amsterdam on the ex-TEE. 

Foreign relations of Cuba<====>5592<====>Foreign relations of Cuba Cuba's foreign policy has been fluid throughout history depending on world events and other variables, including relations with the United States.  Without massive Soviet subsidies and its primary trading partner, Cuba was comparatively isolated in the 1990s after the fall of the USSR and the end of the Cold War, but has since entered bilateral co-operation with several South American countries, most notably Venezuela and Bolivia.  The United States used to stick to a policy of isolating Cuba until December 2014, when Barack Obama announced a new policy of diplomatic and economic engagement.  The European Union accuses Cuba of "continuing flagrant violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms". 

Cyprus<====>5593<====>Cyprus  Cyprus,  officially the Republic of Cyprus,  is an island country in the Eastern Mediterranean and the third largest and third most populous island in the Mediterranean.  Cyprus is located south of Turkey, west of Syria and Lebanon, northwest of Israel, north of Egypt, and southeast of Greece. The earliest known human activity on the island dates to around the 10th millennium BC.  Archaeological remains from this period include the well-preserved Neolithic village of Khirokitia, and Cyprus is home to some of the oldest water wells in the world.Cyprus was settled by Mycenaean Greeks in two waves in the 2nd millennium BC. 

Geography of Cyprus<====>5595<====>Geography of Cyprus Cyprus is an island in the Eastern Basin of the Mediterranean Sea.  It is the third largest island in the Mediterranean (after the Italian islands of Sicily and Sardinia) and the world's 81st largest island by area.  It is located south of Asia Minor, the Anatolian peninsula  of the Asian (or Eurasian) mainland (part of Turkey), so it may be included in Western Asia  or the Middle East:  Cyprus is close to Southern Europe, and Northern Africa, and has had lengthy periods of mainly Greek and intermittent Anatolian, Levantine, Byzantine, Turkish, and Western European influence. 

Demographics of Cyprus<====>5596<====>Demographics of CyprusThe people of Cyprus are broadly divided into two main ethnic communities, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, who share many cultural traits but maintain distinct identities based on ethnicity, religion, language, and close ties with their respective motherlands.  Before the dispute started in 1964 the peoples of Cyprus (then 77% Greek Cypriots, 18% Turkish Cypriots, 5% other communities, including Armenians and Maronites)  were dispersed over the entire island. The Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 de facto partitioned the island into two political areas: 99. 5% of Greek Cypriots now live in the Republic of Cyprus while 98. 

Politics of Cyprus<====>5597<====>Politics of Cyprus  The Republic of Cyprus is a unitary presidential representative republic, whereby the President of Cyprus is both head of state and head of government.  Executive power is exercised by the government.  Legislative power is vested in both the government and the parliament.  The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. Cyprus has been a divided island since 1974 when Turkey invaded the north in response to a military coup on the island which was backed by the Athens government.    Since then, the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus has controlled the south two-thirds, and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, only recognized by Turkey, the northern one-third. 

Economy of Cyprus<====>5598<====>Economy of Cyprus  The economy of Cyprus is classified by the World Bank as a high-income economy,  and was included by the International Monetary Fund in its list of advanced economies in 2001.   Erratic growth rates in the 1990s reflected the economy's vulnerability to swings in tourist arrivals, caused by political instability on the island and fluctuations in economic conditions in Western Europe. On 1 January 2008, the country adopted the euro as its official currency, replacing the Cypriot pound at an irrevocable fixed exchange rate of CYP 0. 585274 per EUR 1. 00. The 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis, part of the wider European debt crisis, has dominated the country's economic affairs in recent times. 

Transport in Cyprus<====>5600<====>Transport in CyprusBecause Cyprus has no working railway system, various other methods of transport are  needed to ensure the proper delivery of any cargo, be it human or freight.   Since the last railway was dismantled in 1952, the only remaining modes of transport are by road, by sea, and by air. Roads Of the 12,118 km of roads in the areas controlled by the Republic of Cyprus in 2006, 7,850 km were paved, while 4,268 km were unpaved.  In 1996, the Turkish Cypriot area showed a close, but smaller ratio of paved to unpaved with about 1,370 km out of 2,350 km paved and 980 km unpaved. 

Foreign relations of Cyprus<====>5602<====>Foreign relations of Cyprus Cyprus is a member of the United Nationsalong with most of its agencies as well as the Commonwealth of Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Council of Europe.  In addition, the country has signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Agreement (MIGA).  Cyprus has been a member of the European Union since 2004 and in the second half of the 2012 it held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  Non-alignmentCyprus has historically followed a non-aligned foreign policy, although it increasingly identifies with the West in its cultural affinities and trade patterns, and maintains close relations with European Union, Greece and Israel. 

Cretaceous<====>5615<====>Cretaceous The Cretaceous ( ,  ) is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period   million years ago (mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period   mya.  It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era.  The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation Kreide (chalk). The Cretaceous was a period with a relatively warm climate, resulting in high eustatic sea levels that created numerous shallow inland seas.  These oceans and seas were populated with now-extinct marine reptiles, ammonites and rudists, while dinosaurs continued to dominate on land. 

Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease<====>5617<====>Creutzfeldt–Jakob diseaseCreutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) is a universally fatal brain disorder.   Early symptoms include memory problems, behavioral changes, poor coordination, and visual disturbances.   Later dementia, involuntary movements, blindness, weakness, and coma occur.   About 90% of people die within a year of diagnosis.   CJD is believed to be caused by a protein known as a prion.   Infectious prions are misfolded proteins that can cause normally folded proteins to become misfolded.   Most cases occur spontaneously, while about 7. 5% of cases are inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal dominant manner. 

C. Northcote Parkinson<====>5622<====>C.  Northcote Parkinson   Cyril Northcote Parkinson (30 July 1909 – 9 March 1993) was a British naval historian and author of some 60 books, the most famous of which was his best-seller Parkinson's Law, which led him to be also considered as an important scholar in public administration and management. Parkinson and his 'law'Parkinson's law, which provides insight into a primary barrier to efficient time management, states that, "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion".

Canal<====>5623<====>Canal   Canals and navigations are human-made channels for water conveyance (supply), or to service water transport vehicles.  In the vernacular, both are referred to as 'canals', and in most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create areas of low speed current flow.  These areas are referred to as 'slack water levels', often just called 'levels'.  The main difference between them is that a navigation parallels a river and shares part of its waters, its drainage basin and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its long stretches of deep enough slack water levels while staying in its valley. 

Cognitive science<====>5626<====>Cognitive science  Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes.    It examines the nature, the tasks, and the functions of cognition (in a broad sense).  Cognitive scientists study intelligence and behavior, with a focus on how nervous systems represent, process, and transform information.  Mental faculties of concern to cognitive scientists include language, perception, memory, attention, reasoning, and emotion; to understand these faculties, cognitive scientists borrow from fields such as linguistics, psychology, artificial intelligence, philosophy, neuroscience, and anthropology.

Copula (linguistics)<====>5630<====>Copula (linguistics)In linguistics, a copula (plural: copulas or copulae; abbreviated  ) is a word used to link the subject of a sentence with a predicate (a subject complement), such as the word is in the sentence "The sky is blue. " The word copula derives from the Latin noun for a "link" or "tie" that connects two different things.  A copula is often a verb or a verb-like word, though this is not universally the case. A verb that is a copula is sometimes called a copulative or copular verb.   In English primary education grammar courses, a copula is often called a linking verb.

Christopher Columbus<====>5635<====>Christopher Columbus Christopher Columbus  (  20 May 1506) was an Italian explorer, navigator, and colonizer.  Born in the Republic of Genoa,  under the auspices of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain he completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean.  Those voyages and his efforts to establish settlements on the island of Hispaniola, initiated the permanent European colonization of the New World. At a time when European kingdoms were beginning to establish new trade routes and colonies, motivated by imperialism and economic competition, Columbus proposed to reach the East Indies (South and Southeast Asia) by sailing westward. 

Chemist<====>5636<====>Chemist A chemist (from Greek chēm (ía) alchemy + -ist; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchimista ) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry.  Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties.  Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms.  Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties.  The word 'chemist' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English. Chemists use this knowledge to learn the composition,  and properties of unfamiliar substances, as well as to reproduce and synthesize large quantities of useful naturally occurring substances and create new artificial substances and useful processes. 

Cypress Hill<====>5637<====>Cypress Hill  Cypress Hill is an American hip hop music group from South Gate, California.  Cypress Hill was the first Latino American hip hop recording group to have platinum and multi-platinum albums, selling over 18 million albums worldwide.  They are considered to be among the main progenitors of West Coast rap and hip hop in the early 1990s, being critically acclaimed for their first four albums.  Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p.  316.   The band has also advocated for medical and recreational use of cannabis in the United States. 

Combustion<====>5638<====>Combustion  Combustion   or burning  is a high-temperature exothermic redox chemical reaction between a fuel (the reductant) and an oxidant, usually atmospheric oxygen, that produces oxidized, often gaseous products, in a mixture termed as smoke.  Combustion in a fire produces a flame, and the heat produced can make combustion self-sustaining.  Combustion is often a complicated sequence of elementary radical reactions.  Solid fuels, such as wood and coal, first undergo endothermic pyrolysis to produce gaseous fuels whose combustion then supplies the heat required to produce more of them.  Combustion is often hot enough that light in the form of either glowing or a flame is produced. 

Cyrillic script<====>5639<====>Cyrillic script    The Cyrillic script   is a writing system used for various alphabets across Eurasia (particularity in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and North Asia).  It is based on the Early Cyrillic alphabet developed during the 9th century AD at the Preslav Literary School in the First Bulgarian Empire.It is the basis of alphabets used in various languages, especially those of Orthodox Slavic origin, and non-Slavic languages influenced by Russian.   , around 252 million people in Eurasia use it as the official alphabet for their national languages, with Russia accounting for about half of them. 

Consonant<====>5641<====>Consonant   In articulatory phonetics, a consonant is a speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract.  Examples are  , pronounced with the lips;  , pronounced with the front of the tongue;  , pronounced with the back of the tongue;  , pronounced in the throat;   and  , pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel (fricatives); and   and  , which have air flowing through the nose (nasals).  Contrasting with consonants are vowels. Since the number of possible sounds in all of the world's languages is much greater than the number of letters in any one alphabet, linguists have devised systems such as the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to assign a unique and unambiguous symbol to each attested consonant. 

Costume jewelry<====>5642<====>Costume jewelry Costume jewelry, trinkets, fashion jewelry, junk jewelry, fake jewelry, or fallalery is jewelry manufactured as ornamentation to complement a particular fashionable costume or garment Baker, Lillian.  Fifty Years of Collectable Fashion Jewelry.  Paducah: Collector Books, 1986.   as opposed to "real" (fine) jewelry which may be regarded primarily as collectibles, keepsakes, or investments. EtymologyThe term costume jewelry dates back to the early 20th century.  It reflects the use of the word "costume" to refer to what is now called an "outfit". ComponentsOriginally, costume or fashion jewelry was made of inexpensive simulated gemstones, such as rhinestones or lucite, set in pewter, silver, nickel, or brass. 

Channel Islands<====>5643<====>Channel Islands    The Channel Islands (Norman: Îles d'la Manche, French: Îles Anglo-Normandes or Îles de la Manche ) are an archipelago in the English Channel, off the French coast of Normandy.  They include two Crown dependencies: the Bailiwick of Jersey, the largest of the islands; and the Bailiwick of Guernsey, consisting of Guernsey, Alderney, Sark and some smaller islands.  They are considered the remnants of the Duchy of Normandy and, although they are not part of the United Kingdom,  the UK is responsible for the defence and international relations of the islands.   The Crown dependencies are not members of the Commonwealth of Nations or of the European Union. 

Comedy film<====>5644<====>Comedy film Comedy is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor.  These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect.   Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception).  One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound.  When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue. 

Cult film<====>5645<====>Cult film    A cult film or cult movie, also commonly referred to as a cult classic, is a film that has acquired a cult following.  Cult films are known for their dedicated, passionate fanbase, an elaborate subculture that engage in repeated viewings, quoting dialogue, and audience participation.   Inclusive definitions allow for major studio productions, especially box office bombs, while exclusive definitions focus more on obscure, transgressive films shunned by the mainstream.   The difficulty in defining the term and subjectivity of what qualifies as a cult film mirror classificatory disputes about art.   The term cult film itself was first used in the 1970s to describe the culture that surrounded underground films and midnight movies, though cult was in common use in film analysis for decades prior to that. 

Constantinople<====>5646<====>Constantinople   Constantinople (  Konstantinoúpolis or   Konstantinoúpoli;  ;  ) was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine (330–1204 and 1261–1453), and also of the brief Latin (1204–1261), and the later Ottoman (1453–1923) empires.  It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD.  "Constantinople" in The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1991, p.  508.    From the mid-5th century to the early 13th century, Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe  and it was instrumental in the advancement of Christianity during Roman and Byzantine times as the home of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople and as the guardian of Christendom's holiest relics such as the Crown of Thorns and the True Cross.

Cornwall<====>5648<====>Cornwall Cornwall ( ,) is a county and duchy in South West England in the United Kingdom.  The county is bordered to the north and west by the Celtic Sea,  to the south by the English Channel, and to the east by the county of Devon, over the River Tamar which forms most of the border between them.  Cornwall forms the westernmost part of the South West Peninsula of the island of Great Britain.  The furthest southwestern point of the island is Land's End; the southernmost point is Lizard Point. 

Constitutional monarchy<====>5649<====>Constitutional monarchy  A constitutional monarchy is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign exercises their authorities in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution.   Constitutional monarchy differs from absolute monarchy (in which a monarch holds absolute power), in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework.  Constitutional monarchies range from countries such as Morocco, where the constitution grants substantial discretionary powers to the sovereign, to countries such as Japan where the monarch retains no formal authorities. A constitutional monarchy may refer to a system in which the monarch acts as a non-party political head of state under the constitution, whether written or unwritten. 

Clarke's three laws<====>5653<====>Clarke's three lawsBritish science fiction writer Arthur C.  Clarke formulated three adages that are known as Clarke's three laws, of which the third law is the best known and most widely cited:  When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, they are almost certainly right.  When they state that something is impossible, they are very probably wrong.   The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.   Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. OriginsAll three laws appear in Clarke's essay "Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination", first published in Profiles of the Future (1962). 

Caspar David Friedrich<====>5654<====>Caspar David Friedrich Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation.He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins.  His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world.  Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs "the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension". 

Courtney Love<====>5655<====>Courtney LoveCourtney Michelle Love (born Courtney Michelle Harrison; July 9, 1964) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and visual artist.  A notable presence in the punk and grunge scenes of the 1990s, Love has enjoyed a career that spans four decades.  She rose to prominence as the frontwoman of the alternative rock band Hole, which she formed in 1989.  Love has drawn public attention for her uninhibited live performances and confrontational lyrics, as well as her highly publicized personal life following her marriage to Kurt Cobain. The daughter of Hank Harrison and psychotherapist Linda Carroll, Love had an itinerant early life. 

Human cannibalism<====>5658<====>Human cannibalism   Human cannibalism is the act or practice of humans eating the flesh or internal organs of other human beings.  A person who practices cannibalism is called a cannibal.  The expression cannibalism has been extended into zoology to mean one individual of a species consuming all or part of another individual of the same species as food, including sexual cannibalism.  Some scholars have argued, however, that no firm evidence exists that cannibalism has ever been a socially acceptable practice anywhere in the world, at any time in history.   The Island Carib people of the Lesser Antilles, from whom the word cannibalism is derived, acquired a long-standing reputation as cannibals following the recording of their legends in the 17th century. 

Chemical element<====>5659<====>Chemical element   A chemical element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (that is, the same atomic number, or Z).118 elements are identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements.  There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radionuclides, which decay over time into other elements.  Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the Earth's crust. 

Centime<====>5661<====>Centime   Centime (from  ) is French for "cent", and is used in English as the name of the fraction currency in several Francophone countries (including Switzerland, Algeria, Belgium, Morocco and France). In France the usage of centime goes back to the introduction of the decimal monetary system under Napoleon.  This system aimed at replacing non-decimal fractions of older coins.  A five-centime coin was known as a sou, i. e.  a solidus or shilling. In Francophone Canada   of a Canadian dollar is officially known as a cent (pronounced /sɛnt/) in both English and French. 

Calendar year<====>5662<====>Calendar year Generally speaking, a calendar year begins on the New Year's Day of the given calendar system and ends on the day before the following New Year's Day, and thus consists of a whole number of days.  A year can also be measured by starting on any other named day of the calendar, and ending on the day before this named day in the following year.    This may be termed a "year's time", but not a "calendar year".   To reconcile the calendar year with the astronomical cycle (which has a fractional number of days) certain years contain extra days ("leap days" or "intercalary days"). 

CFA franc<====>5663<====>CFA francThe CFA franc (in French: franc CFA  , or colloquially franc) is the name of two currencies used in parts of West and Central African countries which are guaranteed by the French treasury.  The two CFA franc currencies are the West African CFA franc and the Central African CFA franc.  Although theoretically separate, the two CFA franc currencies are effectively interchangeable.  The ISO currency codes are XAF for the Central African CFA franc, whereas XOF for the West African CFA franc. Both CFA francs have a fixed exchange rate to the euro: 100 CFA francs = 1 former French (nouveau) franc = 0. 

Consciousness<====>5664<====>Consciousness  Consciousness is the state or quality of awareness, or, of being aware of an external object or something within oneself.   It has been defined variously in terms of sentience, awareness, qualia, subjectivity, the ability to experience or to  feel, wakefulness, having a sense of selfhood or soul, the fact that there is something "that it is like" to "have" or "be" it,  and the executive control system of the mind.In contemporary philosophy its definition is often hinted at via the logical possibility of its absence, the philosophical zombie, which is defined as a being whose behavior and function are identical to one's own yet there is "no-one in there" experiencing it. 

Currency<====>5665<====>Currency   A currency (from  , "in circulation", from  ), in the most specific use of the word, refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins. A more general definition is that a currency is a system of money (monetary units) in common use, especially in a nation.   Under this definition, US dollars, British pounds, Australian dollars, and European euros are examples of currency.  These various currencies are recognized stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies. 

Central bank<====>5666<====>Central bankA central bank, reserve bank, or monetary authority is an institution that manages a state's currency, money supply, and interest rates.  Central banks also usually oversee the commercial banking system of their respective countries.  In contrast to a commercial bank, a central bank possesses a monopoly on increasing the monetary base in the state, and usually also prints the national currency,  which usually serves as the state's legal tender.   Central banks also act as a "lender of last resort" to the banking sector during times of financial crisis.  Most central banks usually also have supervisory and regulatory powers to ensure the solvency of member institutions, prevent bank runs, and prevent reckless or fraudulent behavior by member banks. 

Chlorine<====>5667<====>Chlorine Chlorine is a chemical element with symbol Cl and atomic number 17.  The second-lightest of the halogens, it appears between fluorine and bromine in the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between them.  Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature.  It is an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent: among the elements, it has the highest electron affinity and the third-highest electronegativity, behind only oxygen and fluorine. The most common compound of chlorine, sodium chloride (common salt), has been known since ancient times.  Around 1630, chlorine gas was first synthesised in a chemical reaction, but not recognised as a fundamentally important substance. 

Calcium<====>5668<====>CalciumCalcium is a chemical element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20.  An alkaline earth metal, calcium is a reactive pale yellow metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer when exposed to air.  Its physical and chemical properties are most similar to its heavier homologues strontium and barium.  It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal, after iron and aluminium.  The most common calcium compound on Earth is calcium carbonate, found in limestone and the fossilised remnants of early sea life; gypsum, anhydrite, fluorite, and apatite are also sources of calcium. 

Chromium<====>5669<====>Chromium   Chromium is a chemical element with symbol Cr and atomic number 24.  It is the first element in group 6.  It is a steely-grey, lustrous, hard and brittle metal  which takes a high polish, resists tarnishing, and has a high melting point.  The name of the element is derived from the Greek word χρῶμα, chrōma, meaning color,  because many chromium compounds are intensely colored. Ferrochromium alloy is commercially produced from chromite by silicothermic or aluminothermic reactions and chromium metal by roasting and leaching processes followed by reduction with carbon and then aluminium. 

Cymbal<====>5671<====>Cymbal   A cymbal is a common percussion instrument.  Often used in pairs, cymbals consist of thin, normally round plates of various alloys.  The majority of cymbals are of indefinite pitch, although small disc-shaped cymbals based on ancient designs sound a definite note (see: crotales).  Cymbals are used in many ensembles ranging from the orchestra, percussion ensembles, jazz bands, heavy metal bands, and marching groups.  Drum kits usually incorporate at least a crash, ride or crash/ride, and a pair of hi-hat cymbals.  A player of cymbals is known as a cymbalist. Etymology and namesThe word cymbal is derived from the Latin cymbalum,  which is the latinisation of the Greek word   kymbalon, "cymbal",  which in turn derives from   kymbē, "cup, bowl". 

Cadmium<====>5672<====>Cadmium   Cadmium is a chemical element with symbol Cd and atomic number 48.  This soft, bluish-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in group 12, zinc and mercury.  Like zinc, it demonstrates oxidation state +2 in most of its compounds, and like mercury, it has a lower melting point than the transition metals in groups 3 through 11.  Cadmium and its congeners in group 12 are often not considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. 

Curium<====>5675<====>Curium   Curium is a transuranic radioactive chemical element with symbol Cm and atomic number 96.  This element of the actinide series was named after Marie and Pierre Curie – both were known for their research on radioactivity.  Curium was first intentionally produced and identified in July 1944 by the group of Glenn T.  Seaborg at the University of California, Berkeley.  The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945.  Most curium is produced by bombarding uranium or plutonium with neutrons in nuclear reactors – one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 20 grams of curium. 

Californium<====>5676<====>Californium   Californium is a radioactive chemical element with symbol Cf and atomic number 98.  The element was first synthesized in 1950 at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium-4 ions).  It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized, and has the second-highest atomic mass of all the elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see with the unaided eye (after einsteinium).  The element was named after the university and the state of California. Two crystalline forms exist for californium under normal pressure: one above and one below  . 

Christian Social Union in Bavaria<====>5679<====>Christian Social Union in Bavaria  The Christian Social Union in Bavaria ( ) is a Christian-democraticand conservative political party in Germany.  The CSU operates only in Bavaria, while its larger counterpart, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), operates in the other fifteen states of Germany.  The CSU has 46 seats in the Bundestag since the 2017 federal electionmaking it the smallest of the six parties represented. The CSU was founded in some ways as a continuation of the Weimar-era Catholic Bavarian People's Party (BVP). 

Corporate title<====>5681<====>Corporate title  Corporate titles or business titles are given to company and organization officials to show what duties and responsibilities they have in the organization.  Such titles are used in publicly and privately held for-profit corporations.  In addition, many non-profit organizations, educational institutions, partnerships, and sole proprietorships also confer corporate titles. Variations There are considerable variations in the composition and responsibilities of corporate titles. Within the corporate office or corporate center of a company, some companies have a Chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) as the top-ranking executive, while the number two is the President and Chief Operating Officer  (COO); other companies have a President and CEO but no official deputy.

Early life and careerDexter was born in Stamford, Lincolnshire, to Alfred and Dorothy Dexter.He had a brother, John, a fellow classicist, who taught Classics at The King's School, Peterborough, and a sister, Avril. 

College<====>5689<====>College   A college (Latin: collegium) is an educational institution or a constituent part of one.  A college may be a degree-awarding tertiary educational institution, a part of a collegiate or federal university, or an institution offering vocational education. In the United States, "college" often refers to a constituent part of a university or to a degree-awarding tertiary educational institution, but generally "college" and "university" are used interchangeably,  whereas in the United Kingdom, Oceania, South Asia and Southern Africa, "college" may refer to a secondary or high school, a college of further education, a training institution that awards trade qualifications, a higher education provider that does not have university status (often without its own degree-awarding powers), or a constituent part of a university (See this comparison of British and American English educational terminology for further information). 

Chalmers University of Technology<====>5690<====>Chalmers University of Technology  Chalmers University of Technology ( , often shortened to Chalmers) is a Swedish university located in Gothenburg that focuses on research and education in technology, natural science, architecture, maritime and other management areas.  HistoryThe University was founded in 1829 following a donation by William Chalmers, a director of the Swedish East India Company.  He donated part of his fortune for the establishment of an "industrial school".  Chalmers was run as a private institution until 1937, when the institute became a state-owned university.  In 1994, the school was incorporated as anaktiebolag under the control of the Swedish Government, the faculty and the Student Union. 

Codex<====>5691<====>Codex A codex ( ) (from the Latin caudex for "trunk of a tree" or block of wood, book), plural codices ( ), is a book constructed of a number of sheets of paper, vellum, papyrus, or similar materials.   The term is now usually only used of manuscript books, with hand-written contents,  but describes the format that is now near-universal for printed books in the Western world.   The book is usually bound by stacking the pages and fixing one edge, and using a cover thicker than the sheets.  Some codices are continuously folded like a concertina. 

Calf<====>5692<====>Calf A calf (plural, calves) is the young of domestic cattle.  Calves are reared to become adult cattle, or are slaughtered for their meat, called veal, and for their calfskin. The term "calf" is also used for some other species.  See "Other animals" below. Terminology "Calf" is the term used from birth to weaning, when it becomes known as a weaner or weaner calf, though in some areas the term "calf" may be used until the animal is a  .  The birth of a calf is known as calving.  A calf that has lost its mother is an orphan calf, also known as a poddy or poddy-calf in British English. 

Claude Shannon<====>5693<====>Claude Shannon  Claude Elwood Shannon (April 30, 1916 – February 24, 2001) was an American mathematician, electrical engineer, and cryptographer known as "the father of information theory".Shannon is noted for having founded information theory with a landmark paper, A Mathematical Theory of Communication, that he published in 1948.  He is, perhaps, equally well known for founding digital circuit design theory in 1937, when—as a 21-year-old master's degree student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)—he wrote his thesis demonstrating that electrical applications of Boolean algebra could construct any logical, numerical relationship.Shannon contributed to the field of cryptanalysis for national defense during World War II, including his fundamental work on codebreaking and secure telecommunications. 

Community<====>5695<====>Community    A community is a small or large social unit (a group of living things) who have something in common, such as norms, religion, values, or identity.   Communities often share a sense of place that is situated in a given geographical area (e. g.  a country, village, town, or neighborhood) or in virtual space through communication platforms.  Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community.  People tend to define those social ties as important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions like family, home, work, government, society, or humanity, at large. 

Community college<====>5696<====>Community college  A community college is a type of educational institution.  The term can have different meanings in different countries, but usually refers to an educational institution that provides workforce education and college transfer academic programs.   Some institutions maintain athletic teams and dormitories similar to their four-year counterparts. AustraliaIn Australia, the term "community college" refers to small private businesses running short (e. g.  6 weeks) courses generally of a self-improvement or hobbyist nature.  Equivalent to the American notion of community colleges are Tertiary And Further Education colleges or TAFEs; these are institutions mostly regulated at state and territory level. 

Civil Rights Memorial<====>5697<====>Civil Rights Memorial The Civil Rights Memorial is a memorial in Montgomery, Alabama, to 41 people who died in the struggle for the equal and integrated treatment of all people, regardless of race, during the Civil Rights Movement in the United States.The memorial is sponsored by the Southern Poverty Law Center.    DesignThe names included in the memorial belong to those who died between 1954 and 1968.  Those dates were chosen because in 1954 the U. S.  Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation in schools was unlawful and 1968 is the year of the assassination of Martin Luther King. 

Charles Babbage<====>5698<====>Charles BabbageCharles Babbage   ( ; 26 December 1791 – 18 October 1871) was an English polymath.A mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital programmable computer.    Considered by some to be a "father of the computer",Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer that eventually led to more complex electronic designs, though all the essential ideas of modern computers are to be found in Babbage's analytical engine.    His varied work in other fields has led him to be described as "pre-eminent" among the many polymaths of his century. 

Cross-dressing<====>5700<====>Cross-dressing Cross-dressing is the act of wearing items of clothing and other accoutrements commonly associated with the opposite sex within a particular society.   Cross-dressing has been used for purposes of disguise, comfort, and self-discovery in modern times and throughout history. Almost every human society throughout history has had expected norms for each gender relating to style, color, or type of clothing they are expected to wear, and likewise most societies have had a set of guidelines, views or even laws defining what type of clothing is appropriate for each gender. The term cross-dressing refers to an action or a behavior without attributing or implying any specific causes for that behavior. 

Channel Tunnel<====>5702<====>Channel Tunnel    The Channel Tunnel   ( ; also nicknamed the Chunnel)   is a   rail tunnel linking Folkestone, Kent, in the United Kingdom, with Coquelles, Pas-de-Calais, near Calais in northern France, beneath the English Channel at the Strait of Dover.  At its lowest point, it is   deep below the sea bed, and   below sea level.At  , the tunnel has the longest undersea portion of any tunnel in the world, although the Seikan Tunnel in Japan is both longer overall at   and deeper at   below sea level. 

Cyberpunk<====>5703<====>Cyberpunk  Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction in a futuristic setting that tends to focus on "a combination of low life and high tech"  featuring advanced technological and scientific achievements, such as artificial intelligence and cybernetics, juxtaposed with a degree of breakdown or radical change in the social order.  Much of cyberpunk is rooted in the New Wave science fiction movement of the 1960s and 70s, when writers like Philip K.  Dick,  Roger Zelazny, J. G.  Ballard, Philip Jose Farmer, and Harlan Ellison examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual revolution while avoiding the utopian tendencies of earlier science fiction. 

Comic strip<====>5704<====>Comic strip    A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions.  Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections.  With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as webcomics. There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes. 

Continuum hypothesis<====>5705<====>Continuum hypothesis In mathematics, the continuum hypothesis (abbreviated CH) is a hypothesis about the possible sizes of infinite sets.  It states: The continuum hypothesis was advanced by Georg Cantor in 1878, andestablishing its truth or falsehood is the first of Hilbert's 23 problems presented in 1900.  Τhe answer to this problem is independent of ZFC set theory (that is, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice included), so that either the continuum hypothesis or its negation can be added as an axiom to ZFC set theory, with the resulting theory being consistent if and only if ZFC is consistent. 

Çevik Bir<====>5706<====>Çevik BirÇevik Bir (born 1939) is a retired Turkish army general.  He was a member of the Turkish General Staff in the 1990s.  He took a major part in several important international missions in the Middle East and North Africa.  He was born in Buca, Izmir Province, in 1939 and is married with one child.    He graduated from the Turkish Military Academy as an engineer officer in 1958, from the Army Staff College in 1970 and from the Armed Forces College in 1971.  He graduated from NATO Defense College, Rome, Italy in 1973. 

Collectivism<====>5708<====>Collectivism   Collectivism is a cultural value that is characterized by emphasis on cohesiveness among individuals and prioritization of the group over self.  Individuals or groups that ascribe to a collectivistic worldview tend to find common values and goals as particularly salient  and demonstrate greater orientation toward in-group than toward out-group.The term “in-group” is thought to be more diffusely defined for collectivistic individuals to include societal units ranging from the nuclear family to a religious or racial/ethnic group. Meta-analytic findings support that collectivism shows a consistent association with discrete values, interpersonal patterns of interaction, cognition, perception and self-construal. 

Nepeta<====>5711<====>Nepeta  Nepeta is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae also known as catmints.  The genus name is reportedly in reference to Nepete, an ancient Etruscan city.  Missouri Botanical Garden: Nepeta × faassenii.  Accessed January 10, 2013  There are about 250 species.    The genus is native to Europe, Asia, and Africa, and has also naturalized in North America.  Some members of this group are known as catnip or catmint because of their effect on house cats – the nepetalactone contained in some Nepeta species binds to the olfactory receptors of cats, typically resulting in temporary euphoria. 

Cornish Nationalist Party<====>5714<====>Cornish Nationalist Party  The Cornish Nationalist Party (CNP;  ) is a political party, founded by Dr James Whetter, who campaigned for independence for Cornwall.   It was formed by people who left Cornwall's main nationalist party Mebyon Kernow on 28 May 1975, Mebyon Kernow and Cornish Nationalism by Dick Cole, Bernard Deacon, and Gary Tregidda  but it is no longer for independence.    A separate party with a similar name (Cornish National Party)  existed from 1969.  The split with Mebyon Kernow was based on the same debate that was occurring in most of the other political parties campaigning for autonomy from the United Kingdom at the time (such as the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru): whether to be a centre-left party, appealing to the electorate on a social democratic line, or whether to appeal emotionally on a centre-right cultural line. 

Cryptanalysis<====>5715<====>CryptanalysisCryptanalysis (from the Greek kryptós, "hidden", and analýein, "to loosen" or "to untie") is the study of analyzing information systems in order to study the hidden aspects of the systems.    Cryptanalysis is used to breach cryptographic security systems and gain access to the contents of encrypted messages, even if the cryptographic key is unknown. In addition to mathematical analysis of cryptographic algorithms, cryptanalysis includes the study of side-channel attacks that do not target weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithms themselves, but instead exploit weaknesses in their implementation. Even though the goal has been the same, the methods and techniques of cryptanalysis have changed drastically through the history of cryptography, adapting to increasing cryptographic complexity, ranging from the pen-and-paper methods of the past, through machines like the British Bombes and Colossus computers at Bletchley Park in World War II, to the mathematically advanced computerized schemes of the present. 

Chicano<====>5716<====>Chicano  Chicano or Chicana (also spelled Xicano or Xicana) is a chosen identity of some Mexican Americans in the United States.   The term Chicano is sometimes used interchangeably with Mexican-American.  Both names are chosen identities within the Mexican-American community in the United States; however, these terms have a wide range of meanings in various parts of the Southwest.  The term became widely used during the Chicano Movement by Mexican Americans to express pride in a shared cultural, ethnic and community identity. The term Chicano had negative connotations before the Chicano Movement, and still is viewed negatively by more conservative members of this community, but over time it has gained more acceptance as an identity of pride within the Mexican-American community in the United States. 

Canary Islands<====>5717<====>Canary Islands    The Canary Islands ( ;    ,  ) also known as the Canaries ( ), are an archipelago and autonomous community of Spain located on the Atlantic Ocean,   west of Morocco at the closest.  The Canaries are among the outermost regions (OMR) of the European Union proper.  It is also one of the eight regions with special consideration of historical nationality recognized as such by the Spanish Government.

Cutaway (filmmaking)<====>5719<====>Cutaway (filmmaking) In film and video, a cutaway shot is the interruption of a continuously filmed action by inserting a view of something else.   It is usually, although not always, followed by a cut back to the first shot, when the cutaway avoids a jump cut.   The cutaway shot does not necessarily contribute any dramatic content of its own, but is used to help the editor assemble a longer sequence.   For this reason, editors choose cutaway shots related to the main action, such as another action or object in the same location.   For example, if the main shot is of a man walking down an alley, possible cutaways may include a shot of a cat on a nearby dumpster or a shot of a person watching from a window overhead. 

Coma<====>5721<====>Coma   Coma is a state of unconsciousness in which a person cannot be awakened; fails to respond normally to painful stimuli, light, or sound; lacks a normal wake-sleep cycle; and does not initiate voluntary actions.A person in a state of coma is described as being comatose.  A distinction is made in the medical community between a real coma and a medically induced coma, the former is a result of circumstances beyond the control of the medical community, while the latter is a means by which medical professionals may allow a patient's injuries to heal in a controlled environment. 

Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)<====>5722<====>Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)   Call of Cthulhu is a horror fiction role-playing game based on H.  P.  Lovecraft's story of the same name and the associated Cthulhu Mythos.The game, often abbreviated as CoC, is published by Chaosium; it was first released in 1981 and is currently in its seventh edition, with many different versions released.  It makes use of Chaosium's Basic Role-Playing (BRP) system, with special rules for Sanity.  GameplayThe setting of Call of Cthulhu is a darker version of our world, based on H.  P.  Lovecraft's observation (from his essay, Supernatural Horror in Literature) that "The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.

Cape Breton Island<====>5724<====>Cape Breton Island  Cape Breton Island ( —formerly  ;   or  ;  ; or simply Cape Breton) is an island on the Atlantic coast of North America and part of the province of Nova Scotia, Canada.   Its name may derive from   near Bayonne, or more probably from the word  , the French demonym for  , the French historical region.    The   island accounts for 18. 7% of Nova Scotia's total area.  Although the island is physically separated from the Nova Scotia peninsula by the Strait of Canso, the   long rock-fill Canso Causeway connects it to mainland Nova Scotia. 

Cthulhu Mythos<====>5725<====>Cthulhu MythosThe Cthulhu Mythos is a shared fictional universe, based on the work of American horror writer H.  P.  Lovecraft.  The term was coined by August Derleth, a contemporary correspondent and protégé of Lovecraft, to identify the settings, tropes, and lore that were employed by Lovecraft and his literary successors.  The name Cthulhu derives from the central creature in Lovecraft's seminal short story, "The Call of Cthulhu", first published in the pulp magazine Weird Tales in 1928.   Richard L.  Tierney, a writer who also wrote Mythos tales, later applied the term "Derleth Mythos" to distinguish Lovecraft's works from Derleth's later stories, which modify key tenets of the Mythos. 

Crane shot<====>5726<====>Crane shot In filmmaking and video production, a crane shot is a shot taken by a camera on a moving crane or jib.  Most cranes accommodate both the camera and an operator, but some can be moved by remote control.  Camera cranes go back to the dawn of movie-making, and were frequently used in silent films to enhance the epic nature of large sets and massive crowds.  Another use is to move up and away from the actors, a common way of ending a movie.  Crane shots are often found in what are supposed to be emotional or suspenseful scenes. 

Chariots of Fire<====>5729<====>Chariots of Fire    Chariots of Fire is a 1981 British historical drama film.  It tells the fact-based story of two athletes in the 1924 Olympics: Eric Liddell, a devout Scottish Christian who runs for the glory of God, and Harold Abrahams, an English Jew who runs to overcome prejudice. The film was conceived and produced by David Puttnam, written by Colin Welland, and directed by Hugh Hudson.  Ben Cross and Ian Charleson starred as Abrahams and Liddell, alongside Nicholas Farrell, Nigel Havers, Ian Holm, Lindsay Anderson, John Gielgud, Cheryl Campbell, and Alice Krige in supporting roles. 

Consequentialism<====>5734<====>ConsequentialismConsequentialism is the class of normative ethical theories holding that the   of one's conduct are the ultimate basis for any judgment about the rightness or wrongness of that conduct.  Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right act (or omission from acting) is one that will produce a good outcome, or consequence.  In an extreme form, the idea of consequentialism is commonly encapsulated in the saying, "the end justifies the  ",  meaning that if a goal is morally important enough, any method of achieving it is acceptable.  Consequentialism is usually contrasted with deontological ethics (or deontology), in that deontology, in which rules and moral duty are central, derives the rightness or wrongness of one's conduct from the character of the behaviour itself rather than the outcomes of the conduct. 

Conscription<====>5735<====>Conscription  Conscription, sometimes draft, is the compulsory enlistment of people in a national service, most often a military service.Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names.  The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the French Revolution in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful military.  Most European nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 1–8 years on active duty and then transfer to the reserve force. 

Catherine Coleman<====>5736<====>Catherine Coleman  Catherine Grace "Cady" Coleman (born December 14, 1960) is an American chemist, a former United States Air Force officer, and a former NASA astronaut.She is a veteran of two Space Shuttle missions, and departed the International Space Station on May 23, 2011, as a crew member of Expedition 27 after logging 159 days in space. EducationColeman graduated from Wilbert Tucker Woodson High School, Fairfax, Virginia, in 1978;  in 1978–1979, she was an exchange student at Røyken upper secondary school in Norway with the AFS Intercultural Programs.  She received a bachelor of science degree in chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1983, and a doctorate in polymer science and engineering from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1991  as a member of the Air Force ROTC. 

Cervix<====>5738<====>Cervix   The cervix or cervix uteri ( ) is the lower part of the uterus in the human female reproductive system.  In a non-pregnant woman, the cervix is usually 2 to 3 cm long (~1 inch) and roughly cylindrical in shape.  The narrow, central cervical canal runs along its entire length, connecting the uterine cavity and the lumen of the vagina.  The opening into the uterus is called the internal os, and the opening into the vagina is called the external os.  The lower part of the cervix, known as the vaginal portion of the cervix (or ectocervix), bulges into the top of the vagina. 

Compiler<====>5739<====>CompilerA compiler is computer software that transforms computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another programming language (the target language).  Compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers.  The name compiler is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e. g. , assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program.  However, there are many different types of compilers.  If the compiled program can run on a computer whose CPU or operating system is different from the one on which the compiler runs, the compiler is a cross-compiler. 

Castrato<====>5742<====>Castrato A castrato (Italian, plural: castrati) is a type of classical male singing voice equivalent to that of a soprano, mezzo-soprano, or contralto.  The voice is produced by castration of the singer before puberty, or it occurs in one who, due to an endocrinological condition, never reaches sexual maturity. Castration before puberty (or in its early stages) prevents a boy's larynx from being transformed by the normal physiological events of puberty.  As a result, the vocal range of prepubescence (shared by both sexes) is largely retained, and the voice develops into adulthood in a unique way.  Prepubescent castration for this purpose diminished greatly in the late 18th century and was made illegal in Italy in 1870. 

Counting-out game<====>5743<====>Counting-out gameA counting-out game is a simple game intended to select a person to be "it", often for the purpose of playing another game.  These games usually require no materials, and are played with spoken words or hand gestures.  The historian Henry Carrington Bolton suggested in his 1888 book "Counting Out Rhymes of Children" that the custom of counting out originated in the "superstitious practice of divination by lot. "  Many such games involve one person pointing at each participant in a circle of players while reciting a rhyme.  A new person is pointed at as each word is said. 

Key size<====>5749<====>Key sizeIn cryptography, key size or key length is the number of bits in a key used by a cryptographic algorithm (such as a cipher). Key length defines the upper-bound on an algorithm's security (i. e. , a logarithmic measure of the fastest known attack against an algorithm, relative to the key length), since the security of all algorithms can be violated by brute force attacks.  Ideally, key length would coincide with the lower-bound on an algorithm's security.  Indeed, most symmetric-key algorithms are designed to have security equal to their key length.  However, after design, a new attack might be discovered. 

Cognitive behavioral therapy<====>5750<====>Cognitive behavioral therapy Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a psycho-social interventionthat is the most widely used evidence-based practice for improving mental health.Guided by empirical research, CBT focuses on the development of personal coping strategies that target solving current problems and changing unhelpful patterns in cognitions (e. g.  thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes), behaviors, and emotional regulation. It was originally designed to treat depression, and is now used for a number of mental health conditions.   The CBT model is based on the combination of the basic principles from behavioral and cognitive psychology . 

Chinese language<====>5751<====>Chinese languageChinese ( ; or  ) is a group of related, but in many cases mutually unintelligible, language varieties, forming a branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family.  Chinese is spoken by the Han majority and many other ethnic groups in China.  Nearly 1. 2 billion people (around 16% of the world's population) speak some form of Chinese as their first language. The varieties of Chinese are usually described by native speakers as dialects of a single Chinese language, but linguists note that they are as diverse as a language family.  The internal diversity of Chinese has been likened to that of the Romance languages, but may be even more varied. 

Complex analysis<====>5759<====>Complex analysis  Complex analysis, traditionally known as the theory of functions of a complex variable, is the branch of mathematical analysis that investigates functions of complex numbers.  It is useful in many branches of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, number theory, analytic combinatorics, applied mathematics; as well as in physics, including the branches of hydrodynamics, thermodynamics, and particularly quantum mechanics.  By extension, use of complex analysis also has applications in engineering fields such as nuclear, aerospace, mechanical and electrical engineering. As a differentiable function of a complex variable is equal to the sum of its Taylor series (that is, it is analytic), complex analysis is particularly concerned with analytic functions of a complex variable (that is, holomorphic functions). 

History of China<====>5760<====>History of ChinaWritten records of the history of China date from as early as 1500 BC, William G.  Boltz, Early Chinese Writing, World Archaeology, Vol.  17, No.  3, Early Writing Systems.  (Feb. , 1986), pp.  420–436 (436).    from the Shang dynasty (c.  1600–1046 BC).Ancient historical texts such as the Records of the Grand Historian (c.  100 BC) and the Bamboo Annals (296 BC) describe a Xia dynasty (c.  2070–1600 BC) before the Shang, but no writing on a durable medium have survived. 

Civil engineering<====>5762<====>Civil engineering   Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including works like roads, bridges, canals, dams, and buildings.    Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines.  It is the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering,    and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering.Civil engineering takes place in the public sector from municipal through to national governments, and in the private sector from individual homeowners through to international companies. 

Çatalhöyük<====>5765<====>Çatalhöyük  Çatalhöyük ( ; also Çatal Höyük and Çatal Hüyük; from Turkish çatal "fork" + höyük "mound") was a very large Neolithic and Chalcolithic proto-city settlement in southern Anatolia, which existed from approximately 7500 BC to 5700 BC, and flourished around 7000 BC.In July 2012, it was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Çatalhöyük is located overlooking the Konya Plain, southeast of the present-day city of Konya (ancient Iconium) in Turkey, approximately 140 km (87 mi) from the twin-coned volcano of Mount Hasan.  The eastern settlement forms a mound which would have risen about 20 m (66 ft) above the plain at the time of the latest Neolithic occupation. 

Clement Attlee<====>5766<====>Clement Attlee    Clement Richard Attlee, 1st Earl Attlee,    (3 January 1883 – 8 October 1967) was a British statesman of the Labour Party who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1945 to 1951 and Leader of the Labour Party from 1935 to 1955.  In 1940, Attlee took Labour into the wartime coalition government and served under Winston Churchill, becoming the first person to hold the office of Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.  He went on to lead the Labour Party to an unexpected landslide victory at the 1945 general election; forming the first Labour majority government and a mandate to implement its postwar reforms. 

Catullus<====>5768<====>CatullusGaius Valerius Catullus ( , ( ; c.  84 – 54? BC) was a Latin poet of the late Roman Republic who wrote in the neoteric style of poetry, which is about personal life rather than classical heroes.  His surviving works are still read widely and continue to influence poetry and other forms of art. Catullus's poems were widely appreciated by other poets.  He greatly influenced Ovid, Horace, Virgil, and others.  After his rediscovery in the Late Middle Ages, Catullus again found admirers.  His explicit writing style has shocked many readers. 

C. S. Forester<====>5769<====>C.  S.  Forester  Cecil Louis Troughton Smith (27 August 1899 – 2 April 1966), known by his pen name Cecil Scott "C.  S. " Forester, was an English novelist known for writing tales of naval warfare such as the 12-book Horatio Hornblower series, depicting a Royal Navy officer during the Napoleonic wars.   Two of the Hornblower books, A Ship of the Line and Flying Colours, were jointly awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction in 1938.   His other works include The African Queen (1935; filmed in 1951 by John Huston). 

List of country calling codes<====>5770<====>List of country calling codesCountry calling codes or country dial in codes are telephone dialing prefixes for the member countries or regions of the  International Telecommunication Union (ITU).  They are defined by the ITU-T in standards E. 123 and E. 164.  The prefixes enable international direct dialing (IDD), and are also referred to as international subscriber dialing (ISD) codes. Country codes are a component of the international telephone numbering plan, and are necessary only when dialing a telephone number to establish a call to another country.  Country codes are dialed before the national telephone number.  By convention, international telephone numbers are represented by prefixing the country code with a plus sign (+), which also indicates to the subscriber that the local international call prefix must first be dialed. 

Christopher Marlowe<====>5771<====>Christopher MarloweChristopher Marlowe,  also known as Kit Marlowe (baptised 26 February 1564 30 May 1593), was an English playwright, poet and translator of the Elizabethan era.  Marlowe was the foremost Elizabethan tragedian of his day.   He greatly influenced William Shakespeare, who was born in the same year as Marlowe and who rose to become the pre-eminent Elizabethan playwright after Marlowe's mysterious early death.  Marlowe's plays are known for the use of blank verse and their overreaching protagonists. A warrant was issued for Marlowe's arrest on 18 May 1593.  No reason was given for it, though it was thought to be connected to allegations of blasphemy—a manuscript believed to have been written by Marlowe was said to contain "vile heretical conceipts". 

Caving<====>5776<====>Caving  Caving –  also traditionally known as spelunking in the United States and Canada and potholing in the United Kingdom and Ireland – is the recreational pastime of exploring wild (generally non-commercial) cave systems.  In contrast, speleology is the scientific study of caves and the cave environment.  Caving in New Zealand (from Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, Accessed 2012-11. ) The challenges involved in caving vary according to the cave being visited, but – in addition to the total absence of light beyond the entrance – often include the negotiation of pitches, squeezes,  and water hazards. 

Cave<====>5778<====>Cave  A cave is a hollow place in the ground,   specifically a natural underground space large enough for a human to enter.  Caves form naturally by the weathering of rock and often extend deep underground.  The word cave can also refer to much smaller openings such as sea caves, rock shelters, and grottos, though strictly speaking a cave is exogene, meaning it is deeper than its opening is wide,  and a rock shelter is endogene.   A cavern is a specific type of cave, naturally formed in soluble rock with the ability to grow speleothems. 

Chinese numerals<====>5781<====>Chinese numerals  Chinese numerals are words and characters used to denote numbers in Chinese. Today, speakers of Chinese use three written numeral systems: the system of Arabic numerals used worldwide, and two indigenous systems.  The more familiar indigenous system is based on Chinese characters that correspond to numerals in the spoken language.  These are shared with other languages of the Chinese cultural sphere such as Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese.  Most people and institutions in China and Taiwan primarily use the Arabic or mixed Arabic-Chinese systems for convenience, with traditional Chinese numerals used in finance, mainly for writing amounts on checks, banknotes, some ceremonial occasions, some boxes, and on commercials. 

Computer program<====>5783<====>Computer program A computer program is a collection of instructions    that performs a specific task when executed by a computer.  A computer requires programs to function. A computer program is usually written by a computer programmer in a programming language.  From the program in its human-readable form of source code, a compiler can derive machine code—a form consisting of instructions that the computer can directly execute.  Alternatively, a computer program may be executed with the aid of an interpreter. A part of a computer program that performs a well-defined task is known as an algorithm. 

Crime<====>5785<====>Crime    In ordinary language, a crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority.The term "crime" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, Farmer, Lindsay: "Crime, definitions of", in Cane and Conoghan (editors), The New Oxford Companion to Law, Oxford University Press, 2008 ( ), page 263 (Google Books).   though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes.   The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. 

California Institute of Technology<====>5786<====>California Institute of Technology   The California Institute of Technology (abbreviated Caltech) The university itself only spells its short form as "Caltech"; other spellings such as "Cal Tech" and "CalTech" are incorrect.  The Institute is also occasionally referred to as "CIT", most notably in its alma mater, but this is uncommon.   is a private doctorate-granting university located in Pasadena, California, United States. Although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G.  Throop in 1891, the college attracted influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale, Arthur Amos Noyes and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century. 

Carlo Goldoni<====>5790<====>Carlo Goldoni   Carlo Osvaldo Goldoni ( ; 25 February 1707 – 6 February 1793) was an Italian playwright and librettist from the Republic of Venice.  His works include some of Italy's most famous and best-loved plays.  Audiences have admired the plays of Goldoni for their ingenious mix of wit and honesty.  His plays offered his contemporaries images of themselves, often dramatizing the lives, values, and conflicts of the emerging middle classes.  Though he wrote in French and Italian, his plays make rich use of the Venetian language, regional vernacular, and colloquialisms.  Goldoni also wrote under the pen name and title "Polisseno Fegeio, Pastor Arcade," which he claimed in his memoirs the "Arcadians of Rome" bestowed on him. 

Cumulative distribution function<====>5793<====>Cumulative distribution function  In probability theory and statistics, the cumulative distribution function (CDF, also cumulative density function) of a real-valued random variable X, or just distribution function of X, evaluated at x, is the probability that X will take a value less than or equal to x. In the case of a continuous distribution, it gives the area under the probability density function from minus infinity to x.   Cumulative distribution functions are also used to specify the distribution of multivariate random variables. DefinitionThe cumulative distribution function of a real-valued random variable X is the function  given by F_X(x) = \operatorname{P}(X\leq x), where the right-hand side represents the probability that the random variable X takes on a value less than orequal to x. 

Central tendency<====>5794<====>Central tendency In statistics, a central tendency (or measure of central tendency) is a central or typical value for a probability distribution.  Weisberg H. F (1992) Central Tendency and Variability, Sage University Paper Series on Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences,    p. 2  It may also be called a center or location of the distribution.  Colloquially, measures of central tendency are often called averages.  The term central tendency dates from the late 1920s.  The most common measures of central tendency are the arithmetic mean, the median and the mode.  A central tendency can be calculated for either a finite set of values or for a theoretical distribution, such as the normal distribution. 

Celebrity<====>5796<====>Celebrity  Celebrity refers to the fame and public attention accorded by the mass media to individuals or groups or, occasionally, animals, but is usually applied to the persons or groups of people (celebrity couples, families, etc. ) themselves who receive such a status of fame and attention.  Celebrity status is often associated with wealth (commonly referred to as fame and fortune), while fame often provides opportunities to earn revenue. Successful careers in sports and entertainment are commonly associated with celebrity status,  while political leaders often become celebrities.  People may also become celebrities due to media attention on their lifestyle, wealth, or controversial actions, or for their connection to a famous person. 

Cluster sampling<====>5797<====>Cluster samplingCluster sampling is a sampling plan used when mutually homogeneous yet internally heterogeneous groupings are evident in a statistical population.   It is often used in marketing research.  In this sampling plan, the total population is divided into these groups (known as clusters) and a simple random sample of the groups is selected.  The elements in each cluster are then sampled.  If all elements in each sampled cluster are sampled, then this is referred to as a "one-stage" cluster sampling plan.  If a simple random subsample of elements is selected within each of these groups, this is referred to as a "two-stage" cluster sampling plan. 

Charles Baudelaire<====>5804<====>Charles Baudelaire    Charles Pierre Baudelaire ( ;   ; April 9, 1821 – August 31, 1867) was a French poet who also produced notable work as an essayist, art critic, and pioneering translator of Edgar Allan Poe. His most famous work, Les Fleurs du mal (The Flowers of Evil), expresses the changing nature of beauty in modern, industrializing Paris during the 19th century.  Baudelaire's highly original style of prose-poetry influenced a whole generation of poets including Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud and Stéphane Mallarmé among many others.  He is credited with coining the term "modernity" (modernité) to designate the fleeting, ephemeral experience of life in an urban metropolis, and art's responsibility to capture that experience. 

Casey at the Bat<====>5808<====>Casey at the Bat "Casey at the Bat: A Ballad of the Republic Sung in the Year 1888" is a baseball poem written in 1888 by Ernest Thayer.  First published in The San Francisco Examiner (then called The Daily Examiner) on June 3, 1888, it was later popularized by DeWolf Hopper in many vaudeville performances. It has become one of the best-known poems in American literature.   The poem was originally published anonymously (under the pen name "Phin", based on Thayer's college nickname, "Phinney").  SynopsisA baseball team from the fictional town of "Mudville" (implied to be the home team) is losing by two runs in its last inning. 

Classical guitar<====>5810<====>Classical guitar  The classical guitar (also known as concert guitar, classical acoustic, nylon-string guitar, or Spanish guitar) is the member of the guitar family used in classical music.  It is an acoustical wooden guitar with strings made of nylon, rather than the metal strings used in acoustic and electric guitars.  The traditional classical guitar has twelve frets clear of the body and is held on the left leg, so that the hand that plucks or strums the strings does so near the back of the soundhole (this is called the classical position).  The modern steel string guitar, on the other hand, usually has fourteen frets clear of the body (see Dreadnought) and is commonly played off the hip.

Chinese dominoes<====>5814<====>Chinese dominoesChinese dominoes are used in several tile-based games, namely, Tien Gow, Pai Gow, Tiu U and Kap Tai Shap.   In Cantonese they are called "Gwat Pai" (骨牌), which literally means "bone tiles"; it is also the name of a northern Chinese game, where the rules are quite different from the southern Chinese version of Tien Gow. HistoryMing author Xie Zhaozhe (1567–1624) records the legend of dominoes having been presented to Song Emperor Huizong in 1112.  However the contemporary Li Qingzhao (1084 – c.  1155) made no mention of dominoes in her compendium of games.  The oldest confirmed written mention of dominoes in China comes from the Former Events in Wulin (i. 

Cenozoic<====>5816<====>Cenozoic  The Cenozoic Era ( )    is the current geological era, covering the period from 66 million years ago to the present day. The Cenozoic is also known as the Age of Mammals, because of the large mammals that dominate it.  The continents also moved into their current positions during this era. NomenclatureCenozoic, meaning "new life," is derived from Greek   kainós "new," and   zōḗ "life. "    The era is also known as the Cænozoic, Caenozoic, or Cainozoic.   ;  DivisionsThe Cenozoic is divided into three periods: the Paleogene, Neogene, and Quaternary; and seven epochs: the Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene, Pliocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene. 

Confucianism<====>5820<====>Confucianism   Confucianism, also known as Ruism, is described as tradition, a philosophy, a religion, a humanistic or rationalistic religion, a way of governing, or simply a way of life.   Confucianism developed from what was later called the Hundred Schools of Thought from the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius (551–479 BCE), who considered himself a retransmitter of the values of the Zhou dynasty golden age of several centuries before.  Rickett, Guanzi - "all early Chinese political thinkers were basically committed to a reesteablishment of the golden age of the past as early Zhou propaganda described it. 

Chinese philosophy<====>5822<====>Chinese philosophy    Chinese philosophy originates in the Spring and Autumn period and Warring States period, during a period known as the "Hundred Schools of Thought",    which was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments.   Although much of Chinese philosophy begins in the Warring States period, elements of Chinese philosophy have existed for several thousand years; some can be found in the Yi Jing (the Book of Changes), an ancient compendium of divination, which dates back to at least 672 BCE. 

Confucius<====>5823<====>Confucius    Ancestral name (姓): Zi ( ; Pinyin: Zǐ) Clan name (氏): Kong (Ch: 孔; Py: Kǒng) Given name (名): Qiu (Ch: 丘; Py: Qiū) Courtesy name (字): Zhongni (Ch: 仲尼; Py: Zhōngní) Styled: Master Kong (Ch: 孔子; Py: Kǒngzǐ) Confucius (    ; September 28, 551 BC – 479 BC)   was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and philosopher of the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history. The philosophy of Confucius, also known as Confucianism, emphasized personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice and sincerity.  His followers competed successfully with many other schools during the Hundred Schools of Thought era only to be suppressed in favor of the Legalists during the Qin Dynasty. 

Complex number<====>5826<====>Complex numberA complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form  , where   and   are real numbers, and   is a solution of the equation  , which is called an imaginary number because there is no real number that satisfies this equation.   For the complex number  ,   is called the  , and   is called the  .   Despite the historical nomenclature "imaginary", complex numbers are regarded in the mathematical sciences as just as "real" as the real numbers, and are fundamental in many aspects of our description of the natural world. 

Cryptozoology<====>5828<====>Cryptozoology Cryptozoology is a pseudoscience that aims to prove the existence of entities from the folklore record, such as Bigfoot or chupacabras, as well as animals otherwise considered extinct, such as non-avian dinosaurs.  Cryptozoologists refer to these entities as cryptids.  Because it does not follow the scientific method, cryptozoology is considered a pseudoscience by the academic world: it is neither a branch of zoology nor folkloristics. Terminology, history, and approachAs a field, cryptozoology originates from  the works of colleagues Bernard Heuvelmans, a Belgian-French zoologist, and Ivan T.  Sanderson, a Scottish zoologist.  Notably, Heuvelmans published On the Track of Unknown Animals (French Sur la Piste des Bêtes Ignorées) in 1955, a landmark work among cryptozoologists that was followed by numerous other like works.

Colombia is bordered to the northwest by Panama; to the east by Venezuela and Brazil; to the south by Ecuador and Peru;    and it shares maritime limits with Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. 

Politics of Colombia<====>5838<====>Politics of Colombia  The Politics of Colombia take place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Colombia is both head of state and head of government, and of a  multi-party system.  Executive power is carried out by the government.  Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of congress, the Senate and the House of Representatives of Colombia.  The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.  The Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Colombia as "flawed democracy" in 2016.  Constitutional reformsColombia's present constitution, enacted on July 5, 1991, strengthened the administration of justice with the provision for introduction of an adversarial system which ultimately is to entirely replace the existing Napoleonic Code. 

Economy of Colombia<====>5839<====>Economy of Colombia    Colombia is Latin America's fourth largest and Middle America's second largest economy measured by gross domestic product.  Petroleum is Colombia's main export, making over 45% of Colombia's exports.  Manufacturing makes up nearly 12% of Colombia's exports, and grows at a rate of over 10% a year.  Colombia has the fastest growing information technology industry in the world and has the longest fibre optic network in Latin America.   Colombia also has one of the largest shipbuilding industries in the world outside Asia. Colombia over the last decade has experienced a historic economic boom. 

Communications in Colombia<====>5840<====>Communications in Colombia Since being liberalized in 1991, the Colombian telecommunications sector has added new services, expanded coverage, improved efficiency, and lowered costs.  The sector has had the second largest (after energy) investment in infrastructure (54 percent) since 1997.  However, the economic downturn between 1999 and 2002 adversely affected telecommunications.  During this period, Colombia’s telecommunications industry lost US$2 billion despite a profit of US$1 billion in local service.  In June 2003, the government liquidated the state-owned and heavily indebted National Telecommunications Company (Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones—Telecom) and replaced it with Colombia Telecomunicaciones (Colombia Telecom).  The measure enabled the industry to expand rapidly, and in 2004 it constituted 2. 

Transport in Colombia<====>5841<====>Transport in ColombiaTransport in Colombia is regulated by the Ministry of Transport. Road travel is the main means of transport; 69 percent of cargo is transported by road, as compared with 27 percent by railroad, 3 percent by internal waterways, and 1 percent by air.

HistoryIndigenous peoples influenceThe indigenous peoples in Colombia used and some continue to use the water ways as the way of transportation using rafts and canoes. Spanish influenceWith the arrival of the Europeans the Spaniards brought the horses, mules and donkey (which developed into the Paso Fino) used by them in ranching duties later in the Spanish colonization of the Americas. 

Military Forces of Colombia<====>5843<====>Military Forces of Colombia  The Military Forces of Colombia ( ) are the unified armed forces of the Republic of Colombia.   The Colombian military is the second largest in the Western Hemisphere in terms of active personnel, behind the United States Armed Forces.   The President of Colombia is the military's commander in chief, and helps formulate defence policy through the Ministry of National Defence (MinDefensa), which is in charge of day-to-day operations.   The Colombian military consists of the National Army of Colombia, Colombian Navy, Colombian Air Force and the Colombian Naval Infantry.  Although the National Police of Colombia is technically not part of the military, it is controlled and administered by the Ministry of Defense, and has a highly militarized structure not found in most of the world's law enforcement agencies, such as a distinction between enlisted and officer ranks, and the regular use of heavy military equipment. 

History of Colombia<====>5844<====>History of Colombia The history of Colombia includes the settlements and society by indigenous peoples, most notably, the Muisca Confederation, Quimbaya Civilization, and Tairona Chiefdoms; the Spanish arrived in 1499 and initiated a period of conquest and colonization, most noteworthy being Spanish conquest of the Muisca; ultimately creating the Viceroyalty of New Granada, with its capital at Bogotá.  Independence from Spain was won in 1819, but by 1830 the "Gran Colombia" Federation was dissolved.  What is now Colombia and Panama emerged as the Republic of New Granada.  The new nation experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation (1858), and then the United States of Colombia (1863), before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886. 

Foreign relations of Colombia<====>5845<====>Foreign relations of Colombia Colombia seeks diplomatic and commercial relations with all countries, regardless of their ideologies or political or economic systems.  For this reason, the Colombian economy is quite open, relying on international trade and following the guidelines given by international law. Since 2008, Colombia's Ministry of Trade and Commerce has either reached or strengthened Bilateral Trade Agreements with South Korea, Japan and China  building stronger commerce interchange and development in the Pacific Rim. Regional relations have also vastly improved under the Santos Administration (2010-current).  Issues however remain regarding spillover of the FARC leftist-terrorist group, being chased out of hiding in rural areas of Colombia and finding save-havens in non-monitored areas of bordering states. 

Geography of the Czech Republic<====>5846<====>Geography of the Czech RepublicThe geography of the Czech Republic is quite varied.  Bohemia, at the west part of Czech Republic, consists of a river basin, drained by the Elbe (Czech: Labe) and Vltava rivers.  It is surrounded by mostly low mountains such as the Sudetes with its part Krkonoše, containing the highest point in the country, the Sněžka at  .  Moravia, the eastern part, is also quite hilly and is drained predominantly by the Morava river, but also contains the source of the Oder (Czech: Odra) river.

Electrified railways generally have voltages of 3 kV DC or 25 kV AC.    of track is narrow gauge.  The most prominent Czech railway company is the state-owned České dráhy (ČD) (English: Czech Railways).  Prague has an underground rapid transit system, the Prague Metro.  In addition, the cities of Brno, Liberec, Most, Olomouc, Ostrava, Plzeň, and Prague have tram systems. 

Army of the Czech Republic<====>5853<====>Army of the Czech Republic  The Army of the Czech Republic ( , AČR), also known as the Czech Army or Czech Armed Forces, is the military service responsible for the defence of the Czech Republic in compliance with international obligations and treaties on collective defence.  It is also set to support peacekeeping, rescue and humanitarian operations both within the national territory and abroad.   Armed Forces consist of the General Staff, the Land Forces, the Air Force and support units.  From the late 1940s to 1989, the extensive Czechoslovak People's Army (about 200,000) formed one of the pillars of the Warsaw Pact military alliance. 

Foreign relations of the Czech Republic<====>5855<====>Foreign relations of the Czech Republic  The Czech Republic is a Central European country, a member of the European Union, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OSCE), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the United Nations (and all of its main specialized agencies and boards).  It entertains diplomatic relations with 191 countries of the world, around half of which maintain a resident embassy in the Czech capital city, Prague.  During the years 1948-1989, the foreign policy of Czechoslovakia had followed that of the Soviet Union.  Since the revolution and the subsequent mutually-agreed peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the Czechs have made reintegration with Western institutions their chief foreign policy objective. 

Climbing<====>5857<====>Climbing   Climbing is the activity of using one's hands, feet, or any other part of the body to ascend a steep object.  It is done recreationally, competitively, in trades that rely on it, and in emergency rescue and military operations.  It is done indoors and out, on natural and man-made structures. TypesClimbing activities include:Bouldering: Ascending boulders or small outcrops, often with climbing shoes and a chalk bag or bucket.  Usually, instead of using a safety rope from above, injury is avoided using a crash pad and a human spotter (to direct a falling climber on to the pad. 

Continuity Irish Republican Army<====>5859<====>Continuity Irish Republican Army   The Continuity Irish Republican Army, usually known as the Continuity IRA (CIRA) is an Irish republican paramilitary group that claims to be the armed forces of the Irish Republic that was proclaimed in 1916.  It aims to bring about a united Ireland.  It emerged from a split in the Provisional IRA in 1986 but did not become active until the Provisional IRA ceasefire of 1994.  It is an illegal organisation in the Republic of Ireland and is designated a terrorist organisation in the United Kingdom,  New Zealand    and the United States.

Copenhagen interpretation<====>5863<====>Copenhagen interpretationThe Copenhagen interpretation is an expression of the meaning of quantum mechanics that was largely devised in the years 1925 to 1927 by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg.  It remains one of the most commonly taught interpretations of quantum mechanics.    According to the Copenhagen interpretation, physical systems generally do not have definite properties prior to being measured, and quantum mechanics can only predict the probabilities that measurements will produce certain results.  The act of measurement affects the system, causing the set of probabilities to reduce to only one of the possible values immediately after the measurement. 

Customs union<====>5864<====>Customs union A customs union is a type of trade bloc which is composed of a free trade area with a common external tariff. The participant countries set up common external trade policy, but in some cases they use different import quotas. Common competition policy is also helpful to avoid competition deficiency.   Purposes for establishing a customs union normally include increasing economic efficiency and establishing closer political and cultural ties between the member countries.It is the third stage of economic integration.Customs unions are established through trade pacts.List of current customs unions (indicative) Agreement Date (in force) Recent reference Andean Community (CAN) 1988-05-25 L/6737 Caribbean Community (CARICOM) 1991-01-01  Central American Common Market (CACM) 2004-10-06 WT/REG93/R/B/2 East African Community (EAC) 2005-01-01   WT/COMTD/N/14 Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) 1999-06-01    Eurasian Customs Union (EACU)  2010-07-01    European Union Customs Union (EUCU; EU–Monaco)  1958    ∟ EU–Andorra Customs Union 1991-07-01 WT/REG53/M/3  ∟ EU–San Marino Customs Union  2002-04-01   ∟ EU–Turkey Customs Union  1996-01-01 WT/REG22/M/4 Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) 2015-01-01Israel–Palestinian Authority  1994Iqtisadi: The Israeli-Palestinian Economic Agreement and Current Consequences.Ephraim Lavie, Moshe Dayan Center–Tel Aviv University, January 2013  Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) 1991-11-29 WT/COMTD/1/Add.17 Southern African Customs Union (SACU) 1910  WT/REG231/3 Switzerland–Liechtenstein  (CH-FL) 1924  West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) 1994-01-10 WT/COMTD/N/11/Add.1 Note: Every Economic union, Customs and monetary union and Economic and monetary union includes a Customs Union.Additionally the autonomous and dependent territories, such as some of the EU member state special territories, are sometimes treated as separate customs territory from their mainland state or have varying arrangements of formal or de facto customs union, common market and currency union (or combinations thereof) with the mainland and in regards to third countries through the trade pacts signed by the mainland state.

Council of Europe<====>5865<====>Council of Europe    The Council of Europe (CoE;  ) is an international organisation whose stated aim  is to uphold human rights, democracy, rule of law in Europe  and promote European culture.   Founded in 1949, it has 47 member states, covers approximately 820 million people and operates with an annual budget of approximately half a billion euros.  The organisation is distinct from the 28-nation European Union (EU), although it is sometimes confused with it, partly because the EU has adopted the original European Flag which was created by the Council of Europe in 1955,  as well as the European Anthem. 

Council of the European Union<====>5866<====>Council of the European Union    The Council of the European Union (often still referred to as the Council of Ministers, or sometimes just called the Council ( ) is the third of the seven institutions of the European Union (EU) as listed in the Treaty on European Union.   It is part of the essentially bicameral EU legislature (the other legislative body being the European Parliament) and represents the executive governments of the EU's member states.    It is based in the Europa building in Brussels.    CompositionThe Council meets in 10 different configurations of 28 national ministers (one per state). 

Continental Europe<====>5867<====>Continental Europe    Continental or mainland Europe is the continuous continent of Europe excluding its surrounding islands.   It can also be referred to ambiguously as the European continent—which can conversely mean the whole of Europe—and by Europeans, simply the Continent. The most common definition of continental Europe excludes continental islands, encompassing the Greek Islands, Cyprus, Malta, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, the Balearic Islands, Ireland, Great Britain, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands, Novaya Zemlya and the Danish archipelago, as well as nearby oceanic islands, including the Canary Islands, Madeira, the Azores, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and Svalbard. 

Category theory<====>5869<====>Category theory Category theory  formalizes mathematical structure and its concepts in terms of a labeled directed graph called a category, whose nodes are called  objects, and whose labelled directed edges are called  arrows (or morphisms).  A category has two basic properties: the ability to compose the arrows associatively and the existence of an identity arrow for each object.  The language of category theory has been used to formalize concepts of other high-level abstractions such as sets, rings, and groups. Several terms used in category theory, including the term "morphism", are used differently from their uses in the rest of mathematics.

Bradycardia<====>5872<====>Bradycardia  Bradycardia is a condition wherein an individual has a slow heart rate, typically defined as a heart rate of under 60 beats per minute (BPM) in adults.   Bradycardia typically does not cause symptoms until the rate drops below 50 BPM.  When symptomatic, it may cause fatigue, weakness, dizziness, sweating, and at very low rates, fainting.  Sinus Bradycardia – eMedicine During sleep, a slow heartbeat with rates around 40–50 BPM is common, and is considered normal.   Highly trained athletes  may also have athletic heart syndrome, a very slow resting heart rate that occurs as a sport adaptation and helps prevent tachycardia during training. 

Canada Day<====>5873<====>Canada Day  Canada Day ( ) is the national day of Canada.  A federal statutory holiday, it celebrates the anniversary of the July 1, 1867, enactment of the Constitution Act, 1867 (then called the British North America Act, 1867), which united the three separate colonies of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick into a single Dominion within the British Empire called Canada.Originally called Dominion Day ( ), the holiday was renamed in 1982, the year the Canada Act was passed.  Canada Day celebrations take place throughout the country, as well as in various locations around the world, attended by Canadians living abroad. 

Claudine (book series)<====>5874<====>Claudine (book series)  The Claudine series consists of four early novels by the French author Colette, published 1900-1904.Written in diary form, they describe the growth to maturity of a young girl, Claudine.  Aged fifteen at the beginning of the first book, Claudine à l'école, the series describes her education and experiences as she grows up.   All the books are written in first-person with the first three having Claudine herself as the narrator.   The last in the series, Claudine s'en va, introduces a new narrator, Annie.  The novels were written in the late 19th century in collaboration with Colette's first husband, the writer Henry Gauthier-Villars, better known by his nom-de-plume "Willy". 

Coronary artery disease<====>5876<====>Coronary artery disease   Coronary artery disease (CAD), also known as ischemic heart disease (IHD),  refers to a group of diseases which includes stable angina, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death.It is within the group of cardiovascular diseases of which it is the most common type.A common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw.   Occasionally it may feel like heartburn.  Usually symptoms occur with exercise or emotional stress, last less than a few minutes, and improve with rest. 

Caesium<====>5879<====>Caesium  Caesium or cesium  is a chemical element with symbol Cs and atomic number 55.  It is a soft, silvery-gold alkali metal with a melting point of 28. 5 °C (83. 3 °F), which makes it one of only five elemental metals that are liquid at or near room temperature.   Caesium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of rubidium and potassium.  The most reactive of all metals, it is pyrophoric and reacts with water even at −116 °C (−177 °F).  It is the least electronegative element, with a value of 0. 79 on the Pauling scale.   It has only one stable isotope, caesium-133. 

Century<====>5881<====>Century  A century (from the Latin centum, meaning one hundred; abbreviated c.  ) is a period of 100 years.  Centuries are numbered ordinally in English and many other languages.   For example, "the 17th century" strictly refers to the years from 1601 to 1700, but popularly refers to be the years 1600 to 1699. A centenary is a hundredth anniversary or a celebration of this, typically the remembrance of an event which took place a hundred years earlier. Start and end in the Gregorian calendarAccording to the strict construction of the Gregorian calendar, the 1st century AD/CE started on January 1, 1, and ended on December 31, 100. 

Cardiff<====>5882<====>Cardiff   Cardiff ( ;    ) is the capital and largest city in Wales and the eleventh-largest city in the United Kingdom.  The city is the country's chief commercial centre, the base for most national cultural and sporting institutions, the Welsh national media, and the seat of the National Assembly for Wales.  The unitary authority area's 2016 population was estimated to be 361,468, https://statswales. gov. wales/Catalogue/Population-and-Migration/Population/Estimates/Local-Authority/populationestimates-by-localauthority-year  while the population of the Cardiff Capital Region (the ten local authorities of South East Wales) was estimated to be 1. 52M.  https://statswales. gov. wales/Catalogue/Population-and-Migration/Population/Estimates/Local-Authority/populationestimates-by-localauthority-year  Cardiff is a significant tourist centre and the most popular visitor destination in Wales with 18. 

Charles Dickens<====>5884<====>Charles DickensCharles John Huffam Dickens ( ; 7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic.  He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era.   .   His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the 20th century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius.  His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity.   Born in Portsmouth, Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors' prison. 

Carabiner<====>5898<====>Carabiner  A carabiner ( ) or karabiner is a specialized type of shackle, a metal loop with a spring-loaded gate  used to quickly and reversibly connect components, most notably in safety-critical systems.  The word is a shortened form of Karabinerhaken (or also short Karabiner), a German phrase for a "spring hook"  used by a carbine rifleman, or carabinier, to attach items to a belt or bandolier. The carabiner has been improved several times over the decades, making it more lightweight, reliable and durable.  UseCarabiners, or often called, D-Rings by military professionals, are widely used in rope-intensive activities such as climbing, arboriculture, caving, sailing, hot air ballooning, rope rescue, construction, industrial rope work, window cleaning, whitewater rescue, and acrobatics. 

Continuity (fiction)<====>5899<====>Continuity (fiction) In fiction, continuity (also called time-scheme) is consistency of the characteristics of people, plot, objects, and places seen by the reader or viewer over some period of time.  It is relevant to several media. Continuity is particularly a concern in the production of film and television due to the difficulty of rectifying an error in continuity after shooting has wrapped up.  It also applies to other art forms, including novels, comics, and video games, though usually on a smaller scale.   It also applies to fiction used by persons, corporations, and governments in the public eye. 

Capital punishment<====>5902<====>Capital punishment Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is a government-sanctioned practice whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime.  The sentence that someone be punished in such a manner is referred to as a death sentence, whereas the act of carrying out the sentence is known as an execution.  Crimes that are punishable by death are known as capital crimes or capital offences, and they commonly include offences such as murder, treason, espionage, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.  Etymologically, the term capital (lit. 

Cultural movement<====>5903<====>Cultural movement  A cultural movement is a change in the way a number of different disciplines approach their work.  This embodies all art forms, the sciences, and philosophies.  Historically, different nations or regions of the world have gone through their own independent sequence of movements in culture, but as world communications have accelerated this geographical distinction has become less distinct.  When cultural movements go through revolutions from one to the next, genres tend to get attacked and mixed up, and often new genres are generated and old ones fade.  These changes are often reactions against the prior cultural form, which typically has grown stale and repetitive. 

Chalcogen<====>5905<====>Chalcogen   The chalcogens ( ) are the chemical elements in group 16 of the periodic table.  This group is also known as the oxygen family.  It consists of the elements oxygen (O), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), and the radioactive element polonium (Po).  The chemically uncharacterized synthetic element livermorium (Lv) is predicted to be a chalcogen as well.Often, oxygen is treated separately from the other chalcogens, sometimes even excluded from the scope of the term "chalcogen" altogether, due to its very different chemical behavior from sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium. 

Carbon dioxide<====>5906<====>Carbon dioxide    Carbon dioxide (chemical formula  ) is a colorless gas with a density about 50% higher than that of dry air.   Carbon dioxide consists of a carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms.  It occurs naturally in Earth's atmosphere as a trace gas at a concentration of about 0. 04 percent (400 ppm) by volume.  Natural sources include volcanoes, hot springs and geysers, and it is freed from carbonate rocks by dissolution in water and acids.  Because carbon dioxide is soluble in water, it occurs naturally in groundwater, rivers and lakes, ice caps, glaciers and seawater. 

Cheers<====>5907<====>Cheers   Cheers is an American sitcom that ran on NBC from September 30, 1982, to May 20, 1993, with a total of 275 half-hour episodes spanning over eleven seasons.  The show was produced by Charles/Burrows/Charles Productions in association with Paramount Network Television.  The show was created by the team of James Burrows, Glen Charles, and Les Charles.  The show is set in a bar named Cheers in Boston, Massachusetts, where a group of locals meet to drink, relax, and socialize.  The show's main theme song, co-written and performed by Gary Portnoy, lent its refrain "Where Everybody Knows Your Name" as the show's catchphrase. 

Counterpoint<====>5909<====>Counterpoint  In music, counterpoint is the relationship between voices that are harmonically interdependent (polyphony) yet independent in rhythm and contour.    It has been most commonly identified in the European classical tradition, strongly developing during the Renaissance and in much of the common practice period, especially in the Baroque.  The term originates from the Latin punctus contra punctum meaning "point against point". General principlesCounterpoint generally involves musical lines with strongly independent identities.   Counterpoint has been used to designate a voice or even an entire composition.   In each era, contrapuntally organized music writing has been subject to rules—sometimes strict ones. 

Cyanide<====>5910<====>Cyanide   A cyanide is a chemical compound that contains the group C≡N.  This group, known as the cyano group, consists of a carbon atom triple-bonded to a nitrogen atom.  In inorganic cyanides, the cyanide group is present as the anion CN − .   For the salts such as sodium cyanide and potassium cyanide, these compounds are highly toxic.Hydrocyanic acid, also known as hydrogen cyanide, or HCN, is a highly volatile liquid that is produced on a large scale industrially.   It is obtained by acidification of cyanide salts. 

Carbonate<====>5912<====>Carbonate  In chemistry, a carbonate is a salt of carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3 ),    characterized by the presence of the carbonate ion, a polyatomic ion with the formula of  .  The name may also mean an ester of carbonic acid,  an organic compound containing the carbonate group C(=O)(O–) 2 . The term is also used as a verb, to describe carbonation: the process of raising the concentrations of carbonate and bicarbonate ions in water to produce carbonated water and other carbonated beverages either by the addition of carbon dioxide gas under pressure, or by dissolving carbonate or bicarbonate salts into the water. 

Catalysis<====>5914<====>Catalysis Catalysis ( ) is the increase in the rate of a chemical reaction due to the participation of an additional substance called a catalyst    ( ), which is not consumed in the catalyzed reaction and can continue to act repeatedly.  Often only tiny amounts of catalyst are required in principle.  In general, reactions occur faster with a catalyst because they require less activation energy.  In catalyzed mechanisms, the catalyst usually reacts to form a temporary intermediate which then regenerates the original catalyst in a cyclic process. Catalysts may be classified as either homogeneous or heterogeneous. 

Circumference<====>5916<====>Circumference In geometry, the circumference (from Latin circumferentia, meaning "carrying around") of a circle is the (linear) distance around it.   That is, the circumference would be the length of the circle if it were opened up and straightened out to a line segment.  Since a circle is the edge (boundary) of a disk, circumference is a special case of perimeter.   The perimeter is the length around any closed figure and is the term used for most figures excepting the circle and some circular-like figures such as ellipses. Informally, "circumference" may also refer to the edge itself rather than to the length of the edge. 

Continuum mechanics<====>5918<====>Continuum mechanics  Continuum mechanics is a branch of mechanics that deals with the analysis of the kinematics and the mechanical behavior of materials modeled as a continuous mass rather than as discrete particles.  The French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy was the first to formulate such models in the 19th century. Explanation Modeling an object as a continuum assumes that the substance of the object completely fills the space it occupies.  Modeling objects in this way ignores the fact that matter is made of atoms, and so is not continuous; however, on length scales much greater than that of inter-atomic distances, such models are highly accurate. 

Constitutional law<====>5919<====>Constitutional law Constitutional law is a body of law which defines the role, powers, and structure of different entities within a state, namely, the executive, the parliament or legislature, and the judiciary; as well as the basic rights of citizens and, in federal countries such as the United States and Canada, the relationship between the central government and state, provincial, or territorial governments. Not all nation states have codified constitutions, though all such states have a jus commune, or law of the land, that may consist of a variety of imperative and consensual rules.  These may include customary law, conventions, statutory law, judge-made law, or international rules and norms. 

Celtic languages<====>5920<====>Celtic languages   The Celtic languages (usually pronounced   but sometimes  )  are descended from Proto-Celtic, or "Common Celtic"; a branch of the greater Indo-European language family.   The term "Celtic" was first used to describe this language group by Edward Lhuyd in 1707,  following Paul-Yves Pezron who had already made the explicit link between the Celts described by classical writers and the Welsh and Breton languages.  Modern Celtic languages are mostly spoken on the north-western edge of Europe, notably in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Brittany, Cornwall, and the Isle of Man.  There are also a substantial number of Welsh speakers in the Patagonia area of Argentina and some speakers of Scottish Gaelic on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. 

Color<====>5921<====>Color    Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color categories, with names such as red, blue, yellow, green, orange, or purple.  This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light.  Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them.  This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. By defining a color space, colors can be identified numerically by coordinates. 

Computation<====>5926<====>Computation  Computation is any type of calculation   that includes both arithmetical and non-arithmetical steps and follows a well-defined model understood and described as, for example, an algorithm. The study of computation is paramount to the discipline of computer science. Physical phenomenonA computation can be seen as a purely physical phenomenon occurring inside a closed physical system called a computer. Examples of such physical systems include digital computers, mechanical computers, quantum computers, DNA computers, molecular computers, microfluidics-based computers, analog computers or wetware computers. This point of view is the one adopted by the branch of theoretical physics called the physics of computation as well as the field of natural computing. 

Clown<====>5928<====>Clown    Clowns are comic performers who employ slapstick or similar types of physical comedy, often in a mime style. HistoryClowns have a varied tradition with significant variations in costume and performance.  The most recognisable modern clown character is the Auguste or "red clown" type, with outlandish costumes featuring distinctive makeup, colourful wigs, exaggerated footwear, and colourful clothing.  Their entertainment style is generally designed to entertain large audiences, especially at a distance.  Modern clowns are strongly associated with the tradition of the circus clown, which developed out of earlier comedic roles in theatre or Varieté shows during the 19th to mid 20th centuries. 

Coffea<====>5930<====>Coffea    Coffea is a genus of flowering plants whose seeds, called coffee beans, are used to make various coffee beverages and products.  It is a member of the family Rubiaceae.  They are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and southern Africa and tropical Asia.  Coffee ranks as one of the world's most valuable and widely traded commodity crops and is an important export product of several countries, including those in Central and South America, the Caribbean and Africa. Cultivation and useSeveral species of Coffea may be grown for the seeds.  Coffea arabica accounts for 75–80 percent of the world's coffee production, while Coffea canephora accounts for about 20 percent. 

Cycling<====>5931<====>Cycling Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of bicycles for transport, recreation, exercise or sport.   People engaged in cycling are referred to as "cyclists",  "bikers",  or less commonly, as "bicyclists".   Apart from two-wheeled bicycles, "cycling" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadracycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs). Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide.   They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world. Cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and efficient mode of transportation   optimal for short to moderate distances. 

Carbohydrate<====>5932<====>Carbohydrate  A carbohydrate is a biological molecule consisting of carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) atoms, usually with a hydrogen–oxygen atom ratio of 2:1 (as in water); in other words, with the empirical formula   (where m could be different from n).   This formula holds true for monosaccharides.  Some exceptions exist; for example, deoxyribose, a sugar component of DNA,  has the empirical formula C 5 H 10 O 4 .   Carbohydrates are technically hydrates of carbon;    structurally it is more accurate to view them as polyhydroxy aldehydes and ketones. 

CSS Virginia<====>5933<====>CSS Virginia  }   CSS Virginia was the first steam-powered ironclad warship built by the Confederate States Navy during the first year of the American Civil War; she was constructed as a casemate ironclad using the raised and cut down original lower hull and engines of the scuttled steam frigate  .  Virginia was one of the participants in the Battle of Hampton Roads, opposing the Union's   in March 1862.  The battle is chiefly significant in naval history as the first battle between ironclads. USS Merrimack becomes CSS VirginiaWhen the Commonwealth of Virginia seceded from the Union in 1861, one of the important federal military bases threatened was Gosport Navy Yard (now Norfolk Naval Shipyard) in Portsmouth, Virginia. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints<====>5935<====>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day SaintsThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (known as the LDS Church or, informally, the Mormon Church) is a Nontrinitarian, Christian restorationist church that is considered by its members to be the restoration of the original church founded by Jesus Christ.  The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and has established congregations and built temples worldwide.  According to the church, it has over 70,000 missionaries "2016 Statistical Report for 2017 April Conference", Mormon Newsroom, April 1, 2017.   and a membership of nearly 16 million. 

Chemical thermodynamics<====>5936<====>Chemical thermodynamicsChemical thermodynamics is the study of the interrelation of heat and work with chemical reactions or with physical changes of state within the confines of the laws of thermodynamics.  Chemical thermodynamics involves not only laboratory measurements of various thermodynamic properties, but also the application of mathematical methods to the study of chemical questions and the spontaneity of processes. The structure of chemical thermodynamics is based on the first two laws of thermodynamics.   Starting from the first and second laws of thermodynamics, four equations called the "fundamental equations of Gibbs" can be derived.   From these four, a multitude of equations, relating the thermodynamic properties of the thermodynamic system can be derived using relatively simple mathematics. 

Standard works<====>5938<====>Standard worksThe standard works of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) are the four books that currently constitute its open scriptural canon.  (The scriptural canon is "open" due to the LDS belief in continuous revelation.  Additions can be made to the scriptural canon with the "common consent" of the church's membership.  ) The four books of the standard works are:The Holy Bible (King James version) (the LDS Church uses the King James Version (KJV) in English-speaking countries; other versions are used in non-English speaking countries)Scott Taylor, "LDS Church publishes new Spanish-language Bible", Deseret News, 13 September 2009. 

History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints<====>5942<====>History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints The history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is typically divided into three broad time periods: the early history during the lifetime of Joseph Smith which is in common with all Latter Day Saint movement churches, a "pioneer era" under the leadership of Brigham Young and his 19th-century successors, and a modern era beginning around the turn of the 20th century as the practice of polygamy was discontinued. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints traces its origins to western New York, where Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, was raised. 

Christian eschatology<====>5943<====>Christian eschatology  Christian eschatology is a major branch of study within Christian theology dealing with the "last things. " Eschatology, from two Greek words meaning "last" (ἔσχατος) and "study" (-λογία), is the study of 'end things', whether the end of an individual life, the end of the age, the end of the world and the nature of the Kingdom of God.  Broadly speaking, Christian eschatology is the study concerned with the ultimate destiny of the individual soul and the entire created order, based primarily upon biblical texts within the Old and New Testament. Christian eschatology looks to study and discuss matters such as death and the afterlife, Heaven and Hell, the Second Coming of Jesus, the resurrection of the dead, the Rapture, the Tribulation, Millennialism, the end of the world, the Last Judgment, and the New Heaven and New Earth in the world to come. 

Chicago White Sox<====>5945<====>Chicago White SoxThe Chicago White Sox are an American professional baseball team based in Chicago.  The White Sox compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) Central division.  Home games are held at Guaranteed Rate Field, located on the city's South Side, and the team is owned by Jerry Reinsdorf.  They are one of two major league clubs in Chicago; the other is the Chicago Cubs, who are a member of the National League (NL) Central division. One of the American League's eight charter franchises, the franchise was established as a major league baseball club in  . 

Casuistry<====>5946<====>Casuistry  Casuistry ( ) is a method in applied ethics and jurisprudence, often characterised as a critique of principle- or rule-based reasoning.   The word "casuistry" is derived from the Latin casus (meaning "case"). Casuistry is reasoning used to resolve moral problems by extracting or extending theoretical rules from particular instances and applying these rules to new instances.  The term is also commonly used as a pejorative to criticize the use of clever but unsound reasoning (alleging implicitly the inconsistent—or outright specious—application of rule to instance), especially in relation to moral questions (see sophistry). The agreed meaning of "casuistry" is in flux. 

Chinese input methods for computers<====>5948<====>Chinese input methods for computers Chinese input methods are methods that allow a computer user to input Chinese characters.  Most, if not all, Chinese input methods fall into one of two categories: phonetic readings or root shapes.  Methods under the phonetic category usually are easier to learn but are less efficient, thus resulting in slower typing speeds because they typically require users to choose from a list of phonetically similar characters for input; whereas methods under the root shape category allow very precise and speedy input but have a difficult learning curve because they often require a thorough understanding of a character's strokes and composition. 

Columbus, Ohio<====>5950<====>Columbus, Ohio  Columbus (   ) is the state capital and the most populous city of the U. S.  state of Ohio.  It is the 14th-most populous city in the United States,   "columbus-population-keeps-rising" Columbus Dispatch.  2014.    with a population of 860,090 as of 2016 estimates.

Located along Lake Erie, the city proper has a population of 388,072, making Cleveland the 51st largest city in the United States,  and the second-largest city in Ohio after Columbus.    Greater Cleveland ranked as the 32nd-largest metropolitan area in the United States, with 2,055,612 people in 2016.The city anchors the Cleveland–Akron–Canton Combined Statistical Area, which had a population of 3,515,646 in 2010 and ranks 15th in the United States. 

Church of England<====>5955<====>Church of England The Church of England (C of E) is the state church of England. The Archbishop of Canterbury (currently Justin Welby) is the most senior cleric, although the monarch is the supreme governor.  The Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion.  It traces its history to the Christian church recorded as existing in the Roman province of Britain by the third century, and to the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury. 

Circe<====>5956<====>Circe    Circe ( ; (  Kírkē  ) is a goddess of magic or sometimes a nymph, witch, enchantress or sorceress in Greek mythology.  By most accounts, she was the daughter of the sun god Helios, and Perse, an Oceanid nymph.  Her brothers were Aeetes, keeper of the Golden Fleece, and Perses.  Her sister was Pasiphaë, the wife of King Minos and mother of the Minotaur.   Other accounts make her the daughter of Hecate, the goddess of witchcraft.  Circe was renowned for her vast knowledge of potions and herbs.  Through the use of these and a magic wand or staff, she transformed her enemies, or those who offended her, into wild beasts. 

Canadian Pacific Railway<====>5959<====>Canadian Pacific Railway    The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), also known formerly as CP Rail   between 1968 and 1996, is a historic Canadian Class I railroad incorporated in 1881.  The railroad is owned by Canadian Pacific Railway Limited, which began operations as legal owner in a corporate restructuring in 2001.  Headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, it owns approximately   of track all across Canada and into the United States,    stretching from Montreal to Vancouver, and as far north as Edmonton.  Its rail network also serves  Minneapolis-St.  Paul, Milwaukee, Detroit, Chicago, and New York City in the United States. 

Cognitive psychology<====>5961<====>Cognitive psychology   Cognitive psychology is the study of mental processes such as "attention, language use, memory, perception, problem solving, creativity, and thinking".   Much of the work derived from cognitive psychology has been integrated into various other modern disciplines of psychological study, including educational psychology, social psychology, personality psychology, abnormal psychology, developmental psychology, and economics. HistoryPhilosophically, ruminations of the human mind and its processes have been around since the times of the ancient Greeks.  In 387 BCE, Plato is known to have suggested that the brain was the seat of the mental processes.   In 1637, René Descartes posited that humans are born with innate ideas, and forwarded the idea of mind-body dualism, which would come to be known as substance dualism (essentially the idea that the mind and the body are two separate substances).

This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail.  These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. 

Compost<====>5966<====>Compost  Compost (  or  ) is organic matter that has been decomposed and recycled as a fertilizer and soil amendment.  Compost is a key ingredient in organic farming. At the simplest level, the process of composting requires making a heap of wet organic matter known as green waste (leaves, food waste) and waiting for the materials to break down into humus after a period of weeks or months.  Modern, methodical composting is a multi-step, closely monitored process with measured inputs of water, air, and carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials.  The decomposition process is aided by shredding the plant matter, adding water and ensuring proper aeration by regularly turning the mixture. 

Corundum<====>5974<====>Corundum  Corundum is a crystalline form of aluminium oxide ( ) typically containing traces of iron, titanium, vanadium and chromium.    It is a rock-forming mineral.  It is a naturally transparent material, but can have different colors when impurities are present.  Transparent specimens are used as gems, called ruby if red and padparadscha if pink-orange.  All other colors are called sapphire, e. g. , green sapphire for a green specimen. The name "corundum" is derived from the Tamil word Kurundam, which originates from the Sanskrit word  Kuruvinda  meaning ruby.  Because of corundum's hardness (pure corundum is defined to have 9. 

Capoeira<====>5976<====>Capoeira  Capoeira ( ) is an Afro-Brazilian martial art that combines elements of dance, acrobatics  and music.    It was developed in Brazil mainly by Angolans, at the beginning of the 16th century.  It is known for its quick and complex maneuvers, predominantly using power, speed, and leverage across a wide variety of kicks, spins and other techniques. The most widely accepted origin of the word capoeira comes from the Tupi words ka'a ("jungle") e pûer ("it was") , referring to the areas of low vegetation in the Brazilian interior where fugitive slaves would hide. 

Carbon sink<====>5980<====>Carbon sink A carbon sink is a natural or artificial reservoir that accumulates and stores some carbon-containing chemical compound for an indefinite period.  The process by which carbon sinks remove carbon dioxide ( ) from the atmosphere is known as carbon sequestration.  Public awareness of the significance of CO 2  sinks has grown since passage of the Kyoto Protocol, which promotes their use as a form of carbon offset.  There are also different strategies used to enhance this process.  GeneralThe natural sinks are:Absorption of carbon dioxide by the oceans via physicochemical and biological processesPhotosynthesis by terrestrial plantsNatural sinks are typically much bigger than artificial sinks. 

Charles Tupper<====>5981<====>Charles Tupper   Sir Charles Tupper, 1st Baronet,   (July 2, 1821 – October 30, 1915) was a Canadian father of Confederation:  as the Premier of Nova Scotia from 1864 to 1867, he led Nova Scotia into Confederation.  He went on to serve as the sixth Prime Minister of Canada, sworn into office on May 1, 1896, seven days after parliament had been dissolved.  He lost the June 23 election and resigned on July 8, 1896.  His 69-day term as prime minister is currently the shortest in Canadian history. Tupper was born in Amherst, Nova Scotia to the Rev. 

Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission<====>5985<====>Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission    The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC,  ) is a public organisation in Canada with mandate as a regulatory agency for broadcasting and telecommunications.  It was created in 1976 when it took over responsibility for regulating telecommunication carriers.  Prior to 1976, it was known as the Canadian Radio and Television Commission, which was established in 1968 by the Parliament of Canada to replace the Board of Broadcast Governors.  Its headquarters is located in the Central Building (Édifice central) of Les Terrasses de la Chaudière in Gatineau, Quebec.  HistoryThe CRTC was originally known as the Canadian Radio-Television Commission. 

Coal<====>5987<====>Coal    Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock usually occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal beds  or coal seams.  The harder forms, such as anthracite coal, can be regarded as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure.  Coal is composed primarily of carbon, along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen.   Coal is a fossil fuel that forms when dead plant matter is converted into peat, which in turn is converted into lignite, then sub-bituminous coal, after that bituminous coal, and lastly anthracite. 

Traditional Chinese medicine<====>5992<====>Traditional Chinese medicine    Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM;  ) is a style of traditional medicine built on a foundation of more than 2,500 years of Chinese medical practice that includes various forms of herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage (tui na), exercise (qigong), and dietary therapy,  but recently also influenced by modern Western medicine.  TCM is widely used in Greater China(where it has long been the standard system of medicine), and is becoming increasingly popular and recognized worldwide (where it is primarily used as complementary alternative medicine approach).   One of the basic tenets of TCM is that "the body's vital energy (chi or qi) circulates through channels, called meridians, that have branches connected to bodily organs and functions. 

Chemical bond<====>5993<====>Chemical bondA chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms, ions or molecules that enables the formation of chemical compounds.  The bond may result from the electrostatic force of attraction between oppositely charged ions as in ionic bonds; or through the sharing of electrons as in covalent bonds.  The strength of chemical bonds varies considerably; there are "strong bonds" or "primary bond" such as metallic, covalent or ionic bonds and "weak bonds" or "secondary bond" such as dipole–dipole interactions, the London dispersion force and hydrogen bonding. Since opposite charges attract via a simple electromagnetic force, the negatively charged electrons that are orbiting the nucleus and the positively charged protons in the nucleus attract each other. 

Climate<====>5999<====>Climate    Climate is the statistics of weather over long periods of time.   It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time.  Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region. A region's climate is generated by the climate system, which has five components: atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere.  AR4 SYR Synthesis Report Annexes.  Ipcc. 

History of the Comoros<====>6000<====>History of the Comoros The history of the Comoros goes back some 1,500 years.  It has been inhabited by various groups throughout this time.  France colonised the islands in the 19th century.  The Comoros finally became independent in 1975. Early inhabitantsAccording to myth, the Comoros islands were first visited by Phoenician sailors.    The earliest inhabitants of the islands were probably Bantu-speaking Africans;  the earliest evidence of settlement of the islands dates from the sixth century.  "Early voyages and settlements", Country Studies  Traces of this original culture have blended with successive waves of African, Arab and Malagasy. 

Geography of the Comoros<====>6001<====>Geography of the Comoros The Comoros archipelago consists of four main islands aligned along a northwest-southeast axis at the north end of the Mozambique Channel, between Mozambique and the island of Madagascar.  Still widely known by their French names, the islands officially have been called by their Swahili names by the Comorian government.  They are Grande Comore (Njazidja), Mohéli (Mwali), Anjouan (Nzwani), and Mayotte (Mahoré).  The islands' distance from each other—Grande Comore is some 200 kilometers from Mayotte, forty kilometers from Mohéli, and eighty kilometers from Grande Comore—along with a lack of good harbor facilities, make transportation and communication difficult. 

Demographics of the Comoros<====>6002<====>Demographics of the ComorosThe Comorians inhabiting Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Mohéli (86% of the population) share African-Arab origins.  Islam is the dominant religion, and Quranic schools for children reinforce its influence.  Although Islamic culture is firmly established throughout, a small minority are Christian. The most common language is Comorian, related to Swahili.  French and Arabic also are spoken.  About 89% of the population is literate. The Comoros have had seven censuses since World War II:  195119561958-09-07 : 183,1331966-07-06 : Note: in 1974 Mayotte was removed from the Comoros1980-09-15 : 335,1501991-09-15 : 446,8172003-09-15 : 575,660Population density figures conceal a great disparity between the republic's most crowded island, Nzwani, which had a density of 470 persons per square kilometer in 1991; Ngazidja, which had a density of 250 persons per square kilometer in 1991; and Mwali, where the 1991 population density figure was 120 persons per square kilometer. 

Politics of the Comoros<====>6003<====>Politics of the Comoros  Politics of the Union of the Comoros takes place in a framework of a federal presidential republic, whereby the President of the Comoros is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system.  Executive power is exercised by the government.  Federal legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament. As of 2008, Comoros and Mauritania were considered by US-based organization Freedom House as the only real “electoral democracies” of the Arab World.  Political backgroundThe Union of the Comoros, known as the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros until 2003, is ruled by Ahmed Abdallah Sambi. 

Telecommunications in the Comoros<====>6005<====>Telecommunications in the ComorosIn large part thanks to international aid programs, Moroni has international telecommunications service.

Transport in the Comoros<====>6006<====>Transport in the Comoros There are a number of systems of transport in the Comoros.   The Comoros possesses   of road, of which   are paved.   It has three seaports: Fomboni, Moroni and Moutsamoudou, but does not have a merchant marine, and no longer has any railway network.   It has four airports, all with paved runways, one with runways over   long, with the others having runways shorter than  . The isolation of the Comoros had made air traffic a major means of transportation.  One of President Abdallah's accomplishments was to make the Comoros more accessible by air. 

Foreign relations of the Comoros<====>6007<====>Foreign relations of the Comoros In November 1975, Comoros became the 143rd member of the United Nations.  The new nation was defined as consisting of the entire archipelago, despite the fact that France maintains control over Mayotte. OverviewComoros also is a member of the African Union, the Arab League, the European Development Fund, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Indian Ocean Commission, and the African Development Bank. The government fostered close relationships with the more conservative (and oil-rich) Arab states, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.   It frequently received aid from those countries and the regional financial institutions they influenced, such as the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development. 

Military of the Comoros<====>6008<====>Military of the Comoros The Comorian Armed Forces (French Armée nationale de développement) consist of a small standing army and a 500-member police force, as well as a 500-member defense force.  A defense treaty with France provides naval resources for protection of territorial waters, training of Comorian military personnel, and air surveillance.  France maintains a small troop presence in the Comoros at government request.  France maintains a small maritime base and a Foreign Legion Detachment (DLEM) on Mayotte.

Computer worm<====>6010<====>Computer worm  A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers.   Often, it uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on the target computer to access it.  Worms almost always cause at least some harm to the network, even if only by consuming bandwidth, whereas viruses almost always corrupt or modify files on a targeted computer. Many worms that have been created are designed only to spread, and do not attempt to change the systems they pass through.  However, as the Morris worm and Mydoom showed, even these "payload-free" worms can cause major disruption by increasing network traffic and other unintended effects. 

Chomsky hierarchy<====>6011<====>Chomsky hierarchyIn the formal languages of computer science and linguistics, the Chomsky hierarchy (occasionally referred to as Chomsky–Schützenberger hierarchy) is a containment hierarchy of classes of formal grammars.This hierarchy of grammars was described by Noam Chomsky in 1956.  It is also named after Marcel-Paul Schützenberger, who played a crucial role in the development of the theory of formal languages.Formal grammars A formal grammar of this type consists of a finite set of production rules (left-hand side → right-hand side), where each side consists of a finite sequence of the following symbols:a finite set of nonterminal symbols (indicating that some production rule can yet be applied)a finite set of terminal symbols (indicating that no production rule can be applied)a start symbol (a distinguished nonterminal symbol)A formal grammar provides an axiom schema for (or generates) a formal language, which is a (usually infinite) set of finite-length sequences of symbols  that may be constructed by applying production rules to another sequence of symbols (which initially contains just the start symbol).  A rule may be applied by replacing an occurrence of the symbols on its left-hand side with those that appear on its right-hand side.  A sequence of rule applications is called a derivation.  Such a grammar defines the formal language: all words consisting solely of terminal symbols which can be reached by a derivation from the start symbol.Nonterminals are often represented by uppercase letters, terminals by lowercase letters, and the start symbol by  .  For example, the grammar with terminals  , nonterminals  , production rules  →    → ε  (where ε is the empty string)  →    →  and start symbol  , defines the language of all words of the form   a^n b^n   (i.e.   copies of   followed by   copies of  ).The following is a simpler grammar that defines the same language: Terminals  , Nonterminals  , Start symbol  , Production rules  →    → εAs another example, a grammar for a toy subset of English language is given by:terminals nonterminals production rules  → → →    → →    →    →    →    →    →    →  and start symbol  . An example derivation is  →   →   →   →   →   →   →   →   →   →   →   →   →  .Other sequences that can be derived from this grammar are: "ideas hate great linguists", and "ideas generate". While these sentences are nonsensical, they are syntactically correct. A syntactically incorrect sentence ( e.g. "ideas ideas great hate") cannot be derived from this grammar. See "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" for a similar example given by Chomsky in 1957; see Phrase structure grammar and Phrase structure rules for more natural language examples and the problems of formal grammar in that area.The hierarchyThe following table summarizes each of Chomsky's four types of grammars, the class of language it generates, the type of automaton that recognizes it, and the form its rules must have.Grammar Languages Automaton Production rules (constraints)* Type-0 Recursively enumerable Turing machine  \alpha \rightarrow \beta  (no restrictions) Type-1 Context-sensitive Linear-bounded non-deterministic Turing machine  \alpha A \beta \rightarrow \alpha \gamma \beta  Type-2 Context-free Non-deterministic pushdown automaton  A \rightarrow \gamma  Type-3 Regular Finite state automaton  A \rightarrow a   and  A \rightarrow aB  Meaning of symbols:  a  = terminal  \alpha  = terminal, non-terminal, or empty  \beta  = terminal, non-terminal, or empty  \gamma  = terminal or non-terminal  A  = non-terminal  B  = non-terminal  Note that the set of grammars corresponding to recursive languages is not a member of this hierarchy; these would be properly between Type-0 and Type-1.Every regular language is context-free, every context-free language is context-sensitive, every context-sensitive language is recursive and every recursive language is recursively enumerable. These are all proper inclusions, meaning that there exist recursively enumerable languages that are not context-sensitive, context-sensitive languages that are not context-free and context-free languages that are not regular.Type-0 grammars Type-0 grammars include all formal grammars. They generate exactly all languages that can be recognized by a Turing machine. These languages are also known as the recursively enumerable or Turing-recognizable languages.Note that this is different from the recursive languages, which can be decided by an always-halting Turing machine.Type-1 grammars Type-1 grammars generate the context-sensitive languages.  These grammars have rules of the form  \alpha A\beta \rightarrow \alpha\gamma\beta  with  A  a nonterminal and  \alpha ,  \beta  and  \gamma  strings of terminals and/or nonterminals. The strings  \alpha  and  \beta  may be empty, but  \gamma  must be nonempty.  The rule  S \rightarrow \epsilon  is allowed if  S  does not appear on the right side of any rule.  The languages described by these grammars are exactly all languages that can be recognized by a linear bounded automaton (a nondeterministic Turing machine whose tape is bounded by a constant times the length of the input.)Type-2 grammars Type-2 grammars generate the context-free languages. These are defined by rules of the form  A \rightarrow \gamma  with  A  being a nonterminal and  \gamma  being a string of terminals and/or nonterminals. These languages are exactly all languages that can be recognized by a non-deterministic pushdown automaton. Context-free languages—or rather its subset of deterministic context-free language—are the theoretical basis for the phrase structure of most programming languages, though their syntax also includes context-sensitive name resolution due to declarations and scope. Often a subset of grammars is used to make parsing easier, such as by an LL parser.Type-3 grammars Type-3 grammars generate the regular languages.  Such a grammar restricts its rules to a single nonterminal on the left-hand side and a right-hand side consisting of a single terminal, possibly followed by a single nonterminal (right regular). Alternatively, the right-hand side of the grammar can consist of a single terminal, possibly preceded by a single nonterminal (left regular). These generate the same languages. However, if left-regular rules and right-regular rules are combined, the language need no longer be regular. The rule  S \rightarrow \epsilon  is also allowed here if  S  does not appear on the right side of any rule.  These languages are exactly all languages that can be decided by a finite state automaton. Additionally, this family of formal languages can be obtained by regular expressions. Regular languages are commonly used to define search patterns and the lexical structure of programming languages.References 

Cathode ray tube<====>6014<====>Cathode ray tube The cathode ray tube (CRT) is a vacuum tube that contains one or more electron guns and a phosphorescent screen, and is used to display images.It modulates, accelerates, and deflects electron beam(s) onto the screen to create the images.  The images may represent electrical waveforms (oscilloscope), pictures (television, computer monitor), radar targets, or others.  CRTs have also been used as memory devices, in which case the visible light emitted from the fluorescent material (if any) is not intended to have significant meaning to a visual observer (though the visible pattern on the tube face may cryptically represent the stored data). 

Crystal<====>6015<====>CrystalA crystal or crystalline solid is a solid material whose constituents (such as atoms, molecules, or ions) are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure, forming a crystal lattice that extends in all directions.    In addition, macroscopic single crystals are usually identifiable by their geometrical shape, consisting of flat faces with specific, characteristic orientations.  The scientific study of crystals and crystal formation is known as crystallography.  The process of crystal formation via mechanisms of crystal growth is called crystallization or solidification. The word crystal derives from the Ancient Greek word   ( ), meaning both "ice" and "rock crystal",  from   ( ), "icy cold, frost". 

Cytosine<====>6016<====>Cytosine  Cytosine ( ;   C) is one of the four main bases found in DNA and RNA, along with adenine, guanine, and thymine (uracil in RNA).  It is a pyrimidine derivative, with a heterocyclic aromatic ring and two substituents attached (an amine group at position 4 and a keto group at position 2).  The nucleoside of cytosine is cytidine.   In Watson-Crick base pairing, it forms three(3) hydrogen bonds with guanine. HistoryCytosine was discovered and named by Albrecht Kossel and Albert Neumann in 1894 when it was hydrolyzed from calf thymus tissues.    A structure was proposed in 1903, and was synthesized (and thus confirmed) in the laboratory in the same year. 

Computational chemistry<====>6019<====>Computational chemistryComputational chemistry is a branch of chemistry that uses computer simulation to assist in solving chemical problems.  It uses methods of theoretical chemistry, incorporated into efficient computer programs, to calculate the structures and properties of molecules and solids.  It is necessary because, apart from relatively recent results concerning the hydrogen molecular ion (dihydrogen cation, see references therein for more details), the quantum many-body problem cannot be solved analytically, much less in closed form.   While computational results normally complement the information obtained by chemical experiments, it can in some cases predict hitherto unobserved chemical phenomena.  It is widely used in the design of new drugs and materials. 

Crash (J. G. Ballard novel)<====>6020<====>Crash (J.  G.  Ballard novel)  Crash  is a novel by English author J.  G.  Ballard, first published in 1973.  It is a story about symphorophilia specifically car-crash sexual fetishism: its protagonists become sexually aroused by staging and participating in real car-crashes. It was a highly controversial novel: one publisher's reader returned the verdict "This author is beyond psychiatric help.  Do Not Publish!"  In 1996, the novel was made into a film of the same name by David Cronenberg. Plot summaryThe story is told through the eyes of narrator James Ballard, named after the author himself, but it centers on the sinister figure of Dr. 

C (programming language)<====>6021<====>C (programming language)   C ( , as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations.  By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems. C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell Labs,  and used to re-implement the Unix operating system. 

Cytology<====>6022<====>CytologyCytology (from Greek  , kytos, "a hollow";  and  ,  ) is the study of cells.   Cytology is that branch of life science that deals with the study of cells in terms of structure, function and chemistry.  Robert Hooke (1635 – 1703) is sometimes seen as the father of cytology.  Based on usage it can refer to: CytogeneticsCytopathology: the study of cellular disease and the use of cellular changes for the diagnosis of disease. Cell biology, or cytobiology: the study of (normal) cellular anatomy, function and chemistry.   The International Academy of Cytology has as its official journal Acta Cytologica. 

Castle of the Winds<====>6023<====>Castle of the Winds Castle of the Winds (also known as "Castle of the Winds: Vanquish the Dark Forces")  is a tile-based roguelike video game for Microsoft Windows.  It was developed by SaadaSoft in 1989  and distributed by Epic MegaGames in 1993.   The game was given around 1998 into the public domain and provided as Freeware download by the author Rick Saada.  Release historyThe game is composed of two parts: A Question of Vengeance, released as shareware, and Lifthransir's Bane, sold commercially.  A combined license for both parts was also sold. 

Calvinism<====>6024<====>Calvinism    Calvinism (also called the Reformed tradition, Reformed Christianity, Reformed Protestantism, or the Reformed faith) is a major branch of Protestantism that follows the theological tradition and forms of Christian practice of John Calvin and other Reformation-era theologians. Calvinists broke from the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century.  Calvinism differs from Lutherans on the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, theories of worship, and the use of God's law for believers, among other things. As declared in the Westminster and Second Helvetic confessions, the core doctrines are predestination and election. 

Countable set<====>6026<====>Countable set  In mathematics, a countable set is a set with the same cardinality (number of elements) as some subset of the set of natural numbers.  A countable set is either a finite set or a countably infinite set.  Whether finite or infinite, the elements of a countable set can always be counted one at a time and, although the counting may never finish, every element of the set is associated with a unique natural number. Some authors use countable set to mean countably infinite alone.To avoid this ambiguity, the term at most countable may be used when finite sets are included and countably infinite, enumerable,  or denumerable    otherwise. 

Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules<====>6034<====>Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules  The Cahn–Ingold–Prelog (CIP) sequence rules, named for organic chemists R. S.  Cahn, C. K.  Ingold, and V.  Prelog—alternatively termed the CIP priority rules, system, or conventions—are a standard process used in organic chemistry to completely and unequivocally name a stereoisomer of a molecule.  The purpose of the CIP system is to assign an R or S descriptor to each stereocenter and an E or Z descriptor to each double bond so that the configuration of the entire molecule can be specified uniquely by including the descriptors in its systematic name. 

Celibacy<====>6035<====>Celibacy Celibacy (from Latin, cælibatus") is the state of voluntarily being unmarried, sexually abstinent,  or both, usually for religious reasons.    It is often in association with the role of a religious official or devotee.   In its narrow sense, the term celibacy is applied only to those for whom the unmarried state is the result of a sacred vow, act of renunciation, or religious conviction. In a wider sense, it is commonly understood to only mean abstinence from sexual activity. 

Coalition government<====>6036<====>Coalition government  A coalition government is a cabinet of a parliamentary government in which many or multiple  political parties cooperate, reducing the dominance of any one party within that coalition.  The usual reason for this arrangement is that no party on its own can achieve a majority in the parliament.  A coalition government might also be created in a time of national difficulty or crisis (for example, during wartime or economic crisis) to give a government the high degree of perceived political legitimacy or collective identity it desires while also playing a role in diminishing internal political strife. 

Chemical engineering<====>6038<====>Chemical engineeringChemical engineering is a branch of engineering that applies physical sciences (physics and chemistry), life sciences (microbiology and biochemistry), together with applied mathematics and economics to produce, transform, transport, and properly use chemicals, materials and energy.  A chemical engineer designs large-scale processes that convert chemicals, raw materials, living cells, microorganisms and energy into useful forms and products. Chemical engineers are involved in many aspects of plant design and operation, including safety and hazard assessments, process design and analysis, control engineering, chemical reaction engineering, construction specification and operating instructions. EtymologyA 1996 British Journal for the History of Science article cites James F.

Compact space<====>6042<====>Compact space In mathematics, and more specifically in general topology, compactness is a property that generalizes the notion of a subset of Euclidean space being closed (that is, containing all its limit points) and bounded (that is, having all its points lie within some fixed distance of each other).  Examples include a closed interval, a rectangle, or a finite set of points.  This notion is defined for more general topological spaces than Euclidean space in various ways. One such generalization is that a topological space is sequentially compact if any infinite sequence of points sampled from the space must have an infinite subsequence that converges to some point of the space. 

Clodius<====>6045<====>Clodius Clodius is an alternate form of the Roman nomen Claudius, a patrician gens that was traditionally regarded as Sabine in origin.  The alternation of o and au is characteristic of the Sabine dialect.  The feminine form is Clodia. Republican eraPublius Clodius Pulcher  the Late Republic, the spelling Clodius is most prominently associated with Publius Clodius Pulcher, a popularist politician who gave up his patrician status through a order in order to qualify for the office of tribune of the plebs.  Clodius positioned himself as a champion of the urban plebs, supporting free grain for the poor and the right of association in guilds (collegia); because of this individual's ideology, Clodius has often been taken as a more "plebeian" spelling and a gesture of political solidarity. 

Cicero<====>6046<====>Cicero    Marcus Tullius Cicero  ( ;  ; 3 January 106 BC – 7 December 43 BC) was a Roman politician and lawyer, who served as consul in the year 63 BC.  He came from a wealthy municipal family of the Roman equestrian order, and is considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists.   His influence on the Latin language was so immense that the subsequent history of prose, not only in Latin but in European languages up to the 19th century, was said to be either a reaction against or a return to his style. According to Michael Grant, "the influence of Cicero upon the history of European literature and ideas greatly exceeds that of any other prose writer in any language". 

Consul<====>6047<====>Consul  Consul (abbrev.  cos. ; Latin plural consules) was the title of one of the chief magistrates of the Roman Republic, and subsequently a somewhat significant title under the Roman Empire.  The title was also used in other city states and also revived in modern states, notably in the First French Republic.  The relating adjective is consular, from the  consularis. Modern use of the term In modern terminology, a consul is a type of diplomat.   The American Heritage Dictionary defines consul as "an official appointed by a government to reside in a foreign country and represent its interests there. 

List of equations in classical mechanics<====>6050<====>List of equations in classical mechanicsClassical mechanics is the branch of physics used to describe the motion of macroscopic objects.   It is the most familiar of the theories of physics.  The concepts it covers, such as mass, acceleration, and force, are commonly used and known.   The subject is based upon a three-dimensional Euclidean space with fixed axes, called a frame of reference.  The point of concurrency of the three axes is known as the origin of the particular space.  Classical mechanics utilises many equations—as well as other mathematical concepts—which relate various physical quantities to one another. 

Cursus honorum<====>6051<====>Cursus honorum  The cursus honorum (Latin: "course of offices") was the sequential order of public offices held by aspiring politicians in both the Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire.  It was designed for men of senatorial rank.  The cursus honorum comprised a mixture of military and political administration posts.  Each office had a minimum age for election.  There were minimum intervals between holding successive offices and laws forbade repeating an office.  These rules were altered and flagrantly ignored in the course of the last century of the Republic.  For example, Gaius Marius held consulships for five years in a row between 104 BC and 100 BC. 

Continental drift<====>6056<====>Continental drift  Continental drift is the movement of the Earth's continents relative to each other, thus appearing to "drift" across the ocean bed. The speculation that continents might have 'drifted' was first put forward by Abraham Ortelius in 1596.  The concept was independently and more fully developed by Alfred Wegener in 1912, but his theory was rejected by some for lack of a mechanism (though this was supplied later by Arthur Holmes).  The idea of continental drift has been subsumed by the theory of plate tectonics, which explains how the continents move. 

Commodores<====>6057<====>Commodores   Commodores are an American funk/soul band, which was at its peak in the late 1970s through the mid 1980s.  The members of the group met as mostly freshmen at Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) in 1968, and signed with Motown in November 1972, having first caught the public eye opening for The Jackson 5 while on tour. The group's most successful period was in the late 1970s and early 1980s when Lionel Richie was the co-lead singer.  The band's biggest hit singles are ballads such as "Easy", "Three Times a Lady", and "Nightshift"; and funky dance hits which include "Brick House", "Fancy Dancer", "Lady (You Bring Me Up)", and "Too Hot ta Trot". 

Collagen<====>6058<====>Collagen Collagen   is the main structural protein in the extracellular space in the various connective tissues in animal bodies.  As the main component of connective tissue, it is the most abundant protein in mammals,  making up from 25% to 35% of the whole-body protein content.  Collagen consists of amino acids wound together to form triple-helices to form of elongated fibrils.   It is mostly found in fibrous tissues such as tendons, ligaments and skin. Depending upon the degree of mineralization, collagen tissues may be rigid (bone), compliant (tendon), or have a gradient from rigid to compliant (cartilage). 

Calvin and Hobbes<====>6059<====>Calvin and Hobbes   Calvin and Hobbes is   a daily comic strip by American cartoonist Bill Watterson that was syndicated from November 18, 1985 to December 31, 1995.  Commonly cited as "the last great newspaper comic",Calvin and Hobbes has evinced broad and enduring popularity, influence and academic interest. Calvin and Hobbes follows the humorous antics of Calvin, a precocious, mischievous and adventurous six-year-old boy, and Hobbes, his sardonic stuffed tiger.  Set in the contemporary suburban United States, the strip depicts Calvin's frequent flights of fancy and his friendship with Hobbes. 

Campaign for Real Ale<====>6060<====>Campaign for Real AleThe Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) is an independent voluntary consumer organisation headquartered in St Albans, England, which promotes real ale, real cider and the traditional British pub.  With over 190,000 members, it is now the largest single-issue consumer group in the UK,    and is a founding member of the European Beer Consumers Union (EBCU). HistoryThe organisation was founded in 1971 in Kruger's bar in Dunquin, Kerry, Ireland   by Michael Hardman, Graham Lees, Jim Makin, and Bill Mellor, who were opposed to the growing mass production of beer and the homogenisation of the British brewing industry. 

CNO cycle<====>6061<====>CNO cycle The CNO cycle (for carbon–nitrogen–oxygen) is one of the two known sets of fusion reactions by which stars convert hydrogen to helium, the other being the proton–proton chain reaction.  Unlike the latter, the CNO cycle is a catalytic cycle.  It is dominant in stars that are more than 1. 3 times as massive as the Sun.  In the CNO cycle, four protons fuse, using carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopes as catalysts, to produce one alpha particle, two positrons and two electron neutrinos.   Although there are various paths and catalysts involved in the CNO cycles,  all these cycles have the same net result:4    +  2    →     +  2    +  2    +  2    +  3    +  24. 

Craps<====>6062<====>Craps Craps is a dice game in which the players make wagers on the outcome of the roll, or a series of rolls, of a pair of dice.  Players may wager money against each other (playing "street craps", also known as "shooting dice" or "rolling dice") or a bank (playing "casino craps", also known as "table craps", or often just "craps").   Because it requires little equipment, "street craps" can be played in informal settings. HistoryCraps developed from a simplification of the early English game of "hazard".  Its origins are complex and may date to the Crusades, later being influenced by French gamblers. 

Carl von Clausewitz<====>6066<====>Carl von Clausewitz  Carl Philipp Gottfried (or Gottlieb) von Clausewitz    ( ; 1 June 1780 – 16 November 1831) Bassford, Christopher (2002).  "Clausewitz and his Works" at clausewitz. com.  Retrieved 2007-06-30.   was a Prussian general and military theorist who stressed the "moral" (meaning, in modern terms, psychological) and political aspects of war.  His most notable work, Vom Kriege (On War), was unfinished at his death. Clausewitz was a realist in many different senses and, while in some respects a romantic, also drew heavily on the rationalist ideas of the European Enlightenment. Clausewitz's thinking is often described as Hegelian because of his dialectical method; but, although he was probably personally acquainted with Hegel, there remains debate as to whether or not Clausewitz was in fact influenced by him. 

Common Lisp<====>6068<====>Common Lisp Common Lisp (CL) is a dialect of the Lisp programming language, published in ANSI standard document ANSI INCITS 226-1994 (R2004) (formerly X3. 226-1994 (R1999)).   The Common Lisp HyperSpec, a hyperlinked HTML version, has been derived from the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  The Common Lisp language was developed as a standardized and improved successor of Maclisp.  By the early 1980s several groups were already at work on diverse successors to MacLisp: Lisp Machine Lisp (aka ZetaLisp), Spice Lisp, NIL and S-1 Lisp.  Common Lisp sought to unify, standardise, and extend the features of these MacLisp dialects. 

Color code<====>6069<====>Color code  A color code or colour code is a system for displaying information by using different colors. The earliest examples of color codes in use are for long distance communication by use of flags, as in semaphore communication.   The United Kingdom adopted a color code scheme for such communication wherein red signified danger and white signified safety, with other colors having similar assignments of meaning. As chemistry and other technologies advanced, it became expedient to use coloration as a signal for telling apart things that would otherwise be confusingly similar, such as wiring in electrical and electronic devices, and pharmaceutical pills. 

Cauchy sequence<====>6085<====>Cauchy sequence In mathematics, a Cauchy sequence ( ;    ), named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy, is a sequence whose elements become arbitrarily close to each other as the sequence progresses.    More precisely, given any small positive distance, all but a finite number of elements of the sequence are less than that given distance from each other. It is not sufficient for each term to become arbitrarily close to the preceding term.  For instance, in the harmonic series  \sum \frac{1}{n}  the difference between consecutive terms in the sequence of partial sums decreases as  \tfrac 1n , however the series does not converge. 

Common Era<====>6088<====>Common Era  Common Era or Current Era (CE)  is a name for a calendar era widely used around the world today.  The era preceding CE is known as before the Common or Current Era (BCE).  The Current Era notation system can be used as an alternative to the Dionysian era system, which distinguishes eras as AD ( , "[the] year of [the] Lord")    and BC ("before Christ").  The two notation systems are numerically equivalent; thus "  CE" corresponds to "AD  " and "400 BCE" corresponds to "400 BC". Both notations refer to the Gregorian calendar (and its predecessor, the Julian calendar). 

Charles Robert Malden<====>6091<====>Charles Robert Malden    Charles Robert Malden (9 August 1797 – 23 May 1855), was a nineteenth-century British naval officer, surveyor and educator.  He is the discoverer of Malden Island in the central Pacific, which is named in his honour.  He also founded Windlesham House School at Brighton, England. BiographyMalden was born in Putney, Surrey, son of Jonas Malden, a surgeon.  He entered British naval service at the age of 11 on 22 June 1809.  He served nine years as a volunteer 1st class, midshipman, and shipmate, including one year in the English Channel and Bay of Biscay (1809), four years at the Cape of Good Hope and in the East Indies (1809–14), two and a half years on the North American and West Indian stations (1814–16), and a year and a half in the Mediterranean (1817–18). 

Chechnya<====>6095<====>Chechnya  The Chechen Republic ( ;  ;  , Noxçiyn Respublika), commonly referred to as Chechnya ( ;  ;  , Noxçiyçö),  is a federal subject (a republic) of Russia. It is located in the North Caucasus, situated in the southernmost part of Eastern Europe, and within   of the Caspian Sea.   The capital of the republic is the city of Grozny.   , the republic was reported to have a population of 1,268,989 people;    however, that number has been questioned by multiple demographers, who think such population growth after two deadly wars is highly implausible. 

Canonization<====>6097<====>Canonization   Canonization is the act by which a Christian church declares that a person who has died was a saint, upon which declaration the person is included in the "canon", or list, of recognized saints.  Originally, a person was recognized as a saint without any formal process.  Later, different processes were developed, such as those used today in the Anglican Communion, the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Oriental Orthodox Church. Historical developmentThe first persons honored as saints were the martyrs.  Pious legends of their deaths were considered affirmations of the truth of their faith in Christ. 

Carboxylic acid<====>6099<====>Carboxylic acid  A carboxylic acid   is an organic compound that contains a carboxyl group (C(=O)OH).   The general formula of a carboxylic acid is R–COOH, with R referring to the rest of the (possibly quite large) molecule.   Carboxylic acids occur widely and include the amino acids (which make up proteins) and acetic acid (which is part of vinegar and occurs in metabolism). Salts and esters of carboxylic acids are called carboxylates.  When a carboxyl group is deprotonated, its conjugate base forms a carboxylate anion.  Carboxylate ions are resonance-stabilized, and this increased stability makes carboxylic acids more acidic than alcohols. 

Chernobyl<====>6100<====>ChernobylChernobyl or Chornobyl ( ;    ;   ; ) is a city in the restricted Chernobyl Exclusion Zone situated in the Ivankiv Raion of northern Kiev Oblast, near Ukraine's border with Belarus.  Chernobyl is about   northeast of Kiev, and approximately   southwest of the Belarusian city of Gomel.  The city was the administrative center of Chernobyl Raion (district)  from 1923 until it was disestablished in 1988.  Before its evacuation, the city had about 14,000 residents.    , the city has a population of 690. 

Cyan<====>6102<====>Cyan  Cyan (   or   ) is a greenish-blue color.    It is evoked by light with a predominant wavelength of between 490 520 nm, between the wavelengths of blue and green.  In the subtractive color system, or CMYK (subtractive), which can be overlaid to produce all colors in paint and color printing, cyan is one of the primary colors, along with magenta, yellow, and black.  In the additive color system, or RGB (additive) color model, used to create all the colors on a computer or television display, cyan is made by mixing equal amounts of green and blue light. 

Conventional insulin therapy<====>6105<====>Conventional insulin therapy Conventional insulin therapy is a therapeutic regimen for treatment of diabetes mellitus which contrasts with the newer intensive insulin therapy. This older method (prior to the development home blood glucose monitoring) is still in use in a proportion of cases. Conventional insulin therapy is characterized by:Insulin injections of a mixture of regular (or rapid) and intermediate acting insulin are performed two times a day, or to improve overnight glucose, mixed in the morning to cover breakfast and lunch, but with regular (or rapid) acting insulin alone for dinner and intermediate acting insulin at bedtime (instead of being mixed in at dinner). 

Cream<====>6109<====>Cream Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-butterfat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization.  In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, will eventually rise to the top.  In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called "separators".  In many countries, cream is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content.  Cream can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets.   Cream has high levels of saturated fat.   Cream skimmed from milk may be called "sweet cream" to distinguish it from whey cream skimmed from whey, a by-product of cheese-making. 

Chemical vapor deposition<====>6111<====>Chemical vapor deposition Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a chemical process used to produce high quality, high-performance, solid materials.  The process is often used in the semiconductor industry to produce thin films.  In typical CVD, the wafer (substrate) is exposed to one or more volatile  , which react and/or decompose on the substrate surface to produce the desired deposit.  Frequently, volatile by-products are also produced, which are removed by gas flow through the reaction chamber. Microfabrication processes widely use CVD to deposit materials in various forms, including: monocrystalline, polycrystalline, amorphous, and epitaxial.  These materials include: silicon (SiO 2 , germanium, carbide, nitride, oxynitride), carbon (fiber, nanofibers, nanotubes, diamond and graphene), fluorocarbons, filaments, tungsten, titanium nitride and various high-k dielectrics. 

CN Tower<====>6112<====>CN TowerThe CN Tower ( ) is a   concrete communications and observation tower in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Built on the former Railway Lands, it was completed in 1976, and held the record for the world's tallest free-standing structure for 32 years from 1975–2007 and was the world's tallest tower until 2009 being overtaken by Burj Khalifa and Canton Tower, respectively.   It is now the third tallest tower in the world and remains the tallest free-standing structure in the Western Hemisphere, a signature icon of Toronto's skyline,   attracting more than two million international visitors annually. 

Chain rule<====>6113<====>Chain rule  In calculus, the chain rule is a formula for computing the derivative of the composition of two or more functions.  That is, if f and g are functions, then the chain rule expresses the derivative of their composition   (the function which maps x to f(g(x)) ) in terms of the derivatives of f and g and the product of functions as follows: (f\circ g)'=(f'\circ g)\cdot g'.  This can be written more explicitly in terms of the variable.  Let  , or equivalently,   for all x.  Then one can also write F'(x) = f'(g(x)) g'(x). 

P versus NP problem<====>6115<====>P versus NP problem   The P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in computer science.  It asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified (technically, verified in polynomial time) can also be solved quickly (again, in polynomial time). The underlying issues were first discussed in the 1950s, in letters from John Forbes Nash Jr.  to the National Security Agency, and from Kurt Gödel to John von Neumann.  The precise statement of the P versus NP problem was introduced in 1971 by Stephen Cook in his seminal paper "The complexity of theorem proving procedures"  and is considered by many to be the most important open problem in the field. 

Charles Sanders Peirce<====>6117<====>Charles Sanders Peirce   Charles Sanders Peirce ( ,  like "purse"; September 10, 1839 – April 19, 1914) was an American philosopher, logician, mathematician, and scientist who is sometimes known as "the father of pragmatism".  He was educated as a chemist and employed as a scientist for 30 years.  Today he is appreciated largely for his contributions to logic, mathematics, philosophy, scientific methodology, and semiotics, and for his founding of pragmatism. An innovator in mathematics, statistics, philosophy, research methodology, and various sciences, Peirce considered himself,  first and foremost, a logician.  He made major contributions to logic, but logic for him encompassed much of that which is now called epistemology and philosophy of science. 

Carnot heat engine<====>6118<====>Carnot heat engineA Carnot heat engine  is an engine that operates on the reversible Carnot cycle.  The basic model for this engine was developed by Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot in 1824.   The Carnot engine model was graphically expanded upon by Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron in 1834 and mathematically explored by Rudolf Clausius in 1857 from which the concept of entropy emerged. Every thermodynamic system exists in a particular state.  A thermodynamic cycle occurs when a system is taken through a series of different states, and finally returned to its initial state.  In the process of going through this cycle, the system may perform work on its surroundings, thereby acting as a heat engine. 

Central America<====>6121<====>Central America    Central America ( , Centroamérica) is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with the South American continent on the southeast.  Central America is bordered by Mexico to the north, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west.  Central America consists of seven countries: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama.   The combined population of Central America is between 41,739,000 (2009 estimate)  and 42,688,190 (2012 estimate).  Central America is a part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, which extends from northern Guatemala through to central Panama. 

Continuous function<====>6122<====>Continuous function In mathematics, a continuous function is a function for which sufficiently small changes in the input result in arbitrarily small changes in the output.  Otherwise, a function is said to be a discontinuous function.  A continuous function with a continuous inverse function is called a homeomorphism. Continuity of functions is one of the core concepts of topology, which is treated in full generality below.  The introductory portion of this article focuses on the special case where the inputs and outputs of functions are real numbers.   A stronger form of continuity is uniform continuity. 

Curl (mathematics)<====>6123<====>Curl (mathematics)  In vector calculus, the curl is a vector operator that describes the infinitesimal rotation of a vector field in three-dimensional Euclidean space.  At every point in the field, the curl of that point is represented by a vector.  The attributes of this vector (length and direction) characterize the rotation at that point. The direction of the curl is the axis of rotation, as determined by the right-hand rule, and the magnitude of the curl is the magnitude of rotation.  If the vector field represents the flow velocity of a moving fluid, then the curl is the circulation density of the fluid. 

Carl Friedrich Gauss<====>6125<====>Carl Friedrich Gauss    Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss ( ;  ,  ;  ; 30 April 1777 23 February 1855) was a German mathematician who made significant contributions to many fields, including number theory, algebra, statistics, analysis, differential geometry, geodesy, geophysics, mechanics, electrostatics, magnetic fields, astronomy, matrix theory, and optics. Sometimes referred to as the Princeps mathematicorum  ( ) and "the greatest mathematician since antiquity", Gauss had an exceptional influence in many fields of mathematics and science, and is ranked among history's most influential mathematicians.  Dunnington, G.  Waldo.  (May 1927).Scientific Monthly XXIV: 402–414. 

Cornish language<====>6130<====>Cornish language   Cornish ( ) is a Southwestern Brittonic Celtic language native to Cornwall.  The language began a revival in the early 20th century and is considered to be an important part of Cornish identity, culture and heritage.    Cornish is currently a recognised minority language of the United Kingdom,  protected under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, and has a growing number of second language speakers    and a small number of first language speakers.    Along with Welsh and Breton, Cornish is descended directly from the Common Brittonic language spoken throughout much of Britain before the English language came to dominate. 

Complexity theory<====>6132<====>Complexity theoryComplexity theory (or complexity science) is the study of Complexity of Complex systems. It may also refer to:Complexity theory and organizations, the application of complexity theory to strategyComplexity economics, the application of complexity theory to economicsComplex adaptive system, a special case of complex systemsComputational complexity theory, a field in theoretical computer science and mathematicsSee alsoComplexityComputational complexityComplexity (disambiguation)Systems theoryComplex adaptive systemComplex networks 

Charybdis<====>6134<====>Charybdis Charybdis ( ; Ancient Greek: Χάρυβδις,  , Kharybdis) was a sea monster, later rationalized as a whirlpool and considered a shipping hazard in the Strait of Messina. DescriptionThe sea monster Charybdis was believed to live under a small rock on one side of a narrow channel.  Opposite her was Scylla, another sea monster, that lived inside a much larger rock.  [Odyssey, Book XII] The sides of the strait were within an arrow-shot of each other, and sailors attempting to avoid one of them would come in reach of the other.  To be "between Scylla and Charybdis" therefore means to be presented with two opposite dangers, the task being to find a route that avoids both. 

Carbon monoxide<====>6136<====>Carbon monoxide  Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that is slightly less dense than air.  It is toxic to hemoglobic animals (both invertebrate and vertebrate, including humans) when encountered in concentrations above about 35 ppm, although it is also produced in normal animal metabolism in low quantities, and is thought to have some normal biological functions.  In the atmosphere, it is spatially variable and short lived, having a role in the formation of ground-level ozone. Carbon monoxide consists of one carbon atom and one oxygen atom, connected by a triple bond that consists of two covalent bonds as well as one dative covalent bond. 

Conjecture<====>6138<====>Conjecture In mathematics, a conjecture is a conclusion or proposition based on incomplete information, for which no proof has been found.    Conjectures such as the Riemann hypothesis (still a conjecture) or Fermat's Last Theorem (which was a conjecture until proven in 1995 by Andrew Wiles) have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to prove them. Important examplesFermat's Last Theorem In number theory, Fermat's Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat's conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers a, b, and c can satisfy the equation a n  + b n  = c n  for any integer value of n greater than two. 

Christoph Ludwig Agricola<====>6139<====>Christoph Ludwig AgricolaChristoph Ludwig Agricola (November 5, 1667 – August 8, 1719) was a German landscape painter.  He was born and died at Regensburg (Ratisbon). He trained as a painter in his native country.  He  spent a great part of his life in travel, visiting England, the Netherlands and France, and residing for a considerable period at Naples. His numerous landscapes, chiefly cabinet pictures, are remarkable for fidelity to nature, and especially for their skilful representation of varied phases of climate.   In composition his style shows the influence of Nicolas Poussin, while in light and colour he imitates Claude Lorrain. 

Claudius<====>6140<====>Claudius   Claudius ( ;  ; Classical Latin spelling and reconstructed Classical Latin pronunciation of the name of Claudius: 1 August 10 BC – 13 October 54 AD) was Roman emperor from 41 to 54.  A member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, he was the son of Drusus and Antonia Minor.  He was born at Lugdunum in Gaul, the first (and until Trajan, the only) Roman Emperor to be born outside Italy.  Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age, his family ostracized him and excluded him from public office until his consulship, shared with his nephew Caligula in 37.

Cantor set<====>6172<====>Cantor set In mathematics, the Cantor set is a set of points lying on a single line segment that has a number of remarkable and deep properties.   It was discovered in 1874 by Henry John Stephen Smithand introduced by German mathematician Georg Cantor in 1883.   Through consideration of this set, Cantor and others helped lay the foundations of modern point-set topology.  Although Cantor himself defined the set in a general, abstract way, the most common modern construction is the Cantor ternary set, built by removing the middle thirds of a line segment. 

Cardinal number<====>6173<====>Cardinal number In mathematics, cardinal numbers, or cardinals for short, are a generalization of the natural numbers used to measure the cardinality (size) of sets.  The cardinality of a finite set is a natural number: the number of elements in the set.  The transfinite cardinal numbers describe the sizes of infinite sets. Cardinality is defined in terms of bijective functions.  Two sets have the same cardinality if, and only if, there is a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between the elements of the two sets.  In the case of finite sets, this agrees with the intuitive notion of size. 

Cardinality<====>6174<====>Cardinality In mathematics, the cardinality of a set is a measure of the "number of elements of the set".  For example, the set A = {2, 4, 6} contains 3 elements, and therefore A has a cardinality of 3.  There are two approaches to cardinality – one which compares sets directly using bijections and injections, and another which uses cardinal numbers.  The cardinality of a set is also called its size, when no confusion with other notions of size  is possible. The cardinality of a set A is usually denoted | A |, with a vertical bar on each side; this is the same notation as absolute value and the meaning depends on context. 

Cecil B. DeMille<====>6176<====>Cecil B.  DeMille  Cecil Blount DeMille ( ;  August 12, 1881 – January 21, 1959) was an American filmmaker.  Between 1914 and 1958, he made a total of 70 features, both silent and sound films.   He is acknowledged as a founding father of the cinema of the United States and the most commercially successful producer-director in film history.   His films were distinguished by their epic scale and by his cinematic showmanship.  He made silent films of every genre: social dramas, comedies, Westerns, farces, morality plays, and historical pageants. DeMille began his career as a stage actor in 1900. 

Chinese Islamic cuisine<====>6181<====>Chinese Islamic cuisine  Chinese Islamic cuisine ( , Dungan: Чыңжән цаы or  , Dungan: Ҳуэйзў цаы) is the cuisine of the Hui (ethnic Chinese Muslims) and other Muslims living in China such as Dongxiang, Salar and Bonan as well as Dungans of Central Asia.  HistoryDue to the large Muslim population in western China, many Chinese restaurants cater to, or are run by, Muslims.  Northern Chinese Islamic cuisine originated in China proper.  It is heavily influenced by Beijing cuisine, with nearly all cooking methods identical, and differs only in material due to religious restrictions.  As a result, northern Islamic cuisine is often included in home Beijing cuisine though seldom in east coast restaurants. 

Cantonese cuisine<====>6182<====>Cantonese cuisine Cantonese cuisine (廣東菜), also known as Yue cuisine or Guangdong cuisine, refers to the cuisine of China's Guangdong Province, particularly the provincial capital, Guangzhou (Canton).  Hsiung, Deh-Ta.  Simonds, Nina.  Lowe, Jason.  [2005] (2005).  The food of China: a journey for food lovers.  Bay Books.   .  p17.   It is one of the Eight Culinary Traditions of Chinese cuisine.  Its prominence outside China is due to the large number of emigrants from Guangdong.  Chefs trained in Cantonese cuisine are highly sought after throughout China.Formerly, most Chinese restaurants in the West served largely Cantonese dishes. 

Teochew cuisine<====>6183<====>Teochew cuisine   Teochew cuisine, also known as Chiuchow cuisine, Chaozhou cuisine or Chaoshan cuisine, originated from the Chaoshan region in the eastern part of China's Guangdong Province, which includes the cities of Chaozhou, Shantou and Jieyang.  Teochew cuisine bears more similarities to that of Fujian cuisine, with which it shares some dishes.  This may be due to the similarity of Chaoshan's and Fujian's culture and language and to their geographic proximity.However, Teochew cuisine is also influenced by Cantonese cuisine in its style and technique.  BackgroundTeochew cuisine is well known for its seafood and vegetarian dishes. 

Co-NP<====>6184<====>Co-NP  In computational complexity theory, co-NP is a complexity class.  A decision problem  {\mathcal{X}}  is a member of co-NP if and only if its  complement  \overline{\mathcal{X}}  is in the complexity class NP.  In simple terms, co-NP is the class of problems for which there is a polynomial-time algorithm that can verify no instances (sometimes called counterexamples) given the appropriate certificate.  Equivalently, co-NP is the set of decision problems where the "no" instances can be accepted in polynomial time by a non-deterministic Turing machine.   An example of an NP-complete  problem is the subset sum problem: given a finite set of integers, is there a non-empty subset that sums to zero? To give a proof of a "yes" instance, one must specify a non-empty subset that does sum to zero. 

Chuck Yeager<====>6185<====>Chuck Yeager Charles Elwood "Chuck" Yeager ( ; born  , 1923) is a former United States Air Force general officer, flying ace and record-setting test pilot.  In 1947, he became the first pilot confirmed to have exceeded the speed of sound in level flight. Yeager's career began in World War II as a private in the United States Army Air Forces.   After serving as an aircraft mechanic, in September 1942 he entered enlisted pilot training and upon graduation was promoted to the rank of flight officer (the World War II USAAF equivalent to warrant officer) and became a P-51 fighter pilot. 

Cajun cuisine<====>6186<====>Cajun cuisine  Cajun cuisine ( ,  ) is a style of cooking named for the French-speaking Acadian people deported by the British from Acadia in Canada to the Acadiana region of Louisiana.  It is what could be called a rustic cuisine; locally available ingredients predominate and preparation is simple. An authentic Cajun meal is usually a three-pot affair, with one pot dedicated to the main dish, one dedicated to steamed rice, special made sausages, or some seafood dish, and the third containing whatever vegetable is plentiful or available.  Crawfish, shrimp, and andouille sausage are staple meats used in a variety of dishes. 

Cologne<====>6187<====>Cologne    Cologne ( ;  ,  ,    ) is the largest city in the German federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia and the fourth most populated city in Germany (after Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich).  It is located within the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region which is Germany's largest and one of Europe's major metropolitan areas.  Cologne is about   southwest of North Rhine-Westphalia's capital of Dusseldorf and   northwest of Bonn. Cologne is located on both sides of the Rhine, near Germany's borders with Belgium and the Netherlands.  The city's famous Cologne Cathedral (Kölner Dom) is the seat of the Catholic Archbishop of Cologne. 

Buddhist cuisine<====>6188<====>Buddhist cuisine Buddhist cuisine is an East Asian cuisine which is followed by monks and many believers from areas historically influenced by Chinese Buddhism.  It is vegetarian or vegan, and it is based on the Dharmic concept of ahimsa (non-violence).  Vegetarianism is common in other Dharmic faiths such as Hinduism, Jainism and Sikhism as well as East Asian religions like Taoism.  While monks and a minority of believers are vegetarian year-round, many believers follow the Buddhist vegetarian diet temporarily, similar to Christian Lent. Vegetarian cuisine is known as sùshí (素食) ("vegetarian food"), chúnsù (纯素) ("pure vegetarian") , zhāicài (斋菜) ("lent / fasting food") in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan; đồ chay in Vietnam;   in Japan; sachal eumsik ( "temple food") in Korea; jay (เจ) in Thailand and by other names in many countries.

Constantin von Tischendorf<====>6193<====>Constantin von Tischendorf Lobegott Friedrich Constantin (von) Tischendorf (18 January 1815 – 7 December 1874) was a world leading biblical scholar in his time.  In 1844  he discovered the world's oldest and most complete disputed Bible dating from 325 , with the complete New Testament not discovered before.  This Bible is called Codex Sinaiticus, after the St.  Catherine's Monastery at Mt.  Sinai, where Tischendorf discovered it.   The codex can be seen either in the British Library in London, or as a digitalised version on the Internet.   Textual disputes are resolved when the two oldest books, Codex Sinaiticus (source aleph, 4th AD) and Codex Vaticanus (source beta, 4th  AD), agree with each other. 

Calvin Coolidge<====>6195<====>Calvin Coolidge    John Calvin Coolidge Jr.  ( ; July 4, 1872 – January 5, 1933) was the 30th President of the United States (1923–1929).  A Republican lawyer from Vermont, Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of Massachusetts state politics, eventually becoming governor of that state.  His response to the Boston Police Strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight and gave him a reputation as a man of decisive action.  Soon after, he was elected as the 29th vice president in 1920 and succeeded to the presidency upon the sudden death of Warren G. 

Convention on Biological Diversity<====>6198<====>Convention on Biological Diversity  The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), known informally as the Biodiversity Convention, is a multilateral treaty.  The Convention has three main goals including: the conservation of biological diversity (or biodiversity); the sustainable use of its components; and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources. In other words, its objective is to develop national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.  It is often seen as the key document regarding sustainable development.  The Convention was opened for signature at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro on 5 June 1992 and entered into force on 29 December 1993.

Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution<====>6200<====>Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air PollutionThe Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, often abbreviated as Air Pollution or CLRTAP, is intended to protect the human environment against air pollution and to gradually reduce and prevent air pollution, including long-range transboundary air pollution.  It is implemented by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP), directed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). OverviewThe convention opened for signature on 1979-11-13 and entered into force on 1983-03-16. The Convention, which now has 51 Parties, identifies the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) as its secretariat. 

CITES<====>6201<====>CITES    CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, also known as the Washington Convention) is a multilateral treaty to protect endangered plants and animals.  It was drafted as a result of a resolution adopted in 1963 at a meeting of members of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).  The convention was opened for signature in 1973 and CITES entered into force on 1 July 1975.  Its aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten the survival of the species in the wild, and it accords varying degrees of protection to more than 35,000 species of animals and plants. 

Environmental Modification Convention<====>6203<====>Environmental Modification Convention  The Environmental Modification Convention (ENMOD), formally the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques is an international treaty prohibiting the military or other hostile use of environmental modification techniques having widespread, long-lasting or severe effects.  It opened for signature on 18 May 1977 in Geneva and entered into force on 5 October 1978. The Convention bans weather warfare, which is the use of weather modification techniques for the purposes of inducing damage or destruction.  The Convention on Biological Diversity of 2010 would also ban some forms of weather modification or geoengineering. 

Chaitin's constant<====>6205<====>Chaitin's constant   In the computer science subfield of algorithmic information theory, a Chaitin constant (Chaitin omega number)  or halting probability is a real number that, informally speaking, represents the probability that a randomly constructed program will halt.  These numbers are formed from a construction due to Gregory Chaitin. Although there are infinitely many halting probabilities, it is common to use the letter Ω to refer to them as if there were only one.   Because Ω depends on the program encoding used, it is sometimes called Chaitin's construction instead of Chaitin's constant when not referring to any specific encoding. 

Computable number<====>6206<====>Computable numberIn mathematics, computable numbers are the real numbers that can be computed to within any desired precision by a finite, terminating algorithm.  They are also known as the recursive numbers or the computable reals or recursive reals. Equivalent definitions can be given using μ-recursive functions, Turing machines, or λ-calculus as the formal representation of algorithms.  The computable numbers form a real closed field and can be used in the place of real numbers for many, but not all, mathematical purposes. Informal definition using a Turing machine as exampleIn the following, Marvin Minsky defines the numbers to be computed in a manner similar to those defined by Alan Turing in 1936; i. 

Electric current<====>6207<====>Electric current  An electric current is a flow of electric charge. In electric circuits this charge is often carried by moving electrons in a wire.  It can also be carried by ions in an electrolyte, or by both ions and electrons such as in an ionised gas (plasma).  The SI unit for measuring an electric current is the ampere, which is the flow of electric charge across a surface at the rate of one coulomb per second.  Electric current is measured using a device called an ammeter.    Electric currents cause Joule heating, which creates light in incandescent light bulbs. 

Charles Ancillon<====>6208<====>Charles Ancillon Charles Ancillon (28 July 1659 5 July 1715) "Ancillon, Charles" in The New Encyclopædia Britannica.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. , 15th edn. , 1992, Vol.  1, p.  378.   was a French jurist and diplomat. Ancillon was born in Metz into a distinguished family of Huguenots.   His father, David Ancillon (1617–1692), was obliged to leave France on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and became pastor of the French Protestant community in Berlin.    Ancillon studied law at Marburg, Geneva and Paris, where he was called to the bar. 

Clark Ashton Smith<====>6210<====>Clark Ashton Smith   Clark Ashton Smith (January 13, 1893 – August 14, 1961) was a self-educated American poet, sculptor, painter and author of fantasy, horror and science fiction short stories.  He achieved early local recognition, largely through the enthusiasm of George Sterling, for traditional verse in the vein of Swinburne.  As a poet, Smith is grouped with the West Coast Romantics alongside Joaquin Miller, Sterling, Nora May French, and remembered as "The Last of the Great Romantics" and "The Bard of Auburn". Smith was one of "the big three of Weird Tales, with Robert E.  Howard and H. 

Context-sensitive grammar<====>6211<====>Context-sensitive grammarA context-sensitive grammar (CSG) is a formal grammar in which the left-hand sides and right-hand sides of any production rules may be surrounded by a context of terminal and nonterminal symbols.  Context-sensitive grammars are more general than context-free grammars, in the sense that there are languages that can be described by CSG but not by context-free grammars.  Context-sensitive grammars are less general (in the same sense) than unrestricted grammars.  Thus, CSG are positioned between context-free and unrestricted grammars in the Chomsky hierarchy. A formal language that can be described by a context-sensitive grammar, or, equivalently, by a noncontracting grammar or a linear bounded automaton, is called a context-sensitive language. 

Context-sensitive language<====>6212<====>Context-sensitive language In theoretical computer science, a context-sensitive language is a formal language that can be defined by a context-sensitive grammar (and equivalently by a noncontracting grammar).   Context-sensitive is one of the four types of grammars in the Chomsky hierarchy. Computational propertiesComputationally, a context-sensitive language is equivalent with a linear bounded nondeterministic Turing machine, also called a linear bounded automaton.  That is a non-deterministic Turing machine with a tape of only kn cells, where n is the size of the input and k is a constant associated with the machine.  This means that every formal language that can be decided by such a machine is a context-sensitive language, and every context-sensitive language can be decided by such a machine. 

Chinese room<====>6216<====>Chinese room The Chinese room argument holds that a program cannot give a computer a "mind", "understanding" or "consciousness",  regardless of how intelligently or human-like the program may make the computer behave.   The argument was first presented by philosopher John Searle in his paper, "Minds, Brains, and Programs", published in Behavioral and Brain Sciences in 1980.  It has been widely discussed in the years since.   The centerpiece of the argument is a thought experiment known as the Chinese room.    The argument is directed against the philosophical positions of functionalism and computationalism,  which hold that the mind may be viewed as an information-processing system operating on formal symbols. 

Circle<====>6220<====>CircleA circle is a simple closed shape.  It is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the  centre;  equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves so that its distance from a given point is constant.  The distance between any of the points and the centre is called the radius.  This article is about circles in Euclidean geometry, and, in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted. A circle is a simple closed curve which divides the plane into two regions: an interior and an exterior. 

Cardinal (Catholic Church)<====>6221<====>Cardinal (Catholic Church)  A cardinal ( , literally Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church) is a senior ecclesiastical leader, considered a Prince of the Church, and usually (now always for those created when still within the voting age-range) an ordained bishop of the Roman Catholic Church.  The cardinals of the Church are collectively known as the College of Cardinals.  The duties of the cardinals include attending the meetings of the College and making themselves available individually or in groups to the Pope as requested.  Most have additional duties, such as leading a diocese or archdiocese or managing a department of the Roman Curia. 

Cantigas de Santa Maria<====>6225<====>Cantigas de Santa Maria The Cantigas de Santa Maria ("Canticles of Holy Mary";  ),  , are 420 poems with musical notation, written in the medieval Galician-Portuguese language during the reign of Alfonso X El Sabio (1221–1284) and often attributed to him. It is one of the largest collections of monophonic (solo) songs from the Middle Ages and is characterized by the mention of the Virgin Mary in every song, while every tenth song is a hymn. The Cantigas have survived in four manuscript codices: two at El Escorial, one at Madrid's National Library, and one in Florence, Italy. 

Claudio Monteverdi<====>6226<====>Claudio Monteverdi  Claudio Giovanni Antonio Monteverdi ( ; 15 May 1567 (baptized) – 29 November 1643) was an Italian composer, string player and choirmaster.  A composer of both secular and sacred music, and a pioneer in the development of opera, he is considered a crucial transitional figure between the Renaissance and the Baroque periods of music history. Born in Cremona, where he undertook his first musical studies and compositions, Monteverdi developed his career first at the court of Mantua (c.  1590–1613) and then until his death in the Republic of Venice where he was maestro di capella at the basilica of San Marco. 

Colossus computer<====>6229<====>Colossus computer  Colossus was a set of computers developed by British codebreakers in the years 1943–1945 to help in the cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher.  Colossus used thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) to perform Boolean and counting operations.  Colossus is thus regarded  as the world's first programmable, electronic, digital computer, although it was programmed by switches and plugs and not by a stored program.  Colossus was designed by research telephone engineer Tommy Flowers to solve a problem posed by mathematician Max Newman at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park.  Alan Turing's use of probability in cryptanalysis  contributed to its design. 

Canadian Shield<====>6230<====>Canadian Shield The Canadian Shield, also called the Laurentian Plateau, or   (French), is a large area of exposed Precambrian igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks (geological shield) that forms the ancient geological core of the North American continent (the North American Craton or Laurentia).  Composed of igneous rock resulting from its long volcanic history, the area is covered by a thin layer of soil.  Stephen Marshak.  Essentials of Geology.  3rd ed.   With a deep, common, joined bedrock region in eastern and central Canada, it stretches north from the Great Lakes to the Arctic Ocean, covering over half of Canada; it also extends south into the northern reaches of the United States. 

Comic book<====>6231<====>Comic book  A comic book or comicbook,  also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes.  Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form.  Although   some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s.The first modern comic book, Famous Funnies, was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. 

Connected space<====>6233<====>Connected space {{multiple image }}In topology and related branches of mathematics, a connected space is a topological space that cannot be represented as the union of two or more disjoint nonempty open subsets.  Connectedness is one of the principal topological properties that are used to distinguish topological spaces. A subset of a topological space X is a connected set if it is a connected space when viewed as a subspace of X. Formal definitionA topological space X is said to be disconnected if it is the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets.  Otherwise, X is said to be connected. 

Cell nucleus<====>6235<====>Cell nucleus  In cell biology, the  nucleus (pl.  nuclei; from Latin   or  , meaning kernel or seed) is a membrane-enclosed organelle found in eukaryotic cells.  Eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types, such as mammalian red blood cells, have no nuclei, and a few others have many.  Human skeletal muscle cells have more than one nucleus, as do eukaryotes like fungi.  Cell nuclei contain most of the cell's genetic material, organized as multiple long linear DNA molecules in complex with a large variety of proteins, such as histones, to form chromosomes. 

Christmas<====>6237<====>Christmas   Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ,  Martindale, Cyril Charles. "Christmas".  The Catholic Encyclopedia.  Vol.  3.  New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908.   observed primarily on December 25   Several branches of Eastern Christianity that use the Julian calendar also celebrate on December 25 according to that calendar, which is now January 7 on the Gregorian calendar.  Armenian Churches observed the nativity on January 6 even before the Gregorian calendar originated.  Most Armenian Christians use the Gregorian calendar, still celebrating Christmas Day on January 6. 

Contraction mapping<====>6239<====>Contraction mappingIn mathematics, a contraction mapping, or contraction or contractor, on a metric space (M,d) is a function f from M to itself, with the property that there is some nonnegative real number  0\leq k   such that for all x and y in M, d(f(x),f(y))\leq k\,d(x,y).  The smallest such value of k is called the Lipschitz constant of f.   Contractive maps are sometimes called Lipschitzian maps.   If the above condition is instead satisfied fork ≤ 1, then the mapping is said to be a non-expansive map. More generally, the idea of a contractive mapping can be defined for maps between metric spaces. 

Covalent bond<====>6246<====>Covalent bond   A covalent bond, also called a molecular bond, is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms.  These electron pairs are known as shared pairs or bonding pairs, and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is known as covalent bonding.    For many molecules, the sharing of electrons allows each atom to attain the equivalent of a full outer shell, corresponding to a stable electronic configuration. Covalent bonding includes many kinds of interactions, including σ-bonding, π-bonding,  metal-to-metal bonding,  agostic interactions, bent bonds, and three-center two-electron bonds. 

Condensation polymer<====>6247<====>Condensation polymer Condensation polymers are any kind of polymers formed through a condensation reaction—where molecules join together—losing small molecules as byproducts such as water or methanol, as opposed to addition polymers which involve the reaction of unsaturated monomers.  Condensation polymerization, a form of step-growth polymerization, is a process by which two molecules join together, resulting in loss of small molecules which are often water.  The type of end product resulting from a condensation polymerization is dependent onMonomers with only one reactive group do not padlock a growing chain, and thus give end products with a lower molecular weight.

Professional certification<====>6251<====>Professional certification  Professional certification, trade certification, or professional designation, often called simply certification or qualification, is a designation earned by a person to assure qualification to perform a job or task.  Not all certifications that use post-nominal letters are an acknowledgement of educational achievement, or an agency appointed to safeguard the public interest. OverviewA certification is a third-party attestation of an individual's level of knowledge or proficiency in a certain industry or profession.  They are granted by authorities in the field, such as professional societies and universities, or by private certificate-granting agencies.  Most certifications are time-limited; some expire after a period of time (e. 

Carl Menger<====>6255<====>Carl Menger   Carl Menger ( ;  ; February 23, 1840 – February 26, 1921) was an Austrian economist and the founder of the Austrian School of economics.  Menger contributed to the development of the theory of marginalism (marginal utility),  which rejected the cost-of-production theories of value, such as were developed by the classical economists such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo.  Menger used his “Subjective Theory of Value” to arrive at what he considered one of the most powerful insights in economics: both sides gain from exchange.  BiographyMenger was born in the city of Neu-Sandez in Galicia, Austrian Empire, which is now Nowy Sącz  in Poland.

Civilization<====>6258<====>Civilization   A civilization (UK and US) or civilisation (UK variant) is any complex society characterized by urban development, social stratification imposed by a cultural elite, symbolic systems of communication (for example, writing systems), and a perceived separation from and domination over the natural environment.Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including centralization, the domestication of both humans and other organisms, specialization of labour, culturally ingrained ideologies of progress and supremacism, monumental architecture, taxation, societal dependence upon farming and expansionism. 

Civilization (video game)<====>6259<====>Civilization (video game)    Sid Meier's Civilization is the first in a series of turn-based "4X"-type strategy video game created by Sid Meier and Bruce Shelley for MicroProse in 1991.    The game's objective is to "Build an empire to stand the test of time": it begins in 4000 BC and the players attempt to expand and develop their empires through the ages from the ancient era until modern and near-future times. Civilization was originally developed for MS-DOS running on a PC.  It has undergone numerous revisions for various platforms (including Windows, Macintosh, Amiga, Atari ST, Super NES, Sega Saturn, PlayStation and N-Gage) and now exists in several versions. 

Claude Debussy<====>6260<====>Claude Debussy    Achille-Claude Debussy ( ,   22 August 1862 – 25 March 1918), known since the 1890s as Claude-Achille Debussy or Claude Debussy, Born Achille-Claude Debussy, he was known as "Achille" during his student days, changed his forename to "Claude-Achille" around 1890, and after 1894 was known simply as "Claude Debussy" (Fulcher, Jane F.  Debussy and His World.  Princeton University Press, 2001.  p.  101. ).   was a French composer.  He and Maurice Ravel were the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music, though Debussy disliked the term when applied to his compositions.

Cultural imperialism<====>6267<====>Cultural imperialismCultural imperialism comprises the cultural aspects of imperialism.  Imperialism here refers to the creation and maintenance of unequal relationships between civilizations, favoring the more powerful civilization.  Thus, cultural imperialism is the practice of promoting and imposing a culture, usually that of a politically powerful nation, over a less powerful society; in other words, the cultural hegemony of industrialized or economically influential countries which determine general cultural values and standardize civilizations throughout the world.  The term is employed especially in the fields of history, cultural studies, and postcolonial theory.  It is usually used in a pejorative sense, often in conjunction with calls to reject such influence. 

Chemical reaction<====>6271<====>Chemical reaction A chemical reaction is a process that leads to the transformation of one set of chemical substances to another.   Classically, chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, with no change to the nuclei (no change to the elements present), and can often be described by a chemical equation.  Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes can occur. The substance (or substances) initially involved in a chemical reaction are called reactants or reagents.

Casiquiare canal<====>6276<====>Casiquiare canal  The Casiquiare river  is a distributary of the upper Orinoco flowing southward into the Rio Negro, in Venezuela, South America.  As such, it forms a unique natural canal between the Orinoco and Amazon river systems.  It is the world's largest river of the kind that links two major river systems, a so-called bifurcation.  The area forms a water divide, more dramatically at regional flood stage. DiscoveryIn 1744 a Jesuit priest named Father Roman, while ascending the Orinoco River, met some Portuguese slave-traders from the settlements on the Rio Negro.  He accompanied them on their return, by way of the Casiquiare canal, and afterwards retraced his route to the Orinoco. 

Capetian dynasty<====>6279<====>Capetian dynasty    The Capetian dynasty ( ), also known as the House of France, is a dynasty of Frankish origin, founded by Hugh Capet.  It is among the largest and oldest royal houses in Europe and the world, and consists of Hugh Capet's male-line descendants.  The senior line ruled in France as the House of Capet from the election of Hugh Capet in 987 until the death of Charles IV in 1328.  That line was succeeded by cadet branches, the Houses of Valois and then Bourbon, which ruled until the French Revolution. The dynasty had a crucial role in the formation of the French state. 

Cuboctahedron<====>6280<====>Cuboctahedron  In geometry, a cuboctahedron is a polyhedron with 8 triangular faces and 6 square faces.  A cuboctahedron has 12 identical vertices, with 2 triangles and 2 squares meeting at each, and 24 identical edges, each separating a triangle from a square.  As such, it is a quasiregular polyhedron, i. e.  an Archimedean solid that is not only vertex-transitive but also edge-transitive. Its dual polyhedron is the rhombic dodecahedron. The cuboctahedron was probably known to Plato: Heron's Definitiones quotes Archimedes as saying that Plato knew of a solid made of 8 triangles and 6 squares.  Other namesHeptaparallelohedron (Buckminster Fuller)Fuller applied the name "Dymaxion" to this shape, used in an early version of the Dymaxion map.

Cube<====>6285<====>Cube  In geometry, a cube  is a three-dimensional solid object bounded by six square faces, facets or sides, with three meeting at each vertex. The cube is the only regular hexahedron and is one of the five Platonic solids.  It has 6 faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices. The cube is also a square parallelepiped, an equilateral cuboid and a right rhombohedron.  It is a regular square prism in three orientations, and a trigonal trapezohedron in four orientations. The cube is dual to the octahedron.  It has cubical or octahedral symmetry. Orthogonal projectionsThe cube has four special orthogonal projections, centered, on a vertex, edges, face and normal to its vertex figure. 

Commuter rail<====>6286<====>Commuter rail Commuter rail,  also called suburban rail, is a passenger rail transport service that primarily operates between a city centre and middle to outer suburbs beyond 15 km (10 miles) and commuter towns or other locations that draw large numbers of commuters—people who travel on a daily basis.  Trains operate following a schedule at speeds varying from 50 to 200 km/h (30 to 125 mph).  Distance charges or zone pricing may be used. Non-English names include Treno suburbano in Italian, Cercanías in Spanish, Rodalies in Catalan, Proastiakos in Greek, S-Bahn in German (although Regionalbahn or stopping services occasionally also operate as commuter trains), Train de banlieue in French, Příměstský vlak or Esko in Czech, Elektrichka in Russian, Pociąg podmiejski  in Polish and Pendeltåg in Swedish. 

Cambridgeshire<====>6288<====>Cambridgeshire    Cambridgeshire (  or  ; abbreviated Cambs. ),  is an East Anglian county in England, bordering Lincolnshire to the north, Norfolk to the north-east, Suffolk to the east, Essex and Hertfordshire to the south, and Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire to the west.  The city of Cambridge is the county town.  Modern Cambridgeshire was formed in 1974 as an amalgamation of the counties of Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely and Huntingdon and Peterborough, the former covering the historic county of Cambridgeshire (including the Isle of Ely), and the latter covering the historic county of Huntingdonshire and the Soke of Peterborough area of historic Northamptonshire. 

Christian Goldbach<====>6290<====>Christian Goldbach Christian Goldbach (March 18, 1690 – November 20, 1764) was a German mathematician who also studied law.  He is remembered today for Goldbach's conjecture. BiographyBorn in the Duchy of Prussia's capital Königsberg, part of Brandenburg-Prussia, Goldbach was the son of a pastor.  He studied at the Royal Albertus University. After finishing his studies he went on long educational voyages from 1710 to 1724 through Europe, visiting other German states, England, Holland, Italy, and France, meeting with many famous mathematicians, such as Gottfried Leibniz, Leonhard Euler, and Nicholas I Bernoulli.  Back in Königsberg he got acquainted with Georg Bernhard Bilfinger and Jakob Hermann. 

Roman censor<====>6291<====>Roman censor   The censor was an officer in ancient Rome who was responsible for maintaining the census, supervising public morality, and overseeing certain aspects of the government's finances.  The censors' regulation of public morality is the origin of the modern meaning of the words "censor" and "censorship".  Early history of the magistracyThe census was first instituted by Servius Tullius, sixth king of Rome.  After the abolition of the monarchy and the founding of the  Republic, the consuls had responsibility for the census until 443 BC.  In 442 BC, no consuls were elected, but tribunes with consular power were appointed instead; this was a move by the plebeians to try to attain higher magistracies: only patricians could be elected consuls, while some military tribunes were plebeians. 

Convex set<====>6292<====>Convex setIn convex geometry, a convex set is a subset of an affine space that is closed under convex combinations.   More specifically, in a Euclidean space, a convex region is a region where, for every pair of points within the region, every point on the straight line segment that joins the pair of points is also within the region.    For example, a solid cube is a convex set, but anything that is hollow or has an indent, for example, a crescent shape, is not convex. The boundary of a convex set is always a convex curve. 

Cairo<====>6293<====>Cairo   Cairo (   ;    ,  ,    ) is the capital and largest city of Egypt.  The city's metropolitan area is the largest in the Middle East and the Arab world, and the 15th-largest in the world, and is associated with ancient Egypt, as the famous Giza pyramid complex and the ancient city of Memphis are located in its geographical area.  Located near the Nile Delta,modern Cairo was founded in 969 CE by the Fatimid dynasty, but the land composing the present-day city was the site of ancient national capitals whose remnants remain visible in parts of Old Cairo. 

Chaos theory<====>6295<====>Chaos theory Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics and it is focused on the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions.  'Chaos' is an interdisciplinary theory stating that within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity, fractals, self-organization, and reliance on programming at the initial point known as sensitive dependence on initial conditions.  The butterfly effect describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state, e. g.  a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a hurricane in Texas. 

Cupola<====>6298<====>Cupola In architecture, a cupola   is a relatively small, most often dome-like, tall structure on top of a building.Often used to provide a lookout or to admit light and air, it usually crowns a larger roof or dome.  The word derives, via Italian, from the lower Latin cupula (classical Latin cupella from the Greek κύπελλον kupellon) "small cup" (Latin cupa) indicating a vault resembling an upside down cup.    The cupola is a development during the Renaissance of the oculus, an ancient device found in Roman architecture, but being weatherproof was superior for the wetter climates of northern Europe. 

Chupacabra<====>6299<====>Chupacabra    The chupacabra or chupacabras ( , literally "goat-sucker"; from chupar, "to suck", and cabra, "goat") is a legendary creature in the folklore of parts of the Americas, with its first purported sightings reported in Puerto Rico.   The name comes from the animal's reported habit of attacking and drinking the blood of livestock, especially goats. Physical descriptions of the creature vary.  It is purportedly a heavy creature, the size of a small bear, with a row of spines reaching from the neck to the base of the tail. Eyewitness sightings have been claimed in Puerto Rico, and have since been reported as far north as Maine, and as far south as Chile, and even being spotted outside the Americas in countries like Russia and the Philippines, but many of the reports have been disregarded as uncorroborated or lacking evidence. 

Cayuga Lake<====>6309<====>Cayuga Lake Cayuga Lake (  or  )  is the longest of central New York's glacial Finger Lakes, and is the second largest in surface area (marginally smaller than Seneca Lake) and second largest in volume.   It is just under   long.   Its average width is 1. 7 miles (2. 7 km), and it is   at its widest point near Aurora.   It is approximately   at its deepest point. LocationThe city of Ithaca, site of Ithaca College and Cornell University, is located at the southern end of Cayuga Lake. Villages and settlements along the east shore of Cayuga Lake include Myers, King Ferry, Aurora, Levanna, Union Springs, and Cayuga. 

Columbia University<====>6310<====>Columbia University    Columbia University (Columbia; officially Columbia University in the City of New York), established in 1754, is a private Ivy League research university in Upper Manhattan, New York City.  Columbia contains the oldest college in the state of New York and is the fifth chartered institution of higher learning in the United States, making it one of nine colonial colleges founded prior to the Declaration of Independence.   It was established as King's College by royal charter of George II of Great Britain and renamed Columbia College in 1784 following the American Revolutionary War. 

Cell wall<====>6312<====>Cell wallA cell wall is a structural layer surrounding some types of cells, situated outside the cell membrane.  It can be tough, flexible, and sometimes rigid.  It provides the cell with both structural support and protection, and also acts as a filtering mechanism.  Cell walls are present in most prokaryotes (except mycoplasma bacteria), in algae, plants and fungi but rarely in other eukaryotes including animals.   A major function is to act as pressure vessels, preventing over-expansion of the cell when water enters. The composition of cell walls varies between species and may depend on cell type and developmental stage. 

Classical element<====>6313<====>Classical element  Classical elements typically refer to the concepts in ancient Greece of earth, water, air, fire, and aether, which were proposed to explain the nature and complexity of all matter in terms of simpler substances.    Ancient cultures in Egypt, Babylonia, Japan, Tibet, and India had similar lists, sometimes referring in local languages to "air" as "wind" and the fifth element as "void".   The Chinese Wu Xing system lists Wood (  mù), Fire (  huǒ), Earth (  tǔ), Metal (  jīn), and Water (  shuǐ), though these are described more as energies or transitions than as types of material. 

Fire (classical element)<====>6314<====>Fire (classical element) Fire has been an important part of all cultures and religions from pre-history to modern day and was vital to the development of civilization.  It has been regarded in many different contexts throughout history, but especially as a metaphysical constant of the world. Greek and Roman traditionFire is one of the four classical elements in ancient Greek philosophy and science.   It was commonly associated with the qualities of energy, assertiveness, and passion.   In one Greek myth, Prometheus stole fire from the gods to protect the otherwise helpless humans, but was punished for this charity. 

Air (classical element)<====>6315<====>Air (classical element) Air   is one of the four classical elements in ancient Greek philosophy and in Western alchemy. Greek and Roman traditionAccording to Plato, it is associated with the octahedron; air is considered to be both hot and wet.  The ancient Greeks used two words for air: aer meant the dim lower atmosphere, and aether meant the bright upper atmosphere above the clouds.   Plato, for instance writes that "So it is with air: there is the brightest variety which we call aether, the muddiest which we call mist and darkness, and other kinds for which we have no name. 

Water (classical element)<====>6316<====>Water (classical element)  Water is one of the elements in ancient Greek philosophy, in the Asian Indian system Panchamahabhuta, and in the Chinese cosmological and physiological system Wu Xing.  In contemporary esoteric traditions, it is commonly associated with the qualities of emotion and intuition. Greek and Roman traditionWater was one of many  archai proposed by the Pre-socratics, most of whom tried to reduce all things to a single substance.  However, Empedocles of Acragas (c.  495 – c.  435 BC) selected four archai for his four roots: air, fire, water and earth.  Empedocles roots became the four classical elements of Greek philosophy. 

Earth (classical element)<====>6317<====>Earth (classical element) Earth is one of the classical elements, in some systems numbering four along with air, fire, and water. European traditionEarth is one of the four classical elements in ancient Greek philosophy and science.   It was commonly associated with qualities of heaviness, matter and the terrestrial world.   Due to the hero cults, and chthonic underworld deities, the element of earth is also associated with the sensual aspects of both life and death in later occultism. Empedocles of Acragasproposed four archai by which to understand the cosmos: fire, air, water, and earth. 

Blue Jam<====>6319<====>Blue Jam   Blue Jam is an ambient radio comedy programme created and directed by Chris Morris.  It aired on BBC Radio 1 in the early hours of the morning from 1997 to 1999. The programme gained cult status due to its unique mix of surreal monologue, music, synthesised voices, heavily edited broadcasts and recurring sketches.  It featured vocal performances of Kevin Eldon, Julia Davis, Mark Heap, David Cann and Amelia Bullmore, with Morris himself delivering disturbing monologues, one of which was revamped and made into the BAFTA-winning short film My Wrongs #8245–8249 & 117.  Writers who contributed to the programme included Graham Linehan, Arthur Mathews, Peter Baynham, David Quantick, Jane Bussmann, Robert Katz and the cast. 

Channel 4<====>6321<====>Channel 4Channel 4 is a British public-service television broadcaster that began transmission on 2 November 1982.  Although largely commercially self-funded, it is ultimately publicly owned; originally a subsidiary of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA),  the station is now owned and operated by Channel Four Television Corporation, a public corporation of the Department for Culture, Media & Sport,  which was established in 1990 and came into operation in 1993.  With the conversion of the Wenvoe transmitter group in Wales to digital on 31 March 2010, Channel 4 became a UK-wide TV channel for the first time. 

Carolina parakeet<====>6322<====>Carolina parakeet   The Carolina parakeet (Conuropsis carolinensis) or Carolina conure was a small green neotropical parrot with a bright yellow head, reddish orange face and pale beak native to the eastern, midwest and plains states of the United States and was the only indigenous parrot within its range, as well as one of only two parrots native to the United States (the other being the thick-billed parrot).  It was found from southern New York and Wisconsin to Kentucky, Tennessee and the Gulf of Mexico, from the Atlantic seaboard to as far west as eastern Colorado.  It lived in old-growth forests along rivers and in swamps. 

Collective trauma<====>6324<====>Collective trauma A collective trauma is a traumatic psychological effect shared by a group of people of any size, up to and including an entire society.  Traumatic events witnessed by an entire society can stir up collective sentiment, often resulting in a shift in that society's culture and mass actions.   Well known collective traumas include: The Holocaust,  the Armenian Genocide, Slavery in the United States,  the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,  the Trail of Tears,  the Assassination of John F.  Kennedy in the United States, the MS Estonia in Sweden, the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, and various others. 

Church (building)<====>6325<====>Church (building)  A church building or church house, often simply called a church, is a building used for Christian religious activities, particularly for worship services.  The term in its architectural sense is most often used by Christians to refer to their religious buildings, but it is sometimes used (by analogy) to refer to buildings of other religions.   In traditional Christian architecture, the church is often arranged in the shape of a Christian cross.  When viewed from plan view the longest part of a cross is represented by the aisle and the junction of the cross is located at the altar area. 

Childe's Tomb<====>6326<====>Childe's TombChilde's Tomb is a granite cross on Dartmoor, Devon, England.  Although not in its original form, it is more elaborate than most of the crosses on Dartmoor, being raised upon a constructed base, and it is known that a kistvaen is underneath. A well-known legend attached to the site, first recorded in 1630 by Tristram Risdon, concerns a wealthy hunter, Childe, who became lost in a snow storm and supposedly died there despite disembowelling his horse and climbing into its body for protection.  The legend relates that Childe left a note of some sort saying that whoever found and buried his body would inherit his lands at Plymstock. 

Cognate<====>6328<====>Cognate  In linguistics, cognates are words that have a common etymological origin  .  In etymology, the cognate category excludes doublets and loanwords.  The word cognate derives from the Latin noun cognatus, which means "blood relative"  . CharacteristicsCognates do not need to have the same meaning, which may have changed as the languages developed separately.  For example English   and Dutch   or German   ("to die") all derive from the same Proto-Germanic root,   ("die").  English   and German   ("table"), with their flat surfaces, both come from Latin  , but their later meanings are different. 

Chromatography<====>6329<====>Chromatography  Chromatography is a laboratory technique for the separation of a mixture. The mixture is dissolved in a fluid called the mobile phase, which carries it through a structure holding another material called the stationary phase.  The various constituents of the mixture travel at different speeds, causing them to separate.  The separation is based on differential partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases.  Subtle differences in a compound's partition coefficient result in differential retention on the stationary phase and thus affect the separation.  Chromatography may be preparative or analytical.  The purpose of preparative chromatography is to separate the components of a mixture for later use, and is thus a form of purification. 

Clement Martyn Doke<====>6330<====>Clement Martyn Doke    Clement Martyn Doke (16 May 1893 in Bristol, United Kingdom – 24 February 1980 in East London, South Africa) was a South African linguist working mainly on African languages.  Realizing that the grammatical structures of Bantu languages are quite different from those of European languages, he was one of the first African linguists of his time to abandon the Euro-centric approach to language description for a more locally grounded one.  A most prolific writer, he published a string of grammars, several dictionaries, comparative work, and a history of Bantu linguistics. Missionary in LambalandThe Doke family had been engaged in missionary activity for the Baptist Church for some generations. 

Carl Meinhof<====>6331<====>Carl Meinhof  Carl Friedrich Michael Meinhof (July 23, 1857 – February 11, 1944) was a German linguist and one of the first linguists to study African languages. Early years and careerMeinhof was born in Barzwitz near Rügenwalde in the Province of Pomerania.  He studied at the University of Tübingen  and at the University of Greifswald.  In 1905 he became professor at the School of Oriental Studies in Berlin.  On 5 May 1933 he became a member of the Nazi Party. WorksHis most notable work was developing comparative grammar studies of the Bantu languages, building on the pioneering work of Wilhelm Bleek. 

Cucurbitaceae<====>6335<====>Cucurbitaceae The Cucurbitaceae, also called cucurbits and the gourd family, are a plant family consisting of about 965 species in around 95 genera,    the most important of which are:Cucurbita – squash, pumpkin, zucchini, some gourdsLagenaria – calabash, and others that are inedibleCitrullus – watermelon (C.  lanatus, C.  colocynthis) and othersCucumis – cucumber (C.  sativus), various melonsLuffa – the common name is also luffa, sometimes spelled loofah (when fully ripened, two species of this fibrous fruit are the source of the loofah scrubbing sponge)The plants in this family are grown around the tropics and in temperate areas, where those with edible fruits were among the earliest cultivated plants in both the Old and New Worlds. 

Chorded keyboard<====>6336<====>Chorded keyboardA keyset or chorded keyboard (also called a chorded keyset, chord keyboard or chording keyboard) is a computer input device that allows the user to enter characters or commands formed by pressing several keys together, like playing a "chord" on a piano.  The large number of combinations available from a small number of keys allows text or commands to be entered with one hand, leaving the other hand free.  A secondary advantage is that it can be built into a device (such as a pocket-sized computer or a bicycle handlebar) that is too small to contain a normal-sized keyboard. 

Carolyn Beug<====>6337<====>Carolyn Beug Carolyn Ann Mayer-Beug (December 11, 1952 – September 11, 2001) was a filmmaker and video producer from Santa Monica, California.  She died in the September 11 attacks. CareerIn addition to her work as video producer, Beug also directed three music videos for country singer Dwight Yoakam: "Ain't That Lonely Yet", "A Thousand Miles from Nowhere" and "Fast as You. " Beug co-directed the former two videos with Yoakam and was the sole director of the latter video.  She won an MTV Video Music award for the Van Halen music video of the song "Right Now", which she produced. 

Cell biology<====>6339<====>Cell biology   Cell biology or cytology or cytobiology, (from the Greek κυτος, kytos, "vessel") is a branch of biology that studies the different structures and functions of the cell and focuses mainly on the idea of the cell as the basic unit of life.  Cell biology explains the structure, organization of the organelles they contain, their physiological properties, metabolic processes, signaling pathways, life cycle, and interactions with their environment.  This is done both on a microscopic and molecular level as it encompasses prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells.  Knowing the components of cells and how cells work is fundamental to all biological sciences; it is also essential for research in bio-medical fields such as cancer, and other diseases. 

Canadian English<====>6340<====>Canadian English   Canadian English (CanE, CE, en-CA ) is the set of varieties of the English language native to Canada.  According to the 2011 census, English was the first language of approximately 19 million Canadians, or 57% of the population; the remainder of the population were native speakers of Canadian French (22%) or other languages (allophones, 21%).   A larger number, 28 million people, reported using English as their dominant language.   82% of Canadians outside the province of Quebec reported speaking English natively, but within Quebec the figure was just 7. 7% as most of its residents are native speakers of Quebec French. 

Czech language<====>6343<====>Czech language  Czech ( ; čeština  ), historically also Bohemian    ( ;  lingua Bohemica in Latin), is a West Slavic language of the Czech–Slovak group.   Spoken by over 10 million people, it serves as the official language of the Czech Republic.  Czech is closely related to Slovak, to the point of mutual intelligibility to a very high degree.   Like other Slavic languages, Czech is a fusional language with a rich system of morphology and relatively flexible word order.  Its vocabulary has been extensively influenced by Latin  and German. 

Capsid<====>6344<====>Capsid A capsid is the protein shell of a virus.  It consists of several oligomeric structural subunits made of protein called protomers.  The observable 3-dimensional morphological subunits, which may or may not correspond to individual proteins, are called capsomeres.   The capsid encloses the genetic material of the virus. Capsids are broadly classified according to their structure.   The majority of viruses have capsids with either helical or icosahedral   structure.   Some viruses, such as bacteriophages, have developed more complicated structures due to constraints of elasticity and electrostatics.    The icosahedral shape, which has 20 equilateral triangular faces, approximates a sphere, while the helical shape resembles the shape of a spring, taking the space of a cylinder but not being a cylinder itself. 

Chloramphenicol<====>6346<====>Chloramphenicol  Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic useful for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections.This includes as an eye ointment to treat conjunctivitis.   By mouth or by injection into a vein, it is used to treat meningitis, plague, cholera, and typhoid fever.   Its use by mouth or by injection is only recommended when safer antibiotics cannot be used and if used, monitoring both blood levels of the medication and blood cell levels every two days is recommended during treatment.   Common side effects include bone marrow suppression, nausea, and diarrhoea. 

Cut-up technique<====>6347<====>Cut-up technique The cut-up technique (or découpé in French) is an aleatory literary technique in which a text is cut up and rearranged to create a new text.  The concept can be traced to at least the Dadaists of the 1920s, but was popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by writer William S.  Burroughs, and has since been used in a wide variety of contexts. TechniqueThe cut-up and the closely associated fold-in are the two main techniques:Cut-up is performed by taking a finished and fully linear text and cutting it in pieces with a few or single words on each piece. 

Cretinism<====>6352<====>Cretinism  Cretinism is a condition of severely stunted physical and mental growth owing to untreated congenital deficiency of thyroid hormone (congenital hypothyroidism) usually owing to maternal hypothyroidism. CauseAround the world, the most common cause of congenital hypothyroidism is iodine deficiency.  Cretinism is therefore most probably due to a diet deficient in iodine.  It has affected many people worldwide and continues to be a major public health problem in many countries.  Iodine is an essential trace element, necessary primarily for the synthesis of thyroid hormones.  Iodine deficiency is the most common preventable cause of brain damage worldwide. 

Council of Trent<====>6354<====>Council of Trent   The Council of Trent ( ), held between 1545 and 1563 in Trent, or Trento, in northern Italy.  It was an ecumenical council of the Catholic Church.   Prompted by the Protestant Reformation, it has been described as the embodiment of the Counter-Reformation.  "Trent, Council of" in Cross, F.  L.  (ed. ) The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, Oxford University Press, 2005 ( ).   The Council issued condemnations of what it defined to be heresies committed by Protestantism and key statements and clarifications of the Church's doctrine and teachings, including scripture, the Biblical canon, sacred tradition, original sin, justification, salvation, the sacraments, the Mass and the veneration of saints. 

Chloroplast<====>6355<====>Chloroplast Chloroplastsare organelles, specialized compartments, in plant and algal cells.  Their discovery inside plant cells is usually credited to Julius von Sachs (1832–1897), an influential botanist and author of standard botanical textbooks – sometimes called "The Father of Plant Physiology". The main role of chloroplasts is to conduct photosynthesis, where the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll captures the energy from sunlight and converts it and stores it in the energy-storage molecules ATP and NADPH while freeing oxygen from water.  They then use the ATP and NADPH to make organic molecules from carbon dioxide in a process known as the Calvin cycle. 

Camp David<====>6357<====>Camp David   Camp David is the country retreat for the President of the United States.  It is located in the wooded hills of Catoctin Mountain Park near Thurmont, Maryland, also near Emmitsburg, Maryland about 62 miles (100 km) north-northwest of Washington, D. C.

Crux<====>6359<====>Crux   Crux   is a constellation located in the southern sky in a bright portion of the Milky Way.  It is among the most easily distinguished constellations, as all of its four main stars have an apparent visual magnitude above +2. 8, even though it is the smallest of all 88 modern constellations.  Its name is Latin for cross, and it is dominated by a cross-shaped or kite-like asterism that is commonly known as the Southern Cross.  Predominating is the first-magnitude blue-white star of Alpha Crucis or Acrux, being the constellation's brightest and most southerly member. 

Cetus<====>6362<====>Cetus   Cetus ( ) is a constellation.  Its name refers to Cetus, a sea monster in Greek mythology, although it is often called 'the whale' today.  Cetus is located in the region of the sky that contains other water-related constellations such as Aquarius, Pisces, and Eridanus. FeaturesEclipticAlthough Cetus is not generally considered part of the zodiac, the ecliptic passes less than a quarter of a degree from its constellation boundary, and thus the moon, planets, and even part of the sun may be in Cetus for brief periods of time.   This is all the more true of asteroids, since their orbits usually have a greater inclination to the ecliptic than the moon and planets. 

Carina (constellation)<====>6363<====>Carina (constellation) Carina   is a constellation in the southern sky.  Its name is Latin for the keel of a ship, and it was formerly part of the larger constellation of Argo Navis (the ship Argo) until that constellation was divided into three pieces, the other two being Puppis (the poop deck), and Vela (the sails of the ship). History and mythologyCarina was once a part of Argo Navis, the great ship of Jason and the Argonauts who searched for the Golden Fleece.  The constellation of Argo was introduced in ancient Greece.  However, due to the massive size of Argo Navis and the sheer number of stars that required separate designation, Nicolas Louis de Lacaille divided Argo into three sections in 1763, including Carina (the keel). 

Camelopardalis<====>6364<====>Camelopardalis  Camelopardalis   or the Giraffe constellation is a large, faint grouping of stars in the northern sky.  The constellation was introduced in 1612 (or 1613) by Petrus Plancius.  Some older astronomy books give an alternative spelling of the name, Camelopardalus, Camelopardi as well as Camelopardus.  EtymologyFirst attested in English in 1785, the word camelopardalis comes from Latin,  and it is the romanization of the Greek "καμηλοπάρδαλις" meaning "giraffe",  from "κάμηλος" (kamēlos), "camel"  + "πάρδαλις" (pardalis), "leopard",  due to its having a long neck like a camel and spots like a leopard. 

Convention of Kanagawa<====>6365<====>Convention of Kanagawa On March 31, 1854, the   or   was the first treaty between the United States of America and the Tokugawa Shogunate. Signed under threat of force, it effectively meant the end of Japan’s 220-year-old policy of national seclusion (sakoku), by opening the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate to American vessels.   It also ensured the safety of American castaways and established the position of an American consul in Japan.  The treaty also precipitated the signing of similar treaties establishing diplomatic relations with other Western powers. The isolation of JapanSince the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Tokugawa shogunate pursued a policy of isolating the country from outside influences. 

Canis Major<====>6366<====>Canis Major   Canis Major   is a constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere.  In the second century, it was included in Ptolemy's 48 constellations, and is counted among the 88 modern constellations.  Its name is Latin for "greater dog" in contrast to Canis Minor, the "lesser dog"; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of Orion the hunter through the sky.  The Milky Way passes through Canis Major and several open clusters lie within its borders, most notably M41. Canis Major contains Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, known as the "dog star". 

Canis Minor<====>6367<====>Canis Minor    Canis Minor   is a small constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere.  In the second century, it was included as an asterism, or pattern, of two stars in Ptolemy's 48 constellations, and it is counted among the 88 modern constellations.  Its name is Latin for "lesser dog", in contrast to Canis Major, the "greater dog"; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of Orion the hunter. Canis Minor contains only two stars brighter than the fourth magnitude, Procyon (Alpha Canis Minoris), with a magnitude of 0. 34, and Gomeisa (Beta Canis Minoris), with a magnitude of 2. 

Centaurus<====>6371<====>Centaurus  Centaurus   is a bright constellation in the southern sky.  One of the largest constellations, Centaurus was included among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.  In Greek mythology, Centaurus represents a centaur; a creature that is half human, half horse (another constellation named after a centaur is one from the zodiac: Sagittarius).  Notable stars include Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to the Solar System, its neighbour in the sky Beta Centauri, and V766 Centauri, one of the largest stars yet discovered. 

Impact crater<====>6416<====>Impact crater {| cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 style="background-color: white;"|-| rowspan=2 |  || |-| rowspan=2 | |-| |} Impact craters in the Solar System:Top-left: 500-kilometer large crater Engelier on Saturn's moon IapetusTop-right: Recently formed impact crater on Mars showing a pristine ray system of ejecta Bottom-left: 50,000-year-old Meteor Crater east of Flagstaff, Arizona, U. S. Bottom-right: The prominent crater Tycho in the southern highlands of the Moon An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body.  In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse,  impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. 

Corona Borealis<====>6420<====>Corona Borealis   Corona Borealis is a small constellation in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere.  It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations.  Its brightest stars form a semicircular arc.  Its Latin name, inspired by its shape, means "northern crown".   In classical mythology Corona Borealis generally represented the crown given by the god Dionysus to the Cretan princess Ariadne and set by him in the heavens.  Other cultures likened the pattern to a circle of elders, an eagle's nest, a bear's den, or even a smokehole. 

Cygnus (constellation)<====>6421<====>Cygnus (constellation)  Cygnus   is a northern constellation lying on the plane of the Milky Way, deriving its name from the Latinized Greek word for swan.  The swan is one of the most recognizable constellations of the northern summer and autumn, and it features a prominent asterism known as the Northern Cross (in contrast to the Southern Cross).  Cygnus was among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Cygnus contains Deneb, one of the brightest stars in the night sky and one corner of the Summer Triangle, as well as some notable X-ray sources and the giant stellar association of Cygnus OB2. 

Calorie<====>6423<====>Calorie A calorie is a unit of energy.  Various definitions exist but fall into two broad categories.  The first, the small calorie, or gram calorie (symbol: cal), is defined as the approximate amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius at a pressure of one atmosphere.   The second is the large calorie or kilogram calorie (symbol: Cal), also known as the food calorie and similar names,  is defined in terms of the kilogram rather than the gram.  It is equal to   small calories or 1 kilocalorie (symbol: kcal). 

Corona Australis<====>6424<====>Corona Australis Corona Australis is a constellation in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere.  Its Latin name means "southern crown", and it is the southern counterpart of Corona Borealis, the northern crown.  It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.  The Ancient Greeks saw Corona Australis as a wreath rather than a crown and associated it with Sagittarius or Centaurus.  Other cultures have likened the pattern to a turtle, ostrich nest, a tent, or even a hut belonging to a rock hyrax. Although fainter than its northern counterpart, the oval- or horseshoe-shaped pattern of its brighter stars renders it distinctive. 

Corcovado<====>6426<====>Corcovado   Corcovado ( ), meaning "hunchback" in Portuguese,  is a mountain in central Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  The 710-metre (2,329 ft) granite peak is located in the Tijuca Forest, a national park.  It is sometimes confused with nearby Sugarloaf Mountain. Corcovado hill lies just west of the city center but is wholly within the city limits and visible from great distances.  It is known worldwide for the 38-metre (125 ft) statue of Jesus atop its peak, entitled Cristo Redentor or "Christ the Redeemer". AccessThe peak and statue can be accessed via a narrow road, by the 3. 

Cheddar, Somerset<====>6427<====>Cheddar, Somerset    Cheddar is a large village and civil parish in the Sedgemoor district of the English county of Somerset.  It is situated on the southern edge of the Mendip Hills,   north-west of Wells.  The civil parish includes the hamlets of Nyland and Bradley Cross.  The village, which has its own parish council, has a population of 5,755 and the parish has an acreage of   as of 1961.  Cheddar Gorge, on the northern edge of the village, is the largest gorge in the United Kingdom and includes several show caves, including Gough's Cave. 

Compact disc<====>6429<====>Compact disc    Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format that was co-developed by Philips and Sony and released in 1982.  The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM).  Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD.  The first commercially available Audio CD player, the Sony CDP-101, was released October 1982 in Japan. 

Charles Farrar Browne<====>6431<====>Charles Farrar Browne See also Artemas Ward (disambiguation).  Charles Farrar Browne (April 26, 1834 – March 6, 1867) was an American humor writer, better known under his nom de plume, Artemus Ward.  He is considered to be America's first stand-up comedian.   His birth name was Brown but he added the "e" after he became famous.    BiographyBrowne was born in Waterford, Maine.  He began his career as a compositor  and occasional contributor to the daily and weekly journals.  In 1858, he published in The Plain Dealer (Cleveland, Ohio) the first of the "Artemus Ward" series, which, in a collected form, achieved great popularity in both America and England. 

Caelum<====>6432<====>Caelum  Caelum   is a faint constellation in the southern sky, introduced in the 1750s by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille and counted among the 88 modern constellations.  Its name means “chisel” in Latin, and it was formerly known as Caelum Scalptorium (“the engravers’ chisel”); It is a rare word, unrelated to the far more common Latin caelum, meaning “sky, heaven, atmosphere”.   It is the eighth-smallest constellation, and subtends a solid angle of around 0. 038 steradians, just less than that of Corona Australis. Due to its small size and location away from the plane of the Milky Way, Caelum is a rather barren constellation, with few objects of interest. 

Clarinet<====>6433<====>Clarinet  The clarinet is a musical-instrument family belonging to the group known as the woodwind instruments.  It has a single-reed mouthpiece, a straight cylindrical tube with an almost cylindrical bore, and a flared bell.  A person who plays a clarinet is called a clarinetist (sometimes spelled clarinettist). While the similarity in sound between the earliest clarinets and the trumpet may hold a clue to its name,  other factors may have been involved.  During the Late Baroque era, composers such as Bach and Handel were making new demands on the skills of their trumpeters, who were often required to play difficult melodic passages in the high, or as it came to be called, clarion register. 

Chojnów<====>6434<====>Chojnów    Chojnów   ( ) is a small town in Legnica County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland.  It is located on the Skora river, a tributary of the Kaczawa at an average altitude of   above sea level.  Chojnów is the administrative seat of the rural gmina called Gmina Chojnów, although the town is not part of its territory and forms a separate urban gmina.    it had 14,389 inhabitants. Chojnów is located   west of Legnica,   east from Bolesławiec and   north of Złotoryja,   from the A4 motorway. 

Canes Venatici<====>6435<====>Canes Venatici Canes Venatici   is one of the 88 official modern constellations.   It is a small northern constellation that was created by Johannes Hevelius in the 17th century.  Its name is Latin for "hunting dogs", and the constellation is often depicted in illustrations as representing the dogs of Boötes the Herdsman, a neighboring constellation.  Cor Caroli is the constellation's brightest star, with an apparent magnitude of 2. 9.  La Superba is one  of the reddest stars in the sky and one of the brightest carbon stars.  The Whirlpool Galaxy is a spiral galaxy tilted face-on to observers on Earth, and was the first galaxy whose spiral nature was discerned. 

Chamaeleon<====>6436<====>Chamaeleon  Chamaeleon ( ) is a small constellation in the southern sky.  It is named after the chameleon, a kind of lizard.  It was first defined in the 16th century. HistoryChamaeleon was one of twelve constellations created by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman.   It first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius.   Johann Bayer was the first uranographer to put Chamaeleon in a celestial atlas.  It was one of many constellations created by European explorers in the 15th and 16th centuries out of unfamiliar Southern Hemisphere stars. 

Cholesterol<====>6437<====>Cholesterol  Cholesterol, from the Ancient Greek chole- (bile) and stereos (solid) followed by the chemical suffix -ol for an alcohol, is an organic molecule.  It is a sterol (or modified steroid),  a type of lipid molecule, and is biosynthesized by all animal cells, because it is an essential structural component of all animal cell membranes and is essential to maintain both membrane structural integrity and fluidity.  Cholesterol allows animal cells to function without a cell wall (which in other species protects membrane integrity and cell viability); this allows animal cells to change shape rapidly. In addition to its importance for animal cell structure, cholesterol also serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, bile acid,    and vitamin D. 

Chromosome<====>6438<====>Chromosome A chromosome (from ancient Greek: χρωμόσωμα, chromosoma, chroma means color, soma means body) is a DNA molecule with part or all of the genetic material (genome) of an organism.  Most eukaryotic chromosomes include packaging proteins which, aided by chaperone proteins, bind to and condense the DNA molecule to prevent the DNA from becoming an unmanageable tangle.Chromosomes are normally visible under a light microscope only when the cell is undergoing the metaphase of cell division.  Before this happens, every chromosome is copied once (S phase), and the copy is joined to the original by a centromere, resulting either in an X-shaped structure (pictured to the right) if the centromere is located in the middle of the chromosome or a two-arm structure if the centromere is located near one of the ends. 

Colonna family<====>6440<====>Colonna family   The Colonna family, also known as Sciarrillo or Sciarra, is an Italian noble family.  It was powerful in medieval and Renaissance Rome, supplying one Pope and many other Church and political leaders.  The family is notable for its bitter feud with the Orsini family over influence in Rome, until it was stopped by Papal Bull in 1511.  In 1571, the heads of both families married nieces of Pope Sixtus V.  Thereafter, historians recorded that "no peace had been concluded between the princes of Christendom, in which they had not been included by name". 

Ceuta<====>6443<====>Ceuta   Ceuta (assimilated pronunciation    ; also    ;   ;  , Sabtah) is an   Spanish autonomous city on the north coast of Africa, separated by 14 kilometres from Cadiz province on the Spanish mainland by the Strait of Gibraltar and sharing a 6. 4 kilometre land border with M'diq-Fnideq Prefecture in the Kingdom of Morocco.  It lies along the boundary between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean and is one of nine populated Spanish territories in Africa and, along with Melilla, one of two populated territories on mainland Africa. 

Carcinogen<====>6445<====>CarcinogenA carcinogen is any substance, radionuclide, or radiation that promotes carcinogenesis, the formation of cancer.  This may be due to the ability to damage the genome or to the disruption of cellular metabolic processes.  Several radioactive substances are considered carcinogens, but their carcinogenic activity is attributed to the radiation, for example gamma rays and alpha particles, which they emit.  Common examples of non-radioactive carcinogens are inhaled asbestos, certain dioxins, and tobacco smoke.   Although the public generally associates carcinogenicity with synthetic chemicals, it is equally likely to arise in both natural and synthetic substances.   Carcinogens are not necessarily immediately toxic; thus, their effect can be insidious. 

Camouflage<====>6446<====>Camouflage  Camouflage is the use of any combination of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects hard to see (crypsis), or by disguising them as something else (mimesis).  Examples include the leopard's spotted coat, the battledress of a modern soldier, and the leaf-mimic katydid's wings.  A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate.  The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast disruptive coloration, eliminating shadow, and countershading.  In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the ability to produce light is among other things used for counter-illumination on the undersides of cephalopods such as squid. 

Clock<====>6449<====>Clock   A clock is an instrument to measure, keep, and indicate time.  The word clock is derived (via Dutch, Northern French, and Medieval Latin) from the Celtic words clagan and clocca meaning "bell".  A silent instrument missing such a striking mechanism has traditionally been known as a timepiece.   In general usage today, a "clock" refers to any device for measuring and displaying the time.  Watches and other timepieces that can be carried on one's person are often distinguished from clocks.  The clock is one of the oldest human inventions, meeting the need to measure intervals of time shorter than the natural units: the day, the lunar month, and the year. 

Charles Proteus Steinmetz<====>6451<====>Charles Proteus Steinmetz Charles Proteus Steinmetz (born Karl August Rudolph Steinmetz, April 9, 1865 – October 26, 1923) was a German-born American mathematician and electrical engineer and professor at Union College.  He fostered the development of alternating current that made possible the expansion of the electric power industry in the United States, formulating mathematical theories for engineers.  He made ground-breaking discoveries in the understanding of hysteresis that enabled engineers to design better electromagnetic apparatus equipment including especially electric motors for use in industry. Early lifeSteinmetz was born Karl August Rudolph Steinmetz on April 9, 1865 in Breslau, Province of Silesia, Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland) the son of Caroline (Neubert) and Karl Heinrich Steinmetz. 

Charles Martel<====>6452<====>Charles Martel   Charles Martel (c.  686 – 22 October 741) was a Frankish statesman and military leader who as Duke and Prince of the Franks and Mayor of the Palace, was de facto ruler of Francia from 718 until his death.The son of the Frankish statesman Pepin of Herstal and a noblewoman named Alpaida, Charles successfully asserted his claims to power as successor to his father as the power behind the throne in Frankish politics.  Continuing and building on his father's work, he restored centralized government in Francia and began the series of military campaigns that re-established the Franks as the undisputed masters of all Gaul. 

Charles Edward Jones<====>6456<====>Charles Edward Jones Colonel Charles Edward ("Chuck") Jones (November 8, 1952 – September 11, 2001) was a United States Air Force officer, a computer programmer, and an astronaut in the USAF Manned Spaceflight Engineer Program. BiographyJones was born November 8, 1952, in Clinton, Indiana.   He graduated from Wichita East High School in 1970, earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Astronautical Engineering from the United States Air Force Academy in 1974, and received a Master of Science degree in Astronautics from MIT in 1980.  He entered the USAF Manned Spaceflight Engineer program in 1982, and was scheduled to fly on mission STS-71-B in December 1986, but the mission was cancelled after the Challenger Disaster in January 1986. 

Ceramic<====>6458<====>Ceramic A ceramic is an inorganic compound, non-metallic, solid material comprising metal, non-metal or metalloid atoms primarily held in ionic and covalent bonds.  This article gives an overview of ceramic materials from the point of view of materials science. The crystallinity of ceramic materials ranges from highly oriented to semi-crystalline, vitrified, and often completely amorphous (e. g. , glasses).  Most often, fired ceramics are either vitrified or semi-vitrified as is the case with earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain.  Varying crystallinity and electron consumption in the ionic and covalent bonds cause most ceramic materials to be good thermal and electrical insulators (extensively researched in ceramic engineering). 

Wu Xing<====>6459<====>Wu Xing    The Wu Xing ( ), also known as the Five Elements, Five Phases, the Five Agents, the Five Movements, Five Processes, the Five Steps/Stages and the Five Planets of significant gravity: Jupiter-木, Saturn-土, Mercury-水, Venus-金, Mars-火 Dr Zai, J.  Taoism and Science: Cosmology, Evolution, Morality, Health and more.  Ultravisum, 2015.   is the short form of "Wǔ zhǒng liúxíng zhī qì" (五種流行之氣) or "the five types of chi dominating at different times".   It is a fivefold conceptual scheme that many traditional Chinese fields used to explain a wide array of phenomena, from cosmic cycles to the interaction between internal organs, and from the succession of political regimes to the properties of medicinal drugs. 

Church of Christ, Scientist<====>6462<====>Church of Christ, Scientist  The Church of Christ, Scientist was founded in 1879 in Boston, Massachusetts, by Mary Baker Eddy, author of Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, and founder of Christian Science.  The church was founded "to commemorate the word and works of [Christ Jesus]" and "reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing".  Sunday services are held throughout the year and weekly testimony meetings are held on Wednesday evenings, where following brief readings from the Bible and the Christian Science textbook, those in attendance are invited to give testimonies of healing brought about through Christian Science prayer. 

Connecticut<====>6466<====>Connecticut    {{Infobox U. S.  state symbols }}Connecticut ( )  is the southernmost state in the New England region of the northeastern United States.  As of the 2010 Census, Connecticut features the highest per-capita income, Human Development Index (0. 962), and median household income in the United States.Connecticut is bordered by Rhode Island to the east, Massachusetts to the north, New York to the west, and Long Island Sound to the south.  Its capital is Hartford and its most populous city is Bridgeport.  Although Connecticut is technically part of New England, it is often grouped along with New York and New Jersey as the Tri-state area. 

Country Liberal Party<====>6468<====>Country Liberal Party   The Country Liberal Party (CLP), officially the Country Liberals (Northern Territory),   is a conservative    political party in Australia founded in 1974, which operates solely in the Northern Territory.    The CLP first fielded candidates at the 1975 federal election, winning one seat in the Senate and the non-voting seat in the House of Representatives.  Since 1979, the CLP has been formally affiliated with both the federal Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia (previously the Country Party and National Country Party).  The Liberal Party, National Party, Liberal National Party of Queensland, and CLP form the Coalition of Australian centre-right parties,    with the CLP alone contesting seats for the Coalition in the Northern Territory. 

Canon law<====>6469<====>Canon law Canon law is a set of ordinances and regulations made by ecclesiastical authority (Church leadership), for the government of a Christian organization or church and its members.  It is the internal ecclesiastical law, or operational policy, governing the Roman Catholic Church (both the Latin Church and the  Eastern Catholic Churches), the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches, and the individual national churches within the Anglican Communion.   Canon law wasn't just a body of rules and regulations governing members of the church, but rather an elaborate code of ethics shaping family life and marriage.  Due to this, it was able to manipulate the fundamental operations of family life within the areas that it oversaw. 

Columbanus<====>6501<====>Columbanus    Columbanus ( , 543 – 21 November 615),  also known as St.  Columban,    was an Irish missionary notable for founding a number of monasteries from around 590 in the Frankish and Lombard kingdoms, most notably Luxeuil Abbey in present-day France and Bobbio Abbey in present-day Italy.  He is remembered as a key figure in the Hiberno-Scottish mission, or Irish missionary activity in early medieval Europe.In recent years, however, as Columbanus's deeds and legacy have come to be re-examined by historians, the traditional narrative of his career has been challenged and doubts have been raised regarding his actual involvement in missionary work and the extent to which he was driven by purely religious motives or also by a concern for playing an active part in politics and church politics in Francia. 

Concord, New Hampshire<====>6503<====>Concord, New Hampshire  Concord   is the capital city of the U. S.  state of New Hampshire and the county seat of Merrimack County.  As of the 2010 census, its population was 42,695.  Concord includes the villages of Penacook, East Concord, and West Concord.  The city is home to the University of New Hampshire School of Law, New Hampshire's only law school; St.  Paul's School, a private preparatory school; NHTI, a two-year community college; and the Granite State Symphony Orchestra. HistoryThe area that would become Concord was originally settled thousands of years ago by Abenaki Native Americans called the Pennacook. 

Chlorophyceae<====>6505<====>Chlorophyceae The Chlorophyceae are one of the classes of green algae, distinguished mainly on the basis of ultrastructural morphology.   For example, the chlorophycean CW clade, and chlorophycean DO clade, are defined by the arrangement of their flagella.  Members of the CW clade have flagella that are displaced in a "clockwise" (CW, 1–7 o'clock) direction e. g.  Chlamydomonadales.   Members of the DO clade have flagella that are "directly opposed" (DO, 12–6 o'clock) e. g.  Sphaeropleales.  They are usually green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b.  The chloroplast may be  , plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon shaped in different species. 

Cyril<====>6508<====>Cyril  Cyril (also Cyrillus or Cyryl) is a masculine given name. It is derived from the Greek name Κύριλλος (Kýrillos) meaning "Lordly, Masterful", which in turn derives from Greek κυριος (kýrios) "lord". There are various variant forms of the Cyril name such as Cyrill, Cyrille, Kirill, Kiryl, Kirillos, Kyrylo, Kiril, Kiro and Kyrill.It may also refer to:Christian patriarchs or bishopsSaint Cyril of Jerusalem (c. 313 – 386), theologian and bishopSaint Cyril of Alexandria (c. 376 – 444), Patriarch of AlexandriaSaint Cyril the Philosopher (link to Saints Cyril and Methodius), 9th century Greek missionary, co-invented the Slavic alphabet, translated the Bible into Old Church SlavonicPope Cyril II of Alexandria reigned 1078–1092Greek Patriarch Cyril II of Alexandria reigned in the 12th centurySaint Cyril of Turaw (1130–1182), Belorussian bishop and orthodox saintPope Cyril III of Alexandria reigned 1235–1243Cyril, Metropolitan of Moscow died 1572Cyril Lucaris (Patriarch Cyril I of Constantinople), reigned for six terms between 1612 and 1638Patriarch Cyril II of Constantinople, patriarch in 1633, 1635–1636, 1638–1639Patriarch Cyril III of Constantinople, patriarch in 1652 and 1654Patriarch Cyril IV of Constantinople, patriarch 1711–1713Cyril V Zaim, Melkite patriarch of Antioch died 1720Cyril VI Tanas, Melkite patriarch of Antioch 1724–1760Patriarch Cyril V of Constantinople, patriarch in 1748–1751, 1752–1757Cyril VII Siaj, Melkite patriarch of Antioch 1794–1796Patriarch Cyril VI of Constantinople, patriarch in 1813–1818Patriarch Cyril II of Jerusalem, reigned 1845–1875Patriarch Cyril VII of Constantinople, patriarch in 1855–1860Pope Cyril IV of Alexandria reigned 1854–1861Pope Cyril V of Alexandria reigned 1874–1921Cyril VIII Jaha, Melkite patriarch of Antioch 1902–1916Cyril IX Moghabghab, Melkite patriarch of Antioch 1925–1946Patriarch Cyril of Bulgaria, reigned 1953–1971Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria, reigned 1959–1971Other individualsCyrillus, 5th century Greek juristCyril Almeida, Pakistani journalistCyril Bourlon de Rouvre (1945-), French businessman and politicianSir Cyril Burt (1883-1971), century psychologistCyril Delevanti (1889–1975), British actorCyril Despres (b 1974) French motorcycle riderCyril De Zoysa, Sri Lankan businessman and Buddhist revivalistCyril Domoraud, (b. 1971), Ivorian football player (senior career 1992–2008) who played for the Côte d'Ivoire national team (1995–2006)Cyril Gautier (1987-), French racing cyclistCyril Stanley Harrison, (1915-1998) English cricketerCyril Leo Heraclius, Prince Toumanoff (born Toumanishvili) (1913–1997), Russian-born historian and genealogist who was a Professor Emeritus at Georgetown UniversityCyril Lewis, Welsh footballerSister M.

Computational complexity<====>6511<====>Computational complexity In computer science, the computational complexity, or simply complexity of an algorithm is the amount of resources required for running it.  The computational complexity of a problem is the minimum of the complexities of all possible algorithms for this problem (including the unknown algorithms).  As the amount of needed resources varies with the input, the complexity is generally expressed as a function  , where   is the size of the input, and   is either the worst-case complexity, that is the maximum of the amount of resources that are needed for all input of size  , or the average-case complexity, that is average of the amount of resources over all input of size  . 

Coercion<====>6512<====>Coercion   Coercion   is the practice of forcing another party to act in an involuntary manner by use of threats or force.   It involves a set of various types of forceful actions that violate the free will of an individual to induce a desired response, for example: a bully demanding lunch money from a student or the student gets beaten.  These actions may include, but are not limited to: extortion, blackmail, torture, threats to induce favors, or even sexual assault.  In law, coercion is codified as a duress crime.  Such actions are used as leverage, to force the victim to act in a way contrary to their own interests. 

Client–server model<====>6513<====>Client–server model The client–server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.   Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system.  A server host  runs one or more server programs which share their resources with clients.  A client does not share any of its resources, but requests a server's content or service function.  Clients therefore initiate communication sessions with servers which await incoming requests. 

County Dublin<====>6514<====>County Dublin   County Dublin (   or Contae Átha Cliath) is a county in Ireland.  Since the abolition of Dublin County Council in 1994, for local government it has been divided into four administrative areas: Dublin city, Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin (as numbered 1 to 4 in the figure below).  The population of the entire county was 1,345,402 according to the census of 2016.  Population and Actual and Percentage Change 2011 to 2016 by Sex, Province County or City, CensusYear and Statistic, Central Statistics Office.

Cosmological argument<====>6516<====>Cosmological argument In natural theology and philosophy, a cosmological argument is an argument in which the existence of a unique being, generally seen as some kind of god or demiurge is deduced or inferred from facts or alleged facts concerning causation, change, motion, contingency, or finitude in respect of the universe as a whole or processes within it.   It is traditionally known as an argument from universal causation, an argument from first cause, or the causal argument, and is more precisely a cosmogonical argument (about the origin).  Whichever term is employed, there are three basic variants of the argument, each with subtle yet important distinctions: the arguments from in causa (causality), in esse (essentiality), and in fieri (becoming). 

Clutch<====>6517<====>Clutch   A clutch is a mechanical device which engages and disengages power transmission especially from driving shaft to driven shaft. In the simplest application, clutches connect and disconnect two rotating shafts (drive shafts or line shafts).  In these devices, one shaft is typically attached to an engine or other power unit (the driving member) while the other shaft (the driven member) provides output power for work.  While typically the motions involved are rotary, linear clutches are also possible. In a torque-controlled drill, for instance, one shaft is driven by a motor and the other drives a drill chuck. 

Cow tipping<====>6520<====>Cow tipping  Cow tipping is the purported activity of sneaking up on any unsuspecting or sleeping upright cow and pushing it over for entertainment.  The practice of cow tipping is generally considered an urban legend,  and stories of such feats viewed as tall tales.   The implication that rural citizens seek such entertainment due to lack of other alternatives is viewed as a stereotype.The concept of cow tipping apparently developed in the 1970s, though tales of animals that cannot rise if they fall has historical antecedents dating to the Roman Empire. 

Cassandra<====>6526<====>Cassandra Cassandra or Kassandra (Ancient Greek: Κασσάνδρα,  , also  ), also known as Alexandra, was a daughter of King Priam and of Queen Hecuba of Troy in Greek mythology. Cassandra was cursed to speak true prophecies that no one believed.  A common version of her story relates how, in an effort to seduce her, Apollo gave her the power of prophecy: when she refused him, he spat into her mouth to inflict a curse that nobody would ever believe her prophecies.  Another version has her fall asleep in a temple, where snakes licked (or whispered in) her ears so that she could hear the future. 

Couplet<====>6530<====>Couplet  A couplet is a pair of successive lines of metre in poetry.   A couplet usually consists of two successive lines that rhyme and have the same metre.  A couplet may be formal (closed) or run-on (open).   In a formal (or closed) couplet, each of the two lines is end-stopped, implying that there is a grammatical pause at the end of a line of verse.   In a run-on (or open) couplet, the meaning of the first line continues to the second.  BackgroundThe word "couplet" comes from the French word meaning "two pieces of iron riveted or hinged together.

Early life and educationWilliams was born in London in 1886, the only son of (Richard) Walter Stansby Williams (1848–1929), a journalist and foreign business correspondent for an importing firm, writing in French and German,   who was a 'regular and valued' contributor of verse, stories and articles to many popular magazines,    and his wife Mary (née Wall, the sister of the ecclesiologist and historian J. 

Celery<====>6535<====>Celery  Celery (Apium graveolens) is a marshland plant in the family Apiaceae that has been cultivated as a vegetable since antiquity.  Celery has a long fibrous stalk tapering into leaves.  Depending on location and cultivar, either its stalks, leaves, or hypocotyl are eaten and used in cooking.   Celery seed is also used as a spice and its extracts have been used in herbal medicine. DescriptionCelery leaves are pinnate to bipinnate with rhombic leaflets   long and   broad.  The flowers are creamy-white,   in diameter, and are produced in dense compound umbels. 

Celestines<====>6537<====>Celestines The Celestines were a Roman Catholic monastic order, a branch of the Benedictines, founded in 1244.   At the foundation of the new rule, they were called Hermits of St Damiano, or Moronites (or Murronites), and did not assume the appellation of Celestines until after the election of their founder, Peter of Morone (Pietro Murrone), to the Papacy as Celestine V.   They used the post-nominal initials O. S. B.  Cel.  Founding The fame of the holy life and the austerities practised by Pietro Morone in his solitude on the Mountain of Majella, near Sulmona, attracted many visitors, several of whom were moved to remain and share his mode of life. 

Cessna<====>6539<====>Cessna  The Cessna Aircraft Company is an American general aviation aircraft manufacturing corporation headquartered in Wichita, Kansas.  Best known for small, piston-powered aircraft, Cessna also produces business jets.  For many years the company has been one of the highest-volume producers of general aviation aircraft in the world.  It is a subsidiary of the U. S.  conglomerate Textron. In March 2014 Cessna became a brand of Textron Aviation.    HistoryClyde Cessna, a farmer in Rago, Kansas, built his own aircraft and flew it in June 1911, the first person to do so between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. 

Czesław Miłosz<====>6542<====>Czesław Miłosz Czesław Miłosz ( ; 30 June 1911 – 14 August 2004) was a Polish  poet, prose writer, translator and diplomat.  His World War II-era sequence The World is a collection of twenty "naïve" poems.  Following the war, he served as Polish cultural attaché in Paris and Washington, D. C. , then in 1951 defected to the West.   His nonfiction book The Captive Mind (1953) became a classic of anti-Stalinism.  From 1961 to 1998 he was a professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures at the University of California, Berkeley. 

Carnivore<====>6543<====>Carnivore A carnivore  , meaning "meat eater" (Latin, caro, genitive carnis, meaning "meat" or "flesh" and vorare meaning "to devour"), is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging.   Mammals: Carnivores.  Duane E.  Ullrey.  Encyclopedia of Animal Science.   Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called   carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called   carnivores.   Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and, apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. 

Celts<====>6546<====>Celts    The Celts ( , see pronunciation of Celt for different usages) were an Indo-European people in Iron Age and Medieval Europe who spoke Celtic languages and had cultural similarities,    although the relationship between ethnic, linguistic and cultural factors in the Celtic world remains uncertain and controversial.The exact geographic spread of the ancient Celts is also disputed; in particular, the ways in which the Iron Age inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland should be regarded as Celts has become a subject of controversy.    The history of pre-Celtic Europe remains very uncertain. 

Claude Monet<====>6548<====>Claude MonetOscar-Claude Monet ( ;  ; 14 November 1840 – 5 December 1926) was a founder of French Impressionist painting, and the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy of expressing one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied to plein-air landscape painting. The term "Impressionism" is derived from the title of his painting Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the Salon de Paris.  Monet's ambition of documenting the French countryside led him to adopt a method of painting the same scene many times in order to capture the changing of light and the passing of the seasons. 

Conectiva<====>6552<====>Conectiva Conectiva was a company founded on August 28, 1995, in Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil, by a group of friends, among them Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo, who was a pioneer in the distribution of Linux and open source software in Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish and English for all of Latin America .  Besides a customized Linux distribution for the Latin American market, Conectiva developed a series of products and additional services directed to meet the market demand for open source tools, including books, manuals, additional software like Linux Tools and embedded systems, OEM programs, applications port, training kits and the "Revista do Linux" Linux magazine. 

Carthage<====>6555<====>Carthage   Carthage ( , from  ;   ("New city") was the centre or capital city of the ancient Carthaginian civilization, on the eastern side of the Lake of Tunis  in what is now the Tunis Governorate in Tunisia. The city developed from a Phoenician colony into the capital of an empire dominating the Mediterranean during the first millennium BC.   The legendary Queen Dido is regarded as the founder of the city, though her historicity has been questioned.  According to accounts by Timaeus of Tauromenium, she purchased from a local tribe the amount of land that could be covered by an oxhide. 

Coprime integers<====>6556<====>Coprime integers In number theory, two integers   and   are said to be relatively prime, mutually prime,  or coprime (also written co-prime) if the only positive integer (factor) that divides both of them is 1.  Consequently, any prime number that divides one does not divide the other.  This is equivalent to their greatest common divisor being 1.   The numerator and denominator of a reduced fraction are coprime.  As specific examples, 14 and 15 are coprime, being commonly divisible only by 1, while 14 and 21 are not coprime, because they are both divisible by 7. 

Control unit<====>6557<====>Control unit The control unit (CU) is a component of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) that directs the operation of the processor.  It tells the computer's memory, arithmetic/logic unit and input and output devices how to respond to a program's instructions.  It directs the operation of the other units by providing timing and control signals. Most computer resources are managed by the CU.  It directs the flow of data between the CPU and the other devices.  John von Neumann included the control unit as part of the von Neumann architecture.   In modern computer designs, the control unit is typically an internal part of the CPU  with its overall role and operation unchanged since its introduction. 

Cello<====>6558<====>Cello  The cello (   ; plural cellos or celli) or violoncello (   ;   ) is a bowed, and sometimes plucked, string instrument with four strings tuned in perfect fifths.  The strings from low to high are generally tuned to C 2 , G 2 , D 3  and A 3 , an octave lower than the viola.  It is the bass member of the violin family of musical instruments, which also includes the violin, viola and the double bass.  The cello is used as a solo musical instrument, as well as in chamber music ensembles (e. 

Control store<====>6559<====>Control storeA control store is the part of a CPU's control unit that stores the CPU's microprogram.   It is usually accessed by a microsequencer.  Early types of control store took the form of diode-arrays that were accessed via address decoders, but were later implemented as writable microcode that was stored in a form of read-only memory called a writable control store.  The outputs generally had to go through a register to prevent a race condition from occurring.  The register was clocked by the clock signal of the system it was running on. ImplementationEarly useEarly control stores were implemented as a diode-array accessed via address decoders, a form of read-only memory. 

Columba<====>6561<====>Columba    Saint Columba ( , 'church dove';   ;  ;  7 December 521 – 9 June 597) was an Irish abbot and missionary credited with spreading Christianity in what is today Scotland at the start of the Hiberno-Scottish mission.  He founded the important abbey on Iona, which became a dominant religious and political institution in the region for centuries.  He is the Patron Saint of Derry.  He was highly regarded by both the Gaels of Dál Riata and the Picts, and is remembered today as a Christian saint and one of the Twelve Apostles of Ireland. 

Conditional proof<====>6562<====>Conditional proof A conditional proof is a proof that takes the form of asserting a conditional, and proving that the antecedent of the conditional necessarily leads to the consequent.  The assumed antecedent of a conditional proof is called the conditional proof assumption (CPA).   Thus, the goal of a conditional proof is to demonstrate that if the CPA were true, then the desired conclusion necessarily follows.  The validity of a conditional proof does not require that the CPA be actually true, only that if it were true it would lead to the consequent. Conditional proofs are of great importance in mathematics. 

Conjunction introduction<====>6563<====>Conjunction introduction Conjunction introduction (often abbreviated simply as conjunction and also called and introduction   ) is a valid rule of inference of propositional logic.  The rule makes it possible to introduce a conjunction into a logical proof.  It is the inference that if the proposition p is true, and proposition q is true, then the logical conjunction of the two propositions p and q is true.  For example, if it's true that it's raining, and it's true that I'm inside, then it's true that "it's raining and I'm inside".  The rule can be stated: \frac{P,Q}{\therefore P \and Q} where the rule is that wherever an instance of " P " and " Q " appear on lines of a proof, a " P \and Q " can be placed on a subsequent line. 

English in the Commonwealth of Nations<====>6566<====>English in the Commonwealth of Nations The use of the English language in most member countries of the Commonwealth of Nations was inherited from British colonisation.  English is spoken as a first or second language in most of the Commonwealth.  In a few countries, such as Cyprus and Malaysia, it does not have official status, but is widely used as a lingua franca.  Mozambique is an exception – although English is widely spoken there, it is a former Portuguese colony which joined the Commonwealth in 1996. Many regions, notably Canada, Australia, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore and the Caribbean, have developed their own native varieties of the language. 

Charles McCarry<====>6569<====>Charles McCarry Charles McCarry (born in 1930, in Massachusetts, United States) is an American writer, primarily of spy fiction, and a former undercover operative for the Central Intelligence Agency who The Wall Street Journal described in 2013 as the dean of American spy writers;    The New Republic magazine calls him "poet laureate of the CIA. ";  and Otto Penzler says he has produced some "poetic masterpieces. "  William Zinsser calls him a "political novelist:" Jonathan Yardley, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic for the Washington Post, calls him a "'serious' novelist" whose work may include "the best novel ever written about life in high-stakes Washington, DC. 

Cimbri<====>6571<====>Cimbri The Cimbri were a Germanic people who, together with the Teutones and the Ambrones, fought the Roman Republic between 113 and 101 BC.   The Cimbri were initially successful, particularly at the Battle of Arausio, in which a large Roman army was routed, after which they raided large areas in Gaul and Hispania.  In 101 BC, during an attempted invasion of Italy, the Cimbri were decisively defeated by Gaius Marius, and their king, Boiorix, was killed.  Some of the surviving captives are reported to have been among the rebelling gladiators in the Third Servile War.    Roman sources such as Strabo and Tacitus identify these Cimbri with a group living in Jutland, but strong evidence for this connection is lacking. 

Cleveland Browns<====>6576<====>Cleveland Browns   The Cleveland Browns are a professional  American football team based in Cleveland, Ohio.  The Browns compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division.  The Browns play their home games at FirstEnergy Stadium, which opened in 1999,   with administrative offices and training facilities in Berea, Ohio.  The Browns' official colors are brown, orange and white.   They are unique among the 32 member franchises of the NFL in that they do not have a logo on their helmets and are the only team named after a person, their first coach, Paul Brown. 

Carbine<====>6579<====>Carbine   A carbine (  or  ),  from French carabine,  is a long gun firearm but with a shorter barrel than a rifle or musket.   Many carbines are shortened versions of full-length rifles, shooting the same ammunition, while others fire lower-powered ammunition, including types designed for pistols.  The smaller size and lighter weight of carbines make them easier to handle.  They are typically issued to high-mobility troops such as special-operations soldiers and paratroopers, as well as to mounted, artillery, logistics, or other non-infantry personnel whose roles do not require full-sized rifles, although there is a growing tendency for carbines to be issued to front-line soldiers to offset the increasing weight of other issued equipment. 

Chinese cuisine<====>6583<====>Chinese cuisine   Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture, which includes cuisine originating from the diverse regions of China, as well as from Chinese people in other parts of the world.  Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia, with modifications made to cater to local palates. The preference for seasoning and cooking techniques of Chinese provinces depend on differences in historical background and ethnic groups.  Geographic features including mountains, rivers, forests and deserts also have a strong effect on the local available ingredients, considering climate of China varies from tropical in the south to subarctic in the northeast. 

Constantin Brâncuși<====>6585<====>Constantin Brâncuși Constantin Brâncuși ( ; February 19, 1876 – March 16, 1957) was a Romanian sculptor, painter and photographer who made his career in France.  Considered a pioneer of modernism, one of the most influential sculptors of the 20th-century, Brâncuși is called the patriarch of modern sculpture.  As a child he displayed an aptitude for carving wooden farm tools.  Formal studies took him first to Bucharest, then to Munich, then to the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris from 1905 to 1907.  His art emphasizes clean geometrical lines that balance forms inherent in his materials with the symbolic allusions of representational art. 

Claus Sluter<====>6586<====>Claus SluterClaus Sluter (1340s in Haarlem  – 1405 or 1406 in Dijon) was a sculptor of Dutch origin.   He was the most important northern European sculptor of his age and is considered a pioneer of the "northern realism" of the Early Netherlandish painting that came into full flower with the work of Jan van Eyck and others in the next generation. The name "Claes de Slutere van Herlam" is inscribed in the Register of the Corporation of Stonemasons and Sculptors of Brussels around the years 1379/1380.   He then moved to the Burgundian capital of Dijon, where from 1385 to 1389 he was the assistant of Jean de Marville, Court Sculptor to Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy.

Cruise missile<====>6590<====>Cruise missile  A cruise missile is a guided missile used against terrestrial targets that remains in the atmosphere and flies the major portion of its flight path at approximately constant speed.  Cruise missiles are designed to deliver a large warhead over long distances with high precision.  Modern cruise missiles are capable of travelling at supersonic or high subsonic speeds, are self-navigating, and are able to fly on a non-ballistic, extremely low-altitude trajectory. HistoryThe idea of an "aerial torpedo" was shown in the British 1909 film The Airship Destroyer, where flying torpedoes controlled wirelessly are used to bring down airships bombing London. 

Crete<====>6591<====>Crete   Crete ( ,    ; Ancient Greek:  , Krḗtē) is the largest and most populous of the Greek islands, the 88th largest island in the world and the fifth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, after Sicily, Sardinia, Cyprus and Corsica.  Crete and a number of surrounding islands and islets constitute the region of Crete ( ), one of the 13 top-level administrative units of Greece.  The capital and the largest city is Heraklion.   , the region had a population of 623,065. Crete forms a significant part of the economy and cultural heritage of Greece, while retaining its own local cultural traits (such as its own poetry and music). 

Cyclades<====>6592<====>Cyclades   The Cyclades ( ;    ) are an island group in the Aegean Sea, southeast of mainland Greece and a former administrative prefecture of Greece.  They are one of the island groups which constitute the Aegean archipelago.  The name refers to the islands around (κυκλάς) the sacred island of Delos.  The largest island of the Cyclades is Naxos. History The significant Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age Cycladic culture is best known for its schematic, flat idols carved out of the islands' pure white marble centuries before the great Middle Bronze Age Minoan civilization arose in Crete to the south. 

Computer vision<====>6596<====>Computer vision Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made for gaining high-level understanding from digital images or videos.  From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do.    Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e. g. , in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. 

Curry<====>6597<====>Curry   Curry ( , plural curries) is an umbrella term referring to a number of dishes originating in the  cuisine of the Indian subcontinent.  The common feature is the use of complex combinations of spices or herbs, usually including fresh or dried hot chillies.   The use of the term is generally limited to dishes prepared in a sauce.   Curry dishes prepared in the southern states of India may be spiced with leaves from the curry tree.  There are many varieties of dishes called 'curries'.  For example, in original traditional cuisines, the precise selection of spices for each dish is a matter of national or regional cultural tradition, religious practice, and, to some extent, family preference. 

Camel<====>6598<====>Camel   A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus, bearing distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back.  The three surviving species of camel are the dromedary, or one-humped camel (C.  dromedarius), which inhabits the Middle East and the Horn of Africa; the Bactrian, or two-humped camel (C.  bactrianus), which inhabits Central Asia; and the critically endangered wild Bactrian camel (C.  ferus) that has limited populations in remote areas of northwest China and Mongolia.  Bactrian camels take their name from the historical Bactria region of Central Asia.  Additionally one other species of camel    in the separate genus Camelops, C. 

Chaldea<====>6599<====>Chaldea  Chaldea  ( ) or Chaldaea  was a Semitic-speaking nation which existed between the late 10th or early 9th and mid-6th centuries BC, after which it and its people were absorbed and assimilated into Babylonia.   It was located in the marshy land of the far southeastern corner of Mesopotamia and briefly came to rule Babylon. During a period of weakness in the East Semitic speaking kingdom of Babylonia, new tribes of West Semitic-speaking migrants  arrived in the region from the Levant between the 11th and 9th centuries BC.  The earliest waves consisted of Suteans and Arameans, followed a century or so later by the Kaldu, a group who became known later as the Chaldeans or the Chaldees. 

Currying<====>6600<====>Currying In mathematics and computer science, currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments (or a tuple of arguments) into evaluating a sequence of functions, each with a single argument.  Currying is related to, but not the same as, partial application. Currying is useful in both practical and theoretical settings.  In functional programming languages, and many others, it provides a way of automatically managing how arguments are passed to functions and exceptions.  In theoretical computer science, it provides a way to study functions with multiple arguments in simpler theoretical models which provide only one argument. 

Cyrus<====>6601<====>Cyrus  Cyrus is the given name of a number of Persian kings.  Most notably it refers to Cyrus the Great.  Cyrus is also the name of Cyrus I of Anshan (ca.  650 BC), King of Persia the grandfather of Cyrus the Great; and Cyrus the Younger (died 401 BC), brother to the Persian King Artaxerxes II of Persia. EtymologyCyrus, as a word in English, is the Latinized form of the Greek  , Kȳros, from Old Persian   Kūruš.According to the inscriptions the name is reflected in Elamite Kuraš, Babylonian Ku(r)-raš/-ra-áš and Imperial Aramaic kwrš. 

Rendering (computer graphics)<====>6604<====>Rendering (computer graphics)  Rendering or image synthesis is the automatic process of generating a photorealistic or non-photorealistic image from a 2D or 3D model (or models in what collectively could be called a scene file) by means of computer programs.  Also, the results of displaying such a model can be called a render.  A scene file contains objects in a strictly defined language or data structure; it would contain geometry, viewpoint, texture, lighting, and shading information as a description of the virtual scene.  The data contained in the scene file is then passed to a rendering program to be processed and output to a digital image or raster graphics image file.

Compactification (mathematics)<====>6617<====>Compactification (mathematics)In mathematics, in general topology, compactification is the process or result of making a topological space into a compact space.   A compact space is a space in which every open cover of the space contains a finite subcover.  The methods of compactification are various, but each is a way of controlling points from "going off to infinity" by in some way adding "points at infinity" or preventing such an "escape". An exampleConsider the real line with its ordinary topology.  This space is not compact; in a sense, points can go off to infinity to the left or to the right. 

Cotangent space<====>6620<====>Cotangent spaceIn differential geometry, one can attach to every point x of a smooth (or differentiable) manifold a vector space called the cotangent space at x.  Typically, the cotangent space is defined as the dual space of the tangent space at x, although there are more direct definitions (see below).  The elements of the cotangent space are called cotangent vectors or tangent covectors. PropertiesAll cotangent spaces on a connected manifold have the same dimension, equal to the dimension of the manifold.  All the cotangent spaces of a manifold can be "glued together" (i. e.  unioned and endowed with a topology) to form a new differentiable manifold of twice the dimension, the cotangent bundle of the manifold. 

Cnidaria<====>6621<====>Cnidaria  Cnidaria (  ) is a phylum containing over 10,000    species of animals found exclusively in aquatic (freshwater and marine) environments: they are predominantly marine species.  Their distinguishing feature is cnidocytes, specialized cells that they use mainly for capturing prey.  Their bodies consist of mesoglea, a non-living jelly-like substance, sandwiched between two layers of epithelium that are mostly one cell thick.  They have two basic body forms: swimming medusae and sessile polyps, both of which are radially symmetrical with mouths surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes.  Both forms have a single orifice and body cavity that are used for digestion and respiration. 

Conservative Judaism<====>6623<====>Conservative Judaism  Conservative Judaism (known as Masorti Judaism outside North America) is a major Jewish denomination, which views Jewish Law, or Halakha, as both binding and subject to historical development.  The Conservative rabbinate therefore employs modern historical-critical research, rather than only traditional methods and sources, and lends great weight to its constituency when determining its stance on matters of Law.  The movement considers its approach as the authentic and most appropriate continuation of halakhic discourse, maintaining both fealty to received forms and flexibility in their interpretation.  It also eschews strict theological definitions, lacking a consensus in matters of faith and allowing great pluralism.

Clade<====>6682<====>Clade  A clade (from  , klados, "branch") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single "branch" on the "tree of life".    The common ancestor may be an individual, a population, a species (extinct or extant), and so on right up to a kingdom.  Clades are nested, one in another, as each branch in turn splits into smaller branches.  These splits reflect evolutionary history as populations diverged and evolved independently.  Clades are termed monophyletic (Greek: "one clan") groups. Over the last few decades, the cladistic approach has revolutionized biological classification and revealed surprising evolutionary relationships among organisms.

Coca-Cola<====>6690<====>Coca-Cola Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink  produced by The Coca-Cola Company.  Originally intended as a patent medicine, it was invented in the late 19th century by John Pemberton and was bought out by businessman Asa Griggs Candler, whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century.  The drink's name refers to two of its original ingredients, which were kola nuts (a source of caffeine) and coca leaves.  The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret, although a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published. 

Cofinality<====>6693<====>Cofinality In mathematics, especially in order theory, the cofinality cf(A) of a partially ordered set A is the least of the cardinalities of the cofinal subsets of A. This definition of cofinality relies on the axiom of choice, as it uses the fact that every non-empty set of cardinal numbers has a least member.  The cofinality of a partially ordered set A can alternatively be defined as the least ordinal x such that there is a function from x to A with cofinal image.  This second definition makes sense without the axiom of choice.  If the axiom of choice is assumed, as will be the case in the rest of this article, then the two definitions are equivalent. 

Citadel<====>6695<====>Citadel A citadel is the core fortified area of a town or city.  It may be a fortress, castle, or fortified center.

Gabriel, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007 P. 79    but there are examples of Etruscan pattern mail dating from at least the 4th century BC. 

Cerberus<====>6697<====>Cerberus  In Greek mythology, Cerberus ( ;    Kerberos  ), often called the "hound of Hades", is the monstrous multi-headed dog that guards the gates of the Underworld to prevent the dead from leaving.  Cerberus was the offspring of the monsters Echidna and Typhon, and usually is described as having three heads, a serpent for a tail, and snakes protruding from parts of his body.  Cerberus is primarily known for his capture by Heracles, one of Heracles' twelve labours. DescriptionsDescriptions of Cerberus vary, including the number of his heads.  Cerberus was usually three-headed, though not always. 

Camel case<====>6698<====>Camel case Camel case (stylized as camelCase or CamelCase; also known as camel caps or more formally as medial capitals) is the practice of writing compound words or phrases such that each word or abbreviation in the middle of the phrase begins with a capital letter, with no intervening spaces or punctuation.  Common examples include "iPhone ", "eBay", "FedEx", "DreamWorks", "HarperCollins", "iCarly", "WordWorld", and "WordGirl".  It is also sometimes used in online usernames such as "JohnSmith", and to make multi-word domain names more legible, for example in advertisements. Some systems prefer camelcase with the first letter capitalised, others not. 

Cereal<====>6700<====>Cereal  Cereal is any grass cultivated for the edible components of its grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran.  Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop  and are therefore staple crops.  Edible grains from other plant families, such as buckwheat (Polygonaceae), quinoa (Amaranthaceae) and chia (Lamiaceae), are referred to as pseudocereals. In their natural form (as in whole grain), cereals are a rich source of vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, oils, and protein.  When refined by the removal of the bran and germ, the remaining endosperm is mostly carbohydrate. 

Christendom<====>6704<====>ChristendomChristendom   has several meanings.  In one contemporary sense, as used in a secular or Protestant context, it may refer to the worldwide community of Christians, the adherents of Christianity, the Christian-majority countries, the countries in which Christianity dominates, See Merriam-Webster. com : dictionary, "Christendom"  or the nations in which Christianity is the established religion.  It is also used as synonymous with the Western world.   In its historical sense, the term usually refers to the Middle Ages and to the Early Modern period during which the Christian world represented a geopolitical power that was juxtaposed with both the pagan and especially the Muslim world. 

Coyote<====>6710<====>CoyoteThe coyote (Canis latrans); from Nahuatl  ) is a canine native to North America.  It is smaller than its close relative, the gray wolf, and slightly smaller than the closely related eastern wolf and red wolf.  It fills much of the same ecological niche as the golden jackal does in Eurasia, though it is larger and more predatory, and is sometimes called the American jackal by zoologists. The coyote is listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature due to its wide distribution and abundance throughout North America, southwards through Mexico, and into Central America. 

Conan the Barbarian<====>6713<====>Conan the Barbarian    Conan the Barbarian (also known as Conan the Cimmerian) is a fictional sword and sorcery hero who originated in pulp-fiction magazines and has since been adapted to books, comics, several films (including Conan the Barbarian and Conan the Destroyer), television programs (cartoon and live-action), video games, role-playing games, and other media.  The character was created by writer Robert E.  Howard in 1932 in a series of fantasy stories published in Weird Tales magazine. Publication historyConan the Barbarian was created by Robert E.

Chris Marker<====>6715<====>Chris Marker   Chris Marker ( ; 29 July 1921 – 29 July 2012) was a French writer, photographer, documentary film director, multimedia artist and film essayist.  His best known films are La Jetée (1962), Le Joli Mai (1963), A Grin Without a Cat (1977) and Sans Soleil (1983).  Marker is often associated with the Left Bank Cinema movement that occurred in the late 1950s and included such other filmmakers as Alain Resnais, Agnès Varda, Henri Colpi and Armand Gatti. His friend and sometime collaborator Alain Resnais called him "the prototype of the twenty-first-century man. " Wakeman, John. 

Cardinal vowels<====>6716<====>Cardinal vowels  Cardinal vowels are a set of reference vowels used by phoneticians in describing the sounds of languages.  For instance, the vowel of the English word "feet" can be described with reference to cardinal vowel 1,  , which is the cardinal vowel closest to it.  It is often stated that to be able to use the cardinal vowel system effectively one must undergo training with an expert phonetician, working both on the recognition and the production of the vowels.  Daniel Jones wrote "The values of cardinal vowels cannot be learnt from written descriptions; they should be learnt by oral instruction from a teacher who knows them". 

Columbia, Missouri<====>6719<====>Columbia, Missouri {{Infobox settlement }}Columbia   is a city in the U. S.  state of Missouri and the county seat of Boone County.Founded in 1821, it is home to the University of Missouri and is the principal city of the Columbia metropolitan area.  It is Missouri's fourth most-populous city, with an estimated 120,612 residents in 2016.

Cross-country skiing<====>6721<====>Cross-country skiing    Cross-country skiing is a form of skiing where skiers rely on their own locomotion to move across snow-covered terrain, rather than using ski lifts or other forms of assistance.  Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation.  Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport. Modern cross-country skiing is similar to the original form of skiing, from which all skiing disciplines evolved, including alpine skiing, ski jumping and Telemark skiing. 

Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro<====>6724<====>Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro  Copacabana ( local and standard    or  , rarely   and   in other Brazilian dialects) is a bairro (neighbourhood) located in the South Zone of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  It is known for its 4 km (2. 5 miles) balneario beach, which is one of the most famous in the world.  HistoryThe district was originally called Sacopenapã (translated from the Tupi language, it means "the way of the socós", the socós being a kind of bird) until the mid-18th century.  It was renamed after the construction of a chapel holding a replica of the Virgen de Copacabana, the patron saint of Bolivia. 

Cy Young Award<====>6725<====>Cy Young Award  The Cy Young Award is given annually to the best pitchers in Major League Baseball (MLB), one each for the American League (AL) and National League (NL).  The award was first introduced in 1956 by Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick in honor of Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young, who died in 1955.  The award was originally given to the single best pitcher in the major leagues, but in 1967, after the retirement of Frick, the award was given to one pitcher in each league.  Each league's award is voted on by members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, with one representative from each team. 

Christianity and antisemitism<====>6728<====>Christianity and antisemitism Christianity and antisemitism deals with the hostility of Christian Churches, Christian groups, and by Christians in general to Judaism and the Jewish people. Christian rhetoric and antipathy towards Jews developed in the early years of Christianity and was reinforced by the belief that Jews had killed Christ and ever increasing anti-Jewish measures over the ensuing centuries.  The action taken by Christians against Jews included acts of ostracism, humiliation and violence, and murder culminating in the Holocaust. Christian antisemitism has been attributed to numerous factors including theological differences, competition between Church and Synagogue, the Christian drive for converts,  decreed by the Great Commission, misunderstanding of Jewish beliefs and practices, and a perceived Jewish hostility toward Christians. 

Boeing C-17 Globemaster III<====>6731<====>Boeing C-17 Globemaster III   The Boeing C-17 Globemaster III is a large military transport aircraft.  It was developed for the United States Air Force (USAF) from the 1980s to the early 1990s by McDonnell Douglas.  The C-17 carries forward the name of two previous piston-engined military cargo aircraft, the Douglas C-74 Globemaster and the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II.  The C-17 commonly performs tactical and strategic airlift missions, transporting troops and cargo throughout the world; additional roles include medical evacuation and airdrop duties.  It was designed to replace the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter, and also fulfill some of the duties of the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, freeing the C-5 fleet for outsize cargo. 

Garbage collection (computer science)<====>6734<====>Garbage collection (computer science)  In computer science, garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management.  The garbage collector, or just collector, attempts to reclaim garbage, or memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program.  Garbage collection was invented by John McCarthy around 1959 to simplify manual memory management in Lisp.   Garbage collection is often portrayed as the opposite of manual memory management, which requires the programmer to specify which objects to deallocate and return to the memory system.  However, many systems use a combination of approaches, including other techniques such as stack allocation and region inference. 

Canidae<====>6736<====>Canidae  The biological family Canidae    (from Latin, canis, “dog”) is a lineage of carnivorans that includes domestic dogs, wolves, coyotes, foxes, jackals, dingoes, and many other extant and extinct dog-like mammals.  A member of this family is called a canid ( ,  ).  The cat-like feliforms and dog-like caniforms emerged within the Carnivoramorpha 43 million years before present.   The caniforms included the fox-like genus Leptocyon whose various species existed from 34 million years before present before branching 11. 9 million YBP into Vulpini (foxes) and Canini (canines).Canids are found on all continents except Antarctica, having arrived independently or accompanied human beings over extended periods of time. 

Subspecies of Canis lupus<====>6739<====>Subspecies of Canis lupusDISPLAYTITLE Canis lupus has 38 subspecies currently described, including the dingo, Canis lupus dingo, and the domestic dog, Canis lupus familiaris, and many subspecies of wolf throughout the Northern Hemisphere.  The nominate subspecies is Canis lupus lupus. Canis lupus is assessed as least concern by the IUCN, as its relatively widespread range and stable population trend mean that the species, at global level, does not meet, or nearly meet, any of the criteria for the threatened categories.  However, some local populations are classified as endangered,    and some subspecies are endangered or extinct. 

Central Asia<====>6742<====>Central Asia   Central Asia stretches from the Caspian Sea in the west to China in the east and from Afghanistan in the south to Russia in the north.  It is also colloquially referred to as "the stans" as the countries generally considered to be within the region all have names ending with the Persian suffix "-stan", meaning "land of".   Central Asia is sometimes referred to as Turkestan.    Central Asia has a population of about Expression error: Unrecognised punctuation character: "{" million, consisting of five republics: Kazakhstan (pop.

Couscous<====>6745<====>Couscous   Couscous (    ;    ) is a Maghrebi dish of small (about 3mm diameter) steamed balls of crushed durum wheat semolina,    usually served with a stew spooned on top.  Couscous is a staple food throughout the North African cuisines of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya and to a lesser extent in Sicily.   EtymologyThe original name may be derived from the Arabic word Kaskasa, meaning "to pound small" or the Berber Seksu, meaning "well rolled", "well formed", or "rounded".  Numerous different names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world. 

Constantius II<====>6746<====>Constantius II Constantius II ( ;   7 August 317 – 3 November 361) was Roman Emperor from 337 to 361.  The second son of Constantine I and Fausta, he ascended to the throne with his brothers Constantine II and Constans upon their father's death. In 340, Constantius' brothers clashed over the western provinces of the empire.  The resulting conflict left Constantine II dead and Constans as ruler of the west until he was overthrown and assassinated in 350 by the usurper Magnentius.  Unwilling to accept Magnentius as co-ruler, Constantius defeated him at the battles of Mursa Major and Mons Seleucus. 

Constans<====>6747<====>Constans  Constans ( ; Jones, p.  220  c.  323   – 350) or Constans I was Roman Emperor from 337 to 350.  He defeated his brother Constantine II in 340, but anger in the army over his personal life (homosexuality) and favouritism towards his barbarian bodyguards led the general Magnentius to rebel, resulting in the assassination of Constans in 350. CareerConstans was the third and youngest son of Constantine the Great and Fausta, his father's second wife.  DiMaio, Constans I (337–350 A. D. )   He was educated at the court of his father at Constantinople under the tutelage of the poet Aemilius Magnus Arborius. 

Cheerleading<====>6749<====>Cheerleading    Cheerleading is an activity wherein the participants (referred to as "cheerleaders") cheer for their team as a form of encouragement.  It can range from chanting slogans to intense physical activity.  It can be performed to motivate sports teams, entertain the audience, or for competition.  Competitive routines typically range anywhere from one to three minutes, and contain components of tumbling, dance, jumps, cheers, and stunting. Cheerleading originated in the United States, and remains predominantly in America, with an estimated 1. 5 million participants in all-star cheerleading.  The global presentation of cheerleading was led by the 1997 broadcast of  ESPN's International cheerleading competition, and the worldwide release of the 2000 film Bring It On. 

Cottingley Fairies<====>6751<====>Cottingley Fairies  The Cottingley Fairies appear in a series of five photographs taken by Elsie Wright (1901–88) and Frances Griffiths (1907–86), two young cousins who lived in Cottingley, near Bradford in England.  In 1917, when the first two photographs were taken, Elsie was 16 years old and Frances was 9.  The pictures came to the attention of writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who used them to illustrate an article on fairies he had been commissioned to write for the Christmas 1920 edition of The Strand Magazine.  Doyle, as a spiritualist, was enthusiastic about the photographs, and interpreted them as clear and visible evidence of psychic phenomena. 

Cheka<====>6752<====>Cheka  Cheka ( ) was the initialism for the first of a succession of Soviet secret police organizations.  Established on December 5 (Old Style), 1917 by the Sovnarkom , it came under the leadership of Felix Dzerzhinsky, a Polish aristocrat-turned-communist.By late 1918, hundreds of Cheka committees had sprung up in various cities at the oblast, guberniya, raion, uyezd, and volost levels. In 1921 the Troops for the Internal Defense of the Republic (a branch of the Cheka) numbered at least 200,000.These troops policed labor camps; ran the Gulag system; conducted requisitions of food; subjected political opponents to secret arrest, detention, torture and summary execution; and put down  rebellions and riots by workers  or peasants, and mutinies in the desertion-plagued Red Army. 

Clitic<====>6753<====>CliticA clitic (  from Greek κλιτικός klitikos, "inflexional") is a morpheme in morphology and syntax that has syntactic characteristics of a word, but depends phonologically on another word or phrase.  In this sense, it is syntactically independent but phonologically dependent, always attached to a host.  SIL International (2003).  SIL Glossary of Linguistic Terms: What is a clitic?

Context-free grammar<====>6759<====>Context-free grammar In formal language theory, a context-free grammar (CFG) is a certain type of formal grammar:  a set of production rules that describe all possible strings in a given formal language.  Production rules are simple replacements.  For example, the rule A\ \to\ \alpha replaces  A  with  \alpha .  There can be multiple replacement rules for any given value.  For example, A\ \to\ \alpha  A\ \to\ \beta means that  A  can be replaced with either  \alpha  or  \beta . In context-free grammars, all rules are one-to-one, one-to-many, or one-to-none. 

Cryonics<====>6760<====>Cryonics Cryonics (from Greek κρύος kryos meaning 'cold') is the low-temperature preservation (usually at −196°C) of people who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that   and restoration to full health may be possible in the far future.Cryopreservation of humans is not reversible with present technology; cryonicists hope that medical advances will someday allow cryopreserved people to be revived.    Cryonics is regarded with skepticism within the mainstream scientific community and is not part of normal medical practice.  It is not known if it will ever be possible to revive a cryopreserved human being. 

Unitary patent<====>6761<====>Unitary patent   Unitary patent in the European Union    The European patent with unitary effect (EPUE), more commonly known as the unitary patent, is a new type of European patent in advanced stage of adoption which would be valid in participating member states of the European Union.   Unitary effect can be registered for a European patent upon grant, replacing validation of the European patent in the individual countries concerned.  The unitary effect means a single renewal fee, a single ownership, a single object of property, a single court (the Unified Patent Court) and uniform protection—which means that revocation as well as infringement proceedings are to be decided for the unitary patent as a whole rather than for each country individually. 

Cistron<====>6763<====>CistronA cistron is an alternative term to a gene.   The term cistron is used to emphasize that genes exhibit a specific behavior in a cis-trans test; distinct positions (or loci) within a genome are cistronic. HistoryThe words cistron and gene were coined before the advancing state of biology made it clear that the concepts they refer to are practically equivalent.  The same historical naming practices are responsible for many of the synonyms in the life sciences. The term cistron was coined by Seymour Benzer in an article entitled The elementary units of heredity.   The cistron was defined by an operational test applicable to most organisms that is sometimes referred to as a cis-trans test, but more often as a complementation test. 

Commonwealth<====>6766<====>Commonwealth Commonwealth is a traditional English term for a political community founded for the common good.  Historically it has sometimes been synonymous with "republic". The noun "commonwealth", meaning "public welfare general good or advantage" dates from the 15th century.  Originally a phrase (the common-wealth or the common weal – echoed in the modern synonym "public weal") it comes from the old meaning of "wealth", which is "well-being", and is itself a loose translation of the Latin res publica (republic).  The term literally meant "common well-being".  In the 17th century, the definition of "commonwealth" expanded from its original sense of "public welfare" or "commonweal" to mean "a state in which the supreme power is vested in the people; a republic or democratic state". 

Commodore 1541<====>6767<====>Commodore 1541  The Commodore 1541 (also known as the CBM 1541 and VIC-1541) is a floppy disk drive  which was made by Commodore International for the Commodore 64 (C64), Commodore's most popular home computer.  The best-known floppy disk drive for the C64, the 1541 is a single-sided 170-kilobyte drive for 5¼" disks.  The 1541 directly followed the Commodore 1540 (meant for the VIC-20). The disk drive uses group coded recording (GCR) and contains a MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor, doubling as a disk controller and on-board disk operating system processor.  The number of sectors per track varies from 17 to 21 (an early implementation of zone bit recording). 

Commodore 1581<====>6769<====>Commodore 1581  The Commodore 1581 is a 3½-inch double-sided double-density floppy disk drive that was released by Commodore Business Machines (CBM) in 1987, primarily for its C64 and C128 home/personal computers.  The drive stores 800 kilobytes using an MFM encoding tds. net - 1581 DISK DRIVE DIAGNOSTICS, latest updates and corrections 7-13-05  but format different from MS-DOS (720 kB), Amiga (880 kB), and Mac Plus (800 kB) formats.

College football<====>6771<====>College football  College football is American football played by teams of student athletes fielded by American universities, colleges, and military academies, or Canadian football played by teams of student athletes fielded by Canadian universities.  It was through college football play that American football rules first gained popularity in the United States. Unlike most other sports in North America, no minor league farm organizations exist in American or Canadian football.  Therefore, college football is generally considered to be the second tier of American football in the United States and Canadian football in Canada; one step ahead of high school competition, and one step below professional competition. 

Ciprofloxacin<====>6773<====>Ciprofloxacin    Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic used to treat a number of bacterial infections.This includes bone and joint infections, intra abdominal infections, certain type of infectious diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, skin infections, typhoid fever, and urinary tract infections, among others.   For some infections it is used in addition to other antibiotics.   It can be taken by mouth or used intravenously.   Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and rash.   Ciprofloxacin increases the risk of tendon rupture and worsening muscle weakness in people with the neurological disorder myasthenia gravis. 

Consubstantiation<====>6774<====>Consubstantiation  Consubstantiation is a Christian theological doctrine that (like Transubstantiation) describes the Real Presence  in the Eucharist.  It holds that during the sacrament, the substance of the body and blood of Christ are present alongside the substance of the bread and wine, which remain present.  It was part of the doctrines of Lollardy and considered a heresy by the Roman Catholic Church. UseThe doctrine of consubstantiation is often held in contrast to the doctrine of transubstantiation.  While some Lutherans use the term "consubstantiation" to describe their doctrine, many reject it as not accurately reflecting the eucharistic doctrine of Martin Luther, the sacramental union. 

Chlorophyta<====>6775<====>Chlorophyta Chlorophyta is a division of green algae, informally called chlorophytes.  The name is used in two very different senses, so care is needed to determine the use by a particular author.  In older classification systems, it refers to a highly paraphyletic group of all the green algae within the green plants (Viridiplantae) and thus includes about 7,000 species Hoek, C.  van den, Mann, D. G.  and Jahns, H. M.  1995.  Algae An Introduction to Phycology.  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. of mostly aquatic photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms.  In newer classifications, it refers to one of the two clades making up the Viridiplantae, which are the chlorophytes and the streptophytes. 

Capybara<====>6776<====>Capybara   The capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is the largest living rodent in the world.  Also called chigüire and carpincho, it is a member of the genus Hydrochoerus, of which the only other extant member is the lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius).   Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the coypu.  Native to South America, the capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests and lives near bodies of water.  It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals, but usually lives in groups of 10–20 individuals. 

Computer animation<====>6777<====>Computer animation Computer animation is the process used for generating animated images.  The more general term computer-generated imagery (CGI) encompasses both static scenes and dynamic images, while computer animation only refers to the moving images.  Modern computer animation usually uses 3D computer graphics, although 2D computer graphics are still used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time renderings.  Sometimes, the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes film as well. Computer animation is essentially a digital successor to the stop motion techniques using 3D models, and traditional animation techniques using frame-by-frame animation of 2D illustrations. 

Ceawlin of Wessex<====>6778<====>Ceawlin of Wessex  Ceawlin (also spelled Ceaulin and Caelin, died ca.  593) was a King of Wessex.  He may have been the son of Cynric of Wessex and the grandson of Cerdic of Wessex, whom the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle represents as the leader of the first group of Saxons to come to the land which later became Wessex.  Ceawlin was active during the last years of the Anglo-Saxon expansion, with little of southern England remaining in the control of the native Britons by the time of his death. The chronology of Ceawlin's life is highly uncertain.  The historical accuracy and dating of many of the events in the later Anglo-Saxon Chronicle have been called into question, and his reign is variously listed as lasting seven, seventeen, or thirty-two years. 

CD-R<====>6780<====>CD-R    CD-R (Compact Disc-Recordable) is a digital optical disc storage format.  A CD-R disc is a compact disc that can be written once and read arbitrarily many times. CD-R discs (CD-Rs) are readable by most plain CD readers, i. e. , CD readers manufactured prior to the introduction of CD-R.  This is an advantage over CD-RW, which can be re-written but cannot be played on many plain CD readers. HistoryThe CD-R, originally named CD Write-Once (WO), specification was first published in 1988 by Philips and Sony in the 'Orange Book'.  The Orange Book consists of several parts, furnishing details of the CD-WO, CD-MO (Magneto-Optic), and CD-RW (ReWritable). 

Cytosol<====>6781<====>Cytosol The cytosol or cytoplasmic matrix is the liquid found inside cells.  It constitutes most of the intracellular fluid (ICF).  It is separated into compartments by membranes.  For example, the mitochondrial matrix separates the mitochondrion into many compartments. In the eukaryotic cell, the cytosol is within the cell membrane and is part of the cytoplasm, which also comprises the mitochondria, plastids, and other organelles (but not their internal fluids and structures); the cell nucleus is separate.  The cytosol is thus a liquid matrix around the organelles.  In prokaryotes, most of the chemical reactions of metabolism take place in the cytosol, while a few take place in membranes or in the periplasmic space. 

Citizenship<====>6784<====>Citizenship  Citizenship is the status of a person recognized under the custom or law as being a legal member of a sovereign state or part of a nation. A person may have multiple citizenships and a person who does not have citizenship of any state is said to be stateless. Nationality is often used as a synonym for citizenship in English  – notably in international law – although the term is sometimes understood as denoting a person's membership of a nation (a large ethnic group).   In some countries, e. g.  the United States, the United Kingdom, nationality and citizenship can have different meanings (for more information, see Nationality versus citizenship). 

Chiapas<====>6787<====>Chiapas Chiapas ( ), officially the Free and Sovereign State of Chiapas ( ), is one of the 31 states that with Mexico City make up the 32 federal entities of Mexico.  It is divided into 124 municipalities as of September 2017   and its capital city is Tuxtla Gutiérrez.  Other important population centers in Chiapas include Ocosingo, Tapachula, San Cristóbal de las Casas, Comitán and Arriaga.  It is the southernmost state, bordered by the states of Oaxaca to the west, Veracruz to the northwest and Tabasco to the north,    and by the Petén, Quiché, Huehuetenango and San Marcos departments of Guatemala to the east and southeast. 

Chrysler Building<====>6788<====>Chrysler Building    The Chrysler Building is an Art Deco-style skyscraper located on the East Side of Midtown Manhattan in New York City, at the intersection of 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue in the Turtle Bay neighborhood of Manhattan.  At  , the structure was the world's tallest building for 11 months before it was surpassed by the Empire State Building in 1931. It is the tallest brick building in the world with a steel framework.   , the Chrysler is the fifth-tallest building in the city.  Originally a project of real estate developer and former New York State Senator William H. 

Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9<====>6794<====>Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9    Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 (formally designated D/1993 F2) was a comet that broke apart in July 1992 and collided with Jupiter in July 1994, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of Solar System objects.This generated a large amount of coverage in the popular media, and the comet was closely observed by astronomers worldwide.  The collision provided new information about Jupiter and highlighted its possible role in reducing space debris in the inner Solar System. The comet was discovered by astronomers Carolyn and Eugene M.  Shoemaker and David Levy. 

Ceres Brewery<====>6796<====>Ceres Brewery  Ceres Brewery was a brewery company located in Aarhus, Denmark.  It was part of Royal Unibrew.  The factories in central Aarhus, was closed in 2008 and the grounds are now being redeveloped into a new neighbourhood of the city, known as CeresByen (The CeresCity).  HistoryCeres Brewery was founded by a grocer named Malthe Conrad Lottrup, with help from the chemists A.  S.  Aagard and Knud Redelien, as the city's seventh brewery.  It was named after the Roman goddess Ceres, and its opening was announced in the local newspaper, Stiftstidende, in 1856. 

COBOL<====>6799<====>COBOL    COBOL ( , an acronym for  common business-oriented language) is a compiled English-like computer programming language designed for business use.  It is imperative, procedural and, since 2002, object-oriented.  COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments.   COBOL is still widely used in legacy applications deployed on mainframe computers, such as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs.  But due to its declining popularity and the retirement of experienced COBOL programmers, programs are being migrated to new platforms, rewritten in modern languages or replaced with software packages. 

Crew<====>6801<====>Crew A crew is a body or a class of people who work at a common activity, generally in a structured or hierarchical organization.  A location in which a crew works is called a crewyard or a workyard .  The word has nautical resonances: the tasks involved in operating a ship, particularly a sailing ship, providing numerous specialities within a ship's crew, often organised with a chain of command.  Traditional nautical usage strongly distinguishes officers from crew, though the two groups combined form the ship's company.  Members of a crew are often referred to by the title Crewman. 

Charge-coupled device<====>6804<====>Charge-coupled deviceA charge-coupled device (CCD) is a device for the movement of electrical charge, usually from within the device  to an area where the charge can be manipulated, for example conversion into a digital value.  This is achieved by "shifting" the signals between stages within the device one at a time.  CCDs move charge between capacitive bins in the device, with the shift allowing for the transfer of charge between bins. In recent years CCD has become a major technology for digital imaging.  In a CCD image sensor, pixels are represented by p-doped metal-oxide-semiconductors (MOS) capacitors. 

Computer memory<====>6806<====>Computer memory  In computing, memory refers to the computer hardware integrated circuits that store information for immediate use in a computer; it is synonymous with the term "primary storage".  Computer memory operates at a high speed, for example random-access memory (RAM), as a distinction from storage that provides slow-to-access information but offers higher capacities.  If needed, contents of the computer memory can be transferred to secondary storage, through a memory management technique called "virtual memory".  An archaic synonym for memory is store.  The term "memory", meaning "primary storage" or "main memory", is often associated with addressable semiconductor memory, i. 

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention<====>6811<====>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the leading national public health institute of the United States.  The CDC is a United States federal agency under the Department of Health and Human Services, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.  Its main goal is to protect public health and safety through the control and prevention of disease, injury, and disability in the US and internationally.   The CDC focuses national attention on developing and applying disease control and prevention.  It especially focuses its attention on infectious disease, food borne pathogens, environmental health, occupational safety and health, health promotion, injury prevention and educational activities designed to improve the health of United States citizens. 

Chandrasekhar limit<====>6813<====>Chandrasekhar limitThe Chandrasekhar  limit ( ) is the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf star.   The limit was first indicated in papers published by Wilhelm Anderson and E.  C.  Stoner in 1929.  It was named after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, the Indian astrophysicist who independently discovered and improved upon the accuracy of the calculation in 1930, at the age of 20, in India.   The limit was initially ignored by the community of scientists because such a limit would logically require the existence of black holes, which were considered a scientific impossibility at the time. 

Congregationalist polity<====>6814<====>Congregationalist polity  Congregationalist polity, or Congregational polity, often known as congregationalism, is a system of church governance ("ecclesiastical polity") in which every local church congregation is independent, ecclesiastically sovereign, or "autonomous".  Its first articulation in writing is the Cambridge Platform of 1648 in New England.  Among those major Protestant Christian traditions that employ congregationalism are those Congregational Churches known by the "Congregationalist" name that descended from the Independent Reformed wing of the Anglo-American Puritan movement of the 17th century, Quakerism, the Baptist churches, and most of the groups brought about by the Anabaptist movement in Germany that migrated to the U. 

Cavalry<====>6816<====>Cavalry   Cavalry (from French cavalerie, cf.  cheval 'horse') or horsemen were soldiers or warriors who fought mounted on horseback.  Cavalry were historically the most mobile of the combat arms.  An individual soldier in the cavalry is known by a number of designations such as cavalryman, horseman, dragoon or trooper.  The designation of cavalry was not usually given to any military forces that used other animals, such as camels, mules or elephants.  Infantry who moved on horseback, but dismounted to fight on foot, were known in the 17th and early 18th centuries as dragoons, a class of mounted infantry which later evolved into cavalry proper while retaining their historic title. 

Citric acid cycle<====>6818<====>Citric acid cycleThe citric acid cycle (CAC) – also known as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle or the Krebs cycle  – is a series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic organisms to release stored  energy through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into carbon dioxide and chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).   In addition, the cycle provides precursors of certain amino acids, as well as the reducing agent NADH, that are used in numerous other biochemical reactions.   Its central importance to many biochemical pathways suggests that it was one of the earliest established components of cellular metabolism and may have originated abiogenically. 

Military engineering vehicle<====>6821<====>Military engineering vehicle A military engineering vehicle is a vehicle built for the construction work or for the transportation of combat engineers on the battlefield.   These vehicles may be modified civilian equipment or purpose-built military vehicles. HistoryWorld War OneA Heavy RE tank was developed shortly after World War I by Major Giffard LeQuesne Martel RE.  [1]This vehicle was a modified Mark V tank.  Two support functions for these Engineer Tanks were developed: bridging and mine clearance.  The bridging component involved an assault bridge, designed by Major Charles Inglis RE, called the Canal Lock Bridge, which had sufficient length to span a canal lock. 

Catalonia<====>6822<====>Catalonia Catalonia ( ,  ,  )  is an autonomous community of Spain located on the northeastern extremity of the Iberian Peninsula.  It is one of Spain's eight communities which are designated as a nationality by their Statute of Autonomy.Catalonia consists of four provinces: Barcelona, Girona, Lleida, and Tarragona.  The capital and largest city is Barcelona, the second-most populated municipality in Spain and the core of the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union.  Catalonia comprises most of the territory of the former Principality of Catalonia (with the remainder Roussillon now part of France's Pyrénées-Orientales). 

Constantine Kanaris<====>6823<====>Constantine Kanaris{{Infobox Prime Minister }}Constantine Kanaris or Canaris ( ; 1793 or 1795 September 2, 1877) was a Greek Prime Minister, admiral and politician who in his youth was a freedom fighter in the Greek War of Independence.  Woodhouse, p.  129.  Early lifeHe was born and grew up on the island of Psara, close to the island of Chios, in the Aegean.  His exact year of birth is unknown.  The official records of the Hellenic Navy indicate 1795 but modern Greek historians believe that 1793 is more probable. Constantine was left an orphan at a young age. 

Carl Sagan<====>6824<====>Carl Sagan  Carl Edward Sagan ( ; November 9, 1934 – December 20, 1996) was an American astronomer, cosmologist, astrophysicist, astrobiologist, author, science popularizer, and science communicator in astronomy and other natural sciences.  He is best known for his work as a science popularizer and communicator.  His best known scientific contribution is research on extraterrestrial life, including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation.  Sagan assembled the first physical messages sent into space: the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden Record, universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them. 

Cuban Missile Crisis<====>6827<====>Cuban Missile Crisis   The Cuban Missile Crisis, also known as the October Crisis ( ), the Caribbean Crisis ( ), or the Missile Scare, was a 13-day (October 16–28, 1962) confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union concerning American ballistic missile deployment in Italy and Turkey with consequent Soviet ballistic missile deployment in Cuba.  The confrontation is often considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into a full-scale nuclear war.  In response to the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961 and the presence of American Jupiter ballistic missiles in Italy and Turkey, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev decided to agree to Cuba's request to place nuclear missiles on the island to deter a future invasion. 

Aquilegia<====>6828<====>Aquilegia   Aquilegia (common names: granny's  bonnet  or columbine) is a genus of about 60-70 species  of perennial plants that are found in meadows, woodlands, and at higher altitudes throughout the Northern Hemisphere, known for the spurred petals  Puzey, J. R. , Gerbode, S. J. , Hodges, S. A. , Kramer, E. M. , Mahadevan, L.  (2011) Evolution of Aquilegia spur length diversity through changes in cell anisotropy.  Proceedings of the Royal Society B.   of their flowers. EtymologyThe genus name Aquilegia is derived from the Latin word for eagle (aquila), because of the shape of the flower petals, which are said to resemble an eagle's claw. 

Cache (computing)<====>6829<====>Cache (computing)   In computing, a cache    ,    is a hardware or software component that stores data so future requests for that data can be served faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation, or the duplicate of data stored elsewhere.   A cache hit occurs when the requested data can be found in a cache, while a cache miss occurs when it cannot.   Cache hits are served by reading data from the cache, which is faster than recomputing a result or reading from a slower data store; thus, the more requests can be served from the cache, the faster the system performs. 

Columbus, Indiana<====>6830<====>Columbus, Indiana  Columbus   is a city in and the county seat of Bartholomew County, Indiana, United States.The population was 44,061 at the 2010 census.  In its built environment, the relatively small city has provided a unique place for noted Modern architecture and public art, commissioning numerous works since the mid-20th century.  Located about 40 miles (64 km) south of Indianapolis, on the east fork of the White River, it is the state's 20th-largest city.  It is the principal city of the Columbus, Indiana metropolitan statistical area, which encompasses all of Bartholomew County. 

List of computer scientists<====>6834<====>List of computer scientists   This is a list of computer scientists, people who do work in computer science, in particular researchers and authors. Some persons notable as programmers are included here because they work in research as well as program.  A few of these people pre-date the invention of the digital computer; they are now regarded as computer scientists because their work can be seen as leading to the invention of the computer.  Others are mathematicians whose work falls within what would now be called theoretical computer science, such as complexity theory and algorithmic information theory. 

Cultural production and nationalism<====>6836<====>Cultural production and nationalism Literature, visual arts, music, and scholarship have complex relationships with ideological forces. The 19th CenturyIn the 19th century nationalism was an especially potent influence on all of these fields.   To summarize, every established national group used cultural productions to assert and strengthen a sense of national unity and destiny; less politically consolidated groups, especially those pursuing the goal of nationhood, used them in the same ways, though often with a note of determination that makes them easier to see from our contemporary point of reference. Natural admiration for excellence and justifiable pride in a predecessor's achievements is sometimes difficult to sort out from other intentions. 

CRESU experiment<====>6839<====>CRESU experiment The CRESU experiment ( ) is an experiment investigating chemical reactions taking place at very low temperatures.   The technique involves the expansion of a gas or mixture of gases through a de Laval nozzle from a high pressure reservoir into a vacuum chamber.  As it expands, the nozzle collimates the gas into a uniform supersonic beam that is essentially collision free and has a temperature that, in the centre of mass frame, can be significantly below that of the reservoir gas.  Each nozzle produces a characteristic temperature.  This way, any temperature between room temperature and about 10K can be achieved. 

Cygwin<====>6840<====>Cygwin  Cygwin (    ) is a Unix-like environment and command-line interface for Microsoft Windows.  Cygwin provides native integration of Windows-based applications, data, and other system resources with applications, software tools, and data of the Unix-like environment.  Thus it is possible to launch Windows applications from the Cygwin environment, as well as to use Cygwin tools and applications within the Windows operating context. Cygwin consists of two parts: a dynamic-link library (DLL) as an API compatibility layer in the form of a C standard library providing a substantial part of the POSIX API functionality, and an extensive collection of software tools and applications that provide a Unix-like look and feel. 

Corinth<====>6845<====>Corinth    Corinth ( ;  , Kórinthos,  ) is an ancient city and former municipality in Corinthia, Peloponnese, which is located in south-central Greece.  Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality of Corinth, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit.  Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior    It is the capital of Corinthia. It was founded as Nea Korinthos or New Corinth (Νέα Κόρινθος) in 1858 after an earthquake destroyed the existing settlement of Corinth, which had developed in and around the site of ancient Corinth. 

Colossae<====>6846<====>Colossae Colossae ( ; Greek:  ) was an ancient city of Phrygia in Asia Minor, and was the location to which the Apostle Paul directed his Epistle to the Colossians.   A significant city from the 5th Century BC onwards, it had dwindled in importance by the time of Paul, but was notable for the existence of its local angel cult.   It was part of the Roman - and then Byzantine - province of Phrygia Pacatiana, before being destroyed in 1192/3 and its population relocating to nearby Chonae (modern day Honaz).   Origin and etymology of place name Location and geographyColossae was located in Phrygia, in Asia Minor. 

Charge of the Goddess<====>6848<====>Charge of the Goddess   The Charge of the Goddess (or Charge of the Star Goddess) is an inspirational text often used in the neopagan religion of Wicca.  The Charge of the Goddess is recited during most rituals in which the Wiccan priest/priestess is expected to represent, and/or embody, the Goddess within the sacred circle, and is often spoken by the High Priest/Priestess after the ritual of Drawing Down the Moon. The Charge is the promise of the Goddess (who is embodied by the high priestess) to all witches that she will teach and guide them.  It has been called "perhaps the most important single theological document in the neo-Pagan movement". 

Cy Young<====>6849<====>Cy Young  Denton True "Cy" Young (March 29, 1867 – November 4, 1955) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher.  During his 22-season baseball career (1890–1911), he pitched for five different teams.  Young established numerous pitching records, some of which have stood for over a century.  Young compiled 511 wins, which is most in Major League history and 94 ahead of Walter Johnson, second on the list.   Young was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937. One year after Young's death, the Cy Young Award was created to honor each previous season's best pitcher. 

Coronation Street<====>6851<====>Coronation Street    Coronation Street (informally known as Corrie) is a British soap opera created by Granada Television and shown on ITV since 9 December 1960.   The programme centres on Coronation Street in Weatherfield, a fictional town based on inner-city Salford,  its terraced houses, café, corner shop, newsagents, building yard, taxicab office, salon, restaurant, textile factory and the Rovers Return pub.  In the show's fictional history, the street was built in 1902 and named in honour of the coronation of King Edward VII. The show airs six times a week: Monday, Wednesday and Friday 7:30–8 pm and 8:30–9 pm. 

Caligula<====>6852<====>Caligula   Caligula ( ; Classical Latin spelling and reconstructed Classical Latin pronunciation of the names of Caligula:  or    Latin: Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus; 31 August AD 12 – 24 January AD 41), formally known as Gaius Caesar, was Roman emperor from AD 37 to AD 41.  The son of Germanicus, a popular Roman general, and Agrippina the Elder, the granddaughter of Augustus.  Caligula was born into the first ruling family of the Roman Empire, conventionally known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty.  Two years after Caligula's birth, Germanicus' uncle and adoptive father, Tiberius, succeeded Augustus as emperor of Rome in AD 14. 

Church–Turing thesis<====>6854<====>Church–Turing thesis In computability theory, the Church–Turing thesis (also known as computability thesis,  the  Turing–Church thesis,  the Church–Turing conjecture, Church's thesis, Church's conjecture, and Turing's thesis) is a hypothesis about the nature of computable functions.  It states that a function on the natural numbers is computable by a human being following an algorithm, ignoring resource limitations, if and only if it is computable by a Turing machine.  The thesis is named after American mathematician Alonzo Church and the British mathematician Alan Turing.  Before the precise definition of computable function, mathematicians often used the informal term effectively calculable to describe functions that are computable by paper-and-pencil methods. 

Chomsky (surname)<====>6856<====>Chomsky (surname) Chomsky ( ,  ,  ,  , "from (Vyoska) Khomsk (nearby Brest, now Belarus)" ) is a surname of Belarusian origin.  Notable people with the surname include:Aviva Chomsky (born 1957), American historianCarol (Schatz) Chomsky (1930–2008), American linguist and wife of Noam ChomskyJudith Chomsky (born 1942), American human rights lawyer and co-founder of the Juvenile Law CenterMarvin J.

I. William Chomsky (1896–1977), American scholar of Hebrew Elsie, William, Avram Noam, Carol, Marvin, and Aviva are all closely related. 

Computer multitasking<====>6857<====>Computer multitasking  In computing, multitasking is the concurrent execution of multiple tasks (also known as processes) over a certain period of time.   New tasks can interrupt already started ones before they finish, instead of waiting for them to end.  As a result, a computer executes segments of multiple tasks in an interleaved manner, while the tasks share common processing resources such as central processing units (CPUs) and main memory.  Multitasking automatically interrupts the running program, saving its state (partial results, memory contents and computer register contents) and loading the saved state of another program and transferring control to it. 

Chiang Kai-shek<====>6859<====>Chiang Kai-shekChiang Kai-shek ( ; 31 October 1887 – 5 April 1975), also romanized as Chiang Chieh-shih and known as Chiang Chungcheng ( ), was a political and military leader who served as the leader of the Republic of China. Chiang – who led the Republic of China between 1928 and 1975 – was an influential member of the Kuomintang (KMT), the Chinese Nationalist Party, as well as a close ally of Sun Yat-sen's.  Chiang became the Commandant of the Kuomintang's Whampoa Military Academy and took Sun's place as leader of the KMT following the Canton Coup in early 1926. 

Compression ratio<====>6863<====>Compression ratio  The static compression ratio of an internal combustion engine or external combustion engine is a value that represents the ratio of the volume of its combustion chamber from its largest capacity to its smallest capacity.  It is a fundamental specification for many common combustion engines. In a piston engine, it is the ratio between the volume of the cylinder and combustion chamber when the piston is at the bottom of its stroke, and the volume of the combustion chamber when the piston is at the top of its stroke.    For example, a cylinder and its combustion chamber with the piston at the bottom of its stroke may contain 1000 cc of air (900 cc in the cylinder plus 100 cc in the combustion chamber). 

Concordat of Worms<====>6865<====>Concordat of WormsThe Concordat of Worms ( ),  sometimes called the Pactum Calixtinum by papal historians,  was an agreement between Pope Callixtus II and Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor on September 23, 1122, near the city of Worms.  It brought to an end the first phase of the power struggle between the Papacy and the Holy Roman Emperors and has been interpreted  as containing within itself the germ of nation-based sovereignty that would one day be confirmed in the Peace of Westphalia (1648).  In part this was an unforeseen result of strategic maneuvering between the Church and the European sovereigns over political control within their domains. 

Context-free language<====>6867<====>Context-free languageIn formal language theory, a  context-free language (CFL) is a language generated by a context-free grammar (CFG). Context-free languages have many applications in programming languages, in particular, most arithmetic expressions are generated by context-free grammars. BackgroundContext-free grammarDifferent context-free grammars can generate the same context-free language.  Intrinsic properties of the language can be distinguished from extrinsic properties of a particular grammar by comparing multiple grammars that describe the language. AutomataThe set of all context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by pushdown automata, which makes these languages amenable  to parsing.  Further, for a given CFG, there is a direct way to produce a pushdown automaton for the grammar (and thereby the corresponding language), though going the other way (producing a grammar given an automaton) is not as direct. 

Caffeine<====>6868<====>CaffeineCaffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class.It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug.  Unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world.  There are several known mechanisms of action to explain the effects of caffeine.  The most prominent is that it reversibly blocks the action of adenosine on its receptor and consequently prevents the onset of drowsiness induced by adenosine.  Caffeine also stimulates certain portions of the autonomic nervous system.  Caffeine is a bitter, white crystalline purine, a methylxanthine alkaloid, and is chemically related to the adenine and guanine bases of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). 

Cyc<====>6874<====>Cyc  Cyc ( ) is the world's longest-lived artificial intelligence project, attempting to assemble a comprehensive ontology and knowledge base that spanns the basic concepts and "rules of thumb" about how the world works (think common sense knowledge but focusing more on things that rarely get written down or said, in contrast with facts one might find somewhere on the internet or retrieve via Google or Wikipedia), with the goal of enabling AI applications to perform human-like reasoning and be less "brittle" when confronted with novel situations that were not preconceived. Douglas Lenat began the project in July, 1984 at MCC, where he was Principal Scientist 1984-1994, and then, since January 1995, has been under active development by the Cycorp company, where he is the CEO. 

Carlos Valderrama<====>6878<====>Carlos Valderrama   Carlos Alberto Valderrama Palacio ( ;  born 2 September 1961 in Santa Marta, Colombia), also known as El Pibe ("The Kid"),    is a Colombian former footballer who played as a midfielder.  A creative playmaker, known for his precise passing, technical skills, and elegance on the ball, he is regarded as one of the best Colombian and South American footballers of all time, and by some as Colombia's greatest player ever; his distinctive hairstyle, as well as talent and skilful playing style made him one of South America's elite and most recognisable footballers in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 

Caesar salad<====>6880<====>Caesar salad  A Caesar salad is a salad of romaine lettuce and croutons dressed with parmesan cheese, lemon juice, olive oil, egg, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and black pepper.  It is traditionally prepared tableside.  History The salad's creation is generally attributed to restaurateur Caesar Cardini, an Italian immigrant who operated restaurants in Mexico and the United States.Cardini was living in San Diego but he was also working in Tijuana where he avoided the restrictions of Prohibition.His daughter Rosa (1928–2003) recounted that her father invented the salad when a Fourth of July 1924 rush depleted the kitchen's supplies. 

Cecilia Beaux<====>6881<====>Cecilia Beaux Cecilia Beaux (May 1, 1855 – September 7, 1942) was an American society portraitist, in the manner of John Singer Sargent.  She was a near-contemporary of American artist Mary Cassatt and also received her training in Philadelphia and France.  Her sympathetic renderings of the American ruling class made her one of the most successful portrait painters of her era. BiographyEarly lifeEliza Cecilia Beaux was born on May 1, 1855 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Kuiper, Kathleen.  "Cecilia Beaux", Encyclopædia Britannica Online, Retrieved 22 May 2015.   She was the youngest daughter of French silk manufacturer Jean Adolphe Beaux and teacher Cecilia Kent Leavitt.

V. , an Italian-American automobile manufacturer registered in the Netherlands with headquarters in London, U. K. , for tax purposes.FCA US is one of the "Big Three" American automobile manufacturers.  FCA US has its headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan and sells vehicles worldwide under its flagship Chrysler brand, as well as the Dodge, Jeep, and Ram Trucks.  Other major divisions include Mopar, its automotive parts and accessories division, and SRT, its performance automobile division. 

City of London<====>6883<====>City of LondonThe City of London is a city and county that contains the historic centre and the primary central business district (CBD) of London.  It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders.The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London.  Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster). 

Clitoris<====>6884<====>ClitorisThe clitoris (  or  ) is a female sex organ present in mammals, ostriches and a limited number of other animals.  In humans, the visible button-like portion is near the front junction of the labia minora (inner lips), above the opening of the urethra.  Unlike the penis, the male homologue (equivalent) to the clitoris, it usually does not contain the distal portion (or opening) of the urethra and is therefore not used for urination.  While few animals urinate through the clitoris, the spotted hyena, which has an especially well-developed clitoris, urinates, mates and gives birth via the organ. 

Chicago<====>6886<====>Chicago    Chicago (  or  ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States.  With over 2. 7 million residents, it is also the most populous city in both the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States.  It is the county seat of Cook County.  The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the United States.  Chicago has often been called a global architecture capital  and is considered one of the most important business centers in the world. 

Cyrix 6x86<====>6887<====>Cyrix 6x86 The Cyrix 6x86 (codename M1) is a sixth-generation, 32-bit x86-compatible microprocessor designed by Cyrix and manufactured by IBM and SGS-Thomson.  It was originally released in 1996. ArchitectureThe 6x86 is superscalar and superpipelined and performs register renaming, speculative execution, out-of-order execution, and data dependency removal.  However, it continued to use native x86 execution and ordinary microcode only, like Centaur's Winchip, unlike competitors Intel and AMD which introduced the method of dynamic translation to micro-operations with Pentium Pro and K5.  The 6x86 is socket-compatible with the Intel P54C Pentium, and was offered in six performance levels: PR 90+, PR 120+, PR 133+, PR 150+, PR 166+ and PR 200+. 

Colon classification<====>6888<====>Colon classificationColon classification (CC) is a system of library classification developed by S.  R.  Ranganathan.  It was the first ever faceted (or analytico-synthetic) classification.  The first edition was published in 1933.  Since then six more editions have been published.  It is especially used in libraries in India. Its name "colon classification" comes from the use of colons to separate facets in class numbers.  However, many other classification schemes, some of which are completely unrelated, also use colons and other punctuation in various functions. In CC, facets describe "personality" (the most specific subject), matter, energy, space, and time (PMEST). 

Census<====>6889<====>CensusA census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population.  The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses.  The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as "individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years.  United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. 

Outline of chemistry<====>6896<====>Outline of chemistry  The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to chemistry:Chemistry – science of atomic matter (matter that is composed of chemical elements), especially its chemical reactions, but also including its properties, structure, composition, behavior, and changes as they relate the chemical reactions. Chemistry is centrally concerned with atoms and their interactions with other atoms, and particularly with the properties of chemical bonds.  Summary of chemistryChemistry can be described as all of the following:An academic discipline  – one with academic departments, curricula and degrees; national and international societies; and specialized journals. 

Outline of critical theory<====>6901<====>Outline of critical theory The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to critical theory:Critical theory – the examination and critique of society and culture, drawing from knowledge across the social sciences and humanities. The term has two different meanings with different origins and histories: one originating in sociology and the other in literary criticism. This has led to the very literal use of 'critical theory' as an umbrella term to describe any theory founded upon critique.

Cotswolds<====>6902<====>CotswoldsThe Cotswolds is an area in south central England containing the Cotswold Hills, a range of rolling hills which rise from the meadows of the upper Thames to an escarpment, known as the Cotswold Edge, above the Severn Valley and Evesham Vale.  The area is defined by the bedrock of Jurassic limestone that creates a type of grassland habitat rare in the UK and that is quarried for the golden coloured Cotswold stone.   It contains unique features derived from the use of this mineral; the predominantly rural landscape contains stone-built villages, historical towns and stately homes and gardens. 

A.C. ChievoVerona<====>6903<====>A. C.  ChievoVerona   Associazione Calcio ChievoVerona (more commonly known as ChievoVerona or simply Chievo  ) is an Italian professional football club named after and based in Chievo, a suburb of 4,500 inhabitants in Verona, Veneto, and owned by Paluani, a bakery product company and the inspiration for their original name, Paluani Chievo.  The club shares the 38,402 seater Marc'Antonio Bentegodi stadium with its cross-town rivals Hellas Verona. HistoryEarly yearsThe team was founded in 1929 by a small number of football fans from the small borough of Chievo, a Verona neighbourhood.  Initially the club was not officially affiliated to the Italian Football Federation (FIGC), but nonetheless played several amateur tournament and friendly matches under the denomination "O. 

Context switch<====>6904<====>Context switch   In computing, a context switch is the process of storing the state of a process or of a thread, so that it can be restored and execution resumed from the same point later.   This allows multiple processes to share a single CPU, and is an essential feature of a multitasking operating system. The precise meaning of the phrase “context switch” varies significantly in usage.   In a multitasking context, it refers to the process of storing the system state for one task, so that that task can be paused and another task resumed. 

Carnatic<====>6905<====>CarnaticCarnatic usually refers to:Carnatic region, Southern IndiaCarnatic music, the classical music of Southern IndiaIt may also refer to:Carnatic Wars, a series of military conflicts in India during the 18th century , a Bangor class minesweeper of the Royal Indian Navy, that served in World War II , a 74-gun third rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched at Deptford in 1783 , a 74-gun third rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched at Portsmouth Dockyard in 1823SS Carnatic, a P&O steamer with an early compound engine  

Chakra<====>6907<====>Chakra    Chakra (IAST: C̣akra, meaning "wheel, circle"), sometimes spelled Cakra or Cakka, is any center of subtle body believed to be a psychic-energy center in the esoteric traditions of Indian religions.  Chakra: Religion, Encyclopaedia BritannicaThe concept is found particularly in the tantric traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.  They are conceived as an energy focal point, bodily functions or psychic node in the subtle body.  The Chakra theories are an elaborate part of the Kundalini system.These theories differ between the Indian religions, with esoteric Buddhist literature mentioning four Chakras, while esoteric Hindu texts stating seven. 

Cloning<====>6910<====>Cloning  In biology, cloning is the process of producing similar populations of genetically identical individuals that occurs in nature when organisms such as bacteria, insects,plants or animals reproduce asexually.  Cloning in biotechnology refers to processes used to create copies of DNA fragments (molecular cloning), cells (cell cloning), or organisms (organism cloning).  The term also refers to the production of multiple copies of a product such as digital media or software. The term clone, invented by J.  B.  S.  Haldane, is derived from the Ancient Greek word   klōn, "twig", referring to the process whereby a new plant can be created from a twig. 

Cellulose<====>6911<====>Cellulose Cellulose is an organic compound with the formula  , a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to many thousands of β(1→4) linked  D -glucose units. Cellulose is an important structural component of the primary cell wall of green plants, many forms of algae and the oomycetes.  Some species of bacteria secrete it to form biofilms.   Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on Earth. The cellulose content of cotton fiber is 90%, that of wood is 40–50%, and that of dried hemp is approximately 57%.

Colony<====>6916<====>Colony In politics and history, a colony is a territory under the immediate political control of a state, distinct from the home territory of the sovereign.    For colonies in antiquity, city-states would often found their own colonies.  Some colonies were historically countries, while others were territories without definite statehood from their inception. The metropolitan state is the state that rules the colony.  In Ancient Greece, the city that founded a colony was known as the metropolis.  "Mother country" is a reference to the metropolitan state from the point of view of citizens who live in its colony. 

Rod (optics)<====>6918<====>Rod (optics) "Rods" (sometimes known as "skyfish", "air rods", or "solar entities") is a term used in cryptozoology, ufology, and outdoor photography to refer to elongated artifacts in the form of light-rods produced by cameras.  Videos of rod-shaped objects moving quickly through the air were claimed by some ufologists and cryptozoologists to be alien life forms, "extradimensional" creatures, or very small UFOs.  Subsequent experiments showed that these rods appear in film because of an optical illusion/collusion (especially in interlaced video recording),  and are typically traces of a flying insect's wingbeats.    Paranormal claimsVarious paranormal interpretations appeared in the popular culture, and one of the more outspoken proponents of rods as alien life forms is Jose Escamilla, who claims to have been the first to film them on March 19, 1994 at Roswell, New Mexico, while attempting to film a UFO. 

Column<====>6920<====>Column   A column or pillar in architecture and structural engineering is a structural element that transmits, through compression, the weight of the structure above to other structural elements below.  In other words, a column is a compression member.  The term column applies especially to a large round support (the shaft of the column) with a capital and a base or pedestal  and made of stone, or appearing to be so.  A small wooden or metal support is typically called a post, and supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called piers. 

Carmilla<====>6921<====>Carmilla   Carmilla is a Gothic novella by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu and one of the early works of vampire fiction, predating Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897) by 26 years.  First published as a serial in The Dark Blue (1871–72), the story is narrated by a young woman preyed upon by a female vampire named Carmilla, later revealed to be Mircalla, Countess Karnstein (Carmilla is an anagram of Mircalla).  The story is often anthologized and has been adapted many times in film and other media. PublicationCarmilla, serialized in the literary magazine The Dark Blue in late 1871 and early 1872,  was reprinted in Le Fanu's short story collection In a Glass Darkly (1872). 

Clitoridectomy<====>6922<====>ClitoridectomyClitoridectomy or clitorectomy is the surgical removal, reduction, or partial removal of the clitoris. It is rarely used as a therapeutic medical procedure, such as when cancer has developed in or spread to the clitoris.  It is often performed on intersex newborns.  Commonly, non-medical removal of the clitoris is performed during female genital mutilation (FGM).    Medical usesMalignanciesA clitoridectomy is often done to remove malignancy or necrosis of the clitoris.  This is sometimes done along with a radical complete vulvectomy.  Surgery may also become necessary due to therapeutic radiation treatments to the pelvic area. 

Cabal<====>6924<====>Cabal  A cabal is a group of people united in some close design together, usually to promote their private views or interests in an ideology, state, or other community, often by intrigue, usually unbeknown to persons outside their group.  The use of this term usually carries strong connotations of shadowy corners, back rooms and insidious influence.  The term is frequently used in conspiracy theories. Origins of the wordThe term cabal derives from Cabala (a word that has numerous spelling variations), the Jewish mystical interpretation of the Hebrew scripture.  In Hebrew it means "reception" or "tradition", denoting the sod (secret) level of Jewish exegesis. 

Cytochrome<====>6925<====>CytochromeCytochromes are iron containing hemeproteins central to which are heme groups that are primarily responsible for the generation of ATP via electron transport.  They are found either as monomeric proteins (e. g. , cytochrome c) or as subunits of larger enzymatic complexes that catalyze redox reactions.  HistoryCytochromes were initially described in 1884 by MacMunn as respiratory pigments (myohematin or histohematin).In the 1920s, Keilin rediscovered these respiratory pigments and named them the cytochromes, or “cellular pigments”, and classified these heme proteins, on the basis of the position of their lowest energy absorption band in the reduced state, ascytochromes a (605 nm), b (~565 nm), and c (550 nm). 

Crowded House<====>6927<====>Crowded House  Crowded House were a rock  band formed in Melbourne, Australia, in 1985.  The founding members were  New Zealander Neil Finn (vocalist, guitarist, primary songwriter) and Australians Paul Hester (drums) and Nick Seymour (bass).  Later band members included Neil Finn's brother, Tim Finn, and Americans Mark Hart and Matt Sherrod.  McFarlane (1999)  "Neil Finn and Nick Seymour" Australian Broadcasting Corporation – 16 July 2007 Originally active from 1985 to 1996, the band had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand   (NOTE: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charts from 1974 until ARIA created their own charts in mid-1988. 

Colette<====>6928<====>Colette   Colette ( ; Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette, 28 January 1873 – 3 August 1954) was a French novelist nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1948.   Her best known work, the novella Gigi (1944), was the basis for the film and Lerner and Loewe stage production of the same name.  She was also a mime, an actress and a journalist. Life and careerFamily and backgroundSidonie-Gabrielle Colette was born on January 28, 1873, to war hero and tax collector Jules-Joseph Colette and his wife Adèle Eugénie Sidonie ("Sido"), nėe Landoy, in the village of Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye in the département of Yonne, Burgundy. 

Charles Alston<====>6932<====>Charles Alston  Charles Henry Alston (November 28, 1907 – April 27, 1977) was an African-American painter, sculptor, illustrator, muralist and teacher who lived and worked in the New York City neighborhood of Harlem.  Alston was active in the Harlem Renaissance; Alston was the first African-American supervisor for the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project.  Alston designed and painted murals at the Harlem Hospital and the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Building.  In 1990 Alston's bust of Martin Luther King, Jr.  became the first image of an African American displayed at the White House. Personal lifeEarly lifeCharles Henry Alston was born on November 28, 1907, in Charlotte, North Carolina, to Reverend Primus Priss Alston and Anna Elizabeth Miller Alston, and was the youngest of five children. 

Chromatin<====>6933<====>ChromatinChromatin is a complex of macromolecules found in  cells, consisting of DNA, protein, and RNA.    The primary functions of chromatin are 1) to package DNA into a more compact, denser shape, 2) to reinforce the DNA macromolecule to allow mitosis, 3) to prevent DNA damage, and 4) to control gene expression and DNA replication.  The primary protein components of chromatin are histones that compact the DNA.  Chromatin is only found in eukaryotic cells (cells with defined nuclei).  Prokaryotic cells have a different organization of their DNA (the prokaryotic chromosome equivalent is called genophore and is localized within the nucleoid region). 

Condition number<====>6934<====>Condition numberIn the field of numerical analysis, the condition number of a function with respect to an argument measures how much the output value of the function can change for a small change in the input argument.  This is used to measure how sensitive a function is to changes or errors in the input, and how much error in the output results from an error in the input.  Very frequently, one is solving the inverse problem – given  f(x) = y,  one is solving for x, and thus the condition number of the (local) inverse must be used. 

Cheddar cheese<====>6936<====>Cheddar cheese   Cheddar cheese is a relatively hard, off-white (or orange if spices such as annatto are added), sometimes sharp-tasting (i. e. , bitter   ), natural cheese.  Originating in the English village of Cheddar in Somerset,    cheeses of this style are produced beyond this region and in several countries around the world. Cheddar is the most popular type of cheese in the UK, accounting for 51% of the country's £1. 9 billion annual cheese market.   It is the second-most popular cheese in the US (behind mozzarella), with an average annual consumption of   per capita. 

Classical order<====>6938<====>Classical order"An Order in architecture is a certain assemblage of parts subject to uniform established proportions, regulated by the office that each part has to perform".  Coming down to the present from Ancient Greek and Ancient Roman civilization, the Architectural Orders are the styles of classical architecture, each distinguished by its proportions and characteristic profiles and details, and most readily recognizable by the type of column employed.  The three orders of architecture—the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian—originated in Greece.  To these the Romans added, in practice if not in name, the Tuscan, which they made simpler than Doric, and the Composite, which was more ornamental than the Corinthian.

Catherine of Aragon<====>6942<====>Catherine of Aragon    Catherine of Aragon ( ), also spelled Katherine (16 December 1485 – 7 January 1536), was Queen of England from June 1509 until May 1533 as the first wife of King Henry VIII; she was previously Princess of Wales as the wife of Henry's elder brother Arthur. The daughter of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, Catherine was three years old when she was betrothed to Arthur, Prince of Wales, heir apparent to the English throne.  They married in 1501, but Arthur died five months later.  In 1507, she held the position of ambassador of the Aragonese Crown in England, the first female ambassador in European history. 

Cathode ray<====>6943<====>Cathode ray Cathode rays (also called an electron beam or e-beam) are streams of electrons observed in vacuum tubes.  If an evacuated glass tube is equipped with two electrodes and a voltage is applied, glass behind the positive electrode is observed to glow, due to electrons emitted from and traveling away from the cathode (the electrode connected to the negative terminal of the voltage supply).   They were first observed in 1869 by German physicist Johann Wilhelm Hittorf, and were named in 1876 by Eugen Goldstein Kathodenstrahlen, or cathode rays.    In 1897, British physicist J. 

Cathode<====>6944<====>Cathode A cathode is the electrode from which a conventional current leaves a polarized electrical device.  (This definition can be recalled by using the mnemonic CCD for cathode current departs. ) A conventional current describes the direction in which positive electronic charges move.   Electrons have a negative electrical charge, so the movement of electrons is opposite to that of the conventional current flow (consequently, the mnemonic cathode current departs also means that electrons flow into the device's cathode). Cathode polarity with respect to the anode can be positive or negative depending on how the device is being operated. 

Chrominance<====>6945<====>Chrominance Chrominance (chroma or C for short) is the signal used in video systems to convey the color information of the picture, separately from the accompanying luma signal (or Y for short).  Chrominance is usually represented as two color-difference components: U = B′ − Y′ (blue − luma) and V = R′ − Y′ (red − luma).   Each of these difference components may have scale factors and offsets applied to it, as specified by the applicable video standard.   In composite video signals, the U and V signals modulate a color subcarrier signal, and the result is referred to as the chrominance signal; the phase and amplitude of this modulated chrominance signal correspond approximately to the hue and saturation of the color. 

Campus<====>6947<====>Campus A campus is traditionally the land on which a college or university and related institutional buildings are situated.  Usually a college campus includes libraries, lecture halls, residence halls, student centers or dining halls, and park-like settings. A modern campus is a collection of buildings and grounds that belong to a given institution, either academic or non-academic.  Examples include the Googleplex and the Apple Campus. EtymologyThe word derives from a Latin word for "field" and was first used to describe the large field adjacent Nassau Hall of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1774.   The field separated Princeton from the small nearby town. 

Crossbow<====>6948<====>Crossbow A crossbow is a type of ranged weapon based on the bow and consisting of a horizontal bow-like assembly mounted on a frame which is handheld in a similar fashion to the stock of a gun.   It shoots arrow-like projectiles called bolts or quarrels.   The medieval crossbow was called by many names, most of which were derived from the word ballista, a torsion siege engine resembling a crossbow.  Historically, crossbows played a significant role in the warfare of East Asia and Medieval Europe.    The earliest crossbows in the world were invented in ancient China and caused a major shift in the role of projectile weaponry. 

Carbamazepine<====>6949<====>Carbamazepine  Carbamazepine (CBZ), sold under the tradename Tegretol among others, is a medication used primarily in the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain.It is not effective for absence seizures or myoclonic seizures.   It is used in schizophrenia along with other medications and as a second line agent in bipolar disorder.   Carbamazepine appears to work as well as phenytoin and valproate.    Common side effects include nausea and drowsiness.   Serious side effects may include skin rashes, decreased bone marrow function, suicidal thoughts, or confusion.   It should not be used in those with a history of bone marrow problems.

Chalcedonian Definition<====>6955<====>Chalcedonian Definition  The Chalcedonian Definition (also called the Chalcedonian Creed) was adopted at the Council of Chalcedon in A. D.  451.  Chalcedon was an early centre of Christianity located in Asia Minor (modern Turkey).  The Council was the fourth of the Ecumenical Councils that are accepted by Chalcedonian churches which include the Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, and most Protestant churches.  It was the first Council not to be recognised by any Oriental Orthodox church; these churches may be classified as non-Chalcedonian. The Definition defines that Christ is 'acknowledged in two natures', which 'come together into one person and one hypostasis'. 

Conservation law<====>6956<====>Conservation law In physics, a conservation law states that a particular measurable property of an isolated physical system does not change as the system evolves over time.  Exact conservation laws include conservation of energy, conservation of linear momentum, conservation of angular momentum, and conservation of electric charge.  There are also many approximate conservation laws, which apply to such quantities as mass, parity, lepton number, baryon number, strangeness, hypercharge, etc.   These quantities are conserved in certain classes of physics processes, but not in all. A local conservation law is usually expressed mathematically as a continuity equation, a partial differential equation which gives a relation between the amount of the quantity and the "transport" of that quantity. 

Car Talk<====>6960<====>Car Talk  Car Talk was a Peabody Award-winning radio talk show broadcast weekly on NPR stations and elsewhere.  Its subjects were automobiles and automotive repair, discussed often in a humorous way.  It was hosted by brothers Tom and Ray Magliozzi, known also as "Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers".   The show was produced from 1977 to October 2012, when the Magliozzi brothers retired.   Edited reruns (which are introduced as The Best of Car Talk) continued to be available for weekly airing on NPR's national schedule    up through September 30, 2017, though some NPR affiliates have continued to broadcast reruns. 

Council of Chalcedon<====>6962<====>Council of Chalcedon   The Council of Chalcedon (  or  )  was a church council held from October 8 to November 1, AD 451, at Chalcedon.  The Council is numbered as the fourth ecumenical council by the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and most Protestants.  A minority of Christians, subsequently known as Oriental Orthodoxy, do not agree with the council's teachings. Its most important achievement was to issue the Chalcedonian Definition, stating that Jesus is "perfect both in deity and in humanness; this selfsame one is also actually God and actually man. "  The Council's judgments and definitions regarding the divine marked a significant turning point in the Christological debates. 

Canadian football<====>6963<====>Canadian football   The first documented football match was a practice game played on November 9, 1861, at University College, University of Toronto (approximately   west of Queen's Park).  One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was Sir William Mulock, later Chancellor of the school. A football club was formed at the university soon afterward, although its rules of play at this stage are unclear.  The first written account of a game played was on October 15, 1862, on the Montreal Cricket Grounds.  It was between the First Battalion Grenadier Guards and the Second Battalion Scots Fusilier Guards resulting in a win by the Grenadier Guards 3 goals, 2 rouges to nothing. 

Chinese calendar<====>6966<====>Chinese calendar The traditional Chinese calendar is a lunisolar calendar which reckons years, months and days according to astronomical phenomena.   , the Chinese calendar is defined by GB/T 33661-2017 Calculation and promulgation of the Chinese calendar, which the Standardization Administration of China issued on May 12, 2017. The Chinese calendar governs traditional activities in China and in overseas-Chinese communities.  It depicts and lists the dates of traditional Chinese holidays, and guides Chinese people in selecting the most auspicious days for weddings, funerals, moving, or beginning a business. In the Chinese calendar the days begin and end at midnight. 

Customer relationship management<====>6968<====>Customer relationship management  Customer relationship management (CRM) is an approach to manage a company's interaction with current and potential customers.  It uses data analysis about customers' history with a company to improve business relationships with customers, specifically focusing on customer retention and ultimately driving sales growth.  One important aspect of the CRM approach is the systems of CRM that compile data from a range of different communication channels, including a company's website, telephone, email, live chat, marketing materials, and more recently, social media.   Through the CRM approach and the systems used to facilitate it, businesses learn more about their target audiences and how to best cater to their needs. 

Chuck-a-luck<====>6970<====>Chuck-a-luck    Chuck-a-luck, also known as birdcage, is a game of chance played with three dice.  It is derived from grand hazard and both can be considered a variant of sic bo, which is a popular casino game, although chuck-a-luck is more of a carnival game than a true casino game.  The game is sometimes used as a fundraiser for charity. RulesChuck-a-luck is played with three standard dice that are kept in a device shaped somewhat like an hourglass that resembles a wire-frame bird cage and pivots about its centre.  The dealer rotates the cage end over end, with the dice landing on the bottom. 

Chipmunk<====>6972<====>Chipmunk   Chipmunks are small, striped rodents of the family Sciuridae.  Chipmunks are found in North America, with the exception of the Siberian chipmunk which is found primarily in Asia. Taxonomy and systematicsChipmunks may be classified either as a single genus, Tamias ( ), or as three genera: Tamias, which includes the eastern chipmunk; Eutamias, which includes the Siberian chipmunk; and Neotamias, which includes the 23 remaining, mostly western, species.  These classifications are arbitrary, and most taxonomies over the twentieth century have placed the chipmunks in a single genus.  However, studies of mitochondrial DNA show that the divergence between each of the three chipmunk groups is comparable to the genetic dissimilarity between Marmota and Spermophilus. 

Computer music<====>6974<====>Computer music   Computer music is the application of computing technology in music composition, to help human composers create new music or to have computers independently create music, such as with algorithmic composition programs.  It includes the theory and application of new and existing computer software technologies and basic aspects of music, such as sound synthesis, digital signal processing, sound design, sonic diffusion, acoustics, and psychoacoustics.  The field of computer music can trace its roots back to the origins of electronic music, and the very first experiments and innovations with electronic instruments at the turn of the 20th century. 

Concept<====>6978<====>Concept Concepts are the fundamental building blocks of our thoughts and beliefs.  They play an important role in all aspects of cognition.   Concepts arise as abstractions or generalisations from experience; from the result of a transformation of existing ideas; or from innate properties.    A concept is   by all of its actual or potential instances, whether these are things in the real world or other ideas. Concepts are studied as components of human cognition in the cognitive science disciplines of linguistics, psychology and philosophy, where an ongoing debate asks whether all cognition must occur through concepts.

Colin Powell<====>6984<====>Colin PowellColin Luther Powell  ( ; born April 5, 1937)  is an American   and a retired four-star general in the United States Army.   Powell was born in Harlem as the son of Jamaican immigrants.  During his military career, Powell also served as National Security Advisor (1987–1989), as Commander of the U. S.  Army Forces Command (1989) and as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (1989–1993), holding the latter position during the Persian Gulf War.  Powell was the first, and so far the only, African American to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 

Chlorophyll<====>6985<====>Chlorophyll Chlorophyll (also chlorophyl) is any of several related green pigments found in cyanobacteria and the chloroplasts of algae and plants.   Its name is derived from the Greek words χλωρός, chloros ("green") and φύλλον, phyllon ("leaf").Chlorophyll is essential in photosynthesis, allowing plants to absorb energy from light. Chlorophylls absorb light most strongly in the blue portion of the electromagnetic spectrum as well as the red portion.   Conversely, it is a poor absorber of green and near-green portions of the spectrum, which it reflects, producing the green color of chlorophyll-containing tissues.  Two types of chlorophyll exist in the photosystems of green plants: chlorophyll a and b. 

Carotene<====>6986<====>Carotene  The term carotene (also carotin, from the Latin carota, "carrot"    ) is used for many related unsaturated hydrocarbon substances having the formula C 40 H x , which are synthesized by plants but in general cannot be made by animals (with the exception of some aphids and spider mites which acquired the synthesizing genes from fungi).   Carotenes are photosynthetic pigments important for photosynthesis.  Carotenes contain no oxygen atoms.  They absorb ultraviolet, violet, and blue light and scatter orange or red light, and (in low concentrations) yellow light. Carotenes are responsible for the orange colour of the carrot, for which this class of chemicals is named, and for the colours of many other fruits, vegetables and fungi (for example, sweet potatoes, chanterelle and orange cantaloupe melon). 

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate<====>6988<====>Cyclic adenosine monophosphate Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP, cyclic AMP, or 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate) is a second messenger important in many biological processes.  cAMP is a derivative of  adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and used for intracellular signal transduction in many different organisms, conveying the cAMP-dependent pathway.   It should not be confused with 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP-activated protein kinase). HistoryEarl Sutherland of Vanderbilt University won a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1971 "for his discoveries concerning the mechanisms of the action of hormones", especially epinephrine, via second messengers (such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cyclic AMP). SynthesisCyclic AMP is synthesized from ATP by adenylate cyclase located on the inner side of the plasma membrane and anchored at various locations in the interior of the cell. 

Cimabue<====>6991<====>CimabueCimabue ( ;  ;   1240 – 1302), Vasari, G.  Lives of the Artists.  Translated with an introduction and notes by J. C.  and P Bondanella.  Oxford: Oxford University Press (Oxford World’s Classics), 1991, pp.  7–14.   .   also known as Cenni di Pepo    or Cenni di Pepi,  was an Italian painter and designer of mosaics from Florence. Although heavily influenced by Byzantine models, Cimabue is generally regarded as one of the first great Italian painters to break from the Italo-Byzantine style.   While medieval art then was scenes and forms that appeared relatively flat and highly stylized, Cimabue's figures were depicted with more-advanced lifelike proportions and shading than other artists of his time. 

Corporatocracy<====>6997<====>Corporatocracy    Corporatocracy  , a portmanteau of corporate and -ocracy (form of government), is a recent term used to refer to an economic and political system controlled by corporations or corporate interests.It is most often used today as a term to describe the current economic situation in a particular country, especially the United States.   This is different from corporatism, which is the organisation of society into groups with common interests.  Corporatocracy as a term is often used by observers across the political spectrum.   Economist Jeffrey Sachs described the United States as a corporatocracy in The Price of Civilization (2011). 

Culture of Canada<====>6999<====>Culture of Canada   The culture of Canada is a term that embodies the artistic, culinary, literary, humour, musical, political and social elements that are representative of Canada and Canadians.  Throughout Canada's history, its culture has been influenced by European culture and traditions, especially British and French, and by its own indigenous cultures.Over time, elements of the cultures of Canada's immigrant populations have become incorporated into mainstream Canadian culture. The population has also been influenced by American culture because of a shared language, proximity, television and migration between the two countries. 

List of companies of Canada<====>7000<====>List of companies of CanadaCanada is a country in the northern part of North America. Canada is the world's tenth-largest economy  , with a nominal GDP of approximately US$1. 52 trillion.It is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Group of Eight (G8), and is one of the world's top ten trading nations, with a highly globalized economy.    Canada is a mixed economy, ranking above the US and most western European nations on The Heritage Foundation's index of economic freedom,  and experiencing a relatively low level of income disparity. 

Cauchy distribution<====>7003<====>Cauchy distribution  The Cauchy distribution, named after Augustin Cauchy, is a continuous probability distribution.   It is also known, especially among physicists, as the Lorentz distribution (after Hendrik Lorentz), Cauchy–Lorentz distribution, Lorentz(ian) function, or Breit–Wigner distribution.   The Cauchy distribution  f(x; x_0,\gamma)  is the distribution of the x-intercept of a ray issuing from  (x_0,\gamma)  with a uniformly distributed angle.   It is also the distribution of the ratio of two independent normally distributed random variables if the denominator distribution has mean zero. The Cauchy distribution is often used in statistics as the canonical example of a "pathological" distribution since both its expected value and its variance are undefined. 

Control engineering<====>7011<====>Control engineeringControl engineering or control systems engineering  is an engineering discipline that applies automatic control theory to design systems with desired behaviors in control environments.The discipline of controls overlaps and is usually taught along with electrical engineering at many institutions around the world.  The practice uses sensors and detectors to measure the output performance of the process being controlled; these measurements are used to provide corrective feedback helping to achieve the desired performance.  Systems designed to perform without requiring human input are called automatic control systems (such as cruise control for regulating the speed of a car). 

Chagas disease<====>7012<====>Chagas disease  Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the protist Trypanosoma cruzi.   It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae, or "kissing bugs".   The symptoms change over the course of the infection.  In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite.   After 8–12 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 60–70% it never produces further symptoms. 

Christiaan Barnard<====>7015<====>Christiaan Barnard    Christiaan Neethling Barnard (8 November 1922 – 2 September 2001) was a South African cardiac surgeon who performed the world's first human-to-human heart transplant on 3 December 1967.Growing up in Beaufort West, Cape Province, he studied medicine and practised for several years in his native country.    As a young doctor experimenting on dogs, Barnard developed a remedy for the infant defect of intestinal atresia.   His technique saved the lives of ten babies in Cape Town and was adopted by surgeons in Britain and the United States. 

Concubinage<====>7016<====>Concubinage  Concubinage is an interpersonal and sexual relationship in which the couple are not or cannot be married.  The inability to marry may be due to multiple factors such as differences in social rank status, an existing marriage, religious prohibitions, professional ones (for example Roman soldiers) or a lack of recognition by appropriate authorities.  The woman in such a relationship is referred to as a concubine. The prevalence of concubinage and the status of rights and expectations of a concubine have varied among cultures, as have the rights of children of a concubine.  Whatever the status and rights of the concubine, they were always inferior to those of the wife, and typically neither she nor her children had rights of inheritance. 

Central Plaza (Hong Kong)<====>7017<====>Central Plaza (Hong Kong)  Central Plaza is a 78-storey,   skyscraper completed in August 1992 at 18 Harbour Road, in Wan Chai on Hong Kong Island in Hong Kong.  It is the third tallest tower in the city after 2 International Finance Centre in Central and the ICC in West Kowloon.  It was the tallest building in Asia from 1992 to 1996, until the Shun Hing Square in neighbouring Shenzhen was built.  Central Plaza surpassed the Bank of China Tower as the tallest building in Hong Kong until the completion of 2 IFC. Central Plaza was also the tallest reinforced concrete building in the world, until it was surpassed by CITIC Plaza, Guangzhou. 

Caravaggio<====>7018<====>Caravaggio  Michelangelo Merisi (Michele Angelo Merigi or Amerighi) da Caravaggio ( ,  ;  ; 28 September 1571  – 18 July 1610) was an Italian painter active in Rome, Naples, Malta, and Sicily from the early 1590s to 1610.  His paintings combine a realistic observation of the human state, both physical and emotional, with a dramatic use of lighting, and they had a formative influence on Baroque painting.    Caravaggio employed close physical observation with a dramatic use of chiaroscuro that came to be known as tenebrism.  He made the technique a dominant stylistic element, darkening shadows and transfixing subjects in bright shafts of light. 

Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin<====>7019<====>Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin ( ; 2 November 1699 – 6 December 1779) was an 18th-century French painter.  He is considered a master of still life,  and is also noted for his genre paintings which depict kitchen maids, children, and domestic activities.   Carefully balanced composition, soft diffusion of light, and granular impasto characterize his work. LifeChardin was born in Paris, the son of a cabinetmaker, and rarely left the city.  He lived on the Left Bank near Saint-Sulpice until 1757, when Louis XV granted him a studio and living quarters in the Louvre.  Chardin entered into a marriage contract with Marguerite Saintard in 1723, whom he did not marry until 1731. 

Crookes radiometer<====>7021<====>Crookes radiometer  The Crookes radiometer, also known as a light mill, consists of an airtight glass bulb, containing a partial vacuum.  Inside are a set of vanes which are mounted on a spindle.  The vanes rotate when exposed to light, with faster rotation for more intense light, providing a quantitative measurement of electromagnetic radiation intensity.  The reason for the rotation was a cause of much scientific debate in the ten years following the invention of the device,   but in 1879 the currently accepted explanation for the rotation was published.   Today the device is mainly used in physics education as a demonstration of a heat engine run by light energy. 

Cold Chisel<====>7022<====>Cold ChiselCold Chisel are   an Australian rock band that formed in Adelaide, Australia.  They had chart success in the 70s, 80s and 90s, and again more recently since reforming in 2011, with nine albums making the Australian top ten.   Cold Chisel are regarded as having a distinctly Australian popularity and musicianship, exemplifying "pub rock" and highlighting the working class life in Australia. Beginnings (1973–1978)Originally named Orange, the band formed in Adelaide in 1973 as a heavy-metal cover-band comprising keyboardist Ted Broniecki and bassist Les Kaczmarek (died December 5, 2008),  keyboard player Don Walker, guitarist Ian Moss and drummer Steve Prestwich (died 16 January 2011). 

Confederate States of America<====>7023<====>Confederate States of America  The Confederate States of America (CSA or C. S. ), commonly referred to as the Confederacy, was an unrecognized country in North America that existed from 1861 to 1865.  The Confederacy was originally formed by seven secessionist slave-holding states – South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas – in the Lower South region  whose regional economy was heavily dependent upon agriculture, particularly cotton, and a plantation system that relied upon the labor of African-American slaves.  Each state declared its secession from the United States following the November 1860 election of Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln to the U. 

Cranberry<====>7025<====>Cranberry    Cranberries are a group of evergreen dwarf shrubs or trailing vines in the subgenus Oxycoccus of the genus Vaccinium.  In Britain, cranberry may refer to the native species Vaccinium oxycoccos,  while in North America, cranberry may refer to Vaccinium macrocarpon.Vaccinium oxycoccos is cultivated in central and northern Europe, while Vaccinium macrocarpon is cultivated throughout the northern United States, Canada and Chile.   In some methods of classification, Oxycoccus is regarded as a genus in its own right.   They can be found in acidic bogs throughout the cooler regions of the Northern Hemisphere. 

Code coverage<====>7030<====>Code coverage In computer science, test coverage is a measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite runs.  A program with high test coverage, measured as a percentage, has had more of its source code executed during testing which suggests it has a lower chance of containing undetected software bugs compared to a program with low test coverage.   Many different metrics can be used to calculate test coverage; some of the most basic are the percentage of program subroutines and the percentage of program statements called during execution of the test suite. 

Caitlin Clarke<====>7033<====>Caitlin Clarke Caitlin Clarke (May 3, 1952 – September 9, 2004) was an American theater and film actress best known for her role as Valerian in the 1981 fantasy film Dragonslayer and for her role as Charlotte Cardoza in the 1998–1999 Broadway musical Titanic. BiographyClarke was born Katherine Anne Clarke in Pittsburgh, the oldest of five sisters, the youngest of whom is Victoria Clarke.   Her family moved to Sewickley when she was ten. Clarke received her B. A.  in theater arts from Mount Holyoke College in 1974 and her M. F. A.  from the Yale School of Drama in 1978. 

Cruiser<====>7034<====>Cruiser  A cruiser is a type of warship.   The term has been in use for several hundred years, and has had different meanings throughout this period.  During the Age of Sail, the term cruising referred to certain kinds of missions – independent scouting, commerce protection, or raiding – fulfilled by a frigate or sloop, which were the cruising warships of a fleet.  Modern cruisers are generally the largest ships in a fleet after aircraft carriers, and can usually perform several roles. In the middle of the 19th century, cruiser came to be a classification for the ships intended for cruising distant waters, commerce raiding, and scouting for the battle fleet. 

Chlamydia infection<====>7037<====>Chlamydia infection    Chlamydia infection, often simply known as chlamydia, is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis.   Most people who are infected have no symptoms.   When symptoms do develop this can take a few weeks following infection to occur.   Symptoms in women may include vaginal discharge or burning with urination.   Symptoms in men may include discharge from the penis, burning with urination, or pain and swelling of one or both testicles.   The infection can spread to the upper genital tract in women causing pelvic inflammatory disease which may result in future infertility or ectopic pregnancy. 

Candidiasis<====>7038<====>Candidiasis   Candidiasis is a fungal infection due to any type of Candida (a type of yeast).When it affects the mouth, it is commonly called thrush.   Signs and symptoms include white patches on the tongue or other areas of the mouth and throat.Other symptoms may include soreness and problems swallowing.   When it affects the vagina, it is commonly called a yeast infection.   Signs and symptoms include genital itching, burning, and sometimes a white "cottage cheese-like" discharge from the vagina.   Less commonly the penis may be affected, resulting in itchiness. 

Control theory<====>7039<====>Control theory  Control theory in control systems engineering deals with the control of continuously operating dynamical systems  in engineered processes and machines.  The objective is to develop a control model for controlling such systems using a control action in an optimum manner without delay or overshoot and ensuring control stability. To do this, a controller with the requisite corrective behaviour is required.  This controller monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares it with the reference or set point (SP).  The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the error signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point. 

Cracking joints<====>7042<====>Cracking joints  The act of cracking joints means bending a person's joints to produce a distinct cracking or popping sound, often followed by a feeling of satisfaction or relaxation to the person.  It is sometimes done as part of a joint adjustment/mobilization routinely performed by a chiropractor, osteopath or physical therapist. According to traditional belief, the popping of joints, especially knuckles, can lead to arthritis and other joint problems.  However, medical research has so far failed to conclusively demonstrate a connection between knuckle cracking and long-term joint problems.  While the cracking mechanism and the resulting sound is not yet fully understood, it is mainly attributed to nitrogen or carbon dioxide bubbles building up between the joints. 

Chemical formula<====>7043<====>Chemical formula   A chemical formula is a way of expressing information about the proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound or molecule, using a single line of chemical element symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, commas and plus (+) and minus (−) signs.  These are limited to a single typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts.  A chemical formula is not a chemical name, and it contains no words.  Although a chemical formula may imply certain simple chemical structures, it is not the same as a full chemical structural formula. 

Beetle<====>7044<====>Beetle    Beetles are a group of insects that form the order Coleoptera, in the superorder Endopterygota.  Their front pair of wings is hardened into wing-cases, elytra, distinguishing them from most other insects.  The Coleoptera, with about 400,000 species, is the largest of all orders, constituting almost 40% of described insects and 25% of all known animal life-forms; new species are discovered frequently.  The largest of all families, the Curculionidae (weevils) with some 70,000 member species, belongs to this order.  They are found in almost every habitat except the sea and the polar regions. 

Concorde<====>7045<====>Concorde   Aérospatiale/BAC Concorde ( ) is  a British-French turbojet-powered supersonic passenger jet airliner that was operated until 2003.  It had a maximum speed over twice the speed of sound at Mach 2. 04 (  at cruise altitude), with seating for 92 to 128 passengers.  First flown in 1969, Concorde entered service in 1976 and continued flying for the next 27 years.  It is one of only two supersonic transports to have been operated commercially; the other is the Soviet-built Tupolev Tu-144, which operated in passenger service from 1977 Gordon and Rigmant 2005  to 1978. 

Cannon<====>7053<====>CannonA cannon (plural: cannon or cannons) is a type of gun classified as artillery that launches a projectile using propellant.  In the past, gunpowder was the primary propellant before the invention of smokeless powder in the 19th century.  Cannon vary in caliber, range, mobility, rate of fire, angle of fire, and firepower; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their intended use on the battlefield.  The word cannon is derived from several languages, in which the original definition can usually be translated as tube, cane, or reed. 

Computer mouse<====>7056<====>Computer mouse  A computer mouse is a hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface.  This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface.  The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was in 1968.   Originally wired to a computer, modern mice are often cordless, relying on short-range radio communication with the connected system.   Mice originally used a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion, but modern mice often have optical sensors that have no moving parts. 

Civil defense<====>7059<====>Civil defenseCivil defense, civil defence (see spelling differences) or civil protection is an effort to protect the citizens of a state (generally non-combatants) from military attacks and natural disasters.  It uses the principles of emergency operations: prevention, mitigation, preparation, response, or emergency evacuation and recovery.  Programs of this sort were initially discussed at least as early as the 1920s and were implemented in some countries during the 1930s as the threat of war and aerial bombardment grew.  It became widespread after the threat of nuclear weapons was realized. Since the end of the Cold War, the focus of civil defense has largely shifted from military attack to emergencies and disasters in general. 

Chymotrypsin<====>7060<====>Chymotrypsin   Chymotrypsin ( , chymotrypsins A and B, alpha-chymar ophth, avazyme, chymar, chymotest, enzeon, quimar, quimotrase, alpha-chymar, alpha-chymotrypsin A, alpha-chymotrypsin) is a digestive enzyme component of pancreatic juice acting in the duodenum, where it performs proteolysis, the breakdown of proteins and polypeptides.Chymotrypsin preferentially cleaves peptide amide bonds where the side chain of the amino acid N-terminal to the scissile amide bond (the P 1  position) is a large hydrophobic amino acid (tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine).  These amino acids contain an aromatic ring in their side chain that fits into a hydrophobic pocket (the S 1  position) of the enzyme. 

Community emergency response team<====>7061<====>Community emergency response team In the United States, a community emergency response team (CERT) can refer toone of five federal programs promoted under the umbrella organization Citizen Corps, which is funded in part by the Stafford Act;an implementation of the federal CERT program, administered by a local sponsoring agency, which receives Stafford grant funding, and provides standardized training and an implementation framework to community members;an organization of volunteer emergency workers who have received specific training in basic disaster response skills, and who agree to supplement existing emergency responders in the event of a major disaster. Sometimes programs and organizations take different names, such as Neighborhood Emergency Response Team (NERT), or Neighborhood Emergency Team (NET). 

Catapult<====>7063<====>Catapult   A catapult is a ballistic device used to launch a projectile a great distance without the aid of explosive devices—particularly various types of ancient and medieval siege engines.   In use since ancient times, the catapult has proven to be one of the most effective mechanisms during warfare.  In modern times the term can apply to devices ranging from a simple hand-held implement (also called a “slingshot”) to a mechanism for launching aircraft from a ship. EtymologyThe word 'catapult' comes from the Latin 'catapulta', which in turn comes from the Greek    (katapeltēs), itself from κατά (kata), "downwards"    and πάλλω (pallō), "to toss, to hurl". 

Cinquain<====>7066<====>CinquainCinquain   is a class of poetic forms that employ a 5-line pattern.   Earlier used to describe any five-line form, it now refers to one of several forms that are defined by specific rules and guidelines. American CinquainThe modern form, known as American Cinquain   inspired by Japanese haiku and tanka,  Toleos, Aaron.  Cinquains explained Retrieved 2010-06-11.   akin in spirit to that of the Imagists.  In her 1915 collection titled Verse, published one year after her death, Adelaide Crapsey included 28 cinquains.  Crapsey's American Cinquain form developed in two stages. 

Cook Islands<====>7067<====>Cook Islands    The Cook Islands ( ; Cook Islands Māori: Kūki 'Āirani)  is a self-governing island country in the South Pacific Ocean in free association with New Zealand.  It comprises 15 islands whose total land area is  .  The Cook Islands' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) covers   of ocean.  New Zealand is responsible for the Cook Islands' defence and foreign affairs, but they are exercised in consultation with the Cook Islands.  In recent times, the Cook Islands have adopted an increasingly independent foreign policy.  Although Cook Islanders are citizens of New Zealand, they have the status of Cook Islands nationals, which is not given to other New Zealand citizens. 

History of the Cook Islands<====>7068<====>History of the Cook IslandsThe Cook Islands are named after Captain James Cook, who visited the islands in 1773 and 1777.   The Cook Islands became a British protectorate in 1888. By 1900, the islands were annexed as British territory.  In 1901, the islands were included within the boundaries of the Colony of New Zealand. The Cook Islands contain 15 islands in the group spread over a vast area in the South Pacific.  The majority of islands are low coral atolls in the Northern Group, with Rarotonga, a volcanic island in the Southern Group, as the main administration and government centre.

A census is carried out every five years in the Cook Islands.  The last census was carried out in 2011 and the next census will be carried out in December 2016.  CIA World Factbook demographic statisticsThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.    Population9,838Age structure (2013 est. )0–14 years: 22. 15% (male 1,154/female 1,025)15–24 years: 17. 

Politics of the Cook Islands<====>7071<====>Politics of the Cook Islands The politics of the Cook Islands, an associated state, takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democracy within a constitutional monarchy.  The Queen of New Zealand, represented in the Cook Islands by the Queen's Representative, is the Head of State; the Prime Minister is the head of government and of a  multi-party system.  The Islands are self-governing in free association with New Zealand and are fully responsible for internal affairs.  New Zealand retains some responsibility for external affairs, in consultation with the Cook Islands.  In recent years, the Cook Islands have taken on more of its own external affairs; as of 2005, it has diplomatic relations in its own name with eighteen other countries. 

Economy of the Cook Islands<====>7072<====>Economy of the Cook IslandsThe economy of the Cook Islands, as in many other South Pacific nations, is hindered by the isolation of the country from foreign markets, lack of natural resources, periodic devastation from natural disasters, and inadequate infrastructure. Tourism provides the economic base with minor exports made up of tropical and citrus fruit.  Manufacturing activities are limited to fruit-processing, clothing, and handicrafts. Trade deficits are made up for by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid, overwhelmingly from New Zealand.  Efforts to exploit tourism potential, encourage offshore banking, and expand the mining and fishing industries have been partially successful in stimulating investment and growth. 

Telecommunications in the Cook Islands<====>7073<====>Telecommunications in the Cook Islands  Like most countries and territories in Oceania, telecommunications in the Cook Islands is limited by its isolation and low population,  with only one major television broadcasting station and six radio stations.  However, most residents have a main line or mobile phone.  Its telecommunications are mainly provided by Telecom Cook Islands, who is currently working with O3b Networks, Ltd.  for faster Internet connection. TelephoneIn July 2012, there were about 7,500 main line telephones, which covers about 98% of the country's population,    while there were approximately 7,800 mobile phones in 2009.

Computer file<====>7077<====>Computer file  A computer file is a computer resource for recording data discretely in a computer storage device.  Just as words can be written to paper, so can information be written to a computer file. There are different types of computer files, designed for different purposes.  A file may be designed to store a picture, a written message, a video, a computer program, or a wide variety of other kinds of data.  Some types of files can store several types of information at once. By using computer programs, a person can open, read, change, and close a computer file. 

Christian Doppler<====>7080<====>Christian Doppler Christian Andreas Doppler ( ;  ; 29 November 1803 – 17 March 1853)  was an Austrian mathematician and physicist.  He is celebrated for his principle — known as the Doppler effect — that the observed frequency of a wave depends on the relative speed of the source and the observer.  He used this concept to explain the color of binary stars. BiographyChristian Doppler was born in Salzburg (today Austria) in 1803.  After completing high school, Doppler studied philosophy in Salzburg and mathematics and physics at the Imperial–Royal Polytechnic Institute (now Vienna University of Technology) where he began work as an assistant in 1829. 

Clerihew<====>7081<====>ClerihewA clerihew ( ) is a whimsical, four-line biographical poem invented by Edmund Clerihew Bentley.  The first line is the name of the poem's subject, usually a famous person put in an absurd light, or revealing something unknown or spurious about them.  The rhyme scheme is AABB, and the rhymes are often forced.   The line length and metre are irregular.  Bentley invented the clerihew in school and then popularized it in books.  One of his best known is this (1905): FormA clerihew has the following properties:It is biographical and usually whimsical, showing the subject from an unusual point of view; it mostly pokes fun at famous peopleIt has four lines of irregular length and metre for comic effectThe rhyme structure is AABB; the subject matter and wording are often humorously contrived in order to achieve a rhyme, including the use of phrases in Latin, French and other non-English languages The first line contains, and may consist solely of, the subject's name. 

Civil war<====>7085<====>Civil warA civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology,  is a war between organized groups within the same state or country. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies.  James Fearon, "Iraq's Civil War" in Foreign Affairs, March/April 2007.  For further discussion on civil war classification, see the section "Formal classification".  The term is a calque of the Latin bellum civile which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC.

Duke of Mantua Francesco I Gonzaga is the one who used the earliest example of homophonic Substitution cipher in early 1400s. 

Chocolate<====>7089<====>ChocolateChocolate   is a typically sweet, usually brown food preparation of Theobroma cacao seeds, roasted and ground.  It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods.  Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia in Mesoamerica.  The earliest evidence of use traces to the Olmecs (Mexico), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating back to 3000 BCE.   In fact, the majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs,  who made it into a beverage known as xocolātl  , a Nahuatl word meaning "bitter water". 

Cornet<====>7100<====>Cornet    The cornet ( ,   ) is a brass instrument similar to the trumpet but distinguished from it by its conical bore, more compact shape, and mellower tone quality.   The most common cornet is a transposing instrument in B , though there is also a soprano cornet in E .  Both are unrelated to the renaissance and early baroque cornett. HistoryThe cornet derived from the posthorn    by applying rotary valves to it in the 1820s in France.   By the 1830s, however, Parisian makers were using piston valves instead. 

Cotton Mather<====>7104<====>Cotton Mather  Cotton Mather, FRS (February 12, 1663 – February 13, 1728; A. B.  1678, Harvard College; A. M.  1681, honorary doctorate 1710, University of Glasgow) was a socially and politically influential New England Puritan minister, prolific author, and pamphleteer.  He left a scientific legacy due to his hybridization experiments and his promotion of inoculation for disease prevention, though he is most frequently remembered today for his vigorous support for the Salem witch trials.  He was subsequently denied the presidency of Harvard College which his father, Increase Mather, had held. Life and workMather was born in Boston, Massachusetts Bay Colony, the son of Maria (née Cotton) and Increase Mather, and grandson of both John Cotton and Richard Mather, all also prominent Puritan ministers. 

Cordwainer Smith<====>7105<====>Cordwainer Smith  Cordwainer Smith ( ,  )  was the pen-name used by American author Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger (July 11, 1913 – August 6, 1966) for his science fiction works.  Linebarger was a noted East Asia scholar and expert in psychological warfare.  ("Cordwainer" is an archaic word for "a worker in cordwain or cordovan leather; a shoemaker", Oxford English Dictionary  and a "smith" is "one who works in iron or other metals; esp.  a blacksmith or farrier":  two kinds of skilled workers with traditional materials. )Linebarger also employed the literary pseudonyms "Carmichael Smith" (for his political thriller Atomsk), "Anthony Bearden" (for his poetry) and "Felix C. 

Churnsike Lodge<====>7118<====>Churnsike Lodge Churnsike Lodge ( ) was an early Victorian hunting lodge situated in the parish of Greystead,  West Northumberland, England.  It was built in 1850 as a shooting lodge and was part of the Hesleyside estate (Hesleyside house is situated in the North Tyne valley near Bellingham).   When the estate was sold in 1889, Churnsike Lodge was purchased by the Chesters Estate (near Hexham, Northumberland).   The "cairnsyke" estate comprised several thousand acres of grouse moor and is referred to in the sale catalogue of 1889 as the "Finest grouse moor in the Kingdom". 

William Kidd<====>7119<====>William Kidd William Kidd, also Captain William Kidd or simply Captain Kidd (c. 1654 – 23 May 1701)  was a Scottish sailor who was tried and executed for piracy after returning from a voyage to the Indian Ocean.  Some modern historians, for example Sir Cornelius Neale Dalton (see Books), deem his piratical reputation unjust. BiographyEarly life and educationKidd was born in Dundee, Scotland, c.  1654, his father, Captain John Kyd, being lost at sea.  Kidd gave Greenock as his place of birth and his age as 41 in testimony under oath at the High Court of the Admiralty in October 1694 or 1695. 

Calreticulin<====>7120<====>Calreticulin  Calreticulin also known as  calregulin, CRP55, CaBP3, calsequestrin-like protein, and endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 60 (ERp60) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CALR gene.  Calreticulin is a multifunctional protein that binds Ca 2+  ions (a second messenger in signal transduction), rendering it inactive.  The Ca 2+  is bound with low affinity, but high capacity, and can be released on a signal (see inositol triphosphate).  Calreticulin is located in storage compartments associated with the endoplasmic reticulum.  The term "Mobilferrin"  is considered to be the same as calreticulin by some sources. 

Crannog<====>7122<====>CrannogA crannog  ( ;    ;    ) is typically a partially or entirely artificial island, usually built in lakes, rivers and estuarine waters of Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.  Unlike the prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps that were built on the shores and were inundated only later on, crannogs were built in the water, thus forming artificial islands. Crannogs were used as dwellings over five millennia, from the European Neolithic Period    to as late as the 17th/early 18th century,  although in Scotland there is currently no convincing evidence in the archaeological record of Early and Middle Bronze Age or Norse Period use. 

Calendar date<====>7123<====>Calendar date A calendar date is a reference to a particular day represented within a calendar system.  The calendar date allows the specific day to be identified.  The number of days between two dates may be calculated.  For example, "24 January 2018" is ten days after "14 January 2018" in the Gregorian calendar.  The date of a particular event depends on the observed time zone.  For example, the air attack on Pearl Harbor that began at 7:48 a. m.  Hawaiian time on December 7, 1941, took place at 3:18 a. m.  December 8 in Japan (Japan Standard Time). 

Cist<====>7124<====>Cist A cist (  or  ; also kist  ;  from   or Germanic Kiste) is a small stone-built coffin-like box or ossuary used to hold the bodies of the dead.  Examples can be found across Europe and in the Middle East.A cist may have been associated with other monuments, perhaps under a cairn or long barrow.  Several cists are sometimes found close together within the same cairn or barrow.  Often ornaments have been found within an excavated cist, indicating the wealth or prominence of the interred individual. 

Center (group theory)<====>7125<====>Center (group theory)In abstract algebra, the center of a group,  , is the set of elements that commute with every element of  .  It is denoted  , from German  , meaning center.  In set-builder notation, . The center is a normal subgroup,  .   As a subgroup, it is always characteristic, but is not necessarily fully characteristic.   The quotient group,  , is isomorphic to the inner automorphism group,  . A group   is abelian if and only if  .   At the other extreme, a group is said to be centerless if   is trivial; i. 

Commonwealth of England<====>7129<====>Commonwealth of England  The Commonwealth was the period from 1649 to 1660 when England and Wales, later along with Ireland and Scotland,  was ruled as a republic following the end of the Second English Civil War and the trial and execution of Charles I.   The republic's existence was declared through "An Act declaring England to be a Commonwealth",  adopted by the Rump Parliament on 19 May 1649.   Power in the early Commonwealth was vested primarily in the Parliament and a Council of State.  During the period, fighting continued, particularly in Ireland and Scotland, between the parliamentary forces and those opposed to them, as part of what is now referred to as the Third English Civil War. 

Charles Evers<====>7131<====>Charles Evers James Charles Evers (born September 11, 1922) is an American civil rights activist and former politician.  A Republican, Evers was known for his role in the Civil Rights Movement along with his younger brother Medgar Evers.   He was made the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) State Voter Registration Chairman in 1954.  After his brother's assassination in 1963, Evers took over his position as field director of the NAACP in Mississippi.  As field director, Evers organized and led many demonstrations for the rights of African Americans.  In 1969, Evers was named “Man of the Year” by the NAACP. 

Code-division multiple access<====>7143<====>Code-division multiple access  Code-division multiple access (CDMA) is a channel access method used by various radio communication technologies.    CDMA is an example of multiple access,  where several transmitters can send information simultaneously over a single communication channel.  This allows several users to share a band of frequencies (see bandwidth).  To permit this without undue interference between the users, CDMA employs spread spectrum technology and a special coding scheme (where each transmitter is assigned a code).  CDMA is used as the access method in many mobile phone standards.  IS-95, also called "cdmaOne", and its 3G evolution CDMA2000, are often simply referred to as "CDMA", but UMTS, the 3G standard used by GSM carriers, also uses "wideband CDMA", or W-CDMA, as well as TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA, as its radio technologies. 

Content-control software<====>7144<====>Content-control softwareContent-control software is software designed to restrict or control the content a reader is authorised to access, especially when utilised to restrict material delivered over the Internet via the Web, e-mail, or other means.  Content-control software determines what content will be available or be blocked. Such restrictions can be applied at various levels: a government can attempt to apply them nationwide (see Internet censorship), or they can, for example, be applied by an ISP to its clients, by an employer to its personnel, by a school to its students, by a library to its visitors, by a parent to a child's computer, or by an individual user to his or her own computer. 

Chambered cairn<====>7145<====>Chambered cairnA chambered cairn is a burial monument, usually constructed during the Neolithic, consisting of a sizeable (usually stone) chamber around and over which a cairn of stones was constructed.  Some chambered cairns are also passage-graves.  They are found throughout Britain and Ireland, with the largest number in Scotland. Typically, the chamber is larger than a cist, and will contain a larger number of interments, which are either excarnated bones or inhumations (cremations).  Most were situated near a settlement, and served as that community's "graveyard". ScotlandBackgroundDuring the early Neolithic (4000-3300 BC) architectural forms are highly regionalised with timber and earth monuments predominating in the east and stone-chambered cairns in the west.

Canadian whisky<====>7147<====>Canadian whisky Canadian whisky is a type of whisky produced in Canada.  Most Canadian whiskies are blended multi-grain liquors containing a large percentage of corn spirits, and are typically lighter and smoother than other whisky styles.  What is Canadian Whisky?, whisky. com.  (Access date December 15, 2010. )  When Canadian distillers began adding small amounts of highly-flavourful rye grain to their mashes, people began demanding this new rye-flavoured whisky, referring to it simply as "rye".  Today, as for the past two centuries, the terms "rye whisky" and "Canadian whisky" are used interchangeably in Canada and (as defined in Canadian law) refer to exactly the same product, which generally is made with only a small amount of rye grain. 

Collective noun<====>7148<====>Collective noun  In linguistics, a collective noun is a word that refers to a collection of things taken as a whole.  Most collective nouns in everyday speech are mundane and do not identify just one specific kind, such as the word "group", which may apply to "people" in the phrase "a group of people" but may also correctly refer to "dogs", in the phrase "a group of dogs".  Other collective nouns are specific to one kind, especially terms of venery, which are words for specific groups of animals.  For example, "pride" as a term of venery always refers to lions, never to dogs or cows. 

Carat (mass)<====>7158<====>Carat (mass)  The carat (ct) is a unit of mass equal to 200 mg (0. 2 g; 0. 007055 oz) and is used for measuring gemstones and pearls. The current definition, sometimes known as the metric carat, was adopted in 1907 at the Fourth General Conference on Weights and Measures,    and soon afterwards in many countries around the world.   The carat is divisible into one hundred points of two milligrams each.  Other subdivisions, and slightly different mass values, have been used in the past in different locations. In terms of diamonds, a paragon is a flawless stone of at least 100 carats (20 g). 

European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations<====>7160<====>European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations The European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) was established on June 26, 1959, as a coordinating body for European state telecommunications and postal organizations. The acronym comes from the French version of its name Conférence européenne des administrations des postes et des télécommunications.CEPT was responsible for the creation of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in 1988.CEPT is organised into three main components:Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) - responsible for radiocommunications and telecommunications matters and formed by the merger of ECTRA and ERC (European Radiocommunications Committee) in September 2001 The permanent secretariat of the ECC is the European Communications Office (ECO)European Committee for Postal Regulation (CERP, after the French "Comité européen des régulateurs postaux") - responsible for postal mattersThe Committee for ITU Policy (Com-ITU) is responsible for organising the co-ordination of CEPT actions for the preparation for and during the course of the ITU activities meetings of the Council, Plenipotentiary Conferences, World Telecommunication Development Conferences, World Telecommunication Standardisation AssembliesMember countriesAs of December 2016 : 49 countries.Albania, Andorra, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Kosovo, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malta, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom,  Vatican City,See alsoInternational Telecommunication UnionUniversal Postal UnionCEPT Recommendation T/CD 06-01 (standard for videotex)E-carrier (standard for multiplexed telephone circuits)WiMAXPMR446LPD433Asia-Pacific Telecommunity (APT)African Telecommunications Union (ATU)Inter-American Telecommunication Commission (CITEL)Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (E.

Tramlink<====>7162<====>TramlinkTramlink is a light rail tram system serving Croydon and surrounding areas in South London, England.  It began operation in 2000,  the first tram system in London since 1952.  It is owned by London Trams, an arm of Transport for London (TfL), and operated by FirstGroup. The network consists of 39 stops along   of track,  on a mixture of street track shared with other traffic, dedicated track in public roads, and off-street track consisting of new rights-of-way, former railway lines, and one right-of-way where the Tramlink track parallels a third rail-electrified Network Rail line. 

Catenary<====>7163<====>Catenary  In physics and geometry, a catenary ( ,  ) is the curve that an idealized hanging chain or cable assumes under its own weight when supported only at its ends. The catenary curve has a U-like shape, superficially similar in appearance to a parabolic arch, but it is not a parabola. The curve appears in the design of certain types of arches and  as a cross section of the catenoid—the shape assumed by a soap film bounded by two parallel circular rings. The catenary is also called the alysoid, chainette, MathWorld  or, particularly in the materials sciences, funicular. 

Color temperature<====>7164<====>Color temperature The color temperature of a light source is the temperature of an ideal black-body radiator that radiates light of a color comparable to that of the light source.  Color temperature is a characteristic of visible light that has important applications in lighting, photography, videography, publishing, manufacturing, astrophysics, horticulture, and other fields.  In practice, color temperature is meaningful only for light sources that do in fact correspond somewhat closely to the radiation of some black body, i. e. , those on a line from reddish/orange via yellow and more or less white to blueish white; it does not make sense to speak of the color temperature of, e. 

Cartoon<====>7165<====>CartoonA cartoon is a type of two-dimensional illustration, possibly animated.  While the specific definition has changed over time, modern usage refers to (a) a typically non-realistic or semi-realistic artistic style of drawing or painting, (b) an image or series of images intended for satire, caricature, or humor, or (c) a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation.  An artist who creates cartoons is called a cartoonist.  The concept originated in the Middle Ages and first described a preparatory drawing for a piece of art, such as a painting, fresco, tapestry, or stained glass window. 

Chief Minister of the Northern Territory<====>7167<====>Chief Minister of the Northern Territory   The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory is the head of government of the Northern Territory.  The office is the equivalent of a State Premier.   When the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly was created in 1974, the head of government was officially known as Majority Leader.  This title was used in the first parliament (1974–1977) and the first eighteen months of the second.  When self-government was granted the Northern Territory in 1978, the title of the head of government became Chief Minister. The Chief Minister is formally appointed by the Administrator, who in normal circumstances will appoint the head of whichever party holds the majority of seats in the unicameral Legislative Assembly. 

Chemotherapy<====>7172<====>Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy (often abbreviated to chemo and sometimes CTX or CTx) is a category of cancer treatment that uses one or more anti-cancer drugs (chemotherapeutic agents) as part of a standardized chemotherapy regimen.  Chemotherapy may be given with a curative intent (which almost always involves combinations of drugs), or it may aim to prolong life or to reduce symptoms (palliative chemotherapy).  Chemotherapy is one of the major categories of the medical discipline specifically devoted to pharmacotherapy for cancer, which is called medical oncology. The term chemotherapy has come to connote non-specific usage of intracellular poisons to inhibit mitosis, or cell division. 

Chinese historiography<====>7174<====>Chinese historiography Chinese historiography is the study of the techniques and sources used by historians to develop the recorded history of China. Overview of Chinese historyThe recording of Chinese history dates back to the Shang dynasty (c.  1600–1046 BC).  Although they are not literature as such, many written examples survive of ceremonial inscriptions, divinations and records of family names, which were carved or painted onto tortoise shell or bones.  William G.  Boltz, Early Chinese Writing, World Archaeology, Vol.  17, No.  3, Early Writing Systems.  (Feb. , 1986), pp.  420–436 (436).   The oldest surviving history texts of China were compiled in the Shujing (Book of Documents, 書經). 

Communist Party of China<====>7175<====>Communist Party of ChinaThe Communist Party of China (CPC)   is the founding and ruling political party of the People's Republic of China.  The Communist Party of China is the sole governing party of China, permitting only eight other, subordinated parties to co-exist, those making up the United Front.  It was founded in 1921, chiefly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao.  The party grew quickly, and by 1949 the CPC had driven the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) government from mainland China after the Chinese Civil War, thus leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China. 

Cryogenics<====>7176<====>Cryogenics  In physics, cryogenics is the study of the production and behaviour of materials at very low temperatures. It is not well-defined at what point on the temperature scale refrigeration ends and cryogenics begins, but scientists    assume a gas to be cryogenic if it can be liquefied at or below  .  The U. S.  National Institute of Standards and Technology has chosen to consider the field of cryogenics as that involving temperatures below  .  This is a logical dividing line, since the normal boiling points of the so-called permanent gases (such as helium, hydrogen, neon, nitrogen, oxygen, and normal air) lie below −180 °C while the Freon refrigerants, hydrocarbon s, and other common refrigerants have boiling points above −180 °C.

Guest is most widely known in Hollywood for having written, directed and starred in his series of comedy films shot in mock-documentary (mockumentary) style.  Many scenes and character backgrounds in Guest's films are written and directed, although actors have no rehearsal time and the ensemble improvise scenes while filming them.  The series of films began with This Is Spinal Tap (directed by Rob Reiner), and continued with Waiting for Guffman, Best In Show, A Mighty Wind,  For Your Consideration, and Mascots. 

Carol Kane<====>7183<====>Carol Kane   Carolyn Laurie Kane (born June 18, 1952)  is an American stage, screen and television actress and comedian.

She appeared on the television series Taxi in the early 1980s, as the wife of Latka, the character played by Andy Kaufman, winning two Emmy Awards for her work.  She has played the character of Madame Morrible in the musical Wicked, both in regional productions and on Broadway from 2005 to 2014. 

C*-algebra<====>7184<====>C*-algebra C ∗ -algebras  (pronounced "C-star") are an area of research in functional analysis, a branch of mathematics.   A C*-algebra is a complex algebra A of continuous linear operators on a complex Hilbert space with two additional properties:A is a topologically closed set in the norm topology of operators. A is closed under the operation of taking adjoints of operators. C*-algebras were first considered primarily for their use in quantum mechanics to model algebras of physical observables.   This line of research began with Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics and in a more mathematically developed form with Pascual Jordan around 1933. 

London Borough of Croydon<====>7185<====>London Borough of Croydon    The London Borough of Croydon ( ) is a London borough in south London, England and is part of Outer London.  It covers an area of   and is the second largest London borough by population.  It is the southernmost borough of London.At its centre is the historic town of Croydon from which the borough takes its name.  Croydon is mentioned in Domesday Book, and from a small market town has expanded into one of the most populous areas on the fringe of London. 

Carme (moon)<====>7188<====>Carme (moon) Carme (   ;  ) is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter.  It was discovered by Seth Barnes Nicholson at Mount Wilson Observatory in California in July 1938.   It is named after the mythological Carme, mother by Zeus of Britomartis, a Cretan goddess. HistoryCarme did not receive its present name until 1975;  before then, it was simply known as  .  It was sometimes called "Pan"    between 1955 and 1975 (Pan is now the name of a satellite of Saturn). It gives its name to the Carme group, made up of irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23 and 24 Gm and at an inclination of about 165°. 

Commutator<====>7193<====>Commutator In mathematics, the commutator gives an indication of the extent to which a certain binary operation fails to be commutative.  There are different definitions used in group theory and ring theory. Group theoryThe commutator of two elements,   and  , of a group  , is the element . It is equal to the group's identity if and only if   and   commute (i. e. , if and only if  ).  The subgroup of G generated by all commutators is called the derived group or the commutator subgroup of G.  Note that one must consider the subgroup generated by the set of commutators because in general the set of commutators is not closed under the group operation. 

Cairn<====>7196<====>Cairn  A cairn is a human-made pile (or stack) of stones.  The word cairn comes from the(plural    ).  Cairns have been and are used for a broad variety of purposes, from prehistoric times to the present. In modern times, cairns are often erected as landmarks, a use they have had since ancient times.  However, since prehistory, they have also been built and used as burial monuments; for defense and hunting; for ceremonial purposes, sometimes relating to  astronomy; to locate buried items, such as caches of food or objects; and to mark trails, among other purposes. 

Characteristic subgroup<====>7198<====>Characteristic subgroupIn mathematics, particularly in the area of abstract algebra known as group theory, a characteristic subgroup is a subgroup that is mapped to itself by every automorphism of the parent group.Because every conjugation map is an inner automorphism, every characteristic subgroup is normal; though the converse is not guaranteed.   Examples of characteristic subgroups include the commutator subgroup and the center of a group. DefinitionA subgroup   of a group   is called characteristic subgroup,  , if for every automorphism   of  ,   holds, i. e. 

List of cat breeds<====>7199<====>List of cat breeds The following list of cat breeds includes only domestic cat breeds and domestic × wild hybrids.  The list includes established breeds recognized by various cat registries, new and experimental breeds, distinct domestic populations not being actively developed, and lapsed breeds.The International Cat Association (TICA) recognizes 58, The International Cat Association - TICA Breed Standards  the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognizes 44, Cat Fanciers' Association - CFA Breed Standards  and Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe) recognizes 43.  Fédération Internationale Féline - FIFe Breed Standards Inconsistency in breed classification among registries means that an individual animal may be considered different breeds by different registries. 

Class action<====>7200<====>Class action  A class action, class suit, or representative action is a type of lawsuit where one of the parties is a group of people who are represented collectively by a member of that group.   The class action originated in the United States and is still predominantly a U. S.  phenomenon, but Canada, as well as several European countries with civil law have made changes in recent years to allow consumer organizations to bring claims on behalf of consumers. DescriptionIn a typical class action, a plaintiff sues a defendant or a number of defendants on behalf of a group, or class, of absent parties. 

Contempt of court<====>7201<====>Contempt of court Contempt of court, often referred to simply as "contempt", is the offence of being disobedient to or discourteous towards a court of law and its officers in the form of behavior that opposes or defies the authority, justice and dignity of the court.    It manifests itself in willful disregard of or disrespect for the authority of a court of law, which is often behavior that is illegal because it does not obey or respect the rules of a law court.   There are broadly two categories of contempt: being rude or disrespectful to legal authorities in the courtroom, or wilfully failing to obey a court order. 

Corroborating evidence<====>7202<====>Corroborating evidence  Corroborating evidence (or corroboration) is evidence that supports a proposition already supported by initial evidence, therefore confirming the original proposition.  For example, W, a witness, testifies that she saw X drive his automobile into a green car.   Meanwhile, Y, another witness, testifies that when he examined X's car, later that day, he noticed green paint on its fender.  There can also be corroborating evidence related to a certain source, such as what makes an author think a certain way due to the evidence that was supplied by witnesses or objects.  Another type of corroborating evidence comes from using the Baconian method, i. 

Cross-examination<====>7203<====>Cross-examination   In law, cross-examination is the interrogation of a witness called by one's opponent.  It is preceded by direct examination (in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, South Africa, India and Pakistan known as examination-in-chief) and may be followed by a redirect (re-examination in England, Scotland, Australia, Canada, South Africa, India, Hong Kong, and Pakistan). Variations by jurisdictionIn the United States federal Courts, a cross-examining attorney is typically not permitted to ask questions that do not pertain to the testimony offered during direct examination, but most state courts do permit a lawyer to cross-examine a witness on matters not raised during direct examination.

Current expression (from 1925) for the part of Oslo that was founded by King Christian IV.Freetown Christiania (or Christiania), a self-proclaimed autonomous neighborhood of Copenhagen, DenmarkChristiania Township, Minnesota, a township in Jackson CountyChristiania Township, North Dakota, township in Burleigh CountyOtherChristiania Theatre in  Oslo, NorwayChristiania Bank, a former Norwegian bankChristiania (brachiopod), a genus of Strophomenid brachiopods found in the Arenig geological groupChristiania bikes, family tricycle designed in DenmarkSee alsoChristiana (disambiguation) 

Charles d'Abancour<====>7207<====>Charles d'Abancour Charles Xavier Joseph de Franque Ville d'Abancour (4 July 1758 9 September 1792)  was a French statesman, minister to Louis XVI.  BiographyD'Abancourt was born in Douai, and was the nephew of Charles Alexandre de Calonne.   He was Louis XVI's last minister of war (July 1792), and organised the defence of the Tuileries Palace during the 10th of August attack.  Ordered by the Legislative Assembly to send away the Swiss Guards, he refused, and was arrested for treason to the nation and sent to Orléans to be tried.  At the end of August the Assembly ordered Abancourt and the other prisoners at Orléans to be transferred to Paris with an escort commanded by Claude Fournier l'Americain. 

Curtiss P-40 Warhawk<====>7211<====>Curtiss P-40 Warhawk   The Curtiss P-40 Warhawk is an American single-engined, single-seat, all-metal fighter and ground-attack aircraft that first flew in 1938.  The P-40 design was a modification of the previous Curtiss P-36 Hawk which reduced development time and enabled a rapid entry into production and operational service.  The Warhawk was used by most Allied powers during World War II, and remained in frontline service until the end of the war.  It was the third most-produced American fighter, after the P-51 and P-47; by November 1944, when production of the P-40 ceased, 13,738 had been built, Murphy and McNiece 2009, p. 

Creed<====>7212<====>Creed    A creed (also known as a confession, symbol, or statement of faith) is a statement of the shared beliefs of a religious community in the form of a fixed formula summarizing core tenets. One of the most widely used creeds in Christianity is the Nicene Creed, first formulated in AD 325 at the First Council of Nicaea.  It was based on Christian understanding of the Canonical Gospels, the letters of the New Testament and to a lesser extent the Old Testament.  Affirmation of this creed, which describes the Trinity, is generally taken as a fundamental test of orthodoxy for most Christian denominations. 

Claudius Aelianus<====>7213<====>Claudius Aelianus Claudius Aelianus ( ;  c.  175 c.  235 AD), commonly Aelian ( ), born at Praeneste, was a Roman author and teacher of rhetoric who flourished under Septimius Severus and probably outlived Elagabalus, who died in 222.  He spoke Greek so perfectly that he was called "honey-tongued" (meliglossos); Roman-born, he preferred Greek authors, and wrote in a slightly archaizing Greek himself.    This cites:Editio princeps of complete works by Gesner, 1556; Hercher, 1864-1866. English translation of the Various History only by Fleming, 1576, and Stanley, 1665Translation of the Letters by Quillard (French), 1895 His two chief works are valuable for the numerous quotations from the works of earlier authors, which are otherwise lost, and for the surprising lore, which offers unexpected glimpses into the Greco-Roman world-view. 

Callisto (mythology)<====>7214<====>Callisto (mythology)In Greek mythology, Callisto or Kallisto ( ;    ) was a nymph, or the daughter  of King Lycaon; the myth varies in such details.   She was one of the followers of Artemis, or Diana for the Romans, who attracted Zeus (Jupiter).   He transformed himself into the figure of Artemis and seduced her in this disguise.   She fell pregnant and this was eventually discovered and expelled from  Artemis's group, after which a furious Hera (Juno, wife of her seducer) transformed her into a bear.   Later, just as she was about to be killed by her son when he was hunting, she was set among the stars as Ursa Major ("the Great Bear"). 

Cookie<====>7218<====>Cookie  A cookie is a baked or cooked food that is small, flat and sweet.  It usually contains flour, sugar and some type of oil or fat.   It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, nuts, etc. In most English-speaking countries except for the US and Canada, crisp cookies are called biscuits.  Chewier biscuits are sometimes called cookies even in the UK.Some cookies may also be named by their shape, such as date squares or bars. Cookies or biscuits may be mass-produced in factories, made in small bakeries or homemade.
