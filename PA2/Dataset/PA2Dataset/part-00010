International Tin Council<====>89712<====>International Tin CouncilThe International Tin Council (ITC) was an organisation which acted on behalf of major tin producers and consumers to control the International tin market. It is no longer active.An International Tin Study Group, which was established in 1947 to survey world supply of and demand for tin, led to the treaty, the International Tin Agreement, signed in 1954, and the formation of the ITC in 1956.The objectives were to: to prevent or alleviate widespread unemployment or under-employment and other serious difficulties which are likely to result from maladjustments between the supply of and the demand for tin;to prevent excessive fluctuations in the price of tin and to achieve a reasonable degree of stability of price on a basis which will secure long-term equilibrium between supply and demand;to ensure adequate supplies of tin at reasonable prices at all times; andto provide a framework for the consideration and development of measures to promote the progressively more economic production of tin while protecting tin deposits from unnecessary waste or premature abandonment.The original members were:Consumer   Producer Australia  Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi Brazil  Bolivia  Belgium  Malaysia Canada  Nigeria  Denmark  Indonesia  Ecuador  Thailand France Federal Republic of Germany India Italy Japan Lebanon Netherlands Switzerland Spain Turkey United Kingdom United States of America After the 1954 agreement, 5 more agreements were signed every five years, in 1960, 1965, 1970, 1975, and 1980. By the sixth agreement, established at the United Nations Tin Conference, 1980,  new consumers included Finland, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, and Sweden.  New producers were Australia, Brazil and Zaire. At various times Guinea, Mexico, Republic of Korea, the United Arab Republic, Israel, Liberia, Panama, Yugoslavia, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Poland, the Philippines, Czechoslovakia, Taiwan, Romania, Nicaragua, German Democratic Republic, and Austria held membership.CollapseWith the advent of aluminium containers, the use of protective polymer lacquers inside cans, and increased recycling by industry, the demand for tin decreased considerably by the early 1980s, and in October 1985 the ITC could no longer maintain the price.  It eventually ran out of money buying up tin on the metals markets. Attempts to refinance the ITC were eventually abandoned, and since then, as with many other raw materials, the price has generally declined as alternatives become more attractive. Association of Tin Producing CountriesIn 1984 an Association of Tin Producing Countries was created with members: Australia, Bolivia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, and Zaire.

Scout (Scouting)<====>89807<====>Scout (Scouting)    A scout (in some countries a boy scout, girl scout or pathfinder) is a child, usually 10–18 years of age, participating in the worldwide Scouting movement.  Because of the large age and development span, many Scouting associations have split this age group into a junior and a senior section.  Scouts are organized into troops averaging 20–30 Scouts under the guidance of one or more Scout Leaders.  Troops subdivide into patrols of about six Scouts and engage in outdoor and special interest activities.  Troops may affiliate with local, national, and international organizations.

Seismic wave<====>89830<====>Seismic wave  Seismic waves are waves of energy that travel through the Earth's layers, and are a result of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, magma movement, large landslides and large man-made explosions that give out low-frequency acoustic energy.  Many other natural and anthropogenic sources create low-amplitude waves commonly referred to as ambient vibrations.  Seismic waves are studied by geophysicists called seismologists.  Seismic wave fields are recorded by a seismometer, hydrophone (in water), or accelerometer. The propagation velocity of the waves depends on density and elasticity of the medium.  Velocity tends to increase with depth and ranges from approximately 2 to 8 km/s in the Earth's crust, up to 13 km/s in the deep mantle.

Cystoscopes range from pediatric to adult and from the thickness of a pencil up to approximately 9mm and have a light at the tip. 

Field-emission electric propulsion<====>89918<====>Field-emission electric propulsionField-emission electric propulsion (FEEP) is an advanced electrostatic space propulsion concept, a form of ion thruster, that uses liquid metal (usually either caesium, indium or mercury) as a propellant.  A FEEP device consists of an emitter and an accelerator electrode.  A potential difference of the order of 10 kV is applied between the two, which generates a strong electric field at the tip of the metal surface.  The interplay of electric force and surface tension generates surface instabilities which give rise to Taylor cones on the liquid surface.  At sufficiently high values of the applied field, ions are extracted from the cone tip by field evaporation or similar mechanisms, which then are accelerated to high velocities (typically 100 km/s or more).

The two species — the red acouchi (M.  acouchy) in the Guianas of Amazonia and nearby parts of Brazil, and the green acouchi (M.  pratti) in western Amazonia - differ in coloration and other characteristics.  The taxonomy of the genus has historically been confused, with some authors applying the "M. 

Religious denomination<====>89986<====>Religious denomination  A religious denomination is a subgroup within a religion that operates under a common name, tradition, and identity.

Taligent<====>89989<====>Taligent Taligent (a portmanteau of talent and intelligent) "Apple surrenders the Pink (to Microsoft)", The Register, 3 October 2008  is the name of an object-oriented operating system, and the company that was dedicated to producing it.  Initially started as a project within Apple to provide a replacement for the classic Mac OS, it was later spun off into a joint venture with IBM as part of the AIM alliance, with the purpose of building a competing platform to Microsoft Cairo and NeXTSTEP. The development process never worked, and Taligent is often cited as an example of a project death march. 

Bytecode<====>89997<====>Bytecode  Bytecode, also termed portable code or p-code, is a form of instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter.  Unlike human-readable source code, bytecodes are compact numeric codes, constants, and references (normally numeric addresses) that encode the result of compiler parsing and semantic analysis of things like type, scope, and nesting depths of program objects.  They thus allow much better performance than interpreting source code directly.   The name bytecode stems from instruction sets that have one-byte opcodes followed by optional parameters.  Intermediate representations such as bytecode may be output by programming language implementations to ease interpretation, or it may be used to reduce hardware and operating system dependence by allowing the same code to run cross-platform, on different devices. 

Pre-Columbian era<====>90001<====>Pre-Columbian era The Pre-Columbian era incorporates all period subdivisions in the history and prehistory of the Americas before the appearance of significant European influences on the American continents, spanning the time of the original settlement in the Upper Paleolithic period to European colonization during the Early Modern period. While the phrase "pre-Columbian era" literally refers only to the time preceding Christopher Columbus's voyages of 1492, in practice the phrase is usually used to denote the entire history of indigenous Americas cultures until those cultures were exterminated, diminished, or extensively altered by Europeans, even if this happened decades or centuries after Columbus's first landing. 

Filippo Brunelleschi<====>90007<====>Filippo Brunelleschi   Filippo Brunelleschi ( ; 1377 – April 15, 1446) was an Italian designer and a key figure in architecture, recognised to be the first modern engineer, planner and sole construction supervisor.  He was one of the founding fathers of the Renaissance.  He is generally well known for developing a technique for linear perspective in art and for building the dome of the Florence Cathedral.  Heavily dependent on mirrors and geometry, to "reinforce Christian spiritual reality", his formulation of linear perspective governed pictorial depiction of space until the late 19th century. It also had the most profound – and quite unanticipated – influence on the rise of modern science.

Flocking (behavior)<====>90021<====>Flocking (behavior)Flocking behavior is the behavior exhibited when a group of birds, called a flock, are foraging or in flight.  There are parallels with the shoaling behavior of fish, the swarming behavior of insects, and herd behavior of land animals. Computer simulations and mathematical models which have been developed to emulate the flocking behaviors of birds can generally be applied also to the "flocking" behavior of other species.  As a result, the term "flocking" is sometimes applied, in computer science, to species other than birds. This article is about the modelling of flocking behavior.  From the perspective of the mathematical modeller, "flocking" is the collective motion of a large number of self-propelled entities and is a collective animal behavior exhibited by many living beings such as birds, fish, bacteria, and  insects.

Many species are single-celled and microscopic (including phytoplankton and other microalgae); many others are multicellular to one degree or another, some of these growing to large size (for example, seaweeds such as kelp and Sargassum).

Super-Poulet number<====>90465<====>Super-Poulet numberA super-Poulet number is a Poulet number, or pseudoprime to base 2, whose every divisor d divides2 d  − 2.For example, 341 is a super-Poulet number: it has positive divisors {1, 11, 31, 341} and we have:(2 11  - 2) / 11 = 2046 / 11 = 186(2 31  - 2) / 31 = 2147483646 / 31 = 69273666(2 341  - 2) / 341 = 13136332798696798888899954724741608669335164206654835981818117894215788100763407304286671514789484550When a composite number is a pseudoprime to base 2, but not to every base (That is, not a Carmichael number), then it is a super-Poulet number, and when   \frac{ \Phi_n(2)}{gcd(n, \Phi_n(2))}  is not prime, then it and every divisor of it are a pseudoprime to base 2, and a super-Poulet number. The super-Poulet numbers below 10,000 are  :n  1 341 = 11 × 31 2 1387 = 19 × 73 3 2047 = 23 × 89 4 2701 = 37 × 73 5 3277 = 29 × 113 6 4033 = 37 × 109 7 4369 = 17 × 257 8 4681 = 31 × 151 9 5461 = 43 × 127 10 7957 = 73 × 109 11 8321 = 53 × 157 Super-Poulet numbers with 3 or more distinct prime divisorsIt is relatively easy to get super-Poulet numbers with 3 distinct prime divisors. If you find three Poulet numbers with three common prime factors, you get a super-Poulet number, as you built the product of the three prime factors.Example:2701 = 37 *  73 is a Poulet number, 4033 = 37 * 109 is a Poulet number, 7957 = 73 * 109 is a Poulet number;so 294409 = 37 * 73 * 109 is a Poulet number too.Super-Poulet numbers with up to 7 distinct prime factors you can get with the following numbers: { 103, 307, 2143, 2857, 6529, 11119, 131071 }{ 709, 2833, 3541, 12037, 31153, 174877, 184081 }{ 1861, 5581, 11161, 26041, 37201, 87421, 102301 }{ 6421, 12841, 51361, 57781, 115561, 192601, 205441 }For example, 1118863200025063181061994266818401 = 6421 * 12841 * 51361 * 57781 * 115561 * 192601 * 205441 is a super-Poulet number with 7 distinct prime factors and 120 Poulet numbers.External links Numericana

Corn Laws<====>90558<====>Corn Laws   The Corn Laws were tariffs and restrictions on imported food and grain ("corn") enforced in Great Britain between 1815 and 1846.

The Corn Laws enhanced the profits and political power associated with land ownership.  The laws raised food prices and the costs of living for the British public, and hampered the growth of other British economic sectors, such as manufacturing, by reducing the disposable income of the British public.

Geodesic<====>91096<====>Geodesic  In differential geometry, a geodesic (   ) is a generalization of the notion of a "straight line"  to "curved spaces".  The term "geodesic" comes from geodesy, the science of measuring the size and shape of Earth; in the original sense, a geodesic was the shortest route between two points on the Earth's surface, namely, a segment of a great circle.   The term has been generalized to include measurements in much more general mathematical spaces; for example, in graph theory, one might consider a geodesic between two vertices/nodes of a graph. In the presence of an affine connection, a geodesic is defined to be a curve whose tangent vectors remain parallel if they are transported along it.

Michelson–Morley experiment<====>91100<====>Michelson–Morley experimentThe Michelson–Morley experiment was performed between April and July, 1887 by Albert A.  Michelson and Edward W.  Morley at what is now Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, and published in November of the same year.   It compared the speed of light in perpendicular directions, in an attempt to detect the relative motion of matter through the stationary luminiferous aether ("aether wind").  The result was negative, in that the expected difference between the speed of light in the direction of movement through the presumed aether, and the speed at right angles, was found not to exist; this result is generally considered to be the first strong evidence against the then-prevalent aether theory, and initiated a line of research that eventually led to special relativity, which rules out a stationary aether.

Doubling the cube<====>91110<====>Doubling the cubeDoubling the cube, also known as the Delian problem, is an ancient  geometric problem.  Given the edge of a cube, the problem requires the construction of the edge of a second cube whose volume is double that of the first, using only the tools of a compass and straightedge.  As with the related problems of squaring the circle and trisecting the angle, doubling the cube is now known to be impossible. The Egyptians, Indians, and particularly the Greeks  were aware of the problem and made many futile attempts at solving what they saw as an obstinate but soluble problem. 

Angle trisection<====>91111<====>Angle trisectionAngle trisection is a classical problem of compass and straightedge constructions of ancient Greek mathematics.  It concerns construction of an angle equal to one third of a given arbitrary angle, using only two tools: an unmarked straightedge and a compass. The problem as stated is generally impossible to solve, as proved by Pierre Wantzel in 1837.  However, although there is no way to trisect an angle in general with just a compass and a straightedge, some special angles can be trisected.  For example, it is relatively straightforward to trisect a right angle (that is, to construct an angle of measure 30 degrees).

K'awiil<====>91141<====>K'awiilK'awiil, in the Post-Classic codices corresponding to God K, is a Maya deity identified with lightning, serpents, fertility and maize.  He is characterized by a zoomorphic head, with large eyes, long, upturned snout and attenuated serpent tooth.   A torch, stone celt, or cigar, normally emitting smoke, comes out of his forehead, while a serpent leg represents a lightning bolt.  In this way, K'awiil personifies the lightning axe both of the rain deity and of the king as depicted on his stelae. NamesFrom the correspondence between Landa's description of the New Year rituals and the depiction of these rituals in the Dresden Codex,    it can be inferred that in 16th-century Yucatán, K'awiil was called Bolon Dzacab 'Innumerable (bolon 'nine, innumerable') maternal generations', perhaps a metaphor for fertility.

At the press conference to announce the forthcoming publication, Trevor-Roper announced that on reflection he had changed his mind, and other historians also raised questions concerning their validity. 

Axial tilt<====>91173<====>Axial tilt  In astronomy, axial tilt, also known as obliquity, is the angle between an object's rotational axis and its orbital axis, or, equivalently, the angle between its equatorial plane and orbital plane.It differs from orbital inclination. At an obliquity of zero, the two axes point in the same direction; i. e. , the rotational axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane.  Earth's obliquity oscillates between 22. 1 and 24. 5 degrees  on a 41,000-year cycle; the earth's mean obliquity is currently   and decreasing.  Over the course of an orbit, the obliquity usually does not change considerably, and the orientation of the axis remains the same relative to the background stars.

System analysis<====>91182<====>System analysis   System analysis in the field of electrical engineering that characterizes electrical systems and their properties.   System analysis can be used to represent almost anything from population growth to audio speakers; electrical engineers often use it because of its direct relevance to many areas of their discipline, most notably signal processing, communication systems and control systems. Characterization of systemsA system is characterized by how it responds to input signals.   In general, a system has one or more input signals and one or more output signals.   Therefore, one natural characterization of systems is by how many inputs and outputs they have:SISO (Single Input, Single Output)SIMO (Single Input, Multiple Outputs)MISO (Multiple Inputs, Single Output)MIMO (Multiple Inputs, Multiple Outputs)It is often useful (or necessary) to break up a system into smaller pieces for analysis.

Inverse gambler's fallacy<====>91388<====>Inverse gambler's fallacyThe inverse gambler's fallacy, named by philosopher Ian Hacking, is a formal fallacy of Bayesian inference which is an inverse of the better known gambler's fallacy.  It is the fallacy of concluding, on the basis of an unlikely outcome of a random process, that the process is likely to have occurred many times before.  For example, if one observes a pair of fair dice being rolled and turning up double sixes, it is wrong to suppose that this lends any support to the hypothesis that the dice have been rolled many times before.  We can see this from the Bayesian update rule: letting U denote the unlikely outcome of the random process and M the proposition that the process has occurred many times before, we have P(M|U) = P(M) \frac{P(U|M)}{P(U)} and since P(U|M) = P(U) (the outcome of the process is unaffected by previous occurrences), it follows that P(M|U) = P(M); that is, our confidence in M should be unchanged when we learn U.

Ornithine<====>92135<====>Ornithine Ornithine is a non-proteinogenic amino acid that plays a role in the urea cycle.  Ornithine is abnormally accumulated in the body in ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.  The radical is ornithyl. Role in urea cycle L -Ornithine is one of the products of the action of the enzyme arginase on  L -arginine, creating urea.  Therefore, ornithine is a central part of the urea cycle, which allows for the disposal of excess nitrogen.  Ornithine is recycled and, in a manner, is a catalyst.  First, ammonia is converted into carbamoyl phosphate ( ).  Ornithine is converted into a urea derivative at the δ (terminal) nitrogen by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase.

Circular dichroism<====>92193<====>Circular dichroismCircular dichroism (CD) is dichroism involving circularly polarized light, i. e. , the differential absorption of left- and right-handed light.  Left-hand circular (LHC) and right-hand circular (RHC) polarized light represent two possible spin angular momentum states for a photon, and so circular dichroism is also referred to as dichroism for spin angular momentum.    This phenomenon was discovered by Jean-Baptiste Biot, Augustin Fresnel, and Aimé Cotton in the first half of the 19th century.   It is exhibited in the absorption bands of optically active chiral molecules.  CD spectroscopy has a wide range of applications in many different fields.

Utterance<====>92200<====>Utterance  In spoken language analysis, an utterance is the smallest unit of speech.  It is a continuous piece of speech beginning and ending with a clear pause.  In the case of oral languages, it is generally but not always bounded by silence.  Utterances do not exist in written language, only their representations do.  They can be represented and delineated in written language in many ways. In oral/spoken language utterances have several features including paralinguistic features which are aspects of speech such as facial expression, gesture, and posture.  Prosodic features include stress, intonation, and tone of voice, as well as ellipsis, which are words that the listener inserts in spoken language to fill gaps.

Bunkers can also be used as protection from tornadoes. Trench bunkers are small concrete structures, partly dug into the ground.  Many artillery installations, especially for coastal artillery, have historically been protected by extensive bunker systems. 

Magnetic circular dichroism<====>92206<====>Magnetic circular dichroismMagnetic circular dichroism (MCD) is the differential absorption of left and right circularly polarized (LCP and RCP) light, induced in a sample by a strong magnetic field oriented parallel to the direction of light propagation.  MCD measurements can detect transitions which are too weak to be seen in conventional optical absorption spectra; they can also probe paramagnetic properties and the symmetry of the electronic levels of the studied systems, such as metal ion sites.    HistoryIt was first shown by Faraday that optical activity (the Faraday effect) could be induced in matter by a longitudinal magnetic field (a field in the direction of light propagation).

Electron transport chain<====>92236<====>Electron transport chainAn electron transport chain (ETC) is a series of complexes that transfer electrons from electron donors to electron acceptors via redox (both reduction and oxidation occurring simultaneously) reactions, and couples this electron transfer with the transfer of protons (H +  ions) across a membrane.  This creates an electrochemical proton gradient that drives the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a molecule that stores energy chemically in the form of highly strained bonds.  The molecules of the chain include peptides, enzymes (which are proteins or protein complexes), and others.  The final acceptor of electrons in the electron transport chain during aerobic respiration is molecular oxygen although a variety of acceptors other than oxygen such as sulfate exist in anaerobic respiration.

Hunab Ku<====>92271<====>Hunab KuHunab Ku ( ) is a Colonial period Yucatec Maya reducido term meaning "The One God".  It is used in colonial, and more particularly in doctrinal texts to refer to the Christian God.  Since the word is found frequently in the Chilam Balam of Chumayel, a syncretistic document heavily influenced by Christianity, it refers specifically to the Christian god as a translation into Maya of the Christian concept of one God, used to enculturate the previously polytheist Maya to the new Colonial religion.   References to Hunab Ku have figured prominently in New Age Mayanism such as that of José Argüelles. 

Ixchel<====>92273<====>IxchelIxchel or Ix Chel ( ) is the 16th-century name of the aged jaguar goddess of midwifery and medicine in ancient Maya culture.

Mechanical equilibrium<====>92290<====>Mechanical equilibriumIn classical mechanics, a particle is in mechanical equilibrium if the net force on that particle is zero.    By extension, a physical system made up of many parts is in mechanical equilibrium if the net force on each of its individual parts is zero.   In addition to defining mechanical equilibrium in terms of force, there are many alternative definitions for mechanical equilibrium which are all mathematically equivalent.  In terms of momentum, a system is in equilibrium if the momentum of its parts is all constant.  In terms of velocity, the system is in equilibrium if velocity is constant. 

Sewing<====>92295<====>Sewing   Sewing  is the craft of fastening or attaching objects using stitches made with a needle and thread.  Sewing is one of the oldest of the textile arts, arising in the Paleolithic era.  Before the invention of spinning yarn or weaving fabric, archaeologists believe Stone Age people across Europe and Asia sewed fur and skin clothing using bone, antler or ivory needles and "thread" made of various animal body parts including sinew, catgut, and veins.  For thousands of years, all sewing was done by hand.   The invention of the sewing machine in the 19th century and the rise of computerization in the 20th century led to mass production and export of sewn objects, but hand sewing is still practiced around the world. 

Władysław I the Elbow-high<====>92302<====>Władysław I the Elbow-high   Władysław the Short or Elbow-high (or Ladislaus I of Poland,  ; 1261 – 2 March 1333) was a King of Poland.   He was a Duke until 1300, and Prince of Kraków from 1305 until his coronation as King on 20 January 1320.  Because of his short stature he was nicknamed 'Łokietek', a diminutive of the word 'łokieć'.  It translates as "ell" or "elbow", a medieval measure of length, as in "elbow-high".  In old Polish, an ell was a measure of length:  one ell equalled 0. 78 meters in length. 

Illuminated manuscript<====>92310<====>Illuminated manuscript An illuminated manuscript is a manuscript in which the text is supplemented with such decoration as initials, borders (marginalia) and miniature illustrations.  In the strictest definition, the term refers only to manuscripts decorated with gold or silver; but in both common usage and modern scholarship, the term refers to any decorated or illustrated manuscript from Western traditions.   Comparable Far Eastern and Mesoamerican works are described as painted.  Islamic manuscripts may be referred to as illuminated, illustrated or painted, though using essentially the same techniques as Western works.  This article covers the technical, social and economic history of the subject; for an art-historical account, see miniature. 

Nils Gabriel Sefström<====>92311<====>Nils Gabriel Sefström Nils Gabriel Sefström (2 June 1787 – 30 November 1845) was a Swedish chemist.  Sefström was a student of Berzelius and, when studying the brittleness of steel in 1830, he rediscovered a new chemical element, to which he gave the name vanadium.    Vanadium was first discovered by the Spanish-Mexican mineralogist Andrés Manuel del Río in 1801.   He named it erythronium.   Friedrich Wöhler later confirmed that vanadium and erythronium were the same substance.    Sefström was member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences from 1815. The Spitzbergen glacier Sefströmbreen,  and the mountain ridge of Sefströmkammen, are named after him.

Prostaglandin<====>92336<====>ProstaglandinThe prostaglandins (PG) are a group of physiologically active lipid compounds having diverse hormone-like effects in animals.   Prostaglandins have been found in almost every tissue in humans and other animals.  They are derived enzymatically from fatty acids.  Every prostaglandin contains 20 carbon atoms, including a 5-carbon ring.  They are a subclass of eicosanoids and of the prostanoid class of fatty acid derivatives. The structural differences between prostaglandins account for their different biological activities.  A given prostaglandin may have different and even opposite effects in different tissues in some cases.  The ability of the same prostaglandin to stimulate a reaction in one tissue and inhibit the same reaction in another tissue is determined by the type of receptor to which the prostaglandin binds. 

Multistatic radar<====>92340<====>Multistatic radarA multistatic radar system contains multiple spatially diverse monostatic radar or bistatic radar components with a shared area of coverage.   An important distinction of systems based on these individual radar geometries is the added requirement for some level of data fusion to take place between component parts. The spatial diversity afforded by multistatic systems allows for different aspects of a target to be viewed simultaneously.   The potential for information gain can give rise to a number of advantages over conventional systems. Multistatic radar is often referred to as 'multisite' or 'netted' radar, and is comparable with the idea of macrodiversity in communications.

Etymology"Hyperbaton" is a word borrowed from the Greek hyperbaton ( ), meaning "stepping over," which is derived from hyper ("over") and bainein ("to step"), with the -tos verbal adjective suffix. 

Catachresis<====>92379<====>Catachresis  Catachresis (from Greek  , "abuse"), originally meaning a semantic misuse or error—e. g. , using "militate" for "mitigate", "chronic" for "severe", "anachronism" for "anomaly", "alibi" for "excuse", etc. —is also the name given to many different types of figures of speech in which a word or phrase is being applied in a way that significantly departs from conventional (or traditional) usage.  ClassificationThere are various subdefinitions of catachresis. Definition  Example Crossing categorical boundaries with words, because there otherwise would be no suitable word.

Chiasmus<====>92382<====>Chiasmus   In rhetoric, chiasmus, or less commonly chiasm, (Latin term from Greek χίασμα, "crossing", from the Greek χιάζω, chiázō, "to shape like the letter Χ") is the figure of speech in which two or more clauses are presented to the reader or hearer, then presented again in reverse order, in order to make a larger point.  To diagram a simple chiasmus, the clauses are often labelled in the form A B B A.  For example, John F.  Kennedy said, "ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country". 

Algolagnia<====>92383<====>Algolagnia Algolagnia ( ; from  , álgos, "pain", and  , lagneía, "lust") is a sexual tendency which is defined by deriving sexual pleasure and stimulation from physical pain,  often involving an erogenous zone.  Studies conducted indicate differences in how the brains of those with algolagnia interpret nerve input.  History of researchIn 1892, Albert von Schrenck-Notzing introduced the term algolagnia to describe "sexual" masochism, to differentiate it from Fere's earlier term called "algophilia"; Schrenck-Notzing's interpretation was that algolagnia involved lust, not love as Fere interpreted the phenomenon.   (It should be cautioned, though, that the definitions regarding sadism and masochism as medical terms have changed over the years (as also noted in the main article for that topic) and are still evolving,  and there are also non-medical definitions of sadomasochism.

Cytochrome c<====>92388<====>Cytochrome c The cytochrome complex, or cyt c is a small hemeprotein found loosely associated with the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.  It belongs to the cytochrome c family of proteins.  Cytochrome c is highly water-soluble, unlike other cytochromes, and is an essential component of the electron transport chain, where it carries one electron.  It is capable of undergoing oxidation and reduction, but does not bind oxygen.  It transfers electrons between Complexes III (Coenzyme Q – Cyt C reductase) and IV (Cyt C oxidase).   In humans, cytochrome c is encoded by the CYCS gene. 

Zeolite<====>92389<====>ZeoliteZeolites are microporous, aluminosilicate minerals commonly used as commercial adsorbents and catalysts.   The term zeolite was originally coined in 1756 by Swedish mineralogist Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who observed that rapidly heating the material, believed to have been stilbite, produced large amounts of steam from water that had been adsorbed by the material.  Based on this, he called the material zeolite, from the Greek  , meaning "to boil" and  , meaning "stone".   The classic reference for the field has been Breck's book Zeolite Molecular Sieves: Structure, Chemistry, And Use.  Zeolites occur naturally but are also produced industrially on a large scale.

Proton pump<====>92441<====>Proton pump A proton pump is an integral membrane protein that builds up a proton gradient across a biological membrane.  Proton pumps catalyze the following reaction:  [on one side of a biological membrane]  + energy   \rightleftharpoons[on the other side of the membrane] Mechanisms are based on energy-induced conformational changes of the protein structure or on the Q cycle. During evolution, proton pumps have arisen independently on multiple occasions.  Thus, not only throughout nature but also within single cells, different proton pumps that are evolutionarily unrelated can be found.  Proton pumps are divided into different major classes of pumps that utilize different sources of energy, have different polypeptide compositions and evolutionary origins.

Lambert W function<====>92465<====>Lambert W functionIn mathematics, the Lambert-W function, also called the omega function or product logarithm, is a set of functions,namely the branches of the inverse relation of the function f(z) = ze z  where e z  is the exponential function and z is any complex number.  In other words z = f^{-1}(ze^z) = W(ze^z) By substituting the above equation in  z' = ze^z  , we get the defining equation for the W function (and for the W relation in general): z' = W(z')e^{W(z')} for any complex number z. Since the function ƒ is not injective, the relation W is multivalued (except at 0).

Lipoprotein<====>92512<====>Lipoprotein A lipoprotein is a biochemical assembly whose purpose is to transport hydrophobic lipid (a. k. a.  fat) molecules in water, as in blood or extracellular fluid.  They have a single-layer phospholipid and cholesterol outer shell, with the hydrophilic portions oriented outward toward the surrounding water and lipophilic portions of each molecule oriented inwards toward the lipids molecules within the particles.  Apolipoproteins are embedded in the membrane, both stabilising the complex and giving it functional identity determining its fate.  Thus the complex serves to emulsify the fats.  Many enzymes, transporters, structural proteins, antigens, adhesions, and toxins are lipoproteins. 

Detergent<====>92514<====>Detergent A detergent is a surfactant or a mixture of surfactants with cleaning properties in dilute solutions.   These substances are usually alkylbenzenesulfonates, a family of compounds that are similar to soap but are more soluble in hard water, because the polar sulfonate (of detergents) is less likely than the polar carboxylate (of soap) to bind to calcium and other ions found in hard water. In most household contexts, the term detergent by itself refers specifically to laundry detergent or dish detergent, as opposed to hand soap or other types of cleaning agents.   Detergents are commonly available as powders or concentrated solutions.

Ferric<====>92522<====>FerricFerric refers to iron-containing materials or compounds.  In chemistry the term is reserved for iron with an oxidation number of +3, also denoted iron(III) or Fe 3+ .  On the other hand, ferrous refers to iron with oxidation number of +2, denoted iron(II) or Fe 2+ .  Iron(III) is usually the most stable form of iron in air, as illustrated by the pervasiveness of rust, an insoluble iron(III)-containing material.  The word ferric is derived from the Latin word ferrum for iron. Ferric iron and lifeMany proteins contain ferric ions.  Examples include iron-sulfur clusters, oxyhemoglobin, ferritin, and the cytochromes. 

Ferrous<====>92523<====>FerrousIn chemistry, ferrous (Fe 2+ ), indicates a divalent iron compound (+2 oxidation state), as opposed to ferric, which indicates a trivalent iron compound (+3 oxidation state).   .   This usage has mostly been deprecated, with current IUPAC nomenclature having names containing the oxidation state in bracketed Roman numerals instead, such as iron(II) oxide for ferrous oxide (FeO), and iron(III) oxide for ferric oxide (Fe 2 O 3 ). Outside chemistry, ferrous indicates the presence of iron.   The word is derived from the Latin word   ("iron").   Ferrous metals include steel and pig iron (with a carbon content of a few percent) and alloys of iron with other metals (such as stainless steel). 

Hemeprotein<====>92524<====>HemeproteinA hemeprotein (or haemprotein; also hemoprotein or haemoprotein), or heme protein, is a protein that contains a heme prosthetic group.

County Clare, being west of the Shannon but part of the province of Munster, is the major exception.  The river represents a major physical barrier between east and west, with fewer than thirty crossing-points between Limerick city in the south and the village of Dowra in the north. 

Peroxidase<====>92532<====>Peroxidase  Peroxidases (EC number 1. 11. 1. x) are a large family of enzymes that typically catalyze a reaction of the form: {ROOR'} + \overset{electron\atop donor}{2e^-} + 2H+ ->[\ce{Peroxidase}] {ROH} + R'OH For many of these enzymes the optimal substrate is hydrogen peroxide, but others are more active with organic hydroperoxides such as lipid peroxides.  Peroxidases can contain a heme cofactor in their active sites, or alternately redox-active cysteine or selenocysteine residues. The nature of the electron donor is very dependent on the structure of the enzyme. For example, horseradish peroxidase can use a variety of organic compounds as electron donors and acceptors.

He was born in Västerås, the son of Bishop Johannes Rudbeckius, who was personal chaplain to King Gustavus Adolphus, and the father of botanist Olof Rudbeck the Younger.   Rudbeck is primarily known for his contributions in two fields: human anatomy and linguistics, but he was also accomplished in many other fields including music and botany. 

Community of Christ<====>92908<====>Community of Christ Community of Christ (known from 1872 to 2001 as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS)) is an American-based international church    with roots in the Latter Day Saint movement.

The Community of Christ is rooted in Restorationist traditions.  Although in some respects it is congruent with mainline Protestant Christian attitudes, it is in many ways theologically distinct, continuing such features as prophetic revelation. 

Bodhi<====>92912<====>Bodhi   Bodhi (Sanskrit:  ; and Pali) in Buddhism is the understanding possessed by a Buddha regarding the true nature of things.  It is traditionally translated into English with the word enlightenment, although its literal meaning is closer to "awakening".  The verbal root "budh" means to awaken. Bodhi is presented in the Nikayas as knowledge of the causal mechanism by which beings incarnate into material form and experience suffering.  Although its most common usage is in the context of Buddhism, the term buddhi is also used in other Indian philosophies and traditions. EtymologyBodhi is an abstract noun formed from the verbal root *budh- (Sanksrit:  बुद्धः (to awake, become aware, notice, know or understand) corresponding to the verbs bujjhati (Pāli) and bodhati or budhyate (Sanskrit).

Digital-to-analog converter<====>92943<====>Digital-to-analog converter   In electronics, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC, D/A, D2A, or D-to-A) is a system that converts a digital signal into an analog signal.  An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) performs the reverse function. There are several DAC architectures; the suitability of a DAC for a particular application is determined by figures of merit including: resolution, maximum sampling frequency and others.   Digital-to-analog conversion can degrade a signal, so a DAC should be specified that has insignificant errors in terms of the application.  DACs are commonly used in music players to convert digital data streams into analog audio signals.

Until Section 3 of the Act was struck down in 2013 (United States v.  Windsor), DOMA, in conjunction with other statutes, had barred same-sex married couples from being recognized as "spouses" for purposes of federal laws, effectively barring them from receiving federal marriage benefits.

Uilleann pipes<====>92979<====>Uilleann pipesThe uilleann pipes ( ;  ) are the characteristic national bagpipe of Ireland.  Earlier known in English as "union pipes", their current name is a partial translation of the Irish-language term píobaí uilleann (literally, "pipes of the elbow"), from their method of inflation.  There is no historical record of the name or use of the term 'uilleann pipes' before the twentieth century.  It was an invention of Grattan Flood    and the name stuck.

Tensegrity<====>92981<====>Tensegrity Tensegrity, tensional integrity or floating compression is a structural principle based on the use of isolated components in compression inside a net of continuous tension, in such a way that the compressed members (usually bars or struts) do not touch each other and the prestressed tensioned members (usually cables or tendons) delineate the system spatially.  The term was coined by Buckminster Fuller in the 1960s as a portmanteau of "tensional integrity".   The other denomination of tensegrity, floating compression, was used mainly by Kenneth Snelson. ConceptTensegrity structures are based on the combination of a few simple design patterns:loading members only in pure compression or pure tension, meaning the structure will only fail if the cables yield or the rods bucklepreload or tensional prestress, which allows cables to be rigid in tensionmechanical stability, which allows the members to remain in tension/compression as stress on the structure increasesBecause of these patterns, no structural member experiences a bending moment. 

Paradise<====>92982<====>Paradise Paradise is the term for a place of timeless harmony.   The Abrahamic faiths associate paradise with the Garden of Eden, that is, the perfect state of the world prior to the fall from grace, and the perfect state that will be restored in the World to Come.  Paradisaical notions are cross-cultural, often laden with pastoral imagery, and may be cosmogonical or eschatological or both,  often compared to the miseries of human civilization: in paradise there is only peace, prosperity, and happiness.  Paradise is a place of contentment, a land of luxury and fulfillment.  Paradise is often described as a "higher place", the holiest place, in contrast to this world, or underworlds such as Hell.

"La chorée fibrillaire" was first coined by Morvan in 1890 when describing patients with multiple, irregular contractions of the long muscles, cramping, weakness, pruritus, hyperhidrosis, insomnia, and delirium.    It normally presents with a slow insidious onset over months to years.    Approximately 90% of cases spontaneously go into remission, while the other 10% of cases lead to death.

Synchronous dynamic random-access memory<====>93807<====>Synchronous dynamic random-access memorySynchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) is any dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) where the operation of its external pin interface is coordinated by an externally supplied clock signal.  DRAM integrated circuits (ICs) produced from the early 1970s to mid-1990s used an asynchronous interface, in which input control signals have a direct effect on internal functions only delayed by the trip across its semiconductor pathways.  SDRAM has a synchronous interface, whereby changes on control inputs are recognised after a rising edge of its clock input.   In SDRAM families standardized by JEDEC, the clock signal controls the stepping of an internal finite state machine that responds to incoming commands.

Criticisms of globalization<====>93816<====>Criticisms of globalization  Criticism of globalization is skepticism of the claimed benefits of globalization.  Many of these views are held by the anti-globalization movement.  Globalization has created much global and internal unrest in many countries.  While the dynamics of capitalism is changing and each country is unique in its political makeup, globalization is a set-in-stone "program" that is difficult to implement without political unrest.  Globalization can be partly responsible for the current global economic crisis.  Case studies of Thailand and the Arab nations' view of globalization show that globalization is a threat to culture and religion, and it harms indigenous people groups while multinational corporations profit from it. 

Data type<====>93817<====>Data typeIn computer science and computer programming, a data type or simply type is a classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.  Most programming languages support various types of data, for example: real, integer or Boolean.  A data type provides a set of values from which an expression (i. e.  variable, function. . . ) may take its values.  The type defines the operations that can be done on the data, the meaning of the data, and the way values of that type can be stored. 

Chinese constellations<====>93821<====>Chinese constellationsTraditional Chinese astronomy has a system of dividing the celestial sphere into asterisms  or constellations, known as "officials" (Chinese   xīng guān).  星官 literally translates to "star official".

The Chinese asterisms are generally smaller than the constellations of Hellenistic tradition.  The Song dynasty (13th-century) Suzhou planisphere shows a total of 283 asterisms, comprising a total of 1,565  individual stars.  The asterisms are divided into four groups, the Twenty-Eight Mansions ( , Èrshíbā Xiù) along the ecliptic, and the Three Enclosures of the northern sky.

Solid angle<====>94102<====>Solid angle  In geometry, a solid angle (symbol:  ) is the two-dimensional angle in three-dimensional space that an object subtends at a point.  It is a measure of how large the object appears to an observer looking from that point.  In the International System of Units (SI), a solid angle is expressed in a dimensionless unit called a steradian (symbol: sr). A small object nearby may subtend the same solid angle as a larger object farther away.  For example, although the Moon is much smaller than the Sun, it is also much closer to Earth.

Muzzleloader<====>94124<====>Muzzleloader A muzzleloader is any firearm into which the projectile and usually the propellant charge is loaded from the muzzle of the gun (i. e. , from the forward, open end of the gun's barrel).  This is distinct from the more popular modern (higher tech and harder to make) designs of breech-loading firearms.  The term "muzzleloader" applies to both rifled and smoothbore type muzzleloaders, and may also refer to the marksman who specializes in the shooting of such firearms.  The firing methods, paraphernalia and mechanism further divide both categories as do caliber (from cannons to small-caliber palm guns). 

Isleworth<====>94126<====>Isleworth    Isleworth (   ) is a small town of Saxon origin sited within the London Borough of Hounslow in west London, England.

ToponymyThe name of Kentish Town is probably derived from Ken-ditch or Caen-ditch, meaning the "bed of a waterway" and is otherwise unrelated to Kent.   In researching the meaning of Ken-ditch, it has also been noted that ken is the Celtic word for both "green" and "river", while ditch refers to the River Fleet, now a subterranean river.   However, another theory is the name comes its position near the Fleet; it has been suggested that Kentish Town, which lies in between two forks of the Fleet, takes it takes name from cant or cantle (from the Middle English  meaning "corner"). 

Kenton<====>94136<====>Kenton    Kenton is an area in northwest London, England, partly in the London Borough of Harrow and partly in the London Borough of Brent.

In the valley below the village are the ruins of a complex of 3rd century AD Roman tombs and mausolea ( ) connected with the nearby 1st - 4th century AD Roman villa excavated 1967-1992 ( ). 

Rifling<====>94139<====>RiflingIn firearms, rifling is the helical groove pattern that is machined into the internal (bore) surface of a gun's barrel, for the purpose of exerting torque and thus imparting a spin to a projectile around its longitudinal axis during shooting.   This spin serves to gyroscopically stabilize the projectile by conservation of angular momentum, improving its aerodynamic stability and accuracy over smoothbore designs. Rifling is often described by its twist rate, which indicates the distance the rifling takes to complete one full revolution, such as "1 turn in 10 inches" (1:10 inches), or "1 turn in 254 mm" (1:254 mm).  A shorter distance indicates a "faster" twist, meaning that for a given velocity the projectile will be rotating at a higher spin rate.

Songwriter<====>94154<====>Songwriter  A songwriter is a professional who is paid to write lyrics and melodies for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music.  A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre.

Lagrange inversion theorem<====>94158<====>Lagrange inversion theoremIn mathematical analysis, the Lagrange inversion theorem, also known as the Lagrange–Bürmann formula, gives the Taylor series expansion of the inverse function of an analytic function. Theorem statementSuppose z is defined as a function of w by an equation of the form f(w) = z\, where f is analytic at a point a and f '(a) ≠ 0.  Then it is possible to invert or solve the equation for w in the form of a series,    w = a + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} g_n \frac{(z - f(a))^n}{n!}, where  g_n = \lim_{w \to a}\left[\frac{\mathrm{d}^{\,n-1}}{\mathrm{d}w^{\,n-1}}\left( \frac{w-a}{f(w) - f(a)} \right)^n\right].

For example, in twelve-tone equal temperament (the currently predominant system of musical tuning in Western music), the notes C  and D  are enharmonic (or enharmonically equivalent) notes.  Namely, they are the same key on a keyboard, and thus they are identical in pitch, although they have different names and different roles in harmony and chord progressions.

He waited alone in his shell,    which appeared as an egg spinning in the empty endless void of the time before the sky, before the earth, before the moon, before the sun, before the stars.

Exokernel<====>95757<====>Exokernel Exokernel is an operating system kernel developed by the MIT Parallel and Distributed Operating Systems group, and also a class of similar operating systems. Operating systems generally present hardware resources to applications through high-level abstractions such as (virtual) file systems.  The idea behind exokernels is to force as few abstractions as possible on application developers, enabling them to make as many decisions as possible about hardware abstractions.  Exokernels are tiny, since functionality is limited to ensuring protection and multiplexing of resources, which is considerably simpler than conventional microkernels' implementation of message passing and monolithic kernels' implementation of high-level abstractions. 

Atua<====>95758<====>Atua Atua are the gods and spirits of the Polynesian peoples such as the Māori or the Hawaiians.   The Polynesian word literally means power or strength and so the concept is similar to that of mana.   Today, it is also used for the monotheistic conception of God.  Especially powerful atua included:  5Rongo – god of agriculture and peaceTane – the creator of all living things such as animals, birds and treesTangaroa – god of the seaTu – the god of warWhiro – god of darkness and evilIn Samoa, where atua means "god" in the Samoan language,    traditional tattooing was based on the doctrine of tutelary spirits.

They often take the form of plants or animals, and are often more cruel than other gods.  These trouble-making gods are regarded as having come from Sāmoa.   The Tongan word tangi lau aitu means to cry from grief, to lament. In Māori mythology, the word aitu refers to sickness, calamity, or demons; the related word aituā means misfortune, accident, disaster.

Some, curious, climb into the basket and are quickly lifted up out of sight, never to return.  Amai-te-rangi has taken a liking to human flesh, and has invented the basket and its ropes as a way to satisfy his hunger.  He has also heard of the prowess of Ngaru and is determined to catch him (Gill 1876:234). ReferencesW. 

L4 microkernel family<====>95763<====>L4 microkernel familyL4 is a family of second-generation microkernels, generally used to implement Unix-like operating systems, but also used in a variety of other systems. L4, like its predecessor L3 microkernel, was created by German computer scientist Jochen Liedtke as a response to the poor performance of earlier microkernel-based operating systems.  Liedtke felt that a system designed from the start for high performance, rather than other goals, could produce a microkernel of practical use.  His original implementation in hand-coded Intel i386-specific assembly language code in 1993 sparked intense interest in the computer industry.   Since its introduction, L4 has been developed for platform independence and also in improving security, isolation, and robustness.

Their appearance in the eastern sky was the sign for planting to begin. 

Conjoined twins<====>95801<====>Conjoined twins  Conjoined twins are identical twins  joined in utero.  An extremely rare phenomenon, the occurrence is estimated to range from 1 in 49,000 births to 1 in 189,000 births, with a somewhat higher incidence in Southeast Asia and Africa.Approximately half are stillborn, and an additional one-third die within 24 hours.  Most live births are female, with a ratio of 3:1.(this article includes post-mortem images) Two contradicting theories exist to explain the origins of conjoined twins.  The more generally accepted theory is fission, in which the fertilized egg splits partially.

Leslie Phillips<====>95805<====>Leslie Phillips   Leslie Samuel Phillips, CBE (born 20 April 1924) is an English actor who came to prominence in films in the 1950s, acting as a suave charmer with an exaggerated upper class accent, in the style of Terry-Thomas.  After a notable success in the Carry On films and the Doctor series, he moved away from comedy into character roles in the Harry Potter series and many TV sitcoms, as well as stage work. Early lifeContrary to the impression given by his public persona, Phillips came from a background of poverty.  He was born in Tottenham, then in Middlesex, England, the son of Cecelia Margaret (née Newlove) and Frederick Samuel Phillips,  who worked at Glover and Main, manufacturers of cookers in Edmonton; the "filthy, sulphurous" air of the factory gave Frederick a weak heart and edema, leading to his death at the age of 44. 

Radiography<====>95807<====>Radiography  Radiography is an imaging technique using X-rays to view the internal structure of an object.  To create the image, a beam of X-rays, a form of electromagnetic radiation, are produced by an X-ray generator and are projected toward the object.  A certain amount of X-ray is absorbed by the object, dependent on its density and composition.  The X-rays that pass through the object are captured behind the object by a detector (either photographic film or a digital detector).  The generation of flat two dimensional images by this technique is called projectional radiography.  Computed tomography (CT scanning) is where multiple 2D images from different angles undergo computer processing to generate 3D representations. 

Tama-nui-te-rā<====>95808<====>Tama-nui-te-rāIn Māori mythology, Tama-nui-te-rā (Tamanuiterā) is the personification of the Sun.

FamilyIn some legends Tamanuiterā is the husband of Ārohirohi, goddess of mirages.  In other legends, Tamanuiterā had two wives, the Summer maid, Hineraumati, and the Winter maid, Hinetakurua.  The child of Tamanuiterā and Hineraumati, Tane-rore, is credited with the origin of dance. 

Huna (New Age)<====>95809<====>Huna (New Age) Huna is a Hawaiian word adopted by Max Freedom Long (1890–1971) in 1936 to describe his theory of metaphysics.  Long cited what he believed to be the spiritual practices of ancient Hawaiian kahunas (priests) as inspiration, however, the system is his invention, with roots in New Thought and Theosophy, rather than in traditional Hawaiian beliefs.  Huna is part of the New Age movement. HistoryMax Freedom Long, who was not Hawaiian, went to Hawaii in 1917 to work as an elementary school teacher.  He became interested in the religious beliefs and practices of the ancient kahunas and modern practitioners of traditional, indigenous Hawaiian religion, but none of the ceremonial people talked to him so he was unable to penetrate to the inner workings of this religion. 

Aumakua<====>95811<====>Aumakua In Hawaiian mythology, an ʻaumakua  ( ; often spelled aumakua) is a family god, often a deified ancestor.

Nā ʻaumākua were worshipped at localities (often rocks) where they were believed to "dwell".   The appearance of an animal one regarded as an ʻaumakua was often believed to be an omen (of good or ill).  There are also many stories of nā ʻaumākua (in animal form) intervening to save their descendants from harm. 

Year Without a Summer<====>95812<====>Year Without a Summer The year 1816 is known as the Year Without a Summer (also the Poverty Year, the Summer that Never Was, the Year There Was No Summer, and Eighteen Hundred and Froze To Death),    because of severe climate abnormalities that caused average global temperatures to decrease by 0. 4–0. 7 °C (0. 7–1. 3 °F).   This resulted in major food shortages across the Northern Hemisphere.  Evidence suggests that the anomaly was predominantly a volcanic winter event caused by the massive 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in the Dutch East Indies (the largest eruption in at least 1,300 years after the extreme weather events of 535–536), perhaps exacerbated by the 1814 eruption of Mayon in the Philippines.

Direct democracy<====>95816<====>Direct democracy  Direct democracy or pure democracy is a form of democracy in which people decide on policy initiatives directly.  This differs from the majority of most currently established democracies, which are representative democracies.

BiographyEarly lifeCarl Frederick Buechner, the eldest son of Katherine Kuhn and Carl Frederick Buechner Sr., was born on July 11, 1926 in New York City. Buechner Institute Biography. Buechnerinstitute.org. Retrieved on 2011-08-03.  During Buechner's early childhood the family moved frequently, as Buechner's father searched for work. In The Sacred Journey Buechner recalls: "Virtually every year of my life until I was fourteen, I lived in a different place, had different people to take care of me, went to a different school. The only house that remained constant was the one where my maternal grandparents lived in a suburb of Pittsburgh called East Liberty...Apart from that one house on Woodland Road, home was not a place to me when I was a child. It was people."  This changed in 1936, when Buechner's father committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning, a result of his conviction that he had been a failure.  Immediately afterwards, the family moved to Bermuda, where they remained until World War II forced the evacuation of Americans from the island.  In Bermuda, Buechner experienced "the blessed relief of coming out of the dark and unmentionable sadness of my father's life and death into fragrance and greenness and light."   Education and military serviceBuechner then attended the Lawrenceville School in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, graduating in 1943. While at Lawrenceville, he met the future Pulitzer Prize winning poet James Merrill; their friendship and rivalry inspired the literary ambitions of both.  As Mel Gussow wrote in Merrill's 1995 obituary: "their friendly competition was an impetus for each becoming a writer."  Buechner then enrolled at Princeton University. His college career was interrupted by military service in World War II (1944–46), but he returned to graduate with a degree in English in 1948. Upon graduation, he returned to the Lawrenceville School as a teacher of creative writing.Literary success and teachingDuring his senior year at Princeton, Buechner received the Irene Glascock Prize for poetry, and he also began working on his first novel and one of his greatest critical successes: A Long Day's Dying, published in 1950. Of this first book Buechner says,"I took the title from a passage in Paradise Lost where Adam says to Eve that their expulsion from Paradise "will prove no sudden but a slow pac'd evil,/ A Long Day's Dying to augment our pain," and with the exception of the old lady Maroo, what all the characters seem to be dying of is loneliness, emptiness, sterility, and such preoccupation with themselves and their own problems that they are unable to communicate with each other about anything that really matters to them very much. I am sure that I chose such a melancholy theme partly because it seemed effective and fashionable, but I have no doubt that, like dreams generally, it also reflected the way I felt about at least some dimension of my own life and the lives of those around me." The publication of A Long Day's Dying catapulted Buechner into early and, in his own words, "undeserved" fame. Buechner's dense, reflective style was compared to Henry James and Marcel Proust, and he was hailed as one of the rising stars of American literature.  In a long and distinguished career, A Long Day's Dying continues to be one of Buechner's most successful works, both critically and commercially (it was reissued in 2003). However, his second novel, The Season's Difference, published in 1952, in Buechner's words, "fared as badly as the first one had fared well."  The contrast between the success of his first novel and the commercial failure of the second was starkly visible, and it was on this note that Buechner left his teaching position at Lawrenceville to move to New York City and focus on his writing career.Path to ordinationIn 1952, Buechner began lecturing at New York University, and once again received critical acclaim for his short story "The Tiger," published in The New Yorker, which won the O. Henry Award in 1955. Also during this time, he began attending the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, where George Buttrick was pastor. It was during one of Buttrick's sermons that Buechner heard the words that inspired his ordination: Buttrick described the inward coronation of Christ as taking place in the hearts of those who believe in him "among confession, and tears, and great laughter." The impact of this phrase on Buechner was so great that he eventually entered the Union Theological Seminary in 1954, on a Rockefeller Brothers Theological Fellowship. While at Union, Buechner studied under such renowned theologians as Reinhold Niebuhr, Paul Tillich, and James Muilenberg, who helped Buechner in his search for understanding:"I wanted to learn about Christ – about the Old Testament, which had been his Bible, and the New Testament, which was the Bible about him; about the history of the church, which had been founded on the faith that through him God had not only revealed his innermost nature and his purpose for the world, but had released into the world a fierce power to draw people into that nature and adapt them to that purpose... No intellectual pursuit had ever aroused in me such intense curiosity, and much more than my intellect was involved, much more than my curiosity aroused. In the unfamiliar setting of a Presbyterian church, of all places, I had been moved to astonished tears which came from so deep inside me that to this day I have never fathomed them, I wanted to learn more about the source of those tears and the object of that astonishment." Buechner's decision to enter the seminary had come as a great surprise to those who knew him. Even George Buttrick, whose words had so inspired Buechner, observed that, "It would be a shame to lose a good novelist for a mediocre preacher."   Nevertheless, Buechner's ministry and writing have ever since served to enhance each other's message.Following his first year at Union, Buechner decided to take the 1955-6 school year off to continue his writing. In the spring of 1955, shortly before he left Union for the year, Buechner met his wife Judith at a dance given by some family friends. They were married a year later by James Muilenberg in Montclair, N.J., and spent the next four months traveling in Europe. During this year, Buechner also completed his third novel, The Return of Ansel Gibbs.After his sabbatical, Buechner returned to Union to complete the two further years necessary to receive a Bachelor of Divinity.  He was ordained on June 1, 1958 at the same Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church where he had heard George Buttrick preach four years earlier. Buechner was ordained as an evangelist, or minister without pastoral charge. Shortly before graduation, as he considered his future role as minister of a parish, he had received a letter from Robert Russell Wicks, formerly the Dean of the Chapel at Princeton, and now serving as school minister at Phillips Exeter Academy; Wicks had offered him the job of instituting a new, full-time religion department at Exeter. Buechner decided to take the opportunity to return to teaching, and to develop a program that taught religion in depth.ExeterIn September 1958, the Buechners moved to Exeter. There, Buechner faced the challenge of creating a new department and academically rigorous curriculum that would challenge the often cynical views of his new students. "My job, as I saw it, was to defend the Christian faith against its "cultured despisers," to use Schleiermacher's phrase. To put it more positively, it was to present the faith as appealingly, honestly, relevantly, and skillfully as I could."  During his tenure at Exeter, Buechner taught courses in both the Religion and English departments, and served as school chaplain and minister. Also during this time, the family grew to include three daughters. For the school year 1963-4, the Buechners took a sabbatical on their farm in Rupert, VT, during which time Buechner returned to his writing; his fourth book, The Final Beast, was published in 1965. As the first book he had written since being ordained, The Final Beast represented a new style for Buechner, one in which he combined his dual callings as minister and as author.Buechner recalls of his accomplishments at Exeter: "All told, we were there for nine years with one year's leave of absence tucked in the middle, and by the time we left, the religion department had grown from only one full-time teacher, namely myself, and about twenty students, to four teachers and something in the neighborhood, as I remember, of three hundred students or more."  Among these students was the future author John Irving, who included a quotation from Buechner in the preface of his book A Prayer for Owen Meany. One of Buechner's biographers, Marjorie Casebier McCoy, describes the effect of his time at Exeter as follows: "Buechner in his sermons had been attempting to reach out to the "cultured despisers of religion." The students and faculty at Phillips Exeter had been, for the most part, just that when he had arrived at the school, and it had been they who compelled him to hone his preaching and literary skills to their utmost in order to get a hearing for Christian faith." Vermont and the Alphabet of GraceAfter nine years at Exeter, and the successful establishment of the Religion Department, the Buechners felt that it was time for a change. In the summer of 1967, the whole family moved to their farmhouse in Rupert to live year-round. Buechner describes their house in Now and Then:"Our house is on the eastern slope of Rupert Mountain, just off a country road, still unpaved then, and five miles from the nearest town...Even at the most unpromising times of year – in mudtime, on bleak, snowless winter days – it is in so many unexpected ways beautiful that even after all this time I have never quite gotten used to it. I have seen other places equally beautiful in my time, but never, anywhere, have I seen one more so." There Buechner realized the challenge of writing without the structure of school life around him. He describes the creation of his next novel, The Entrance to Porlock, as follows: "...the labor of writing which was so painful that I find it hard, even now, to see beyond the memory of the pain to whatever merit it may have."  However, in 1968, Buechner received a letter from Charles Price, the chaplain at Harvard, inviting him to give the Noble Lectures series in the winter of 1969. His predecessors in this role were none other than Richard Niebuhr and George Buttrick, and Buechner was both flattered and daunted by the idea of joining so august a group. When he voiced his concerns, Price replied that he should write "something in the area of "religion and letters."" Now and Then, p. 86  Thence came the idea to write about the everyday events of life "as the alphabet through which God, of his grace, spells out his words, his meaning, to us. So The Alphabet of Grace was the title I hit upon, and what I set out to do was to try to describe a single representative day of my life in a way to suggest what there was of God to hear in it."  This process showed Buechner a way out of the frustration he had felt while writing The Entrance to Porlock: by drawing on his own experience, he found the means to convey his thoughts through his writing.Faith and fiction: The Book of Bebb, Godric, BrendanIt was about this time, when Buechner was giving the Noble Lectures, that he came across the character that proved so significant in his later career:"I was reading a magazine as I waited my turn at a barber shop one day when, triggered by a particular article and the photographs that went with it, there floated up out of some hitherto unexplored subcellar of me a character who was to dominate my life as a writer for the next six years and more. He was a plump, bald, ebullient southerner who had once served five years in a prison on a charge of exposing himself before a group of children and was now the head of a religious diploma mill in Florida and of a seedy, flat-roofed stucco church called the Church of Holy Love, Incorporated. He wore a hat that looked too small for him. He had a trick eyelid that every once in a while fluttered shut on him. His name was Leo Bebb." Now and Then, p. 97 The Book of Bebb tetralogy proved to be one of Buechner's most well-known works. Published in the years from 1972–1977, it brought Buechner to a much wider audience, and gained him critical acclaim (Lion Country, the first book in the series, was a finalist for the National Book Award in 1971). Of writing the series, Buechner says: "I had never known a man like Leo Bebb and was in most ways quite unlike him myself, but despite that, there was very little I had to do by way of consciously, purposefully inventing him. He came, unexpected and unbidden, from a part of myself no less mysterious and inaccessible than the part where dreams come from; and little by little there came with him a whole world of people and places that was as heretofore unknown to me as Bebb was himself."  In this series, Buechner experimented for the first time with first-person narrative, and discovered that this, too, opened new doors. His next work, Godric, published in 1980, was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Godric, a 12th-century English saint, tells his story in the first-person, and Buechner took great care to recreate the sounds and rhythm of his speech. "Godric came as mysteriously alive for me as Bebb had and, with him, all the people he knew and the whole medieval world he lived in. I had Godric narrate his own life, and despite the problem of developing a language that sounded authentic on his lips without becoming impenetrably archaic, and despite the difficulties of trying to recapture a time and place so unlike my own, the book, like Lion Country before it, came so quickly and with such comparative ease that there were times when I suspected that maybe the old saint himself was not entirely uninvolved in the process, as, were I a saint and were somebody writing a book about me, I would not be entirely uninvolved in the process either." In Brendan, published in 1987, Buechner once again drew inspiration from the life of a complex man of faith in a bygone era.  Experimenting further with the narrative technique Buechner employed to such dramatic effect in Godric, Brendan interweaves history and legend in an evocative portrayal of the sixth-century Irish saint as seen through the eyes of Finn, his childhood friend and loyal follower.  Buechner's colorful recreation of the Celtic world of fifteen hundred years ago earned him the Christianity and Literature Belles Lettres Prize in 1987.Buechner's Sacred Journey:  MemoirsThe process of writing Godric once again indicated a new path for Buechner: the writing of his own autobiography. To date, this includes four volumes: The Sacred Journey (1982), Now and Then (1983), Telling Secrets (1991), The Eyes of the Heart (1999). Buechner has thus far published over thirty works, and continues to write more; his latest book, Yellow Leaves, was released in 2008.In 2007, Buechner was presented with the lifetime achievement award from the Conference on Christianity and Literature. Buechner in BermudaFrederick Buechner's lifelong love affair with Bermuda began with his family's escape from the trauma of his father's suicide.  In Telling Secrets, Buechner described "the blessed relief of coming out of the dark and unmentionable sadness of my father's life and death into fragrance and greenness and light."  Bermuda was "a place where healing could happen in a way that perhaps would not have been possible anywhere else and to a degree that—even with all the endurance, will, courage we might have been able to muster had we stayed [in New Jersey]—I do not think we could ever have achieved on our own."    For a child who had never known familial stability even before his father's death, Bermuda became home.  As Buechner explained, "In that never-never land, that Oz of an island, where we had no roots, I found for the first time a sense of being rooted."   "All in all it seems to me, looking back, that I lived there with a greater sense of permanence than any place we had lived earlier." But for the young Buechner Bermuda was also a new world of "magic and mystery," his own personal Land of Oz.  It was Prospero's island from Shakespeare's The Tempest come to life in all its spellbinding wonder.  It was an island of "brightness and peace"  that enabled him finally to see those closest to him as "creatures of our own new legends,"  the place where he discovered a best friend in his younger brother, Jamie, as they fished off the terrace of their salmon colored house in Paget—The Moorings, flew kites over the water in the harbor, and braved the pedagogical oddities of the Warwick Academy.  It was on this island that was "more dreamlike than any other place I have known since or ever hope to know"  where, sitting beside the girl whose mouth turned up at the corners on a crumbling stone wall at Salt Kettle, Buechner first felt the "sweet panic and anguish" of Eros.  And so, for those magical years before the outbreak of World War II, Buechner lived like a "king" in Bermuda  "with a sense of the magic and mystery of things greater than I had ever experienced this side of Oz." Bermuda has been a part of Buechner's writing ever since, from the appearance in his first poetic dabblings at Princeton of the kites he and his classmates on the island flew on Good Friday  to the pivotal events he touchingly recounts in his soul-stirring memoirs.  Even the longings of his fictional characters whose recollections of the "gorgeous smell" of "cedar wood and kerosene stoves and sun-tan oil and horse" and the narrow-gauge trolley with the wicker armchairs    echo Buechner's own happy memories of his personal Land of Oz. Bermuda was also a key source of literary inspiration when Buechner wrote The Storm, which combined elements of Shakespeare's The Tempest with his knowledge of Bermudian life and social structures.  A key character in the book was reputedly based upon a socialite living in Hamilton in the 1980s. [citation needed]As the literary ambassador of pre-World War II Bermuda, Buechner offers readers a vivid guided tour of an enchanted time, recounting in exquisite detail its sights and sounds and smells and tastes:  cedar-laden, salt-sweet air; houses of sky blue and rose, lemon yellow and lavender, and pastel green; rain moving in curtains across the harbor; pale pink coral beaches; flat, sweet yellow buns; skies full of gulls; rum swizzles on the balcony at Twenty One; miles of coral roads, their chalky smell drying in the rain after a storm; the battered ferry chugging along with its stern nearly awash under a load of bicycles; the clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages, the carriages' fringed roofs, the chime of their bells.  For Buechner, this lush detail is all part of the "sense of another time that I will carry with me to the end of my time."   The images he internalized from those formative years in Bermuda—the "priest trudging down the sun-drenched Bermuda lane, and the man with the beard who met all the ships when they docked and searched all the faces"—would, over time, prove foundational to Buechner's faith as well.  Bermuda was, in a way, his family's salvation, "the promised land of pre-World War II Bermuda that we reached through the wilderness and bewilderness of our first shock and grief."  It was also a time in Buechner's life marked by intellectual, spiritual and emotional growth and exploration.  Bermuda is therefore central to Buechner's theology as he came to view his deliverance in that enchanting isle "as a gift that implies a giver," an example of that "crazy, holy grace" that sends us experiences not by mere accident of chance but to "open our hearts as well as our eyes."  It was in Bermuda that Buechner "caught some bright foreshadowing" of "the secret place of the Most High" that he believed "dwells in all of us as the image of God and in which . . . some part of all of us dwells."  This is why, when Buechner's character Rooney in The Final Beast is asked to pick one word to describe the power of Bermuda, she says "life  . . . .   It had the smell of life to me."  Buechner found a new life in Bermuda.   It marked a new beginning for him, emotionally and spiritually.  "In the midst of all that [the fields of Easter lilies and Bermuda onions, the white coral roads, the pink coral beaches, the aquamarine, turquoise and celery green of the Gulf Stream waters, the fragrant air], for me, everything that had come earlier vanished without a trace." In fact, despite the evocative imagery of Bermuda throughout Buechner's autobiographical work, his writing actually underrepresents the island's profound and lasting significance to him, in part because conveying the wonder of this magical world that so captivated his imagination, the feeling that has stayed with him all of his life of "living there and breathing that air," proved a difficult undertaking. The legacy of Buechner's time in Bermuda has, however, manifested in other respects in his writing and in his life.  While he often refers to the natural beauty of Bermuda's island landscape—the "unutterable, blinding blue-green flash of the ocean" and its "unkempt greenness" —and its idyllic island charms—the "narrow-gauge Toonerville Trolley of a railway with wicker armchairs for seats" and the pastel houses "with their blinding white roofs stepped to catch the rain" —the distinctly British flavor of pre-World War II Bermuda also instilled in him an enduring love of English custom and culture.  Amidst the sounds and textures Buechner recalls from his days in Bermuda, he writes of "the sound and feel of English money—the heavy coppers and florins and half crowns that weighed down your pockets, the thin little sixpences and threepenny bits, the pound notes with the King's picture on them."  Traces of the United Kingdom were all around him:  "I remember the public library with a park behind it where a British regiment called the Sherwood Foresters gave band concerts underneath a huge India rubber tree, and a bookstore that smelled the way a new book printed in England does when you first open it."    That smell, "faintly like nutmeg, dry, erudite," stayed with Buechner the rest of his life.    Details from the island's celebration of the coronation of George the Sixth—for which Buechner and his classmates "helped drag brushwood to the top of a hill for a bonfire"  and went around "lighting bonfires on all the hills in Bermuda" —appear throughout his memoirs.  Thus, in The Eyes of the Heart, Buechner recalls the "royal governor who on state occasions such as the coronation of George VI wore a cocked hat with white plumes on it like the captain of the Pinafore." Later this affinity for Great Britain prompted Buechner to make frequent sojourns and visits to the United Kingdom.  He cultivated profound, enduring, and mutually supportive relationships with prominent Britons.  He spoke regularly at Westminster Abbey and Salisbury and was friendly with former deans, The Very Rev. Michael Mayne (Westminster)  and The Very Rev. Hugh Dickinson (Salisbury).  In fact, his most recent collection, The Yellow Leaves, was dedicated to the memory of Michael Mayne and, with love, to his wife Allison.  In that work, Buechner expresses "the feeling that from the beginning I had had in England that in some sense I had come home, the feeling I had always had, in Westminster Abbey especially, that all the dead past enshrined there was far from dead in me." The literary imagination that first started to hum in Bermuda ultimately found in Great Britain the inspiration for some of Buechner's most influential and acclaimed works of fiction.  Buechner's Godric tells the story of Saint Godric of Finchale from the first-person perspective of the 12th-century English saint himself.  In this pivotal work, Buechner took great care to recreate the sounds and rhythm of Godric's speech.  This fictional retelling of the saint's life earned Buechner a Pulitzer Prize nomination and garnered the respect of critics in the United States and the United Kingdom.   In Brendan, Buechner returned to the fertile territory of early Christian mythology.  Again, Buechner painstakingly recreated a foregone era on the British Isles.Tributes and legacy  Frederick Buechner is among the most widely read contemporary Christian authors.  His popularity is attested by numerous awards and honorary degrees, and by the words of his many fans:"To this day, you've remained one of my best angels, and not just mine, but all of ours who, week after week, trust that our nicked and ragged selves, however hard we try to press them, will somehow serve to bring God's truth to life." Barbara Brown Taylor,The Art of the Sermon: a Tribute to Frederick Buechner. April 5, 2006 In 2001, Californian rock band, "Daniel Amos" released a double album titled "Mr. Buechner's Dream." The album contains over thirty songs and pays tribute to Frederick Buechner, "who has been a major inspiration on the band's lyrics for years." The C.D. version of the album contains a picture of Buechner holding a note which says "I enjoyed my dream."In the words of The Reverend Samuel Lloyd, former dean of Washington National Cathedral, Buechner's words "have nurtured the lives of untold seekers and followers" through "his capacity to see into the heart of every day." Reverend Samuel Lloyd,The Art of the Sermon: a Tribute to Frederick Buechner. April 5, 2006 Buechner's readers are intrigued and inspired by the confluence of genres within his works:"Buechner's theological efforts are never systematic treatises but instead short, highly literary productions in most of which he draws explicit links with fiction-writing generally and his own fiction in particular...Buechner's 1969 Noble Lectures at Harvard, published in 1970 as The Alphabet of Grace, comprise a slender volume which is one of his most important and revealing works. Here the intimate relationship Buechner sees among fiction, theology, and autobiography is first made clear and fully embodied; and the book itself is a thoroughly lyrical piece." Buechner's combination of literary style with approachable, universally applicable subject matter has, to many of his fans, revolutionized contemporary Christian literature: "In my view, Buechner is doing a distinctively new thing on the literary scene, writing novels that are theologically exciting without becoming propaganda, and doing theology with artistic style and imagination."  Buechner's earliest works, written before his entrance into Union Theological Seminary, were hailed as profoundly literary works, notable for their dense, descriptive style. Of his first novel, A Long Day's Dying, David Daiches wrote: "There is a quality of civilized perception here, a sensitive and plastic handling of English prose and an ability to penetrate to the evanescent core of a human situation, all proclaiming major talent."  From this promising beginning, however, it has been the application of Buechner's literary talent to theological issues that has continued to fascinate his audience:"Ever since the publication of A Long Day's Dying...Frederick Buechner has been one of our most interesting and least predictable writers. Others might have repeated their success or failures, but he has not. From the sophisticated urban world of that first book, through The Return of Ansel Gibbs with its world of politics and public affairs, to the private, half-haunted pastoral world of The Entrance to Porlock, he has created a series of novels of startlingly different moods and manners, people and places. The one constant has been the masterful use of great stylistic powers to organize and control his highly original and complex vision of life." Of his more recent style, the pastor and author Brian D. McLaren says:"I have no desire to analyze what makes Buechner's writing and preaching so extraordinary. Neither do I want to account for Bob Dylan's raspy mystique, the peculiar beauty of a rainbow trout in a riffle, or a thunderstorm's magnetic terror. I simply want to enjoy them. They all knock me out of analysis and smack me clear into pleasure and awe." Throughout Buechner's work his hallmark as a theologian and autobiographer is his regard for the appearance of the divine in daily life. By examining the day-to-day workings of his own life, Buechner seeks to find God's hand at work, thus leading his audience by example to similar introspection. The Reverend Samuel Lloyd describes his "capacity to see into the heart of every day," an ability that reflects the significance of daily events onto the reader's life as well.  In the words of the preacher Barbara Brown Taylor: "From [Buechner] I've learned that the only limit to the revelation going on all around me is my willingness to turn aside and look." Buechner Writer's Workshop at PrincetonPrinceton Theological Seminary hosts an annual Buechner Writing Workshop. The workshop is designed to "encourage, educate, and inspire writers to communicate their Christian faith with clarity and power in the tradition of Frederick Buechner." Speakers at the 2015 workshop include authors Barbara Brown Taylor, Rachel Held Evans, and Philip Gulley, and President of Princeton, Dr. M. Craig Barnes. In 2016, authors Philip Yancey and Kathleen Norris will speak and lead sessions.The Buechner Institute at King UniversityInaugurated in 2008 at King University, the former King College, the Buechner Institute was dedicated to the work and example of Frederick Buechner, exploring the intersections and collisions of faith and culture that define our times.Dale Brown, the founding director of the Buechner Institute, was the author of numerous articles and the recent critical biography, The Book of Buechner: A Journey Through His Writings.The Buechner Institute sponsored convocations on most Mondays at 9:15 a.m. in Memorial Chapel on the campus of King University that featured speakers from a variety of backgrounds who examined the ways in which faith informs art and public life and cultivate conversation about what faith has to do with books, politics, social discourse, music, visual arts, and more.Additionally, the Buechner Institute sponsored the Annual Buechner Lecture. The following is the list of lecturers invited to speak thus far:2008: Frederick Buechner (inaugural lecture)2009: Barbara Brown Taylor2010: Ron Hansen2011: Katherine Paterson2012: Marilynne Robinson2013: Kathleen Norris (poet)A summer symposium on the work of Frederick Buechner, Buechnerfest, was featured in 2010 and 2012.  Attendees from around the country spent a week of reading and entertainment on the Virginia/Tennessee border.The work of the Institute was guided by a local Governing Board and a National Advisory Board. National board members included Doris Betts, Walter Brueggemann, Scott Cairns, Michael Card, Elizabeth Dewberry, Tim Gautreaux, Philip Gulley, Ron Hansen, Roy Herron, Silas House, Richard Hughes, Thomas G. Long, Tom Lynch, Brian McLaren, Carrie Newcomer, Kathleen Norris, Katherine Paterson, Eugene H. Peterson, Charles Pollard, Barbara Brown Taylor, Will Willimon, John Wilson, Philip Yancey, Doug Worgul, and others.In 2015, following the untimely death of Dr. Dale Brown, founding director of the Buechner Institute, and for reasons not entirely known, the Buechner family decided to no longer honor the gentlemen's agreement between Brown and Frederick Buechner that allowed the Institute to use the Buechner name. The University subsequently renamed its entity the Institute of Faith and Culture.In the mediaBuechner's work has been praised highly by many reviewers of books, with the distinct exception of his second novel, The Season's Difference, which was universally panned by critics and remains his biggest commercial flop. His later novels, including the Book of Bebb series and Godric, received hearty praise; in his 1980 review of Godric, Benjamin DeMott summed up a host of positive reviews, saying "All on his own, Mr. Buechner has managed to reinvent projects of self-purification and of faith as piquant matter for contemporary fiction, producing in a single decade a quintet of books each of which is individual in concerns and knowledge, and notable for literary finish."  In 1982, author Reynolds Price greeted Buechner's The Sacred Journey as "a rich new vein for Buechner – a kind of detective autobiography" and "[t]he result is a short but fascinating and, in its own terms, beautifully successful experiment." Buechner has occasionally been accused of being too "preachy;" a 1984 review by Anna Shapiro in the New York Times notes "But for all the colloquialism, there is something, well, preachy and a little unctuous about making yourself an exemplar of faith. Insights that would do for a paragraph are dragged out with a doggedness that will presumably bring the idea home to even the most resistant and inattentive."  The sentiments expressed by Cecelia Holland's 1987 Washington Post review of Buechner's novel, Brendan, are far more common. She writes,"In our own time, when religion is debased, an electronic game show, an insult to the thirsty soul, Buechner's novel proves again the power of faith, to lift us up, to hold us straight, to send us on again." In 2008, the 50th anniversary of Buechner's ordination, Rich Barlowe wrote of Buechner in the Boston Globe, "Who knows? The words are Frederick Buechner's mantra. Over the course of an hourlong chat with the writer and Presbyterian minister in his kitchen, they recur any number of times in response to questions about his faith and theology. Dogmatic religious believers would dismiss the two words as the warning shot of doubt. But for Buechner, it is precisely our doubts and struggles that mark us as human. And that insight girds his theological twist on Socrates: The unexamined human life is a lost chance to behold the divine."  In 2002, Richard Kauffman interviewed Buechner for The Christian Century upon the publication of Speak What We Feel (Not What We Ought to Say). Buechner answered the question "Do you envision a particular audience when you write?" by saying "I always hope to reach people who don't want to touch religion with a ten-foot pole. The cultured despisers of religion, Sehleiermacher called them. Maybe some of my books reach them. But most of my readers, as far as I can tell, aren't that type. Many of them are ministers. They say, 'You've given us something back we lost and opened up doors we didn't think could be opened for people.'" Buechner has also played literary critic himself. In 1980 Buechner reviewed Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth by J. R. R. Tolkien, noting that the book was "in short, a production less of Tolkien himself than of the Tolkien industry."

Maxwell's demon<====>96558<====>Maxwell's demon In the philosophy of thermal and statistical physics, Maxwell's demon is a thought experiment created by the physicist James Clerk Maxwell in which he suggested how the second law of thermodynamics might hypothetically be violated.   In the thought experiment, a demon controls a small door between two chambers of gas.  As individual gas molecules approach the door, the demon quickly opens and shuts the door so that fast molecules pass into the other chamber, while slow molecules remain in the first chamber.  Because faster molecules are hotter, the demon's behavior causes one chamber to warm up as the other cools, thus decreasing entropy and violating the second law of thermodynamics.

Dauphiné<====>96620<====>Dauphiné {{Infobox settlement   }}The Dauphiné (  or  ;  ) or Dauphiné Viennois, formerly Dauphiny in English,  is a former province in southeastern France, whose area roughly corresponded to that of the present departments of Isère, Drôme, and Hautes-Alpes.  The Dauphiné was originally the County of Albon. In the 12th century, the local ruler Count Guigues IV of Albon (c. 1095–1142) bore a dolphin on his coat of arms and was nicknamed "le Dauphin" (French for dolphin).  His descendants changed their title from Count of Albon to Dauphin of Viennois.  The state took the name of Dauphiné.

S.  state of Arizona.  As of the 2010 census, its population was 10,031.    Sedona's main attraction is its array of red sandstone formations.

Offspring<====>96628<====>Offspring  In biology, offspring are the young born of living organisms, produced either by a single organism or, in the case of sexual reproduction, two organisms.  Collective offspring may be known as a brood or progeny in a more general way.  This can refer to a set of simultaneous offspring, such as the chicks hatched from one clutch of eggs, or to all the offspring, as with the honeybee. Human offspring (descendants) are referred to as children (without reference to age, thus one can refer to a parent's "minor children" or "adult children" or "infant children" or "teenage children" depending on their age); male children are sons and female children are daughters (see kinship and descent).

Confidence trick<====>96637<====>Confidence trick   A confidence trick (synonyms include confidence game, confidence scheme, ripoff, scam and stratagem) is an attempt to defraud a person or group after first gaining their confidence, used in the classical sense of trust.  Confidence tricks exploit characteristics of the human psyche, such as credulity, naïveté, compassion, vanity, irresponsibility, and greed. TerminologyThe perpetrator of a confidence trick (or "con trick") is often referred to as a confidence (or "con") man, con-artist, or a " ".  Samuel Thompson (1821–1856) was the original "confidence man. " Thompson was a clumsy swindler who asked his victims to express confidence in him by giving him money or their watch rather than gaining their confidence in a more nuanced way.

Chichester Cathedral<====>96643<====>Chichester Cathedral   Chichester Cathedral, formally known as the Cathedral Church of the Holy Trinity, is the seat of the Anglican Bishop of Chichester.  It is located in Chichester, in Sussex, United Kingdom.  It was founded as a cathedral in 1075, when the seat of the bishop was moved from Selsey.  Tim Tatton-Brown and John Crook, The English Cathedral, New Holland (2002),   Chichester Cathedral has fine architecture in both the Norman and the Gothic styles, and has been called by the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner "the most typical English Cathedral".   Despite this, Chichester has two architectural features that are unique among England's medieval cathedrals—a free-standing medieval bell tower (or campanile) and double aisles.

Seahorse<====>96652<====>SeahorseSeahorse (also written sea-horse and sea horse) is the name given to 54 species of small marine fishes in the genus Hippocampus.  "Hippocampus" comes from the Ancient Greek word hippos ( , híppos) meaning "horse" and kampos ( , kámpos) meaning "sea monster".Having a head and neck suggestive of a horse, seahorses also feature segmented bony armour, an upright posture and a curled prehensile tail.  HabitatSeahorses are mainly found in shallow tropical and temperate waters throughout the world, from about 45°S to 45°N   and live in sheltered areas such as seagrass beds, estuaries, coral reefs, or mangroves.

Falaise, Calvados<====>96654<====>Falaise, Calvados  Falaise is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. GeographyFalaise lies on the river Ante, a tributary of the river Dives, about    southeast of Caen. HistoryThe area around Falaise has been inhabited from prehistoric times but it wasn't until the end of the prehistoric period and the beginning of the Gallo-Roman era that the area, and Falaise in particular, was regularly inhabited.   Evidence of settlement from this time has been found at Vaston, an agricultural area just north-east of the modern town. Falaise as it is sited today, probably came into being around the castle.

Cytochrome c oxidase<====>96842<====>Cytochrome c oxidase The enzyme cytochrome c oxidase or Complex IV,   is a large transmembrane protein complex found in bacteria and the mitochondrion of eukaryotes. It is the last enzyme in the respiratory electron transport chain of mitochondria (or bacteria) located in the mitochondrial (or bacterial) membrane.  It receives an electron from each of four cytochrome c molecules, and transfers them to one oxygen molecule, converting molecular oxygen to two molecules of water.  In the process, it binds four protons from the inner aqueous phase to make water and in addition translocates four protons across the membrane, in the process, helping to establish a transmembrane difference of proton electrochemical potential that the ATP synthase then uses to synthesize ATP. 

Small population size<====>96845<====>Small population size Small populations can behave differently from larger populations.  They are often the result of a population bottlenecks from larger populations, leading to reduced genetic diversity and loss or fixation of alleles and shifts in allele frequencies.   A small population is then more susceptible to demographic and genetic stochastic events, which can impact the long-term survival of the population.  Therefore, small populations are often considered at risk of endangerment or extinction, and are often of conservation concern. Demographic effectsThe influence of stochastic variation in demographic (reproductive and mortality) rates is much higher for small populations than large ones.

Pitch pipe<====>96914<====>Pitch pipeA pitch pipe is a small device used to provide a pitch reference for musicians without absolute pitch.  Although it may be described as a musical instrument, it is not typically used to play music as such.  Technically, it is a harmonica; however, it lacks many characteristics of harmonicas. OriginsThe earliest pitch pipes were instruments rather like a recorder, but rather than finger holes, they had a plunger like a slide whistle's (also known as a swanee whistle).  The pipe was generally made of wood with a square bore, and the plunger was leather-coated.  On this plunger are marked the notes of either the chromatic scale or the diatonic scale, and by setting it to the correct position, the indicated note will be produced when the instrument is blown.

Depth-first search<====>97034<====>Depth-first search   Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.  One starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. A version of depth-first search was investigated in the 19th century by French mathematician Charles Pierre Trémaux  as a strategy for solving mazes.   PropertiesThe time and space analysis of DFS differs according to its application area.  In theoretical computer science, DFS is typically used to traverse an entire graph, and takes time Θ(|V| + |E|),  linear in the size of the graph.

Succinic acid<====>97039<====>Succinic acid Succinic acid ( )  is a dicarboxylic acid with the chemical formula (CH 2 ) 2 (CO 2 H) 2 .    The name derives from Latin succinum, meaning amber.  In living organisms, succinic acid takes the form of an anion, succinate, which has multiple biological roles as a metabolic intermediate being converted into fumarate by the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase in complex 2 of the electron transport chain which is involved in making ATP, and as a signaling molecule reflecting the cellular metabolic state.   Succinate is generated in mitochondria via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), an energy-yielding process shared by all organisms.

Leghemoglobin<====>97057<====>LeghemoglobinLeghemoglobin (also leghaemoglobin or legoglobin) is a nitrogen or oxygen carrier and hemoprotein found in the nitrogen-fixing root nodules of leguminous plants.  It is produced by legumes in response to the roots being colonized by nitrogen-fixing bacteria, termed rhizobia, as part of the symbiotic interaction between plant and bacterium: roots not colonized by Rhizobium do not synthesise leghemoglobin.  Leghemoglobin has close chemical and structural similarities to hemoglobin, and, like hemoglobin, is red in colour.  The holoprotein (protein + heme cofactor) is widely believed to be a product of both plant and the bacterium in which the apoprotein is produced by the plant and the heme (an iron atom bound in a porphyrin ring) is produced by the bacterium.

Primary nutritional groups<====>97112<====>Primary nutritional groups Primary nutritional groups are groups of organisms, divided in relation to the nutrition mode according to the sources of energy and carbon, needed for living, growth and reproduction.  The sources of energy can be light and organic or inorganic compounds; the sources of carbon can be of organic or inorganic origin.  The terms aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration and fermentation do not refer to primary nutritional groups, but simply reflect the different use of possible electron acceptors in particular organisms, such as O 2  in aerobic respiration, or nitrate (NO 3  − ), sulfate (SO 4  2− ) or fumarate in anaerobic respiration, or various metabolic intermediates in fermentation. 

Heterotroph<====>97114<====>HeterotrophA heterotroph ( ;  Ancient Greek ἕτερος héteros = “other” plus trophe = "nutrition") is an organism that ingests or absorbs organic carbon  (rather than fix carbon from inorganic sources such as carbon dioxide) in order to be able to produce energy and synthesize compounds to maintain its life.  Ninety-five percent or more of all types of living organisms are heterotrophic, including all animals and fungi and some bacteria and protists.  "How Cells Harvest Energy".  McGraw-Hill Higher Education.   The term heterotroph arose in microbiology in 1946 as part of a classification of microorganisms based on their type of nutrition.

Port<====>97169<====>Port A port is a maritime commercial facility which may comprise one or more wharves where ships may dock to load and discharge passengers and cargo.  Although usually situated on a sea coast or estuary, some ports, such as Hamburg, Manchester and Duluth, are many miles inland, with access from the sea via river or canal. Today, by far the greatest growth in port development is in Asia, the continent with some of the world's largest and busiest ports, such as Singapore and the Chinese ports of Shanghai and Ningbo-Zhoushan.  Ancient ports Whenever ancient civilisations engaged in maritime trade, they tended to develop sea ports.

Wide-angle X-ray scattering<====>97193<====>Wide-angle X-ray scattering Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) or wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD)  is an X-ray-diffraction  technique that is often used to determine the crystalline structure of polymers.  This technique specifically refers to the analysis of Bragg peaks scattered to wide angles, which (by Bragg's law) implies that they are caused by sub-nanometer-sized structures.  Wide-angle X-ray scattering is the same technique as small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) only the distance from sample to the detector is shorter and thus diffraction maxima at larger angles are observed.  Depending on the measurement instrument used it is possible to do WAXS and SAXS in a single run (small- and wide-angle scattering, SWAXS).

Sobek was also associated with pharaonic power, fertility, and military prowess, but served additionally as a protective deity with apotropaic qualities, invoked particularly for protection against the dangers presented by the Nile river. HistorySobek enjoyed a longstanding presence in the ancient Egyptian pantheon, from the Old Kingdom (c. 

Jah<====>97293<====>Jah Jah or Yah (   Yah) is a short form of Yahweh (in consonantal spelling YHWH  , called the Tetragrammaton), the proper name of God in the Hebrew Bible.  Abbreviated Tetragrammaton in the Jewish Encyclopedia.   This short form of the name occurs 50 times in the text of the Hebrew Bible, of which 24 form part of the phrase "Hallelujah". In an English-language context, the name Jah is now most commonly associated with the Rastafari.  It is otherwise mostly limited to the phrase Hallelujah and theophoric names such as Elijah. In the King James Version (1611) there is only a single instance of JAH  (capitalised), in Psalm 68:4. 

Iah<====>97294<====>Iah  Iah ( Egyptian: Jˁḥ, transliterated as Yah, Jah, Jah(w), Joh or Aah  ) is a lunar deity in ancient Egyptian religion.  His name simply means "Moon".  By the New Kingdom, he was less prominent than other gods with lunar connections, Thoth and Khonsu.  As a result of the functional connection between them he could be identified with either of those deities.  He was sometimes considered an adult form of Khonsu and was increasingly absorbed by him.  Iah continued to appear in amulets and occasional other representations, similar to Khonsu in appearance, with the same lunar symbols on his head and occasionally the same tight garments. 

Senet<====>97295<====>Senet Senet (or Senat ) is a board game from ancient Egypt whose original rules are the subject of conjecture.  The oldest hieroglyph resembling a senet game dates to around 3100 BC.  In Search of the Meaning of Senet   by Peter A.  Piccione  The full name of the game in Egyptian is thought to have been zn. t n. t ḥˁb, meaning the "game of passing".    HistorySenet is one of the oldest known board games.  Fragmentary boards that could be senet have been found in First Dynasty burials in Egypt,  c. 

Hapi (Nile god)<====>97301<====>Hapi (Nile god)  Hapi was the god of the annual flooding of the Nile in ancient Egyptian religion.  The flood deposited rich silt (fertile soil) on the river's banks, allowing the Egyptians to grow crops.  Wilkinson, p. 106  Hapi was greatly celebrated among the Egyptians.  Some of the titles of Hapi were, Lord of the Fish and Birds of the Marshes and Lord of the River Bringing Vegetation.  Hapi is typically depicted as an intersex person with a large belly and pendulous breasts, wearing a loincloth and ceremonial false beard.  Wilkinson, p. 107 MythologyThe annual flooding of the Nile occasionally was said to be the Arrival of Hapi. 

Intel 8085<====>97302<====>Intel 8085   The Intel 8085 ("eighty-eighty-five") is an 8-bit microprocessor produced by Intel and introduced in 1976.   It is a software-binary compatible with the more-famous Intel 8080 with only two minor instructions added to support its added interrupt and serial input/output features.  However, it requires less support circuitry, allowing simpler and less expensive microcomputer systems to be built. The "5" in the part number highlighted the fact that the 8085 uses a single +5-volt (V) power supply by using depletion-mode transistors, rather than requiring the +5 V, −5 V and +12 V supplies needed by the 8080.  This capability matched that of the competing Z80, a popular 8080-derived CPU introduced the year before. 

Duamutef<====>97304<====>Duamutef  In ancient Egyptian religion, Duamutef is one of the Four Sons of Horus  and a protection god of the canopic jars.   Commonly he is said to be the son of the god Horus the Elder.  There is another myth that describes Duamutef and his brothers as sons of Osiris.  According to this myth, they were born from a lily flower that arose from the primaeval ocean. DefinitionThe name Duamutef means "He who adores his mother".  In war the most significant cause of death was from injuries in the torso and stomach.  The deity protecting this organ was associated with death by war, gaining the name Duamutef meaning 'adoring his motherland'. 

Mesta<====>97305<====>Mesta  The Mesta (Spanish: Honrado Concejo de la Mesta, literally "Honorable Council of the Mesta") was a powerful association of sheep ranchers in the medieval Crown of Castile. The sheep were transhumant, migrating from the pastures of Extremadura and Andalusia to León and Castile and back according to the season. The no-man's-land (up to 100 km across) between the Christian-controlled north and Moorish-controlled south was too insecure for arable farming and was only exploited by shepherds.  When the Christians conquered the south, farmers began to settle in the grazing lands, and disputes with pastoralists were common.  The Mesta, set up in the late 13th century,  can be regarded as the first, and most powerful, agricultural union in medieval Europe. 

Imset<====>97308<====>Imset  In Egyptian mythology, Imset (also transcribed Imseti, Amset, Amsety, Mesti, and Mesta) is a funerary deity, one of the Four sons of Horus, who are associated with the canopic jars,  specifically the one that contained the liver.   Because the Egyptians saw the liver as the seat of human emotion, the depiction of Imset was, unlike his brothers, not associated with any animal but always depicted as  a mummified human.  Isis is considered his protector, and is himself considered patron of the direction of the south. In ancient Egypt, the liver was thought to be the seat of emotion.

Only   are shown, since due to rule (2) below any other m can be reduced modulo n. Quadratic residues are highlighted in yellow — note that no entry with a Jacobi symbol of −1 is a quadratic residue, and if m is a quadratic residue modulo a coprime n, then  , but not all entries with a Jacobi symbol of 1 (see the   row) are quadratic residues. Notice also that when either n or m is a square, all values are nonnegative.   The Jacobi symbol is a generalization of the Legendre symbol. Introduced by Jacobi in 1837,  it is of theoretical interest in modular arithmetic and other branches of number theory, but its main use is in computational number theory, especially primality testing and integer factorization; these in turn are important in cryptography.DefinitionFor any integer a and any positive odd integer n, the Jacobi symbolis defined as the product of the Legendre symbols corresponding to the prime factors of n: \left(\frac{a}{n}\right) = \left(\frac{a}{p_1}\right)^{\alpha_1}\left(\frac{a}{p_2}\right)^{\alpha_2}\cdots \left(\frac{a}{p_k}\right)^{\alpha_k}, where n=p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2}\cdots p_k^{\alpha_k} is the prime factorization of n.The Legendre symbolis defined for all integers a and all odd primes p by \left(\frac{a}{p}\right) = \left\\begin{array}{rl}0 & \text{if } a \equiv 0 \pmod{p},\\1 & \text{if } a \not\equiv 0\pmod{p} \text{ and for some integer } x\colon\;a\equiv x^2\pmod{p},\\-1 & \text{if } a \not\equiv 0\pmod{p} \text{ and there is no such } x.\end{array}\right. Following the normal convention for the empty product,= 1.The Legendre and Jacobi symbols are indistinguishable exactly when the lower argument is an odd prime, in which case they have the same value.Table of valuesThe following is a table of values of Jacobi symbolwith n ≤ 59, k ≤ 30, n odd.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 1  1 1 1  1 1 1 1 1  1 1 1 1 1 1 1  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  1 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 5 1 −1 −1 1 0 1 −1 −1 1 0 1 −1 −1 1 0 1 −1 −1 1 0 1 −1 −1 1 0 1 −1 −1 1 0 7 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 0 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 0 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 0 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 0 1 1 9 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 11 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 0 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 0 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 13 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 1 0 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 1 0 1 −1 1 1 15 1 1 0 1 0 0 −1 1 0 0 −1 0 −1 −1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 −1 1 0 0 −1 0 −1 −1 0 17 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 1 0 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 19 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 0 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 21 1 −1 0 1 1 0 0 −1 0 −1 −1 0 −1 0 0 1 1 0 −1 1 0 1 −1 0 1 1 0 0 −1 0 23 1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 0 1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 25 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 27 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 29 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 −1 1 0 1 31 1 1 −1 1 1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 33 1 1 0 1 −1 0 −1 1 0 −1 0 0 −1 −1 0 1 1 0 −1 −1 0 0 −1 0 1 −1 0 −1 1 0 35 1 −1 1 1 0 −1 0 −1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 −1 −1 0 0 −1 −1 −1 0 −1 1 0 1 0 37 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 1 39 1 1 0 1 1 0 −1 1 0 1 1 0 0 −1 0 1 −1 0 −1 1 0 1 −1 0 1 0 0 −1 −1 0 41 1 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 43 1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 −1 1 1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 45 1 −1 0 1 0 0 −1 −1 0 0 1 0 −1 1 0 1 −1 0 1 0 0 −1 −1 0 0 1 0 −1 1 0 47 1 1 1 1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 49 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 51 1 −1 0 1 1 0 −1 −1 0 −1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 −1 1 0 1 −1 0 −1 1 0 53 1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 55 1 1 −1 1 0 −1 1 1 1 0 0 −1 1 1 0 1 1 1 −1 0 −1 0 −1 −1 0 1 −1 1 −1 0 57 1 1 0 1 −1 0 1 1 0 −1 −1 0 −1 1 0 1 −1 0 0 −1 0 −1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 1 0 59 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 1 1 −1 PropertiesThe following facts, even the reciprocity laws, are straightforward deductions from the definition of the Jacobi symbol and the corresponding properties of the Legendre symbol. The Jacobi symbol is defined only when the upper argument ("numerator") is an integer and the lower argument ("denominator") is a positive odd integer.1. If n is (an odd) prime, then the Jacobi symbolis equal to (and written the same as) the corresponding Legendre symbol.2. If  , then=    .3.  \left(\frac{a}{n}\right) = \begin{cases}0 & \text{if } \gcd(a,n) \ne 1,\\\pm1 & \text{if } \gcd(a,n) = 1.\end{cases} If either the top or bottom argument is fixed, the Jacobi symbol is a completely multiplicative function in the remaining argument:4.  \left(\frac{ab}{n}\right) = \left(\frac{a}{n}\right)\left(\frac{b}{n}\right),\quad\text{so } \left(\frac{a^2}{n}\right) = 1 \text{ or } 0. 5.  \left(\frac{a}{mn}\right)=\left(\frac{a}{m}\right)\left(\frac{a}{n}\right),\quad\text{so } \left(\frac{a}{n^2}\right) = 1 \text{ or } 0. The law of quadratic reciprocity: if m and n are odd positive coprime integers, then6.  \left(\frac{m}{n}\right)\left(\frac{n}{m}\right) = (-1)^{\tfrac{m-1}{2}\cdot\tfrac{n-1}{2}} = \begin{cases}1 & \text{if } n \equiv 1 \pmod 4 \text{ or } m \equiv 1 \pmod 4,\\-1 & \text{if } n\equiv m \equiv 3 \pmod 4\end{cases}  and its supplements7.  \left(\frac{-1}{n}\right) = (-1)^\tfrac{n-1}{2} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if }n \equiv 1 \pmod 4,\\-1 & \text{if }n \equiv 3 \pmod 4,\end{cases} 8.  \left(\frac{2}{n}\right) = (-1)^\tfrac{n^2-1}{8} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if }n \equiv 1,7 \pmod 8,\\-1 & \text{if }n \equiv 3,5\pmod 8.\end{cases} Like the Legendre symbol:If     = −1 then a is a quadratic nonresidue modulo n.If a is a quadratic residue modulo n and gcd(a,n) = 1, then     = 1.But, unlike the Legendre symbol:If     = 1 then a may or may not be a quadratic residue modulo n.This is because for a to be a quadratic residue modulo n, it has to be a quadratic residue modulo every prime factor of n. However, the Jacobi symbol equals one if, for example, a is a non-residue modulo exactly two of the prime factors of n. Although the Jacobi symbol cannot be uniformly interpreted in terms of squares and non-squares, it can be uniformly interpreted as the sign of a permutation by Zolotarev's lemma.The Jacobi symbolis a Dirichlet character to the modulus n.Calculating the Jacobi symbolThe above formulas lead to an efficient    algorithm for calculating the Jacobi symbol, analogous to the Euclidean algorithm for finding the gcd of two numbers. (This should not be surprising in light of rule 2).Reduce the "numerator" modulo the "denominator" using rule 2.Extract any factors of 2 from the "numerator" using rule 4 and evaluate them using rule 8.If the "numerator" is 1, rules 3 and 4 give a result of 1. If the "numerator" and "denominator" are not coprime, rule 3 gives a result of 0.Otherwise, the "numerator" and "denominator" are now odd positive coprime integers, so we can flip the symbol using rule 6, then return to step 1.Example of calculationsThe Legendre symbolis only defined for odd primes p.  It obeys the same rules as the Jacobi symbol (i.e., reciprocity and the supplementary formulas forandand multiplicativity of the "numerator".)Problem: Given that 9907 is prime, calculate    .Using the Legendre symbol \begin{align}\left(\frac{1001}{9907}\right) &=\left(\frac{7}{9907}\right) \left(\frac{11}{9907}\right) \left(\frac{13}{9907}\right). \\\left(\frac{7}{9907}\right) &=-\left(\frac{9907}{7}\right) =-\left(\frac{2}{7}\right) =-1.\\\left(\frac{11}{9907}\right) &=-\left(\frac{9907}{11}\right) =-\left(\frac{7}{11}\right) =\left(\frac{11}{7}\right) =\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)=1.\\\left(\frac{13}{9907}\right) &=\left(\frac{9907}{13}\right) =\left(\frac{1}{13}\right)=1.\\\left(\frac{1001}{9907}\right) &=-1. \end{align} Using the Jacobi symbol \begin{align} \left(\frac{1001}{9907}\right) &=\left(\frac{9907}{1001}\right) =\left(\frac{898}{1001}\right) =\left(\frac{2}{1001}\right)\left(\frac{449}{1001}\right)=\left(\frac{449}{1001}\right)\\&=\left(\frac{1001}{449}\right) =\left(\frac{103}{449}\right) =\left(\frac{449}{103}\right) =\left(\frac{37}{103}\right) =\left(\frac{103}{37}\right) \\&=\left(\frac{29}{37}\right)  =\left(\frac{37}{29}\right) =\left(\frac{8}{29}\right) =\left(\frac{2}{29}\right)^3 =-1.\end{align} The difference between the two calculations is that when the Legendre symbol is used the "numerator" has to be factored into prime powers before the symbol is flipped. This makes the  calculation using the Legendre symbol significantly slower than the one using the Jacobi symbol, as there is no known polynomial-time algorithm for factoring integers. The number field sieve, the fastest known algorithm, requires O\left(e^{(\ln N)^\frac13(\ln\ln N)^\frac23\big(C+o(1)\big)}\right) operations  to factor n. See Cohen, p. 495  In fact, this is why Jacobi introduced the symbol.Primality testingThere is another way the Jacobi and Legendre symbols differ. If the Euler criterion formula is used modulo a composite number, the result may or may not be the value of the Jacobi symbol, and in fact may not even be −1 or 1. For example, \begin{align}\left(\frac{19}{45}\right) &= 1  &&\text{ and } & 19^\frac{45-1}{2} &\equiv  1\pmod{45}. \\\left(\frac{ 8}{21}\right) &= -1 &&\text{ but } &  8^\frac{21-1}{2} &\equiv  1\pmod{21}. \\\left(\frac{ 5}{21}\right) &= 1  &&\text{ but } &  5^\frac{21-1}{2} &\equiv 16\pmod{21}.\end{align} So if it is unknown whether a number n is prime or composite, we can pick a random number a, calculate the Jacobi symboland compare it with Euler's formula; if they differ modulo n, then n is composite; if they have the same residue modulo n for many different values of a, then n is "probably prime".This is the basis for the probabilistic Solovay–Strassen primality test and refinements such as the Baillie-PSW primality test and the Miller–Rabin primality test.As an indirect use, it is possible to use it as an error detection routine during the execution of the Lucas-Lehmer primality test which, even on modern computer hardware, can take weeks to complete when processing Mersenne numbers over  \begin{align}2^{77,232,917} - 1\end{align}  (the largest known Mersenne prime as of January 2018). In nominal cases, the Jacobi symbol: \begin{align}\left(\frac{s_i - 2}{M_p}\right) &= -1 & i \ne 0\end{align} This also holds for the final residue  \begin{align}s_{p-2}\end{align}  and hence can be used as a verification of probable validity. However, if an error occurs in the hardware, there is a 50% chance that the result will become 0 or 1 instead, and won't change with subsequent terms of  \begin{align}s\end{align}  (unless another error occurs and changes it back to -1).See alsoKronecker symbol, a generalization of the Jacobi symbol to all integers.Power residue symbol, a generalization of the Jacobi symbol to higher powers residues.Notes References   External linksCalculate Jacobi symbol shows the steps of the calculation.

Heh (god)<====>97315<====>Heh (god)  Ḥeḥ (also Huh, Hah, Hauh, Huah, Hahuh and Hehu ) was the personification of infinity or eternity in the Ogdoad in Egyptian mythology.  Wilkinson, Richard H.  (2003).  The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt.  Thames & Hudson.  p.  109  His name originally meant "flood", referring to the watery chaos that the Egyptians believed existed before the creation of the world.   The Egyptians envisioned this chaos as infinite, in contrast with the finite created world, so Heh personified this aspect of the primordial waters.   Heh's female counterpart was known as Hauhet, which is simply the feminine form of his name. 

Hathor<====>97317<====>Hathor  Hathor (  or  ;  Egyptian:  ; in  , meaning "mansion of Horus") Hathor and Thoth: two key figures of the ancient Egyptian religion, Claas Jouco Bleeker, pp.  22–102, BRILL, 1973,    is an ancient Egyptian goddess who personified the principles of joy, feminine love, and motherhood.   She was one of the most important and popular deities throughout the history of ancient Egypt.  Hathor was worshipped by royalty and common people alike.  In tomb paintings, she is often depicted as "Mistress of the West", welcoming the dead into the next life. 

Moral realism<====>97321<====>Moral realismMoral realism (also ethical realism or moral Platonism) is the position that ethical sentences express propositions that refer to objective features of the world (that is, features independent of subjective opinion), some of which may be true to the extent that they report those features accurately.  This makes moral realism a non-nihilist form of ethical cognitivism with an ontological orientation, standing in opposition to all forms of moral anti-realism and moral skepticism, including ethical subjectivism (which denies that moral propositions refer to objective facts), error theory (which denies that any moral propositions are true); and non-cognitivism (which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all). 

Ihy<====>97322<====>Ihy Ihy is a god in ancient Egyptian mythology who represents the ecstasy of playing the sistrum.  His name may mean "sistrum player", referring to his function, or "calf".  This is in allusion to his relationship with the cow goddess Hathor who was often said to be his mother.  Other goddesses might be called his mother, however, including Isis, Sekhmet, and Neith.  The god Horus is Ihy's father.  Ihy was depicted as a child holding a sistrum or as a nude child with his finger in his mouth.  He was worshiped alongside Horus and Hathor at Dendera. 

Plön<====>97327<====>Plön  Plön ( ) is the district seat of the Plön district in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, and has about 8,700 inhabitants.  It lies right on the shores of Schleswig-Holstein's biggest lake, the Great Plön Lake, as well as on several smaller lakes, touching the town on virtually all sides.  The town's landmark is Plön Castle, a chateau built in the 17th century on a hill overlooking the town. Plön has a grammar school with a 300-year history, and is home to a German Navy non-commissioned officer school and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology.  The town, nestled as it is in the hilly, wooded lake district of Holstein Switzerland (Holsteinische Schweiz), also has importance in the tourism industry. 

Maahes<====>97332<====>Maahes  Maahes (also spelled Mihos, Miysis, Mios, Maihes, or Mahes) (Greek: Μαχές, Μιχός, Μίυσις, Μίος, or Μάιχες) was an ancient Egyptian lion-headed god of war,    whose name means "he who is true beside her".  He was seen as the son of the Creator god Ptah, as well as the feline goddess (Bast in Lower Egypt or Sekhmet in Upper Egypt) whose nature he shared.  Maahes was a deity associated with war, protection, and weather, as well as that of knives, lotuses, and devouring captives.  His cult was centred in Taremu and Per-Bast. OriginThe first recorded reference to Maahes is from the New Kingdom.

Bes<====>97334<====>Bes   Bes ( ; also spelled as Bisu) and its feminine counterpart Beset are an Ancient Egyptian deity worshipped as a protector of households, and in particular, of mothers and children and childbirth.

In navy context NCOs of this rank were formally addressed as Herr/ Frau Maat also informally / short Maat. The sequence of ranks (top-down approach) in that particular group is as follows: Unteroffizier ohne Portepee OR-5a: Obermaat / (Heer/ Luftwaffe) StabsunteroffizierOR-5b: Seekadett / Fahnenjunker OR-5c:  Maat  / Unteroffizier The abbreviation "OR" stands for "Other Ranks / fr: sous-officiers et militaires du rang / ru:другие ранги, кроме офицероф"!   Equivalent in other NATO countries – Second-maître/ Tweede meester – Master Seaman/ Matelot-chefe classe – Desetnik – Sergent – Second-Maître – no equivalent – sergente – secondo capo – Sergeant – Kvartermester – Bosman – Primerio-subsargento/ Segundo-subsargento 	 – Cabo mayor – RN: no equivalent  – USN: Petty Officer Second ClassHistory The term is derived from the low German māt (comrade).

Maate were recruited among conscripts who volunteered to serve for a minimum of six years. After approximately four years they could expect to become Maat. Re-enlistment was common but in most specialisms the career options would end with achieving the rank of Obermaat; only after 18 years in service a promotion as supernumary Vizefeldwebel was possible, if there was a billet open. The 1914/15 naval budget included 7857 billets for Maate and 5237 for Obermaate. References

Spontaneous Music Ensemble<====>97611<====>Spontaneous Music Ensemble The Spontaneous Music Ensemble (SME) was a loose collection of free improvising musicians convened beginning in the mid-1960s by the late South London-based jazz drummer/trumpeter John Stevens and alto and soprano saxophonist Trevor Watts.

Saxophonist Evan Parker observed that Stevens had two basic rules: (1) If you can't hear another musician, you're playing too loud, and (2) if the music you're producing doesn't regularly relate to what you're hearing others create, why be in the group? This led to the development of what would jocularly become known as 'insect improv' -- music that tended to be very quiet, very intense, arrhythmic, and by and large atonal.

Slash has since released three solo albums: Slash (2010), featuring an array of famous guest musicians, and Apocalyptic Love (2012) and World on Fire (2014), recorded with his band, Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators. 

Robert Bolt<====>97782<====>Robert Bolt    Robert Oxton Bolt, CBE (15 August 1924 – 21 February 1995) was an English playwright and a two-time Oscar-winning screenwriter, known for writing the screenplays for Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago and A Man for All Seasons, the latter two of which won him the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. CareerHe was born in Sale, Cheshire.  At Manchester Grammar School his affinity for Sir Thomas More first developed.  He attended the University of Manchester, and, after wartime service in the RAF (1943–1946), the University of Exeter.  For many years he taught English and history at Millfield School and only became a full-time writer at the age of 33 when his play The Flowering Cherry was staged in London in 1958, with Celia Johnson and Ralph Richardson. 

Walrus ivory<====>97785<====>Walrus ivoryWalrus tusk ivory comes from two modified upper canines.  It is also known as morse.   The tusks of a Pacific walrus may attain a length of one meter.  Walrus teeth are also commercially carved and traded.  The average walrus tooth has a rounded, irregular peg shape and is approximately 5 cm in length. The tip of a walrus tusk has an enamel coating which is worn away during the animal's youth.  Fine longitudinal cracks, which appear as radial cracks in cross-section, originate in the cementum and penetrate the dentine.  These cracks can be seen throughout the length of the tusk. 

Fred Zinnemann<====>97787<====>Fred Zinnemann  Alfred Zinnemann (April 29, 1907 March 14, 1997) was an Austrian-born American film director.  He won four Academy Awards for directing films in various genres, including thrillers, westerns, film noir and play adaptations.  He made 25 feature films during his 50-year career. He was among the first directors to insist on using authentic locations and for mixing stars with civilians to give his films more realism.  Within the film industry, he was considered a maverick for taking risks and thereby creating unique films, with many of his stories being dramas about lone and principled individuals tested by tragic events. 

Peck<====>97792<====>Peck  A peck is an imperial and United States customary unit of dry volume,    equivalent to 2 dry gallons or 8 dry quarts or 16 dry pints (9. 09 (UK) or 8. 81 (US) liters).  Two pecks make a kenning (obsolete), and four pecks make a bushel.  Although the peck is no longer widely used, some produce, such as apples, is still often sold by the peck.  Despite being referenced in the well-known Peter Piper tongue twister, pickled peppers are so rarely sold by the peck  that any association between pickled peppers and the peck unit of measurement is considered humorous in nature. 

Jamie Lynn Spears<====>97803<====>Jamie Lynn Spears    Jamie Lynn Spears (born April 4, 1991) is an American actress, singer and songwriter.  The younger sister of recording artist Britney Spears, she is known for her role as Zoey Brooks on the Nickelodeon teen sitcom Zoey 101, on which she starred from 2005 to 2008. Spears became the subject of significant media attention and controversy in 2007, when she announced she was pregnant at age 16, effectively sending her career into hiatus.  In 2013, Spears launched a career in country music.  She released her debut single, "How Could I Want More", along with her debut EP, The Journey. 

Isaac Barrow<====>97805<====>Isaac Barrow  Isaac Barrow (October 1630 – 4 May 1677) was an English Christian theologian and mathematician who is generally given credit for his early role in the development of infinitesimal calculus; in particular, for the discovery of the fundamental theorem of calculus.   His work centered on the properties of the tangent; Barrow was the first to calculate the tangents of the kappa curve.  Isaac Newton was a student of Barrow's, and Newton went on to develop calculus in a modern form. BiographyBarrow was born in London.  He was the son of Thomas Barrow, a linen draper by trade. 

Jules Richard<====>97807<====>Jules RichardJules Richard (12 August 1862, Blet, Département Cher, – 14 October 1956, Châteauroux, Département Indre) was a French mathematician. Life and  worksRichard taught at the lycées of Tours, Dijon and Châteauroux.  He obtained his doctorate, at age of 39, from the Faculté des Sciences in Paris.  His thesis of 126 pages concerns Fresnel's wave-surface.  Richard worked mainly on the foundations of mathematics and geometry, relating to works by Hilbert, von Staudt and Méray. In a more philosophical treatise about the nature of axioms of geometry Richard discusses and rejects the following basic principles:(1) Geometry is founded on arbitrarily chosen axioms - there are infinitely many equally true geometries. 

Richard's paradox<====>97812<====>Richard's paradoxIn logic, Richard's paradox is a semantical antinomy of set theory and natural language first described by the French mathematician Jules Richard in 1905.  The paradox is ordinarily used to motivate the importance of distinguishing carefully between mathematics and metamathematics.  Kurt Gödel specifically cites Richard's antinomy as a semantical analogue to his syntactical incompleteness result in the introductory section of "On Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I".  The paradox was also a motivation of the development of predicative mathematics. DescriptionThe original statement of the paradox, due to Richard (1905), is strongly related to Cantor's diagonal argument on the uncountability of the set of real numbers. 

Carl Nielsen<====>97817<====>Carl Nielsen   Carl August Nielsen ( ; 9 June 1865 3 October 1931) was a Danish musician, conductor and violinist, widely recognized as his country's most prominent composer. Brought up by poor but musically talented parents on the island of Funen, he demonstrated his musical abilities at an early age.  He initially played in a military band before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886.  He premiered his Op.  1, Suite for Strings, in 1888, at the age of 23.  The following year, Nielsen began a 16-year stint as a second violinist in the prestigious Royal Danish Orchestra under the conductor Johan Svendsen, during which he played in Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff and Otello at their Danish premieres.

County Limerick<====>97827<====>County Limerick   County Limerick ( ) is a county in Ireland.  It is located in the province of Munster, and is also part of the Mid-West Region.  It is named after the city of Limerick.  Limerick City and County Council is the local council for the county.  The county's population at the 2016 census is 195,175 of which 94,192 live in Limerick City, the county capital. Geography and political subdivisionsLimerick borders four other counties: Kerry to the west, Clare to the north, Tipperary to the east and Cork to the south.  It is the fifth largest of Munster's six counties in size, and the second largest by population. 

Nuclear technology<====>97830<====>Nuclear technology Nuclear technology is technology that involves the nuclear reactions of atomic nuclei.  Among the notable nuclear technologies are nuclear reactors, nuclear medicine and nuclear weapons.  It is also used, among other things, in smoke detectors and gun sights. History and scientific backgroundDiscovery The vast majority of common, natural phenomena on Earth only involve gravity and electromagnetism, and not nuclear reactions.  This is because atomic nuclei are generally kept apart because they contain positive electrical charges and therefore repel each other. In 1896, Henri Becquerel was investigating phosphorescence in uranium salts when he discovered a new phenomenon which came to be called radioactivity. 

Melbourne Football Club<====>97831<====>Melbourne Football Club    The Melbourne Football Club, nicknamed the Demons, is a professional Australian rules football club, playing in the Australian Football League (AFL).  It is named after and based in the city of Melbourne, Victoria, and plays its home games at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). Melbourne is the world's oldest professional club of any football code.  The club's origins can be traced to an 1858 letter in which Tom Wills, captain of the Victoria cricket team, calls for the formation of a "foot-ball club" with its own "code of laws".  An informal Melbourne team played that winter and was officially formed in May 1859 when Wills and three other members codified "The Rules of the Melbourne Football Club"—the basis of Australian rules football. 

Zener diode<====>97835<====>Zener diode A Zener diode is a particular type of diode that, unlike a normal one, allows current to flow not only from its anode to its cathode, but also in the reverse direction, when the so-called "Zener voltage" is reached.  Zener diodes have a highly doped p-n junction.  Normal diodes will also break down with a reverse voltage but the voltage and sharpness of the knee are not as well defined as for a Zener diode.  Also normal diodes are not designed to operate in the breakdown region, but Zener diodes can reliably operate in this region.

Canine distemper<====>97839<====>Canine distemper  Canine distemper (sometimes termed hardpad disease) is a viral disease that affects a wide variety of animal families, including domestic and wild species of dogs, coyotes, foxes, pandas, wolves, ferrets, skunks, raccoons, and large cats, as well as pinnipeds, some primates, and a variety of other species.  It was long believed that animals in the family Felidae, including many species of large cat as well as domestic cats, were resistant to canine distemper, until some researchers reported the prevalence of CDV infection in large felids.It is now known that both large Felidae and domestic cats can be infected, usually through close housing with dogsor possibly blood transfusion from infected cats,  but such infections appear to be self-limiting and largely without symptoms. 

Pressure frying<====>97841<====>Pressure fryingIn cooking, pressure frying is a variation on pressure cooking where meat and cooking oil are brought to high temperatures while pressure is held high enough to cook the food more quickly.  This leaves the meat very hot and juicy.  A receptacle used in pressure frying is known as a pressure fryer. The process is most notable for its use in the preparation of fried chicken in many commercial fried chicken restaurants. Pressure frying is mostly done in industrial kitchens.  Ordinary pressure cookers are generally unsuitable for pressure frying, because they are typically designed for a maximum temperature around 121 °C (250 °F) whereas oil can reach temperatures well in excess of 160 °C (320 °F) which may damage the gasket in an ordinary pressure cooker causing it to fail. 

Recipe<====>97845<====>Recipe A recipe is a set of instructions that describes how to prepare or make something, especially a culinary dish.  It is also used in medicine or in information technology (user acceptance).  A doctor will usually begin a prescription with recipe, Latin for take, usually abbreviated to Rx or an equivalent symbol. HistoryEarly examplesThe earliest known written recipes date from approximately 1600 BC and come from an Akkadian tablet from southern Babylonia.   There are also ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics depicting the preparation of food.  Many ancient Greek recipes are known.  Mithaecus's cookbook was an early one, but most of it has been lost; Athenaeus quotes one short recipe in his Deipnosophistae. 

Row and column spaces<====>97848<====>Row and column spacesIn linear algebra, the column space (also called the range or image) of a matrix A is the span (set of all possible linear combinations) of its column vectors.  The column space of a matrix is the image or range of the corresponding matrix transformation. Let  \mathbb{F}  be a field.  The column space of an m × n matrix with components from  \mathbb{F}  is a linear subspace of the m-space  \mathbb{F}^m .   The dimension of the column space is called the rank of the matrix and is at most min(m, n). 

Australian Open<====>97851<====>Australian Open The Australian Open is a tennis tournament held annually over the last fortnight of January in Melbourne, Australia.  First held in 1905, the tournament is chronologically the first of the four Grand Slam tennis events of the year – the other three being the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open.  It features men's and women's singles; men's, women's and mixed doubles and junior's championships; as well as wheelchair, legends and exhibition events.  Prior to 1988 the tournament had been played on grass courts, but since then two types of hardcourt surfaces have been used at Melbourne Park – green coloured Rebound Ace up to 2007 and, afterwards, blue Plexicushion. 

Lake Vostok<====>97905<====>Lake Vostok   Lake Vostok ( , Ozero Vostok, lit.  "Lake East") is the largest of Antarctica's almost 400 known subglacial lakes. Lake Vostok is located at the southern Pole of Cold, beneath Russia's Vostok Station under the surface of the central East Antarctic Ice Sheet, which is at   above mean sea level.  The surface of this fresh water lake is approximately   under the surface of the ice, which places it at approximately   below sea level. Measuring   long by   wide at its widest point , it covers an area of   making it the 16th largest lake by surface area.

Size-exclusion chromatography<====>97911<====>Size-exclusion chromatography Size-exclusion chromatography  (SEC), also known as molecular sieve chromatography,  is a chromatographic method in which molecules in solution are separated by their size, and in some cases molecular weight.   It is usually applied to large molecules or macromolecular complexes such as proteins and industrial polymers.  Typically, when an aqueous solution is used to transport the sample through the column, the technique is known as gel-filtration chromatography, versus the name gel permeation chromatography, which is used when an organic solvent is used as a mobile phase.  SEC is a widely used polymer characterization method because of its ability to provide good molar mass distribution (Mw) results for polymers.

Differential scanning calorimetry<====>97914<====>Differential scanning calorimetry Differential scanning calorimetry, or DSC, is a thermoanalytical technique in which the difference in the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a sample and reference is measured as a function of temperature.  Both the sample and reference are maintained at nearly the same temperature throughout the experiment.  Generally, the temperature program for a DSC analysis is designed such that the sample holder temperature increases linearly as a function of time.  The reference sample should have a well-defined heat capacity over the range of temperatures to be scanned. The technique was developed by E. 

Small-angle neutron scattering<====>97916<====>Small-angle neutron scattering  Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is an experimental technique that uses elastic neutron scattering at small scattering angles to investigate the structure of various substances at a mesoscopic scale of about 1–100 nm. Small angle neutron scattering is in many respects very similar to small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS); both techniques are jointly referred to as small-angle scattering (SAS).  Advantages of SANS over SAXS are its sensitivity to light elements, the possibility of isotope labelling, and the strong scattering by magnetic moments. TechniqueDuring a SANS experiment a beam of neutrons is directed at a sample, which can be an aqueous solution, a solid, a powder, or a crystal. 

St David's Cathedral<====>97921<====>St David's Cathedral  St David's Cathedral ( ) is situated in St Davids in the county of Pembrokeshire, on the most westerly point of Wales. Early historyThe monastic community was founded by Saint David, Abbot of Menevia, who died in 589.  Between 645 and 1097, the community was attacked many times by raiders, including the Vikings, however it was of such note as both a religious and intellectual centre that King Alfred summoned help from the monastic community at St Davids in rebuilding the intellectual life of the Kingdom of Wessex.  Many of the bishops were murdered by raiders and marauders, including Bishop Moregenau in 999 and Bishop Abraham in 1080. 

Digital image processing<====>97922<====>Digital image processing  Digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to perform image processing on digital images.  As a subcategory or field of digital signal processing, digital image processing has many advantages over analog image processing.  It allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can avoid problems such as the build-up of noise and signal distortion during processing.  Since images are defined over two dimensions (perhaps more) digital image processing may be modeled in the form of multidimensional systems. HistoryMany of the techniques of digital image processing, or digital picture processing as it often was called, were developed in the 1960s at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell Laboratories, University of Maryland, and a few other research facilities, with application to satellite imagery, wire-photo standards conversion, medical imaging, videophone, character recognition, and photograph enhancement. 

Binary image<====>97923<====>Binary image  A binary image is a digital image that has only two possible values for each pixel.  Typically, the two colors used for a binary image are black and white.  The color used for the object(s) in the image is the foreground color while the rest of the image is the background color.   In the document-scanning industry, this is often referred to as "bi-tonal". Binary images are also called bi-level or two-level.  This means that each pixel is stored as a single bit—i. e. , a 0 or 1.  The names black-and-white, B&W, monochrome or monochromatic are often used for this concept, but may also designate any images that have only one sample per pixel, such as grayscale images. 

Metal matrix composite<====>97929<====>Metal matrix compositeA metal matrix composite (MMC) is  composite material with at least two constituent parts, one being a metal necessarily, the other material may be a different metal or another material, such as a ceramic or organic compound.  When at least three materials are present, it is called a hybrid composite.   An MMC is complementary to a cermet. CompositionMMCs are made by dispersing a  reinforcing material into a metal matrix.  The reinforcement surface can be coated to prevent a chemical reaction with the matrix.  For example, carbon fibers are commonly used in aluminium matrix to synthesize composites showing low density and high strength.

High cross<====>98030<====>High cross    A high cross or standing cross ( ,   ,  ) is a free-standing Christian cross made of stone and often richly decorated.  There was a unique Early Medieval tradition in Ireland and Britain of raising large sculpted stone crosses, usually outdoors.  These probably developed from earlier traditions using wood, perhaps with metalwork attachments, and earlier pagan Celtic memorial stones; the Pictish stones of Scotland may also have influenced the form.  The earliest surviving examples seem to come from the territory of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria, which had been converted to Christianity by Irish missionaries; it remains unclear whether the form first developed in Ireland or Britain.

Montu<====>98222<====>Montu   Montu was a falcon-god of war in ancient Egyptian religion.  Montu's name, shown in Egyptian hieroglyphs to the right, is technically transcribed as mn t w.  Because of the difficulty in transcribing Egyptian, it is often realized as Mont, Monthu, Montju, or Menthu.  Montu was an ancient god, his name meaning nomad, originally a manifestation of the scorching effect of the sun, Ra, and as such often appeared under the epithet Montu-Ra.  The destructiveness of this characteristic led to him gaining characteristics of a warrior, and eventually becoming a war-god. Because of the association of raging bulls with strength and war, Montu was also said to manifest himself in a white bull with a black face, which was referred to as the Bakha. 

Buchis<====>98223<====>BuchisIn Egyptian mythology, Buchis (also spelt Bakh and Bakha) was the   of the deification of Ka (power/life-force) of the war god Montu,  worshipped in the region of Hermonthis. A wild bull was chosen and said to be the Buchis incarnation of Montu, in which role it was worshipped as such.  Over time, the criteria for choosing the bull became more rigid, fixing themselves on what had been simply the general appearance of bulls in the region, being a white body and black face. When these bulls, or their mothers, died, they were mummified, and placed in a special cemetery known as the Bucheum. 

Sarmizegetusa Regia<====>98225<====>Sarmizegetusa Regia   Sarmizegetusa Regia, also Sarmisegetusa, Sarmisegethusa, Sarmisegethuza, Ζαρμιζεγεθούσα (Zarmizegethoúsa) or Ζερμιζεγεθούση (Zermizegethoúsē), was the capital and the most important military, religious and political centre of the Dacians prior to the wars with the Roman Empire.  Erected on top of a 1200 m high mountain, the fortress, comprising six citadels, was the core of a strategic defensive system in the Orăştie Mountains (in present-day Romania). Sarmizegetusa Regia should not be confused with Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa, the Roman capital of Dacia built by Roman Emperor Trajan some 40 km away, which was not the Dacian capital.  Sarmizegetusa Ulpia was discovered earlier, was known already in the early 1900s, and was initially mistaken for the Dacian capital, a confusion which led to incorrect conclusions being made regarding the military history and organization of the Dacians.

Passe-dix<====>98234<====>Passe-dixPasse-dix, also called passage in English, is a game of chance using dice.  It was described by Charles Cotton in The Compleat Gamester (1674) thus:"Passage is a Game at dice to be played at but by two, and it is performed with three Dice. The Caster throws continually until he hath thrown Dubblets under ten, and then he is out and loseth; or Dubblets above ten, and then he passeth and wins." Andrew Steinmetz, in The Gaming Table: Its Votaries and Victims, described it at greater length but somewhat confusingly (the results of rolling a 10 are unclear, depending on whether it wins for the bank or is a push, there is house advantage is at best 0, and at worst negative, and the suggestion that it was played at the crucifixion is of course sheer speculation):"Passe-dix is one of the, possibly the, most ancient of all games of chance, is said to have actually been made use of by the executioners at the crucifixion of our Saviour, when they parted his garments, casting lots, Matt. xxvii. 35."It is played with three dice. There is always a banker, and the number of players is unlimited. Each gamester holds the box by turns, and the other players follow his chance; every time he throws a point under ten he, as well as the other players, loses the entire stakes, which go to the banker. Every time he throws a point above ten (or passes ten -- whence the name of the game), the banker must double the player's stakes and the stakes of all those who have risked their money on the same chance.  When the game is played by many together, each gamester is banker in his turn."References External linksThe Gaming Table: Its Votaries and Victims, Vol. II, Chap. 10The Compleat Gamester (title page)

Silver Age of Comic Books<====>98279<====>Silver Age of Comic Books The Silver Age of Comic Books was a period of artistic advancement and commercial success in mainstream American comic books, predominantly those in the superhero genre.  Following the Golden Age of Comic Books and an interregnum in the early to mid-1950s, the Silver Age is considered to cover the period from 1956 to circa 1970, and was succeeded by the Bronze and Modern Ages.  The popularity and circulation of comic books about superheroes declined following World War II, and comic books about horror, crime and romance took larger shares of the market.  However, controversy arose over alleged links between comic books and juvenile delinquency, focusing in particular on crime and horror titles.

The best-known protocetid, Rodhocetus is known from two partial skeletons that taken together give a complete image of an Eocene whale that had short limbs with long hands and feet that were probably webbed and a sacrum that was immobile with four partially fused sacral vertebrae.   It is one of several extinct whale genera that possess land mammal characteristics, thus demonstrating the evolutionary transition from land to sea.

Dedun<====>98291<====>DedunDedun (or Dedwen) was a Nubian god worshipped during ancient times in that part of Africa and attested as early as 2400 BC.  There is much uncertainty about his original nature, especially since he was depicted as a lion, a role which usually was assigned to the son of another deity.  Nothing is known of the earlier Nubian mythology from which this deity arose, however.  The earliest known information in Egyptian writings about Dedun indicates that he already had become a god of incense by the time of the writings.  Since at this historical point, incense was an extremely expensive luxury commodity and Nubia was the source of much of it, he was quite an important deity. 

Impossible cube<====>98292<====>Impossible cubeThe impossible cube or irrational cube is an impossible object invented by M. C.  Escher for his print Belvedere.  It is a two-dimensional figure that superficially resembles a perspective drawing of a three-dimensional cube, with its features drawn inconsistently from the way they would appear in an actual cube.  In Belvedere a boy seated at the foot of a building holds an impossible cube.  A drawing of the related Necker cube (with its crossings circled) lies at his feet, while the building itself shares some of the same impossible features as the cube.   The impossible cube draws upon the ambiguity present in a Necker cube illustration, in which a cube is drawn with its edges as line segments, and can be interpreted as being in either of two different three-dimensional orientations.

He was identified with Ra and Osiris in Egyptian mythology,  as well as Dionysus   or Heracles in Greek mythology.   The identification with Heracles may be related to the fact that in later times his name was sometimes reanalysed as Ḥry-šf. 

Hesat<====>98313<====>HesatHesat is an ancient Egyptian goddess in the form of a cow.  She was said to provide humanity with milk (called "the beer of Hesat") and in particular to suckle the pharaoh and several ancient Egyptian bull gods.

She was especially connected with Mnevis, the living bull god worshipped at Heliopolis, and the mothers of Mnevis bulls were buried in a cemetery dedicated to Hesat.  In Ptolemaic times (304–30 BC) she was closely linked with the goddess Isis. 

Flexagon<====>98316<====>Flexagon In geometry, flexagons are flat models, usually constructed by folding strips of paper, that can be flexed or folded in certain ways to reveal faces besides the two that were originally on the back and front. Flexagons are usually square or rectangular (tetraflexagons) or hexagonal (hexaflexagons).   A prefix can be added to the name to indicate the number of faces that the model can display, including the two faces (back and front) that are visible before flexing.   For example, a hexaflexagon with a total of six faces is called a hexahexaflexagon. In hexaflexagon theory (that is, concerning flexagons with six sides), flexagons are usually defined in terms of pats.

KIM-1<====>98327<====>KIM-1 The KIM-1, short for Keyboard Input Monitor, was a small 6502-based single-board computer developed and produced by MOS Technology, Inc.  and launched in 1976.  It was very successful in that period, due to its low price (following from the inexpensive 6502) and easy-access expandability. HistoryMOS Technology's first processor, the 6501, could be plugged into existing motherboards that used the Motorola 6800, allowing potential users (i. e.  engineers and hobbyists) to get a development system up and running very easily using existing hardware.  Motorola immediately sued, forcing MOS to pull the 6501 from the market.   Changing the pin layout produced the "lawsuit-friendly" 6502. 

Marcus Didius Falco<====>98328<====>Marcus Didius Falco  Marcus Didius Falco is the fictional central character and narrator in a series of historical mystery crime novels by Lindsey Davis.

The tone is arch and satirical, but the historical setting is largely accurate. Fictional character biographyFalco was born on 20 or 21 March 41 AD   to Marcus Didius Favonius and Junilla Tacita.  His father is a somewhat shady auctioneer, and his family is of Plebeian rank, but Falco himself eventually achieves Equestrian rank.

Orbital elements<====>98663<====>Orbital elementsOrbital elements are the parameters required to uniquely identify a specific orbit.  In celestial mechanics these elements are generally considered in classical two-body systems, where a Kepler orbit is used.  There are many different ways to mathematically describe the same orbit, but certain schemes, each consisting of a set of six parameters, are commonly used in astronomy and orbital mechanics. A real orbit (and its elements) changes over time due to gravitational perturbations by other objects and the effects of relativity.  A Keplerian orbit is merely an idealized, mathematical approximation at a particular time. Keplerian elementsThe traditional orbital elements are the six Keplerian elements, after Johannes Kepler and his laws of planetary motion.

Relational database management system<====>98743<====>Relational database management systemA relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model invented by Edgar F.  Codd, of IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory.  Most databases in widespread use are based on the relational database model.  RDBMSs have been a common choice for the storage of information in new databases used for financial records, manufacturing and logistical information, personnel data, and other applications since the 1980s.  Relational databases have often replaced legacy hierarchical databases and network databases because they are easier to understand and use.  However, relational databases have received unsuccessful challenge attempts by object database management systems in the 1980s and 1990s (which were introduced trying to address the so-called object-relational impedance mismatch between relational databases and object-oriented application programs) and also by XML database management systems in the 1990s. 

Tree automaton<====>98748<====>Tree automaton A tree automaton is a type of state machine.  Tree automata deal with tree structures, rather than the strings of more conventional state machines. The following article deals with branching tree automata, which correspond to regular languages of trees. As with classical automata, finite tree automata (FTA) can be either a deterministic automaton or not.  According to how the automaton processes the input tree, finite tree automata can be of two types: (a) bottom up, (b) top down.  This is an important issue, as although non-deterministic (ND) top-down and ND bottom-up tree automata are equivalent in expressive power, deterministic top-down automata are strictly less powerful than their deterministic bottom-up counterparts, because tree properties specified by deterministic top-down tree automata can only depend on path properties.

Spanning tree also allows a network design to include backup links to provide fault tolerance if an active link fails. As the name suggests, STP creates a spanning tree within a network of connected layer-2 bridges, and disables those links that are not part of the spanning tree, leaving a single active path between any two network nodes.  STP is based on an algorithm that was invented by Radia Perlman while she was working for Digital Equipment Corporation. 

Serialism<====>98764<====>Serialism In music, serialism  is a method or technique of composition that uses a series of values to manipulate different musical elements.  Serialism began primarily with Arnold Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique, though some of his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as a form of post-tonal thinking.  Twelve-tone technique orders the twelve notes of the chromatic scale, forming a row or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition's melody, harmony, structural progressions, and variations.  Other types of serialism also work with sets, collections of objects, but not necessarily with fixed-order series, and extend the technique to other musical dimensions (often called "parameters"), such as duration, dynamics, and timbre. 

Hidden Markov model<====>98770<====>Hidden Markov model Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved (i. e.  hidden) states. The hidden Markov model can be represented as the simplest dynamic Bayesian network.  The mathematics behind the HMM were developed by L.  E.  Baum and coworkers.  HMM is closely related to an earlier work on the optimal nonlinear filtering problem by Ruslan L.  Stratonovich,    who was the first to describe the forward-backward procedure. In simpler Markov models (like a Markov chain), the state is directly visible to the observer, and therefore the state transition probabilities are the only parameters, while in the hidden Markov model, the state is not directly visible, but the output, dependent on the state, is visible. 

Samariá Gorge<====>98771<====>Samariá GorgeThe Samariá Gorge (  or just Φάραγγας) is aNational Park of Greece since 1962 on the island of Crete – a major tourist attraction of the island – and a World's Biosphere Reserve.

Natural language understanding<====>98778<====>Natural language understandingNatural language understanding (NLU) is a subtopic  of natural language processing in artificial intelligence that deals with machine reading comprehension.  NLU is considered an AI-hard problem.  The process of disassembling and parsing input is more complex than the reverse process of assembling output in natural language generation because of the occurrence of unknown and unexpected features in the input and the need to determine the appropriate syntactic and semantic schemes to apply to it, factors which are pre-determined when outputting language.  There is considerable commercial interest in the field because of its application to news-gathering, text categorization, voice-activation, archiving, and large-scale content-analysis. 

La Monte Young<====>98784<====>La Monte Young   La Monte Thornton Young (born October 14, 1935) is an American avant-garde composer, musician, and artist generally recognized as the first minimalist composer.

Grimshaw, Jeremy, Draw a Straight Line and Follow It: The Music and Mysticism of La Monte Young.  Oxford University Press, 2012   Initially inspired by sources such as Indian classical music, serialism, and jazz,Young is perhaps best known for his pioneering work in Western drone music (originally referred to as "dream music"), prominently explored in the 1960s with the experimental music collective the Theatre of Eternal Music. 

SHRDLU<====>98791<====>SHRDLU   SHRDLU was an early  natural language understanding computer program, developed by Terry Winograd at MIT in 1968–1970.  In it, the user carries on a conversation with the computer, moving objects, naming collections and querying the state of a simplified "blocks world", essentially a virtual box filled with different blocks. SHRDLU was written in the Micro Planner and Lisp programming language on the DEC PDP-6 computer and a DEC graphics terminal.  Later additions were made at the computer graphics labs at the University of Utah, adding a full 3D rendering of SHRDLU's "world". The name SHRDLU was derived from ETAOIN SHRDLU, the arrangement of the alpha keys on a Linotype machine, arranged in descending order of usage frequency in English.

Bolometer<====>98918<====>Bolometer A bolometer is a device for measuring the power of incident electromagnetic radiation via the heating of a material with a temperature-dependent electrical resistance.  It was invented in 1878 by the American astronomer Samuel Pierpont Langley.  Principle of operationA bolometer consists of an absorptive element, such as a thin layer of metal, connected to a thermal reservoir (a body of constant temperature) through a thermal link.  The result is that any radiation impinging on the absorptive element raises its temperature above that of the reservoir – the greater the absorbed power, the higher the temperature.  The intrinsic thermal time constant, which sets the speed of the detector, is equal to the ratio of the heat capacity of the absorptive element to the thermal conductance between the absorptive element and the reservoir.

Linear classifier<====>98974<====>Linear classifierIn the field of machine learning, the goal of statistical classification is to use an object's characteristics to identify which class (or group) it belongs to.   A linear classifier achieves this by making a classification decision based on the value of a linear combination of the characteristics.   An object's characteristics are also known as feature values and are typically presented to the machine in a vector called a feature vector.  Such classifiers work well for practical problems such as document classification, and more generally for problems with many variables (features), reaching accuracy levels comparable to non-linear classifiers while taking less time to train and use. 

Algebraic integer<====>98981<====>Algebraic integer  In algebraic number theory, an algebraic integer is a complex number that is a root of some monic polynomial (a polynomial whose leading coefficient is 1) with coefficients in  \Z  (the set of integers).  The set of all algebraic integers,  A , is closed under addition and multiplication and therefore is a commutative subring of the complex numbers.  The ring  A  is the integral closure of regular integers  \Z  in complex numbers. The ring of integers of a number field  K , denoted by  \mathcal{O}_K , is the intersection of  K  and  A : it can also be characterised as the maximal order of the field  K .

Although the focus of a national trust may vary by region, the principal role is to ensure the preservation of historically significant items, and to conserve areas of natural beauty.  National trusts generally operate as private non-profit organizations.  The first such trust organisation, The Trustees of Reservations, originated in 1890 as a regional group serving the state of Massachusetts, USA.The first national trust, the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty, was founded in England in 1895 and operates as a charitable organisation serving England, Wales and Northern Ireland (it is commonly known in the UK as the National Trust).

Luna 5<====>99152<====>Luna 5DISPLAYTITLE Luna 5, or E-6 No. 10, was an unmanned Soviet spacecraft intended to land on the Moon as part of the Luna programme.  It was intended to become the first spacecraft to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, however its retrorockets failed, and the spacecraft impacted the lunar surface. LaunchLuna 5 was launched by a Molniya-M carrier rocket, flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.  Liftoff occurred at 07:49:37 UTC on 9 May 1965.  The spacecraft and Blok L upper stage entered a low Earth parking orbit, before the Blok L fired to propel Luna 5 towards the Moon. 

Luna 6<====>99153<====>Luna 6  Luna 6, or E-6 No. 7 was an unmanned Soviet spacecraft which was intended to perform a landing on the Moon as part of the Luna program.  Due to the failure of a mid-course correction manoeuvre, Luna 6 failed to land, instead flying past the Moon at a distance of  . LaunchLuna 6 was launched by a Molniya-M carrier rocket flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.  Liftoff occurred at 07:40 UTC on 8 June 1965, with the spacecraft and Blok L upper stage entering a low Earth parking orbit, before the upper stage propelled the spacecraft into a heliocentric orbit passing the Moon. 

Luna 7<====>99154<====>Luna 7  Luna 7 (E-6 series) was an unmanned space mission of the Soviet Luna program, also called Lunik 7.  The Luna 7 spacecraft was intended to achieve a soft landing on the Moon.  However, due to premature retrofire and cutoff of the retrorockets, the spacecraft impacted the lunar surface in Oceanus Procellarum. Unlike its predecessors, Luna 7 successfully carried out its mid-course correction on October 5 on the way to the Moon, in anticipation of a soft-landing two days later.  However, immediately prior to planned retro-fire during the approach to the lunar surface, the spacecraft suddenly lost attitude control and failed to regain it. 

Luna 8<====>99155<====>Luna 8  Luna 8 (E-6 series), also known as Lunik 8,  was a lunar space probe of the Luna program.  It was launched in on December 3, 1965 with the objective of achieving a soft landing on the Moon.  However, its retrorocket firing occurred too late, and suffered a hard impact on the lunar surface on the Oceanus Procellarum (Ocean of Storms).  The mission did complete the experimental testing of its stellar-guidance system and the ground-control of its radio telemetry equipment, its flight trajectory, and its other instrumentation. This, the eleventh Soviet attempt to achieve a lunar soft landing, nearly succeeded. 

Luna 9<====>99156<====>Luna 9  Luna 9, internal designation Ye-6 No. 13, was an unmanned space mission of the Soviet Union's Luna programme.  On 3 February 1966 the Luna 9 spacecraft became the first spacecraft to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, or any planetary body other than Earth, and to transmit photographic data to Earth from the surface of another planetary body. SpacecraftThe lander had a mass of  .  It used a landing bag to survive the impact speed of  .    It was a hermetically sealed container with radio equipment, a program timing device, heat control systems, scientific apparatus, power sources, and a television system. 

Luna 10<====>99158<====>Luna 10  Luna 10 (E-6S series) was a 1966 Soviet Luna program, robotic spacecraft mission, also called Lunik 10.  It was the first artificial satellite of the Moon. The spacecraftScientific instruments included a gamma-ray spectrometer for energies between 0. 3—3 MeV (50–500 pJ), a triaxial magnetometer, a meteorite detector, instruments for solar-plasma studies, and devices for measuring infrared emissions from the Moon and radiation conditions of the lunar environment.  Gravitational studies were also conducted.  Luna 10 conducted extensive research in lunar orbit, gathering important data on the strength of the Moon’s magnetic field, its radiation belts, and the nature of lunar rocks (which were found to be comparable to terrestrial basalt rocks), cosmic radiation, and micrometeoroid density. 

Luna 11<====>99159<====>Luna 11   Luna 11 (E-6LF series) was an unmanned space mission of the Soviet Union's Luna program.  It was also called Lunik 11. Luna 11 was launched towards the Moon from an earth-orbiting platform and entered lunar orbit on 27 August 1966. OverviewThe objectives of the mission included the study of:lunar gamma and X-ray emissions in order to determine the Moon's chemical composition;lunar gravitational anomalies;the concentration of meteorite streams near the Moon;the intensity of hard corpuscular radiation near the Moon. 137 radio transmissions and 277 orbits of the Moon were completed before the batteries failed on 1 October 1966. 

Luna 12<====>99160<====>Luna 12 Luna 12 (E-6LF series) was an unmanned space mission of the Luna program, also called Lunik 12. Luna 12 was launched towards the Moon from an Earth-orbiting platform and achieved lunar orbit on October 25, 1966.  The spacecraft was equipped with a television system that obtained and transmitted photographs of the lunar surface.  The photographs contained 1100 scan lines with a maximum resolution of 14. 9-19. 8 m.  Pictures of the lunar surface were returned on October 27, 1966.  The number of photographs is not known.  Radio transmissions from Luna 12 ceased on January 19, 1967, after 602 lunar orbits and 302 radio transmissions. 

Luna 13<====>99161<====>Luna 13 Luna 13 (E-6M series) was an unmanned space mission of the Luna program. The Luna 13 spacecraft was launched toward the Moon from an earth-orbiting platform and accomplished a soft landing on December 24, 1966, in the region of Oceanus Procellarum ("Ocean of Storms"). The petal encasement of the spacecraft was opened, antennas were erected, and radio transmissions to Earth began four minutes after the landing.  On December 25 and December 26, 1966, the spacecraft television system transmitted panoramas of the nearby lunar landscape at different Sun angles.  Each panorama required approximately 100 minutes to transmit. 

Luna 14<====>99162<====>Luna 14  Luna 14 (E-6LS series) was an unmanned space mission of the Luna program run by the Soviet Union.  It was also called Lunik 14. The spacecraft is believed to have been similar to Luna 12 and the instrumentation was similar to that carried by Luna 10.  It provided data for studies of the interaction of the earth and lunar masses, the lunar gravitational field, the propagation and stability of radio communications to the spacecraft at different orbital positions, solar charged particles and cosmic rays, and the motion of the Moon.  This flight was the final flight of the second generation of the Luna series. 

Argyria<====>99163<====>Argyria   Argyria or argyrosis is a condition caused by excessive exposure to chemical compounds of the element silver, or to silver dust.The most dramatic symptom of argyria is that the skin turns purple or purple-grey.  It may take the form of generalized argyria or local argyria.  Generalized argyria affects large areas over much of the visible surface of the body.  Local argyria shows in limited regions of the body, such as patches of skin, parts of the mucous membrane or the conjunctiva. The terms argyria and argyrosis have long been used interchangeably,  with argyria being used more frequently. 

Luna 15<====>99164<====>Luna 15 Luna 15 was an unmanned space mission of the Soviet Luna programme. On 21 July 1969, while Apollo 11 astronauts finished the first human moonwalk, Luna 15, an unmanned Soviet spacecraft in lunar orbit at the time, began its descent to the lunar surface.   Launched three days before the Apollo 11 mission, it was the second Soviet attempt to return lunar soil back to Earth with a goal to outstrip the US in sample return under Moon race.  The Soviet craft crashed into the Moon at 15:50 UT, hours before the scheduled American lift off from the Moon. 

Luna 16<====>99165<====>Luna 16  Luna 16, also known as Lunik 16, was an unmanned space mission, part of the Soviet Luna program. Luna 16 was the first robotic probe to land on the Moon and return a sample of lunar soil to Earth after five unsuccessful similar attempts.   The sample was returned from Mare Fecunditatis.  It represented the first lunar sample return mission by the Soviet Union and was the third lunar sample return mission overall, following the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions. The spacecraft consisted of two attached stages, an ascent stage mounted on top of a descent stage.

Luna 17<====>99167<====>Luna 17  Luna 17 (Ye-8 series) was an unmanned space mission of the Luna program, also called Lunik 17. LaunchLuna 17 was launched from an Earth parking orbit towards the Moon and entered lunar orbit on 15 November 1970.  The spacecraft softly landed on the Moon in the Sea of Rains.  The spacecraft had dual ramps by which the payload, Lunokhod 1, descended to the lunar surface.  Lunokhod 1 was a lunar vehicle formed of a tub-like compartment with a large convex lid on eight independently powered wheels.  Lunokhod 1 was equipped with a cone-shaped antenna, a highly directional helical antenna, four television cameras, and special extendable devices to impact the lunar soil for soil density and mechanical property tests. 

Luna 18<====>99168<====>Luna 18   Luna 18, part of the Ye-8-5 series, was an unmanned space mission of the Luna program. Luna 18 was placed in an Earth parking orbit after it was launched and was then sent towards the Moon.  On 7 September 1971, it entered lunar orbit.  The spacecraft completed 85 communications sessions and 54 lunar orbits before it was sent towards the lunar surface by use of braking rockets.  It impacted the Moon on 11 September 1971, at 3 degrees 34 minutes N, 56 degrees 30 minutes E (selenographic coordinates) in a rugged mountainous terrain. 

Luna 19<====>99169<====>Luna 19  Luna 19 (a. k. a.  Lunik 19) (E-8-LS series), was an unmanned space mission of the Luna program.  Luna 19 extended the systematic study of lunar gravitational fields and location of mascons (mass concentrations).  It also studied the lunar radiation environment, the gamma-active lunar surface, and the solar wind.  Photographic coverage via a television system was also obtained. Luna 19 was the first of the “advanced” lunar orbiters whose design was based uponthe same Ye-8-class bus used for the lunar rovers and the sample collectors.  For these orbiters, designated Ye-8LS, the basic “lander stage” was topped off by a wheelless Lunokhod-like frame that housed all scientific instrumentation in a pressurized container. 

Luna 20<====>99170<====>Luna 20    Luna 20  was the second of three successful Soviet lunar sample return missions.  It was flown as part of the Luna program as a robotic competitor to the six successful Apollo lunar sample return missions. Luna 20 was placed in an intermediate Earth parking orbit and from this orbit was sent towards the Moon.  It entered lunar orbit on February 18, 1972.  On February 21, 1972, Luna 20 soft landed on the Moon in a mountainous area known as the Terra Apollonius (or Apollonius highlands) near Mare Fecunditatis (Sea of Fertility), 120 km from where Luna 16 had landed. 

Luna 21<====>99171<====>Luna 21   Luna 21 (Ye-8 series) was an unmanned space mission, and its spacecraft, of the Luna program, also called Lunik 21, in 1973.  The spacecraft landed on the Moon and deployed the second Soviet lunar rover, Lunokhod 2.  The primary objectives of the mission were to collect images of the lunar surface, examine ambient light levels to determine the feasibility of astronomical observations from the Moon, perform laser ranging experiments from Earth, observe solar X-rays, measure local magnetic fields, and study mechanical properties of the lunar surface material. MissionLuna 21 carried the second successful Soviet lunar rover, Lunokhod 2, and was launched less than a month after the last Apollo lunar landing. 

Luna 22<====>99172<====>Luna 22   Luna 22 (Ye-8-LS series) was an unmanned space mission, part of the Soviet Luna program, also called Lunik 22. Luna 22 was a lunar orbiter mission.  The spacecraft carried imaging cameras and also had the objectives of studying the Moon's magnetic field, surface gamma ray emissions and composition of lunar surface rocks, and the gravitational field, as well as micrometeorites and cosmic rays.  Luna 22 was launched into Earth parking orbit and then to the Moon.  It was inserted into a circular lunar orbit on 2 June 1974.  The spacecraft made many orbit adjustments over its 18-month lifetime in order to optimize the operation of various experiments, lowering the perilune to as little as 25 km. 

Luna 23<====>99174<====>Luna 23  Luna 23 was an unmanned space mission of the Luna program. Luna 23 was a Moon lander mission which was intended to return a lunar sample to Earth.  Launched to the Moon by a Proton-K/D, the spacecraft was damaged during landing in Mare Crisium (Sea of Crises).  The sample collecting apparatus could not operate and no samples were returned.  The lander continued transmissions for three days after landing.  In 1976, Luna 24 landed several hundred meters away and successfully returned samples.  The asteroid-like object 2010 KQ is believed to be a rocket that parted the Luna 23 module after launch. 

Luna 24<====>99175<====>Luna 24   Luna 24 was an unmanned space mission of the Soviet Union's Luna programme.  The last of the Luna series of spacecraft, the mission of the Luna 24 probe was the third Soviet mission to retrieve lunar soil samples from the Earth's moon (the first two sample return missions were Luna 16 and Luna 20).  The spacecraft orbital dry mass was  . The probe landed in Mare Crisium (Sea of Crises).  The mission returned   of lunar samples to the Earth on 22 August 1976. Lunar mission Sample returned Year Luna 16 101 g  1970 Luna 20 30 g  1972 Luna 24 170. 

The Reverend<====>99176<====>The Reverend  The Reverend is an honorific style  most often placed before the names of Christian clergy and ministers.  There are sometimes differences in the way the style is used in different countries and church traditions.  The Reverend is correctly called a style but is often and in some dictionaries called a title, form of address or title of respect.The style is also sometimes used by leaders in non-Christian religions such as Judaism and Buddhism. The term is an anglicisation of the Latin reverendus, the style originally used in Latin documents in medieval Europe. 

Bungay<====>99178<====>Bungay    Bungay    is a market town and electoral ward in the English county of Suffolk.  OS Explorer Map OL40: The Broads: (1:25 000) :  .    It lies in the Waveney valley,   west of Beccles on the edge of The Broads, and at the neck of a meander of the River Waveney. HistoryThe origin of the name of Bungay is thought to derive from the Anglo-Saxon title Bunincga-haye, signifying the land belonging to the tribe of Bonna, a Saxon chieftain.  Due to its high position, protected by the River Waveney and marshes, the site was in a good defensive position and attracted settlers from early times. 

Kessingland<====>99183<====>Kessingland   Kessingland is a large village in the Waveney District of the English county of Suffolk.  It is located around   south of Lowestoft.  It is of interest to archaeologists as Palaeolithic and Neolithic implements have been found here;the remains of an ancient forest lie buried on the seabed. There has been a settlement here since Palaeolithic times.  Between the Hundred River and Latmer Dam was once a large estuary which was used by the Vikings and Romans.   The sea provided the village with its main livelihood, and at one time the village paid a rent of 22,000 herrings to their Lords, which then made it more important than nearby Lowestoft. 

Davos<====>99184<====>Davos   Davos   (German pronunciation    ;  , archaic Italian: Tavate) is an Alpine town, and a municipality in the Prättigau/Davos Region in the canton of Graubünden, Switzerland.  It has a permanent population of   ( ).   Davos is located on the river Landwasser, in the Rhaetian Alps, between the Plessur and Albula Range.  At  , it is the highest "town" in Europe. The former Alpine resort village consists of two parts: Davos Dorf (Village) to the north-east towards Klosters and further down through the Prättigau to Landquart, and Davos Platz (Place) to the south-west, which opens into the valley of the Landwasser (lit. 

Châlons-en-Champagne<====>99185<====>Châlons-en-Champagne    Châlons-en-Champagne (  or [ʃɑ. lɔ̃. ɑ̃. ʃɑ̃. paɲ]) is a city in the Grand Est region of France.  It is the capital of the department of Marne, despite being only a quarter the size of the city of Reims. Formerly called Châlons-sur-Marne, the city was officially renamed in 1998.

George E. Clymer<====>99206<====>George E.  Clymer George Clymer (1754?–1834) from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was an American engineer and inventor (he is sometimes called "George E.  Clymer", but this middle initial is probably an error based on a misreading of an early census record; no evidence for a middle name, if he had one, has so far been found).  Around 1813 he invented the Columbian Printing Press.  This was a cast-iron, lever-operated replacement for the wooden screw presses which had been in use in Europe since the fifteenth century and in North America since the seventeenth. Clymer appears to have begun making wooden presses of the traditional type before 1800, and may have introduced refinements to the design.

Helmet Law Defense League<====>99208<====>Helmet Law Defense League  The Helmet Law Defense League (HLDL) is a group founded in 1993 that opposes the laws in states which mandate motorcycle helmets.  The group contends that mandatory motorcycle helmet laws enacted at the state, county, and municipal levels of government against consumers and users are unconstitutional due to vagueness, and this often results in arbitrary and ad hoc enforcement in those states which have enacted mandatory helmet laws. The HLDL claims that the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards  (FMVSS) enacted by the US Congress at the United States Federal level under USC Title 49 Chapter 301 apply to manufacturers, importers, distributors, and retailers, but proscribe no regulation to consumers and motorists, and in the opinion of the HLDL's supporters, no enforcement guidelines for law enforcement agencies at the state level or below.

Iranian calendars<====>99227<====>Iranian calendars  The Iranian calendars (  Gâhshomâriye Irâni) are a succession of calendars invented or used for over two millennia in Iran (Persia).  One of the longest chronological records in human history, the Iranian calendar has been modified time and again during its history to suit administrative, climatic, and religious purposes. The modern Iranian calendar is now the official calendar in Iran.  It begins at the midnight nearest to the instant of the vernal equinox as determined by astronomical calculations for the Iran Standard Time meridian (52. 5°E or GMT+3. 5h).    It is, therefore, an observation-based calendar, unlike the Gregorian, which is rule-based.

Aleatoric music<====>99234<====>Aleatoric musicAleatoric music (also aleatory music or chance music; from the Latin word alea, meaning "dice") is music in which some element of the composition is left to chance, and/or some primary element of a composed work's realization is left to the determination of its performer(s).  The term is most often associated with procedures in which the chance element involves a relatively limited number of possibilities. The term became known to European composers through lectures by acoustician Werner Meyer-Eppler at the Darmstadt International Summer Courses for New Music in the beginning of the 1950s.  According to his definition, “a process is said to be aleatoric […] if its course is determined in general but depends on chance in detail”  .

King's Cross fire<====>99244<====>King's Cross fire  On 18 November 1987, at approximately 19:30, a fire broke out at King's Cross St Pancras tube station, a major interchange on the London Underground.  As well as the mainline railway stations above ground and subsurface platforms for the Metropolitan lines,  there were platforms deeper underground for the Northern, Piccadilly, and Victoria lines.  The fire started under a wooden escalator serving the Piccadilly line and, at 19:45, erupted in a flashover into the underground ticket hall, killing 31 people and injuring 100. A public inquiry was conducted from February to June 1988.  The investigators reproduced the fire twice, once to determine whether grease under the escalator was ignitable, and the other to determine whether a computer simulation of the fire—which would have determined the cause of the flashover—was accurate. 

Morphological derivation<====>99258<====>Morphological derivationMorphological derivation, in linguistics, is the process of forming a new word from an existing word, often by adding a prefix or suffix, such as   For example, happiness and unhappy derive from the root word happy. It is differentiated from inflection, which is the modification of a word to form different grammatical categories without changing its core meaning: determines, determining, and determined are from the root determine.  Derivational patternsDerivational morphology often involves the addition of a derivational suffix or other affix.  Such an affix usually applies to words of one lexical category (part of speech) and changes them into words of another such category. 

Classicism<====>99260<====>Classicism   Classicism, in the arts, refers generally to a high regard for a classical period, classical antiquity in the Western tradition, as setting standards for taste which the classicists seek to emulate.  The art of classicism typically seeks to be formal and restrained: of the Discobolus Sir Kenneth Clark observed, "if we object to his restraint and compression we are simply objecting to the classicism of classic art.  A violent emphasis or a sudden acceleration of rhythmic movement would have destroyed those qualities of balance and completeness through which it retained until the present century its position of authority in the restricted repertoire of visual images.

Peat<====>99404<====>Peat  Peat ( ), also called turf ( ), is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation or organic matter that is unique to natural areas called peatlands, bogs, mires, moors, or muskegs.   The peatland ecosystem is the most efficient carbon sink on the planet,  because peatland plants capture CO 2  naturally released from the peat, maintaining an equilibrium.  In natural peatlands, the "annual rate of biomass production is greater than the rate of decomposition", but it takes "thousands of years for peatlands to develop the deposits of  , which is the average depth of the boreal [northern] peatlands".

Coppicing<====>99421<====>Coppicing Coppicing is a traditional method of woodland management which exploits the capacity of many species of trees to put out new shoots from their stump or roots if cut down.  In a   wood, which is called a copse, young tree stems are repeatedly cut down to near ground level, known as a stool.  New growth emerges and after a number of years, the coppiced tree is harvested and the cycle begins anew.  Pollarding is a similar process carried out at a higher level on the tree. Many silviculture practices involve cutting and regrowth; coppicing has been of significance in many parts of lowland temperate Europe.

Naphthalene<====>99426<====>Naphthalene  Naphthalene is an organic compound with formula  .  It is the simplest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and is a white crystalline solid with a characteristic odor that is detectable at concentrations as low as 0. 08 ppm by mass.   As an aromatic hydrocarbon, naphthalene's structure consists of a fused pair of benzene rings.  It is best known as the main ingredient of traditional mothballs. HistoryIn the early 1820s, two separate reports described a white solid with a pungent odor derived from the distillation of coal tar.  In 1821, John Kidd cited these two disclosures and then described many of this substance's properties and the means of its production. 

Site of Special Scientific Interest<====>99430<====>Site of Special Scientific InterestA Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in Great Britain or an Area of Special Scientific Interest (ASSI) in the Isle of Man and Northern Ireland is a conservation designation denoting a protected area in the United Kingdom and Isle of Man.   SSSI/ASSIs are the basic building block of site-based nature conservation legislation and most other legal nature/geological conservation designations in the United Kingdom are based upon them, including national nature reserves, Ramsar sites, Special Protection Areas, and Special Areas of Conservation.  The acronym "SSSI" is often pronounced "triple-S I". 

Advanced Encryption Standard process<====>99431<====>Advanced Encryption Standard processThe Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), the symmetric block cipher ratified as a standard by National Institute of Standards and Technology of the United States (NIST), was chosen using a process lasting from 1997 to 2000 that was markedly more open and transparent than its predecessor, the Data Encryption Standard (DES).  This process won praise from the open cryptographic community, and helped to increase confidence in the security of the winning algorithm from those who were suspicious of backdoors in the predecessor, DES. A new standard was needed primarily because DES has a relatively small 56-bit key which was becoming vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

Several Hasbro properties, such as Monopoly and Scrabble, had already been made into successful video games by licensees such as Virgin Interactive.  With Hasbro's game experience, video games seemed like a natural extension of the company and a good opportunity for revenue growth. 

Extended Euclidean algorithm<====>99438<====>Extended Euclidean algorithmIn arithmetic and computer programming, the extended Euclidean algorithm is an extension to the Euclidean algorithm, and computes, in addition to the greatest common divisor of integers a and b, also  the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which are integers x and y such that ax + by = \gcd(a, b).  This is a certifying algorithm, because the gcd is the only number that can simultaneously satisfy this equation and divide the inputs. It allows one to compute also, with almost no extra cost, the quotients of a and b by their greatest common divisor. Extended Euclidean algorithm also refers to a very similar algorithm for computing the polynomial greatest common divisor and the coefficients of Bézout's identity of two univariate polynomials.

Westermarck effect<====>99471<====>Westermarck effect The Westermarck effect, or reverse sexual imprinting, is a hypothetical psychological effect through which people who live in close domestic proximity during the first few years of their lives become desensitized to sexual attraction.  This phenomenon was first hypothesized by Finnish anthropologist Edvard Westermarck in his book The History of Human Marriage (1891) as one explanation for the incest taboo.  Observations interpreted as evidence for the Westermarck effect have since been made in many places and cultures, including in the Israeli kibbutz system, and the Chinese Shim-pua marriage customs, as well as in biologically-related families. In the case of the Israeli kibbutzim (collective farms), children were reared somewhat communally in peer groups, based on age, not biological relation.

It was originally developed in C on HP9000 workstations which ran Unix. 

Deathmatch<====>99482<====>Deathmatch  Deathmatch, or, more appropriately, Free-For-All (FFA, also called DM or Player vs All), is a widely used gameplay mode integrated into many shooter and real-time strategy (RTS) video games.  Normally, the goal of a deathmatch game is to kill (or "frag", from the military term) as many other players as possible until a certain condition or limit is reached, commonly being a frag limit or a time limit.

Presentation of a group<====>99494<====>Presentation of a group In mathematics, one method of defining a group is by a presentation.  One specifies a set S of generators so that every element of the group can be written as a product of powers of some of these generators, and a set R of relations among those generators.

Cecum<====>99597<====>Cecum   The cecum or caecum ( , plural ceca  ; from the Latin   meaning blind) is an intraperitoneal pouch that is considered to be the beginning of the large intestine.  It is typically located on the right side of the body (the same side of the body as the appendix, to which it is joined). It receives chyme from the ileum, and connects to the ascending colon of the large intestine.  It is separated from the ileum by the ileocecal valve (ICV) or Bauhin's valve.  It is also separated from the colon by the cecocolic junction.

Ileum<====>99599<====>Ileum  The ileum   is the final section of the small intestine in most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds.  In fish, the divisions of the small intestine are not as clear and the terms posterior intestine or distal intestine may be used instead of ileum.    The ileum follows the duodenum and jejunum and is separated from the cecum by the ileocecal valve (ICV).  In humans, the ileum is about 2–4 m long, and the pH is usually between 7 and 8 (neutral or slightly alkaline). Ileum is derived from the Greek word eilein, meaning "to twist up tightly. 

Pollarding<====>99601<====>Pollarding Pollarding, a pruning system involving the removal of the upper branches of a tree, promotes a dense head of foliage and branches.  In ancient Rome, Propertius mentioned pollarding during the 1st century BCE.The practice has occurred commonly in Europe since medieval times and takes place today in urban areas worldwide, primarily to maintain trees at a predetermined height.  Traditionally, people pollarded trees for one of two reasons: for fodder to feed livestock, or for wood.  This is not a practice to use if one wants an attractive, natural tree, as the natural growth becomes stunted.

Wrought iron<====>99603<====>Wrought iron is constructed from puddled iron, a form of wrought iron]]  Wrought iron is an iron alloy with a very low carbon (less than 0. 08%) content in contrast to cast iron (2. 1% to 4%).  It is a semi-fused mass of iron with fibrous slag inclusions (up to 2% by weight), which gives it a "grain" resembling wood that is visible when it is etched or bent to the point of failure.  Wrought iron is tough, malleable, ductile, corrosion-resistant and easily welded.  Before the development of effective methods of steelmaking and the availability of large quantities of steel, wrought iron was the most common form of malleable iron.

Jejunum<====>99608<====>Jejunum The jejunum (   ) is the second part of the small intestine in humans and most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds. The jejunum lies between the duodenum and the ileum.  The jejunum is considered to begin at the attachment of the suspensory muscle of the duodenum to the duodenum, a location called the duodenojejunal flexure.   The division between the jejunum and ileum is not anatomically distinct.In adult humans, the small intestine is usually 6-7m long, about two-fifths of which (2. 5 m) is the jejunum.    Structure The interior surface of the jejunum—which is exposed to ingested food—is covered in finger-like projections of mucosa, called villi, which increase the surface area of tissue available to absorb nutrients from ingested foodstuffs. 

Small intestine<====>99610<====>Small intestine The small intestine or small bowel is the part of the gastrointestinal tract between the stomach and the large intestine, and is where most of the end absorption of food takes place.  The small intestine has three distinct regions – the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.  The duodenum is the shortest part of the small intestine and is where preparation for absorption begins.  It also receives bile and pancreatic juice through the pancreatic duct, controlled by the sphincter of Oddi.   The primary function of the small intestine is the absorption of nutrients and minerals from food, using small finger-like protrusions called villi. 

Appendix (anatomy)<====>99611<====>Appendix (anatomy)  The appendix (or vermiform appendix; also cecal [or caecal] appendix; vermix; or vermiform process) is a blind-ended tube connected to the cecum, from which it develops in the embryo.  The cecum is a pouchlike structure of the colon, located at the junction of the small and the large intestines. The term "vermiform" comes from Latin and means "worm-shaped". StructureThe human appendix averages 9 cm in length but can range from 2 to 20 cm.  The diameter of the appendix is usually between 7 and 8 mm.  The longest appendix ever removed was 26 cm long.  It was removed from a patient in Zagreb, Croatia.

Aldeburgh<====>99633<====>Aldeburgh   Aldeburgh (   ) is a coastal town in the English county of Suffolk.  Located on the North Sea coast to the north of the River Alde, the town is notable for having been the home of composer Benjamin Britten and as the centre of the international Aldeburgh Festival of arts at nearby Snape Maltings founded by him in 1948.  Aldeburgh Town Council.  Retrieved 9 January 2016.   It remains an artistic and literary centre with an annual Poetry Festival and several food festivals as well as other cultural events.   It is a former Tudor port and was granted borough status in 1529 by Henry VIII. 

Aldeburgh Festival<====>99635<====>Aldeburgh Festival  The Aldeburgh Festival of Music and the Arts is an English arts festival devoted mainly to classical music. It takes place each June in the Aldeburgh area of Suffolk, centred on Snape Maltings Concert Hall.History of the Aldeburgh FestivalThe Festival was founded in 1948 by the composer Benjamin Britten, the singer Peter Pears and the librettist/producer Eric Crozier. Their work with the English Opera Group (which they had founded with designer John Piper in 1947) frequently took them away from home, and it was while they were on tour in Switzerland with Albert Herring and The Rape of Lucretia in August of that year, that Peter Pears said "Why not make our own Festival?  A modest Festival with a few concerts given by friends?  Why not have an Aldeburgh Festival?"  The English Opera Group would provide a core programme of opera productions, but the vision was soon widened to include readings of poetry, literature, drama, lectures and exhibitions of art. The first festival was held from 5–13 June 1948 and used the Aldeburgh Jubilee Hall, a few doors away from Britten's house in Crabbe Street, as its main venue, with performances in other venues such as Aldeburgh's fifteenth-century Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. It featured a performance of Albert Herring by the English Opera Group; Britten's newly written Saint Nicolas; and performances by Clifford Curzon and the Zorian String Quartet.Over the years the festival grew and took in additional venues in nearby Orford, Blythburgh and Framlingham. However, the lack of a large venue was holding back the further development of the Festival until one of the largest mid-nineteenth-century maltings in East Anglia, at Snape, a village just outside Aldeburgh, became available.  Britten, who had lived in Snape in the 1930s, had the vision that the largest of the malthouses could be converted into a Concert Hall. Most of the building's original character, such as the distinctive square malthouse roof-vents, was retained. The new concert hall was opened by the Queen on 2 June 1967, at the start of the twentieth Aldeburgh Festival.Two years later, on the first night of the 1969 Festival, the concert hall was destroyed by fire. Only the shell of the outer walls remained. For that year the Festival was moved to other local venues and only one performance was lost. By the following year the hall had been rebuilt and once again it was opened in the presence of the Queen, this time at the start of the 1970 Festival. The new Concert Hall at Snape Maltings became the main focus for the Aldeburgh Festival, although performances continued to be held at all the former venues.For the first six years of the Aldeburgh Festival, the joint Artistic Directors remained Britten, Pears and Crozier; in 1955, Britten and Pears were in sole charge, then the following year they were joined by Imogen Holst, who remained a member of the Artistic Directorate until her death in 1984.  After Britten's own death in 1976, the artistic direction of the Festival was shared; many world-class musicians joined the artistic team, including at various times Philip Ledger, Colin Graham, Steuart Bedford, Mstislav Rostropovich, Murray Perahia, Simon Rattle, John Shirley-Quirk and Oliver Knussen.  In 1999, a sole Artistic Director in the Britten mould – composer, solo performer, accompanist and conductor – was appointed in Thomas Adès, joined in 2004 by composer John Woolrich, first as Guest Artistic Director then as an Associate Artistic Director. Thomas Adès was succeeded as Artistic Director of the Festival by Pierre-Laurent Aimard in 2009.From the beginning, the Festivals were characterised by an eclectic range of music, from the classics – Bach, Haydn, Mozart – to contemporary work, with young composers in particular being commissioned. By 1982, Britten–Pears archivist Rosamund Strode calculated that the Festival had to that date presented new works by over 75 composers, with world premieres of 15 operas.  Concert goers were over the ensuing years to see new works not only by Britten himself, but by composers such as Lennox Berkeley, Richard Rodney Bennett, Elliott Carter, Hans Werner Henze, Alfred Schnittke, Toru Takemitsu, Michael Tippett, Mark-Anthony Turnage and Malcolm Williamson, many of whom came to the Festival as composer-in-residence.  Later, young composers continued to be encouraged with the foundation of the biennial Benjamin Britten Composers' Competition.  Many new works were presented under the baton of Oliver Knussen, himself a notable contributor to the new works presented at the Festival.Imogen Holst introduced early choral music, and soon works by European composers rarely heard at that time in England were in the repertoire, such as Berg, Mahler, Schoenberg, Poulenc, Boulez, and Webern.  Later, Copland, Dutilleux, Lutoslawski and Kodály were to come to the Festival. In contrast, John Dankworth and Cleo Laine, Joyce Grenfell, Peggy Ashcroft and actors from the Royal Shakespeare Company made regular appearances; Princess Grace of Monaco came to take part in a poetry recital.  Richter played for Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.The size and capacity of the Concert Hall enabled the Festival to present full-scale orchestras for the first time, and for many years Simon Rattle brought his City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra to Snape. There was a strong connection with Russian music: Rostropovich and Richter became frequent visitors, and in 1970 Shostakovich's 14th Symphony – dedicated to Britten – had its first performance outside the USSR at the Concert Hall.Peter Pears, in addition to his role as joint Artistic Director, was a regular performer, often accompanied by Britten, and often appearing in up to ten concerts during the Festival. Janet Baker, Julian Bream, Osian Ellis, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, John Shirley-Quirk and Robert Tear were among the regular performers in the early days, followed later by Alfred Brendel, Ian Bostridge, Thomas Allen, Philip Langridge and Ann Murray.The Concert Hall proved very capable of being turned into an opera stage.  The Royal Opera presented A Midsummer Night's Dream in the first season, and on 16 June 1973, the first performance of Britten's final opera, Death in Venice, was given at the Concert Hall, with Pears in the role of Aschenbach.  In 1976, in what was to be Britten's last Festival, Janet Baker sang the premiere of his dramatic cantata Phaedra in a festival that included performances by André Previn, Elisabeth Söderström, Sviatoslav Richter and the entire Rostropovich family.In 1979, Rostropovich conducted the Britten–Pears School in a performance of Eugene Onegin (with Pears as guest in the role of M. Triquet, and Eric Crozier as the valet Guillot).  In subsequent years, the School regularly performed an opera during the Festival.The festival todayThe organisation responsible for running the Aldeburgh Festival changed its name to Aldeburgh Music in 2006.Thomas Adès was succeeded as Artistic Director of the Festival by Pierre-Laurent Aimard in 2009. In 2009, a suite of new spaces at Snape Maltings, including the Hoffmann Building's Britten Studio and the Jerwood Kiln Studio, was opened with the premiere performance of Harrison Birtwistle's The Corridor.The 2012 Festival had Oliver Knussen as Artist in Residence, and the typically eclectic programme  included new productions by Netia Jones of Knussen's Where the Wild Things Are and Higglety Pigglety Pop!, a concert series exploring the work of Helmut Lachenmann, recitals by Menahem Pressler, Ian Bostridge, Peter Serkin, Miklós Perényi, Dezső Ránki and the Arditti and Keller Quartets, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra with the UK premiere of a work by Elliott Carter, as well as dramatised performances with film at the Leiston Long Shop Museum, the complete screening with live accompaniment of Britten's 1930s film scores, a promenade performance of John Cage's Song Books in the Hoffmann Building under the banner of #Faster than Sound, and open-air community events on Aldeburgh Beach.The centenary of Britten's birth was held between November 2012 and November 2013, and the 2013 Festival, the 66th, featured a new production by Tim Albery of Britten's opera, Peter Grimes, the complete Church Parables in Orford Church, and new works by Harrison Birtwistle, Wolfgang Rihm, Judith Weir, Magnus Lindberg and Richard Rodney Bennett.In addition to the annual Festival, Aldeburgh Music also runs the Britten–Pears Young Artist Programme (formerly the Britten–Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies), Aldeburgh Residencies – a programme offering bespoke training and development opportunities to UK and international artists – Aldeburgh Young Musicians for exceptionally talented young people between the ages of 8 and 18, The Jerwood Opera Writing Programme, for the development of new opera, as well as an extensive education programme. Aldeburgh's artist development programmes feed heavily into the June festival and other events throughout the year.The Aldeburgh Festival retains a unique character, largely due to its location in rural Suffolk. It also continues to emphasise the presentation of new music, new interpretations and the rediscovery of forgotten music. It has seen the premieres of several works by Britten (A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1960; Death in Venice in 1973) and also Harrison Birtwistle's Punch and Judy in 1968, The Io Passion in 2004, The Corridor in 2009 and The Cure in 2015.The Aldeburgh Festival has always included the visual arts as well as music, and a number of exhibitions are curated each year to accompany the music programme.  From 2011, the main exhibition of contemporary art has been promoted under the title SNAP, at various locations around the Snape Maltings site, organised by Abigail Lane.  In 2012, featured artists included Glenn Brown, May Cornet, Brian Eno, Ryan Gander, Maggi Hambling, Mark Limbrick, Emily Richardson and Gavin Turk.References External linksAldeburgh MusicITV Local Anglia's entertainment show All Angles on Aldeburgh Festival June 2008"Big Beach Jive" – Video of Aldeburgh Festival event 2012

Surveyor 5<====>99759<====>Surveyor 5 Surveyor 5 was the fifth lunar lander of the American unmanned Surveyor program sent to explore the surface of the Moon.  Surveyor 5 landed on Mare Tranquillitatis.  A total of 19,049 images were transmitted to Earth. MissionThe mission experienced a helium leak in the system that pressurized the liquid-fuel vernier engines that could have resulted in failure.  An improvised landing sequence which started the retrorocket just 42 km above the moon (about half the usual height) allowed vernier engines to bring the craft down in 106 seconds from a height of only 1340 m (about 10% of the usual). 

Surveyor 6<====>99760<====>Surveyor 6 Surveyor 6 was the sixth lunar lander of the American unmanned Surveyor program that reached the surface of the Moon.  Surveyor 6 landed on the Sinus Medii.  A total of 30,027 images were transmitted to Earth. This spacecraft was the fourth of the Surveyor series to successfully achieve a soft landing on the moon, obtain post landing television pictures, determine the abundance of the chemical elements in the lunar soil, obtain touchdown dynamics data, obtain thermal and radar reflectivity data, and conduct a Vernier engine erosion experiment.  Virtually identical to Surveyor 5, this spacecraft carried a television camera, a small bar magnet attached to one footpad, and an alpha-scattering instrument as well as the necessary engineering equipment.

Blueprint<====>99794<====>Blueprint  A blueprint is a reproduction of a technical drawing, documenting an architecture or an engineering design, using a contact print process on light-sensitive sheets.  Introduced in the 19th century, the process allowed rapid and accurate reproduction of documents used in construction and industry.  The blue-print process was characterized by light-colored lines on a blue background, a negative of the original.  The process was unable to reproduce color or shades of grey.    Various base materials have been used for blueprints.   Paper was a common choice; for more durable prints linen was sometimes used, but with time, the linen prints would shrink slightly. 

Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner<====>99799<====>Wile E.  Coyote and the Road Runner    Wile E.  Coyote (also known simply as "The Coyote") and the Road Runner are a duo of characters from the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons.  In the cartoons, the Coyote repeatedly attempts to catch and subsequently eat the Road Runner, a fast-running ground bird, but is never successful.  Instead of his species' animal instincts, the Coyote uses absurdly complex contraptions (sometimes in the manner of Rube Goldberg) and elaborate plans to pursue his prey, resulting in his devices comically backfiring with the Coyote often getting injured in slapstick fashion. 

Quarter days<====>99801<====>Quarter daysIn British and Irish tradition, the quarter days were the four dates in each year on which servants were hired, school terms started, and rents were due.  They fell on four religious festivals roughly three months apart and close to the two solstices and two equinoxes. The significance of quarter days is now limited, although leasehold payments and rents for land and premises in England are often still due on the old English quarter days. The quarter days have been observed at least since the Middle Ages, and they ensured that debts and unresolved lawsuits were not allowed to linger on.

Tonic water<====>99809<====>Tonic water  Tonic water (or Indian tonic water) is a carbonated soft drink in which quinine is dissolved.  Originally used as a prophylactic against malaria, tonic water usually now has a significantly lower quinine content and is consumed for its distinctive bitter flavor.  It is often used in mixed drinks, particularly in gin and tonic. HistoryThe quinine was added to the drink as a prophylactic against malaria, since it was originally intended for consumption in tropical areas of South Asia and Africa, where the disease is endemic.  Quinine powder was so bitter that British officials stationed in early 19th Century India and other tropical posts began mixing the powder with soda and sugar, and a basic tonic water was created. 

Whitsun<====>99811<====>Whitsun Whitsun (also Whitsunday, Whit Sunday or Whit) is the name used in Britain and Ireland,  and among Anglicans and Methodists throughout the world,    for the Christian festival of Pentecost, the eighth Sunday after Easter, which commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Christ's disciples (Acts of the Apostles chapter 2).  In England it took on some characteristics of Beltane, which originated from the pagan celebration of Summer's Day, the beginning of the summer half-year, in Europe.Whitsuntide, the week following Whitsunday, was one of three vacation weeks for the medieval villein;  on most manors he was free from service on the lord's demesne this week, which marked a pause in the agricultural year. 

Henry Fox Talbot<====>99812<====>Henry Fox Talbot   William Henry Fox Talbot (11 February 1800 17 September 1877) was a British scientist, inventor and photography pioneer who invented the salted paper and calotype processes, precursors to photographic processes of the later 19th and 20th centuries.  His work in the 1840s on photomechanical reproduction led to the creation of the photoglyphic engraving process, the precursor to photogravure.  He was the holder of a controversial patent which affected the early development of commercial photography in Britain.  He was also a noted photographer who contributed to the development of photography as an artistic medium. 

Carbon group<====>99820<====>Carbon group The carbon group is a periodic table group consisting of carbon (C), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn), lead (Pb), and flerovium (Fl). In modern IUPAC notation, it is called Group 14.  In the field of semiconductor physics, it is still universally called Group IV.  The group was once also known as the tetrels (from the Greek word tetra, which means four), stemming from the Roman numeral IV in the group names, or (not coincidentally) from the fact that these elements have four valence electrons (see below).  The group is sometimes also referred to as tetragens because it has four electrons in its outermost shell or the valence shell. 

Perry<====>99821<====>Perry  Perry is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented pears, similar to the way cider is made from apples.   It has been common for centuries in England, particularly in the Three Counties (Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire); it is also made in parts of South Wales and France, especially Normandy and Anjou. In more recent years, commercial perry has also been referred to as "pear cider", but some organisations (such as CAMRA) do not accept this as a name for the traditional drink.   The National Association of Cider Makers, on the other hand, disagrees, insisting that the terms perry and pear cider are interchangeable.
