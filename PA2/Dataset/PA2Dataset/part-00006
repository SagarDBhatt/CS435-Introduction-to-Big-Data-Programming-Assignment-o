Communitarianism<====>43375<====>Communitarianism   Communitarianism is a philosophy that emphasizes the connection between the individual and the community.  Its overriding philosophy is based upon the belief that a person's social identity and personality are largely molded by community relationships, with a smaller degree of development being placed on individualism.  Although the community might be a family, communitarianism usually is understood, in the wider, philosophical sense, as a collection of interactions, among a community of people in a given place (geographical location), or among a community who share an interest or who share a history.   TerminologyThe philosophy of communitarianism originated in the 20th century, but the term "communitarian" was coined in 1841, by John Goodwyn Barmby, a leader of the British Chartist movement, who used it in referring  to utopian socialists, and other idealists, who experimented with communal styles of life.

Keratin<====>43377<====>Keratin Keratin (   ) is one of a family of fibrous structural proteins.  It is the key structural material making up hair, horns, claws, hooves, and the outer layer of human skin.  Keratin is also the protein that protects epithelial cells from damage or stress.  Keratin is extremely insoluble in water and organic solvents.   Keratin monomers assemble into bundles to form intermediate filaments, which are tough and form strong unmineralized epidermal appendages found in reptiles, birds, amphibians, and mammals. The only other biological matter known to approximate the toughness of keratinized tissue is chitin.

Open Shortest Path First<====>43388<====>Open Shortest Path First Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a routing protocol for Internet Protocol (IP) networks.  It uses a link state routing (LSR) algorithm and falls into the group of interior gateway protocols (IGPs), operating within a single autonomous system (AS).  It is defined as OSPF Version 2 in RFC 2328 (1998) for IPv4.The updates for IPv6 are specified as OSPF Version 3 in RFC 5340 (2008).    OSPF is a widely used IGP in large enterprise networks.  IS-IS, another LSR-based protocol, is more common in large service provider networks. 

Routing Information Protocol<====>43389<====>Routing Information Protocol  The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is one of the oldest distance-vector routing protocols which employ the hop count as a routing metric.  RIP prevents routing loops by implementing a limit on the number of hops allowed in a path from source to destination.  The largest number of hops allowed for RIP is 15, which limits the size of networks that RIP can support.   A hop count of 16 is considered an infinite distance and the route is considered unreachable.  RIP implements the split horizon, route poisoning and holddown mechanisms to prevent incorrect routing information from being propagated.

The dramatic score by Maurice Jarre and the Super Panavision 70 cinematography by Freddie Young are also highly acclaimed. 

Tang dynasty<====>43455<====>Tang dynastyThe Tang dynasty or the Tang Empire (  ) was an imperial dynasty of China preceded by the Sui dynasty and followed by the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period.  It is generally regarded as a high point in Chinese civilization, and a golden age of cosmopolitan culture.   Its territory, acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers, rivaled that of the Han dynasty, and the Tang capital at Chang'an (present-day Xi'an) was the most populous city in the world. The dynasty was founded by the Lǐ family (李), who seized power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire. 

Sui dynasty<====>43456<====>Sui dynastyThe Sui Dynasty ( ) was a short-lived imperial dynasty of China of pivotal significance.  The Sui unified the Northern and Southern dynasties and reinstalled the rule of ethnic Han Chinese in the entirety of China proper, along with sinicization of former nomadic ethnic minorities (the Five Barbarians) within its territory.  It was succeeded by the Tang dynasty, which largely inherited its foundation. Founded by Emperor Wen of Sui, the Sui dynasty capital was Chang'an (which was renamed Daxing, 581–605) and later Luoyang (605–618).  Emperors Wen and Yang undertook various centralized reforms, most notably the equal-field system, intended to reduce economic inequality and improve agricultural productivity; the institution of the Three Departments and Six Ministries system; and the standardization and re-unification of the coinage. 

Three Kingdoms<====>43459<====>Three KingdomsThe Three Kingdoms (AD 184/220–280) was the tripartite division of China between the states of Wei ( ), Shu ( ), and Wu ( ),  following the Han dynasty and preceding the Jin dynasty.  The term "Three Kingdoms" itself is something of a mistranslation, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed legitimate succession from the Han dynasty.   Nevertheless, the term "Three Kingdoms" has become standard among sinologists.  To further distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of similar names, historians have added a relevant character: Wei is also known as Cao Wei ( ),   Shu is also known as Shu Han ( ), and Wu is also known as Dong (or Eastern) Wu ( ). 

Han dynasty<====>43460<====>Han dynasty   The Han dynasty or the Han Empire ( ) was the second imperial dynasty of China (206 BC–220 AD), preceded by the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220–280 AD).  Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history.   To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to themselves as the "Han people" and the Chinese script is referred to as "Han characters".   It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (9–23 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. 

Qin dynasty<====>43461<====>Qin dynasty    The Qin dynasty ( ) was the first dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 206 BC.  Named for its heartland in Qin state (modern Gansu and Shaanxi), the dynasty was founded by Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of Qin.  The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC, during the Warring States period.  In the mid and late third century BC, the Qin state carried out a series of swift conquests, first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty, and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States. 

Zhou dynasty<====>43464<====>Zhou dynasty    The Zhou dynasty (   ) was a Chinese dynasty that followed the Shang dynasty and preceded the Qin dynasty.  The Zhou dynasty lasted longer than any other dynasty in Chinese history.  The military control of China by the royal house, surnamed Ji (   ), lasted initially from 1046 until 771 BC for a period known as the Western Zhou and the political sphere of influence it created continued well into Eastern Zhou for another 500 years. During the Zhou Dynasty, centralized power decreased throughout the Spring and Autumn period until the Warring States period in the last two centuries of the Zhou Dynasty. 

Shang dynasty<====>43465<====>Shang dynasty    The Shang dynasty  ( ) or Yin dynasty ( ), according to traditional historiography, ruled in the Yellow River valley in the second millennium BC, succeeding the Xia dynasty and followed by the Zhou dynasty.   The classic account of the Shang comes from texts such as the Book of Documents, Bamboo Annals and Records of the Grand Historian.   According to the traditional chronology based on calculations made approximately 2,000 years ago by Liu Xin, the Shang ruled from 1766 to 1122 BC, but according to the chronology based upon the "current text" of Bamboo Annals, they ruled from 1556 to 1046 BC. 

Xia dynasty<====>43467<====>Xia dynastyThe Xia dynasty (Chinese: 夏朝; Pinyin: Xià Cháo; IPA: [ ɕia ˥ ˩ tʂʰau ˧ ˥ ] )  (c.  2070 – c.  1600 BC) is the first dynasty in traditional Chinese history.  It is described in ancient historical chronicles such as the Bamboo Annals, the Classic of History and the Records of the Grand Historian.  According to tradition, the Xia dynasty was established by the legendary Yu the Great  after Shun, the last of the Five Emperors gave his throne to him.  The Xia was later succeeded by the Shang dynasty (c. 

T. E. Lawrence<====>43468<====>T.  E.  Lawrence    Thomas Edward Lawrence,   (16 August 1888 – 19 May 1935) was a British archaeologist, military officer, diplomat, and writer.  He was renowned for his liaison role during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire during the First World War.  The breadth and variety of his activities and associations, and his ability to describe them vividly in writing, earned him international fame as Lawrence of Arabia—a title used for the 1962 film based on his wartime activities. Lawrence was born out of wedlock in Tremadog, Wales, in August 1888 to Thomas Chapman (who became, in 1914, Sir Thomas Chapman, 7th Baronet), an Anglo-Irish nobleman from County Westmeath, and Sarah Junner, a Scottish governess who was herself illegitimate. 

Karel Čapek<====>43469<====>Karel Čapek  Karel Čapek ( ; 9 January 1890 – 25 December 1938) was a Czech writer of the early 20th century.  He had multiple roles throughout his career, including playwright, dramatist, essayist, publisher, literary reviewer, photographer and art critic.  Nonetheless, he is best known for his science fiction including his novel War with the Newts and the play R. U. R.  (Rossum's Universal Robots), which introduced the word robot.Oxford English Dictionary: robot n2  He also wrote many politically charged works dealing with the social turmoil of his time.  Largely influenced by American pragmatic liberalism,  he campaigned in favor of free expression and utterly despised the rise of both fascism and communism in Europe.

Nine Men's Morris<====>43472<====>Nine Men's Morris Nine Men's Morris is a strategy board game for two players dating at least to the Roman Empire.The game is also known as Nine Man Morris, Mill, Mills, The Mill Game, Merels, Merrills, Merelles, Marelles, Morelles and Ninepenny Marl  in English.  The game has also been called Cowboy Checkers and is sometimes printed on the back of checkerboards.  Nine Men's Morris is a solved game in which either player can force the game into a draw.    This board game was also played and practiced in India. 

Wars of Scottish Independence<====>43473<====>Wars of Scottish Independence    The Wars of Scottish Independence were a series of military campaigns fought between the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. The First War (1296–1328) began with the English invasion of Scotland in 1296, and ended with the signing of the Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton in 1328.  The Second War (1332–1357) began with the English-supported invasion by Edward Balliol and the "Disinherited" in 1332, and ended in 1357 with the signing of the Treaty of Berwick.  The wars were part of a great crisis for Scotland and the period became one of the most defining times in its history. 

William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne<====>43474<====>William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne   William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne,   (15 March 1779 – 24 November 1848) was a British Whig statesman who served as Home Secretary (1830–1834) and Prime Minister (1834 and 1835–1841).  He is best known for his intense and successful mentoring of Queen Victoria in the ways of politics, when she was between the ages of 18 and 21.  Historians have concluded that Melbourne does not rank highly as a Prime Minister, for there were no great foreign wars or domestic issues to handle, he lacked major achievements, and he enunciated no grand principles. 

Operations research<====>43476<====>Operations research  Operations research, or operational research in British usage,  is a discipline that deals with the application of advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions.   Further, the term 'operational analysis' is used in the British (and some British Commonwealth) military as an intrinsic part of capability development, management and assurance.   In particular, operational analysis forms part of the Combined Operational Effectiveness and Investment Appraisals (COEIA), which support British defence capability acquisition decision-making. It is often considered to be a sub-field of applied mathematics.    The terms management science and decision science are sometimes used as synonyms. 

Email client<====>43478<====>Email clientIn Internet, an email client, email reader or more formally mail user agent (MUA) is  a computer program in the category of groupware environments used to access and manage a user's email. Client is meant to be a role.   For example, a web application which provides message management, composition, and reception functions may internally act as an email client; as a whole, it is commonly referred to as webmail.   Likewise, email client may be referred to a piece of computer hardware or software whose primary or most visible role is to work as an email client.

Moulin Rouge<====>43486<====>Moulin Rouge    Moulin Rouge    ( , French for "Red Mill") is a cabaret in Paris, France. The original house, which burned down in 1915, was co-founded in 1889 by Charles Zidler and Joseph Oller, who also owned the Paris Olympia.  Close to Montmartre in the Paris district of Pigalle on Boulevard de Clichy in the 18th arrondissement, it is marked by the red windmill on its roof.  The closest métro station is Blanche. Moulin Rouge is best known as the spiritual birthplace of the modern form of the can-can dance.  Originally introduced as a seductive dance by the courtesans who operated from the site, the can-can dance revue evolved into a form of entertainment of its own and led to the introduction of cabarets across Europe. 

Probability density function<====>43487<====>Probability density functionIn probability theory, a probability density function (PDF), or density of a continuous random variable, is a function, whose value at any given sample (or point) in the sample space (the set of possible values taken by the random variable) can be interpreted as providing a relative likelihood that the value of the random variable would equal that sample.   In other words, while the absolute likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on any particular value is 0 (since there are an infinite set of possible values to begin with), the value of the PDF at two different samples can be used to infer, in any particular draw of the random variable, how much more likely it is that the random variable would equal one sample compared to the other sample. 

Rave<====>43488<====>Rave A rave (from the verb:  ) is a large dance party at a nightclub, dance club or festival featuring performances by DJs, who select and mix a seamless flow of loud electronic dance music songs and tracks.  Raves typically involve usage of drugs, such as ecstasy.  DJs at rave events play electronic dance music on vinyl, CDs and digital audio from a wide range of genres, including house, trance, techno, hardcore, breakbeat and electro-industrial.  Occasionally live performers playing synthesizer or other electronic instruments will play electronic music.  The music is amplified with a large, powerful sound reinforcement system, typically with huge subwoofers to produce a deep bass sound. 

Windmill<====>43490<====>Windmill  A windmill is a mill that converts the energy of wind into rotational energy by means of vanes called sails or blades.    Centuries ago, windmills usually were used to mill grain (gristmills), pump water (windpumps), or both.  Gregory, R.  The Industrial Windmill in Britain.  Phillimore, 2005  The majority of modern windmills take the form of wind turbines used to generate electricity, or windpumps used to pump water, either for land drainage or to extract groundwater. Windmills in antiquityThe windwheel of the Greek engineer Heron of Alexandria in the first century is the earliest known instance of using a wind-driven wheel to power a machine. 

Heuristic argument<====>43491<====>Heuristic argument A heuristic argument is an argument that reasons from the value of a method or principle that has been shown by experimental (especially trial-and-error) investigation to be a useful aid in learning, discovery and problem-solving.  A widely used and important example of a heuristic argument is Occam's Razor. It is a speculative, non-rigorous argument, that relies on an analogy or on intuition, that allows one to achieve a result or approximation to be checked later with more rigor; otherwise the results are of doubt.  It is used as a hypothesis or conjecture in an investigation.  It can also be used as a mnemonic. 

Ian Dury<====>43492<====>Ian Dury   Ian Robins Dury (12 May 1942 – 27 March 2000) was an English rock and roll singer-songwriter and actor who rose to fame during the late 1970s, during the punk and new wave era of rock music.  He was the lead singer of Ian Dury and the Blockheads and before that of Kilburn and the High Roads. BiographyEarly lifeDury was born at his parents' home at 43 Weald Rise, Harrow Weald, Middlesex (though he often pretended that he had been born in Upminster, Essex, which all but one of his obituaries in the UK national press stated as fact). 

Fairy tale<====>43494<====>Fairy tale  A fairy tale is a type of short story that typically features folkloric fantasy characters, such as dwarfs, dragons, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, griffins, mermaids, talking animals, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments.  Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described)  and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables.  The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to children's literature. In less technical contexts, the term is also used to describe something blessed with unusual happiness, as in "fairy tale ending" (a happy ending)  or "fairy tale romance".

Dord<====>43498<====>Dord The word dord is a notable error in lexicography, an accidental creation, or ghost word, of the G.  and C.  Merriam Company's staff in the New International Dictionary, second edition (1934), in which the term is defined as a synonym for density used by physicists and chemists.    Philip Babcock Gove, an editor at Merriam-Webster who became editor-in-chief of Webster's Third New International Dictionary, wrote a letter to the journal American Speech, fifteen years after the error was caught, in which he explained why "dord" was included in that dictionary.    On July 31, 1931, Austin M. 

Edith Stein<====>43501<====>Edith Stein   Edith Stein (religious name Teresa Benedicta a Cruce OCD; also known as St.  Teresa Benedicta of the Cross; 12 October 1891 – 9 August 1942), was a German Jewish philosopher who converted to Roman Catholicism and became a Discalced Carmelite nun.  She is canonized as a martyr and saint of the Catholic Church. She was born into an observant Jewish family, but was an atheist by her teenage years.  Moved by the tragedies of World War I, in 1915 she took lessons to become a nursing assistant and worked in an infectious diseases hospital. 

Ross Perot<====>43505<====>Ross Perot  Henry Ross Perot ( ; born June 27, 1930) is an American business magnate and former politician.  As the founder of Electronic Data Systems, he became a billionaire.  He ran an independent presidential campaign in 1992 and a third party campaign in 1996, establishing the Reform Party in the latter election.  Both campaigns were among the strongest presidential showings by a third party or independent candidate in U. S.  history. Born in Texarkana, Texas, he became a salesman for IBM after serving in the United States Navy.  In 1962, he founded Electronic Data Systems, a data processing service company. 

Axis of evil<====>43506<====>Axis of evil   The term "axis of evil" was first used by U. S.  President George W.  Bush in his State of the Union address on January 29, 2002, and often repeated throughout his presidency, to describe governments that his administration accused of sponsoring terrorism and seeking weapons of mass destruction.  Iran, Iraq, and North Korea were portrayed by Bush during the State of the Union as building nuclear weapons.  The notion of such an axis was used to pinpoint these common enemies of the United States and rally the American populace in support of the War on Terror. 

Axis powers<====>43507<====>Axis powers   The Axis powers ( ,  ,   Sūjikukoku), also known as the Axis and the Rome–Berlin–Tokyo Axis, were the nations that fought in World War II against the Allied forces.  The Axis powers agreed on their opposition to the Allies, but did not completely coordinate their activity. The Axis grew out of the diplomatic efforts of Germany, Italy, and Japan to secure their own specific expansionist interests in the mid-1930s.  The first step was the treaty signed by Germany and Italy in October 1936.  Benito Mussolini declared on 1 November that all other European countries would from then on rotate on the Rome–Berlin axis, thus creating the term "Axis". 

Amen<====>43508<====>Amen  The word amen (  or  )  is a declaration of affirmationfound in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament.  It is found in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim worship as a concluding word or response to prayers.    Common English translations of the word amen include "verily" and "truly".  It can also be used colloquially to express strong agreement,    as in, for instance, amen to that.  Pronunciation In English, the word amen has two primary pronunciations, ah-men ( ) or ay-men ( ),  with minor additional variation in emphasis (the two syllables may be equally stressed instead of placing primary stress on the second).

Rhodes piano<====>43513<====>Rhodes piano   The Rhodes piano (also known as the Fender Rhodes piano or simply Fender Rhodes or Rhodes) is an electric piano invented by Harold Rhodes, which became particularly popular throughout the 1970s.  Like a piano, it generates sound using keys and hammers, but instead of strings, the hammers strike thin metal tines, which are then amplified via an electromagnetic pickup which is plugged into an external keyboard amplifier and speaker. The instrument evolved from Rhodes' attempt to manufacture pianos to teach recovering soldiers during World War II under a strict budget, and development continued throughout the 1940s and 1950s.

List of hypothetical Solar System objects<====>43519<====>List of hypothetical Solar System objects A hypothetical Solar System object is a planet, natural satellite or similar body in the Solar System whose existence is not known, but has been inferred from observational scientific evidence.  Over the years a number of hypothetical planets have been proposed, and many have been disproved.  However, even today there is scientific speculation about the possibility of planets yet unknown that may exist beyond the range of our current knowledge. PlanetsCounter-Earth, a planet situated on the other side of the Sun from that of the earth.  Fifth planet (hypothetical), historical speculation about a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. 

The Three Little Pigs<====>43521<====>The Three Little Pigs   The Three Little Pigs is a fable about three   pigs who build three houses of different materials.  A big bad wolf blows down the first two pigs' houses, made of straw and sticks respectively, but is unable to destroy the third pig's house, made of bricks.  Printed versions date back to the 1840s, but the story itself is thought to be much older.  The phrases used in the story, and the various morals drawn from it, have become embedded in Western culture.  Many versions of The Three Little Pigs have been recreated or have been modified over the years, sometimes making the wolf a kind character. 

Mon language<====>43527<====>Mon language  The Mon language ( ;  ) is an Austroasiatic language spoken by the Mon people, who live in Myanmar and Thailand.  Mon, like the related Khmer language, but unlike most languages in mainland Southeast Asia, is not tonal.  In recent years, usage of Mon has declined rapidly, especially among the younger generation.Many ethnic Mon are monolingual in Burmese, and the language is classified as "vulnerable" by UNESCO.  The current number of speakers is approximately 800,000 in 2007.  In Myanmar, the majority of speakers live in Mon State, followed by Tanintharyi Region and Kayin State. 

Schist<====>43530<====>SchistSchist (pronounced    ) is a medium-grade metamorphic rock    with medium to large, flat, sheet-like grains in a preferred orientation (nearby grains are roughly parallel).  It is defined by having more than 50% platy and elongated minerals,    often finely interleaved with quartz and feldspar.These lamellar (flat, planar) minerals include micas, chlorite, talc, hornblende, graphite, and others.  Quartz often occurs in drawn-out grains to such an extent that a particular form called quartz schist is produced.  Schist is often garnetiferous.  Schist forms at a higher temperature and has larger grains than phyllite. 

Uraninite<====>43532<====>Uraninite  Uraninite, formerly pitchblende, is a radioactive, uranium-rich mineral and ore with a chemical composition that is largely UO 2 , but due to oxidation the mineral typically contains variable proportions of U 3 O 8 .  Additionally, due to radioactive decay, the ore also contains oxides of lead and trace amounts of helium.  It may also contain thorium, and rare earth elements.   OverviewUraninite used to be known as pitchblende (from pitch, because of its black color, and blende, a term used by German miners to denote minerals whose density suggested metal content, but whose exploitation, at the time they were named, was either unknown, impossible or not economically feasible). 

Hornblende<====>43533<====>Hornblende Hornblende is a complex inosilicate series of minerals (ferrohornblende – magnesiohornblende).   It is not a recognized mineral in its own right, but the name is used as a general or field term, to refer to a dark amphibole. Hornblende is an isomorphous mixture of three molecules; a calcium-iron-magnesium silicate, an aluminium-iron-magnesium silicate, and an iron-magnesium silicate. The general formula can be given as (Ca,Na) 2–3 (Mg,Fe,Al) 5 (Al,Si) 8 O 22 (OH,F) 2 . Compositional variancesSome metals vary in their occurrence and magnitude:Manganese and titanium are often present. Sodium and potassium are often present and fluorine often substitutes for the hydroxyl in the crystalline structure. 

Basalt<====>43534<====>Basalt    Basalt ( pronounced   ,   or  )  is a common extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock formed from the rapid cooling of basaltic lava exposed at or very near the surface of a planet or moon.  Flood basalt describes the formation in a series of lava basalt flows. DefinitionBy definition, basalt is an aphanitic (fine-grained) igneous rock with generally 45-55% silica (SiO 2 ) and less than 10% feldspathoid by volume, and where at least 65% of the rock is feldspar in the form of plagioclase.  It is the most common volcanic rock type on Earth, being a key component of oceanic crust as well as the principal volcanic rock in many mid-oceanic islands, including Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Réunion and the islands of Hawaii. 

Beeswax<====>43536<====>Beeswax Beeswax (cera alba) is a natural wax produced by honey bees of the genus Apis.   The wax is formed into "scales" by eight wax-producing glands in the abdominal segments of worker bees, who discard it in or at the hive.   The hive workers collect and use it to form cells for honey-storage and larval and pupal  protection within the beehive.   Chemically, beeswax consists mainly of esters of fatty acids and various long-chain alcohols. Beeswax has long-standing applications in human food and flavoring.   For example, it is used as a glazing agent, a sweetener, or as a light/heat source.

Ruby<====>43551<====>Ruby    A ruby is a pink to blood-red colored gemstone, a variety of the mineral corundum (aluminium oxide).  Other varieties of gem-quality corundum are called sapphires.  Ruby is one of the traditional cardinal gems, together with amethyst, sapphire, emerald, and diamond.   The word ruby comes from ruber, Latin for red.  The color of a ruby is due to the element chromium.  The quality of a ruby is determined by its color, cut, and clarity, which, along with carat weight, affect its value.  The brightest and most valuable shade of red called blood-red or pigeon blood, commands a large premium over other rubies of similar quality. 

Ruby character<====>43552<====>Ruby character   are small, annotative glosses that are usually placed above or to the right of Chinese characters when writing languages with logographic characters such as Chinese, Japanese, or Korean to show the pronunciation.  Typically called just ruby or rubi, such annotations are most commonly used as pronunciation guides for characters that are likely to be unfamiliar to the reader. ExamplesHere is an example of Japanese ruby characters (called furigana) for Tokyo (" "):Hiragana Katakana Romaji    tō kyō Most furigana (Japanese ruby characters) are written with the hiragana syllabary, but katakana and romaji are also occasionally used. 

Action film<====>43564<====>Action filmAction film is a genre in which the protagonist or protagonists end up in a series of challenges that typically include violence, extended fighting, physical feats, and frantic chases.  Action films tend to feature a resourceful hero struggling against incredible odds, which include life-threatening situations, a villain, or a pursuit which generally concludes in victory for the hero (though a small number of films in this genre have ended in victory for the villain instead).  Advancements in CGI have made it cheaper and easier to create action sequences and other visual effects that required the efforts of professional stunt crews in the past. 

Heat (1995 film)<====>43566<====>Heat (1995 film)  Heat is a 1995 American crime film written, co-produced and directed by Michael Mann, and starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Val Kilmer.   De Niro plays Neil McCauley, a professional thief, while Pacino plays Lt.  Vincent Hanna, a LAPD robbery-homicide detective tracking down McCauley's crew.  The story is based on the former Chicago police officer Chuck Adamson's pursuit during the 1960s of a criminal named McCauley, after whom De Niro's character is named.   Heat is a remake by Mann of a TV series he had worked on, the pilot of which was released as the TV movie L. 

Hindu Kush<====>43567<====>Hindu KushThe Hindu Kush ( ), also known in Ancient Greek as the Caucasus Indicus ( ) or Paropamisadae ( ), in Pashto and Persian as  , is an   mountain range that stretches near the Afghan-Pakistan border,  , Quote: "The Hindu Kush mountains run along the Afghan border with the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan".    from central Afghanistan to northern Pakistan.  It forms the western section of the Hindu Kush Himalayan Region (HKH).  It divides the valley of the Amu Darya (the ancient Oxus) to the north from the Indus River valley to the south.

Hanks is known for his comedic and dramatic roles in such films as Splash (1984), Big (1988), Turner & Hooch (1989), A League of Their Own (1992), Sleepless in Seattle (1993), Apollo 13 (1995), You've Got Mail (1998), The Green Mile (1999), Cast Away (2000), Road to Perdition (2002), The Polar Express (2004), Larry Crowne (2011), Cloud Atlas (2012), Captain Phillips (2013), Saving Mr.  Banks (2013), and Sully (2016).  He is also known for starring in the Robert Langdon film series, and for his voice work as Sheriff Woody in the Toy Story film series. 

Ghost town<====>43569<====>Ghost town A ghost town is an abandoned village, town, or city, usually one that contains substantial visible remains.  A town often becomes a ghost town because the economic activity that supported it has failed, or due to natural or human-caused disasters such as floods, prolonged droughts, government actions, uncontrolled lawlessness, war, pollution, or nuclear disasters.  The term can sometimes refer to cities, towns, and neighborhoods that are still populated, but significantly less so than in years past; for example those affected by high levels of unemployment and dereliction.  Some ghost towns, especially those that preserve period-specific architecture, have become tourist attractions. 

Lager Beer Riot<====>43573<====>Lager Beer Riot  The Lager Beer Riot occurred on April 21, 1855 in Chicago, Illinois.  Mayor Levi Boone, a Nativist politician and great-nephew of Daniel Boone, renewed enforcement of an old local ordinance mandating that taverns be closed on Sundays and led the city council to raise the cost of a liquor license from $50 per year to $300 per year, renewable quarterly.The move was seen as targeting German immigrants in particular, and subsequently caused a greater sense of community between the group.  BackgroundChicago's rapid growth in the 1840s and 1850s was due in large part to German and Irish Catholic immigrants. 

Carmelites<====>43577<====>Carmelites The Order of the Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel or Carmelites (sometimes simply Carmel by synecdoche;  ) is a Roman Catholic religious order founded, probably in the 12th century, on Mount Carmel in the Crusader States, hence the name Carmelites.  However, historical records about its origin remain uncertain.   Saint Bertold has traditionally been associated with the founding of the order, but few clear records of early Carmelite history have survived, and this is likely to be a later extrapolation by hagiographers.  CharismThe charism (or spiritual focus) of the Carmelite Order is contemplation. 

President of Poland<====>43581<====>President of Poland   The President of the Republic of Poland ( , shorter form: Prezydent RP) is the head of state of Poland.  His or her rights and obligations are determined in the Constitution of Poland.  The president heads the executive branch.  In addition the president has a right to dissolve the parliament in certain cases  and represents Poland in the international arena. HistoryThe first president of Poland, Gabriel Narutowicz, was sworn in as president of the Second Republic on 11 December 1922.  He was elected by the National Assembly (the Sejm and the Senate) under the terms of the 1921 Constitution of Poland. 

Begging the question<====>43582<====>Begging the question To beg the question is to assume the truth of the conclusion of an argument in the premises in order for the conclusion to follow.  It is a type of circular reasoning and an informal fallacy, in which an arguer makes an argument that requires the desired conclusion to be true.  This often occurs in an indirect way such that the fallacy's presence is hidden or at least not easily apparent. The term "begging the question", as it is usually phrased, originated in the 16th century as a mistranslation of the Latin  , which actually translates to "assuming the initial point". 

Teresa of Ávila<====>43583<====>Teresa of ÁvilaSaint Teresa of Ávila, also called Saint Teresa of Jesus, baptized as Teresa Sánchez de Cepeda y Ahumada (28 March 1515 4 October 1582), was a prominent Spanish mystic, Roman Catholic saint, Carmelite nun  and author during the Counter Reformation, and theologian of contemplative life through mental prayer.  She was a reformer in the Carmelite Order of her time and the movement she initiated, later joined by Saint John of the Cross, eventually led to the establishment of the Discalced Carmelites, though neither she nor John were alive when the two orders separated.

Fluorite<====>43589<====>Fluorite Fluorite (also called fluorspar) is the mineral form of calcium fluoride, CaF 2 .  It belongs to the halide minerals.  It crystallizes in isometric cubic habit, although octahedral and more complex isometric forms are not uncommon. Mohs scale of mineral hardness, based on scratch Hardness comparison, defines value 4 as Fluorite. Fluorite is a colorful mineral, both in visible and ultraviolet light, and the stone has ornamental and lapidary uses.  Industrially, fluorite is used as a flux for smelting, and in the production of certain glasses and enamels.  The purest grades of fluorite are a source of fluoride for hydrofluoric acid manufacture, which is the intermediate source of most fluorine-containing fine chemicals. 

Flux<====>43590<====>Flux  Flux describes the quantity which passes through a surface or substance.  A flux is either a concept based in physics or used with applied mathematics.  Both concepts have mathematical rigor, enabling comparison of the underlying math when the terminology is unclear.  For transport phenomena, flux is a vector quantity, describing the magnitude and direction of the flow of a substance or property.  In electromagnetism, flux is a scalar quantity, defined as the surface integral of the component of a vector field perpendicular to the surface at each point.   TerminologyThe word flux comes from Latin: fluxus means "flow", and fluere is "to flow". 

Édouard Roche<====>43591<====>Édouard Roche  Édouard Albert Roche (17 October 1820 – 27 April 1883) was a French astronomer and mathematician, who is best known for his work in the field of celestial mechanics.  His name was given to the concepts of the Roche sphere, Roche limit and Roche lobe.  He also was the author of works in meteorology. BiographyHe was born in Montpellier, and studied at the University of Montpellier, receiving his D. Sc.  in 1844 and later becoming a professor at the same institution, where he served in the Faculté des Sciences starting in 1849.   Roche made a mathematical study of Laplace's nebular hypothesis and presented his results in a series of papers to the Academy of Montpellier from his appointment until 1877. 

John Herschel<====>43592<====>John Herschel   Sir John Frederick William Herschel, 1st Baronet   (7 March 1792 – 11 May 1871) was an English polymath, mathematician, astronomer, chemist, inventor, and experimental photographer, who also did valuable botanical work.   He was the son of Mary Baldwin and astronomer William Herschel, nephew of astronomer Caroline Herschel and the father of twelve children.  Herschel originated the use of the Julian day system in astronomy.  He named seven moons of Saturn and four moons of Uranus.  He made many contributions to the science of photography, and investigated colour blindness and the chemical power of ultraviolet rays; his Preliminary Discourse (1831), which advocated an inductive approach to scientific experiment and theory building, was an important contribution to the philosophy of science. 

De facto<====>43594<====>De facto In law and government, de facto (  or   ;  , "in fact";  ), describes practices that exist in reality, even if not legally recognised by official laws.  It is commonly used to refer to what happens in practice, in contrast with de jure ("in law"), which refers to things that happen according to law.  Unofficial customs that are widely accepted are sometimes called de facto standards. ExamplesSegregation (during the Civil Rights era in the United States)De facto racial discrimination and segregation in the United States during the 1950s and 1960s was simply discrimination that was   segregation by law (de jure). 

United States Naval Observatory<====>43596<====>United States Naval Observatory The United States Naval Observatory (USNO) is one of the oldest scientific agencies in the United States, with a primary mission  to produce Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT)  for the United States Navy and the United States Department of Defense.  Located in Northwest Washington, D. C.  at the Northwestern end of Embassy Row, it is one of the pre-1900 astronomical observatories located in an urban area; at the time of its construction, it was far from the light pollution thrown off by the (then-smaller) city center.  The USNO operates the "Master Clock",  which provides precise time to the GPS satellite constellation run by the United States Air Force. 

Exciton<====>43597<====>Exciton  An exciton is a bound state of an electron and an electron hole which are attracted to each other by the electrostatic Coulomb force.  It is an electrically neutral quasiparticle that exists in insulators, semiconductors and in some liquids.  The exciton is regarded as an elementary excitation of condensed matter that can transport energy without transporting net electric charge.   An exciton can form when a photon is absorbed by a semiconductor.    This excites an electron from the valence band into the conduction band.   In turn, this leaves behind a positively charged electron hole (an abstraction for the location from which an electron was moved). 

Fjord<====>43598<====>Fjord Geologically, a fjord or fiord ( ,  )  is a long, narrow inlet with steep sides or cliffs, created by a glacier.   There are many fjords on the coasts of Alaska, British Columbia, Chile, Greenland, Iceland, the Kerguelen Islands, New Zealand, Norway, Novaya Zemlya, Labrador, Nunavut, Newfoundland, Scotland, and Washington state.   Norway's coastline is estimated at   with 1,190 fjords, but only   when fjords are excluded.   FormationA true fjord is formed when a glacier cuts a U-shaped valley by ice segregation and abrasion of the surrounding bedrock.Glacial melting is accompanied by the rebounding of Earth's crust as the ice load and eroded sediment is removed (also called isostasy or glacial rebound). 

Crayfish<====>43600<====>CrayfishCrayfish, also known as crawfish, crawdads, freshwater lobsters, mountain lobsters, mudbugs or yabbies, are freshwater crustaceans resembling small lobsters, to which they are related; taxonomically, they are members of the superfamilies Astacoidea and Parastacoidea.  They breathe through feather-like gills.  Some species are found in brooks and streams where there is running fresh water, while others thrive in swamps, ditches, and paddy fields.  Most crayfish cannot tolerate polluted water, although some species such as Procambarus clarkii are hardier.  Crayfish feed on animals and plants, either living or decomposing, and detritus.  NamesThe name "crayfish" comes from the Old French word   (Modern French  ). 

Gnuplot<====>43601<====>Gnuplot   gnuplot is a command-line program that can generate two- and three-dimensional plots of functions, data, and data fits.  It is frequently used for publication-quality graphics as well as in education.  The program runs on all major computers and operating systems (Linux, Unix, Microsoft Windows, macOS, and others). It is a program with a fairly long history, dating back to 1986.  Despite its name, this software is not part of the GNU project. Featuresgnuplot can produce output directly on screen, or in many formats of graphics files, including Portable Network Graphics (PNG), Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), JPEG and many others. 

Wassenaar Arrangement<====>43602<====>Wassenaar Arrangement  The Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies is a multilateral export control regime (MECR) with 42 participating states including many former Comecon (Warsaw Pact) countries. The Wassenaar Arrangement was established to contribute to regional and international security and stability by promoting transparency and greater responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies, thus preventing destabilizing accumulations.  Participating states seek, through their national policies, to ensure that transfers of these items do not contribute to the development or enhancement of military capabilities which undermine these goals, and are not diverted to support such capabilities. 

Bud<====>43604<====>Bud  In botany, a bud is an undeveloped or embryonic shoot and normally occurs in the axil of a leaf or at the tip of a stem.  Once formed, a bud may remain for some time in a dormant condition, or it may form a shoot immediately.  Buds may be specialized to develop flowers or short shoots, or may have the potential for general shoot development.  The term bud is also used in zoology, where it refers to an outgrowth from the body which can develop into a new individual. OverviewThe buds of many woody plants, especially in temperate or cold climates, are protected by a covering of modified leaves called scales which tightly enclose the more delicate parts of the bud. 

Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon<====>43607<====>Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon is a parlour game based on the "six degrees of separation" concept, which posits that any two people on Earth are six or fewer acquaintance links apart.  Movie buffs challenge each other to find the shortest path between an arbitrary actor and prolific actor Kevin Bacon.  It rests on the assumption that anyone involved in the Hollywood film industry can be linked through their film roles to Bacon within six steps.  The game requires a group of players to try to connect any such individual to Kevin Bacon as quickly as possible and in as few links as possible. 

William Rufus Shafter<====>43608<====>William Rufus Shafter  William Rufus Shafter (October 16, 1835 – November 12, 1906) was a Union Army officer during the American Civil War who received America's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his actions at the Battle of Fair Oaks.  Shafter also played a prominent part as a major general in the Spanish–American War.  Fort Shafter, Hawaii, is named for him, as well as the city of Shafter, California and the ghost town of Shafter, Texas.  He was nicknamed Pecos Bill.  Early lifeShafter was born in Galesburg, Michigan on October 16, 1835.  He worked as a teacher and farmer in the years preceding the Civil War. 

Jumping<====>43609<====>Jumping Jumping or leaping is a form of locomotion or movement in which an organism or non-living (e. g. , robotic) mechanical system propels itself through the air along a ballistic trajectory.  Jumping can be distinguished from running, galloping and other gaits where the entire body is temporarily airborne by the relatively long duration of the aerial phase and high angle of initial launch. Some animals, such as the kangaroo, employ jumping (commonly called hopping in this instance) as their primary form of locomotion, while others, such as frogs, use it only as a means to escape predators.  Jumping is also a key feature of various activities and sports, including the long jump, high jump and show jumping. 

Hari<====>43611<====>HariHari (Sanskrit: हरि, IAST: Harī) is the supreme absolute being in Hinduism and is often used interchangeably with Vishnu and Narayana to such an extent that they are considered to be one and the same.  Hari is usually depicted holding a padma (lotus flower), Kaumodaki gada (mace), Panchajanya shankha (conch) and the Sudarshana Chakra (discus).  Lord Hari is also called sharangapani in the Bhagavad Gita as he also wields a bow named as sharanga. The word "Hari" is widely used in later Sanskrit and Prakrit literature, Hindu, Buddhist, Jain and Sikh religions especially preceding the word Om (the word that precedes all else) as in "Hari Om". 

Pension<====>43613<====>Pension    A pension is a fund into which a sum of money is added during an employee's employment years, and from which payments are drawn to support the person's retirement from work in the form of periodic payments.  A pension may be a "defined benefit plan" where a fixed sum is paid regularly to a person, or a "defined contribution plan" under which a fixed sum is invested and then becomes available at retirement age.Pensions should not be confused with severance pay; the former is usually paid in regular installments for life after retirement, while the latter is typically paid as a fixed amount after involuntary termination of employment prior to retirement.

Pension fund<====>43615<====>Pension fund A pension fund, also known as a superannuation fund in some countries, is any plan, fund, or scheme which provides retirement income. Pension funds typically have large amounts of money to invest and are the major investors in listed and private companies.   They are especially important to the stock market where large institutional investors dominate.   The largest 300 pension funds collectively hold about $6 trillion in assets.    In January 2008, The Economist reported that Morgan Stanley estimates that pension funds worldwide hold over US$20 trillion in assets, the largest for any category of investor ahead of mutual funds, insurance companies, currency reserves, sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds, or private equity. 

Arsinoe II<====>43616<====>Arsinoe II Arsinoë II ( , 316 BC – unknown date between July 270 and 260 BC) was a Ptolemaic Queen and co-regent of Ancient Egypt.  She was Queen of Thrace, Asia Minor and Macedonia by marriage to King Lysimachus (Greek: Λυσίμαχος), and queen and co-ruler of Egypt with her brother-husband Ptolemy II Philadelphus (Greek: Πτολεμαῖος Φιλάδελφος, "Ptolemy the sibling-loving"). LifeEarly lifeArsinoë was the first daughter of Pharaoh Ptolemy I Soter (Greek: Πτολεμαίος Σωτήρ, "Ptolemy the Savior"), founder of the Hellenistic state of Egypt, and his second wife Berenice I of Egypt.  Queen of LysimachusAt about age 15, Arsinoë married King Lysimachus (who was then around 60 years old),  to whom she bore three sons: Ptolemy I Epigonos,    Lysimachus  and Philip. 

Shark<====>43617<====>Shark    Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head.  Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are the sister group to the rays.  However, the term "shark" has also been used for extinct members of the subclass Elasmobranchii outside the Selachimorpha, such as Cladoselache and Xenacanthus, as well as other Chondrichthyes such as the holocephalid eugenedontidans. Under this broader definition, the earliest known sharks date back to more than 420 million years ago. 

Black panther<====>43618<====>Black panther   A black panther is the melanistic color variant of any big cat species.  Black panthers in Asia and Africa are leopards (Panthera pardus), and those in the Americas are black jaguars (Panthera onca).  MelanismMelanism in the jaguar (Panthera onca) is conferred by a dominant allele, and in the leopard (Panthera pardus) by a recessive allele.  Close examination of the color of these black cats will show that the typical markings are still present, but are hidden by the excess black pigment melanin, giving an effect similar to that of printed silk. 

Great white shark<====>43619<====>Great white sharkThe great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), commonly known as the great white or the white shark, is a species of large mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans.  The great white shark is notable for its size, with larger female individuals growing to   in length and   in weight at maturity. However most are smaller, males measuring   and females   on average. According to a 2014 study the lifespan of great white sharks is estimated to be as long as 70 years or more, well above previous estimates,    making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous fish currently known. 

Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem<====>43620<====>Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem Melisende (1105 – 11 September 1161) was Queen of Jerusalem from 1131 to 1153, and regent for her son between 1153 and 1161 while he was on campaign.  She was the eldest daughter of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem, and the Armenian princess Morphia of Melitene. Heir presumptiveJerusalem had recently been conquered by Christian Franks in 1099 during the First Crusade, and Melisende's paternal family originally came from the County of Rethel in France.  Her father Baldwin was a crusader knight who carved out the Crusader State of Edessa and married Morphia, daughter of the Armenian prince Gabriel of Melitene, in a diplomatic marriage to fortify alliances in the region. 

Brave Combo<====>43649<====>Brave Combo Brave Combo is a polka/rock/worldbeat band based in Denton, Texas.   Founded in 1979 by guitarist/keyboardist/accordionist Carl Finch, they have been a prominent fixture in the Texas music scene for more than thirty-five years.   Their music, both originals and covers, incorporates a number of dance styles, mostly polka, but also some Latin American and Caribbean styles like norteño, salsa, rumba, cha-cha-cha, choro, samba, two-step, cumbia, charanga, merengue, ska, etc. As part of their perceived artistic mission to expand the musical tastes of their listeners, they have often played and recorded covers of well-known songs in a style radically different from the original versions. 

Spamdexing<====>43651<====>Spamdexing  In computing, spamdexing (also known as search engine spam, search engine poisoning, black-hat SEO, search spam or web spam)  is the deliberate manipulation of search engine indexes.  It involves a number of methods, such as repeating unrelated phrases, to manipulate the relevance or prominence of resources indexed, in a manner inconsistent with the purpose of the indexing system.  "Word Spy - spamdexing" (definition), March 2003, webpage:WordSpy-spamdexing.It could be considered to be a part of search engine optimization, though there are many search engine optimization methods that improve the quality and appearance of the content of web sites and serve content useful to many users. 

Control flow graph<====>43653<====>Control flow graph A control flow graph (CFG) in computer science is a representation, using graph notation, of all paths that might be traversed through a program during its execution.  The control flow graph is due to Frances E.  Allen,  who notes that Reese T.  Prosser used boolean connectivity matrices for flow analysis before.  The CFG is essential to many compiler optimizations and static analysis tools. DefinitionIn a control flow graph each node in the graph represents a basic block, i. e.  a straight-line piece of code without any jumps or jump targets; jump targets start a block, and jumps end a block. 

Daniel Chodowiecki<====>43655<====>Daniel ChodowieckiDaniel Niklaus Chodowiecki (16 October 1726 – 7 February 1801) was a Polish—and later German—painter and printmaker with Huguenot  ancestry, who is most famous as an etcher.  He spent most of his life in Berlin, and became the director of the Berlin Academy of Art. FamilyHe was born in the city of Danzig (Gdańsk) in Poland, and in a letter “in typical Berlin humor”  wrote, “that he moved to Berlin, Germany, which shows for sure, that he is a 'genuine Pole'. ”  He kept close to the  Huguenot scene, due to his ancestry.  His grandfather Bartholomāus Chodowiecki had lived in the 16th century in Greater Poland.

Cadenza<====>43661<====>Cadenza   In music, a cadenza (from    , meaning cadence; plural, cadenze  ) is, generically, an improvised or written-out ornamental passage played or sung by a soloist or soloists, usually in a "free" rhythmic style, and often allowing for virtuosic display.  During this time the accompaniment will rest, or sustain a note or chord.  Thus an improvised cadenza is indicated in written notation by a fermata in all parts.  A cadenza usually will occur over the final or penultimate note in a piece, or over the final or penultimate note in an important subsection of a piece. 

1580s BC<====>43664<====>1580s BC The 1580s BC was a decade lasting from January 1, 1589 BC to December 31, 1580 BC. Events and trendsThe Egyptians invented a new and better calendar. It is based on both the moon and a star. They observed the annual appearance of the brightest star in the sky, Sirius. This calendar was more advanced than the Babylonian calendar.Significant peopleErishum III, King of Assyria, 1598–1586 BC (traditional date), or ca. 1580–1567 BC (newer dating)Actaeus, King of Athens, first King of Athens according to the Parian Chronicle succeeded in the throne by Cecrops IDEFAULTSORT 

Georg Forster<====>43667<====>Georg Forster   Johann Georg Adam Forster ( ; November 27, 1754 Many sources, including the biography by Thomas Saine, give Forster's birth date as November 26; according to Enzensberger, Ulrich (1996) Ein Leben in Scherben [A Life in Ruins], Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag,  , the baptism registry of St Peter in Danzig lists November 27 as the date of birth and December 5 as the date of baptism.   – January 10, 1794) was a German naturalist, ethnologist, travel writer, journalist, and revolutionary.At an early age, he accompanied his father, Johann Reinhold Forster, on several scientific expeditions, including James Cook's second voyage to the Pacific. 

Johannes Daniel Falk<====>43673<====>Johannes Daniel Falk  Johannes Daniel Falk (28 October 1768 Danzig – 14 February 1826 Weimar) was a German publisher and poet. Falk was born in Danzig (Gdańsk) in the Polish province of Royal Prussia, where he received his first education against the wishes of his father, who wanted to employ the child in his business as wig maker.

Country dance<====>43697<====>Country dance   A country dance is any of a large number of social dances of the British Isles in which couples dance together in a figure or "set", each dancer dancing to his or her partner and each couple dancing to the other couples in the set.A set consists most commonly of two or three couples, sometimes four and rarely five or six.  Often dancers follow a "caller" who names each change in the figures. Introduced to France and then Germany and Italy in the course of the 17th century, country dances gave rise to the contradanse, one of the significant dance forms in classical music.

Flint<====>43701<====>Flint   Flint is a hard, sedimentary cryptocrystalline form of the mineral quartz,   categorized as a variety of chert.  It occurs chiefly as nodules and masses in sedimentary rocks, such as chalks and limestones.  The Flints from Portsdown HillInside the nodule, flint is usually dark grey, black, green, white or brown in colour, and often has a glassy or waxy appearance.  A thin layer on the outside of the nodules is usually different in colour, typically white and rough in texture.  From a petrological point of view, "flint" refers specifically to the form of chert which occurs in chalk or marly limestone. 

Edwin Beard Budding<====>43704<====>Edwin Beard BuddingEdwin Beard Budding (1796–1846), an engineer from Eastington, Stroud, was the English inventor of the lawnmower (1830) and adjustable spanner (1842). LawnmowerBudding had the idea of the lawnmower after seeing a machine in a local cloth mill which used a cutting cylinder (or bladed reel) mounted on a bench to trim the irregular nap from the surface of woollen cloth and give a smooth finish.  Budding's mower was designed primarily to cut the lawn on sports grounds and extensive gardens, as a superior alternative to the scythe, and was granted a British patent on 31 August 1830. 

Cryptocrystalline<====>43705<====>Cryptocrystalline Cryptocrystalline is a rock texture made up of such minute crystals that its crystalline nature is only vaguely revealed even microscopically in thin section by transmitted polarized light.  Among the sedimentary rocks, chert and flint are cryptocrystalline. Carbonado, a form of diamond, is also cryptocrystalline.  Volcanic rocks, especially of the acidic type such as felsites and rhyolites, may have a cryptocrystalline groundmass as distinguished from pure obsidian (acidic) or tachylyte (basic), which are natural rock glasses. Onyx is also a cryptocrystalline.See alsoList of rock texturesRock microstructureChalcedonyAgateMicrocrystallineNanocrystallineMacrocrystalline

Duct tape<====>43707<====>Duct tape  Duct tape, or duck tape, is cloth- or scrim-backed pressure-sensitive tape, often coated with polyethylene.  There are a variety of constructions using different backings and adhesives.  One variation is black gaffer tape, which is designed to be non-reflective and cleanly removed, unlike standard duct tape.  Another variation is heat-resistant foil (not cloth) duct tape useful for sealing heating and cooling ducts, produced because standard duct tape fails quickly when used on heating ducts.  Duct tape is generally silvery gray, but also available in other colors and even printed designs. During World War II, Revolite (then a division of Johnson & Johnson) developed an adhesive tape made from a rubber-based adhesive applied to a durable duck cloth backing. 

Radiation pressure<====>43709<====>Radiation pressureRadiation pressure is the pressure exerted upon any surface exposed to electromagnetic radiation.  Radiation pressure implies an interaction between electromagnetic radiation and bodies of various types, including clouds of particles or gases.   The interactions can be absorption, reflection, or some of both (the common case).   Bodies also emit radiation and thereby experience a resulting pressure. The forces generated by radiation pressure are generally too small to be detected under everyday circumstances; however, they do play a crucial role in some settings, such as astronomy and astrodynamics.  For example, had the effects of the sun's radiation pressure on the spacecraft of the Viking program been ignored, the spacecraft would have missed Mars orbit by about 15,000 kilometers. 

Silicon dioxide<====>43710<====>Silicon dioxide  Silicon dioxide, also known as silica (from the Latin silex), is an oxide of silicon with the chemical formula   , most commonly found in nature as quartz and in various living organisms. In many parts of the world, silica is the major constituent of sand.  Silica is one of the most complex and most abundant families of materials, existing as a compound of several minerals and as synthetic product.  Notable examples include fused quartz, fumed silica, silica gel, and aerogels.  It is used in structural materials, microelectronics, and as components in the food and pharmaceutical industries. 

Nichols radiometer<====>43711<====>Nichols radiometerA Nichols radiometer was the apparatus used by Ernest Fox Nichols and Gordon Ferrie Hull in 1901 for the measurement of radiation pressure.  It consisted of a pair of small silvered glass mirrors suspended in the manner of a torsion balance by a fine quartz fibre within an enclosure in which the air pressure could be regulated.  The torsion head to which the fiber was attached could be turned from the outside by means of a magnet.  A beam of light was directed first on one mirror and then on the other, and the opposite deflections observed with mirror and scale. 

Parsi<====>43712<====>Parsi  Parsi   (or Parsee) is one of two Zoroastrian communities (the other being Iranis) majorly located in India and few in Pakistan.  According to the Qissa-i Sanjan, Parsis migrated from Greater Iran to Sindh and Gujarat, where they were given refuge, between the 8th and 10th century CE to avoid persecution following the Arab conquest of Persia.  At the time of the Muslim conquest of Persia, the dominant religion of the region (which was ruled by the Sasanian Empire) was Zoroastrianism. 

John McCain<====>43715<====>John McCain   John Sidney McCain III (born August 29, 1936)  is an American politician serving as the senior United States Senator from Arizona since 1987.

Naval Academy in 1958 and followed his father and grandfather—both four-star admirals—into the United States Navy.  He became a naval aviator and flew ground-attack aircraft from aircraft carriers.  During the Vietnam War, he was almost killed in the 1967 USS Forrestal fire. 

Prisoner's dilemma<====>43717<====>Prisoner's dilemma Prisoner's dilemma payoff matrix  B stays silent B betrays A stays silentA betraysThe prisoner's dilemma is a standard example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two completely "rational" individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so.  It was originally framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher working at RAND in 1950.  Albert W.  Tucker formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and named it, "prisoner's dilemma" (Poundstone, 1992), presenting it as follows: It is implied that the prisoners will have no opportunity to reward or punish their partner other than the prison sentences they get, and that their decision will not affect their reputation in the future. 

Sport of athletics<====>43719<====>Sport of athletics  Athletics is a collection of sporting events that involve competitive running, jumping, throwing, and walking.   The most common types of athletics competitions are track and field, road running, cross country running, and race walking. The results of racing events are decided by finishing position (or time, where measured), while the jumps and throws are won by the athlete that achieves the highest or furthest measurement from a series of attempts.  The simplicity of the competitions, and the lack of a need for expensive equipment, makes athletics one of the most commonly competed sports in the world. 

Hammer throw<====>43720<====>Hammer throw The hammer throw is one of the four throwing events in regular track and field competitions, along with the discus throw, shot put and javelin.

The size of the ball varies between men's and women's competitions (see Competition section below for details). HistoryWith roots dating back to the 15th century, the contemporary version of the hammer throw is one of the oldest of Olympic Games competitions, first included at the 1900 games in Paris, France (the second Olympiad of the modern era). 

Decathlon<====>43722<====>Decathlon   The decathlon is a combined event in athletics consisting of ten track and field events.  The word decathlon is of Greek origin, from δέκα (déka, meaning "ten") and ἄθλος (áthlos, or ἄθλον, áthlon, meaning "feat").  Events are held over two consecutive days and the winners are determined by the combined performance in all.  Performance is judged on a points system in each event, not by the position achieved.The decathlon is contested mainly by male athletes, while female athletes typically compete in the heptathlon. Traditionally, the title of "World's Greatest Athlete" has been given to the person who wins the Olympic decathlon.

Whigs (British political party)<====>43729<====>Whigs (British political party)   The Whigs were a political faction and then a political party in the parliaments of England, Scotland, Great Britain, Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Between the 1680s and 1850s, they contested power with their rivals, the Tories.  The Whigs' origin lay in constitutional monarchism and opposition to absolute monarchy.  The Whigs played a central role in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and were the standing enemies of the Stuart kings and pretenders, who were Roman Catholic.  The Whigs took full control of the government in 1715 and remained totally dominant until King George III, coming to the throne in 1760, allowed Tories back in. 

Linear programming<====>43730<====>Linear programmingLinear programming (LP, also called linear optimization) is a method to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships.

Social norm<====>43851<====>Social norm  From a sociological perspective, social norms are informal understandings that govern the behavior of members of a society.  Marshall, G.  Oxford Dictionary of Sociology  Social psychology recognizes smaller group units, such as a team or an office, may also endorse norms separately or in addition to cultural or societal expectations.  Jackson, J.  (1965).  "Structural characteristics of norms".  In I. D.  Steiner & M.  Fishbein (Eds. ), Current studies in social psychology (pp.  301-309).

Reality<====>43854<====>Reality   Reality is the state of things as they actually exist, as opposed to an idealistic or notional idea of them.   Reality includes everything that is and has been, whether or not it is observable or comprehensible.  A still broader definition includes that which has existed, exists, or will exist. Philosophers, mathematicians, and other ancient and modern thinkers, such as Aristotle, Plato, Frege, Wittgenstein, and Russell, have made a distinction between thought corresponding to reality, coherent abstractions (thoughts of things that are imaginable but not real), and that which cannot even be rationally thought.  By contrast, existence is often restricted solely to that which has physical existence or has a direct basis in it in the way that thoughts do in the brain.

Lake-effect snow<====>43864<====>Lake-effect snow  Lake-effect snow is produced during cooler atmospheric conditions when a cold air mass moves across long expanses of warmer lake water, warming the lower layer of air which picks up water vapor from the lake, rises up through the colder air above, freezes and is deposited on the leeward (downwind) shores.  The same effect also occurs over bodies of salt water, when it is termed ocean-effect or bay-effect snow.  The effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic influence of higher elevations on the downwind shores.  This uplifting can produce narrow but very intense bands of precipitation, which deposit at a rate of many inches of snow each hour, often resulting in a large amount of total snowfall. 

Choir<====>43866<====>Choir  A choir ( ) (also known as a quire, chorale or chorus) is a musical ensemble of singers.

Most choirs are led by a conductor, who leads the performances with arm and face gestures. A body of singers who perform together as a group is called a choir or chorus.  The former term is very often applied to groups affiliated with a church (whether or not they actually occupy the choir) and the second to groups that perform in theatres or concert halls, but this distinction is far from rigid.

Fatal familial insomnia<====>43871<====>Fatal familial insomnia  Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is an extremely rare autosomal dominant inherited prion disease of the brain.  It is almost always caused by a mutation to the protein PrP C , but can also develop spontaneously in patients with a non-inherited mutation variant called sporadic fatal insomnia (sFI ).  FFI has no known cure and involves progressively worsening insomnia, which leads to hallucinations, delirium, confusional states like that of dementia, and eventually, death.The average survival time for patients diagnosed with FFI after the onset of symptoms is 18 months.  The mutated protein, called PrP Sc , has been found in just 40 families worldwide, affecting about 100 people; if only one parent has the gene, the offspring have a 50% risk of inheriting it and developing the disease.

Transitive verb<====>43931<====>Transitive verb  A transitive verb is a verb that requires one or more objects.  This contrasts with intransitive verbs, which do not have objects.  Transitivity is traditionally thought  as a global property of a clause, by which activity is transferred from an agent to a patient.  A verb that is followed by an object is called a transitive verb.  Transitive verbs can be classified by the number of objects they require.  Verbs that require only two arguments, a subject and a single direct object, are monotransitive.  Verbs that require two objects, a direct object and an indirect object, are ditransitive,  or less commonly bitransitive. 

Obligate aerobe<====>43932<====>Obligate aerobe An obligate aerobe is an organism that requires oxygen to grow. Through cellular respiration, these organisms use oxygen to metabolise substances, like sugars or fats, to obtain energy.  In this type of respiration, oxygen serves as the terminal electron acceptor for the electron transport chain.    Aerobic respiration has the advantage of yielding more energy (adenosine triphosphate or ATP) than fermentation or anaerobic respiration,    but obligate aerobes are subject to high levels of oxidative stress.  Examples of obligately aerobic bacteria include and Mycobacterium tuberculosis    and Nocardia asteroides. 

Intransitive verb<====>43933<====>Intransitive verb   In grammar, an intransitive verb does not allow a direct object.  This is distinct from a transitive verb, which takes one or more objects.   The verb property is called transitivity. ExamplesIn the following sentences, verbs are used without direct object:"I sneezed. ""My dog ran. ""When he finished the race, he vomited. ""Water evaporates when it's hot. ""You've grown since I last saw you!""I wonder how old I will be when I die. "The following sentences contain transitive verbs (they take one or more objects):"We watched a movie last night. ""She's eating popcorn. ""When I said that, my sister smacked me. 

Micrometer<====>43935<====>Micrometer A micrometer (   ), sometimes known as a micrometer screw gauge, is a device incorporating a calibrated screw widely used for precise measurement of components  in mechanical engineering and machining as well as most mechanical trades, along with other metrological instruments such as dial, vernier, and digital calipers.  Micrometers are usually, but not always, in the form of calipers (opposing ends joined by a frame).  The spindle is a very accurately machined screw and the object to be measured is placed between the spindle and the anvil.  The spindle is moved by turning the ratchet knob or thimble until the object to be measured is lightly touched by both the spindle and the anvil. 

Ditransitive verb<====>43936<====>Ditransitive verb  In grammar, a ditransitive verb is a verb which takes a subject and two objects which refer to a theme and a recipient.  According to certain linguistics considerations, these objects may be called direct and indirect, or primary and secondary.   This is in contrast to monotransitive verbs, which take only one object, a direct or primary object. In languages which mark grammatical case, it is common to differentiate the objects of a ditransitive verb using, for example, the accusative case for the direct object, and the dative case for the indirect object (but this morphological alignment is not unique; see below). 

Parasitism<====>43937<====>Parasitism   In biology, parasitism is a non-mutual relationship between species, where one species, the parasite, benefits at the expense of the other, the host.  Traditionally parasite primarily meant an organism visible to the naked eye, or a macroparasite (such as a helminth).  Microparasites are typically far smaller, such as protozoa,viruses, and bacteria.  Claude Combes, The Art of being a Parasite, University of Chicago Press, 2005  Examples of parasites include the plants mistletoe and cuscuta, and animals such as hookworms. Unlike predators, parasites typically do not kill their host, are generally much smaller than their host, and often live in or on their host for an extended period. 

Bacterial lawn<====>43938<====>Bacterial lawn Bacterial lawn is a term used by microbiologists to describe the appearance of bacterial colonies when all the individual colonies on a petri-dish agar plate merge to form a field or mat of bacteria.  Bacterial lawns find use in screens for antibiotic resistance and bacteriophage titering. Bacterial lawns (often of Serratia marcescens)  are also used extensively when as an assay method when using bacteriophage as tracers in studies of groundwater flow. Although occasionally used as a synonym for biofilm, the term primarily applies to the simple, clonal, unstructured mats of organisms that typically only form on laboratory growth media. 

Windows Media Player<====>43941<====>Windows Media Player Windows Media Player (WMP) is a media player and media library application developed by Microsoft that is used for playing audio, video and viewing images on personal computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system, as well as on Pocket PC and Windows Mobile-based devices.  Editions of Windows Media Player were also released for classic Mac OS,   and Solaris but development of these has since been discontinued. In addition to being a media player, Windows Media Player includes the ability to rip music from and copy music to compact discs, burn recordable discs in Audio CD format or as data discs with playlists such as an MP3 CD, synchronize content with a digital audio player (MP3 player) or other mobile devices, and enable users to purchase or rent music from a number of online music stores. 

Petri dish<====>43942<====>Petri dishA Petri dish (sometimes spelled "Petrie dish" and alternatively known as a Petri plate or cell-culture dish), named after the German bacteriologist Julius Richard Petri,   is a shallow cylindrical glass or plastic lidded dish that biologists use to culture cells  such as bacteria or small mosses.  Modern Petri dishes usually feature rings and/or slots on their lids and bases so that when stacked, they are less prone to sliding off one another.  Multiple dishes can also be incorporated into one plastic container to create a "multi-well plate".  While glass Petri dishes may be reused after sterilization (via an autoclave or one hour's dry-heating in a hot-air oven at 160 °C, for example), plastic Petri dishes are often disposed of after experiments where cultures might contaminate each other. 

Massage<====>43945<====>Massage   Massage is to work and act on the body with pressure.  Massage techniques are commonly applied with hands, fingers, elbows, knees, forearm, feet, or a device.  The purpose of massage is generally for the treatment of stress or pain. In professional settings, clients are treated while lying on a massage table, sitting in a massage chair, or lying on a mat on the floor.  In amateur settings, a general purpose surface like a bed or the floor is more common.  Aquatic massage and bodywork is performed with recipients submersed or floating in a warm-water therapy pool. 

Biofilm<====>43946<====>Biofilm  A biofilm comprises any group of microorganisms in which cells stick to each other and often also to a surface. These adherent cells become embedded within a slimy extracellular matrix that is composed of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS).    The cells within the biofilm produce the EPS components, which are typically a polymeric conglomeration of extracellular polysaccharides, proteins and DNA.    Because they have three-dimensional structure and represent a community lifestyle for microorganisms, they have been metaphorically described as "cities for microbes".Biofilms may form on living or non-living surfaces and can be prevalent in natural, industrial and hospital settings. 

Star formation<====>43948<====>Star formation Star formation is the process by which dense regions within molecular clouds in The "medium" is present further soon. -->interstellar space, sometimes referred to as "stellar nurseries" or "star-forming regions", collapse and form stars.   As a branch of astronomy, star formation includes the study of the interstellar medium (ISM) and giant molecular clouds (GMC) as precursors to the star formation process, and the study of protostars and young stellar objects as its immediate products.   It is closely related to planet formation, another branch of astronomy.   Star formation theory, as well as accounting for the formation of a single star, must also account for the statistics of binary stars and the initial mass function. 

Antipyretic<====>43949<====>AntipyreticAntipyretics ( , from anti- 'against' and   'feverish') are substances that reduce fever.   Antipyretics cause the hypothalamus to override a prostaglandin-induced increase in temperature.  The body then works to lower the temperature, which results in a reduction in fever. Most antipyretic medications have other purposes.  The most common antipyretics in the United States are ibuprofen and aspirin, which are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used primarily as analgesics (pain relievers), but which also have antipyretic properties; and acetaminophen (paracetamol), an analgesic with weak anti-inflammatory properties.  There is some debate over the appropriate use of such medications, as fever is part of the body's immune response to infection. 

Interstate Highway System<====>43950<====>Interstate Highway System The Dwight D.  Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways  (commonly known as the Interstate Highway System, Interstate Freeways, or simply the Interstate) is a network of controlled-access highways that forms a part of the National Highway System of the United States.  The system is named for President Dwight D.  Eisenhower, who championed its formation.  Construction was authorized by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, and the original portion was completed 35 years later, although some urban routes were cancelled and never built.  The network has since been extended and,  , it had a total length of  . 

United States Numbered Highway System<====>43951<====>United States Numbered Highway System   The United States Numbered Highway System (often called U. S.  Routes or U. S.  Highways) is an integrated network of roads and highways numbered within a nationwide grid in the contiguous United States.  As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, they are sometimes called Federal Highways, but the roadways were built and have always been maintained by state or local governments since their initial designation in 1926. The route numbers and locations are coordinated by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). 

Erlenmeyer flask<====>43956<====>Erlenmeyer flask An Erlenmeyer flask, also known as a conical flask (BrE)  or titration flask, is a type of laboratory flask which features a flat bottom, a conical body, and a cylindrical neck.  It is named after the German chemist Emil Erlenmeyer (1825–1909), who created it in 1860.  DesignErlenmeyer flasks have wide bases, with sides that taper upward to a short vertical neck.  They may be graduated, and often spots of ground glass or enamel are used where they can be labeled with a pencil.  It differs from the beaker in its tapered body and narrow neck. 

Laboratory glassware<====>43958<====>Laboratory glasswareLaboratory glassware refers to a variety of equipment in scientific work traditionally made of glass.  Glass can be blown, bent, cut, molded, formed into many sizes and shapes, and is therefore common in chemistry, biology, and analytical laboratories.   Many laboratories have a training programs to demonstrate how glassware is used and to alert first time users to the safety hazards involved with using glassware.  HistoryThe history of glassware dates back to the Phoenicians who fused obsidian together in campfires making the first glassware.   Glassware evolved as other ancient civilizations including the Syrians, Egyptians, and Romans refined the art glassmaking. 

Clozapine<====>43961<====>Clozapine   Clozapine, sold under the brand name Clozaril among others,  is an atypical antipsychotic medication.It is mainly used for schizophrenia that does not improve following the use of other antipsychotic medications.   In those with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder it may decrease the rate of suicidal behavior.   It is more effective than typical antipsychotics and effective for those who are treatment resistant.  It is taken by mouth.   Clozapine is associated with a relatively high risk of low white blood cells which may result in death. 

Psychosurgery<====>43963<====>Psychosurgery   Psychosurgery, also called  neurosurgery for mental disorder (NMD), is the neurosurgical treatment of mental disorder.Psychosurgery has always been a controversial medical field.   The modern history of psychosurgery begins in the 1880s under the Swiss psychiatrist Gottlieb Burckhardt.   The first significant foray into psychosurgery in the twentieth century was conducted by the Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz who during the mid-1930s developed the operation known as leucotomy.  The practice was enthusiastically taken up in the United States by the neuropsychiatrist Walter Freeman and the neurosurgeon James W.

Calorimeter<====>43970<====>Calorimeter    A calorimeter is an object used for calorimetry, or the process of measuring the heat of chemical reactions or physical changes as well as heat capacity.  Differential scanning calorimeters, isothermal micro calorimeters, titration calorimeters and accelerated rate calorimeters are among the most common types.  A simple calorimeter just consists of a thermometer attached to a metal container full of water suspended above a combustion chamber.   It is one of the measurement devices used in the study of thermodynamics, chemistry, and biochemistry. To find the enthalpy change per mole of a substance A in a reaction between two substances A and B, the substances are added to a calorimeter and the initial and final temperatures (before the reaction started and after it has finished) are noted. 

Partial pressure<====>43972<====>Partial pressureIn a mixture of gases, each gas has a partial pressure which is the hypothetical pressure of that gas if it alone occupied the entire volume of the original mixture at the same temperature.   The total pressure of an ideal gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases in the mixture. It relies on the following isotherm relation: \frac{V_x}{V_{tot}} = \frac{p_x}{p_{tot}} = \frac{n_x}{n_{tot}} V x  is the partial volume of any individual gas component (X)V tot  is the total volume of the gas mixturep x  is the partial pressure of gas Xp tot  is the total pressure of the gas mixture n x  is the amount of substance of gas (X)n tot  is the total amount of substance in gas mixtureThe partial pressure of a gas is a measure of thermodynamic activity of the gas's molecules. 

SS General von Steuben<====>43974<====>SS General von Steuben  }   SS General von Steuben was a German passenger liner and later an armed transport in the Kriegsmarine of Nazi Germany that was sunk during World War II.  She was launched as München (sometimes spelled Muenchen), renamed in 1930 as General von Steuben (after the famous German officer of the American Revolutionary War), and renamed again in 1938 as Steuben. During World War II, she served as a troop accommodation ship, and since 1944 as an armed transport.  On 10 February 1945 the ship was torpedoed by the Soviet submarine S-13 during Operation Hannibal and sunk. 

Yes (band)<====>43975<====>Yes (band)    Yes are   an English rock band formed in London in 1968 by singer Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Peter Banks, keyboardist Tony Kaye, and drummer Bill Bruford.  The band have undergone numerous formations throughout their history; nineteen musicians have been full-time members.  Since June 2015, it has consisted of guitarist Steve Howe, drummer Alan White, keyboardist Geoff Downes, singer Jon Davison, and bassist Billy Sherwood.  Yes have explored several musical styles over the years, and are most notably regarded as progressive rock pioneers. Yes began in 1968, performing original songs and rearranged covers of rock, pop, blues and jazz songs, as evident on their first two albums. 

Polish contribution to World War II<====>43977<====>Polish contribution to World War II The European theatre of World War II opened with the German invasion of Poland on Friday September 1, 1939 and the Soviet invasion of Poland on September 17, 1939.  The Polish Army was defeated after more than a month of fierce fighting.  After Poland had been overrun, a government-in-exile (headquartered in Britain), armed forces, and an intelligence service were established outside of Poland.  These organizations contributed to the Allied effort throughout the war.  The Polish Army was recreated in the West, as well as in the East (after the German invasion of the Soviet Union). 

Tórshavn<====>43979<====>TórshavnTórshavn ( ;  lit.   'Thor's harbour';  ,  ) is the capital and largest town of the Faroe Islands.  Tórshavn is in the southern part on the east coast of Streymoy.  To the northwest of the city lies the   mountain Húsareyn, and to the southwest, the   Kirkjubøreyn.  They are separated by the Sandá River.  The town proper has a population of 13,089 (2017), and the greater urban area a population of 21,000. The Norse established their parliament on the Tinganes peninsula in AD 850. 

Reading, Berkshire<====>43980<====>Reading, Berkshire    Reading (   )  is a large, historically important minster town in Berkshire, England, of which it is the county town. It is located in the Thames Valley at the confluence of the River Thames and River Kennet, and on both the Great Western Main Line railway and the M4 motorway.  Reading is   east of Bristol,   south of Oxford,   west of London,   north of Basingstoke,   south-west of Maidenhead and   east of Newbury as the crow flies. The first evidence for Reading as a settlement dates from the 8th century. 

Plumbing<====>43982<====>Plumbing Plumbing is any system that conveys fluids for a wide range of applications.  Plumbing uses pipes, valves, plumbing fixtures, tanks, and other apparatuses to convey fluids.    Heating and cooling (HVAC), waste removal, and potable water delivery are among the most common uses for plumbing, but it is not limited to these applications.    The word derives from the Latin for lead, plumbum, as the first effective pipes used in the Roman era were lead pipes.  In the developed world, plumbing infrastructure is critical to public health and sanitation.Boilermakers and pipefitters are not plumbers, although they work with piping as part of their trade, but their work can include some plumbing. 

Yitzhak Rabin<====>43983<====>Yitzhak Rabin    Yitzhak Rabin ( ,  ; 1 March 1922 – 4 November 1995) was an Israeli politician, statesman and general.  He was the fifth Prime Minister of Israel, serving two terms in office, 1974–77 and 1992 until his assassination in 1995. Rabin was born in Jerusalem to Ukrainian-Jewish immigrants and was raised in a Labor Zionist household.  He learned agriculture in school and excelled as a student.  He led a 27-year career as a soldier.  As a teenager he joined the Palmach, the commando force of the Yishuv.  He eventually rose through its ranks to become its chief of operations during Israel's War of Independence. 

Johann Friedrich Struensee<====>43984<====>Johann Friedrich Struensee  Johann Friedrich Struensee (5 August 1737 – 28 April 1772) was a German doctor.  He became royal physician to the mentally ill King Christian VII of Denmark and a minister in the Danish government.  He rose in power to a position of "de facto" regent of the country, where he tried to carry out widespread reforms.  His affair with Queen Caroline Matilda ("Caroline Mathilde") caused a scandal, especially after the birth of a daughter, Princess Louise Augusta, and was the catalyst for the intrigues and power play that caused his downfall and dramatic death. 

Evil empire<====>43986<====>Evil empire The phrase evil empire was first applied to the Soviet Union in 1983 by U. S.  President Ronald Reagan, who took an aggressive, hard-line stance that favored matching and exceeding the Soviet Union's strategic and global military capabilities, in calling for a rollback strategy that would, in his words, "write the final pages of the history of the Soviet Union".   The characterization demeaned the Soviet Union and angered Soviet leaders.  According to G.  Thomas Goodnight, the "Evil Empire" speech along with the "Zero Option"  and "Star Wars" speeches represented the rhetorical side of the United States' escalation of the Cold War. 

Royal Observatory, Greenwich<====>43989<====>Royal Observatory, Greenwich    The Royal Observatory, Greenwich (ROG;    known as the Old Royal Observatory from 1957 to 1998, when the working Royal Greenwich Observatory, RGO, moved from Greenwich to Herstmonceux) is an observatory situated on a hill in Greenwich Park, overlooking the River Thames.  It played a major role in the history of astronomy and navigation, and is best known as the location of the prime meridian, and thereby gave its name to Greenwich Mean Time.  The ROG has the IAU observatory code of 000, the first in the list.   ROG, the National Maritime Museum, the Queen's House and Cutty Sark are collectively designated Royal Museums Greenwich. 

Charing Cross Road<====>43990<====>Charing Cross Road    Charing Cross Road is a street in central London running immediately north of St Martin-in-the-Fields to St Giles Circus (the intersection with Oxford Street) and then becomes Tottenham Court Road.  It is so called because it serves Charing Cross railway station (named for the nearby Charing Cross). HistoryWhat is now Charing Cross road was originally two narrow streets in the West End, Crown Street and Castle Street.  Following the development of Regent Street in the mid-18th century, there was an increase in traffic between Piccadilly Circus and Charing Cross towards Tottenham Court Road and Bloomsbury, and the need for an improved road became obvious. 

Alyson Hannigan<====>43997<====>Alyson Hannigan  Alyson Lee Hannigan (born March 24, 1974)    is an American actress.  She is best known for her roles as Willow Rosenberg on the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997–2003), Lily Aldrin on the sitcom How I Met Your Mother (2005–2014), and Michelle Flaherty in the American Pie film series (1999–2012).

DoDD 5100. 1: Enclosure 2: a   The Secretary of Defense's power and authority over the United States' military is second only to that of the President and Congress.  Trask & Goldberg: p. 11  This position corresponds to what is generally known as a Defense Minister in many other countries.   The Secretary of Defense is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and is by custom a member of the Cabinet and by law a member of the National Security Council. 

United States Secretary of War<====>44000<====>United States Secretary of War   The Secretary of War was a member of the United States President's Cabinet, beginning with George Washington's administration.  A similar position, called either "Secretary at War" or "Secretary of War", had been appointed to serve the Congress of the Confederation under the Articles of Confederation between 1781 and 1789.   Benjamin Lincoln and later Henry Knox held the position.  When Washington was inaugurated as the first president under the Constitution, he appointed Knox to continue serving. The Secretary of War was the head of the War Department.  At first, he was responsible for all military affairs, including naval affairs. 

United States Secretary of the Navy<====>44001<====>United States Secretary of the Navy The Secretary of the Navy (or SECNAV) is a statutory officer ( ) and the head (chief executive officer) of the Department of the Navy, a military department (component organization) within the Department of Defense of the United States of America. The Secretary of the Navy must be a civilian by law, at least 5 years removed from active military service.  The Secretary is appointed by the President and requires confirmation by a majority vote of the Senate. The Secretary of the Navy was, from its creation in 1798, a member of the President's Cabinet until 1949, when the Secretary of the Navy (and the Secretaries of the Army and Air Force) was by amendments to the National Security Act of 1947 made subordinate to the Secretary of Defense.

G. ) is the head of the United States Department of Justice per  , concerned with legal affairs, and is the chief lawyer of the United States government.  Also in cases of the federal death penalty, the power to seek the death penalty rests with the Attorney General. The Attorney General is appointed by the President of the United States and takes office after confirmation by the United States Senate.  The Attorney General is subject to summary dismissal by the President and impeachment by Congress.  The current Attorney General is Jeff Sessions, who assumed the office on February 9, 2017. 

Dysphemism<====>44003<====>DysphemismA dysphemism is an expression with connotations that are offensive either about the subject matter or to the audience, or both.  Dysphemisms contrast with neutral or euphemistic expressions.Dysphemism is sometimes motivated by feelings such as fear, distaste, hatred, and contempt.  Worded simply, a dysphemism is a derogatory or unpleasant term used instead of a pleasant or neutral one, such as "loony bin" for "mental hospital". EtymologyThe word dysphemism comes from the Greek dys δύς "mis-" and pheme φήμη "speech, voice, reputation".  Related terms include malphemism (from the Latin malus "bad"), and cacophemism (from the Greek kakos κακός "bad").

The U. S.  Department of the Interior is responsible for the management and conservation of most federal land and natural resources; it oversees such agencies as the Bureau of Land Management, the United States Geological Survey, and the National Park Service.   The Secretary also serves on and appoints the private citizens on the National Park Foundation board.  The Secretary is a member of the President's Cabinet. The U. S.  Department of the Interior should not be confused with the Ministries of the Interior as used in many other countries. 

The English Patient<====>44005<====>The English Patient  The English Patient is a 1992 novel by Michael Ondaatje.  The book follows four dissimilar people brought together at an Italian villa during the Italian Campaign of World War II.  The four main characters are: an unrecognisably burned man—the titular patient, presumed to be English; his Canadian Army nurse, a Sikh British Army sapper, and a Canadian thief.  The story occurs during the North African Campaign and centres on the incremental revelations of the patient's actions prior to his injuries, and the emotional effects of these revelations on the other characters.   The book won the Booker Prize and the Governor General's Award. 

Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding<====>44008<====>Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding (ATRAC) is a family of proprietary audio compression algorithms developed by Sony.  MiniDisc was the first commercial product to incorporate ATRAC in 1992.  ATRAC allowed a relatively small disc like MiniDisc to have the same running time as CD while storing audio information with minimal loss in perceptible quality.  Improvements to the codec in the form of ATRAC3, ATRAC3plus, and ATRAC Advanced Lossless followed in 1999, 2002, and 2006 respectively.  Other MiniDisc manufacturers such as Sharp and Panasonic also implemented their own versions of the ATRAC codec. Sony has all but dropped the ATRAC related codecs in the USA and Europe and in their SonicStage powered 'Connect' Music Service (Sony's equivalent of iTunes) on 31 March 2008. 

MiniDisc<====>44009<====>MiniDisc    MiniDisc (MD) is a magneto-optical disc-based data storage format offering a capacity of 74 minutes and, later, 80 minutes, of digitized audio or 1 gigabyte of Hi-MD data.  Sony brand audio players were on the market from September 1992 until March 2013.  MiniDisc was announced by Sony in September 1992 and released in November of that year for sale in Japan and in December in Europe, Canada, the USA and other countries.   The music format was originally based on ATRAC audio data compression, but the option of linear PCM digital recording was later introduced to attain audio quality comparable to that of a compact disc. 

Anton Bruckner<====>44012<====>Anton Bruckner    Josef Anton Bruckner ( ;    ) was an Austrian composer and organist best known for his symphonies, masses, Te Deum and motets.  The first are considered emblematic of the final stage of Austro-German Romanticism because of their rich harmonic language, strongly polyphonic character, and considerable length.   Bruckner's compositions helped to define contemporary musical radicalism, owing to their dissonances, unprepared modulations, and roving harmonies. Unlike other musical radicals such as Richard Wagner and Hugo Wolf who fit the   mould, Bruckner showed extreme humility before other musicians, Wagner in particular. 

Henry Hudson<====>44014<====>Henry Hudson    Henry Hudson (  1565–1611) was an English sea explorer and navigator during the early 17th century, best known for his explorations of present-day Canada and parts of the northeastern United States.    In 1607 and 1608, Hudson made two attempts on behalf of English merchants to find a rumored Northeast Passage to Cathay (present-day China) via a route above the Arctic Circle.  In 1609 he landed in North America and explored the region around the modern New York metropolitan area, looking for a Northwest Passage to Asia on behalf of the Dutch East India Company. 

Candle<====>44017<====>Candle  A candle is an ignitable wick embedded in wax or another flammable solid substance such as tallow that provides light, and in some cases, a fragrance.   It can also be used to provide heat, or used as a method of keeping time.  A candle manufacturer is traditionally known as a chandler.   Various devices have been invented to hold candles, from simple tabletop candle holders to elaborate chandeliers.  For a candle to burn, a heat source (commonly a naked flame) is used to light the candle's wick, which melts and vaporizes a small amount of fuel (the wax). 

205<====>44019<====>205Year 205 (CCV) was a common year starting on Tuesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar.  At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Aurelius and Geta (or, less frequently, year 958 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 205 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placeRoman EmpireMarcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus and his brother Publius Septimius Geta Caesar become Roman Consuls. Hadrian's Wall is restored, after heavy raids by Caledonian tribes had overrun much of northern Britain. 

Utopian and dystopian fiction<====>44021<====>Utopian and dystopian fictionThe utopia and its derivative, the dystopia, are genres of literature that explore social and political structures.   Utopian fiction portrays a setting that agrees with the author's ethos, having various attributes of another reality intended to appeal to readers.  Dystopian (or dystopic) fiction (sometimes combined with, but distinct from apocalyptic literature) is the opposite: the portrayal of a setting that completely disagrees with the author's ethos.Many novels combine both, often as a metaphor for the different directions humanity can take, depending on its choices, ending up with one of two possible futures.

United States National Security Council<====>44026<====>United States National Security Council The White House National Security Council (NSC) is the principal forum used by the President of the United States for consideration of national security and foreign policy matters with senior national security advisors and Cabinet officials and is part of the executive office of the president of the United States.  Since its inception under Harry S.  Truman, the function of the Council has been to advise and assist the president on national security and foreign policies.  The Council also serves as the president's principal arm for coordinating these policies among various government agencies. 

Permutation<====>44027<====>Permutation  In mathematics, the notion of permutation relates to the act of arranging all the members of a set into some sequence or order, or if the set is already ordered, rearranging (reordering) its elements, a process called permuting.  These differ from combinations, which are selections of some members of a set where order is disregarded.  For example, written as tuples, there are six permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely: (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1).  These are all the possible orderings of this three element set.  As another example, an anagram of a word, all of whose letters are different, is a permutation of its letters. 

National Security Advisor (United States)<====>44028<====>National Security Advisor (United States) The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (APNSA), commonly referred to as the National Security Advisor (NSA)  or at times informally termed the NSC advisor, The National Security Advisor and Staff: p.  1.    is a senior aide in the Executive Office of the President, based at the West Wing of the White House, who serves as the chief in-house advisor to the President of the United States on national security issues.

Executive Office of the President of the United States<====>44029<====>Executive Office of the President of the United States    The Executive Office of the President of the United States (EOPOTUS or EOP) consists of the immediate staff of the President of the United States and multiple levels of support staff reporting to the President.  With the increase in technological and global advancement, the size of the White House staff has increased to include an array of policy experts to effectively address various fields of the modern day. The Executive Office is overseen by the White House Chief of Staff.    HistoryIn 1939, during Franklin D. 

Office of Management and Budget<====>44030<====>Office of Management and Budget The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is the largest office within the Executive Office of the President of the United States (EOP).  OMB's most prominent function is to produce the President's Budget,  but OMB also measures the quality of agency programs, policies, and procedures to see if they comply with the president's policies and coordinates inter-agency policy initiatives. The current OMB Director is Mick Mulvaney.  The OMB Director reports to the President, Vice President and the White House Chief of Staff. History The Bureau of the Budget, OMB's predecessor, was established in 1921 as a part of the Department of the Treasury by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, which was signed into law by president Warren G. 

Corporation for Public Broadcasting<====>44032<====>Corporation for Public Broadcasting  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is an American privately owned non-profit corporation created in 1967 by an act of the United States Congress and funded by the federal government to promote and help support public broadcasting.   The corporation's mission is to ensure universal access to non-commercial, high-quality content and telecommunications services.  It does so by distributing more than 70 per cent of its funding to more than 1,400 locally owned public radio and television stations.  HistoryThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting was created on November 7, 1967, when U. S.  president Lyndon B. 

Franco-Prussian War<====>44035<====>Franco-Prussian War The Franco-Prussian War or Franco-German War ( ,  ), often referred to in France as the War of 1870 (19 July   1871) or in Germany as 70/71, was a conflict between the Second French Empire of Napoleon III and the German states of the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia.  The conflict was caused by Prussian ambitions to extend German unification and French fears of the shift in the European balance of power that would result if the Prussians succeeded.  Some historians argue that the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck deliberately provoked a French attack in order to draw the independent southern German states—Baden, Württemberg, Bavaria and Hesse-Darmstadt—into an alliance with the North German Confederation dominated by Prussia, while others contend that Bismarck did not plan anything and merely exploited the circumstances as they unfolded. 

Solvation<====>44041<====>Solvation  Solvation describes the interaction of solvent with molecules or ions in a solute.  Ions, and to some cases, molecules, interact strongly with solvent, and the strength and nature of this interaction influences many properties of the solute, including solubility, reactivity, and color.  In the process of solvation, ions are surrounded by concentric shells of solvent.   Solvation is the process of reorganizing solvent and solute molecules into solvation complexes.   Solvation involves bond formation, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals forces.   Solvation of a solute by water is called hydration.  Solubility of compounds represents a competition between lattice energy and solvation as well as entropy effects related to changes in the solvent structure.

Oceanography<====>44044<====>Oceanography  Oceanography (compound of the Greek words ὠκεανός meaning "ocean" and γράφω meaning "write"), also known as oceanology, is the study of the physical and the biological aspects of the ocean.  It is an Earth science covering a wide range of topics, including ecosystem dynamics; ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics; plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor; and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries.  These diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further knowledge of the world ocean and understanding of processes within: astronomy, biology, chemistry, climatology, geography, geology, hydrology, meteorology and physics.

Chiricahua<====>44049<====>Chiricahua  Chiricahua (   ) are a band of Apache Native Americans, based in the Southern Plains and Southwest United States.  Culturally related to other Apache peoples, Chiricahua historically shared a common area, language, customs, and intertwined family relations.  At the time of European contact, they had a territory of 15 million acres (61,000 km 2 ) in Southwestern New Mexico and Southeastern Arizona in the United States and in Northern Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico. Today Chiricahua are enrolled in two federally recognized tribes in the United States: the Fort Sill Apache Tribe, located near Apache, Oklahoma with a small reservation outside Deming, New Mexico,    and the Mescalero Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Reservation near Ruidoso, New Mexico. 

Measurable function<====>44055<====>Measurable functionIn mathematics and in particular measure theory, a measurable function is a function between two measurable spaces such that the preimage of any measurable set is measurable, analogously to the definition that a function between topological spaces is continuous if the preimage of each open set is open.  In real analysis, measurable functions are used in the definition of the Lebesgue integral.  In probability theory, a measurable function on a probability space is known as a random variable. Formal definitionLet  (X,\Sigma)  and  (Y,\Tau)  be measurable spaces, meaning that  X  and  Y  are sets equipped with respective  \sigma -algebras  \Sigma  and  \Tau . 

MD Data<====>44056<====>MD DataMD Data (standing for MiniDisc Data) is a magneto-optical medium for storing computer data.  Sony wanted MD Data to replace floppy disks, but the Zip drive from Iomega ended up filling that market need and, later on, the advent of affordable CD writers and very cheap blank CD media, coupled with the availability of memory sticks and cards proved the final straw for MD Data.  The technology provided 140 MB of data storage, but it was slow and expensive.  Also, data drives can only read or write audio MDs when set in "play" mode, which, however, does not provide computer access to the data. 

Galactic astronomy<====>44057<====>Galactic astronomyGalactic astronomy is the study of the Milky Way galaxy and all its contents.  This is in contrast to extragalactic astronomy, which is the study of everything outside our galaxy, including all other galaxies. Galactic astronomy should not be confused with galaxy formation and evolution, which is the general study of galaxies, their formation, structure, components, dynamics, interactions, and the range of forms they take. The Milky Way galaxy, where the Solar System belongs, is in many ways the best studied galaxy, although important parts of it are obscured from view in visible wavelengths by regions of cosmic dust. 

Big Bang nucleosynthesis<====>44058<====>Big Bang nucleosynthesis  In physical cosmology, Big Bang nucleosynthesis (abbreviated BBN, also known as primordial nucleosynthesis, arch(a)eonucleosynthesis, archonucleosynthesis, protonucleosynthesis and pal(a)eonucleosynthesis) refers to the production of nuclei other than those of the lightest isotope of hydrogen (hydrogen-1,  1 H, having a single proton as a nucleus) during the early phases of the Universe.  Primordial nucleosynthesis is believed by most cosmologists to have taken place in the interval from roughly 10 seconds to 20 minutes after the Big Bang,  and is calculated to be responsible for the formation of most of the universe's helium as the isotope helium-4 ( 4 He), along with small amounts of the hydrogen isotope deuterium ( 2 H or D), the helium isotope helium-3 ( 3 He), and a very small amount of the lithium isotope lithium-7 ( 7 Li). 

Harrison Ford<====>44059<====>Harrison FordHarrison Ford (born July 13, 1942) is an American actor and film producer.  He gained worldwide fame for his starring roles as Han Solo in the Star Wars film series and as the title character of the Indiana Jones film series.  Ford is also known for his roles as Rick Deckard in the neo-noir dystopian science fiction film Blade Runner (1982) and its sequel Blade Runner 2049 (2017); John Book in the thriller Witness (1985), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor; and Jack Ryan in the action films Patriot Games (1992) and Clear and Present Danger (1994). 

Barents Sea<====>44060<====>Barents Sea The Barents Sea ( ;  , Barentsevo More) is a marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean,    located off the northern coasts of Norway and Russia divided between Norwegian and Russian territorial waters.  World Wildlife Fund, 2008.   Known among Russians in the Middle Ages as the Murman Sea ("Norwegian Sea"), the sea takes its current name from the Dutch navigator Willem Barentsz. It is a rather shallow shelf sea, with an average depth of  , and is an important site for both fishing and hydrocarbon exploration.  O.  G.  Austvik, 2006. 

Convulsion<====>44061<====>Convulsion  A convulsion is a medical condition where body muscles contract and relax rapidly and repeatedly, resulting in an uncontrolled shaking of the body. Because epileptic seizure is often a cause of convulsion, the term convulsion is sometimes used as a synonym for seizure.  However, not all epileptic seizures lead to convulsions, and not all convulsions are caused by epileptic seizures.  Convulsions are also consistent with an electric shock and improper enriched air scuba diving.  For non-epileptic convulsions, see non-epileptic seizures. The word "fit" is sometimes used to mean a convulsion or epileptic seizure. 

X-ray astronomy<====>44062<====>X-ray astronomy X-ray astronomy is an observational branch of astronomy which deals with the study of X-ray observation and detection from astronomical objects.  X-radiation is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, so instruments to detect X-rays must be taken to high altitude by balloons, sounding rockets, and satellites.  X-ray astronomy is the space science related to a type of space telescope that can see farther than standard light-absorption telescopes, such as the Mauna Kea Observatories, via x-ray radiation. X-ray emission is expected from astronomical objects that contain extremely hot gases at temperatures from about a million kelvin (K) to hundreds of millions of kelvin (MK). 

Extragalactic astronomy<====>44063<====>Extragalactic astronomy Extragalactic astronomy is the branch of astronomy concerned with objects outside the Milky Way galaxy.  In other words, it is the study of all astronomical objects which are not covered by galactic astronomy. As instrumentation has improved, distant objects can now be examined in more detail.  It is therefore useful to sub-divide this branch into Near-Extragalactic Astronomy and Far-Extragalactic Astronomy.   The former deals with objects such as the galaxies of the Local Group, which are close enough to allow very detailed analyses of their contents (e. g.  supernova remnants, stellar associations).  Some topics include:Galaxy groupsGalaxy clusters, SuperclustersGalaxy filamentsActive galactic nuclei, QuasarsRadio galaxiesSupernovaeIntergalactic starsIntergalactic dust Mark E. 

Vulcan (hypothetical planet)<====>44069<====>Vulcan (hypothetical planet) Vulcan is a small hypothetical planet that was proposed to exist in an orbit between Mercury and the Sun.  Attempting to explain peculiarities of Mercury's orbit, the 19th-century French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier hypothesized that they were the result of another planet, which he named "Vulcan". A number of reputable investigators became involved in the search for Vulcan, but no such planet was ever found, and the peculiarities in Mercury's orbit have now been explained by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity.   Searches of data gathered by NASA's two STEREO spacecraft have failed to find any vulcanoids that could have accounted for claimed observations of Vulcan. 

Avro Vulcan<====>44070<====>Avro Vulcan The Avro Vulcan (later Hawker Siddeley Vulcan  from July 1963)  is a jet-powered tailless delta wing high-altitude strategic bomber, which was operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF) from 1956 until 1984.  Aircraft manufacturer A. V.  Roe and Company (Avro) designed the Vulcan in response to Specification B. 35/46.  Of the three V bombers produced, the Vulcan was considered the most technically advanced and hence the riskiest option.  Several scale aircraft, designated Avro 707, were produced to test and refine the delta wing design principles. The Vulcan B. 1 was first delivered to the RAF in 1956; deliveries of the improved Vulcan B. 

M61 Vulcan<====>44071<====>M61 Vulcan   The M61 Vulcan is a hydraulically or pneumatically driven, six-barrel, air-cooled, electrically fired Gatling-style rotary cannon which fires 20 mm rounds at an extremely high rate (typically 6,000 rounds per minute).  The M61 and its derivatives have been the principal cannon armament of United States military fixed-wing aircraft for fifty years.  The M61 was originally produced by General Electric.  After several mergers and acquisitions, it is currently produced by General Dynamics.  DevelopmentAt the end of World War II, the United States Army Air Forces began to consider new directions for future military aircraft guns. 

Captains Courageous<====>44077<====>Captains Courageous    Captains Courageous is an 1897 novel, by Rudyard Kipling, that follows the adventures of fifteen-year-old Harvey Cheyne Jr. , the spoiled son of a railroad tycoon, after he is saved from drowning by a Portuguese fisherman in the north Atlantic.  The novel originally appeared as a serialisation in McClure's, beginning with the November 1896 edition.  In 1900, in his essay “What We Can Expect of the American Boy,” Teddy Roosevelt extolled the book and praised Kipling for describing “in the liveliest way just what a boy should be and do. ” The book's title comes from the ballad Mary Ambree, which starts, "When captains courageous, whom death could not daunt". 

John Byron<====>44085<====>John Byron  Vice-Admiral The Hon.  John Byron (8 November 1723 – 10 April 1786) was a British Royal Navy officer and politician.  He was known as Foul-weather Jack because of his frequent encounters with bad weather at sea.  As a midshipman, he sailed in the squadron under George Anson on his voyage around the world, though Byron made it to southern Chile, and returned to England with the captain of HMS Wager.  He was governor of Newfoundland following Hugh Palliser, who left in 1768.  He circumnavigated the world as a commodore with his own squadron in 1764-1766. 

Lew Wallace<====>44086<====>Lew Wallace  Lewis Wallace (April 10, 1827 February 15, 1905) was an American lawyer, Union general in the American Civil War, governor of the New Mexico Territory, politician, diplomat, and author from Indiana.  Among his novels and biographies, Wallace is best known for his historical adventure story, Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1880), a bestselling novel that has been called "the most influential Christian book of the nineteenth century. "   Wallace's military career included service in the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War.  He was appointed Indiana's adjutant general and commanded the 11th Indiana Infantry Regiment. 

Vittorio Gassman<====>44088<====>Vittorio Gassman   Vittorio Gassman, Knight Grand Cross, OMRI ( ; born Vittorio Gassmann; 1 September 1922 – 29 June 2000),  popularly known as Il Mattatore, was an Italian theatre and film actor, as well as director.  He is considered one of the greatest Italian actors and is commonly recalled as an extremely professional, versatile, magnetic interpreter, whose long career includes both important productions as well as dozens of divertissements (which made him greatly popular).  BiographyEarly lifeHe was born in Genoa to a German father, Heinrich Gassmann, and a Pisan Jewish mother, Luisa Ambron.   While still very young he moved to Rome, where he studied at the Accademia Nazionale d'Arte Drammatica. 

Electroconvulsive therapy<====>44093<====>Electroconvulsive therapy  Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), formerly known as electroshock therapy, and often referred to as shock treatment, is a psychiatric treatment in which seizures are electrically induced in patients to provide relief from mental disorders.   The ECT procedure was first conducted in 1938  and is the only currently used form of shock therapy in psychiatry.  ECT is often used with informed consent    as a last line of intervention for major depressive disorder, mania, and catatonia.  FDA.  FDA Executive Summary.

Sui generis<====>44095<====>Sui generisSui generis ( ;   ) is a Latin phrase, meaning "of its (his, her, or their) own kind; in a class by itself; unique".   The term is widely used to refer to more esoteric entities in a number of disciplines, including:Biology, for species that do not fit into a genus which includes other species Creative arts, for artistic works that go beyond conventional genre boundariesLaw, when a special and unique interpretation of a case or authority is found to be necessaryIntellectual property rights, where there is no defining characteristic Philosophy, to indicate an idea, an entity, or a reality which cannot be reduced to a lower concept or included in a higher conceptPolitics and societal norms, as above for biological classification or where there is no real authority perceived Biology In the taxonomical structure "genus → species", a species is described as sui generis if its genus was created to classify it (i.e. its uniqueness at the time of classification merited the creation of a new genus, the sole member of which was initially the sui generis species). A species that is the sole extant member of its genus (e.g. the Homo genus) is not necessarily sui generis; extinctions have eliminated other congenerous species.Creative artsA book, movie, television series, or other artistic creation is said to be sui generis when it does not fit into standard genre boundaries. Movie critic Richard Schickel identifies Joe Versus the Volcano as a sui generis movie.  Film critic Michael Brooke used the term to describe Fantastic Planet, a 1973 Franco-Czech sci-fi film directed by René Laloux. LawIn law, it is a term of art used to identify a legal classification that exists independently of other categorizations, either because of its singularity or due to the specific creation of an entitlement or obligation.  For example, a court's contempt powers arise sui generis and not from statute or rule.  The New York Court of Appeals has used the term in describing cooperative apartment corporations, mostly because this form of housing is considered real property for some purposes and personal property for other purposes. When citing cases and other authorities, lawyers and judges may refer to "a sui generis case", or "a sui generis authority", meaning it is a special one confined to its own facts, and therefore may not be of broader application.Aboriginal law and educationThe motto "Sui Generis" has been adopted by the Akitsiraq Law School because it is a sui generis (aboriginal) title in all of Canadian aboriginal law institutes by dint of its title being Inuktitut, the Aboriginal language of the Inuit in the far north of Canada. More importantly, in aboriginal professional legal education, the work of Aboriginal people to define and create contemporary aboriginal education is a thing of its own kind having sui generis admissions and sui generis curriculum. Intellectual property lawGenerally speaking, protection for intellectual property extends to intellectual creations in order to incentivize innovation, and depends upon the nature of the work and its "characteristics".  The main types of intellectual property law are: copyright, which protects creative works; patent, which protects invention; trade secret, which protects information not generally known or readily ascertainable that is valuable to the secret holder; and trademark, which protects branding and other exclusive properties of products and services. Any matter that meets such criteria is protected.However, sui generis statutes exist in many countries that extend intellectual property protection to matter that does not meet characteristic definitions: integrated circuit layouts, ship hull designs, fashion designs in France, databases, or plant varieties require sui generis statutes because of their unique characteristics. The United States, Japan, and many EU countries protect the topography of semiconductor chips and integrated circuits under sui generis laws, which borrow some aspects from patent or copyright law. In the U.S. this sui generis law is known as the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984.Statutory law In statutory interpretation, it refers to the problem of giving meaning to groups of words where one of the words is ambiguous or inherently unclear.For example, in Road Traffic law, a statute may require consideration of large vehicles separately from other vehicles.  The word "large" is ambiguous per se, but may be considered to be "heavy".  Thus the relevant legislation will (in Australian law) contain a section "Terms used" or "Definitions" which will itemise all words considered ambiguous, and confer very specific interpretations consistent with natural language.  So in this list we find the entry "heavy vehicle means a vehicle with a GVM of more than 4.5 t;" and referring upwards we find "GVM (which stands for “gross vehicle mass”), in relation to a vehicle, means the maximum loaded mass of the vehicle —" with further expansions to cover various contingencies.  Thus the term "large" is made equivalent to "heavy" and is (for this purpose) clearly defined, sui generis.Town planning lawIn English law, town planning law, such as the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987, many common types of land use are classified in "use classes". Change of use of land within a use class does not require planning permission; however, changing between use classes might not require planning permission, but not if the use class is sui generis.Examples of sui generis transference include embassies, theatres, amusement arcades, laundrettes, taxi or vehicle hire businesses, petrol filling stations, scrapyards, nightclubs, motor car showrooms, retail warehouses, clubs and hostels. The grant of private hire vehicle (taxicab) operators licences by local authorities frequently has a condition attached that the appropriate sui generis change of use planning permission is granted to those premises to ensure those businesses cannot trade lawfully without the appropriate planning consents.Even qualified and experienced town planners misconceive that changing use from an existing use class to one which is sui generis always requires planning permission; it does not because the property is not transferred between two existing use classes. Permission is only required if the sui generis use is materially different from the existing one, such as from a petrol station where petrol tanks might have leaked. As in other applications of the phrase sui generis, the decisions will be a unique matter of fact, degree, and professional opinion.PhilosophyThe expression is often used in analytic philosophy to indicate an idea, an entity, or a reality which cannot be reduced to a lower concept or included in a higher concept.Politics and society In political philosophy, the unparalleled development of the European Union as compared to other international organizations has led to its designation as a sui generis geopolitical entity. The legal nature of the EU is widely debated because its mixture of intergovernmental and supranational elements causes it to share characteristics with both confederal and federal entities. It is generally considered more than a confederation but less than a federation,  thus being appropriately classified as an instance of neither political form. Compared to other international organizations, the EU is often considered "sui generis" because its legal system comprehensively rejects any use of retaliatory sanctions by one member state against another. A similar case which has led to the use of the label sui generis is the relationship of New Caledonia relative to France, because the legal status of New Caledonia can aptly be said to lie somewhere between a French overseas collectivity and a sovereign nation. Although other examples of such status for other dependent or disputed territories may exist, this arrangement is unique within the French realm.The legal status of the Holy See has also been described as a sui generis entity possessing an international personality.In local government, a sui generis entity is one which does not fit with the general scheme of local governance of a country. For example in England, the City of London and the Isles of Scilly are the two sui generis localities, as their forms of local government are both (for historical or geographical reasons) very different from those of elsewhere in the country. In a press conference during which reporters were trying to analyse his political personality,  Huey Long stated : " . . . say that I am sui generus, and let it go at that. " SociologyIn sociology, the sui generis is what has been externalized, then internalized in the overall public and becomes a part of society that simply exists in its construct. It is not something that is not thought to have been created, because it is imbedded in everyone's way of thinking and being. Instances include the idea of love, or going to school, or clothing belonging to a specific gender. These examples are sui generis for they simply exist in society and are widely accepted without thoughts of where they come from or how they were created.

Hans von Bodeck<====>44096<====>Hans von BodeckHans von Bodeck (1582–1658) was a German diplomat and chancellor of the Hohenzollern Prince-electors of Brandenburg-Prussia. Bodeck came from a prominent patrician family of Elbing (Elbląg in Poland).  His grandfather was the burgomaster, while his father was a city councilman.  His ancestor Johann III von Bodeck (1542–1595) received imperial status from Emperor Rudolf II and was allowed to improve the family's coat of arms.  The family also held offices in Danzig (Gdańsk in Poland). In order to find a trading partner Bodeck was sent on a diplomatic mission from Elbing throughout Europe.  During that time he wrote liber amicorum, which is now studied by musicologists.

Satellite state<====>44101<====>Satellite state The term satellite state designates a country that is formally independent in the world, but under heavy political, economic and military influence or control from another country.  The term was coined by analogy to planetary objects orbiting a larger object, such as smaller moons revolving around larger planets, and is used mainly to refer to Central and Eastern European countries   of the Warsaw Pact during the Cold War or to Mongolia or Tannu Tuva between 1924 and 1990,    for example.  As used for Central and Eastern European countries it implies that the countries in question were "satellites" under the hegemony of the Soviet Union. 

Tribute in Light<====>44103<====>Tribute in Light  The Tribute in Light is an art installation of 88 searchlights placed six blocks south of the World Trade Center to create two vertical columns of light to represent the Twin Towers in remembrance of the September 11 attacks.It is produced annually by the Municipal Art Society of New York.   The two beams cost approximately $1,626 (assuming $0. 11 per kWh) to run for 24 hours.  There are 88 xenon spotlights (44 for each tower) which each consume 7,000 watts.  BackgroundThe idea of two vertical beams of light was first suggested by Ezra Orion, an Israeli sculptor, in 1997. 

Sigismund von Herberstein<====>44104<====>Sigismund von HerbersteinSiegmund (Sigismund) Freiherr von Herberstein  (or Baron Sigismund von Herberstein), (23 August 1486 – 28 March 1566) was a Carniolan diplomat, writer, historian and member of the Holy Roman Empire Imperial Council.  He was most noted for his extensive writing on the geography, history and customs of Russia and contributed greatly to early Western European knowledge of that area. Early lifeHerberstein was born in 1486 in Vipava (German Wippach) in the Duchy of Carniola, now in Slovenia, then part of the Habsburg Monarchy's state of Inner Austria.   His parents were Leonhard von Herberstein and Barbara von Lueg, members of the prominent German-speaking family which had already resided in Herberstein Castle for nearly 200 years. 

Marwan al-Shehhi<====>44106<====>Marwan al-Shehhi  Marwan Yousef Mohamed Rashid Lekrab al-Shehhi ( ,  , also transliterated as Alshehhi;  9 May 1978  – 11 September 2001) was the hijacker-pilot of United Airlines Flight 175, crashing the plane into the South Tower of the World Trade Center as part of the September 11 attacks. Al-Shehhi was a student from the United Arab Emirates who moved to Germany in 1996 and soon became close friends with Mohamed Atta, Ziad Jarrah and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, forming the Hamburg cell.  Together, after pledging their lives to martyrdom, they became the leaders of the September 11 attacks. 

Minuet<====>44108<====>Minuet A minuet ( ; also spelled menuet) is a social dance of French origin for two people, usually in   time.  The word was adapted from Italian minuetto and French menuet, possibly from the French menu meaning slender, small, referring to the very small steps, or from the early 17th-century popular group dances called branle à mener or amener. The term also describes the musical style   that accompanies the dance, which subsequently developed more fully, often with a longer musical form called the minuet and trio, and was much used as a movement in the early classical symphony. 

John Dalton<====>44112<====>John Dalton   John Dalton FRS ( ; 6 September 1766 – 27 July 1844) was an English chemist, physicist, and meteorologist.  He is best known for proposing the modern atomic theory and for his research into colour blindness, sometimes referred to as Daltonism in his honour. Early lifeJohn Dalton was born into a Quaker family in Eaglesfield, near Cockermouth, in Cumberland, England.   His father was a weaver.  He received his early education from his father and from Quaker John Fletcher, who ran a private school in the nearby village of Pardshaw Hall.  Dalton's family was too poor to support him for long and he began to earn his living at the age of ten in the service of a wealthy local Quaker, Elihu Robinson. 

Symphony<====>44114<====>Symphony   A symphony is an extended musical composition in Western classical music, most often written by composers for orchestra.   Although the term has had many meanings from its origins in the ancient Greek era, by the late 18th century the word had taken on the meaning common today: a work usually consisting of multiple distinct sections or movements, often four, with the first movement in sonata form.  Symphonies are scored for string (violin, viola, cello and double bass), brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments which altogether number about 30–100 musicians.  Symphonies are notated in a musical score, which contains all the instrument parts. 

Concerto<====>44116<====>Concerto   A concerto  ( ; plural concertos, anglicised from the Italian concerti, which is also used in English) is a musical composition, whose characteristics have changed over time.  In the 17th century, "sacred works for voices and orchestra were typically called concertos. " Wolf, p.  186  J.  S.  Bach ". . . was thus reflecting a long-standing tradition when he used the title 'concerto' for many of the works that we know as cantatas. "  However, in recent centuries and up to the present, a concerto is a piece usually composed in three parts or movements, in which—usually—one solo instrument (for instance, a piano, violin, cello or flute) is accompanied by an orchestra or concert band. 

Sonata<====>44118<====>SonataSonata  ( ; Italian:  , pl.  sonate; from Latin and Italian: sonare, "to sound"), in music, literally means a piece played as opposed to a cantata (Latin and Italian cantare, "to sing"), a piece sung.   The term evolved through the history of music, designating a variety of forms until the Classical era,  when it took on increasing importance, and is vague.  By the early 19th century, it came to represent a principle of composing large-scale works.   It was applied to most instrumental genres and regarded—alongside the fugue—as one of two fundamental methods of organizing, interpreting and analyzing concert music. 

Jelly Roll Morton<====>44120<====>Jelly Roll Morton  Ferdinand Joseph LaMothe (October 20, 1890 – July 10, 1941),  known professionally as Jelly Roll Morton, was an American ragtime and early jazz pianist, bandleader and composer who started his career in New Orleans, Louisiana. Widely recognized as a pivotal figure in early jazz, Morton is perhaps most notable as jazz's first arranger, proving that a genre rooted in improvisation could retain its essential spirit and characteristics when notated.   His composition "Jelly Roll Blues", published in 1915, was the first published jazz composition.  Morton also wrote the standards "King Porter Stomp", "Wolverine Blues", "Black Bottom Stomp", and "I Thought I Heard Buddy Bolden Say", the last a tribute to New Orleans musicians from the turn of the 20th century. 

American Beauty (1999 film)<====>44122<====>American Beauty (1999 film) American Beauty is a 1999 American drama film directed by Sam Mendes and written by Alan Ball.  Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, a 42-year-old advertising executive who has a midlife crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter's best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari).  Annette Bening co-stars as Lester's materialistic wife, Carolyn, and Thora Birch plays their insecure daughter, Jane.  Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, and Allison Janney also feature.  The film is described by academics as a satire of American middle-class notions of beauty and personal satisfaction; analysis has focused on the film's explorations of romantic, and paternal love, sexuality, beauty, materialism, self-liberation, and redemption.

Gyroscope<====>44125<====>Gyroscope  A gyroscope (from Ancient Greek γῦρος gûros, "circle" and σκοπέω skopéō, "to look") is a device used for measuring or maintaining orientation and angular velocity.    It is a spinning wheel or disc in which the axis of rotation is free to assume any orientation by itself.  When rotating, the orientation of this axis is unaffected by tilting or rotation of the mounting, according to the conservation of angular momentum. Gyroscopes based on other operating principles also exist, such as the microchip-packaged MEMS gyroscopes found in electronic devices, solid-state ring lasers, fibre optic gyroscopes, and the extremely sensitive quantum gyroscope. 

Military incompetence<====>44127<====>Military incompetence Military incompetence refers to incompetencies and failures of military organisations, whether through incompetent individuals or through a flawed institutional culture. The effects of isolated cases of personal incompetence can be disproportionately significant in military organisations.  Strict hierarchies of command provide the opportunity for a single decision to direct the work of thousands, whilst an institutional culture devoted to following orders without debate can help ensure that a bad or miscommunicated decision is implemented without being challenged or corrected. However, the most common cases of "military incompetence" can be attributable to a flawed organisational culture.  Perhaps the most marked of these is a conservative and traditionalist attitude, where innovative ideas or new technology are discarded or left untested. 

Lashing (ropework)<====>44128<====>Lashing (ropework) A lashing is an arrangement of rope wire or webbing with linking device used to secure and fasten two or more items together in a somewhat rigid manner.  Lashings are most commonly applied to timber poles, and are commonly associated with cargo, containerisation, the Scouting movement, and sailors. This word usage derives from using whipcord to tie things together.  It has been imagined that the first lashing made by humans was wrapping a few strips of bark around a stone to hold it to a tree branch to make an ax to hunt and build with. 

Plait<====>44130<====>Plait Plait may refer to:Plait, also called a braid, intertwined strands of, for example, textile or hairPlait, now called a pleat, a fold of fabric, used in clothing and upholsteryPlait (gastropod), a fold in the columella of a gastropod molluscPhil Plait, American astronomer, skeptic and blogger 

Ramallah<====>44132<====>Ramallah    Ramallah (   ) is a Palestinian city in the central West Bank located   north of Jerusalem at an average elevation of   above sea level, adjacent to al-Bireh.  It currently serves as the de facto administrative capital of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).  Ramallah was historically an Arab Christian town.  Today Muslims form the majority of the population of nearly 27,092 in 2007,  with Christians making up a significant minority. Etymology"Ramallah" is composed of "Ram", meaning height and "Allah", the Arabic word for God.   HistoryAncient rock-cut tombs have been found near Ramallah. 

Overture<====>44133<====>Overture Overture (from French ouverture,   "opening") in music is the term originally applied to the instrumental introduction to an opera.  Blom 1954.   During the early Romantic era, composers such as Beethoven and Mendelssohn began to use the term to refer to independent, self-existing instrumental, programmatic works that presaged genres such as the symphonic poem.  These were "at first undoubtedly intended to be played at the head of a programme".  History17th centuryThe idea of an instrumental opening to opera existed during the 17th century.  Peri's Euridice opens with a brief instrumental ritornello, and Monteverdi's L'Orfeo (1607) opens with a toccata, in this case a fanfare for muted trumpets. 

John Huston<====>44136<====>John Huston   John Marcellus Huston ( ; August 5, 1906 – August 28, 1987) was an American-born Irish film director, screenwriter and actor.   He wrote the screenplays for most of the 37 feature films he directed, many of which are today considered classics: The Maltese Falcon (1941), The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), The Asphalt Jungle (1950), The African Queen (1951), The Misfits (1961), Fat City (1972) and The Man Who Would Be King (1975).  During his 46-year career, Huston received 15 Oscar nominations, won twice, and directed both his father, Walter Huston, and daughter, Anjelica Huston, to Oscar wins in different films. 

Cantata<====>44138<====>Cantata A cantata   (literally "sung", past participle feminine singular of the Italian verb cantare, "to sing") is a vocal composition with an instrumental accompaniment, typically in several movements, often involving a choir. The meaning of the term changed over time, from the simple single voice madrigal of the early 17th century, to the multi-voice "cantata da camera" and the "cantata da chiesa" of the later part of that century, from the more substantial dramatic forms of the 18th century to the usually sacred-texted 19th-century cantata, which was effectively a type of short oratorio.   Cantatas for use in the liturgy of church services are called church cantata or sacred cantata; other cantatas can be indicated as secular cantata. 

Metric system<====>44142<====>Metric system The metric system is an internationally adopted decimal system of measurement.  It is in widespread use, and where it is used, it is the only or most common system of weights and measures.   It is now known as the International system of units (SI).   It is used to measure everyday things such as a sack of flour, the height of a person, a tank of petrol, and the speed of a car.   It is also used in science, industry and trade. In its modern form, it consists of a set of electromechanical base units including meter for length, kilogram for mass, second for time and ampere as an electrical unit, and a few others, which together with their derived units, can measure any useful quantity. 

Interquartile mean<====>44145<====>Interquartile mean The interquartile mean (IQM) (or midmean) is a statistical measure of central tendency based on the truncated mean of the interquartile range.  The IQM is very similar to the scoring method used in sports that are evaluated by a panel of judges: discard the lowest and the highest scores; calculate the mean value of the remaining scores. CalculationIn calculation of the IQM, only the data in the second and third quartiles is used (as in the interquartile range), and the lowest 25% and the highest 25% of the scores are discarded.  These points are called the first and third quartiles,   hence the name of the IQM.

Kill Doctor Lucky<====>44153<====>Kill Doctor Lucky   Kill Doctor Lucky is a humorous board game designed by James Ernest and released in 1996 by Cheapass Games.   In 1998, Kill Doctor Lucky won the Origins Award for Best Abstract Board Game of 1997.  Kill Doctor Lucky is, in concept, a sort of inversion and perhaps a parody of Cluedo (Clue in North America).  Both games are set in a sprawling mansion full of colorfully named rooms, feature a variety of dangerous weapons, and deal with the murder of the mansion's owner.  Cluedo begins after the murder has been committed, and players compete to solve it; Kill Doctor Lucky ends with the murder, and players compete to commit it. 

Catherine de' Medici<====>44154<====>Catherine de' Medici  Catherine de' Medici (Italian: Caterina de' Medici  ; French: Catherine de Médicis  , 13 April 1519 – 5 January 1589), daughter of Lorenzo II de' Medici and of Madeleine de La Tour d'Auvergne, was an Italian noblewoman who was queen of France from 1547 until 1559, as the wife of King Henry II.  As the mother of kings Francis II, Charles IX and Henry III, she had extensive, if at times varying, influence in the political life of France.  For a time, she ruled France as regent. In 1533, at the age of fourteen, Catherine married Henry, second son of King Francis I and Queen Claude of France. 

Conservative force<====>44158<====>Conservative force A conservative force  is a force with the property that the total work done in moving a particle between two points is independent of the taken path.    Equivalently, if a particle travels in a closed loop, the net work done (the sum of the force acting along the path multiplied by the displacement) by a conservative force is zero.    A conservative force is dependent only on the position of the object.   If a force is conservative, it is possible to assign a numerical value for the potential at any point. 

Sauk people<====>44160<====>Sauk people  The Sac or Sauk are a group of Native Americans of the Eastern Woodlands culture group.   Their autonym is oθaakiiwaki, and their exonym is Ozaagii(-wag) in Ojibwe.   The latter name was transliterated into French and English by colonists of those cultures. Today they have three federally recognized tribes, together with the Meskwaki (Fox), located in Iowa, Oklahoma and Kansas. HistoryThe Sauk, an Algonquian languages people, are believed to have developed as a people along the St.  Lawrence River.  They were driven by pressure from other tribes, especially the powerful Iroquois League or Haudenosaunee. 

Cluedo<====>44165<====>CluedoCluedo ( )—known as Clue in North America—is a murder mystery game for three to six players, devised by Anthony E.  Pratt from Birmingham, England.  The game was first manufactured by Waddingtons in the UK in 1949.  Since then, it has been relaunched and updated several times, and it is currently owned and published by the American game and toy company Hasbro.  The object of the game is to determine who murdered the game's victim ("Dr.  Black" in the UK version and "Mr.  Boddy" in North American versions), where the crime took place, and which weapon was used. 

House of Medici<====>44175<====>House of Medici  The House of Medici (   ;  ) was an Italian banking family, political dynasty and later royal house that first began to gather prominence under Cosimo de' Medici in the Republic of Florence during the first half of the 15th century.  The family originated in the Mugello region of Tuscany, gradually rising until they were able to fund the Medici Bank.  The bank was the largest in Europe during the 15th century, seeing the Medici gain political power in Florence — though officially they remained citizens rather than monarchs. The Medici produced three Popes of the Catholic Church: Pope Leo X (1513–1521), Pope Clement VII (1523–1534), and Pope Leo XI (1605);  two regent queens of France—Catherine de' Medici (1547–1559) and Marie de' Medici (1600–1610). 

Hanlon's razor<====>44178<====>Hanlon's razorHanlon's razor is an aphorism expressed in various ways including "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. "   It recommends a way of eliminating unlikely explanations for a phenomenon (a philosophical razor). As an eponymous law, it may have been named after Robert J.  Hanlon.  There are also earlier sayings that convey the same idea dating back at least as far as Goethe in 1774. Origins and etymologyInspired by Occam's razor,  the aphorism was popularized in this form and under this name by the Jargon File, a glossary of computer programmer slang. 

Satellite temperature measurements<====>44179<====>Satellite temperature measurements Satellite temperature measurements are inferences  of the temperature of the atmosphere at various altitudes as well as sea and land surface temperatures obtained from radiometric measurements by satellites.  These measurements can be used to locate weather fronts, monitor the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, determine the strength of tropical cyclones, study urban heat islands and monitor the global climate.  Wildfires, volcanos, and industrial hot spots can also be found via thermal imaging from weather satellites. Weather satellites do not measure temperature directly.  They measure radiances in various wavelength bands.  Since 1978 microwave sounding units (MSUs) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration polar orbiting satellites have measured the intensity of upwelling microwave radiation from atmospheric oxygen, which is related to the temperature of broad vertical layers of the atmosphere. 

Ozone depletion<====>44183<====>Ozone depletion   Ozone depletion describes two related phenomena observed since the late 1970s: a steady decline of about four percent in the total amount of ozone in Earth's stratosphere (the ozone layer), and a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric ozone around Earth's polar regions.   The latter phenomenon is referred to as the ozone hole.  There are also springtime polar tropospheric ozone depletion events in addition to these stratospheric phenomena. The main cause of ozone depletion and the ozone hole is man-made chemicals, especially man-made halocarbon refrigerants, solvents, propellants, and foam-blowing agents (chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs), HCFCs, halons),  referred to as ozone-depleting substances (ODS). 

Sound effect<====>44187<====>Sound effect Sound effects (or audio effects) are artificially created or enhanced sounds, or sound processes used to emphasize artistic or other content of films, television shows, live performance, animation, video games, music, or other media.  In motion picture and television production, a sound effect is a sound recorded and presented to make a specific storytelling or creative point without the use of dialogue or music.   The term often refers to a process applied to a recording, without necessarily referring to the recording itself.  In professional motion picture and television production, dialogue, music, and sound effects recordings are treated as separate elements. 

Reciprocal altruism<====>44189<====>Reciprocal altruismIn evolutionary biology, reciprocal altruism is a behaviour whereby an organism acts in a manner that temporarily reduces its fitness while increasing another organism's fitness, with the expectation that the other organism will act in a similar manner at a later time.  The concept was initially developed by Robert Trivers to explain the evolution of cooperation as instances of mutually altruistic acts.  The concept is close to the strategy of "tit for tat" used in game theory. TheoryThe concept of "reciprocal altruism", as introduced by Trivers, suggests that altruism, defined as an act of helping another individual while incurring some cost for this act, could have evolved since it might be beneficial to incur this cost if there is a chance of being in a reverse situation where the individual who was helped before may perform an altruistic act towards the individual who helped them initially. 

The Selfish Gene<====>44190<====>The Selfish GeneThe Selfish Gene is a 1976 book on evolution by Richard Dawkins, in which the author builds upon the principal theory of George C.  Williams's Adaptation and Natural Selection (1966).  Dawkins uses the term "selfish gene" as a way of expressing the gene-centred view of evolution as opposed to the views focused on the organism and the group, popularising ideas developed during the 1960s by W.  D.  Hamilton and others.  From the gene-centred view, it follows that the more two individuals are genetically related, the more sense (at the level of the genes) it makes for them to behave selflessly with each other. 

D. H. Lawrence<====>44191<====>D.  H.  Lawrence    David Herbert Lawrence (11 September 1885 – 2 March 1930) was an English novelist, poet, playwright, essayist, literary critic and painter.  His collected works represent, among other things, an extended reflection upon the dehumanising effects of modernity and industrialisation.  Some of the issues Lawrence explores are sexuality, emotional health, vitality, spontaneity, and instinct. Lawrence's opinions earned him many enemies and he endured official persecution, censorship, and misrepresentation of his creative work throughout the second half of his life, much of which he spent in a voluntary exile he called his "savage pilgrimage". 

DocBook<====>44193<====>DocBook  DocBook is a semantic markup language for technical documentation.  It was originally intended for writing technical documents related to computer hardware and software but it can be used for any other sort of documentation.  As a semantic language, DocBook enables its users to create document content in a presentation-neutral form that captures the logical structure of the content; that content can then be published in a variety of formats, including HTML, XHTML, EPUB, PDF, man pages, Web help DocBook WebHelp Project  and HTML Help, without requiring users to make any changes to the source.  In other words, when a document is written in DocBook format it becomes easily portable into other formats. 

Friends of the Earth<====>44195<====>Friends of the Earth  Friends of the Earth International (FoEI) is an international network of environmental organizations in 74 countries.  Friends of the Earth was founded in 1969 as an anti-nuclear group by Robert O Anderson    who contributed $200,000 in personal funds to launch FOTE with David Brower, Donald Aitken and Jerry Mander after Brower's split with the Sierra Club.  FOTE main mission was to lock up and prevent further development of nuclear energy.  Their first employee was Amory Lovins, who kicked off FOE in the UK.  It became an international network in 1971 with a meeting of representatives from the U. 

Document Style Semantics and Specification Language<====>44199<====>Document Style Semantics and Specification LanguageThe Document Style Semantics and Specification Language (DSSSL) is an international standard developed to provide a stylesheets for SGML documents.    DSSSL consists of two parts: a tree transformation process that can be used to manipulate the tree structure of documents prior to presentation, and a formatting process that associates the elements in the source document with specific nodes in the target representation—the flow object tree.  DSSSL specifications are device-independent pieces of information that can be interchanged between different platforms.  The back-end formatters needed to generate the final form of the document (e. 

Ezra Pound<====>44203<====>Ezra Pound  Ezra Weston Loomis Pound (30 October 1885 – 1 November 1972) was an expatriate American poet and critic, as well as a major figure in the early modernist movement.  His contribution to poetry began with his development of Imagism, a movement derived from classical Chinese and Japanese poetry, stressing clarity, precision and economy of language.  His works include Ripostes (1912), Hugh Selwyn Mauberley (1920) and the unfinished 120-section epic, The Cantos (1917–1969). Pound worked in London during the early 20th century as foreign editor of several American literary magazines, and helped discover and shape the work of contemporaries such as T.

The Life of Emile Zola<====>44210<====>The Life of Emile Zola The Life of Emile Zola is a 1937 American biographical film about French author Émile Zola, played by Paul Muni and directed by William Dieterle.   It has the distinction of being the second biographical film to win the Oscar for Best Picture.  It premiered at the Los Angeles Carthay Circle Theatre to great success both critically and financially.  Contemporary reviews cited it the best biographical film made up to that time.  In 2000, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". 

Shale<====>44211<====>Shale   Shale is a fine-grained, clastic sedimentary rock composed of mud that is a mix of flakes of clay minerals and tiny fragments (silt-sized particles) of other minerals, especially quartz and calcite.  Blatt, Harvey and Robert J.  Tracy (1996) Petrology: Igneous, Sedimentary and Metamorphic, 2nd ed. , Freeman, pp.  281–292Shale is characterized by breaks along thin laminae or parallel layering or bedding less than one centimeter in thickness, called fissility.   It is the most common sedimentary rock.  TextureShale typically exhibits varying degrees of fissility, breaking into thin layers, often splintery and usually parallel to the otherwise indistinguishable bedding plane because of the parallel orientation of clay mineral flakes. 

Theodore Dreiser<====>44213<====>Theodore Dreiser  Theodore Herman Albert Dreiser ( ;    August 27, 1871 – December 28, 1945) was an American novelist and journalist of the naturalist school.  His novels often featured main characters who succeeded at their objectives despite a lack of a firm moral code, and literary situations that more closely resemble studies of nature than tales of choice and agency.Dreiser's best known novels include Sister Carrie (1900) and An American Tragedy (1925).  In 1930 he was nominated to the Nobel Prize in Literature.    Early lifeDreiser was born in Terre Haute, Indiana to Sarah Maria (née Schanab) and John Paul Dreiser. 

Slate<====>44214<====>Slate   Slate is a fine-grained, foliated,  homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism.  It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock.  Essentials of Geology, 3rd Ed, Stephen Marshak  Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering, but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression.  The foliation in slate is called "slaty cleavage".   It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression.   When expertly "cut" by striking parallel to the foliation, with a specialized tool in the quarry, many slates will display a property called fissility, forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for roofing, floor tiles, and other purposes. 

Miniature effect<====>44216<====>Miniature effect  A miniature effect is a special effect created for motion pictures and television programs using scale models.  Scale models are often combined with high speed photography or matte shots to make gravitational and other effects appear convincing to the viewer.  The use of miniatures has largely been superseded by computer-generated imagery in the contemporary cinema. Where a miniature appears in the foreground of a shot, this is often very close to the camera lens — for example when matte painted backgrounds are used.  Since the exposure is set to the object being filmed so the actors appear well lit, the miniature must be over-lit in order to balance the exposure and eliminate any depth of field differences that would otherwise be visible. 

Menhaden<====>44217<====>Menhaden    Menhaden, also known as mossbunker and bunker, are forage fish of the genera Brevoortia and Ethmidium, two genera of marine fish in the family Clupeidae.  Menhaden is a blend of poghaden (pogy for short) and an Algonquian word akin to Narragansett munnawhatteaûg, derived from munnohquohteau ‘he fertilizes’, referring to their use of the fish as fertilizer.It is generally thought that Pilgrims were advised by Tisquantum (also known as Squanto) to plant menhaden with their crops.  DescriptionMenhaden are flat, have soft flesh, and a deeply forked tail.  They rarely exceed   in length, and have a varied weight range. 

San Francisco (1936 film)<====>44218<====>San Francisco (1936 film) San Francisco is a 1936 musical-drama directed by Woody Van Dyke, based on the April 18, 1906 San Francisco earthquake.  The film, which was the top-grossing movie of that year,  stars Clark Gable, Jeanette MacDonald, and Spencer Tracy.  The then very popular singing of MacDonald helped make this film a hit, coming on the heels of her other 1936 blockbuster, Rose Marie.  Famous silent film directors D.  W.  Griffith and Erich von Stroheim worked on the film without credit.  Griffith directed some of the mob scenes while von Stroheim contributed to the screenplay. 

Mel Gibson<====>44219<====>Mel GibsonMel Colmcille Gerard Gibson   (born January 3, 1956) is an American actor and filmmaker.  He is best known for his action hero roles, namely his breakout role as Max Rockatansky in the first three films in the Mad Max post-apocalyptic action series, and as Martin Riggs in the Lethal Weapon buddy cop film series. Gibson was born in Peekskill, New York.  He moved with his parents to Sydney, Australia, when he was 12 years old, and studied acting at the National Institute of Dramatic Art.  During the 1980s, he founded Icon Entertainment, a production company which independent film director Atom Egoyan has called "an alternative to the studio system".

Xerox Network Systems<====>44221<====>Xerox Network Systems Xerox Network Systems (XNS) is a computer networking protocol suite developed by Xerox within the Xerox Network Systems Architecture.  It provided general purpose network communications, internetwork routing and packet delivery, and higher level functions such as a reliable stream, and remote procedure calls.  XNS predated and influenced the development of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) networking model, and was very influential in local area networking designs during the 1980s.  It had little impact on TCP/IP, however, which was designed earlier. XNS was developed by the Xerox Systems Development Department in the early 1980s, who were charged with bringing Xerox Parc's research to market. 

Hungarian notation<====>44229<====>Hungarian notationHungarian notation is an identifier naming convention in computer programming, in which the name of a variable or function indicates its intention or kind, and in some dialects its type.  The original Hungarian Notation uses intention or kind in its naming convention and is sometimes called Apps Hungarian as it became popular in the Microsoft Apps division in the development of Word, Excel and other apps.  As the Microsoft Windows division adopted the naming convention, they used the actual data type for naming, and this convention became widely spread through the Windows API; this is sometimes called Systems Hungarian notation. 

Gelimer<====>44230<====>GelimerGelimer (original form possibly Geilamir,  480–553), King of the Vandals and Alans (530–534), was the last Germanic ruler of the North African Kingdom of the Vandals.  He became ruler in June 530 after deposing his first cousin, two generations removed, Hilderic, who had angered the Vandal nobility by converting to Catholic Christianity, as most of the Vandals at this time were fiercely devoted to Arian Christianity.  The Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I, who had supported Hilderic, soon declared war on the Vandals, ostensibly to restore Hilderic.  In June 533, Justinian sent an expeditionary force commanded by Belisarius which finally reached Africa in the beginning of September. 

Andrzej Żuławski<====>44232<====>Andrzej Żuławski  Andrzej Żuławski ( ; 22 November 1940 – 17 February 2016) was a Polish film director and writer.  He was born in Lwów, Poland (now Ukraine).  Culture. pl  Żuławski often went against mainstream commercialism in his films, and enjoyed success mostly with European art-house audiences. In the late 1950s, he studied cinema in France.  His second feature The Devil (1972) was banned in Poland, and Żuławski went to France.  After the success of That Most Important Thing: Love in 1975, he returned to Poland where he spent two years making On the Silver Globe (1988). 

Stage lighting<====>44234<====>Stage lighting  Stage lighting is the craft of lighting as it applies to the production of theatre, dance, opera and other performance arts.  [1], Stage Lighting Design Principle and Process   Several different types of stage lighting instruments are used in this discipline.  [2] theatrecrafts' Types of Lanterns.   In addition to basic lighting, modern stage lighting can also include special effects, such as lasers and fog machines.  People who work on stage lighting are commonly referred to as lighting technicians. The equipment used for stage lighting (e. g. , cabling, dimmers, lighting instruments, controllers) are also used in other lighting applications, including corporate events, concerts, trade shows, broadcast television, film production, photographic studios, and other types of live events.

Arthur Evans<====>44238<====>Arthur EvansSir Arthur John Evans FRS    FREng  ( ; 8 July 1851 – 11 July 1941) was an English archaeologist and pioneer in the study of Aegean civilization in the Bronze Age.  He is most famous for unearthing the palace of Knossos on the Greek island of Crete.  Evans continued Heinrich Schliemann's concept of a Mycenaean civilization, but found that he needed to distinguish another civilization, the Minoan, from the structures and artifacts found there and throughout the eastern Mediterranean.   Evans was also the first to define Cretan scripts Linear A and Linear B, as well as an earlier pictographic writing. 

Catherine I of Russia<====>44239<====>Catherine I of Russia Catherine I ( , born  , later known as Marta Samuilovna Skavronskaya;   –  ) was the second wife of Peter the Great and Empress of Russia from 1725 until her death. Life as a servantThe life of Catherine I was said by Voltaire to be nearly as extraordinary as that of Peter the Great himself.  There are no documents that confirm her origins.  Said to have been born on 15 April 1684 (o. s.  5 April),  she was originally named Marta Helena Skowrońska.  Marta was the daughter of Samuel Skowroński (later spelt Samuil Skavronsky), a Roman Catholic peasant from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth born to Minsker parents, who in 1680 married Dorothea Hahn at Jakobstadt.

She came to power following a coup d'état when her husband, Peter III, was assassinated.  Under her reign, Russia was revitalised; it grew larger and stronger, and was recognised as one of the great powers of Europe. In her accession to power and her rule of the empire, Catherine often relied on her noble favourites, most notably Grigory Orlov and Grigory Potemkin.

Although a headland, it was not formed by coastal erosion – as headlands are usually formed – but is a remnant of the orogenic processes that created the Apennines.  The entire coast of Lazio, on which the mountain and the marsh are located, was a chain of barrier islands that was formed on a horst and made part of the mainland by sedimentation of the intervening graben. Monte Circeo, as it is sometimes also called in Italian, is located on the southwest coast of Italy, about   south-southeast of Rome, near San Felice Circeo, on the coast between Anzio and Terracina. 

Ramayana<====>44245<====>Ramayana DISPLAYTITLE Ramayana ( ;   ,    ) is an ancient Indian epic poem which narrates the struggle of the divine prince Rama to rescue his wife Sita from the demon king Ravana.  Along with the Mahabharata, it forms the Sanskrit Itihasa. The epic, traditionally ascribed to the Hindu sage Valmiki, narrates the life of Rama, the legendary prince of the Kosala Kingdom.  It follows his fourteen-year exile to the forest from the kingdom, by his father King Dasharatha, on request of his second wife Kaikeyi.  His travels across forests in India with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana, the kidnapping of his wife by Ravana, the demon king of Lanka, resulting in a war with him, and Rama's eventual return to Ayodhya to be crowned king. 

North Ossetia-Alania<====>44247<====>North Ossetia-Alania The Republic of North Ossetia-Alania ( ;  , Respublikæ Cægat Iryston-Alani,    ) is a federal subject of Russia (a republic).  Its population according to the 2010 Census was 712,980.Its capital is the city of Vladikavkaz. NameIn the last years of the Soviet Union, as nationalist movements swept throughout the Caucasus, many intellectuals in the North Ossetian ASSR called for the revival of the name of Alania, a medieval kingdom of the Alans.  The term of "Alania" quickly became popular in Ossetian daily life through the names of various enterprises, a TV channel, political and civic organizations, publishing house, football team, etc. 

Dakar<====>44251<====>Dakar  {{Infobox settlement   }}Dakar ( ;    ) Dakar pronunciation: How to pronounce Dakar in French, Spanish, Polish   is the capital and largest city of Senegal.  It is located on the Cap-Vert peninsula on the Atlantic coast and is the westernmost city in the Old World as well as on the African mainland.  The city of Dakar proper has a population of 1,030,594, whereas the population of the Dakar metropolitan area is estimated at 2. 45 million.    The area around Dakar was settled in the 15th century.

Cape of Good Hope<====>44252<====>Cape of Good Hope   The Cape of Good Hope (   ,    ,) is a rocky headland on the Atlantic coast of the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. A common misconception is that the Cape of Good Hope is the southern tip of Africa.  This misconception was based on the misbelief that the Cape was the dividing point between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.  Contemporary geographic knowledge instead states the southernmost point of Africa is Cape Agulhas about   to the east-southeast.   The currents of the two oceans meet at the point where the warm-water Agulhas current meets the cold water Benguela current and turns back on itself.

Microsatellite<====>44259<====>Microsatellite A microsatellite is a tract of repetitive DNA in which certain DNA motifs (ranging in length from 1–6 or more base pairs) are repeated, typically 5–50 times.    Microsatellites occur at thousands of locations within an organism's genome.  They have a higher mutation rate than other areas of DNA  leading to high genetic diversity.  Microsatellites are often referred to as short tandem repeats (STRs) by forensic geneticists, or as simple sequence repeats (SSRs) by plant geneticists.  Microsatellites and their longer cousins, the minisatellites, together are classified as VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) DNA.

The former was named for the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, on the day of which the island was discovered; the latter was probably named for the ship sailed by the islands' discoverer, Gavriil Pribilof. 

Metafont<====>44263<====>Metafont Metafont is a description language used to define raster fonts.   It is also the name of the interpreter that executes Metafont code, generating the bitmap fonts that can be embedded into e. g.  PostScript.  Metafont was devised by Donald Knuth as a counterpart to his TeX typesetting system. One of the characteristics of Metafont is that all of the shapes of the glyphs are defined with geometrical equations.  In particular, one can define a given point to be the intersection of a line segment and a Bézier cubic. Mode of operationUnlike more common outline font formats (such as TrueType or PostScript Type 1), a Metafont font is primarily made up of strokes with finite-width "pens", along with filled regions.

A dual-premiership captain at North Melbourne, four-time North Melbourne best-and-fairest (Syd Barker Medallist) and seven-time All-Australian, Carey, is nicknamed "The King", or "Duck".  In 2001, he was named as centre half-forward and captain of North Melbourne's Team of the Century, and in 2008 was named as Australian football's greatest ever player, as part of a list of the top 50 players of all time, published in the book The Australian Game of Football, which was released by the League to celebrate 150 years of Australian rules football. 

Grand Union Canal<====>44268<====>Grand Union Canal    The Grand Union Canal in England is part of the British canal system.  Its main line starts in London and ends in Birmingham, stretching for   with 166 locks.   It has arms to places including Leicester, Slough, Aylesbury, Wendover and Northampton.  The Grand Union Canal was also the original name for part of what is now part of the Leicester Line of the modern Grand Union: this latter is now generally referred to as the Old Grand Union Canal to avoid ambiguity. HistoryWith competition from the railways having taken a large share of traffic in the second half of the 19th century, improvements in roads and vehicle technology in the early part of the 20th century meant that the lorry was also becoming a threat to the canals. 

United States Secretary of Commerce<====>44272<====>United States Secretary of Commerce The United States Secretary of Commerce (SecCom) is the head of the United States Department of Commerce.

Since the two departments split in 1913, the Department of Commerce is now headed by a separate U. 

Gun control<====>44276<====>Gun control   Gun control (or firearms regulation)   is the set of laws or policies that regulate the manufacture, sale, transfer, possession, modification, or use of firearms by civilians. Most countries have a restrictive firearm guiding policy, with only a few legislations being categorized as permissive.   Jurisdictions that regulate access to firearms typically restrict access to only certain categories of firearms and then to restrict the categories of persons who will be granted a firearms license to have access to a firearm. Terminology and context Gun control refers to domestic regulation of firearm manufacture, trade, possession, use, and transport, specifically with regard to the class of weapons referred to as small arms (revolvers and self-loading pistols, rifles and carbines, assault rifles, submachine guns and light machine guns).

Turning the other cheek<====>44282<====>Turning the other cheek Turning the other cheek, also known as offering one's cheek, is a phrase in Christian doctrine that refers to responding to injury without revenge.  Scriptural referencesThe phrase originates from the Sermon on the Mount in the New Testament.  In the Gospel of Matthew, an alternative for "an eye for an eye" is given by Jesus: In the Sermon on the Plain  in the Gospel of Luke, as part of his command to "love your enemies", Jesus says: This passage is variously interpreted as commanding nonresistance, Christian pacifism or nonviolence on the part of the victim. 

The Big Fisherman<====>44283<====>The Big Fisherman The Big Fisherman is a 1959 American film directed by Frank Borzage about the life of Simon Peter, one of the  disciples of Jesus.  Starring Howard Keel, Susan Kohner and John Saxon, the production is adapted from the 1948 novel by Lloyd C.  Douglas, which is closely related to Douglas' previous book, 1942's The Robe which, six years earlier, in 1953, had also been adapted for the screen under the same title, The Robe.  The film was shot at Universal-International studios but released by Buena Vista, the film releasing company of Walt Disney Productions. 

Noncoding DNA<====>44284<====>Noncoding DNAIn genomics and related disciplines, noncoding DNA sequences are components of an organism's DNA that do not encode protein sequences.  Some noncoding DNA is transcribed into functional non-coding RNA molecules (e. g.  transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and regulatory RNAs).  Other functions of noncoding DNA include the transcriptional and translational regulation of protein-coding sequences,  scaffold attachment regions, origins of DNA replication, centromeres and telomeres. The amount of noncoding DNA varies greatly among species.  Often, only a small percentage of the genome is responsible for coding proteins, but a rising percentage is being shown to have regulatory functions.

Something of a child prodigy, he graduated from high school and entered Westminster College in New Wilmington, Pennsylvania at the age of 14, but washed out at 17. Writing careerEdmond Hamilton's career as a science fiction writer began with the publication of "The Monster God of Mamurth", a short story, in the August 1926 issue of Weird Tales —now a classic magazine of alternative fiction. 

DNA profiling<====>44290<====>DNA profiling   DNA profiling (also called DNA fingerprinting, DNA testing, or DNA typing) is the process of determining an individual's DNA characteristics, called a DNA profile, that is very likely to be different in unrelated individuals, thereby being as unique to individuals as are fingerprints (hence the alternative name for the technique).  DNA profiling with the aim of identifying not an individual but a species is called DNA barcoding. DNA profiling is most commonly used as a forensic technique in criminal investigations to identify an unidentified person or whose identity needs to be confirmed, or to place a person at a crime scene or to eliminate a person from consideration.

Drumlin<====>44298<====>Drumlin A drumlin, from the Irish word droimnín ("littlest ridge"), first recorded in 1833, and in the classical sense is an elongated hill in the shape of an inverted spoon or half-buried egg  formed by glacial ice acting on underlying unconsolidated till or ground moraine. MorphologyDrumlins occur in various shapes and sizes,  including symmetrical (about the long axis), spindle, parabolic forms, together with transverse asymmetrical forms; their long axis is parallel to the direction of movement of the formative flow at the time of formation.  Drumlins are typically   long, less than   high and between   wide. 

Moraine<====>44299<====>Moraine A moraine is any glacially formed accumulation of unconsolidated glacial debris (regolith and rock) that occurs in both currently and formerly glaciated regions on Earth (i. e.  a past glacial maximum), through geomorphological processes.  Moraines are formed from debris previously carried along by a glacier and normally consist of somewhat rounded particles ranging in size from large boulders to minute glacial flour.  Lateral moraines are formed at the side of the ice flow and terminal moraines at the foot, marking the maximum advance of the glacier.  Other types of moraine include ground moraines, till-covered areas with irregular topography, and medial moraines which are formed where two glaciers meet. 

Amélie<====>44302<====>Amélie   Amélie (also known as Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain;  ;  ) is a 2001 French romantic comedy film directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet.

It tells the story of a shy waitress, played by Audrey Tautou, who decides to change the lives of those around her for the better, while struggling with her own isolation.  The film was a co-production between companies in France and Germany.  Taking in over $33 million in a limited theatrical release, it is to date the highest-grossing French-language film released in the United States, and one of the biggest international successes for a French movie. 

Leopard<====>44303<====>Leopard   The leopard (Panthera pardus)   is one of the five species in the genus Panthera, a member of the Felidae.   The leopard occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia and is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and are declining in large parts of the global range.  In Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuwait, Syria, Libya, Tunisia and most likely in Morocco,  leopard populations have already been extirpated.  Contemporary records suggest that the leopard occurs in only 25% of its historical global range. 

Hilderic<====>44304<====>Hilderic Hilderic (460s – 533) was the penultimate king of the Vandals and Alans in North Africa in Late Antiquity (523–530).  Although dead by the time the Vandal kingdom was overthrown in 534, he nevertheless played a key role in that event. Hilderic was the grandson of king Genseric, founder of the Vandal kingdom in Africa.  His father was Genseric's son Huneric, and his mother was Eudocia, the daughter of the Roman Emperor Valentinian III and Licinia Eudoxia.   Most of the Vandals were Arians and had persecuted Catholics, but Hilderic favored it as the religion of his mother, making his accession to the throne controversial. 

Pap test<====>44305<====>Pap test The Papanicolaou test (abbreviated as Pap test, known earlier as Pap smear, cervical smear, or smear test) is a method of cervical screening used to detect potentially pre-cancerous and cancerous processes in the cervix (opening of the uterus or womb).  Abnormal findings are often followed up by more sensitive diagnostic procedures, and, if warranted, interventions that aim to prevent progression to cervical cancer.  The test was invented by, and named for, the prominent Greek doctor Georgios Papanikolaou. A Pap smear is performed by opening the vaginal canal with a speculum, then collecting cells at the outer opening of the cervix at the transformation zone (where the outer squamous cervical cells meet the inner glandular endocervical cells).

A Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Snape is hostile to the series' protagonist, Harry, the moment he sets foot in Snape's classroom; this hostility is rooted in Harry's resemblance to Harry's father James, who bullied and harassed Snape during their time at Hogwarts.  Though philosophically attracted to the Dark Arts and Lord Voldemort's ideology of wizard supremacy, Snape's love for Muggle-born Lily Evans, Harry's mother, eventually compels him to defect from the Death Eaters. 

Club (organization)<====>44332<====>Club (organization)  A club is an association of two or more people united by a common interest or goal.  A service club, for example, exists for voluntary or charitable activities; there are clubs devoted to hobbies and sports, social activities clubs, political and religious clubs, and so forth. HistoryHistorically, clubs occurred in all ancient states of which we have detailed knowledge.  Once people started living together in larger groups, there was need for people with a common interest to be able to associate despite having no ties of kinship.  Organizations of the sort have existed for many years, as evidenced by Ancient Greek clubs and associations (collegia) in Ancient Rome.

He is Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University, and is known for his advocacy of evolutionary psychology and the computational theory of mind. Pinker's academic specializations are visual cognition and psycholinguistics.  His experimental subjects include mental imagery, shape recognition, visual attention, children's language development, regular and irregular phenomena in language, the neural bases of words and grammar, and the psychology of cooperation and communication, including euphemism, innuendo, emotional expression, and common knowledge. 

Henry Bessemer<====>44342<====>Henry Bessemer Sir Henry Bessemer (19 January 1813 – 15 March 1898) was an English inventor, whose steelmaking process would become the most important technique for making steel in the nineteenth century for almost one century from year 1856 to 1950.    He also played a significant role in establishing the town of Sheffield as a major industrial centre. Bessemer had been trying to reduce the cost of steelmaking for military ordnance, and developed his system for blowing air through molten pig iron to remove the impurities.  This made steel easier, quicker and cheaper to manufacture, and revolutionised structural engineering. 

Clover<====>44344<====>Clover  Clover or trefoil are common names for plants of the genus Trifolium (Latin, tres "three" + folium "leaf"), consisting of about 300 species of plants in the leguminous pea family Fabaceae.  A group of clovers is called a cluff.  The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution; the highest diversity is found in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics.  They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants.  Clover can be evergreen.  The leaves are trifoliate (rarely quatrefoiled (Four-leaf clover), cinquefoil, or septfoil), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. 

Damnatio memoriae<====>44345<====>Damnatio memoriae  Damnatio memoriae is a modern Latin phrase literally meaning "condemnation of memory", meaning that a person must not be remembered. It was a form of dishonor that could be passed by the Roman Senate on traitors or others who brought discredit to the Roman State.  The intent was to erase the malefactor from history. OverviewDamnatio Memoriae, or oblivion, as a punishment was originally created by the peoples of Ephesos after Herostratus set fire to the Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of antiquity.  The Romans, who viewed it as a punishment worse than death itself, adopted this practice. 

Shallot<====>44346<====>Shallot   The shallot is a type of onion, specifically a botanical variety of the species Allium cepa.  The shallot was formerly classified as a separate species, A.  ascalonicum, a name now considered a synonym of the currently accepted name.    Its close relatives include the garlic, leek, chive,    and Chinese onion.    NamesShallots probably originated in Central or Southwest Asia, travelling from there to India and the eastern Mediterranean.  The name "shallot" comes from Ashkelon, an ancient Canaanite city,  where people in classical Greek times believed shallots originated. 

The Phantom Edit<====>44348<====>The Phantom Edit DISPLAYTITLEStar Wars Episode I. I: The Phantom Edit is a fan edit of the film Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, removing many elements of the original film.  The purpose of the edit, according to creator Mike J.  Nichols, was to make a much stronger version of The Phantom Menace based on the previous execution and philosophies of film storytelling and editing of George Lucas.   The Phantom Edit was the first unauthorized re-edit of The Phantom Menace to receive major publicity and acclaim.  "The general consensus of fans on the Internet seems to be that the new edit is an improvement on the original version. 

Rudolf Hell<====>44351<====>Rudolf Hell Rudolf Hell (19 December 1901 – 11 March 2002)  was a German inventor.  He was born in Eggmühl, Germany. From 1919 to 1923 he studied electrical engineering in Munich.  He worked there from 1923 to 1929 as assistant of Prof.  Max Dieckmann, with whom he operated a television station at the Verkehrsausstellung (lit. : Traffic exhibition) in Munich in 1925.  In the same year Hell invented an apparatus called the Hellschreiber, an early forerunner to impact dot matrix printers and faxes.  Hell received a patent for the Hellschreiber in 1929. In the year 1929 he founded his own company in Babelsberg, Berlin. 

Selfish genetic element<====>44353<====>Selfish genetic elementSelfish genetics elements (also sometimes called selfish DNA) are genetic sequences that spread by forming additional copies of itself within the genome; and makes no specific contribution to the reproductive success of its host organism (it might or might not have significant deleterious effects). HistoryIn his 1976 book The Selfish Gene,    Richard Dawkins suggested the idea of selfish DNA in reaction to the then fairly new revelation of the large proportion of noncoding DNA in eukaryotic genomes.  In 1980, two articles in the journal Nature expanded and discussed the concept.   According to one of these articles: In the purest forms of the concepts, units of genetically functional DNA might be viewed as "replicating entities" that affect their replication by manipulating the physiological activities of the cell that they control; in contrast, units of selfish DNA affect their replication by exploiting existing DNA and DNA-manipulating mechanisms in the cell, notionally without significantly affecting the fitness of the organism in other respects. 

Carole Lombard<====>44354<====>Carole Lombard   Carole Lombard (born Jane Alice Peters, October 6, 1908 – January 16, 1942) was an American film actress.  She was particularly noted for her energetic, often off-beat roles in the screwball comedies of the 1930s.  She was the highest-paid star in Hollywood in the late 1930s.  She was the third wife of actor Clark Gable. Lombard was born into a wealthy family in Fort Wayne, Indiana, but was raised in Los Angeles by her single mother.  At 12, she was recruited by the film director Allan Dwan and made her screen debut in A Perfect Crime (1921).

Gary Cooper<====>44359<====>Gary Cooper   Gary Cooper (born Frank James Cooper; May 7, 1901 – May 13, 1961) was an American film actor known for his natural, authentic, and understated acting style and screen performances.  His career spanned thirty-five years, from 1925 to 1960, and included leading roles in eighty-four feature films.  He was a major movie star from the end of the silent film era through to the end of the golden age of Classical Hollywood.  His screen persona appealed strongly to both men and women, and his range of performances included roles in most major movie genres. 

Congo River<====>44361<====>Congo River  The Congo River (also known as the Zaire River;  ;  ;  ) is the second longest river in Africa after the Nile and the second largest river in the world by discharge volume of water (after the Amazon), and the world's deepest river with measured depths in excess of  .    The Congo-Chambeshi river has an overall length of  , which makes it the ninth-longest river (in terms of discharge, the Chambeshi is a tributary of the Lualaba River, Lualaba being the name of the Congo River upstream of the Boyoma Falls, extending for  1,800 km). 

Wien's displacement law<====>44363<====>Wien's displacement law Wien's displacement law states that the black body radiation curve for different temperatures peaks at a wavelength inversely proportional to the temperature.  The shift of that peak is a direct consequence of the Planck radiation law, which describes the spectral brightness of black body radiation as a function of wavelength at any given temperature.  However, it had been discovered by Wilhelm Wien several years before Max Planck developed that more general equation, and describes the entire shift of the spectrum of black body radiation toward shorter wavelengths as temperature increases. Formally, Wien's displacement law states that the spectral radiance of black body radiation per unit wavelength, peaks at the wavelength λ max  given by: \lambda_\text{max} = \frac{b}{T} where T is the absolute temperature in kelvins. 

Black body<====>44364<====>Black body A black body is an idealized physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence.   A white body is one with a "rough surface [that] reflects all incident rays completely and uniformly in all directions. " A black body in thermal equilibrium (that is, at a constant temperature) emits electromagnetic radiation called black-body radiation.  The radiation is emitted according to Planck's law, meaning that it has a spectrum that is determined by the temperature alone (see figure at right), not by the body's shape or composition. An ideal black body in thermal equilibrium has two notable properties: It is an ideal emitter: at every frequency, it emits as much or more thermal radiative energy as any other body at the same temperature. 

Typewriter<====>44365<====>Typewriter A typewriter is a mechanical or electromechanical machine for writing characters similar to those produced by printer's movable type.  Typically, a typewriter has an array of keys, each of which causes a different single character to be produced on the paper by causing an inked ribbon to be struck against the paper by a type element similar to the sorts used in movable type letterpress printing.  Commonly a separate type element (called a typebar) corresponds to each key, but the mechanism may also use a single type element (such as a typeball) with a different portion of it used for each possible character. 

Where the Heart Is (2000 film)<====>44366<====>Where the Heart Is (2000 film)  Where the Heart Is is a 2000 American romantic drama film directed by Matt Williams in his film directing debut.  The film stars Natalie Portman, Stockard Channing, Ashley Judd, and Joan Cusack with supporting roles performed by James Frain, Dylan Bruno, Keith David, and Sally Field.  The screenplay, written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, is based on the best-selling novel by Billie Letts.  The film follows five years in the life of Novalee Nation, a pregnant 17-year-old, who is abandoned by her boyfriend at a Walmart in a small Oklahoma town. 

Trefoil<====>44370<====>Trefoil  Trefoil (from Latin  , "three-leaved plant", French  , Italian  , German   and  , Dutch  , "clover", same as clubs) is a graphic form composed of the outline of three overlapping rings used in architecture and Christian symbolism.  The term is also applied to other symbols of three-fold shape. ArchitectureOrnamentationTrefoil is a term in Gothic architecture given to the ornamental foliation or cusping introduced in the heads of window-lights, tracery, panellings, etc. , in which the center takes the form of a three-lobed leaf (formed from three partially overlapping circles).   One of the earliest examples is in the plate tracery at Winchester (1222–1235). 

Triton (moon)<====>44371<====>Triton (moon)   Triton is the largest natural satellite of the planet Neptune, and the first Neptunian moon to be discovered.  It was discovered on October 10, 1846, by English astronomer William Lassell.  It is the only large moon in the Solar System with a retrograde orbit, an orbit in the opposite direction to its planet's rotation. At    in diameter, it is the seventh-largest moon in the Solar System.  Because of its retrograde orbit and composition similar to Pluto's, Triton is thought to have been a dwarf planet captured from the Kuiper belt. 

Sermon on the Mount<====>44372<====>Sermon on the Mount  The Sermon on the Mount (anglicized from the Matthean Vulgate Latin section title: Sermo in monte) is a collection of sayings and teachings of Jesus, which emphasizes his moral teaching found in the Gospel of Matthew (chapters 5, 6, and 7).  "Sermon on the Mount. " Cross, F.  L. , ed.  The Oxford dictionary of The Christian church.  New York: Oxford University Press.  2005   It is the first of the Five Discourses of Matthew and takes place relatively early in the Ministry of Jesus after he has been baptized by John the Baptist and preached in Galilee. 

Triton (mythology)<====>44373<====>Triton (mythology) Triton ( ;   Tritōn) is a mythological Greek god, the messenger of the sea.  He is the son of Poseidon and Amphitrite, god and goddess of the sea respectively, and is herald for his father.  He is usually represented as a merman which has the upper body of a human and the tail, soft dorsal fin, spiny dorsal fin, anal fin, pelvic fins and caudal fin of a fish, "sea-hued", according to Ovid  "his shoulders barnacled with sea-shells". Like his father, Poseidon, he carried a trident.  However, Triton's special attribute was a twisted conch shell, on which he blew like a trumpet to calm or raise the waves. 

Anna of Russia<====>44380<====>Anna of Russia   Anna Ioannovna ( ;   –  ), also spelled Anna Ivanovna  and sometimes anglicized as Anne,  was regent of the duchy of Courland from 1711 until 1730 and then ruled as Empress of Russia from 1730 to 1740. Early lifeAnna was born in Moscow as the daughter of Tsar Ivan V by his wife Praskovia Saltykova.  Ivan V was co-ruler of Russia along with his younger brother Peter the Great, but he was mentally disabled and incapable of administering the country, and Peter effectively ruled alone.  Ivan V died in February 1696, when Anna was only three years old, and her uncle became the sole ruler of Russia. 

Gunderic<====>44383<====>Gunderic  Gunderic ( ; 379–428), King of Hasding Vandals (407-418), then King of Vandals and Alans (418–428), led the Hasding Vandals, a Germanic tribe originally residing near the Oder River, to take part in the barbarian invasions of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century. HistoryHe was a son of King Godigisel, the Hasdingi's Vandal king when his people breached the Rhine river frontier of the Empire on the last day of 406.  During that year, the Vandals had become heavily involved in a war with the Franks, who were already settled as allies of the Romans, and who attempted to keep the Vandals out. 

Muggle<====>44385<====>Muggle   In the Harry Potter book series, a Muggle ( ) is a person who lacks any sort of magical ability and was not born in a magical family.  Muggles can also be described as people who do not have any magical blood inside them.  It differs from the term Squib, which refers to a person with one or more magical parents yet without any magical power/ability, and from the term Muggle-born (or the derogatory and offensive term mudblood, which is used to imply the supposed impurity of Muggle blood), which refers to a person with magical abilities but with non-magical parents. 

Socrates of Constantinople<====>44387<====>Socrates of ConstantinopleSocrates of Constantinople ( ,  b.  c.  380; d.  after 439), also known as Socrates Scholasticus, was a 5th-century Christian church historian, a contemporary of Sozomen and Theodoret. He is the author of a Historia Ecclesiastica ("Church History", Ἐκκλησιαστική Ἱστορία) which covers the history of late ancient Christianity during the years 305–439. LifeHe was born at Constantinople.  Even in ancient times nothing seems to have been known of his life except what can be gathered from notices in his Historia Ecclesiastica, which departed from its ostensible model, Eusebius of Caesarea, in emphasizing the place of the emperor in church affairs and in giving secular as well as church history. 

Andrzej Wajda<====>44392<====>Andrzej Wajda   Andrzej Witold Wajda ( ; 6 March 1926 – 9 October 2016) was a Polish film and theatre director.  Recipient of an Honorary Oscar,  the Palme d'Or,  as well as Honorary Golden Lion  and Golden Bear Awards, he was a prominent member of the "Polish Film School".  He was known especially for his trilogy of war films consisting of A Generation (1954), Kanał (1956) and Ashes and Diamonds (1958).    He is considered one of the world's most renowned filmmakers    whose works chronicled his native country's political and social evolution  and dealt with the myths of Polish national identity offering insightful analyses of the universal element of the Polish experience - the struggle to maintain dignity under the most trying circumstances. 

Claudius Gothicus<====>44393<====>Claudius Gothicus Claudius II ( ;  Jones, pg.  209  May 10, 210 – January 270), commonly known as Claudius Gothicus, was Roman emperor from 268 to 270.  During his reign he fought successfully against the Alemanni and scored a victory against the Goths at the Battle of Naissus.  He died after succumbing to "pestilence", possibly the Plague of Cyprian that had ravaged the provinces of the Empire. Early life and originClaudius' origin is Illyrian.  IllyriaSeveral of the most outstanding emperors of the late Roman Empire were of Illyrian origin, including Claudius II Gothicus,  Born on May 10, 210,  he was either from Sirmium in Pannonia Inferior or from Naissus Dardania (in Moesia Superior). 

Defenestrations of Prague<====>44397<====>Defenestrations of Prague  The Defenestrations of Prague ( ,  ,  ) were two incidents in the history of Bohemia in which multiple people were defenestrated (i. e. , thrown out a window).  The first occurred in 1419, and the second in 1618, although the term "Defenestration of Prague" more commonly refers to the second.  Each helped to trigger prolonged conflict, within Bohemia and beyond. First Defenestration of PragueThe First Defenestration of Prague involved the killing of seven members of the city council by a crowd of Czech Hussites on 30 July 1419.  Jan Želivský, a Hussite priest at the church of the Virgin Mary of the Snows, led his congregation on a procession through the streets of Prague to the New Town Hall (Novoměstská radnice) on Charles Square.

The founder of the Salian dynasty of emperors, Conrad also served as King of Germany from 1024, King of Italy from 1026, and King of Burgundy from 1033. The son of a mid-level nobleman in Franconia, Count Henry of Speyer and Adelaide of Alsace, he inherited the titles of count of Speyer and of Worms as an infant when his father died.  Conrad extended his power beyond his inherited lands, receiving the favor of the princes of the Kingdom of Germany. 

RV Triton<====>44400<====>RV Triton   }    The Research Vessel Triton is a trimaran vessel owned by Gardline Marine Sciences Limited and a former prototype British warship demonstrator for the UK's Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (later QinetiQ).  She was built as a technology demonstrator ship for the Royal Navy's Future Surface Combatant, and has been used to both prove the viability of the hull-form and as a trials platform for other QinetiQ innovations.The ship was used by the Australian Border Force's Marine Unit, and is currently (as of July 2017) moored in the River Fal near the King Harry chain ferry. 

Brown dwarf<====>44401<====>Brown dwarf Brown dwarfs are substellar objects that occupy the mass range between the heaviest gas giant planets and the lightest stars, of approximately 13 to 75–80 Jupiter masses ( ),   or approximately   to about  .  Below this range are the sub-brown dwarfs, and above it are the lightest red dwarfs (M9 V).  Brown dwarfs may be fully convective, with no layers or chemical differentiation by depth.  Unlike the stars in the main-sequence, brown dwarfs are not massive enough to sustain nuclear fusion of ordinary hydrogen ( 1 H) to helium in their cores. 

Shakers<====>44403<====>ShakersThe United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing, more commonly known as the Shakers, is a millenarian restorationist Christian sect founded in the 18th century in England.  They were initially known as "Shaking Quakers" because of their ecstatic behavior during worship services.  As early as 1747, women assumed leadership roles within the sect, notably Jane Wardley, Mother Ann Lee, and Mother Lucy Wright.  Shakers settled in colonial America, with initial settlements in New Lebanon, New York (called Mount Lebanon after 1861).  They practice a celibate and communal lifestyle, pacifism, and their model of equality of the sexes, which they institutionalized in their society in the 1780s. 

Zoroaster<====>44406<====>Zoroaster    Zoroaster (  or  , from Greek   Zōroastrēs), also known as Zarathustra ( ;   Zaraθuštra), Zarathushtra Spitama or Ashu Zarathushtra was an ancient Iranian-speaking  prophet whose teachings and innovations on the religious traditions of ancient Iranian-speaking peoples developed into the religion of Zoroastrianism, which by some accounts was the first world religion.He inaugurated a movement that eventually became the dominant religion in Ancient Persia.  He was a native speaker of Old Avestan and lived in the eastern part of the Iranian Plateau, but his exact birthplace is uncertain. 

Microphone array<====>44408<====>Microphone arrayA microphone array is any number of microphones operating in tandem.  There are many applications:Systems for extracting voice input from ambient noise (notably telephones, speech recognition systems, hearing aids)Surround sound and related technologiesBinaural recordingLocating objects by sound: acoustic source localization, e. g. , military use to locate the source(s) of artillery fire.  Aircraft location and tracking. High fidelity original recordingsEnvironmental Noise Monitoring Typically, an array is made up of omnidirectional microphones, directional microphones, or a mix of omnidirectional and directional microphones distributed about the perimeter of a space, linked to a computer that records and interprets the results into a coherent form. 

Conjunctivitis<====>44410<====>Conjunctivitis   Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, is inflammation of the outermost layer of the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelid.It makes the eye appear pink or reddish.   There may also be pain, burning, scratchiness, or itchiness.   The affected eye may have increased tears or be "stuck shut" in the morning.   Swelling of the white part of the eye may also occur.   Itching of the eye is more common in cases due to allergies.   Conjunctivitis can affect one or both eyes. 

Sedimentary rock<====>44412<====>Sedimentary rock Sedimentary rocks are types of rock that are formed by the deposition and subsequent cementation of that material at the Earth's surface and within bodies of water.  Sedimentation is the collective name for processes that cause mineral or organic particles (detritus) to settle in place.  The particles that form a sedimentary rock by accumulating are called sediment.  Before being deposited, the sediment was formed by weathering and erosion from the source area, and then transported to the place of deposition by water, wind, ice, mass movement or glaciers, which are called agents of denudation.  Sedimentation may also occur as minerals precipitate from water solution or shells of aquatic creatures settle out of suspension. 

Senate<====>44417<====>Senate   A senate is a deliberative assembly, often the upper house or chamber of a bicameral legislature or parliament.  The name comes from the ancient Roman Senate (Latin: Senatus), so-called as an assembly of the senior (Latin: senex meaning "the elder" or "old man") and therefore allegedly wiser and more experienced members of the society or ruling class.  Thus, the literal meaning of the word "senate" is Assembly of Elders. Many countries have an assembly named a senate, composed of senators who may be elected, appointed, have inherited the title, or gained membership by other methods, depending on the country. 

Deliberative assembly<====>44418<====>Deliberative assemblyA Deliberative assembly is a gathering of members (of any kind of collective) who use parliamentary procedure to make decisions. History of termIn a speech to the electorate at Bristol in 1774, Edmund Burke described the British Parliament as a "deliberative assembly," and the expression became the basic term for a body of persons meeting to discuss and determine common action.   CharacteristicsRobert's Rules of Order Newly Revised describes the following characteristics of a deliberative assembly: A group of people meets to discuss and make decisions on behalf of the entire membership. They meet in a single room or area or under equivalent conditions of simultaneous aural communication. 

Robert's Rules of Order<====>44419<====>Robert's Rules of Order  Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised, commonly referred to as Robert’s Rules of Order (or simply Robert’s Rules),  is the most widely used manual of parliamentary procedure in the United States.It governs the meetings of a diverse range of organizations—including church groups, county commissions, homeowners associations, nonprofit associations, professional societies, school boards, and trade unions—that have adopted it as their parliamentary authority.  The manual was first published in 1876 by U. S.  Army officer Henry Martyn Robert, who adapted the rules and practice of Congress to the needs of non-legislative societies. 

Legislature<====>44421<====>Legislature  A legislature is a deliberative assembly with the authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country or city.  Legislatures form important parts of most governments; in the separation of powers model, they are often contrasted with the executive and judicial branches of government. Laws enacted by legislatures are known as legislation.  Legislatures observe and steer governing actions and usually have exclusive authority to amend the budget or budgets involved in the process.  The members of a legislature are called legislators.  In a democracy, legislators are most commonly popularly elected, although indirect election and appointment by the executive are also used, particularly for bicameral legislatures featuring an upper chamber. 

Adjara<====>44422<====>Adjara  Adjara (   ), officially known as the Autonomous Republic of Adjara (Georgian: აჭარის ავტონომიური რესპუბლიკა  ), is a historical, geographic and political-administrative region of Georgia.  Located in the country's southwestern corner, Adjara lies on the coast of the Black Sea near the foot of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, north of Turkey.  It is an important tourism destination and includes Georgia's second-largest city of Batumi as its capital.  About 350,000 people live on its 2,880 km 2 .  Adjara is home to the Adjarians, a regional subgroup of Georgians.  Adjara's name can be spelled in a number of ways, including Ajara, Ajaria, Adjaria, Adzharia, Atchara and Achara, among others. 

Metamorphic rock<====>44424<====>Metamorphic rockMetamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types, in a process called metamorphism, which means "change in form".   The original rock (protolith) is subjected to heat (temperatures greater than 150 to 200 °C) and pressure  ,  causing profound physical or chemical change.  The protolith may be a sedimentary, igneous, or existing metamorphic rock. Metamorphic rocks make up a large part of the Earth's crust and form 12% of the Earth's land surface.They are classified by texture and by chemical and mineral assemblage (metamorphic facies). 

National Security Act of 1947<====>44426<====>National Security Act of 1947 The National Security Act of 1947 was a major restructuring of the United States government's military and intelligence agencies following World War II.  The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the Senate confirmed James Forrestal as the first Secretary of Defense.    The Act merged the Department of War (renamed as the Department of the Army) and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (NME), headed by the Secretary of Defense.  It also created the Department of the Air Force and the United States Air Force, which separated the Army Air Forces into its own service. 

Chondrus crispus<====>44428<====>Chondrus crispus Chondrus crispus—commonly called Irish moss or carrageen moss (Irish carraigín, "little rock")—is a species of red algae  which grows abundantly along the rocky parts of the Atlantic coast of Europe and North America.  In its fresh condition this protist is soft and cartilaginous, varying in color from a greenish-yellow, through red, to a dark purple or purplish-brown.  The principal constituent is a mucilaginous body, made of the polysaccharide carrageenan, which constitutes 55% of its weight.  The organism also consists of nearly 10% protein and about 15% mineral matter, and is rich in iodine and sulfur. 

Glacis<====>44430<====>Glacis A glacis ( ;  ) in military engineering is an artificial slope as part of a medieval castle or in early modern fortresses.  They may be constructed of earth as a temporary structure or of stone in more permanent structure. A glacis plate is the sloped front-most section of the hull of a tank or other armoured fighting vehicle. More generally, a glacis is any slope, natural or artificial, which fulfils the above requirements.  The etymology of this French word suggests a slope made dangerous with ice, hence the relationship with glacier. Ancient fortificationsA glacis could also appear in ancient fortresses, such as the one the ancient Egyptians built at Semna in Nubia.

When the Danish company went bankrupt in 1755, the King of Denmark-Norway assumed direct control of the three islands.  Britain occupied the Danish West Indies in 1801–1802 and 1807–1815, during the Napoleonic Wars. 

Tractor beam<====>44434<====>Tractor beamA tractor beam is a device with the ability to attract one object to another from a distance.   The concept originates in fiction: the term was coined by E.  E.  Smith (an update of his earlier "attractor beam") in his novel Spacehounds of IPC (1931).   Since the 1990s, technology and research has laboured to make it a reality, and have had some success on a microscopic level.   Another method to realize tractor beams is based on the use of biaxial birefringent media.Less commonly, a similar beam that repels is called a pressor beam or repulsor beam.

Condorcet method<====>44446<====>Condorcet method   A Condorcet method ( ) is an election method that elects the candidate that would win a majority of the vote in all of the head-to-head elections against each of the other candidates, whenever there is such a candidate.  A candidate with this property is called the Condorcet winner.  Voting methods that always elect the Condorcet winner, when one exists, satisfy the Condorcet criterion. A Condorcet winner does not always exist in every election because the preference of a group of voters selecting from more than two options can be cyclic—that is, for each candidate it might be possible to select an opponent where the opponent would win a majority of the votes.

Saturn<====>44474<====>Saturn Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter.  It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth.   It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but with its larger volume Saturn is over 95 times more massive.    Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's sickle. Saturn's interior is probably composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). 

Uranus<====>44475<====>Uranus  Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun.  It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.  Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have different bulk chemical composition from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn.  For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the gas giants.  Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.

Respirometer<====>44479<====>RespirometerA respirometer is a device used to measure the rate of respiration of a living organism by measuring its rate of exchange of oxygen and/or carbon dioxide.  They allow investigation into how factors such as age, or chemicals affect the rate of respiration.  Respirometers are designed to measure respiration either on the level of a whole animal or plant or on the cellular level.  These fields are covered by whole animal and cellular (or mitochondrial) respirometry, respectively. A simple whole plant respirometer designed to measure oxygen uptake or CO 2  release consists of a sealed container with the living specimen together with a substance to absorb the carbon dioxide given off during respiration, such as soda lime pellets or cotton wads soaked with potassium hydroxide. 

Tuff<====>44481<====>Tuff  Tuff (from the Italian tufo) is a type of rock made of volcanic ash ejected from a vent during a volcanic eruption.  Following ejection and deposition, the ash is compacted into a solid rock in a process called consolidation.   Tuff is sometimes erroneously called "tufa", particularly when used as construction material; although tufa is a limestone precipitated from groundwater.   Rock that contains greater than 50% tuff is considered tuffaceous.   Tuff is a relatively soft rock, so it has been used for construction since ancient times.  Since it is common in Italy the Romans used it often for construction.

The terms Fortean and Forteana are sometimes used to characterize various such phenomena.  Fort's books sold well and are still in print.   His work continues to inspire admirers, who refer to themselves as "Forteans", and has influenced some aspects of science fiction. BiographyFort's collections of scientific anomalies including The Book of the Damned (1919) influenced numerous science fiction writers with their iconoclastic skepticism and as sources of ideas.  "Fortean" phenomena are events which seem to challenge the boundaries of accepted scientific knowledge, and the Fortean Times (founded as The News in 1973, and renamed in 1976) investigates such phenomena.

Linear motor<====>44495<====>Linear motorA linear motor is an electric motor that has had its stator and rotor "unrolled" so that instead of producing a torque (rotation) it produces a linear force along its length.  However, linear motors are not necessarily straight.  Characteristically, a linear motor's active section has ends, whereas more conventional motors are arranged as a continuous loop. The most common mode of operation is as a Lorentz-type actuator, in which the applied force is linearly proportional to the current and the magnetic field  (\vec F = I \vec L \times \vec B) . Many designs have been put forward for linear motors, falling into two major categories, low-acceleration and high-acceleration linear motors.

Located close to South Africa's border with Botswana, Mahikeng is   northeast of Cape Town and   west of Johannesburg.  In 2001, it had a population of 49,300.  In 2007, Mafikeng was reported to have a population of 250,000 of which the CBD constitutes between 69,000 and 75,000. 

Acadians<====>44515<====>Acadians   The Acadians ( ,  ) are the descendants of French colonists who settled in Acadia during the 17th and 18th centuries, some of whom are also descended from the Indigenous peoples of the region.    The colony was located in what is now Eastern Canada's Maritime provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island), as well as part of Quebec, and present-day Maine to the Kennebec River.  Although today most of the Acadians and Québécois are French-speaking (francophone) Canadians, Acadia was a distinctly separate colony of New France.  It was geographically and administratively separate from the French colony of Canada (modern-day Quebec). 

François Boucher<====>44517<====>François Boucher  François Boucher ( ; 29 September 1703 – 30 May 1770) was a French painter, draughtsman and etcher, who worked in the Rococo style.  Boucher is known for his idyllic and voluptuous paintings on classical themes, decorative allegories, and pastoral scenes.  He was perhaps the most celebrated painter and decorative artist of the 18th century.  He also painted several portraits of his patroness, Madame de Pompadour. LifeA native of Paris, Boucher was the son of a lesser known painter Nicolas Boucher, who gave him his first artistic training.  At the age of seventeen, a painting by Boucher was admired by the painter François Lemoyne.

He is primarily known as a sculptor, but also produced paintings and lithographs. Early years and careerZadkine was born on 4 July 1890 as Yossel Aronovich Tsadkin ( ) in the city of Vitsebsk, part of the Russian Empire (now Belarus).He was born to a Jewish father and a mother named Zippa-Dvoyra, who he claimed to be of Scottish origin.   Ossip had 5 siblings: sisters Mira, Roza and Fania and brothers Mark and Moses. 

List of National Parks of Canada<====>44519<====>List of National Parks of Canada  This is a  list of National Parks of Canada.  Canadian National Parks preserve both spectacular and representative areas of the country, located in every one of the nation's 13 provinces and territories.  The goal of the national park service is to create a system of protected areas which represent all the distinct natural regions of the country.   Parks Canada the governing and administration body for the system has developed a plan identifying 39 different regions it aims to represent.  In 2005, Parks Canada reported that the system was more than 60% complete. 

Mutiny on the Bounty (novel)<====>44524<====>Mutiny on the Bounty (novel)  Mutiny on the Bounty is the title of the 1932 novel by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall, based on the mutiny against Lieutenant William Bligh, commanding officer of the Bounty in 1789.  It has been made into several films and a musical.  It was the first of what became The Bounty Trilogy, which continues with Men Against the Sea, and concludes with Pitcairn's Island. Plot introductionThe novel tells the story through a fictional first-person narrator by the name of Roger Byam, based on a crew member Peter Heywood.   Byam, although not one of the mutineers, remains with the Bounty after the mutiny. 

Raphael<====>44525<====>Raphael   Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino  ( ; March 28 or April 6, 1483 April 6, 1520),  known as Raphael ( ,  ), was an Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance.  His work is admired for its clarity of form, ease of composition, and visual achievement of the Neoplatonic ideal of human grandeur.  Together with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, he forms the traditional trinity of great masters of that period.  Raphael was enormously productive, running an unusually large workshop and, despite his death at 37, leaving a large body of work. 

Notes on Muscovite Affairs<====>44526<====>Notes on Muscovite Affairs Notes on Muscovite Affairs (Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii) (1549) was a Latin book by Baron Sigismund von Herberstein on the geography, history and customs of Muscovy (the 16th century Russian state).  The book was the main early source of knowledge about Russia in Western Europe. BackgroundHerberstein was an Austrian diplomat who was twice sent to Russia as Austrian ambassador, in 1517 and 1526.  Born in Vipava (German Wippach), Slovenia, he was familiar with Slovene, a Slavic language, which became important later on his mission in Russia, when he was able to communicate with ordinary Russians in Slovene, another Slavic language. 

History of Portugal<====>44531<====>History of Portugal  The History of Portugal can be traced from circa 400,000 years ago, when the region of present-day Portugal was inhabited by Homo heidelbergensis.  The oldest human fossil is the skull discovered in the Cave of Aroeira in Almonda.  Later Neanderthals roamed the northern Iberian peninsula.  Homo sapiens sapiens arrived in Portugal around 35,000 years ago.  Pre-Celtic tribes such as the Cynetes lived in the Algarve and Lower Alentejo regions before the 6th century BCE, developed the city of Tartessos and the written Tartessian language, and left many stelae in the south of the country. 

Li Peng<====>44533<====>Li PengLi Peng ( ; born 20 October 1928) is a retired Chinese politician.  Li served as the fourth Premier of the People's Republic of China, between 1987 and 1998, and the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's top legislative body, from 1998 to 2003.  For much of the 1990s Li was ranked second in the Communist Party of China (CPC) hierarchy behind then Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin.  He retained his seat on the CPC Politburo Standing Committee until 2002. Li was the son of an early Communist revolutionary, but was orphaned as a child when his father was executed by the Kuomintang. 

Tiananmen Square protests of 1989<====>44534<====>Tiananmen Square protests of 1989   The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, commonly known in mainland China as the June Fourth Incident ( ), were student-led demonstrations in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, in 1989.  More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement ( ).  The protests were forcibly suppressed after the government declared martial law.  In what became known in the West as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with automatic rifles and tanks killed at least several hundred demonstrators trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square. 

The Kids in the Hall<====>44538<====>The Kids in the Hall    The Kids in the Hall is a Canadian sketch comedy troupe formed in 1984, consisting of comedians Dave Foley, Kevin McDonald, Bruce McCulloch, Mark McKinney, and Scott Thompson.  Their eponymous television show ran from 1989 to 1995 on CBC in Canada, and CBS, HBO, and Comedy Central in the United States.  The theme song for the show is the instrumental "Having an Average Weekend" by the Canadian band Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet. The Kids made one film, Brain Candy, which was released in 1996.   They reformed for various tours and comedy festivals in 2000. 

Phoolan Devi<====>44541<====>Phoolan Devi  Phoolan Devi (10 August 1963 – 25 July 2001), popularly known as "Bandit queen", was an Indian bandit and later a Member of Parliament. Born into a low caste family in rural Uttar Pradesh, Phoolan endured poverty as a child and had an unsuccessful marriage before taking to a life of crime.  Having developed major differences with her parents and her husband alike, the teenage Phoolan sought escape by running away and joining a gang of bandits.  She was the only woman in that gang, and her relationship with one gang member, coupled with other minor factors, caused a gunfight between gang members. 

Pat Mastelotto<====>44542<====>Pat Mastelotto   Pat Mastelotto (born Lee Patrick Mastelotto; September 10, 1955) is an American rock drummer and record producer who has worked most notably with Mr.  Mister and King Crimson, among many others (XTC, the Rembrandts).    For King Crimson, he initially formed part of the "double trio" lineup of 1994, joining Bill Bruford on drums. CareerMastelotto was born in Chico, California.   He started playing the drums at the age of 10; by the time he was 16 he was playing in popular local bands and while still in high school commuted several hours to Lake Tahoe for gigs.

Blair, and former Tubes and Grateful Dead keyboardist Vince Welnick. 

Till<====>44545<====>Till   Till or glacial till  is unsorted glacial sediment. Till is derived from the erosion and entrainment of material by the moving ice of a glacier.  It is deposited some distance down-ice to form terminal, lateral, medial and ground moraines. Till is classified into primary deposits, laid down directly by glaciers, and secondary deposits, reworked by fluvial transport and other processes. ProcessesGlacial drift is the coarsely graded and extremely heterogeneous sediment of a glacier; till is the part of glacial drift deposited directly by the glacier.  Its content may vary from clays to mixtures of clay, sand, gravel, and boulders. 

Tie rod<====>44547<====>Tie rodA tie rod is a slender structural unit used as a tie and (in most applications) capable of carrying tensile loads only. Subtypes and examples of applicationsIn airplane structures, tie rods are sometimes used in the fuselage or wings. Tie rods are often used in steel structures, such as bridges, industrial buildings, tanks, towers, and cranes. Sometimes tie rods are retrofitted to bowing or subsiding masonry walls (brick, block, stone, etc. ) to keep them from succumbing to lateral forces. The rebar used in reinforced concrete is not referred to as a "tie rod", but it essentially performs some of the same tension-force-counteracting purposes that tie rods perform.

Bloemfontein<====>44552<====>Bloemfontein   Bloemfontein ( ;    ; Afrikaans and Dutch previously "fountain of flowers" or "blooming fountain;" also known as Bloem) is the capital city of the province of Free State of South Africa; and, as the judicial capital of the nation, one of South Africa's three national capitals (the other two being Cape Town, the legislative capital, and Pretoria, the administrative capital) and is the seventh largest city in South Africa.Situated at an altitude of   above sea level, the city is home to approximately 520,000  residents and forms part of the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality which has a population of 747,431. 

Cape Colony<====>44554<====>Cape Colony The Cape of Good Hope, also known as the Cape Colony ( ), was a British colony in present-day South Africa, named after the Cape of Good Hope.   The British colony was preceded by an earlier Dutch colony of the same name, the Kaap de Goede Hoop, established in 1652 by the Dutch East India Company.  The Cape was under Dutch rule from 1652 to 1795 and again from 1803 to 1806.   The Dutch lost the colony to Great Britain following the 1795 Battle of Muizenberg, but had it returned following the 1802 Peace of Amiens. 

Union of South Africa<====>44555<====>Union of South Africa    The Union of South Africa ( ,  ) is the historic predecessor to the present-day republic of South Africa.   It came into being on 31 May 1910 with the unification of four previously separate British colonies: the Cape, Natal, Transvaal and Orange River colonies.   It included the territories formerly part of the Boer republics annexed in 1902, the South African Republic and the Orange Free State. Following the First World War, the Union of South Africa was granted the administration of South West Africa (formerly a German colony and today the sovereign state of Namibia) as a League of Nations mandate, which became treated in most respects as if it were another province of the Union, but never was formally annexed. 

Cape Province<====>44557<====>Cape Province  The Province of the Cape of Good Hope  ( ), commonly referred to as the Cape Province ( ), was a province in the Union of South Africa and subsequently the Republic of South Africa.  It encompassed the old Cape Colony, and had Cape Town as its capital.  Following the end of the Apartheid era, the Cape Province was split up to form the new Eastern Cape, Northern Cape and Western Cape provinces. HistoryWhen the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, the original Cape Colony was renamed the Cape Province. It was by far the largest of South Africa's four provinces, as it contained regions it had previously annexed, such as British Bechuanaland (not to be confused with the Bechuanaland Protectorate, now Botswana), Griqualand East (the area around Kokstad) and Griqualand West (area around Kimberley). 

ISO/IEC 8859-15<====>44561<====>ISO/IEC 8859-15 ISO/IEC 8859-15:1999, Information technology — 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets — Part 15: Latin alphabet No.  9, is part of the ISO/IEC 8859 series of ASCII-based standard character encodings, first edition published in 1999.  It is informally referred to as Latin-9 (and was for a while called Latin-0).  It is similar to ISO 8859-1, and thus generally intended for “Western European” languages, but replaces some less common symbols with the euro sign and some letters that were now deemed missing in part 1 for the target use: Position  0xA4 0xA6 0xA8 0xB4 0xB8 0xBC 0xBD 0xBE 8859-1 ¤ ¦ ¨ ´ ¸ ¼ ½ ¾ 8859-15 € Š š Ž ž Œ œ Ÿ ISO-8859-15 is the IANA preferred charset name for this standard when supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429. 

Graphics suite<====>44563<====>Graphics suite A graphics suite is a software suite for graphics work that are distributed together. The programs are usually able to interact with each other on a higher level than the operating system would normally allow  .There is no hard, fast rule regarding the programs to be included in a graphics application suite, but most will include at least a bitmap graphics editor and a vector graphics editor. In addition to these, the suite may contain VRML editors, animation editors, and morphing tools.See alsoAdobe graphics suiteCorelDRAW Graphics SuiteMicrosoft Expression StudioDEFAULTSORT 

Raster graphics editor<====>44564<====>Raster graphics editor  A raster graphics editor is a computer program that allows users to create and edit images  interactively on the computer screen and save them in one of many "bitmap" or "raster" formats such as JPEG, PNG, GIF and TIFF. An image viewer program is usually preferred over a raster graphics editor for viewing images. Comparison to vector graphic editorsVector graphics editors are often contrasted with raster graphics editors, yet their capabilities complement each other.  The technical difference between vector and raster editors stem from the difference between vector and raster images.  Vector graphics are created mathematically, using geometric formulas. 

Vector graphics editor<====>44565<====>Vector graphics editor A vector graphics editor is a computer program that allows users to compose and edit vector graphics images interactively on a computer and save them in one of many popular vector graphics formats, such as EPS, PDF, WMF, SVG, or VML. Vector editors versus bitmap editorsVector editors are often contrasted with bitmap editors, and their capabilities complement each other.  Vector editors are often better for page layout, typography, logos, sharp-edged artistic illustrations (e. g.  cartoons, clip art, complex geometric patterns), technical illustrations, diagramming and flowcharting.  Bitmap editors are more suitable for retouching, photo processing, photorealistic illustrations, collage, and illustrations drawn by hand with a pen tablet. 

Herbivore<====>44568<====>Herbivore   A herbivore is an animal anatomically and physiologically adapted to eating plant material, for example foliage, for the main component of its diet.  As a result of their plant diet, herbivorous animals typically have mouthparts adapted to rasping or grinding.  Horses and other herbivores have wide flat teeth that are adapted to grinding grass, tree bark, and other tough plant material. A large percentage of herbivores have mutualistic gut flora that help them digest plant matter, which is more difficult to digest than animal prey.This flora is made up of cellulose-digesting protozoans or bacteria. 

Helen Hunt<====>44569<====>Helen Hunt  Helen Elizabeth Hunt (born June 15, 1963) is an American actress, director, and screenwriter.  She starred in the sitcom Mad About You for seven years, and played single mother Carol Connelly in the 1997 romantic comedy film As Good as It Gets, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress.  Some of her other notable films include Twister (1996), Cast Away (2000), What Women Want (2000), Pay It Forward (2000), and The Sessions (2012).  Hunt's performance in The Sessions garnered her a second Academy Award nomination.  She made her directorial debut in 2007 with Then She Found Me (2007).

Weight training<====>44574<====>Weight training   Weight training is a common type of  strength training for developing the strength and size of skeletal muscles.  It utilizes the force of gravity in the form of weighted bars, dumbbells or weight stacks in order to oppose the force generated by muscle through concentric or eccentric contraction.  Weight training uses a variety of specialized equipment to target specific muscle groups and types of movement. Sports where strength training is central are bodybuilding, weightlifting, powerlifting, and strongman, highland games, shot put, discus throw, and javelin throw.  Many other sports use strength training as part of their training regimen, notably: American football, baseball, basketball, football, hockey, lacrosse, mixed martial arts, rowing, rugby league, rugby union, track and field, and wrestling. 

Russo-Japanese War<====>44575<====>Russo-Japanese War    The Russo–Japanese War ( , Russko-yaponskaya voina;   Nichirosensō; 1904–05) was fought between the Russian Empire and the Empire of Japan over rival imperial ambitions in Manchuria and Korea.  The major theatres of operations were the Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden in Southern Manchuria and the seas around Korea, Japan and the Yellow Sea. Russia sought a warm-water port on the Pacific Ocean for its navy and for maritime trade.  Vladivostok was operational only during the summer, whereas Port Arthur, a naval base in Liaodong Province leased to Russia by China, was operational all year. 

Big O notation<====>44578<====>Big O notation Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.   It is a member of a family of notations invented by Paul Bachmann,  Edmund Landau,  and others, collectively called Bachmann–Landau notation or asymptotic notation. In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows. In analytic number theory, big O notation is often used to express a bound on the difference between an arithmetical function and a better understood approximation; a famous example of such a difference is the remainder term in the prime number theorem. 

Monostable<====>44580<====>MonostableA monostable multivibrator is an electronic circuit that generates an output pulse.  When triggered, a pulse of pre-defined duration is produced.  The circuit then returns to its stable state and produces no more output until triggered again. Monostables may be considered as a biased form of multivibrator where it is stable in one state until triggered, then unstable and will return spontaneously. If repeated application of the input pulse maintains the circuit in the unstable state, it is called a retriggerable monostable.  If further trigger pulses do not affect the period, the circuit is a non-retriggerable monostable. 

John of the Cross<====>44582<====>John of the Cross  John of the Cross ( ; 1542  – 14 December 1591) was a major figure of the Counter-Reformation, a Spanish mystic, a Roman Catholic saint, a Carmelite friar and a priest, who was born at Fontiveros, Old Castile. John of the Cross is known for his writings.  Both his poetry and his studies on the growth of the soul are considered the summit of mystical Spanish literature and one of the peaks of all Spanish literature.  He was canonized as a saint in 1726 by Pope Benedict XIII.  He is one of the thirty-six Doctors of the Church. 

Robert of Ketton<====>44584<====>Robert of KettonRobert of Ketton, known in Latin as Rodbertus Ketenensis (  1141–1157), was an English astronomer, translator, priest and diplomat active in Spain.  He translated several works of Arabic into Latin, including the first translation of the Quran into any language.  Between 1144 and 1157 he held an archdeaconry in the diocese of Pamplona.  In the past he has been confounded with Robert of Chester (Latin Robertus Castrensis), another English translator active in Spain in the mid-twelfth century; and at least one modern scholar believes they are the same person.  Charles Burnett, "Ketton, Robert of (fl. 

Cyclotron<====>44585<====>Cyclotron A cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator invented by Ernest O.  Lawrence   Lawrence, Ernest O.  Method and apparatus for the acceleration of ions, filed: January 26, 1932, granted: February 20, 1934in 1934 in which charged particles accelerate outwards from the centre along a spiral path.   The particles are held to a spiral trajectory by a static magnetic field and accelerated by a rapidly varying (radio frequency) electric field.  Lawrence was awarded the 1939 Nobel prize in physics for this invention.   Cyclotrons were the most powerful particle accelerator technology until the 1950s when they were superseded by the synchrotron, and are still used to produce particle beams in physics and nuclear medicine. 

Radius of gyration<====>44590<====>Radius of gyrationRadius of gyration or gyradius of a body about an axis of rotation is defined as the radial distance of a point from the axis of rotation at which, if whole mass of the body is assumed to be concentrated, its moment of inertia about the given axis would be the same as with its actual distribution of mass.  It is denoted by "k"Mathematically the radius of gyration is the root mean square distance of the object's parts from either its center of mass or a given axis, depending on the relevant application.  It is actually the perpendicular distance from point mass to the axis of rotation. 

Portland, Maine<====>44591<====>Portland, Maine    Portland is the most populous city in the U. S.  state of Maine, with a population of 66,937 as of 2016.   This makes it the fourth least populous city in the U. S.  to be the most populous in its state.  The Greater Portland metropolitan area is home to over half a million people, more than one-third of Maine's total population.  The Old Port district is frequented by tourists, while Portland Head Light is also a destination.  The city seal depicts a phoenix rising from ashes, which is a reference to the recoveries from four devastating fires. 

National parks of England and Wales<====>44592<====>National parks of England and Wales The national parks of England and Wales are areas of relatively undeveloped and scenic landscape that are designated under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act (2016).  Despite their similar name, national parks in England and Wales are quite different from national parks in many other countries, which are usually owned and managed by the government as a protected community resource, and which do not usually include permanent human communities.  In England and Wales, designation as a national park may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and land within a national park remains largely in private ownership. 

Rib<====>44593<====>Rib   In vertebrate anatomy, ribs ( ) are the long curved bones which form the rib cage.  In most tetrapods, ribs surround the chest, enabling the lungs to expand and thus facilitate breathing by expanding the chest cavity.  They serve to protect the lungs, heart, and other internal organs of the thorax.  In some animals, especially snakes, ribs may provide support and protection for the entire body. Human anatomy Humans have 24 ribs (12 pairs).  The first seven sets of ribs, known as "true ribs" (costae verae) also known as vertebrosternal ribs, are directly attached to the sternum through the costal cartilage. 

Sea butterfly<====>44594<====>Sea butterfly Sea butterflies, scientific name Thecosomata (thecosomes,  "case/shell-body" ), are a taxonomic suborder of small pelagic swimming sea snails.  These are holoplanktonic opisthobranch gastropod mollusks in the informal group Opisthobranchia.   They include some of the world's most abundant gastropod species.    Along with its sister group, the Gymnosomata, this group is included in the pteropods.  The validity of this clade is not unanimously established; although it had fallen out of favour for a number of years, recent molecular evidence suggests that the taxon should be resurrected.   Most Thecosomata have a calcified shell, whereas mature Gymnosomata do not. 

Positronium<====>44596<====>Positronium Positronium (Ps) is a system consisting of an electron and its anti-particle, a positron, bound together into an exotic atom, specifically an onium.   The system is unstable: the two particles annihilate each other to predominantly produce two or three gamma-rays, depending on the relative spin states.   The orbit and energy levels of the two particles are similar to that of the hydrogen atom (which is a bound state of a proton and an electron).  However, because of the reduced mass, the frequencies of the spectral lines are less than half of the corresponding hydrogen lines. 

National parks of Scotland<====>44597<====>National parks of ScotlandThe national parks of Scotland are managed areas of outstanding landscape where some forms of development are restricted to preserve the landscape and natural environment.  At present, Scotland has two national parks: Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park, created in 2002, and the Cairngorms National Park, created in 2003.Unlike the national parks of many other countries, the national parks of Scotland are not owned by the government.  The majority of the land is in the ownership of private landowners (including conservation bodies such as the National Trust for Scotland), and people continue to live and work in the parks. 

Chalcedony<====>44599<====>Chalcedony Chalcedony ( ) is a cryptocrystalline form of silica, composed of very fine intergrowths of quartz and moganite. These are both silica minerals, but they differ in that quartz has a trigonal crystal structure, while moganite is monoclinic.  Chalcedony's standard chemical structure (based on the chemical structure of quartz) is SiO 2  (silicon dioxide). Chalcedony has a waxy luster, and may be semitransparent or translucent.   It can assume a wide range of colors, but those most commonly seen are white to gray, grayish-blue or a shade of brown ranging from pale to nearly black. 

Carnelian<====>44600<====>Carnelian    Carnelian (also spelled cornelian ) is a brownish-red mineral commonly used as a semi-precious gemstone.   Similar to carnelian is sard, which is generally harder and darker (the difference is not rigidly defined, and the two names are often used interchangeably).  Both carnelian and sard are varieties of the silica mineral chalcedony colored by impurities of iron oxide.   The color can vary greatly, ranging from pale orange to an intense almost-black coloration.  It is most common in Brazil, India, Siberia and Germany. History The red variety of chalcedony is known as beads since the Early Neolithic in Bulgaria. 

Calcite<====>44603<====>Calcite Calcite is a carbonate mineral and the most stable polymorph of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ).  The Mohs scale of mineral hardness, based on scratch hardness comparison, defines value 3 as "calcite". Other polymorphs of calcium carbonate are the minerals aragonite and vaterite.  Aragonite will change to calcite at 380–470 °C,  and vaterite is even less stable. EtymologyCalcite is derived from the German Calcit, a term coined in the 19th century from the Latin word for lime, calx (genitive calcis) with the suffix -ite used to name minerals.  It is thus etymologically related to chalk.  "Alabaster", as used by archaeologistsWhen applied by archaeologists and stone trade professionals, the term alabaster is used not just as in geology and mineralogy, where it is reserved for a variety of gypsum; but also for a similar-looking,  translucent variety of fine-grained banded deposit of calcite. 

Ars Magica<====>44605<====>Ars Magica   Ars Magica is a role-playing game set in 'Mythic Europe' - a historically-grounded version of Europe and the Levant around AD 1200, with the added conceit that conceptions of the world prevalent in folklore and institutions of the High Middle Ages are factual reality (a situation known informally as the 'medieval paradigm').

Most protected areas are intended for the conservation of flora and fauna.  National parks are maintained by South African National Parks (SANParks).   A number of national parks have been incorporated in transfrontier conservation areas. Protected areas may also be protected for their value and importance as historical, cultural heritage or scientific sites.  More information on these can be found in the list of heritage sites in South Africa.

Almost everywhere<====>44688<====>Almost everywhere In measure theory (a branch of mathematical analysis), a property holds almost everywhere if, in a technical sense, the set for which the property holds takes up nearly all possibilities.   The notion of almost everywhere is a companion notion to the concept of measure zero.   In the subject of probability, which is largely based in measure theory, the notion is referred to as almost surely. More specifically, a property holds almost everywhere if the set of elements for which the property does not hold is a set of measure zero (Halmos 1974), or equivalently if the set of elements for which the property holds is conull. 

Pope Leo I<====>44692<====>Pope Leo I Pope Saint Leo I (  400 – 10 November 461), also known as Saint Leo the Great, was Pope from 29 September 440 to his death in 461.  Pope Benedict XVI said that Leo's papacy ". . . was undoubtedly one of the most important in the Church's history. " He was a Roman aristocrat, and was the first pope to have been called "the Great".  He is perhaps best known for having met Attila the Hun in 452 and persuading him to turn back from his invasion of Italy.  He is also a Doctor of the Church, most remembered theologically for issuing the Tome of Leo, a document which was a major foundation to the debates of the Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon. 

It Happened One Night<====>44696<====>It Happened One Night   It Happened One Night is a 1934 American pre-Code romantic comedy film with elements of screwball comedy directed and co-produced by Frank Capra, in collaboration with Harry Cohn, in which a pampered socialite (Claudette Colbert) tries to get out from under her father's thumb and falls in love with a roguish reporter (Clark Gable).  The plot is based on the August 1933 short story "Night Bus" by Samuel Hopkins Adams, which provided the shooting title.  One of the last romantic comedies created before the MPAA began enforcing the 1930 production code in 1934, the film was released on February 22, 1934. 

Zinoviev letter<====>44698<====>Zinoviev letter  The "Zinoviev letter" was a controversial document published by the British Daily Mail newspaper four days before the general election in 1924.  It purported to be a directive from Grigory Zinoviev, the head of the Communist International (Comintern) in Moscow, to the Communist Party of Great Britain, ordering it to engage in all sorts of seditious activities.  It said the resumption of diplomatic relations (by a Labour government) would hasten the radicalisation of the British working class.  If true, it was a deeply offensive interference in British politics to the detriment of the Labour Party. 

Leprosy<====>44700<====>Leprosy    Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease (HD), is a long-term infection by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae or Mycobacterium lepromatosis. Initially, infections are without symptoms and typically remain this way for 5 to 20 years.Symptoms that develop include granulomas of the nerves, respiratory tract, skin, and eyes.   This may result in a lack of ability to feel pain, thus loss of parts of extremities due to repeated injuries or infection due to unnoticed wounds.   Weakness and poor eyesight may also be present.   Leprosy is spread between people. 

House of Bourbon<====>44705<====>House of Bourbon   The House of Bourbon ( ;  ) is a European royal house of French origin, a branch of the Capetian dynasty ( ).  Bourbonic kings first ruled France and Navarre in the 16th century.  By the 18th century, members of the Spanish Bourbon dynasty held thrones in Spain, Naples, Sicily, and Parma.  Spain and Luxembourg currently have monarchs of the House of Bourbon. The royal Bourbons originated in 1272 when the heiress of the lordship of Bourbon married the youngest son of King Louis IX.

Genre<====>44706<====>Genre  Genre ( ;  ) is any form or type of communication in any mode (written, spoken, digital, artistic, etc. ) with socially-agreed upon conventions developed over time.  Genre is most popularly known as a category of literature, music, or other forms of art or entertainment, whether written or spoken, audio or visual, based on some set of stylistic criteria, yet genres can be aesthetic, rhetorical, communicative, or functional.  Genres form by conventions that change over time as new genres are invented and the use of old ones is discontinued.  Often, works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions. 

Ferroelectricity<====>44708<====>FerroelectricityFerroelectricity is a characteristic of certain materials that have a spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by the application of an external electric field.   The term is used in analogy to ferromagnetism, in which a material exhibits a permanent magnetic moment.  Ferromagnetism was already known when ferroelectricity was discovered in 1920 in Rochelle salt by Valasek.  See   and    Thus, the prefix ferro, meaning iron, was used to describe the property despite the fact that most ferroelectric materials do not contain iron. PolarizationWhen most materials are polarized, the polarization induced, P, is almost exactly proportional to the applied external electric field E; so the polarization is a linear function. 

Thomas Kyd<====>44710<====>Thomas Kyd   Thomas Kyd (baptised 6 November 1558; buried 15 August 1594) was an English playwright, the author of The Spanish Tragedy, and one of the most important figures in the development of Elizabethan drama. Although well known in his own time, Kyd fell into obscurity until 1773 when Thomas Hawkins, an early editor of The Spanish Tragedy, discovered that Kyd was named as its author by Thomas Heywood in his Apologie for Actors (1612).  A hundred years later, scholars in Germany and England began to shed light on his life and work, including the controversial finding that he may have been the author of a Hamlet play pre-dating Shakespeare's, which is now known as the Ur-Hamlet. 

Early texts of Shakespeare's works<====>44711<====>Early texts of Shakespeare's worksThe earliest texts of William Shakespeare's works were published during the 16th and 17th centuries in quarto or folio format.  Folios are large, tall volumes; quartos are smaller, roughly half the size (see Book size).  The publications of the latter are usually abbreviated to Q1, Q2, etc. , where the letter stands for "quarto" and the number for the first, second, or third edition published. Quartos Eighteen of the 36 plays in the First Folio were printed in separate and individual editions prior to 1623.  Pericles (1609) and The Two Noble Kinsmen (1634) also appeared separately before their inclusions in folio collections (the Shakespeare Third Folio and the second Beaumont and  Fletcher folio, respectively). 

Evil clown<====>44712<====>Evil clown    The evil clown is a subversion of the traditional comic clown character, in which the playful trope is instead rendered as disturbing through the use of horror elements and dark humor.  The modern archetype of the evil clown was popularized by Stephen King's 1986 novel It.  The character can be seen as playing off the sense of unease felt by sufferers of coulrophobia. OriginsThe modern archetype of the evil clown has unclear origins; the stock character appeared infrequently during the 19th century, in such works as Edgar Allan Poe's "Hop-Frog",    which is believed by Jack Morgan, of the University of Missouri-Rolla, to draw upon an earlier incident "at a masquerade ball", in the 14th century, during which "the king and his frivolous party, costumed—in highly flammable materials—as simian creatures, were ignited by a flambeau and incinerated, the King narrowly escaping in the actual case. 

Everyman (play)<====>44713<====>Everyman (play)    The Somonyng of Everyman (The Summoning of Everyman), usually referred to simply as Everyman, is a late 15th-century morality play.  Like John Bunyan's 1678 Christian novel The Pilgrim's Progress, Everyman uses allegorical characters to examine the question of Christian salvation and what Man must do to attain it. SummaryThe premise is that the good and evil deeds of one's life will be tallied by God after death, as in a ledger book.  The play is the allegorical accounting of the life of Everyman, who represents all mankind.  In the course of the action, Everyman tries to convince other characters to accompany him in the hope of improving his account. 

Karplus–Strong string synthesis<====>44714<====>Karplus–Strong string synthesis Karplus–Strong string synthesis is a method of physical modelling synthesis that loops a short waveform through a filtered delay line to simulate the sound of a hammered or plucked string or some types of percussion.  At first glance, this technique can be viewed as subtractive synthesis based on a feedback loop similar to that of a comb filter for z-transform analysis.  However, it can also be viewed as the simplest class of wavetable-modification algorithms now known as digital waveguide synthesis, because the delay line acts to store one period of the signal. Alexander Strong invented the algorithm, and Kevin Karplus did the first analysis of how it worked. 

Morality play<====>44715<====>Morality play The morality play is a genre of Medieval and early Tudor theatrical entertainment.  In their own time, these plays were known as interludes, a broader term for dramas with or without a moral.   Morality plays are a type of allegory in which the protagonist is met by personifications of various moral attributes who try to prompt him to choose a Godly life over one of evil.  The plays were most popular in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries.  Having grown out of the religiously based mystery plays of the Middle Ages, they represented a shift towards a more secular base for European theatre. 

Barbed tape<====>44716<====>Barbed tape Barbed tape or razor wire is a mesh of metal strips with sharp edges whose purpose is to prevent passage by humans.  The term "razor wire", through long usage, has generally been used to describe barbed tape products.  Razor wire is much sharper than the standard barbed wire; it is named after its appearance, but is not razor sharp.  The points are very sharp and made to rip and grab onto clothing and flesh. The multiple blades of a razor wire fence are designed to inflict serious cuts on anyone attempting to climb through and therefore have a strong psychological deterrent effect. 

Soapstone<====>44718<====>SoapstoneSoapstone (also known as steatite, or soaprock) is a talc-schist, which is a type of metamorphic rock.   It is largely composed of the mineral talc and is thus rich in magnesium.   It is produced by dynamothermal metamorphism and metasomatism, which occurs in the zones where tectonic plates are subducted, changing rocks by heat and pressure, with influx of fluids, but without melting.  It has been a medium for carving for thousands of years. PetrologyPetrologically, soapstone is composed dominantly of talc, with varying amounts of chlorite and amphiboles (typically tremolite, anthophyllite, and cummingtonite, hence its obsolete name, magnesiocummingtonite), and trace to minor iron-chromium oxides. 

Judge<====>44719<====>Judge    A judge is a person who   over court proceedings, either alone or as a part of a panel of judges.  The powers, functions, method of appointment, discipline, and training of judges vary widely across different jurisdictions.  The judge is supposed to conduct the trial   and, typically, in an open court.  The judge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the barristers of the case, assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties, and then issues a ruling on the matter at hand based on his or her interpretation of the law and his or her own personal judgment. 

Jury<====>44720<====>Jury   A jury is a sworn body of people convened to render an impartial verdict (a finding of fact on a question) officially submitted to them by a court, or to set a penalty or judgment.  Modern juries tend to be found in courts to ascertain the guilt, or lack thereof, in a crime.   In Anglophone jurisdictions, the verdict may be guilty or not guilty (not proven; a verdict of acquittal, based on the state's failure to prove guilt rather than any proof of innocence, is also available in Scotland).  The old institution of grand juries still exists in some places, particularly the United States, to investigate whether enough evidence of a crime exists to bring someone to trial. 

Intaglio (burial mound)<====>44722<====>Intaglio (burial mound)Intaglio (from    ) is a term from art applied to burial mounds that refers to a design cut into a hard surface.  In this case, the burial mounds have designs cut into the ground, though intaglio broadly applies to burial mounds which are raised above the natural surface of the terrain.   There are much more rare forms where they are left as indents below the natural terrain.   These are typically in some effigy shape such as the Panther Intaglio Effigy Mound, which can be seen in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, where it is the last remaining intaglio mound in the state. 

Printing<====>44723<====>Printing   Printing is a process for reproducing text and images using a master form or template.  The earliest non-paper products involving printing  include cylinder seals and objects such as the Cyrus Cylinder and the Cylinders of Nabonidus.  The earliest known form of printing as applied to paper was woodblock printing, which appeared in China before 220 A. D.  Shelagh Vainker in Anne Farrer (ed), "Caves of the Thousand Buddhas", 1990, British Museum publications,    Later developments in printing technology include the movable type invented by Bi Sheng around 1040 AD    and the printing press invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century. 

Cavalcade (play)<====>44725<====>Cavalcade (play) Cavalcade is a play by Noël Coward with songs by Coward and others.  It focuses on three decades in the life of the Marryots, a quintessential British family, and their servants, beginning in 1900 and ends on New Year's Eve in 1929 and is set against major historical events of the period, including the Relief of Mafeking; the death of Queen Victoria; the sinking of the Titanic; and World War I.   The popular songs at the time of each event were interwoven into the score. The play was premièred in London in 1931 at the large Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. 

Magnetoresistance<====>44726<====>MagnetoresistanceMagnetoresistance is the tendency of a material to change the value of its electrical resistance in an externally-applied magnetic field.  There are a variety of effects that can be called magnetoresistance: some occur in bulk non-magnetic metals and semiconductors, such as geometrical magnetoresistance, Shubnikov de Haas oscillations, or the common positive magnetoresistance in metals.   Other effects occur in magnetic metals, such as negative magnetoresistance in ferromagnets    or anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR).  Finally, in multicomponent or multilayer systems (e. g.  magnetic tunnel junctions), giant magnetoresistance (GMR), tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR), colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), and extraordinary magnetoresistance (EMR) can be observed. 

Burgos<====>44730<====>Burgos  Burgos ( ,  ,  ) is a city in northern Spain and the historic capital of Castile.  It is situated on the confluence of the Arlanzón river tributaries, at the edge of the Iberian central plateau.  It has about 180,000 inhabitants in the actual city and another 20,000 in the metropolitan area.  It is the capital of the province of Burgos, in the autonomous community of Castile and León.  Burgos was once the capital of the Crown of Castile, and the Burgos Laws or Leyes de Burgos which first governed the behaviour of Spaniards towards the natives of the Americas were promulgated here in 1512. 

Calcium carbonate<====>44731<====>Calcium carbonate  Calcium carbonate is a chemical compound with the formula CaCO 3 .  It is a common substance found in rocks as the minerals calcite and aragonite (most notably as limestone, which contains both of those minerals) and is the main component of pearls and the shells of marine organisms, snails, and eggs.  Calcium carbonate is the active ingredient in agricultural lime and is created when calcium ions in hard water react with carbonate ions to create limescale.  It is medicinally used as a calcium supplement or as an antacid, but excessive consumption can be hazardous. 

Emmanuelle Seigner<====>44733<====>Emmanuelle Seigner   Emmanuelle Seigner (born 22 June 1966) is a French actress, former fashion model, and singer.  She is known for her roles in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (2007), The Ninth Gate (1999) and Frantic (1988).  She has been nominated for a César Award for Best Actress for Venus in Fur (2013), and for two César Awards for Best Supporting Actress in Place Vendôme (1998) and La Vie En Rose (2007).She is married to French-Polish director Roman Polanski. Life and careerSeigner was born in Paris to a photographer father and a journalist mother. 

Chalk<====>44734<====>Chalk    Chalk ( ) is a soft, white, porous, sedimentary carbonate rock, a form of limestone composed of the mineral calcite.  Calcite is an ionic salt called calcium carbonate or CaCO 3 .  It forms under reasonably deep marine conditions from the gradual accumulation of minute calcite shells (coccoliths) shed from micro-organisms called coccolithophores.  Flint (a type of chert) is very common as bands parallel to the bedding or as nodules embedded in chalk.  It is probably derived from sponge spicules or other siliceous organisms as water is expelled upwards during compaction.  Flint is often deposited around larger fossils such as Echinoidea which may be silicified (i. 

Sharon Tate<====>44735<====>Sharon Tate  Sharon Marie Tate Polanski (January 24, 1943 – August 9, 1969) was an American actress and model.  During the 1960s, she played small television roles before appearing in films and was regularly featured in fashion magazines as a model and cover girl.  After receiving positive reviews for her comedic and dramatic acting performances, Tate was hailed as one of Hollywood's most promising newcomers.  She made her film debut in 1966 with the occult-themed Eye of the Devil.  Her most remembered performance was as Jennifer North in the 1967 cult classic film, Valley of the Dolls, earning her a Golden Globe Award nomination. 

Ionian Sea<====>44736<====>Ionian Sea The Ionian Sea ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) is an elongated embayment of the Mediterranean Sea, south of the Adriatic Sea.  It is bounded by southern Italy including Calabria, Sicily, and the Salento peninsula to the west, southern Albania to the north, and the west coast of Greece. All major islands in the sea belong to Greece.  They are collectively referred to as the Ionian Islands, the main ones being Corfu, Zakynthos, Kephalonia, Ithaca, and Lefkada. There are ferry routes between Patras and Igoumenitsa, Greece, and Brindisi and Ancona, Italy, that cross the east and north of the Ionian Sea, and from Piraeus westward. 

Bulgars<====>44737<====>Bulgars  The Bulgars (also Bulghars, Bulgari, Bolgars, Bolghars, Bolgari,  pre-Bulgarians, Proto-Bulgarians ) were Turkic semi-nomadic warrior tribes that flourished in the Pontic-Caspian steppe and the Volga region during the 7th century.  Emerging as nomadic equestrians in the Volga-Ural region, according to some researchers their roots can be traced to Central Asia.During their westward migration across the Eurasian steppe the Bulgars absorbed other ethnic groups and cultural influences, including Hunnic and Indo-European peoples.  Modern genetic research on Central Asian Turkic people and ethnic groups related to the Bulgars points to an affiliation with Western Eurasian  populations. 

Diabetes insipidus<====>44738<====>Diabetes insipidus  Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a condition characterized by large amounts of dilute urine and increased thirst.The amount of urine produced can be nearly 20 liters per day.   Reduction of fluid has little effect on the concentration of the urine.   Complications may include dehydration or seizures.   There are four types of DI, each with a different set of causes.   Central DI (CDI) is due to a lack of the hormone vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone).   This can be due to damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland or genetics. 

Aria<====>44739<====>Aria  An aria ( ;  ; plural: arie  , or arias in common usage, diminutive form arietta   or ariette) in music was originally any expressive melody, usually, but not always, performed by a singer.  The term became used almost exclusively to describe a self-contained piece for one voice, with or without instrumental or orchestral  accompaniment, normally part of a larger work.  The typical context for arias is opera, but vocal arias also feature in oratorios and cantatas, sharing features of the operatic arias of their periods. Origins of the termThe term, which derives from the Greek and Latin 'aer' (air) first appeared in relation to music in the 14th century when it simply signified a manner or style of singing or playing. 

Turkic peoples<====>44740<====>Turkic peoples  The Turkic peoples are a collection of ethno-linguistic groups of Central, Eastern, Northern and Western Asia as well as parts of Europe and North Africa.  They speak related languages belonging to the Turkic language family.  Turkic people, Encyclopædia Britannica, Online Academic Edition, 2010  As racial purity has never been a Turkic membership criterion, many vastly differing ethnic groups have throughout history become part of the Turkic peoples through language shift, acculturation, adoption and religious conversion in a process called Turkification.  In their genetic compositions, therefore, most Turkic groups differ significantly in origins from one group to the next, lacking one single historical founder population. 

Thomas Hardy<====>44743<====>Thomas Hardy    Thomas Hardy, OM (2 June 1840 – 11 January 1928) was an English novelist and poet.  A Victorian realist in the tradition of George Eliot, he was influenced both in his novels and in his poetry by Romanticism, especially William Wordsworth.   He was highly critical of much in Victorian society, especially on the declining status of rural people in Britain, such as those from his native South West England. While Hardy wrote poetry throughout his life and regarded himself primarily as a poet, his first collection was not published until 1898.  Initially, therefore, he gained fame as the author of such novels as Far from the Madding Crowd (1874), The Mayor of Casterbridge (1886), Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1891), and Jude the Obscure (1895). 

Boca Raton, Florida<====>44745<====>Boca Raton, Florida   Boca Raton ( ;   ,  ) is the southernmost city in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States, first incorporated on August 2, 1924  as "Bocaratone,"  and then incorporated as "Boca Raton" in 1925.  The 2015 population estimated by the U. S.  Census Bureau was 93,235.   However, approximately 200,000 people with a Boca Raton postal address reside outside its municipal boundaries.   Such areas include newer developments like West Boca Raton.  As a business center, the city also experiences significant daytime population increases.  It is one of the wealthiest communities in South Florida. 

Mel Blanc<====>44748<====>Mel Blanc  Melvin Jerome Blank (May 30, 1908 – July 10, 1989), known professionally as Mel Blanc, was an American voice actor, radio comedian and recording artist.  After beginning his 60-plus-year career performing in radio, he became known for his work in animation as the voices of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Tweety Bird, Sylvester the Cat, Yosemite Sam, Foghorn Leghorn, Marvin the Martian, Pepé Le Pew, Speedy Gonzales, Wile E.  Coyote, Road Runner,    the Tasmanian Devil and many of the other characters from the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies theatrical cartoons during the golden age of American animation. 

In Old Arizona<====>44749<====>In Old Arizona In Old Arizona is a 1928 American Pre-Code Western film directed by Irving Cummings and Raoul Walsh, nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture.  The film, which was based on the character of the Cisco Kid in the story "The Caballero's Way" by O.  Henry, was a major innovation in Hollywood.  It was the first major Western to use the new technology of sound and the first talkie to be filmed outdoors.  It made extensive use of authentic locations, filming in Bryce Canyon National Park and Zion National Park in Utah, and the Mission San Juan Capistrano and the Mojave Desert in California. 

Driftwood<====>44750<====>Driftwood  Driftwood is wood that has been washed onto a shore or beach of a sea, lake, or river by the action of winds, tides or waves.  It is a form of marine debris or tidewrack. In some waterfront areas, driftwood is a major nuisance.  However, the driftwood provides shelter and food for birds, fish and other aquatic species as it floats in the ocean.  Gribbles, shipworms and bacteria decompose the wood and gradually turn it into nutrients that are reintroduced to the food web.  Sometimes, the partially decomposed wood washes ashore, where it also shelters birds, plants, and other species. 

Grand Hotel (1932 film)<====>44752<====>Grand Hotel (1932 film) Grand Hotel is a 1932 American pre-Code Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer drama film directed by Edmund Goulding.  The screenplay by William A.  Drake is based on the 1930 play of the same title by Drake, who had adapted it from the 1929 novel Menschen im Hotel by Vicki Baum.  To date, it is the only film to have won the Academy Award for Best Picture without being nominated in any other category. The film was remade as Week-End at the Waldorf in 1945, and also served as the basis for the 1989 stage musical of the same title. 

Akiko Yano<====>44754<====>Akiko Yanois a Japanese pop and jazz musician and singer.  She was born Akiko Suzuki (鈴木 顕子 Suzuki Akiko) in Tokyo and raised in Aomori, Aomori, and later began her singing career in the mid-1970s.  Her vocals and singing style have been compared to British singer Kate Bush.  She has recorded with Yellow Magic Orchestra and its members Ryuichi Sakamoto, Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi, as well as with Swing Out Sister, Pat Metheny, The Chieftains, Lyle Mays, members of Little Feat, David Sylvian, Mick Karn, Kenji Omura, Gil Goldstein, Toninho Horta, Mino Cinelu, Jeff Bova, Charlie Haden, Peter Erskine, Anthony Jackson, David Rhodes, Bill Frisell, Thomas Dolby, the band Quruli, Rei Harakami as yanokami and her daughter Miu Sakamoto. 

William of Tyre<====>44755<====>William of Tyre    William of Tyre ( ;   1130 – 29 September 1186) was a medieval prelate and chronicler.  As archbishop of Tyre, he is sometimes known as William II to distinguish him from his predecessor, William I, the Englishman and former Prior of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, who was Archbishop of Tyre from 1127-1135.   He grew up in Jerusalem at the height of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which had been established in 1099 after the First Crusade, and he spent twenty years studying the liberal arts and canon law in the universities of Europe. 

List of national parks of Sweden<====>44756<====>List of national parks of Sweden National parks of Sweden are managed by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ( ) and owned by the state.  The goal of the national park service is to create a system of protected areas that represent all the distinct natural regions of the country.   In 1909, Sweden became the first country in Europe to establish such parks when nine were opened following the Riksdag passing of a law on national parks that year.  This was followed by the establishment of seven parks between 1918 and 1962 and thirteen between 1982 and 2009, with the latest being Kosterhavet National Park. 

University of California, Irvine<====>44757<====>University of California, Irvine The University of California, Irvine (UCI, UC Irvine, or Irvine), is a public research university located in Irvine,  Orange County, California, United States, and one of the 10 campuses in the University of California (UC) system.  UC Irvine offers 80 undergraduate degrees and 98 graduate and professional degrees.  The university is designated as having very high research activity in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, and in fiscal year 2013 had $348 million in research and development expenditures according to the National Science Foundation.   UC Irvine became a member of the Association of American Universities in 1996, and is the youngest university to hold membership. 

Goldbach's conjecture<====>44758<====>Goldbach's conjectureGoldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and all of mathematics.  It states:Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.    The conjecture has been shown to hold for all integers less than 4 × 10 18 ,  but remains unproven despite considerable effort. Goldbach numberA Goldbach number is a positive even integer that can be expressed as the sum of two odd primes.    Since four is the only even number greater than two that requires the even prime 2 in order to be written as the sum of two primes, another form of the statement of Goldbach's conjecture is that all even integers greater than 4 are Goldbach numbers. 

Confectionery<====>44760<====>Confectionery    Confectionery,also called sweets or candy, is sweet food.  The term varies among English-speaking countries.   In general, though, confectionery is divided into two broad and somewhat overlapping categories, bakers' confections and sugar confections.  Bakers' confectionery, also called flour confections, includes principally sweet pastries, cakes, and similar baked goods.  In the Middle East and Asia, flour-based confections are more dominant. Sugar confectionery includes sweets, candy, candied nuts, chocolates, chewing gum and bubblegum, sweetmeats, pastillage, and other confections that are made primarily of sugar.   In some cases, chocolate confections (confections made of chocolate) are treated as a separate category, as are sugar-free versions of sugar confections.

The other major cities of the Elymians were Eryx and Entella.  It is located in the northwestern part of Sicily in Italy, near the modern comune of Calatafimi-Segesta in the province of Trapani.  The Hellenization of Segesta happened very early and had a profound effect on its people.  HistoryAccording to the tradition used in Virgil's Aeneid, Segesta was founded jointly by the territorial king Acestes (who was son of the local river Crinisus by a Dardanian woman named Segesta or Egesta) and by those of Aeneas' folk who wished to remain behind with Acestes to found the city of Acesta. 

The Hollywood Revue of 1929<====>44771<====>The Hollywood Revue of 1929 The Hollywood Revue of 1929 is an American Pre-Code musical comedy film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  It was the studio's second feature-length musical, and one of their earliest sound films.  Produced by Harry Rapf and Irving Thalberg and directed by Charles Reisner, it features nearly all of MGM's stars in a two-hour revue that includes three segments in Technicolor.  The masters of ceremonies are Conrad Nagel and Jack Benny. ProductionUnlike M-G-M's imposing feature films, which always boasted strong story values, The Hollywood Revue of 1929 was a plotless parade of variety acts.  Conrad Nagel, interviewed for the book The Real Tinsel, recalled, "Everybody thought Harry Rapf was crazy for making it. 

Calabria<====>44772<====>Calabria  Calabria ( ;   in Calabrian,   in Calabrian Greek,   in Greek,   in Arbëresh/Albanian), known in antiquity as Bruttium, is a region in Southern Italy. The capital city of Calabria is Catanzaro.  The Regional Council of Calabria is based at the Palazzo Campanella in the city of Reggio Calabria.  The region is bordered to the north by the Basilicata Region, to the west by the Tyrrhenian Sea, and to the east by the Ionian Sea.  The region covers   and has a population of just under 2 million.  The demonym of Calabria is calabrese in Italian and Calabrian in English. 

Yakuza<====>44774<====>Yakuza, also known as  , are members of transnational organized crime syndicates originating in Japan.  The Japanese police, and media by request of the police, call them  , while the yakuza call themselves  .  The yakuza are notorious for their strict codes of conduct and their organized fiefdom-nature.  They have a large presence in the Japanese media and operate internationally with an estimated 102,000 members.  EtymologyThe name "Yakuza" originates from the traditional Japanese card game Oicho-Kabu, a game in which the goal is to draw 3 cards adding up to a value of 9. 

Complete measure<====>44775<====>Complete measure In mathematics, a complete measure (or, more precisely, a complete measure space) is a measure space in which every subset of every null set is measurable (having measure zero).  More formally, (X, Σ, μ) is complete if and only if S \subseteq N \in \Sigma \mbox{ and } \mu(N) = 0\ \Rightarrow\ S \in \Sigma.  MotivationThe need to consider questions of completeness can be illustrated by considering the problem of product spaces. Suppose that we have already constructed Lebesgue measure on the real line: denote this measure space by (R, B, λ).  We now wish to construct some two-dimensional Lebesgue measure λ 2  on the plane R 2  as a product measure. 

Catania<====>44776<====>Catania   Catania ( ) is the second largest city of Sicily located on the east coast facing the Ionian Sea.  It is the capital of the Metropolitan City of Catania, one of the ten biggest cities in Italy, and the seventh largest metropolitan area in Italy.  The population of the city proper is 313,000 while the population of the city's metropolitan area, Metropolitan City of Catania, stood at 1,116,168 inhabitants. Catania is well known for its historical earthquakes, having been destroyed by catastrophic earthquakes in 1169    and 1693, and for several volcanic eruptions from the neighbouring Mount Etna, the most violent of which was in 1669. 

Complete lattice<====>44777<====>Complete latticeIn mathematics, a complete lattice is a partially ordered set in which all subsets have both a supremum (join) and an infimum (meet).  Complete lattices appear in many applications in mathematics and computer science.  Being a special instance of lattices, they are studied both in order theory and universal algebra. Complete lattices must not be confused with complete partial orders (cpos), which constitute a strictly more general class of partially ordered sets.  More specific complete lattices are complete Boolean algebras and complete Heyting algebras (locales). Formal definitionA partially ordered set (L, ≤) is a complete lattice if every subset A of L has both a greatest lower bound (the infimum, also called the meet) and a least upper bound (the supremum, also called the join) in (L, ≤). 

Trapani<====>44778<====>Trapani   Trapani( ;  ,  ) is a city and comune on the west coast of Sicily in Italy.  It is the capital of the Province of Trapani.  Founded by Elymians, the city is still an important fishing port and the main gateway to the nearby Egadi Islands. History Trapani was founded by the Elymians to serve as the port of the nearby city of Erice (ancient Eryx), which overlooks it from Monte San Giuliano.  The city sits on a low-lying promontory jutting out into the Mediterranean Sea. It was originally named Drepana or Drépanon from the Greek word for "sickle", because of the curving shape of its harbour. 

Wilfred Bion<====>44779<====>Wilfred Bion  Wilfred Ruprecht Bion DSO ( ; 8 September 1897 – 8 November 1979) was an influential British psychoanalyst, who became president of the British Psychoanalytical Society from 1962 to 1965.  Wilfred Bion was a potent and original contributor to psychoanalysis.  He was one of the first to analyze patients in psychotic states using an unmodified analytic technique; he extended existing theories of projective processes and developed new conceptual tools.  The degree of collaboration between Hanna Segal, Wilfred Bion and Herbert Rosenfeld in their work with psychotic patients during the late 1950s, and their discussions with Melanie Klein at the time, means that it is not always possible to distinguish their exact individual contributions to the developing theory of splitting, projective identification, unconscious phantasy and the use of countertransference. 

Gibellina<====>44780<====>Gibellina  Gibellina (Sicilian: Gibbiddina) is a small city and comune in the mountains of central Sicily, Italy in the Province of Trapani.  It was destroyed by the 1968 Belice earthquake.  The new city, Gibellina Nuova, was rebuilt some   distant from the old one.   The new city was designed by many of the most prominent artists and architects in Italy, but done in a piecemeal fashion so that the parts of the new city bear little relation to one another or to the indigenous architecture of Sicily. Ruderi di Gibellina (as the ruins of the city are now referred to) remained just as it was after the earthquake, practically a ghost-town. 

Erice<====>44781<====>EriceFor the Spanish film director, see Victor Erice.  Erice ( ;  ) is a historic town and comune in the province of Trapani in Sicily, Italy. GeographyThe main town of Erice is located on top of Mount Erice, at around   above sea level, overlooking the city of Trapani, the low western coast towards Marsala, the dramatic Punta del Saraceno and Capo San Vito to the north-east, and the Aegadian Islands on Sicily's north-western coast.

Battle of Stirling Bridge<====>44782<====>Battle of Stirling Bridge    The Battle of Stirling Bridge was a battle of the First War of Scottish Independence.  On 11 September 1297, the forces of Andrew Moray and William Wallace defeated the combined English forces of John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey, and Hugh de Cressingham near Stirling, on the River Forth. BackgroundThe Earl of Surrey had won a victory over the aristocracy of Scotland at the Battle of Dunbar.  However, by August 1297 Moray and Wallace controlled almost all of Scotland north of the Forth, except for Dundee.  Surrey marched north with an army from Berwick to relieve Dundee. 

Apulia<====>44783<====>Apulia   Apulia (   ;    ;    ;  ;  , Apoulia) is a region of Italy in Southern Italy bordering the Adriatic Sea to the east, the Ionian Sea to the southeast, and the Strait of Òtranto and Gulf of Taranto to the south.

Bari is made up of four different urban sections. 

Dream<====>44785<====>Dream  A dream is a succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep.   The content and purpose of dreams are not fully understood, though they have been a topic of scientific speculation, as well as a subject of philosophical and religious interest, throughout recorded history.  Dream interpretation is the attempt at drawing meaning from dreams and searching for an underlying message.  The scientific study of dreams is called oneirology.  Dreams mainly occur in the rapid-eye movement (REM) stage of sleep—when brain activity is high and resembles that of being awake. 

Up to<====>44787<====>Up toIn mathematics, the phrase up to appears in discussions about the elements of a set (say S), and the conditions under which subsets of those elements may be considered equivalent.  The statement "elements a and b of set S are equivalent up to X" means that a and b are equivalent if criterion X (such as rotation or permutation) is ignored.  That is, a and b can be transformed into one another if a transform corresponding to X (rotation, permutation etc. ) is applied. Looking at the entire set S, when X is ignored the elements can be arranged in subsets whose elements are equivalent ("equivalent up to X"). 

Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto<====>44789<====>Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto ( ; Sicilian: Baccialona Pizzaottu) is a town and comune of about 50,000 inhabitants in the north coast of Sicily, Italy,   from Messina towards Palermo.  It belongs to the Metropolitan City of Messina.

Settlement and necropolis, from around the 10th century BC, in Pizzo Lando. Settlement and necropolis of ancient Greek or Hellenistic times, assigned to 8th century BC, in Oliveto locality. 

Luminosity<====>44790<====>Luminosity  In astronomy, luminosity is the total amount of energy emitted by a star, galaxy, or other astronomical object per unit time.It is related to the brightness, which is the luminosity of an object in a given spectral region.  In SI units luminosity is measured in joules per second or watts.  Values for luminosity are often given in the terms of the luminosity of the Sun, L ⊙ .  Luminosity can also be given in terms of magnitude: the absolute bolometric magnitude (M bol ) of an object is a logarithmic measure of its total energy emission rate. 

Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act<====>44793<====>Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor ActThe Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA)    is an act of the United States Congress, passed in 1986 as part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA).  It requires hospital Emergency Departments that accept payments from Medicare to provide an appropriate medical screening examination (MSE) to anyone seeking treatment for a medical condition, regardless of citizenship, legal status, or ability to pay.  Participating hospitals may not transfer or discharge patients needing emergency treatment except with the informed consent or stabilization of the patient or when their condition requires transfer to a hospital better equipped to administer the treatment. 

Naburimannu<====>44794<====>NaburimannuNabu-ri-man-nu (also spelled Nabu-rimanni; Greek sources called him Ναβουριανός, Nabourianos, Latin Naburianus) (fl.  c.  6th – 3rd century BC) was a Chaldean astronomer and mathematician. Classical and ancient cuneiform sources mention an astronomer with this name:The Greek geographer Strabo of Amaseia, in Geography 16. 1–. 6, writes: "In Babylon a settlement is set apart for the local philosophers, the Chaldaeans, as they are called, who are concerned mostly with astronomy; but some of these, who are not approved of by the others, profess to be writers of horoscopes.  (There is also a tribe of the Chaldaeans, and a territory inhabited by them, in the neighborhood of the Arabs and of the Persian Gulf, as it is called. 

Giovanni Falcone<====>44796<====>Giovanni Falcone  Giovanni Falcone ( ; 18 May 1939 – 23 May 1992) was an Italian judge and prosecuting magistrate.  From his office in the Palace of Justice in Palermo, Sicily, he spent most of his professional life trying to overthrow the power of the Sicilian Mafia.  After a long and distinguished career, culminating in the Maxi Trial in 1986–1987, he was killed by the Corleonesi Mafia in May 1992, on the A29 motorway near the town of Capaci. His life parallels that of his close friend Paolo Borsellino.  They both spent their early years in the same neighbourhood in Palermo. 

Bagheria<====>44797<====>Bagheria Bagheria ( ; Sicilian: Baarìa) is a town and comune in the Metropolitan City of Palermo in Sicily, Italy. EtymologyAccording to some sources, the name Bagheria (by way of old Sicilian Baarìa) originates from the Phoenician term Bayharia meaning "land that descends toward the sea. " Other sources claim that it derives from the Arabic Bāb al-Gerib, or "windy gateway. " However, the most plausible explanation is that it drives from Arabic    , meaning 'of the sea, marine'.  HistorySince its founding, the town has gone by the names of Bayharia, Baharia, and Baarìa.  In 1658 Giuseppe Branciforti, Prince of Butera and  former Viceroy of Sicily, built a large villa and established the region as the preferred location for the vacation homes of Palermo's elites. 

Milazzo<====>44798<====>Milazzo Milazzo (Sicilian: Milazzu, Latin: Mylae ) is a town (comune) in the Metropolitan City of Messina, Sicily, southern Italy; it is the largest commune in the Metropolitan City after Messina and Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto.  The town has a population of around 31,500 inhabitants. HistorySeveral civilizations settled in Milazzo and left signs of their presence from the Neolithic age.  In Homer's Odyssey Milazzo is the place where Ulysses is shipwrecked and meets Polyphemus. Historically, the town originated as the ancient Mylae, an outpost of Zancle, occupied before 648 BC, perhaps as early as 716 BC.   It was taken by the Athenians in 426 BC. 

Termini Imerese<====>44800<====>Termini Imerese Termini Imerese  is a town and comune in the  Metropolitan City of Palermo on the northern coast of Sicily, southern Italy. HistoryAncient HistoryThe site of the town has been populated since prehistoric times, as many archaeologial excavations have shown through the years.  Its documented history begins in 409 BC after the second Battle of Himera when its more ancient neighbour, Himera (now completely within the comune's borders), was completely destroyed by the Carthaginian army under Hannibal Mago.  Those who survived the devastation moved to a site then called "Thermae" which is today known as Termini and became the successor to Himera. 

Pentito<====>44802<====>Pentito Italian term pentito ( ;  "repentant"; plural: pentiti) is used colloquially to designate people in Italy who were formerly part of criminal or terrorist organizations and who, following their arrests, decided to "repent" and collaborate with the judiciary to help further investigations.  The judicial category of pentiti was originally created in legislation passed by the Italian government in the 1970s to combat violence and terrorism during the so-called Years of Lead.  The correct technical name used for them is "collaborators of justice" ( ).  In the wake of the Maxi Trial in Palermo in 1986–87, and after the testimony of Tommaso Buscetta, the term came into widespread use in Italy for all former members of the Sicilian Mafia who had abandoned their organization and started helping investigators. 

Zakopane<====>44805<====>Zakopane  Zakopane is a town in the extreme south of Poland.  It lies in the southern part of the Podhale region at the foot of the Tatra Mountains.

Zakopane is near the border with Slovakia and lies in a valley between the Tatra Mountains and Gubałówka Hill. 

Syntactic category<====>44806<====>Syntactic categoryA syntactic category is a type of syntactic unit that theories of syntax assume.   Word classes, largely corresponding to traditional parts of speech (e. g.  noun, verb, preposition, etc. ), are syntactic categories.  In phrase structure grammars, the phrasal categories (e. g.  noun phrase, verb phrase, prepositional phrase, etc. ) are also syntactic categories.  Dependency grammars, however, do not acknowledge phrasal categories (at least not in the traditional sense). Word classes considered as syntactic categories may be called lexical categories, as distinct from phrasal categories.  The terminology here is by no means consistent, however. 

Corleone<====>44807<====>Corleone   Corleone ( ) (Sicilian: Cunigghiuni  or Curliuni ) is an Italian town and comune of roughly 11,158 inhabitants in the Metropolitan City of Palermo, in Sicily.

It shows traces of all cultures that have existed on the island of Sicily over the last two millennia.   Although its cuisine has a lot in common with Italian cuisine, Sicilian food also has Greek, Spanish, French and Arab influences.  The Sicilian cook Mithaecus, born during 5th century BC, is credited with having brought knowledge of Sicilian gastronomy to Greece:  his cookbook was the first in Greek, therefore he was the earliest cookbook author in any language whose name is known.

Pragmatics<====>44816<====>Pragmatics  Pragmatics is a subfield of linguistics and semiotics that studies the ways in which context contributes to meaning.  Pragmatics encompasses speech act theory, conversational implicature, talk in interaction and other approaches to language behavior in philosophy, sociology, linguistics and anthropology.  Mey, Jacob L.  (1993) Pragmatics: An Introduction.  Oxford: Blackwell (2nd ed.  2001).   Unlike semantics, which examines meaning that is conventional or "coded" in a given language, pragmatics studies how the transmission of meaning depends not only on structural and linguistic knowledge (e. g. , grammar, lexicon, etc. ) of the speaker and listener, but also on the context of the utterance,  any pre-existing knowledge about those involved, the inferred intent of the speaker, and other factors.

Speech act<====>44836<====>Speech act  A speech act in linguistics and the philosophy of language is an utterance that has performative function in language and communication.  According to Kent Bach, "almost any speech act is really the performance of several acts at once, distinguished by different aspects of the speaker's intention: there is the act of saying something, what one does in saying it, such as requesting or promising, and how one is trying to affect one's audience". The contemporary use of the term goes back to J.  L.  Austin's development of performative utterances and his theory of locutionary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary acts. 

Limit superior and limit inferior<====>44837<====>Limit superior and limit inferior In mathematics, the limit inferior and limit superior of a sequence can be thought of as limiting (i. e. , eventual and extreme) bounds on the sequence.  They can be thought of in a similar fashion for a function (see limit of a function).  For a set, they are the infimum and supremum of the set's limit points, respectively.  In general, when there are multiple objects around which a sequence, function, or set accumulates, the inferior and superior limits extract the smallest and largest of them; the type of object and the measure of size is context-dependent, but the notion of extreme limits is invariant. 

Manuel II Palaiologos<====>44839<====>Manuel II Palaiologos  Manuel II Palaiologos or Palaeologus (Greek: Μανουήλ Β΄ Παλαιολόγος, Manouēl II Palaiologos) (27 June 1350 – 21 July 1425) was Byzantine Emperor from 1391 to 1425.

Granted the title of despotēs by his father, the future Manuel II traveled west to seek support for the Byzantine Empire in 1365 and in 1370, serving as governor in Thessalonica from 1369. 

Deixis<====>44844<====>DeixisIn linguistics, deixis ( )  refers to words and phrases, such as “me” or “here”, that cannot be fully understood without additional contextual information -- in this case, the identity of the speaker (“me”) and the speaker's location (“here”).  Words are deictic if their semantic meaning is fixed but their denotational meaning varies depending on time and/or place.  Words or phrases that require contextual information to convey any meaning – for example, English pronouns – are deictic.  Deixis is closely related to anaphora, as will be further explained below.  Although this article deals primarily with deixis in spoken language, the concept is sometimes applied to written language, gestures, and communication media as well.

Engine department (ship)<====>44882<====>Engine department (ship) In maritime transportation, the engine department or engineering department is an organizational unit aboard a ship that is responsible for the operation, maintenance, and repair of the propulsion systems and the support systems for crew, passengers, and cargo.   It is also responsible for repairing and maintaining other systems on the ship, such as: Electrical Power Generation PlantLightingFuel oilLubricationWater distillation SeparationAir conditioning RefrigerationThe engine department emerged with the arrival of marine engines for propulsion, largely during the later half of the 19th century.

Welding<====>44883<====>Welding  Welding is a fabrication or sculptural process that joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing fusion, which is distinct from lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as brazing and soldering, which do not melt the base metal.  In addition to melting the base metal, a filler material is typically added to the joint to form a pool of molten material (the weld pool) that cools to form a joint that is usually stronger than the base material.  Pressure may also be used in conjunction with heat, or by itself, to produce a weld.  Welding also requires a form of shield to protect the filler metals or melted metals from being contaminated or oxidized. 

Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?<====>44885<====>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?  Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a play by Edward Albee first staged in 1962.  It examines the complexities of the marriage of a middle-aged couple, Martha and George.   Late one evening, after a university faculty party, they receive an unwitting younger couple, Nick and Honey, as guests, and draw them into their bitter and frustrated relationship.  The play is in three acts, normally taking a little less than three hours to perform, with two 10-minute intermissions.  The title is a pun on the song "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?" from Walt Disney's Three Little Pigs (1933), substituting for the name of the celebrated English author Virginia Woolf. 

Pope Sixtus V<====>44886<====>Pope Sixtus V Pope Sixtus V or Xystus V (13 December 1521 – 27 August 1590), born Felice Peretti di Montalto, was Pope of the Catholic Church  from 24 April 1585 to his death in 1590.  As a youth, he joined the Franciscan order, where he displayed talents as a scholar and preacher, and enjoyed the patronage of Pius V, who made him a cardinal. As Pope, he energetically rooted out corruption and lawlessness across Rome, and launched a far-sighted rebuilding programme that continues to provoke controversy, as it involved the destruction of antiquities.  The cost of these works was met by heavy taxation that caused much suffering. 

Robert Schumann<====>44887<====>Robert SchumannRobert Schumann  (8 June 1810 29 July 1856) was a German composer and influential music critic.  He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Romantic era.  Schumann left the study of law, intending to pursue a career as a virtuoso pianist.

Borel–Cantelli lemma<====>44987<====>Borel–Cantelli lemmaIn probability theory, the Borel–Cantelli lemma is a theorem about sequences of events.  In general, it is a result in measure theory.   It is named after Émile Borel and Francesco Paolo Cantelli, who gave statement to the lemma in the first decades of the 20th century.A related result, sometimes called the second Borel–Cantelli lemma, is a partial converse of the first Borel–Cantelli lemma.   The lemma states that, under certain conditions, an event will have probability of either zero or one.  Accordingly, it is the best-known of a class of similar theorems, known as zero-one laws. 

Chip carving<====>44988<====>Chip carvingChip carving or chip-carving, kerbschnitt in German, is a style of carving in which knives or chisels are used to remove small chips of the material from a flat surface in a single piece.   The style became important in Migration Period metalwork, mainly animal style jewellery, where the faceted surfaces created caught the light to give a glinting appearance.   This was very probably a transfer to metalworking of a technique already used in woodcarving, but no wooden examples have survived.  Famous Anglo-Saxon examples include the jewellery from Sutton Hoo and the Tassilo Chalice, though the style originated in mainland Europe. 

Ryan White<====>44990<====>Ryan White  Ryan Wayne White (December 6, 1971 – April 8, 1990)    was an American teenager from Kokomo, Indiana, who became a national poster child for HIV/AIDS in the United States after failing to be re-admitted to school following an AIDS diagnosis.  As a hemophiliac, he became infected with HIV from a contaminated blood treatment (Factor VIII) and, when diagnosed in December 1984, was given six months to live.  Doctors said he posed no risk to other students, but AIDS was poorly understood by the general public at the time.  When Ryan tried to return to school, many parents and teachers in Howard County rallied against his attendance due to concerns of the disease spreading through bodily fluid transfer. 

Pope Nicholas V<====>44993<====>Pope Nicholas V    Pope Nicholas V ( ) (13 November 1397 – 24 March 1455), born Tommaso Parentucelli, was Pope from 6 March 1447 until his death.   Pope Eugene made him a cardinal in 1446 after successful trips to Italy and Germany, and when Eugene died the next year Parentucelli was elected in his place.  He took his name Nicholas in memory of his obligations to Niccolò Albergati.  The Pontificate of Nicholas saw the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks, and decrees which effectively sanctioned slavery.  By the Concordat of Vienna he secured the recognition of papal rights over bishoprics and benefices. 

Antipope Nicholas V<====>44995<====>Antipope Nicholas V Nicholas V, born Pietro Rainalducci (c.  1260 16 October 1333) was an antipope in Italy from 12 May 1328 to 25 July 1330 during the pontificate of Pope John XXII (1316–34) at Avignon.  He was the last Imperial antipope that is, one set up by a Holy Roman Emperor. LifeRainalducci was born at Corvaro, an ancient stronghold near Rieti in Lazio.  He joined the Franciscan order after separating from his wife in 1310, and became famous as a preacher.    He was elected through the influence of the excommunicated Holy Roman Emperor, Louis the Bavarian, by an assembly of priests and laymen, and consecrated at Old St. 

Systems analysis<====>45002<====>Systems analysis  The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines system analysis as "the process of studying a procedure or business in order to identify its goals and purposes and create systems and procedures that will achieve them in an efficient way".  Another view sees system analysis as a problem-solving technique that breaks down a system into its component pieces for the purpose of the studying how well those component parts work and interact to accomplish their purpose.  The field of system analysis relates closely to requirements analysis or to operations research.  It is also "an explicit formal inquiry carried out to help a decision maker identify a better course of action and make a better decision than she might otherwise have made.

Petra<====>45008<====>Petra  Petra (Arabic: البتراء, Al-Batrāʾ; Ancient Greek: Πέτρα), originally known as Raqmu (Nabataean Arabic: الرقيم), is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan.  Petra lies on the slope of Jabal Al-Madbah in a basin among the mountains which form the eastern flank of Arabah valley that run from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.  Established possibly as early as the 4th century BC as the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom.  The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub. 

Oil shale<====>45010<====>Oil shaleOil shale is an organic-rich fine-grained sedimentary rock containing kerogen (a solid mixture of organic chemical compounds) from which liquid hydrocarbons, called shale oil (not to be confused with tight oil—crude oil occurring naturally in shales), can be produced.   Shale oil is a substitute for conventional crude oil; however, extracting shale oil from oil shale is more costly than the production of conventional crude oil both financially and in terms of its environmental impact.    Deposits of oil shale occur around the world, including major deposits in the United States.

Natural transformation<====>45022<====>Natural transformation  In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a natural transformation provides a way of transforming one functor into another while respecting the internal structure (i. e. , the composition of morphisms) of the categories involved.  Hence, a natural transformation can be considered to be a "morphism of functors".  Indeed, this intuition can be formalized to define so-called functor categories.  Natural transformations are, after categories and functors, one of the most fundamental notions of category theory and consequently appear in the majority of its applications. DefinitionIf F and G are functors between the categories C and D, then a natural transformation η from F to G is a family of morphisms that satisfies two requirements. 

Mongol invasion of Rus'<====>45028<====>Mongol invasion of Rus'   As part of the Mongol invasion of Europe, the Mongol Empire invaded Kievan Rus' in the 13th century, destroying numerous cities, including Ryazan, Kolomna, Moscow, Vladimir and Kiev.  The campaign was heralded by the Battle of the Kalka River in May 1223, which resulted in a Mongol victory over the forces of several Rus' principalities.  The Mongols nevertheless retreated.  A full-scale invasion of Rus' by Batu Khan followed, from 1237 to 1240.  The invasion was ended by the Mongol succession process upon the death of Ögedei Khan.  All Rus' principalities were forced to submit to Mongol rule and became part of the Golden Horde empire, some of which lasted until 1480. 

Dordogne<====>45032<====>Dordogne  {{Infobox settlement }}Dordogne ( ;  ) is a department in southwestern France, with its prefecture in Périgueux.  The department is located in the region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine between the Loire Valley and the Pyrenees, and is named after the great Dordogne river that runs through it.  It roughly corresponds with the ancient county of Périgord. History The county of Périgord dates back to when the area was inhabited by the Gauls.  It was originally home to four tribes, the name for "four tribes" in the Gaulish language was "Petrocore".  The area eventually became known as the county of Le Périgord and its inhabitants became known as the Périgordins (or Périgourdins). 

Straw man proposal<====>45033<====>Straw man proposal A straw-man proposal is a brainstormed simple draft proposal intended to generate discussion of its disadvantages and to provoke the generation of new and better proposals.  The term is considered American business jargon,    but it is also encountered in engineering office culture. Often, a straw man document will be prepared by one or two people prior to kicking off a larger project.  In this way, the team can jump start their discussions with a document that is likely to contain many, but not all, of the key aspects to be discussed.  As the document is revised, it may be given other edition names such as the more solid-sounding "stone-man", "iron-man", and so on. 

Likelihood-ratio test<====>45035<====>Likelihood-ratio test  In statistics, a likelihood ratio test (LR test) is a statistical test used for comparing the goodness of fit of two statistical models, one of which (the null model) is a special case of the other (the alternative model).  The test is based on the likelihood ratio, which expresses how many times more likely the data are under one model than the other.  This likelihood ratio, or equivalently its logarithm, can then be used to compute a p-value, or compared to a critical value to decide whether or not to reject the null model.  When the logarithm of the likelihood ratio is used, the statistic is known as a log-likelihood ratio statistic, and the probability distribution of this test statistic, assuming that the null model is true, can be approximated using Wilks’ theorem.

Plot summaryHumanity has lived for 40 million years on a planet called Harmony, after leaving an Earth that has been destroyed by human conflict.  In order not to repeat the mistakes that led tothe destruction of civilization on Earth, a computer, known as the Oversoul, was left as guardian of this planet. Its main mission was to prevent humans from developing technologies that could make wars a global affair. 

Shields (Star Trek)<====>45051<====>Shields (Star Trek)DISPLAYTITLE In the Star Trek fictional universe, shields refer to a 23rd and 24th century technology that provides starships, space stations, and entire planets with limited protection against damage.  They are sometimes referred to as deflectors, deflector shields, and screens (the latter during Star Trek: The Original Series). HistoryThe term 'shields' first appears in the Star Trek episode "Balance of Terror", in which they were deployed, albeit to little effect, by a Federation outpost under attack from a Romulan Warbird.   The first depicted use by a starship was in the Star Trek episode "Arena", in which the USS Enterprise raises its 'screens' after being attacked by an alien warship although the term 'shields' is not used in this episode.

Part of speech<====>45059<====>Part of speech In traditional grammar, a part of speech (abbreviated form: PoS or POS) is a category of words (or, more generally, of lexical items) which have similar grammatical properties.  Words that are assigned to the same part of speech generally display similar behavior in terms of syntax—they play similar roles within the grammatical structure of sentences—and sometimes in terms of morphology, in that they undergo inflection for similar propeties.  Commonly listed English parts of speech are noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction, interjection, and sometimes numeral, article or determiner. Essentially all these word classes exist within all Indo-European languages,  even though articles might sometimes be considered as a part of a noun. 

From Hell<====>45061<====>From Hell    {{Infobox graphic novel }}From Hell is a graphic novel by writer Alan Moore and artist Eddie Campbell, originally published in serial form from 1989 to 1998 and collected in 1999.  Set during the Whitechapel murders of the late Victorian era, the novel speculates upon the identity and motives of Jack the Ripper.  The novel depicts several true events of the murders, although portions have been fictionalised, particularly the identity of the killer and the precise nature and circumstances of the murders.  The title is taken from the first words of the "From Hell" letter, which some authorities believe was an authentic message sent from the killer in 1888. 

Abelian category<====>45063<====>Abelian categoryIn mathematics, an abelian category is a category in which morphisms and objects can be added and in which kernels and cokernels exist and have desirable properties.  The motivating prototype example of an abelian category is the category of abelian groups, Ab.  The theory originated in an effort to unify several cohomology theories by Alexander Grothendieck and independently in the slightly earlier work of David Buchsbaum.  Abelian categories are very stable categories, for example they are regular and they satisfy the snake lemma.  The class of Abelian categories is closed under several categorical constructions, for example, the category of chain complexes of an Abelian category, or the category of functors from a small category to an Abelian category are Abelian as well. 

370<====>45064<====>370Year 370 (CCCLXX) was a common year starting on Friday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar.  At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Augustus and Valens (or, less frequently, year 1123 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 370 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

Transnational Radical Party<====>45067<====>Transnational Radical Party The Transnational Radical Party (TRP), whose official name is Nonviolent Radical Party, Transnational and Transparty (NRPTT), is a political association of citizens, members of parliament and members of government of various national and political backgrounds who intend to adopt nonviolent means to create an effective body of international law with respect for individuals, human, civil and political rights, as well as the affirmation of democracy and political freedom in the world. The TRP does not participate in elections, and despite being named "party", is a non-governmental organization (NGO), adept in building synergies among political forces aimed at achieving the goals of its congressional motions. 

Phrase structure rules<====>45068<====>Phrase structure rulesPhrase structure rules are a type of rewrite rule used to describe a given language's syntax and are closely associated with the early stages of transformational grammar, being first proposed by Noam Chomsky in 1957.   They are used to break down a natural language sentence into its constituent parts, also known as syntactic categories, including both lexical categories (parts of speech) and phrasal categories.  A grammar that uses phrase structure rules is a type of phrase structure grammar .  Phrase structure rules as they are commonly employed operate according to the constituency relation, and a grammar that employs phrase structure rules is therefore a constituency grammar; as such, it stands in contrast to dependency grammars, which are based on the dependency relation. 

Semantic property<====>45070<====>Semantic propertySemantic properties or meaning properties are those aspects of a linguistic unit, such as a morpheme, word, or sentence, that contribute to the meaning of that unit.  Basic semantic properties include being meaningful or meaningless – for example, whether a given word is part of a language's lexicon with a generally understood meaning; polysemy, having multiple, typically related, meanings; ambiguity, having meanings which aren't necessarily related ; and anomaly, where the elements of a unit are semantically incompatible with each other, although possibly grammatically sound.  Beyond the expression itself, there are higher-level semantic relations that describe the relationship between units: these include synonymy, antonymy, and hyponymy. 

Semantic class<====>45071<====>Semantic class A semantic class contains words that share a semantic feature.  For example within nouns there are two sub classes, concrete nouns and abstract nouns. The concrete nouns include people, plants, animals, materials and objects while the abstract nouns refer to concepts such as qualities, actions, and processes. According to the nature of the noun, they are categorized into different semantic classes. Semantic classes may intersect. The intersection of female and young can be girl.  See alsoSemantic propertyCategorizationSemantic fieldReferences  DEFAULTSORT 

Semantic feature<====>45072<====>Semantic featureSemantic features represent the basic conceptual components of meaning for any lexical item.   An individual semantic feature constitutes one component of a word's intension, which is the inherent sense or concept evoked.   Linguistic meaning of a word is proposed to arise from contrasts and significant differences with other words.  Semantic features enable linguistics to explain how words that share certain features may be members of the same semantic domain.  Correspondingly, the contrast in meanings of words is explained by diverging semantic features.  For example, father and son share the common components of 'human', 'kinship', 'male' and are thus part of a semantic domain of male family relations.

Giacomo Leopardi<====>45077<====>Giacomo Leopardi   Giacomo Taldegardo Francesco di Sales Saverio Pietro Leopardi ( ; 29 June 1798 – 14 June 1837) was an Italian philosopher, poet, essayist, and philologist.  He is widely seen as one of the most radical and challenging thinkers of the 19th century.    Although he lived in a secluded town in the conservative Papal States, he came in touch with the main ideas of the Enlightenment, and through his own literary evolution, created a remarkable and renowned poetic work, related to the Romantic era.  The strongly lyrical quality of his poetry made him a central figure on the European and international literary and cultural landscape. 

Vasco da Gama<====>45080<====>Vasco da GamaVasco da Gama, 1st Count of Vidigueira ( ; c.  1460s – 24 December 1524), was a Portuguese explorer and the first European to reach India by sea.  His initial voyage to India (1497–1499) was the first to link Europe and Asia by an ocean route, connecting the Atlantic and the Indian oceans and therefore, the West and the Orient. Da Gama's discovery of the sea route to India was significant and opened the way for an age of global imperialism and for the Portuguese to establish a long-lasting colonial empire in Asia. 

The Puppet Masters<====>45081<====>The Puppet Masters   The Puppet Masters is a 1951 science fiction novel by American writer Robert A.  Heinlein, in which American secret agents battle parasitic invaders from outer space.  It was originally serialized in Galaxy Science Fiction (September, October, November 1951). The novel evokes a sense of paranoia later captured in the 1956 film Invasion of the Body Snatchers, which had a similar premise.  Heinlein also repeatedly makes explicit the analogy between the mind-controlling parasites and the Communist Russians, echoing the prevailing Second Red Scare in the United States. SettingThe novel's first scene is set in 2007.

Biodiversity<====>45086<====>Biodiversity Biodiversity, a portmanteau of "bio" (life) and "diversity", generally refers to the   and variability of life on Earth.  According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), biodiversity typically measures variation at the genetic, the species, and the ecosystem level.Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator,  which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity.   Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth, and is richest in the tropics.  These tropical forest ecosystems cover less than 10 percent of earth's surface, and contain about 90 percent of the world's species.

Marsala wine<====>45094<====>Marsala wine Marsala is a wine, dry or sweet, produced in the region surrounding the Italian city of Marsala in Sicily.  Marsala first received Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) status in 1969.    The DOC status is equivalent to PDO: most countries limit the use of the term Marsala to those wines that come from the Marsala area, to which the European Union grants Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status.  While the city's natives sometimes drink "vintage" Marsala, the wine produced for export is universally fortified similar to Port, Madeira and Sherry.  Originally, this addition of  alcohol was to ensure that it would last on long ocean voyages, but now it is made that way because of its popularity in foreign markets.

It is renowned as the site of the ancient Greek city of Akragas (Ἀκράγας; also known as Agrigentum or Acragas in Latin and Kirkent or Jirjent in Arabic), one of the leading cities of Magna Graecia during the golden age of Ancient Greece with population estimates in the range of 200,000 to 800,000 before 406 BC. HistoryAgrigento was founded on a plateau overlooking the sea, with two nearby rivers, the Hypsas and the Akragas, and a ridge to the north offering a degree of natural fortification. 

Lord Voldemort<====>45106<====>Lord Voldemort Lord Voldemort ( ;    HPL: Lord Voldemort: Quick facts  in the films; born Tom Marvolo Riddle) is a fictional character and the main antagonist in J.  K.  Rowling's series of Harry Potter novels.  Voldemort first appeared in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, which was released in 1997.  Voldemort appears either in person or in flashbacks in each book and its film adaptation in the series, except the third, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, where he is only mentioned. 

Madeira wine<====>45107<====>Madeira wine Madeira is a fortified wine made in the Portuguese Madeira Islands, off the coast of Africa.  Madeira is produced in a variety of styles ranging from dry wines which can be consumed on their own as an aperitif to sweet wines usually consumed with dessert.  Cheaper cooking versions are often flavoured with salt and pepper for use in cooking, but these are not fit for consumption as a beverage. The islands of Madeira have a long winemaking history, dating back to the Age of Exploration (approximately from the end of the 15th century) when Madeira was a standard port of call for ships heading to the New World or East Indies. 

Marie Antoinette<====>45109<====>Marie Antoinette    Marie Antoinette ( ;   ; born Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna; 2 November 1755 – 16 October 1793) was the last Queen of France before the French Revolution.  She was born an Archduchess of Austria, and was the penultimate child of Empress Maria Theresa and Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor. In April 1770, upon her marriage to Louis-Auguste, heir apparent to the French throne, she became Dauphine of France.  On 10 May 1774, when her husband ascended the throne as Louis XVI, she assumed the title Queen of France and Navarre, which she held until September 1791, when, as the French Revolution proceeded, she became Queen of the French, a title she held until 21 September 1792.

Lunokhod programme<====>45114<====>Lunokhod programme Lunokhod ( , "Moonwalker") was a series of Soviet robotic  lunar rovers designed to land on the Moon between 1969 and 1977.  Lunokhod 1 was the first roving remote-controlled robot to land on another world. The 1969 Lunokhod 1A (Lunokhod 0, Lunokhod No.  201) was destroyed during launch, the 1970 Lunokhod 1 and the 1973 Lunokhod 2 landed on the moon, and Lunokhod 3 (Lunokhod No.  205, planned for 1977) was never launched.  The successful missions were in operation concurrently with the Zond and Luna series of Moon flyby, orbiter and landing missions. The Lunokhods were primarily designed to support the Soviet manned moon missions during the Moon race. 

Lunokhod 1<====>45116<====>Lunokhod 1  Lunokhod 1 (Луноход, moon walker in Russian; Аппарат 8ЕЛ № 203, vehicle 8ЕЛ№203) was the first of two unmanned lunar rovers landed on the Moon by the Soviet Union as part of its Lunokhod program.  The Luna 17 spacecraft carried Lunokhod 1 to the Moon in 1970.  Lunokhod 1 was the first remote-controlled robot "rover" to freely move across the surface of an astronomical object beyond the Earth.  Lunokhod 0 (No. 201), the previous and first attempt to do so, launched in February 1969 but failed to reach orbit. Rover descriptionLunokhod 1 was a lunar vehicle formed of a tub-like compartment with a large convex lid on eight independently powered wheels. 

Lunokhod 2<====>45119<====>Lunokhod 2  Lunokhod 2 ( , moon walker) was the second of two unmanned lunar rovers landed on the Moon by the Soviet Union as part of the Lunokhod programme. The Luna 21 spacecraft landed on the Moon and deployed the second Soviet lunar rover, Lunokhod 2, in January 1973.The primary objectives of the mission were to collect images of the lunar surface, examine ambient light levels to determine the feasibility of astronomical observations from the Moon, perform laser ranging experiments from Earth, observe solar X-rays, measure local magnetic fields, and study the soil mechanics of the lunar surface material. 

Alans<====>45121<====>Alans  The Alans (or Alani) were an Iranian nomadic pastoral people of antiquity. The name Alan is an Iranian dialectical form of Aryan, a common self-designation of the Indo-Iranians.   Possibly related to the Massagetae, the Alans have been connected by modern historians with the Central Asian Yancai and Aorsi of Chinese and Roman sources, respectively.Having migrated westwards and become dominant among the Sarmatians on the Pontic Steppe, they are mentioned by Roman sources in the 1st century AD. 

Anne of the Thousand Days<====>45126<====>Anne of the Thousand Days   Anne of the Thousand Days is a 1969 British costume drama made by Hal Wallis Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures.  It was directed by Charles Jarrott and produced by Hal B.  Wallis.  The film tells the story of Anne Boleyn.  The screenplay is an adaptation by Bridget Boland, John Hale and Richard Sokolove of the 1948 play by Maxwell Anderson.   Anderson employed blank verse for parts of his play, but most examples of this were removed from the screenplay.  One blank verse episode that was retained was Anne's soliloquy in the Tower of London. 

Moors<====>45127<====>Moors  The term "Moors" refers primarily to the Muslim inhabitants of the Maghreb, the Iberian Peninsula, Sicily, and Malta during the Middle Ages.  The Moors initially were the Berber autochthones of the Maghreb.   The name was later also applied to Arabs.   Moors are not a distinct or self-defined people,  and the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica observed that "The term 'Moors' has no real ethnological value. "  Medieval and early modern Europeans variously applied the name to Arabs, North African Berbers, and Muslim Europeans.  The term has also been used in Europe in a broader, somewhat derogatory sense to refer to Muslims in general, Menocal, María Rosa (2002).

Truth condition<====>45132<====>Truth condition In semantics, truth conditions are that which obtain precisely when a sentence is  .  For example, "It is snowing in Nebraska" is true precisely when it is snowing in Nebraska. More formally, we can think of a truth condition as what makes for the truth of a sentence in an inductive definition of truth (for details, see the semantic theory of truth).  Understood this way, truth conditions are theoretical entities.  To illustrate with an example: suppose that, in a particular truth theory, the word "Nixon" refers to Richard M.  Nixon, and "is alive" is associated with the set of currently living things. 

The Wind in the Willows<====>45133<====>The Wind in the Willows    The Wind in the Willows is a children's novel by Kenneth Grahame, first published in 1908.  Alternately slow moving and fast-paced, it focuses on four anthropomorphised animals in a pastoral version of Edwardian England.  The novel is notable for its mixture of mysticism, adventure, morality and camaraderie, and celebrated for its evocation of the nature of the Thames Valley. In 1908, Grahame retired from his position as secretary of the Bank of England.  He moved back to Berkshire, where he had lived as a child, and spent his time by the River Thames doing much as the animal characters in his book do – as the book says, "simply messing about in boats" – and expanding the bedtime stories he had earlier told his son Alastair into a manuscript for the book. 

Discourse<====>45134<====>Discourse  Discourse (from Latin discursus, "running to and from") denotes written and spoken communications:In semantics and discourse analysis: Discourse is a conceptual generalization of conversation within each modality and context of communication. The totality of codified language (vocabulary) used in a given field of intellectual enquiry and of social practice, such as legal discourse, medical discourse, religious discourse, et cetera.  In the work of Michel Foucault, and that of the social theoreticians he inspired: discourse describes "an entity of sequences, of signs, in that they are enouncements (énoncés)", statements in conversation.    As discourse, an enouncement (statement) is not a unit of semiotic signs, but an abstract construct that allows the semiotic signs to assign meaning, and so communicate specific, repeatable communications to, between, and among objects, subjects, and statements. 

Georg Major<====>45138<====>Georg Major George Major  (April 25, 1502 – November 28, 1574) was a Lutheran  theologian of the Protestant Reformation.  He was born in Nuremberg and died at Wittenberg. LifeAt the age of nine Major was sent to Wittenberg, and in 1521 entered the  university there.  When Cruciger returned to  Wittenberg in 1529, Major was appointed rector of the Johannisschule in Magdeburg, but in 1537 he  became court preacher at Wittenberg and was  ordained by Martin Luther. In 1545 he was made professor in the theological faculty, in which his authority increased to such an extent that in the following year the elector sent him to the  Conference of Regensburg, where he was soon captivated by the personality of Butzer. 

Chennai<====>45139<====>Chennai Chennai ( ; formerly known as Madras   or   ) is the capital of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.  Located on the Coromandel Coast off the Bay of Bengal, it is one of the biggest cultural, economic and educational centres in South India.  According to the 2011 Indian census, it is the fifth-largest city and fourth-most populous urban agglomeration in India.  The city together with the adjoining regions constitute the Chennai Metropolitan Area, which is the 36th-largest urban area by population in the world.   Chennai is among the most visited Indian cities by foreign tourists. 

Shavian alphabet<====>45144<====>Shavian alphabet  The Shavian alphabet (also known as the Shaw alphabet) is an alphabet conceived as a way to provide simple, phonetic orthography for the English language to replace the difficulties of conventional spelling.  It was posthumously funded by and named after Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw.  Shaw set three main criteria for the new alphabet: it should be (1) at least 40 letters; (2) as "phonetic" as possible (that is, letters should have a 1:1 correspondence to phonemes); and (3) distinct from the Latin alphabet to avoid the impression that the new spellings were simply "misspellings". 

Hubble sequence<====>45145<====>Hubble sequenceThe Hubble sequence is a morphological classification scheme for galaxies invented by Edwin Hubble in 1926.  It is often known colloquially as the Hubble tuning fork diagram because of the shape in which it is traditionally represented. Hubble’s scheme divides regular galaxies into 3 broad classes – ellipticals, lenticulars and spirals – based on their visual appearance (originally on photographic plates).  A fourth class contains galaxies with an irregular appearance.  To this day, the Hubble sequence is the most commonly used system for classifying galaxies, both in professional astronomical research and in amateur astronomy. 

CP/M<====>45146<====>CP/M   CP/M, originally standing for Control Program/Monitor and later Control Program for Microcomputers,    is a mass-market operating system created for Intel 8080/85-based microcomputers by Gary Kildall of Digital Research, Inc.  Initially confined to single-tasking on 8-bit processors and no more than 64 kilobytes of memory, later versions of CP/M added multi-user variations and were migrated to 16-bit processors. The combination of CP/M and S-100 bus computers was loosely patterned on the MITS Altair, an early standard in the microcomputer industry.  This computer platform was widely used in business through the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s. 

8-bit<====>45148<====>8-bit    8-bit is also a generation of microcomputers in which 8-bit microprocessors were the norm. The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses.   Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time.  The first widely adopted 8-bit microprocessor was the Intel 8080, being used in many hobbyist computers of the late 1970s and early 1980s, often running the CP/M operating system; it had 8-bit data words and 16-bit addresses. 

Elián González<====>45154<====>Elián González Elián González (born December 6, 1993) is a Cuban national who, as a young boy in 2000, became embroiled in a heated international custody and immigration controversy involving the governments of Cuba and the United States; his father, Juan Miguel González Quintana; his other relatives in Cuba and in Miami, Florida; and Miami's Cuban American community. González's mother, Elizabeth Brotons Rodríguez, drowned in November 1999 while attempting to leave Cuba with González and her boyfriend to get to the United States.    The U. S.  Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) initially placed González with paternal relatives in Miami, who sought to keep him in the United States against his father's demands that González be returned to Cuba. 

Tatian<====>45158<====>Tatian Tatian of Adiabene,    or Tatian the Syrian,    Tatian the Assyrian,    ( ;  ;  ;  ; c.  120 – c.  180 AD) was a Syrian Christian writer and theologian of the 2nd century. Tatian's most influential work is the Diatessaron, a Biblical paraphrase, or "harmony", of the four gospels that became the standard text of the four gospels in the Syriac-speaking churches until the 5th-century, after which it gave way to the four separate gospels in the Peshitta version.  LifeConcerning the date and place of his birth, little is known beyond what Tatian tells about himself in his Oratio ad Graecos, chap. 

Olivine<====>45159<====>Olivine   The mineral olivine ( ) is a magnesium iron silicate with the formula (Mg 2+ , Fe 2+ ) 2 SiO 4 .  Thus it is a type of nesosilicate or orthosilicate.  It is a common mineral in the Earth's subsurface but weathers quickly on the surface. The ratio of magnesium and iron varies between the two endmembers of the solid solution series: forsterite (Mg-endmember: Mg 2 SiO 4 ) and fayalite (Fe-endmember: Fe 2 SiO 4 ).  Compositions of olivine are commonly expressed as molar percentages of forsterite (Fo) and fayalite (Fa) (e. 

Peridot<====>45162<====>Peridot   Peridot (  or  ) is gem-quality olivine, which is a silicate mineral with the formula of (Mg, Fe) 2 SiO 4 .  As peridot is the magnesium-rich variety of olivine (forsterite), the formula approaches Mg 2 SiO 4 . EtymologyThe origin of the name peridot is uncertain.  The Oxford English Dictionary suggests an alteration of Anglo–Norman pedoretés (classical Latin pæderot-), a kind of opal, rather than the Arabic word faridat, meaning "gem". The Middle English Dictionary's entry on peridot includes several variations : peridod, peritot, pelidod and pilidod – other variants substitute y for the is seen here. 

Speech organ<====>45163<====>Speech organ Speech organs or articulators, produce the sounds of language.   Organs used for speech include the lips, teeth, alveolar ridge, hard palate, velum (soft palate), uvula, glottis and various parts of the tongue.  They can be divided into two types: passive articulators and active articulators.  Active articulators move relative to passive articulators, which remain still, to produce various speech sounds, in particular manners of articulation.   The upper lip, teeth, alveolar ridge, hard palate, soft palate, uvula, and pharynx wall are passive articulators.  The most important active articulator is the tongue as it is involved in the production of the majority of sounds. 

Orthoclase<====>45165<====>Orthoclase Orthoclase, or orthoclase feldspar (endmember formula KAlSi 3 O 8 ), is an important tectosilicate mineral which forms igneous rock.  The name is from the Ancient Greek for "straight fracture," because its two cleavage planes are at right angles to each other.  It is a type of potassium feldspar, also known as K-feldspar.  The gem known as moonstone (see below) is largely composed of orthoclase. Formation and subtypesOrthoclase is a common constituent of most granites and other felsic igneous rocks and often forms huge crystals and masses in pegmatite. Typically, the pure potassium endmember of orthoclase forms a solid solution with albite, the sodium endmember (NaAlSi 3 O 8 ), of plagioclase. 

Microcline<====>45166<====>MicroclineMicrocline  Crystal system:  Triclinic Category:  Tectosilicate Color in PPL:  Colorless Pleochroism:  N/A Habit/Shape:  Can be anhedral or euhedral.  Grains are commonly elongate with a tabular appearance.  May contain lamellae which formed from exsolved albite.  Relief:  Low negative relief Cleavage/Fracture Habit:  Has perfect cleavage parallel to {001} and good cleavage on {010}.  Cleavages intersect at 90°41'.  It can be difficult to see cleavage in thin section due to microcline's low relief.  Twinning:  Typically displays albite twinning and pericline twinning.  This combination leads to a grid pattern, hence microcline displays gridiron twinning. 

Anorthoclase<====>45167<====>Anorthoclase The mineral anorthoclase ((Na,K)AlSi 3 O 8 ) is a crystalline solid solution in the alkali feldspar series, in which the sodium-aluminium silicate member exists in larger proportion.  It typically consists of between 10 and 36 percent of KAlSi 3 O 8  and between 64 and 90 percent of NaAlSi 3 O 8 .  Structure and stabilityAnorthoclase is an intermediate member of the high albite – sanidine alkali feldspar solid solution series.  Intermediate members of this series, high albite, anorthoclase and high sodium sanidine are stable at temperatures of   and above.  Below 400 to 600 °C only very limited solution exists (less than about 5% on both the low albite and microcline ends). 

Plagioclase<====>45168<====>Plagioclase Plagioclase is a series of tectosilicate (framework silicate) minerals within the feldspar group.  Rather than referring to a particular mineral with a specific chemical composition, plagioclase is a continuous solid solution series, more properly known as the plagioclase feldspar series (from the Ancient Greek for "oblique fracture", in reference to its two cleavage angles).   This was first shown by the German mineralogist Johann Friedrich Christian Hessel (1796–1872) in 1826.   The series ranges from albite to anorthite endmembers (with respective compositions NaAlSi 3 O 8  to CaAl 2 Si 2 O 8 ), where sodium and calcium atoms can substitute for each other in the mineral's crystal lattice structure. 

The Godfather (novel)<====>45169<====>The Godfather (novel) The Godfather is a crime novel written by Italian American author Mario Puzo.  Originally published in 1969 by G.  P.  Putnam's Sons, the novel details the story of a fictional Mafia family based in New York City (and Long Beach, New York), headed by Vito Corleone.  The novel covers the years 1945 to 1955, and also provides the back story of Vito Corleone from early childhood to adulthood. The book is noteworthy for introducing Italian criminal terms like consigliere, caporegime, Cosa Nostra, and omertà to an English-speaking audience. It inspired a 1972 film of the same name. 

Elvish languages (Middle-earth)<====>45170<====>Elvish languages (Middle-earth)For Elvish languages in general, see Elvish languages. J.  R.  R.  Tolkien constructed many Elvish languages.  These were the languages spoken by the tribes of his Elves.  Tolkien was a philologist by profession, and spent much time on his constructed languages.  The Elvish languages were the first thing he imagined for his secondary world.  Tolkien said that his stories grew out of his languages.  Tolkien also created scripts for his Elvish languages, of which the best known are the Sarati, the Tengwar, and the Cirth. External historyJ.  R.  R. 

Carabinieri<====>45173<====>Carabinieri  The Carabinieri (formally Arma dei Carabinieri, "Carabinieri Force" or previously Corpo dei Carabinieri Reali, "Royal Carabinieri Corps"; ) is the fourth Italian military force charged with police duties under the authority of the Ministry of Defense.  Carabinieri are the national gendarmerie of Italy, policing both military and civilian populations.  Carabinieri (similar to Polizia di Stato and Guardia di Finanza) are always "on duty" throughout the national territory including out of service hours, during leave and whilst on vacation, and they are always permitted to carry their assigned weapon as personal equipment (Beretta 92FS pistol). 

Negative binomial distribution<====>45177<====>Negative binomial distribution In probability theory and statistics, the negative binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials before a specified (non-random) number of failures (denoted r) occurs.  For example, if we define a 1 as failure, all non-1s as successes, and we throw a dice repeatedly until the third time 1 appears (r = three failures), then the probability distribution of the number of non-1s that had appeared will be a negative binomial. The Pascal distribution (after Blaise Pascal) and Polya distribution (for George Pólya) are special cases of the negative binomial. 

Process (computing)<====>45178<====>Process (computing)In computing, a process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed.  It contains the program code and its current activity.  Depending on the operating system (OS), a process may be made up of multiple threads of execution that execute instructions concurrently.  A computer program is a passive collection of instructions, while a process is the actual execution of those instructions.  Several processes may be associated with the same program; for example, opening up several instances of the same program often means more than one process is being executed. 

Clara Schumann<====>45181<====>Clara Schumann  Clara Schumann (née Clara Josephine Wieck; 13 September 1819 – 20 May 1896) was a German musician and composer, considered one of the most distinguished pianists of the Romantic era.   "Women of Historic Note".  Washington Post, By Gayle Worl March 9, 1997   She exerted her influence over a 61-year concert career, changing the format and repertoire of the piano recital and the tastes of the listening public.   Her husband was the composer Robert Schumann.   Together they encouraged Johannes Brahms.  She was the first to perform publicly any work by Brahms. 

Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award<====>45182<====>Irving G.  Thalberg Memorial AwardThe Irving G.  Thalberg Memorial Award is awarded periodically by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences at the Governors Awards ceremonies to "Creative producers, whose bodies of work reflect a consistently high quality of motion picture production. " The award is named for Irving Thalberg, legendary head of the Production Division of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, who developed the company's reputation for sophisticated films.  The trophy itself is a bust of Thalberg rather than the familiar "Oscar" statuette.   However, it is still counted as an "honorary Oscar".  The award was established in 1937 and was first presented at the 10th Academy Awards, in March 1938. 

Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award<====>45184<====>Jean Hersholt Humanitarian AwardThe Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award is awarded periodically by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) at the Governors Awards ceremonies for an individual's outstanding contributions to humanitarian causes.  The award category was instituted in 1956 and first awarded at the 29th Academy Awards, in March 1957.  Unlike the Academy Award of Merit, the nomination and voting for this award are restricted to members of the Board of Governors of AMPAS.    HistoryThe award is named after Danish American screen actor and humanitarian Jean Hersholt (1886–1956), who served as president of the Motion Picture Relief Fund for 18 years.

Paul Muni<====>45188<====>Paul Muni   Paul Muni (born Frederich Meshilem Meier Weisenfreund; September 22, 1895 – August 25, 1967) was an American stage and film actor who grew up in Chicago.  Muni was a five-time Academy Award nominee, with one win.  He started his acting career in the Yiddish theatre.  During the 1930s, he was considered one of the most prestigious actors at the Warner Bros.  studio, and was given the rare privilege of choosing which parts he wanted. His acting quality, usually playing a powerful character, such as the lead in Scarface (1932), was partly a result of his intense preparation for his parts, often immersing himself in study of the real character's traits and mannerisms. 

Brandy<====>45189<====>Brandy  Brandy is a spirit produced by distilling wine.  Brandy generally contains 35–60% alcohol by volume (70–120 US proof) and is typically drunk as an after-dinner digestif.  Some brandies are aged in wooden casks, others are coloured with caramel colouring to imitate the effect of aging, and some are produced using a combination of both aging and colouring.  Varieties of wine brandy can be found across the winemaking world.  Among the most renowned are Cognac and Armagnac from southwestern France.In a broader sense, the term "brandy" also denotes liquors obtained from the distillation of pomace (yielding pomace brandy) or mash or wine of any other fruit (fruit brandy). 

Carl Maria von Weber<====>45190<====>Carl Maria von Weber  Carl Maria Friedrich Ernst von Weber (18 or 19 November 1786  5 June 1826)   was a German composer, conductor, pianist, guitarist  and critic, and was one of the first significant composers of the Romantic school. Weber's operas Der Freischütz, Euryanthe and Oberon greatly influenced the development of the Romantische Oper (Romantic opera) in Germany.  Der Freischütz came to be regarded as the first German "nationalist" opera, Euryanthe developed the Leitmotif technique to an unprecedented degree, while Oberon may have influenced Mendelssohn's music for A Midsummer Night's Dream and, at the same time, revealed Weber's lifelong interest in the music of non-Western cultures.

Lp space<====>45194<====>Lp spaceDISPLAYTITLEIn mathematics, the L p  spaces are function spaces defined using a natural generalization of the p-norm for finite-dimensional vector spaces.  They are sometimes called Lebesgue spaces, named after Henri Lebesgue  , although according to the Bourbaki group   they were first introduced by Frigyes Riesz  . L p  spaces form an important class of Banach spaces in functional analysis, and of topological vector spaces. Because of their key role in the mathematical analysis of measure and probability spaces, Lebesgue spaces are used also in the theoretical discussion of problems in physics, statistics, finance, engineering, and other disciplines. 

Injective function<====>45196<====>Injective function  In mathematics, an injective function or injection or one-to-one function is a function that preserves distinctness: it never maps distinct elements of its domain to the same element of its codomain.  In other words, every element of the function's codomain is the image of at most one element of its domain.  The term one-to-one function must not be confused with one-to-one correspondence (a. k. a.   bijective function), which uniquely maps all elements in both domain and codomain to each other (see figures).  Occasionally, an injective function from X to Y is denoted  , using an arrow with a barbed tail ( ). 

Inverse element<====>45199<====>Inverse element In abstract algebra, the idea of an inverse element generalises concepts of a negation (sign reversal) in relation to addition, and a reciprocal in relation to multiplication.  The intuition is of an element that can 'undo' the effect of combination with another given element.  While the precise definition of an inverse element varies depending on the algebraic structure involved, these definitions coincide in a group. The word 'inverse' is derived from   that means 'turned upside down', 'overturned'. Formal definitionsIn a unital magmaLet  S  be a set closed under a binary operation  *  (i. 

Universal algebra<====>45200<====>Universal algebraUniversal algebra (sometimes called general algebra) is the field of mathematics that studies algebraic structures themselves, not examples ("models") of algebraic structures. For instance, rather than take particular groups as the object of study, in universal algebra one takes the class of groups as an object of study. Basic ideaIn universal algebra, an algebra (or algebraic structure) is a set A together with a collection of operations on A.   An n-ary operation on A is a function that takes n elements of A and returns a single element of A.   Thus, a 0-ary operation (or nullary operation) can be represented simply as an element of A, or a constant, often denoted by a letter like a. 

371<====>45203<====>371Year 371 (CCCLXXI) was a common year starting on Saturday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar.  At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Augustus and Petronius (or, less frequently, year 1124 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 371 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placeRoman EmpireThe fortified cities of the Danube, with Sirmium (Pannonia) at the forefront, contribute to stop an invasion of the Quadi. 

372<====>45204<====>372Year 372 (CCCLXXII) was a leap year starting on Sunday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar.  At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Modestus and Arintheus (or, less frequently, year 1125 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 372 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placeRoman EmpireEmperor Valentinian I is engaged in operations against the Alamanni, Quadi and  Sarmatians, while his subordinates are dealing with Firmus,  Roman usurper, in Africa and the Picts in Britain. 

Submarine communications cable<====>45206<====>Submarine communications cableA submarine communications cable is a cable laid on the sea bed between land-based stations to carry telecommunication signals across stretches of ocean and sea.   The first submarine communications cables, laid in the 1850s, carried telegraphy traffic.   Subsequent generations of cables carried telephone traffic, then data communications traffic.   Modern cables use optical fiber technology to carry digital data, which includes telephone, Internet and private data traffic. Modern cables are typically about 1 inch (25 mm) in diameter and weigh around 2. 5 tons per mile (1. 4 tonnes per km) for the deep-sea sections which comprise the majority of the run, although larger and heavier cables are used for shallow-water sections near shore. 

Communications satellite<====>45207<====>Communications satelliteA communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunications signals via a transponder; it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth.  Communications satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications.  There are over 2,000 communications satellites in Earth’s orbit, used by both private and government organizations.  Wireless communication uses electromagnetic waves to carry signals.  These waves require line-of-sight, and are thus obstructed by the curvature of the Earth.   The purpose of communications satellites is to relay the signal around the curve of the Earth allowing communication between widely separated points.

Belarusian language<====>45213<====>Belarusian language Belarusian ( ;  ) is an official language of Belarus, along with Russian, and is spoken abroad, mainly in Ukraine and Russia.  Before Belarus gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the language was only known in English as Byelorussian or Belorussian, transliterating the Russian name,  , or alternatively as White Ruthenian ( ) or White Russian.  Following independence, it has acquired the additional name Belarusian.Belarusian is one of the East Slavic languages and shares many grammatical and lexical features with other members of the group. 

Ali G<====>45214<====>Ali G   Alistair Leslie Graham, better known as Ali G, is a satirical fictional character created and performed by British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen.  Originally appearing on Channel 4's The 11 O'Clock Show, and subsequently as the title character of Channel 4's Da Ali G Show in 2000 and on HBO in 2003–2004, he is also the title character of the film Ali G Indahouse.  In December 2007, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, Baron Cohen announced that Ali G, along with Borat, had been retired.However, Ali G returned at the 2012 British Comedy Awards to accept Baron Cohen's Outstanding Achievement Award, causing controversy by making jokes about Kate Middleton and Jimmy Savile. 

Meliaceae<====>45216<====>Meliaceae Meliaceae, or the mahogany family, is a flowering plant family of mostly trees and shrubs (and a few herbaceous plants, mangroves) in the order Sapindales. They are characterised by alternate, usually pinnate leaves without stipules, and by syncarpous,  apparently bisexual (but actually mostly cryptically unisexual) flowers borne in panicles, cymes, spikes, or clusters.  Most species are evergreen, but some are deciduous, either in the dry season or in winter. The family includes about 53 genera and about 600 known species,    with a pantropical distribution; one genus (Toona) extends north into temperate China and south into southeast Australia, and another (Melia) nearly as far north. 

Sacha Baron Cohen<====>45218<====>Sacha Baron CohenSacha Noam Baron Cohen    (born 13 October 1971) is an English actor, comedian, screenwriter, and producer.  Baron Cohen is most widely known for creating and portraying four fictional characters: Ali G, Borat Sagdiyev, Brüno Gehard, and Admiral General Aladeen.  Like his idol Peter Sellers, he uses a variety of accents and guises for his characters.  In most of his routines, Baron Cohen's characters interact with unsuspecting people, docu style, who do not realise they are being set up for comic situations and self-revealing ridicule.  His other work includes voicing King Julien XIII in the Madagascar film series (2005–2012) and appearing in Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), Hugo (2011) and Les Misérables (2012). 

Staines-upon-Thames<====>45220<====>Staines-upon-Thames   Staines-upon-Thames is a town on the River Thames in Surrey, England. Historically part of Middlesex, it was known to the Romans as Pontes or Ad Pontes, then as Stanes and subsequently Staines. The town is within the western bounds of the M25 motorway, 17 miles (27 km) south-west of Charing Cross.  It is within the London Commuter Belt, Greater London Urban Area and adjoins part of the Green Belt.  Passing along the edge of the town and crossing Staines Bridge is the Thames Path National Trail. Parts of the large Staines upon Thames post town are whole villages: Laleham, Stanwell and Wraysbury.

Sitting at the gateway between the Thames Valley and London and at the intersection of the M4, M40 and M25 motorways, it offers easy road access to the rest of the UK. The A4 and the Great Western Main Line pass through the town, which was historically part of neighbouring Buckinghamshire. 

Jean-Michel Jarre<====>45222<====>Jean-Michel Jarre   Jean-Michel André Jarre ( , born 24 August 1948, is a French composer, performer, and record producer.  He is a pioneer in the electronic, ambient and new-age genres, and known for organising outdoor spectacles featuring his music, vast laser displays and fireworks. Jarre was raised in Lyon by his mother and grandparents, and trained on the piano.  From an early age, he was introduced to a variety of art forms, including street performers, jazz musicians and the artist Pierre Soulages.  He played guitar in a band, but his musical style was perhaps most heavily influenced by Pierre Schaeffer, a pioneer of musique concrète at the Groupe de Recherches Musicales. 

Animal Crackers (1930 film)<====>45224<====>Animal Crackers (1930 film)  Animal Crackers is a 1930 Pre-Code Marx Brothers comedy film, in which mayhem and zaniness ensue when a valuable painting goes missing during a party in honor of famed African explorer Captain Jeffrey T.  Spaulding.  A critical and commercial success on its initial release, filming took place at Paramount's  Astoria Studios in Astoria, Queens; it was the second of two films the Brothers would make in New York City. The film stars the Four Marx Brothers, Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo, with Lillian Roth and Margaret Dumont.  It was directed by Victor Heerman and adapted from a successful 1928 Broadway musical of the same title by George S. 

The Hunting of the Snark<====>45227<====>The Hunting of the Snark    The Hunting of the Snark (An Agony in 8 Fits) is a poem written by English writer Lewis Carroll.  It is typically categorised  as a nonsense poem.  Written from 1874 to 1876, the poem borrows the setting, some creatures, and eight portmanteau words from Carroll's earlier poem "Jabberwocky" in his children's novel Through the Looking Glass (1871). Henry Holiday, the illustrator of the poem, thought of it as a "tragedy".  The plot follows a crew of ten trying to hunt the Snark, an animal which may turn out to be a highly dangerous Boojum.

He is one of the most prolific character actors in film history, having completed approximately 170 films since 1967.  He received critical acclaim for his performances in The Last Metro (1980), for which he won the César Award for Best Actor, in Police (1985), for which he won the Venice Film Festival Award for Best Actor, Jean de Florette (1986), and Cyrano de Bergerac (1990), winning the Cannes Film Festival for Best Actor, his second César Award for Best Actor, and his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. 

Subalgebra<====>45239<====>SubalgebraIn mathematics, a subalgebra is a subset of an algebra, closed under all its operations, and carrying the induced operations. "Algebra", when referring to a structure, often means a vector space or module equipped with an additional bilinear operation.  Algebras in universal algebra are far more general: they are a common generalisation of all algebraic structures.  Subalgebra can be a subset of both cases. Subalgebras for algebras over a ring or fieldA subalgebra of an algebra over a commutative ring or field is a vector subspace which is closed under the multiplication of vectors.  The restriction of the algebra multiplication makes it an algebra over the same ring or field. 

Kernel (algebra)<====>45240<====>Kernel (algebra)In the various branches of mathematics that fall under the heading of abstract algebra, the kernel of a homomorphism measures the degree to which the homomorphism fails to be injective.   An important special case is the kernel of a linear map.  The kernel of a matrix, also called the null space, is the kernel of the linear map defined by the matrix. The definition of kernel takes various forms in various contexts.  But in all of them, the kernel of a homomorphism is trivial (in a sense relevant to that context) if and only if the homomorphism is injective. 

Isomorphism theorems<====>45241<====>Isomorphism theoremsIn mathematics, specifically abstract algebra, the isomorphism theorems are three theorems that describe the relationship between quotients, homomorphisms, and subobjects.   Versions of the theorems exist for groups, rings, vector spaces, modules, Lie algebras, and various other algebraic structures.   In universal algebra, the isomorphism theorems can be generalized to the context of algebras and congruences. HistoryThe isomorphism theorems were formulated in some generality for homomorphisms of modules by Emmy Noether in her paper Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenkörpern which was published in 1927 in Mathematische Annalen.   Less general versions of these theorems can be found in work of Richard Dedekind and previous papers by Noether. 

Reds (film)<====>45242<====>Reds (film)   Reds is a 1981 American epic drama film co-written, produced, and directed by Warren Beatty.  The picture centers on the life and career of John Reed, the journalist and writer who chronicled the Russian Revolution in his book Ten Days That Shook the World.  Beatty stars in the lead role alongside Diane Keaton as Louise Bryant and Jack Nicholson as Eugene O'Neill. The supporting cast includes Edward Herrmann, Jerzy Kosinski, Paul Sorvino, Maureen Stapleton, Gene Hackman, Ramon Bieri, Nicolas Coster, and M.  Emmet Walsh.  The film also features, as "witnesses," interviews with the 98-year-old radical educator and peace activist Scott Nearing, author Dorothy Frooks, reporter and author George Seldes, civil liberties advocate Roger Baldwin, and the American writer Henry Miller, among others. 

Chacmool<====>45243<====>ChacmoolChacmool (also spelled chac-mool) is the term used to refer to a particular form of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican sculpture depicting a reclining figure with its head facing 90 degrees from the front, supporting itself on its elbows and supporting a bowl or a disk upon its stomach.  These figures possibly symbolised slain warriors carrying offerings to the gods; the bowl upon the chest was used to hold sacrificial offerings, including pulque, tamales, tortillas, tobacco, turkeys, feathers and incense.  In an Aztec example the receptacle is a cuauhxicalli (a stone bowl to receive sacrificed human hearts).   Chacmools were often associated with sacrificial stones or thrones. 

Korn<====>45246<====>KornKorn (stylized as KoЯn) is an American nu metal band from Bakersfield, California, formed in 1993. The band's current lineup includes founding members James "Munky" Shaffer (rhythm guitar), Reginald "Fieldy" Arvizu (bass), Brian "Head" Welch (lead guitar, backing vocals), and Jonathan Davis (lead vocals, bagpipes), with the addition of Ray Luzier (drums), who replaced the band's original member, David Silveria in 2007.  Korn was formed by three of the members of the band L. A. P. D. Korn made a demo tape, Neidermayer's Mind, in 1993, which was distributed free to record companies and on request to members of the public. 

User interface<====>45249<====>User interface The user interface (UI), in the industrial design field of human–computer interaction, is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur.  The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' decision-making process.  Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls, and process controls.  The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or involve such disciplines as ergonomics and psychology. 

The Annotated Alice<====>45250<====>The Annotated Alice  The Annotated Alice is a work by Martin Gardner incorporating the text of Lewis Carroll's major tales, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, as well as the original illustrations by John Tenniel.  It has extensive annotations explaining the contemporary references (including the Victorian poems that Carroll parodies), mathematical concepts, word play, and Victorian traditions (such as the snap-dragons) featured in the two books. HistoryThe original book was first published in 1960.   It has been reprinted several times and translated into French, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, German and Hebrew. In 1990, a sequel, More Annotated Alice, was published.

Clear and present danger<====>45254<====>Clear and present danger Clear and present danger was a doctrine adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States to determine under what circumstances limits can be placed on First Amendment freedoms of speech, press, or assembly. History Before the 20th century, most free speech issues involved prior restraint.   Starting in the early 1900s, the Supreme Court began to consider cases in which persons were punished 'after'  speaking or publishing.   The primary legal test used in the United States to determine if speech could be criminalized was the  bad tendency test.  Rabban, pp 132–134, 190–199.

Biosafety<====>45259<====>Biosafety  Biosafety is the prevention of large-scale loss of biological integrity, focusing both on ecology and human health.  These prevention mechanisms include conduction of regular reviews of the biosafety in laboratory settings, as well as strict guidelines to follow.  Biosafety is used to protect from harmful incidents.  Many laboratories handling biohazards employ an ongoing risk management assessment and enforcement process for biosafety.   Failures to follow such protocols can lead to increased risk of exposure to biohazards or pathogens.   (citation) Human error and poor technique contribute to unnecessary exposure and compromise the best safeguards set into place for protection. 

Safe trade<====>45260<====>Safe trade Safe trade is a slogan advocated by Greenpeace in its desire to "green" the World Trade Organisation and the Doha Development Round.   It is designed to compete with "free trade" as a concept. Safe trade is generally seen as a single framework of rules worldwide to drastically inhibit the flow of alien organisms (e. g.  Genetically modified organisms, imported animals) across the borders of ecoregions, to preserve their natural wild biodiversity.   It seeks to prevent ecological disasters caused by imported organisms or untested genetic technologies, and to augment and increase local natural capital by encouraging soil remediation, precision agriculture, and local consumption of the native species, rather than imported organisms and heavy use of pesticides. 

Biosecurity<====>45262<====>Biosecurity Biosecurity has multiple meanings and is defined differently according to various disciplines.  The original definition of biosecurity started out as a set of preventive measures designed to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious diseases in crops and livestock, quarantined pests, invasive alien species, and living modified organisms (Koblentz, 2010).  The emerging nature of biosecurity threats means that small scale risks blow up rapidly, thus an effective policy becomes a challenge for there are limitations on time and resources available for analysing threats and estimating the likelihood of their occurrence.   The term was first used by the agricultural and environmental communities. 

De Bruijn–Newman constant<====>45265<====>De Bruijn–Newman constantThe De Bruijn–Newman constant, denoted by Λ and named after Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn and Charles M.  Newman, is a mathematical constant defined via the zeros of a certain function H(λ, z), where λ is a real parameter and z is a complex variable.  H has only real zeros if and only if λ ≥ Λ.  The constant is closely connected with Riemann's hypothesis concerning the zeros of the Riemann zeta-function.  In brief, the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the conjecture that Λ ≤ 0. De Bruijn showed in 1950 that H has only real zeros if λ ≥ 1/2, and moreover, that if H has only real zeros for some λ, H also has only real zeros if λ is replaced by any larger value. 

Blue–green alliance<====>45266<====>Blue–green alliance  A Blue–green alliance describes either an   or coalition between "blue" conservative parties and green parties, or "blue" labor organizations, such as labor unions, and environmental organizations such as green parties.  "Blue-Green" can also refer to a right-tendency within green parties based around green conservatism. CanadaThe Green Party of Ontario and to a lesser extent, the Green Party of Canada are considered "blue–green" because they are more economically centrist or even right wing.   See Blue Greens. Czech RepublicThe Second Cabinet of Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, member of the liberal-conservative Civic Democratic Party, included the Czech Green Party. 

Measure space<====>45270<====>Measure spaceA measure space is a basic object of measure theory, a branch of mathematics  that studies generalized notions of volumes. Measure spaces contain information about the underlying set, the subsets of said set that are feasible for measuring (the   \sigma -algebra) and the method that is used for measuring (the measure). One important  example of a measure space is a probability space.Measure space should not be confused with the related measurable spaces.DefinitonA measure space is a triple   (X, \mathcal A, \mu)   , where    X   is a (nonempty) set  \mathcal A   is a   \sigma -algebra on the set   X    \mu   is a measure on   (X, \mathcal A)  ExampleSet  X=\{0,1 \}  The   \sigma -algebra on finite sets such as the one above is usually the power set, which is the set of all subsets (of a given set) and is denoted by   \mathcal P (\cdot)  . Sticking with  this convention, we set   \mathcal A=\mathcal P(X)  In this simple case, the power set can be written down explicitely:  \mathcal P(X)=\{\emptyset, \{0\}, \{1\}, X\}.  As measure, define   \mu   by   \mu(\{0\})=\mu(\{1\})=\tfrac 12,  so   \mu(X)=1   (by additivity of measures) and   \mu(\emptyset)=0   (by definition of measures).This leads to the measure space   (X, \mathcal P(X), \mu)  . It is a probability space, since   \mu(X)=1  . The measure   \mu   corresponds to the Bernoulli distribution with   p=1  , which is for example used to model a fair coin flip.Important classes of measure spacesMost important classes of measure spaces are defined by the properties of their associated measures. This includesProbability spaces, a measure space where the measure is a probability measure Finite measure spaces, where the measure is a finite measure   \sigma -finite measure spaces, where the measure is a   \sigma  -finite measure Another class of measure spaces are the complete measure spaces.

Infinite loop<====>45273<====>Infinite loop    An infinite loop (or endless loop) is a sequence of instructions in a computer program which loops endlessly, either due to the loop having no terminating condition, having one that can never be met, or one that causes the loop to start over.  In older operating systems with cooperative multitasking, infinite loops normally caused the entire system to become unresponsive.  With the now-prevalent preemptive multitasking model, infinite loops usually cause the program to consume all available processor time, but can usually be terminated by the user.  Busy wait loops are also sometimes called "infinite loops". 

Military fiat<====>45274<====>Military fiatMilitary fiat is a process whereby a decision is made and enforced by military means without the participation of other political elements.  The Latin term fiat, translated as "let it be," suggests the autocratic attitude ascribed to such a process.  For example, many coups involve the imposition of a new government by military fiat.  Origin of governmentHistorically, military fiat had no relation to particular theories of economics or how to use the power of the state ("political science").  It was simply seized by the powerful with some support from empowered citizens - typically resulting in a monarchy where power was passed on to heirs with no public consultation. 

Arthur Sullivan<====>45280<====>Arthur Sullivan   Sir Arthur Seymour Sullivan MVO (13 May 1842 – 22 November 1900) was an English composer.  He is best known for 14 operatic collaborations with the dramatist W.  S.  Gilbert, including H. M. S.  Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance and The Mikado.  His works include 24 operas, 11 major orchestral works, ten choral works and oratorios, two ballets, incidental music to several plays, and numerous church pieces, songs, and piano and chamber pieces.  His hymns and songs include "Onward, Christian Soldiers" and "The Lost Chord". 

Indigenous peoples<====>45281<====>Indigenous peoples    Indigenous peoples, also known as first peoples, aboriginal peoples or native peoples, are ethnic groups who are the original inhabitants of a given region, in contrast to groups that have settled, occupied or colonized the area more recently.  Groups are usually described as indigenous when they maintain traditions or other aspects of an early culture that is associated with a given region.  Not all indigenous peoples share this characteristic, sometimes having adopted substantial elements of a colonising culture, such as dress, religion or language.  Indigenous peoples may be settled in a given region (sedentary) or exhibit a nomadic lifestyle across a large territory, but they are generally historically associated with a specific territory on which they depend. 

Bonobo<====>45286<====>Bonobo   The bonobo (  or  ; Pan paniscus), formerly called the pygmy chimpanzee and less often, the dwarf or gracile chimpanzee,    is an endangered great ape and one of the two species making up the genus Pan; the other is Pan troglodytes, or the common chimpanzee.  Although the name "chimpanzee" is sometimes used to refer to both species together, it is usually understood as referring to the common chimpanzee, whereas Pan paniscus is usually referred to as the bonobo.    The bonobo is distinguished by relatively long legs, pink lips, dark face and tail-tuft through adulthood, and parted long hair on its head. 

Natural Capitalism<====>45291<====>Natural Capitalism Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution is a 1999 book co-authored by Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins.  It has been translated into a dozen languages and was the subject of a Harvard Business Review summary.  In Natural Capitalism the authors describe the global economy as being dependent on natural resources and ecosystem services that nature provides.  Natural Capitalism is a critique of traditional "Industrial Capitalism", saying that the traditional system of capitalism "does not fully conform to its own accounting principles.  It liquidates its capital and calls it income.  It neglects to assign any value to the largest stocks of capital it employs – the natural resources and living systems, as well as the social and cultural systems that are the basis of human capital.

Atmospheric entry<====>45294<====>Atmospheric entry Atmospheric entry is the movement of an object from outer space into and through the gases of an atmosphere of a planet, dwarf planet or natural satellite.  There are two main types of atmospheric entry: uncontrolled entry, such as the entry of astronomical objects, space debris or bolides; and controlled entry (or reentry) of a spacecraft capable of being navigated or following a predetermined course.  Technologies and procedures allowing the controlled atmospheric entry, descent and landing of spacecraft are collectively abbreviated as EDL. Atmospheric drag and aerodynamic heating can cause atmospheric breakup capable of completely disintegrating smaller objects.

Thread (computing)<====>45303<====>Thread (computing)  In computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system.   The implementation of threads and processes differs between operating systems, but in most cases a thread is a component of a process.  Multiple threads can exist within one process, executing concurrently and sharing resources such as memory, while different processes do not share these resources.  In particular, the threads of a process share its executable code and the values of its variables at any given time. 

Clifford algebra<====>45305<====>Clifford algebra In mathematics, a Clifford algebra is an algebra generated by a vector space with a quadratic form, and is a unital associative algebra.  As K-algebras, they generalize the real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions and several other hypercomplex number systems.    The theory of Clifford algebras is intimately connected with the theory of quadratic forms and orthogonal transformations.  Clifford algebras have important applications in a variety of fields including geometry, theoretical physics and digital image processing.  They are named after the English geometer William Kingdon Clifford. The most familiar Clifford algebra, or orthogonal Clifford algebra, is also referred to as Riemannian Clifford algebra.

Atomic electron transition<====>45307<====>Atomic electron transition  Atomic electron transition is a change of an electron from one energy level to another within an atom  or artificial atom.   It appears  discontinuous as the electron "jumps" from one energy level to another in a few nanoseconds or less.  It is also known as atomic transition, quantum jump, or quantum leap. Electron transitions cause the emission or absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the form of quantized units called photons.  Their statistics are Poissonian, and the time between jumps is exponentially distributed.   The damping time constant (which ranges from nanoseconds to a few seconds) relates to the natural, pressure, and field broadening of spectral lines.

Nash equilibrium<====>45337<====>Nash equilibrium In game theory, the Nash equilibrium, named after American mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr. , is a solution concept of a non-cooperative game involving two or more players in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no player has anything to gain by changing only their own strategy.  Osborne, Martin J. , and Ariel Rubinstein.  A Course in Game Theory.  Cambridge, MA: MIT, 1994.  Print.    If each player has chosen a strategy and no player can benefit by changing strategies while the other players keep theirs unchanged, then the current set of strategy choices and the corresponding payoffs constitutes a Nash equilibrium.

Ecoregion<====>45383<====>Ecoregion  An ecoregion (ecological region) is an ecologically and geographically defined area that is smaller than a bioregion, which in turn is smaller than an ecozone.  All three of these are either less or greater than an ecosystem.    Ecoregions cover relatively large areas of land or water, and contain characteristic, geographically distinct assemblages of natural communities and species.  The biodiversity of flora, fauna and ecosystems that characterise an ecoregion tends to be distinct from that of other ecoregions.  In theory, biodiversity or conservation ecoregions are relatively large areas of land or water where the probability of encountering different species and communities at any given point remains relatively constant, within an acceptable range of variation (largely undefined at this point).

Polish literature<====>45387<====>Polish literature Polish literature is the literary tradition of Poland.  Most Polish literature has been written in the Polish language, though other languages used in Poland over the centuries have also contributed to Polish literary traditions, including Latin, Yiddish, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, German and Esperanto.  According to Czesław Miłosz, for centuries Polish literature focused more on drama and poetic self-expression than on fiction (dominant in the English speaking world).  The reasons were manifold, but mostly rested on historical circumstances of the nation.  Polish writers typically have had a more profound range of choices to motivate them to write, including historical cataclysms of extraordinary violence that swept Poland (as the crossroads of Europe); but also, Poland's own collective incongruities demanding adequate reaction from the writing communities of any given period.

Pope Pius VI<====>45400<====>Pope Pius VI  Pope Pius VI (25 December  1717 – 29 August 1799), born Count Giovanni Angelo Braschi, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 15 February 1775 to his death in 1799.  Pius VI condemned the French Revolution and the suppression of the Gallican Church that resulted from it.  French troops commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte defeated the papal troops and occupied the Papal States in 1796.  In 1798, upon his refusal to renounce his temporal power, Pius was taken prisoner and transported to France.  He died one year later in Valence. 

Pope Lucius III<====>45403<====>Pope Lucius III  Pope Lucius III (c.  1100 – 25 November 1185), born Ubaldo Allucingoli, reigned from 1 September 1181 to his death in 1185.    BiographyA native of the independent republic of Lucca, he was born c.  1100 (perhaps 1097) as Ubaldo, son of Orlando.  He is commonly referred to as a member of the aristocratic family of Allucingoli, but this is not proven.   He had close ties to the Cistercians, but it seems that he never joined the order.   Pope Innocent II named him cardinal in December 1138, initially as cardinal-deacon of San Adriano, then (in May 1141) as cardinal-priest of Santa Prassede.

Pope Lucius I<====>45409<====>Pope Lucius I  Pope Lucius I (c.  200 – 5 March 254) was the Bishop of Rome from 25 June 253 to his death in 254.  He was banished soon after his consecration, but gained permission to return.  He was mistakenly classified as a martyr in the persecution of Valerian, which did not begin until after Lucius' death. A Danish legend held that the demons of Isefjord feared nothing but the skull of Lucius I, and when this skull was taken to Denmark, it brought peace, and Lucius was declared patron of Zealand.  The skull was then preserved as a national relic until carbon dating proved that it did not date back as far as his time.

Tribe<====>45413<====>Tribe   A tribe is viewed, developmentally or historically, as a social group existing outside of or before the development of states.  A tribe is a group of distinct people, dependent on their land for their livelihood, who are largely self-sufficient, and not integrated into the national society.  It is perhaps the term most readily understood and used by the general public to describe such communities.  Stephen Corry defines tribal people as those who "have followed ways of life for many generations that are largely self-sufficient, and are clearly different from the mainstream and dominant society". 

Richard D'Oyly Carte<====>45416<====>Richard D'Oyly Carte  Richard D'Oyly Carte (3 May 1844 – 3 April 1901) was an English talent agent, theatrical impresario, composer and hotelier during the latter half of the Victorian era.  Rising from humble beginnings, Carte built two of London's theatres and a hotel empire, while also establishing an opera company that ran continuously for over a hundred years and a management agency representing some of the most important artists of the day. Carte started his career working for his father, Richard Carte, in the music publishing and musical instrument manufacturing business.  As a young man, he conducted and composed music, but he soon turned to promoting the entertainment careers of others through his management agency. 

Napoleonic Wars<====>45420<====>Napoleonic Wars  The Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, financed and usually led by the United Kingdom.  The wars stemmed from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and its resultant conflict.  The wars are often categorised into five conflicts, each termed after the coalition that fought Napoleon; the Third Coalition (1805), the Fourth (1806–7), Fifth (1809), Sixth (1813), and the Seventh and final (1815).  Napoleon, upon ascending to First Consul of France in 1799, had inherited a chaotic republic; he subsequently created a state with stable finances, a strong bureaucracy, and a well-trained army.

Smart growth<====>45425<====>Smart growth Smart growth is an urban planning and transportation theory that concentrates growth in compact walkable urban centers to avoid sprawl.  It also advocates compact, transit-oriented, walkable, bicycle-friendly land use, including neighborhood schools, complete streets, and mixed-use development with a range of housing choices.The term "smart growth" is particularly used in North America.  In Europe and particularly the UK, the terms "compact city", "urban densification"  or "urban intensification" have often been used to describe similar concepts, which have influenced government planning policies in the UK, the Netherlands and several other European countries. 

Sassari<====>45427<====>Sassari Sassari (   ;  ;  ) is an Italian city and the second-largest of Sardinia in terms of population with 127,525  inhabitants, and a Functional Urban Area of about 222,000 inhabitants.   One of the oldest cities on the island, it contains a considerable collection of art. Since its origins at the turn of the 12th century, Sassari has been ruled by the Giudicato of Torres, the Pisans, the Sassaresi themselves in alliance with Genoa, the Aragonese and the Spanish, all of whom have contributed to Sassari's historical and artistic heritage.  Sassari is a city rich in art, culture and history, and is well known for its beautiful palazzi, the Fountain of the Rosello, and its elegant neoclassical architecture, such as Piazza d'Italia (Italy Square) and the Teatro Civico (Civic Theatre). 

Pane carasau<====>45430<====>Pane carasau  Pane carasau ( ;  ; from the past participle of Sardinian verb carasare "to toast", referring to the crust) is a traditional flatbread from Sardinia. It is thin and crisp, usually in the form of a dish half a meter wide.  It is made by taking baked flat bread (made of durum wheat flour, salt, yeast and water), then separating it into two sheets which are baked again.  The recipe is very ancient and was conceived for shepherds, who used to stay far from home for months at a time.  Pane carasau can last up to one year if it is kept dry. 

Bastia<====>45433<====>Bastia   Bastia ( ) ( ,  Corsican and Italian pronunciation:   ) is a French commune in the Haute-Corse department of France located in the north-east of the island of Corsica at the base of Cap Corse.   It also has the second-highest population of any commune on the island after Ajaccio and is the capital of the Bagnaja region and of the department. Bastia is the principal port of the island and its principal commercial town and is especially famous for its wines.  Approximately 10% of the population are immigrants.  The unemployment rate in the commune has persistently been one of the highest in France, standing at over 20% in 2004. 

Environmental movement<====>45434<====>Environmental movement    The environmental movement (sometimes referred to as the ecology movement), also including conservation and green politics, is a diverse scientific, social, and political movement for addressing environmental issues.  Environmentalists advocate the sustainable management of resources and stewardship of the environment through changes in public policy and individual behavior.  In its recognition of humanity as a participant in (not enemy of) ecosystems, the movement is centered on ecology, health, and human rights. The environmental movement is an international movement, represented by a range of organizations, from the large to grassroots and varies from country to country. 

Probability measure<====>45437<====>Probability measure In mathematics, a probability measure is a real-valued function defined on a set of events in a probability space that satisfies measure properties such as countable additivity.    The difference between a probability measure and the more general notion of measure (which includes concepts like area or volume) is that a probability measure must assign value 1 to the entire probability space. Intuitively, the additivity property says that the probability assigned to the union of two disjoint events by the measure should be the sum of the probabilities of the events, e. g.  the value assigned to "1 or 2" in a throw of a die should be the sum of the values assigned to "1" and "2". 

Painterliness<====>45438<====>Painterliness Painterliness is a concept based on the German term   (painterly), a word popularized by Swiss art historian Heinrich Wölfflin (1864–1945) to help focus, enrich and standardize the terms being used by art historians of his time to characterize works of art.   It is the opposite of linear, plastic or formal linear design.  An oil painting is painterly when there are visible brushstrokes, the result of applying paint in a less than completely controlled manner, generally without closely following carefully drawn lines.  Works characterized as either painterly or linear can be produced with any painting media: oils, acrylics, watercolors, gouache, etc. 

Physiocracy<====>45440<====>Physiocracy Physiocracy ( ; from the Greek for "government of nature") is an economic theory developed by a group of 18th century Enlightenment French economists who believed that the wealth of nations was derived solely from the value of "land agriculture" or "land development" and that agricultural products should be highly priced.    Their theories originated in France and were most popular during the second half of the 18th century.  Physiocracy is perhaps the first well-developed theory of economics. The movement was particularly dominated by François Quesnay (1694–1774) and Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot (1727–1781).  Steiner (2003), pp.  61–62  It immediately preceded the first modern school, classical economics, which began with the publication of Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations in 1776. 

Conservation movement<====>45441<====>Conservation movement   The conservation movement, also known as nature conservation, is a political, environmental and a social movement that seeks to protect natural resources including animal and plant species as well as their habitat for the future. The early conservation movement included fisheries and wildlife management, water, soil conservation and sustainable forestry.  The contemporary conservation movement has broadened from the early movement's emphasis on use of sustainable yield of natural resources and preservation of wilderness areas to include preservation of biodiversity.  Some say the conservation movement is part of the broader and more far-reaching environmental movement, while others argue that they differ both in ideology and practice. 

Autarky<====>45442<====>Autarky  Autarky is the quality of being self-sufficient.  Usually the term is applied to political states or their economic systems.  Autarky exists whenever an entity can survive or continue its activities without external assistance or international trade.   If a self-sufficient economy also refuses all trade with the outside world then it is called a closed economy.  Autarky is not necessarily an economic phenomenon; for example, a military autarky would be a state that could defend itself without help from another country, or could manufacture all of its weapons without any imports from the outside world. 

Imperfect competition<====>45445<====>Imperfect competitionIn economic theory, imperfect competition is a type of market structure showing some but not all features of competitive markets.

Political ecology<====>45446<====>Political ecology  Political ecology is the study of the relationships between political, economic and social factors with environmental issues and changes.  Political ecology differs from apolitical ecological studies by politicizing environmental issues and phenomena. The academic discipline offers wide-ranging studies integrating ecological social sciences with political economy  in topics such as degradation and marginalization, environmental conflict, conservation and control, and environmental identities and social movements.  OriginsThe term "political ecology" was first coined by Frank Thone in an article published in 1935.   It has been widely used since then in the context of human geography and human ecology, but with no systematic definition.

Crossbar switch<====>45456<====>Crossbar switch In electronics, a crossbar switch (cross-point switch, matrix switch) is a collection of switches arranged in a matrix configuration.  A crossbar switch has multiple input and output lines that form a crossed pattern of interconnecting lines between which a connection may be established by closing a switch located at each intersection, the elements of the matrix.  Originally, a crossbar switch consisted literally of crossing metal bars that provided the input and output paths.  Later implementations achieved the same switching topology in solid state semiconductor chips.  The cross-point switch is one of the principal switch architectures, together with a rotary switch, memory switch, and a crossover switch. 

Control flow<====>45459<====>Control flow In computer science, control flow (or flow of control) is the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated.  The emphasis on explicit control flow distinguishes an imperative programming language from a declarative programming language. Within an imperative programming language, a control flow statement is a statement the execution of which results in a choice being made as to which of two or more paths to follow.  For non-strict functional languages, functions and language constructs exist to achieve the same result, but they are usually not termed control flow statements.

Pareto efficiency<====>45468<====>Pareto efficiency Pareto efficiency or Pareto optimality is a state of allocation of resources from which it is impossible to reallocate so as to make any one individual or preference criterion better off without making at least one  individual or preference criterion worse off.  The concept is named after Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923), Italian engineer and economist, who used the concept in his studies of economic efficiency and income distribution.  The concept has been applied in academic fields such as economics, engineering, and the life sciences. The Pareto frontier is the set of all Pareto efficient allocations, conventionally shown graphically.

Lynn Margulis<====>45473<====>Lynn Margulis Lynn Margulis (born Lynn Petra Alexander;  March 5, 1938 – November 22, 2011)  was an American evolutionary theorist and biologist, science author, educator, and popularizer, and was the primary modern proponent for the significance of symbiosis in evolution.  Historian Jan Sapp has said that "Lynn Margulis's name is as synonymous with symbiosis as Charles Darwin's is with evolution. "    In particular, Margulis transformed and fundamentally framed current understanding of the evolution of cells with nuclei – an event Ernst Mayr called "perhaps the most important and dramatic event in the history of life"  – by proposing it to have been the result of symbiotic mergers of bacteria.

The most serious complications involve the heart and aorta with an increased risk of mitral valve prolapse and aortic aneurysm.    Other commonly affected areas include the lungs, eyes, bones, and the covering of the spinal cord.   Marfan is an autosomal dominant disorder. 

Utility<====>45479<====>Utility   In economics, utility is a measure of preferences over some set of goods (including services: something that satisfies human wants); it represents satisfaction experienced by the consumer from a good.   The concept is an important underpinning of rational choice theory in economics and game theory: since one cannot directly measure benefit, satisfaction or happiness from a good or service, economists instead have devised ways of representing and measuring utility in terms of measurable economic choices.  Economists have attempted to perfect highly abstract methods of comparing utilities by observing and calculating economic choices; in the simplest sense, economists consider utility to be revealed in people's willingness to pay different amounts for different goods. 

Soylent Green<====>45481<====>Soylent Green   Soylent Green is a 1973 American post-apocalyptic science fiction thriller film directed by Richard Fleischer and starring Charlton Heston and Leigh Taylor-Young.  Edward G.  Robinson appears in his final film.  Loosely based on the 1966 science fiction novel Make Room! Make Room! by Harry Harrison, it combines both police procedural and science fiction genres; the investigation into the murder of a wealthy businessman and a dystopian future of dying oceans and year-round humidity due to the greenhouse effect, resulting in suffering from pollution, poverty, overpopulation, euthanasia and depleted resources.    In 1973 it won the Nebula Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film.

Life After Life (book)<====>45491<====>Life After Life (book)  Life After Life is a 1975 book written by psychiatrist Raymond Moody.  It is a report on a qualitative study in which Moody interviewed 150 people who had undergone near-death experiences (NDEs).  The book presents the author's composite account of what it is like to die.    On the basis of his collection of cases, Moody identified a common set of elements in NDEs:  (a) an overwhelming feeling of peace and well-being, including freedom from pain. (b) the impression of being located outside one's physical body. (c) floating or drifting through darkness, sometimes described as a tunnel. 

I Am Legend (novel)<====>45492<====>I Am Legend (novel) I Am Legend is a 1954 science fiction horror novel by American writer Richard Matheson.  It was influential in the development of the zombie-vampire genre of fiction, and in popularizing the concept of a worldwide apocalypse due to disease.  The novel was a success and was adapted into the plot of films, namely: The Last Man on Earth (1964), The Omega Man (1971), I Am Legend (2007), and the direct-to-video production I Am Omega (2007).  The novel was also an inspiration behind Night of the Living Dead (1968). Plot summaryRobert Neville is the apparent sole survivor of a pandemic whose symptoms resemble vampirism.

The son of an electrician, Bergkamp was born in Amsterdam and played as an amateur in the lower leagues. 

Great Lakes Commission<====>45499<====>Great Lakes Commission The Great Lakes Commission is a United States interstate agency established in 1955 through the Great Lakes Compact, in order to "promote the orderly, integrated and comprehensive development, use and conservation of the water resources of the Great Lakes Basin," which includes the Saint Lawrence River.  The commission provides policy development, coordination, and advocacy on issues of regional concern, as well as communication and research services. The commission, in a cooperative venture with other Great Lakes agencies and organizations, hosts the Great Lakes Information Network (GLIN), an Internet-based network that serves as a decision-support tool for those who make, implement or otherwise influence public policy in the region. 

Coelacanth<====>45503<====>Coelacanth  The coelacanths (   ) constitute a now rare order of fish that includes two extant species in the genus Latimeria: the West Indian Ocean coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) primarily found near the Comoro Islands off the east coast of Africa and the Indonesian coelacanth (Latimeria menadoensis).   They follow the oldest known living lineage of Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish and tetrapods), which means they are more closely related to lungfish, reptiles, and mammals than to the common ray-finned fishes.  They are found along the coastlines of the Indian Ocean and Indonesia. Since there are only two species of coelacanth and both are threatened, it is the most endangered order of animals in the world.

World peace<====>45506<====>World peace  World peace, or peace on Earth, is the concept of an ideal state of happiness, freedom and peace within and among all people and nations on earth.  This idea of world non-violence is one motivation for people and nations to willingly cooperate, either voluntarily or by virtue of a system of governance that prevents warfare.  Different cultures, religions, philosophies and organisations have varying concepts on how such a state would come about. Various religious and secular organisations have the stated aim of achieving world peace through addressing human rights, technology, education, engineering, medicine or diplomacy used as an end to all forms of fighting. 

Treeshrew<====>45511<====>Treeshrew The treeshrews (or tree shrews or banxrings ) are small Euarchontoglire mammals native to the tropical forests of Southeast Asia.  They make up the families Tupaiidae, the treeshrews, and Ptilocercidae, the pen-tailed treeshrew, and the entire order Scandentia.  The 20 species are placed in five genera.  Treeshrews have a higher brain to body mass ratio than any other mammal, including humans,  but high ratios are not uncommon for animals weighing less than a kilogram. Though called 'treeshrews', and despite having previously been classified in Insectivora, they are not true shrews, and not all species live in trees. 

Free good<====>45515<====>Free goodA free good is a good that is not scarce, and therefore is available without limit.    A free good is available in as great a quantity as desired with zero opportunity cost to society. A good that is made available at zero price is not necessarily a free good.   For example, a shop might give away its stock in its promotion, but producing these goods would still have required the use of scarce resources. Examples of free goods are ideas and works that are reproducible at zero cost, or almost zero cost.  For example, if someone invents a new device, many people could copy this invention, with no danger of this "resource" running out. 

Seven deadly sins<====>45519<====>Seven deadly sins    The seven deadly sins, also known as the capital vices or cardinal sins, is a grouping and classification of vices within Christian teachings.Behaviours or habits are classified under this category if they directly give birth to other immoralities.According to the standard list, they are pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath and sloth,  which are also contrary to the seven virtues.  These sins are often thought to be abuses or excessive versions of one's natural faculties or passions (for example, gluttony abuses one's desire to eat). 

Toltec<====>45522<====>Toltec   The Toltec culture is an archaeological Mesoamerican culture that dominated a state centered in Tula, Hidalgo, Mexico in the early post-classic period of Mesoamerican chronology (ca.  900–1168 CE).  The later Aztec culture saw the Toltecs as their intellectual and cultural predecessors and described Toltec culture emanating from Tōllān   (Nahuatl for Tula) as the epitome of civilization; in the Nahuatl language the word Tōltēcatl   (singular) or Tōltēcah   (plural) came to take on the meaning "artisan".  The Aztec oral and pictographic tradition also described the history of the Toltec Empire, giving lists of rulers and their exploits. 

Pseudorandom number generator<====>45524<====>Pseudorandom number generator A pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), also known as a deterministic random bit generator (DRBG),  is  an algorithm for generating a sequence of numbers whose properties approximate the properties of sequences of random numbers.  The PRNG-generated sequence is not truly random, because it is completely determined by an initial value, called the PRNG's seed (which may include truly random values).  Although sequences that are closer to truly random can be generated using hardware random number generators, pseudorandom number generators are important in practice for their speed in number generation and their reproducibility.  PRNGs are central in applications such as simulations (e. 

Linear congruential generator<====>45527<====>Linear congruential generatorA linear congruential generator (LCG) is an algorithm that yields a sequence of pseudo-randomized numbers calculated with a discontinuous  piecewise linear equation.  The method represents one of the oldest and best-known pseudorandom number generator algorithms.    The theory behind them is relatively easy to understand, and they are easily implemented and fast, especially on computer hardware which can provide modulo arithmetic by storage-bit truncation. The generator is defined by the recurrence relation: X_{n+1} = \left( a X_n + c \right)~~\bmod~~m where  X  is the sequence of pseudorandom values, and  m,\, 0  – the "modulus"  a,\,0   – the "multiplier"  c,\,0 \le c   – the "increment"  X_0,\,0 \le X_0   – the "seed" or "start value"are integer constants that specify the generator. 

Opportunity cost<====>45528<====>Opportunity cost In microeconomic theory, the opportunity cost, also known as alternative cost, is the value (not a benefit) of the choice of a best alternative cost while making a decision.  A choice needs to be made between several mutually exclusive alternatives; assuming the best choice is made, it is the "cost" incurred by not enjoying the benefit that would have been had by taking the second best available choice.    The New Oxford American Dictionary defines it as "the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen. " Opportunity cost is a key concept in economics, and has been described as expressing "the basic relationship between scarcity and choice. 

Aldo Rossi<====>45534<====>Aldo Rossi  Aldo Rossi (3 May 1931 – 4 September 1997) was an Italian architect and designer who achieved international recognition in four distinct areas: theory, drawing, architecture and product design.  He was the first Italian to receive the Pritzker Prize  for architecture. Early lifeHe was born in Milan, Italy.   After early education by the Somascan Religious Order and then at Alessandro Volta College in Lecco, in 1949 he went to the school of architecture at the Polytechnic University of Milan.   His thesis advisor was Piero Portaluppi and he  graduated in 1959. 

Alessi (Italian company)<====>45535<====>Alessi (Italian company) Alessi is a housewares and kitchen utensil company in Italy, producing everyday items from plastic and metal, created by famous designers. From the 1990s onward, Alessi has been associated with the notion of "designer" objects — otherwise ordinary tools and objects executed as high design, particularly in a post-modern mode, from designers such as Philippe Starck.  Many of the early memorable "designer kettles," "designer toothbrushes," "designer kitchenware," and so on were Alessi products,  though competition in this product category has greatly increased since then. History1920s to 1940sAlessi was founded in 1921 by Giovanni Alessi.  The firm began as a workshop in Valle Strona near Lake Orta in the Italian Alps near Switzerland. 

Ustad Isa<====>45537<====>Ustad IsaUstad Isa Shirazi  (  translation Master Isa) was a Persian architect, often described as the chief architect of the Taj Mahal in Agra, India. The lack of complete and reliable information as to whom the credit for the design belongs, led to innumerable speculations.  Scholars suggest the story of Ustad Isa was born of the eagerness of the British in the 19th century to believe that such a beautiful building should be credited to a European architect.  Local informants were reported to have started British curiosity regarding the origins of the Taj by also supplying them with fictitious lists of workmen and materials from all over Asia. 

Mersenne Twister<====>45538<====>Mersenne TwisterThe Mersenne Twister is a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG).  It is by far the most widely used general-purpose PRNG.   Its name derives from the fact that its period length is chosen to be a Mersenne prime. The Mersenne Twister was developed in 1997 by   and  .   It was designed specifically to rectify most of the flaws found in older PRNGs.  It was the first PRNG to provide fast generation of high-quality pseudorandom integers. The most commonly used version of the Mersenne Twister algorithm is based on the Mersenne prime 2 19937 −1. 

Social Darwinism<====>45541<====>Social DarwinismThe term social Darwinism is used to refer to various ways of thinking and theories that emerged in the second half of the 19th century and tried to apply the evolutionary concept of natural selection to human society.  The term itself emerged in the 1880s, and it gained widespread currency when used after 1944 by opponents of these ways of thinking.  The majority of those who have been categorized as social Darwinists did not identify themselves by such a label.    Scholars debate the extent to which the various Social Darwinist ideologies reflect Charles Darwin's own views on human social and economic issues. 

Refugee<====>45547<====>Refugee   A refugee, generally speaking, is a displaced person who has been forced to cross national boundaries and who cannot return home safely (for more detail see legal definition).  Such a person may be called an asylum seeker until granted refugee status by the contracting state or the UNHCR  if they formally make a claim for asylum.  The lead international agency coordinating refugee protection is the United Nations Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).  The United Nations have a second Office for refugees, the UNRWA, which is solely responsible for supporting the large majority of Palestinian refugees.

Alghero<====>45551<====>Alghero Alghero ( ;  ,  ,  ;  ;  ), is a town of about 44,000 inhabitants in the Italian insular province of Sassari in northwestern Sardinia, next to the Mediterranean Sea.  Part of its population descends from Catalan conquerors from the end of the Middle Ages, when Sardinia was part of the Crown of Aragon.  Hence, the Catalan language is co-official (a unique situation in Italy) and known as the Alguerès dialect.  The name Alghero comes from Aleguerium, which is a mediaeval Latin word meaning 'stagnation of algae' (Posidonia oceanica) .  Alghero is the third university center in the island, coming after Cagliari and Sassari. 

United Nations trust territories<====>45552<====>United Nations trust territoriesUnited Nations trust territories were the successors of the remaining League of Nations mandates, and came into being when the League of Nations ceased to exist in 1946.  All of the trust territories were administered through the United Nations Trusteeship Council.  The one territory not turned over was South-West Africa, which South Africa insisted remained under the League of Nations Mandate.  It eventually gained independence in 1990 as Namibia.  The main objection was that the trust territory guidelines required that the lands be prepared for independence and majority rule. 

Portuguese Timor<====>45553<====>Portuguese TimorPortuguese Timor ( ) was the name of East Timor when it was under Portuguese control between 1702 to 1975.  During most of this period, Portugal shared the island of Timor with the Dutch East Indies. The first Europeans to arrive in the region were the Portuguese in 1515.  West, p.  198.

Dedekind cut<====>45569<====>Dedekind cut  In mathematics, a Dedekind cut is а method of construction of the real numbers. It is a partition of the rational numbers into two non-empty sets A and B, such that all elements of A are less than all elements of B, and A contains no greatest element.  Dedekind cuts were introduced by Richard Dedekind, but a similar construction was used in Euclid's Elements (book V, definition 5) to define proportional segments. The set B may or may not have a smallest element among the rationals.  If B has a smallest element among the rationals, the cut corresponds to that rational. 

DNA vaccination<====>45570<====>DNA vaccinationDNA vaccination is a technique for protecting against disease by injection with genetically engineered DNA so cells directly produce an antigen, producing a protective immunological response.  DNA vaccines have potential advantages over conventional vaccines, including the ability to induce a wider range of immune response types. Several DNA vaccines are available for veterinary use.  Currently no DNA vaccines have been approved for human use.  Research is investigating the approach for viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases in humans, as well as for several cancers.  HistoryVaccines have eliminated naturally occurring smallpox, and nearly eliminated polio, while other diseases, such as typhus, rotavirus, hepatitis A and B and others are well controlled. 

Southern Schleswig<====>45575<====>Southern SchleswigSouthern Schleswig (  or  ,  ) is the southern half of the former Duchy of Schleswig   in Germany on the Jutland Peninsula.

Indifference curve<====>45586<====>Indifference curveIn economics, an indifference curve connects points on a graph representing different quantities of two goods, points between which a consumer is indifferent.   That is, the consumer has no preference for one combination or bundle of goods over a different combination on the same curve.  One can also refer to each point on the indifference curve as rendering the same level of utility (satisfaction) for the consumer.  In other words, an indifference curve is the locus of various points showing different combinations of two goods providing equal utility to the consumer.  Utility is then a device to represent preferences rather than something from which preferences come.

Thomas E. Dewey<====>45596<====>Thomas E.  Dewey  Thomas Edmund Dewey (March 24, 1902 – March 16, 1971) was an American lawyer, prosecutor, and politician.  He served as the 47th Governor of New York from 1943 to 1954.  In 1944, he was the Republican Party's nominee for President.  He lost the 1944 election to President Franklin D.  Roosevelt in the closest of Roosevelt's four presidential elections.  He was again the Republican presidential nominee in 1948, but lost to President Harry S.  Truman in one of the greatest upsets in presidential election history.   Dewey played a large role in winning the Republican presidential nomination for Dwight D. 

Henry V of England<====>45597<====>Henry V of EnglandHenry V (9 August 1386 – 31 August 1422  ) was King of England from 1413 until his death at the age of 36 in 1422.  He was the second English monarch of the House of Lancaster. In his youth, Henry gained military experience fighting the Welsh during the revolt of Owain Glyndŵr, and against the powerful aristocratic House of Percy of Northumberland, at the Battle of Shrewsbury.  Henry later came into political conflict with his father, Henry IV, whose health was increasingly precarious from 1405 onward, and who had consequently started to withdraw from government functions. 

Strepsiptera<====>45598<====>Strepsiptera The Strepsiptera (translation: "twisted wing"', giving rise to the insects' common name, twisted-wing parasites) are an endopterygote order of insects with nine extant families making up about 600 species.  The early-stage larvae and the short-lived adult males are not sessile, but most of their lives are spent as endoparasites in other insects, such as bees, wasps, leafhoppers, silverfish, and cockroaches.    Appearance and biologyMales of the Strepsiptera have wings, legs, eyes, and antennae, and superficially look like flies, though their mouthparts cannot be used for feeding.  Many of their mouthparts are modified into sensory structures. 

Surgery<====>45599<====>Surgery   Surgery (from the   cheirourgikē (composed of χείρ, "hand", and ἔργον, "work"), via  , meaning "hand work") is a medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate or treat a pathological condition such as a disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas. The act of performing surgery may be called a "surgical procedure", "operation", or simply "surgery".  In this context, the verb "operate" means to perform surgery.  The adjective "surgical" means pertaining to surgery; e. g.  surgical instruments or surgical nurse. 

Reed–Solomon error correction<====>45600<====>Reed–Solomon error correction Reed–Solomon codes are a group of error-correcting codes that were introduced by Irving S.  Reed and Gustave Solomon in 1960.  They have many applications, the most prominent of which include consumer technologies such as CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, QR Codes, data transmission technologies such as DSL and WiMAX, broadcast systems such as DVB and ATSC, and storage systems such as RAID 6.  They are also used in satellite communication. In coding theory, the Reed–Solomon code belongs to the class of non-binary cyclic error-correcting codes.  The Reed–Solomon code is based on univariate polynomials over finite fields. 

Zorba the Greek (film)<====>45606<====>Zorba the Greek (film)   Zorba the Greek ( , Alexis Zorba(s)) is a 1964 British-Greek comedy-drama film written, produced, edited, and directed by Cypriot Michael Cacoyannis and starring Anthony Quinn as the title character.  Based on the 1946 novel of the same name by Nikos Kazantzakis, the film's cast includes Alan Bates, Lila Kedrova, Irene Papas, and Sotiris Moustakas. PlotBasil is a British-Greek writer raised in Britain who bears the hallmarks of an uptight, middle-class Englishman.  He is waiting at the Athens port of Piraeus on mainland Greece to catch a boat to Crete when he meets a gruff, yet enthusiastic Greek-Macedonian peasant and musician named Zorba. 

Biosecurity protocol<====>45607<====>Biosecurity protocol Biosecurity protocol refers to several politically controversial attempts to unify global biosecurity measures and responses, in a similar manner to a biosafety protocol.  Although some propose a "Biosecurity Protocol" to extend the Biosafety Protocol to organisms considered weapons (already controlled by UN arms proliferation treaties), others argue this is an inappropriate response to military threats, and argue for a broad biodefense instead.   As of 2002, the latter view was prevalent in military and scientific circles, the former in NGOs, some United Nations agencies, and Green Parties.   Most cooperation was restricted to attempts to define "biosecurity" itself. 

Cheetah<====>45609<====>CheetahThe cheetah   (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large felid of the subfamily Felinae that occurs mainly in eastern and southern Africa and a few parts of Iran.  It is the fastest land animal.  The only extant member of the genus Acinonyx, the cheetah was formally described by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1775.  The cheetah is characterised by a slender body, deep chest, spotted coat, small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, long thin legs and long spotted tail.  Its lightly built, slender form is in sharp contrast with the robust build of the big cats, making it more similar to the cougar. 

Mata Hari<====>45610<====>Mata Hari   Margaretha Geertruida "Margreet" MacLeod (née Zelle; 7 August 1876 15 October 1917), better known by the stage name Mata Hari, was a Dutch exotic dancer and courtesan who was convicted of being a spy for Germany during World War I Howe, Russel Warren (1986).

Dr. Feelgood (band)<====>45611<====>Dr.  Feelgood (band)    Dr.  Feelgood are a British pub rock band formed in 1971.   Hailing from Canvey Island, Essex, the group are best known for early singles such as "She Does It Right", "Roxette", "Back in the Night" and "Milk and Alcohol" .  The group's original distinctively British R&B sound was centred on Wilko Johnson's choppy guitar style.  Along with Johnson, the original band line-up included singer Lee Brilleaux and the rhythm section of John B.  Sparks, known as "Sparko", on bass guitar  and John Martin, known as "The Big Figure", on drums. 

Lagged Fibonacci generator<====>45619<====>Lagged Fibonacci generatorA Lagged Fibonacci generator (LFG or sometimes LFib) is an example of a pseudorandom number generator.  This class of random number generator is aimed at being an improvement on the 'standard' linear congruential generator.  These are based on a generalisation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence may be described by the recurrence relation: S_n = S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} Hence, the new term is the sum of the last two terms in the sequence.  This can be generalised to the sequence: S_n \equiv S_{n-j} \star S_{n-k}  \pmod{m},   0  In which case, the new term is some combination of any two previous terms. 

Psychopharmacology<====>45621<====>Psychopharmacology Psychopharmacology (from Greek  , psȳkhē, "breath, life, soul";  , pharmakon, "drug"; and  ,  ) is the scientific study of the effects drugs have on mood, sensation, thinking, and behavior.  It is distinguished from neuropsychopharmacology, which emphasizes the correlation between drug-induced changes in the functioning of cells in the nervous system and changes in consciousness and behavior.    The field of psychopharmacology studies a wide range of substances with various types of psychoactive properties, focusing primarily on the chemical interactions with the brain.  The term "psychopharmacology" was probably first coined by David Macht in 1920. 

Iranian Green Movement<====>45622<====>Iranian Green Movement The Iranian Green Movement ( ), also known as the Persian Awakening or Persian Spring by the western media,  refers to a political movement that arose after the 2009 Iranian presidential election, in which protesters demanded the removal of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad from office.  Green was initially used as the symbol of Mir Hossein Mousavi's campaign, but after the election it became the symbol of unity and hope for those asking for annulment of what they regarded as a fraudulent election.  Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi are recognized as political leaders of the Green Movement.

Telephony Application Programming Interface<====>45631<====>Telephony Application Programming InterfaceThe Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) is a Microsoft Windows API, which provides computer telephony integration and enables PCs running Microsoft Windows to use telephone services.  Different versions of TAPI are available on different versions of Windows.  TAPI allows applications to control telephony functions between a computer and telephone network for data, fax, and voice calls.  It includes basic functions, such as dialing, answering, and hanging up a call.  It also supports supplementary functions, such as hold, transfer, conference, and call park found in PBX, ISDN, and other telephone systems.  TAPI is used primarily to control either modems or, more recently, to control business telephone system (PBX) handsets. 

Economic history<====>45633<====>Economic history  Economic history is the study of economies or economic phenomena of the past.  Analysis in economic history is undertaken using a combination of historical methods, statistical methods and the application of economic theory to historical situations and institutions.  The topic includes financial and business history and overlaps with areas of social history such as demographic and labor history.  The quantitative—in this case, econometric—study of economic history is also known as cliometrics.  Development as a separate fieldIn Germany in the late 19th century, scholars in a number of universities, led by Gustav von Schmoller, developed the historical school of economic history. 

Thread safety<====>45634<====>Thread safety Thread safety is a computer programming concept applicable to multi-threaded code.  Thread-safe code only manipulates shared data structures in a manner that ensures that all threads behave properly and fulfil their design specifications without unintended interaction.  There are various strategies for making thread-safe data structures.   A program may execute code in several threads simultaneously in a shared address space where each of those threads has access to virtually all of the memory of every other thread.  Thread safety is a property that allows code to run in multithreaded environments by re-establishing some of the correspondences between the actual flow of control and the text of the program, by means of synchronization. 

Top-down and bottom-up design<====>45635<====>Top-down and bottom-up design    Top-down and bottom-up are both strategies of information processing and knowledge ordering, used in a variety of fields including software, humanistic and scientific theories (see systemics), and management and organization.  In practice, they can be seen as a style of thinking, teaching, or leadership. A top-down approach (also known as stepwise design and in some cases used as a synonym of decomposition) is essentially the breaking down of a system to gain insight into its compositional sub-systems in a reverse engineering fashion.  In a top-down approach an overview of the system is formulated, specifying, but not detailing, any first-level subsystems. 

Borland Turbo C<====>45636<====>Borland Turbo C  Turbo C is a discontinued Integrated Development Environment and compiler for the C programming language from Borland.  First introduced in 1987, it was noted for its integrated development environment, small size, fast compile speed, comprehensive manuals and low price. In May 1990, Borland replaced Turbo C with Turbo C++.  In 2006, Borland reintroduced the Turbo moniker. Early historyIn the early 1980s, Borland enjoyed considerable success with their Turbo Pascal product and it became a popular choice when developing applications for the PC.  Borland followed up that success by releasing Turbo Basic, Turbo Prolog and Turbo C. 

Undocumented feature<====>45638<====>Undocumented feature Undocumented features are frequently found in software releases.  Sometimes the documentation is omitted through simple oversight, but undocumented features are often elements of the software not intended for use by end users, but left available for use by the vendor for software support and development. Since the suppliers of the software usually consider the software documentation to constitute a contract for the behavior of the software, undocumented features are generally left unsupported, and may be removed or changed at will and without notice to the users. Sometimes such a feature (for example, the ability to change the switch character in MS-DOS, usually to a hyphen) is included for compatibility (in this case with Unix utilities) or future-expansion reasons, but if the software provider changes their mind or goes out of business, the absence of documentation makes it easier to justify the feature's removal. 

Bal Gangadhar Tilak<====>45639<====>Bal Gangadhar Tilak  Bal Gangadhar Tilak (or Lokmanya Tilak,  ; 23 July 1856 – 1 August 1920), born as Keshav Gangadhar Tilak, was an Indian nationalist, teacher, social reformer, lawyer and an independence activist.  He was the first leader of the Indian Independence Movement.  The British colonial authorities called him "The father of the Indian unrest. " He was also conferred with the title of "Lokmanya", which means "accepted by the people (as their leader)".    Tilak was one of the first and strongest advocates of Swaraj ("self-rule") and a strong radical in Indian consciousness. 

Demography<====>45642<====>Demography   Demography (from prefix demo- from Ancient Greek δῆμος dēmos meaning "the people", and -graphy from γράφω graphō, implies "writing, description or measurement" ) is the statistical study of populations, especially human beings.  As a very general science, it can analyze any kind of dynamic living population, i. e. , one that changes over time or space (see population dynamics).   Demography encompasses the study of the size, structure, and distribution of these populations, and spatial or temporal changes in them in response to birth, migration, aging, and death.  Based on the demographic research of the earth, earth's population up to the year 2050 and 2100 can be estimated by demographers. 

Krishna Chandra Bhattacharya<====>45645<====>Krishna Chandra Bhattacharya   Krishna Chandra Bhattacharya, also known as K. C.  Bhattacharya, (12 May 1875 – 11 December 1949) was a philosopher at the University of Calcutta known for his method of "constructive interpretation" through which relations and problematics of ancient Indian philosophical systems are drawn out and developed so that they can be studied like problems of modern philosophy.   He was especially interested in the problematic of how the mind (or consciousness) creates an apparently material universe.Bhattacharya encouraged the idea of an immersive cosmopolitanism in which Indian systems of philosophy were modernized through assimilation and immersion rather than to through a blind imitation of European ideas. 

Nightjar<====>45648<====>Nightjar  Nightjars are medium-sized nocturnal or crepuscular birds in the family Caprimulgidae, characterized by long wings, short legs and very short bills.  They are sometimes called goatsuckers, due to the ancient folk tale that they sucked the milk from goats (the Latin for goatsucker is Caprimulgus), or bugeaters,  due to their insectivore diet.  Some New World species are called nighthawks.  The English word 'nightjar' originally referred to the European nightjar. Nightjars are found around the world.  They are mostly active in the late evening and early morning or at night, usually nest on the ground, and feed predominantly on moths and other large flying insects.

Ram Mohan Roy<====>45652<====>Ram Mohan Roy  	  Raja Ram Mohan Roy (22 May 1772 – 27 September 1833) was the founder of the Brahmo Sabha movement in 1828, which engendered the Brahmo Samaj, an influential social-religious reform movement.   His influence was apparent in the fields of politics, public administration and education as well as religion.  He was known for his efforts to abolish the practice of sati, the Hindu funeral practice in which the widow was compelled to sacrifice herself in her husband’s funeral pyre in some parts of Bengal.   Raja Ram Mohan Roy was known as the Father of the Indian Renaissance. 

Dayananda Saraswati<====>45654<====>Dayananda Saraswati Dayanand Saraswati   (12 February 1824 – 30 October 1883) was a Hindu religious leader and founder of the Arya Samaj, a Hindu reform movements of the Vedic tradition.  He was also a renowned scholar of the Vedic lore and Sanskrit language.  He was the first to give the call for Swaraj as "Indian for India" in 1876, a call later taken up by Lokmanya Tilak.    Denouncing the idolatry and ritualistic worship prevalent in Hinduism at the time, he worked towards reviving Vedic ideologies.  Subsequently, the philosopher and President of India, S. 

Swami Vivekananda<====>45660<====>Swami Vivekananda Swami Vivekananda  ( ; 12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta ( ), was an Indian Hindu monk, a chief disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic Ramakrishna.He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world   and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century.   He was a major force in the revival of Hinduism in India, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India. 

A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada<====>45667<====>A.  C.

Adherents of the ISKCON movement view Prabhupada as a pure devotee and messenger of Krishna.  Born Abhay Charan De in Calcutta, he was educated at the Scottish Church College in Calcutta.   Before adopting the life of a pious renunciant (vanaprastha) in 1950,    he was married with children and owned a small pharmaceutical business. 

Primary Chronicle<====>45675<====>Primary Chronicle  The Tale of Past Years ( , Pověstĭ Vremęnĭnyhŭ Lětŭ) or Primary Chronicle is a history of Kievan Rus' from about 850 to 1110, originally compiled in Kiev about 1113.  The work is considered to be a fundamental source in the interpretation of the history of the Eastern Slavs.  Three editionsFirstTradition long regarded the original compilation as the work of a monk named Nestor (c.  1056 – c.  1114); hence scholars spoke of Nestor's Chronicle or of Nestor's manuscript.  His compilation has not survived.  Nestor's many sources included the earlier but now lost Slavonic chronicles; the Byzantine annals of John Malalas, a Greek chronicler, who in 563 produced an 18 book work of intertwined myth and truth; and the Byzantine annals of George Hamartolus, a monk, who tried to adhere strictly to truth, and whose works are the unique contemporary source for the period 813–842. 

Atonality<====>45678<====>Atonality Atonality in its broadest sense is music that lacks a tonal center, or key.  Atonality, in this sense, usually describes compositions written from about 1908 to the present day where a hierarchy of pitches focusing on a single, central tone is not used, and the notes of the chromatic scale function independently of one another  .   More narrowly, the term atonality describes music that does not conform to the system of tonal hierarchies that characterized classical European music between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries  .   "The repertory of atonal music is characterized by the occurrence of pitches in novel combinations, as well as by the occurrence of familiar pitch combinations in unfamiliar environments"  . 

Inverse transform sampling<====>45705<====>Inverse transform samplingInverse transform sampling (also known as inversion sampling, the inverse probability integral transform, the inverse transformation method, Smirnov transform, golden rule Aalto University, N.

Twelfth lecture https://noppa. tkk. fi/noppa/kurssi/mat-1. 3626/luennot/Mat-1_3626_lecture12. pdf  ) is a basic method for pseudo-random number sampling, i. e.  for generating sample numbers at random from any probability distribution given its cumulative distribution function. Inverse transformation sampling takes uniform samples of a number  u  between 0 and 1, interpreted as a probability, and then returns the largest number  x  from the domain of the distribution  P(X)  such that  P(-\infty  . 

Nevi'im<====>45707<====>Nevi'imNevi'im ( ;    Nəḇî'îm, lit.  "spokespersons", "Prophets") is the second main division of the Hebrew Bible (the Tanakh), between the Torah (instruction) and Ketuvim (writings).  The Nevi'im are divided into two groups.  The Former Prophets (  Nevi'im Rishonim) consists of the narrative books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings; while the Latter Prophets (  Nevi'im Aharonim) include the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and The Twelve minor prophets. SynopsisIn Judaism, Samuel and Kings are each counted as one book.  In addition, twelve relatively short prophetic books are counted as one in a single collection called Trei Asar or "The Twelve Minor Prophets". 

Coordinate covalent bond<====>45708<====>Coordinate covalent bondA coordinate covalent bond,  also known as a dative bond  or coordinate bond  is a kind of 2-center, 2-electron covalent bond in which the two electrons derive from the same atom.   The bonding of metal ions to ligands involves this kind of interaction. Examples Coordinate covalent bonding is pervasive.  In all metal aquo-complexes [M(H 2 O) n ] x+ , the bonding between water and the metal cation is described as a coordinate covalent bond.   Metal-ligand interactions in most organometallic compounds and most coordination compounds are described similarly. The term dipolar bond is used in organic chemistry for compounds such as amine oxides for which the electronic structure can be described in terms of the basic amine donating two electrons to an oxygen atom. 

Forensic science<====>45710<====>Forensic science   Forensic science is the application of science to criminal and civil laws, mainly—on the criminal side—during criminal investigation, as governed by the legal standards of admissible evidence and criminal procedure. Forensic scientists collect, preserve, and analyze scientific evidence during the course of an investigation.  While some forensic scientists travel to the scene of the crime to collect the evidence themselves, others occupy a laboratory role, performing analysis on objects brought to them by other individuals.    In addition to their laboratory role, forensic scientists testify as expert witnesses in both criminal and civil cases and can work for either the prosecution or the defense. 

Eggplant<====>45712<====>Eggplant   Eggplant (Solanum melongena), or aubergine, is a species of nightshade, grown for its edible fruit.  Eggplant is the common name in North America, Australia and New Zealand, but British English uses the French word aubergine.   It is known in South Asia and South Africa as brinjal.    The fruit is widely used in cooking.  As a member of the genus Solanum, it is related to the tomato and the potato.  It was originally domesticated from the wild nightshade species, the thorn or bitter apple, S.  incanum, Tsao and Lo in "Vegetables: Types and Biology". 

Horseradish<====>45714<====>Horseradish  Horseradish (Armoracia rusticana, syn.  Cochlearia armoracia) is a perennial plant of the Brassicaceae family (which also includes mustard, wasabi, broccoli, and cabbage).  It is a root vegetable used as a spice. The plant is probably native to southeastern Europe and western Asia.  It is popular worldwide.  It grows up to   tall, and is cultivated primarily for its large, white, tapered root.The intact horseradish root has hardly any aroma.  When cut or grated enzymes from the now-broken plant cells break down sinigrin (a glucosinolate) to produce allyl isothiocyanate (mustard oil), which irritates the mucous membranes of the sinuses and eyes. 

Arecaceae<====>45715<====>Arecaceae  The Arecaceae are a botanical family of perennial climbers, shrubs, acaules and trees commonly known as palm trees (owing to historical usage, the family is alternatively called Palmae).   They are flowering plants, a family in the monocot order Arecales.  Currently 181 genera with around 2600 species are known,    most of them restricted to tropical and subtropical climates.  Most palms are distinguished by their large, compound, evergreen leaves, known as fronds, arranged at the top of an unbranched stem.  However, palms exhibit an enormous diversity in physical characteristics and inhabit nearly every type of habitat within their range, from rainforests to deserts. 

Transporter (Star Trek)<====>45716<====>Transporter (Star Trek)DISPLAYTITLE A transporter is a fictional teleportation machine used in the Star Trek universe.  Transporters convert a person or object into an energy pattern (a process called dematerialization), then "beam" it to a target, where it is reconverted into matter (rematerialization).   The term "transporter accident" is a catch-all term for when a person or object does not rematerialize correctly. According to The Making of Star Trek, Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's original plan did not include transporters, instead calling for characters to land the starship itself.  However, this would have required unfeasible and unaffordable sets and model filming, as well as episode running time spent while landing, taking off, etc. 

Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein<====>45720<====>Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein  Schleswig ( ;  ; South Jutlandic: Sljasvig; archaic English: Sleswick;  ) is a town in the northeastern part of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.  It is the capital of the Kreis (district) Schleswig-Flensburg.  It has a population of about 27,000, the main industries being leather and food processing.  It takes its name from the Schlei, an inlet of the Baltic sea at the end of which it sits, and "vik" or "vig" which means bay in Old Norse and Danish.  Schleswig or Slesvig therefore means bay of the Schlei. GeographyThe city lies at the western end of the Schlei Förde, which separates the two peninsulas of Angeln and Schwansen, and is on the western edge of the Schleswig-Holstein Uplands on the transition to the Geest country. 

Hamburger<====>45728<====>HamburgerA hamburger, beefburger or burger is a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun.  The patty may be pan fried, barbecued, or flame broiled.  Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, bacon, onion, pickles, or chiles; condiments such as mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup, relish, or "special sauce"; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns.  A hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger. The term "burger" can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the UK where the term "patty" is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to ground beef. 

Panthera<====>45729<====>Panthera   Panthera is a genus within the Felidae family that was named and first described by the German naturalist Oken in 1816.   The British taxonomist Pocock revised the classification of this genus in 1916 as comprising the species lion, tiger, jaguar, and leopard on the basis of cranial features.  Pocock, R.  I.  (1916).  The Classification and Generic Nomenclature of F.  uncia and its Allies.  The Annals and Magazine of Natural History: zoology, botany, and geology.  Series 8, Volume XVIII: 314–316.   Results of genetic analysis indicate that the snow leopard also belongs to the Panthera, a classification that was accepted by IUCN assessors in 2008. 

Hieronymus Bosch<====>45732<====>Hieronymus Bosch  Hieronymus Bosch ( ;   ;  born Jheronimus van Aken   ;    1450 – 9 August 1516) was a Dutch/Netherlandish draughtsman and painter from Brabant.  He is widely considered one of the most notable representatives of Early Netherlandish painting school.  His work is known for its fantastic imagery, detailed landscapes, and illustrations of religious concepts and narratives.   Within his lifetime his work was collected in the Netherlands, Austria, and Spain, and widely copied, especially his macabre and nightmarish depictions of hell. Little is known of Bosch's life, though there are some records. 

Visual DialogScript<====>45738<====>Visual DialogScriptVisual DialogScript (VDS) is an interpreted programming language for Microsoft Windows.  It can be used to create small, fast programs.  VDS has a large number of dialog and graphical elements available to create professional looking programs.  VDS programs have access to the Windows API; therefore, it is possible to write applications that can perform the same advanced tasks as other programming languages such as Visual Basic, C++, or Delphi. LanguageUnlike other programming languages, the syntax of VDS is very simple.  Each command occupies one line, and has a plain English name that clearly describes its purpose. 

Mazara del Vallo<====>45742<====>Mazara del Vallo  Mazara del Vallo ( ;  )  is a town and comune in southwestern Sicily, Italy, which lies mainly on the left bank at the mouth of the Mazaro river, administratively part of the province of Trapani. It is an agricultural and fishing centre and its port gives shelter to the largest fishing fleet in Italy. HistoryAncient townMazara was founded by the Phoenicians in the 9th century BC, with the name of Mazar (the Rock).  It then passed under the control of Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Ostrogoths, Byzantines, before being occupied by the Arabs in the year 827 AD. 

Asti<====>45743<====>Asti   Astiis a city and comune of 76 164 inhabitants (1-1-2017) located in the Piedmont region of northwestern Italy, about   east of Turin in the plain of the Tanaro River.  It is the capital of the province of Asti and it is deemed to be the modern capital of Monferrato (Montferrat in English). HistoryAncient times and early Middle AgesPeople have lived in and around what is now Asti since the Neolithic period.  Before their defeat in 174 BC by the Romans, tribes of Ligures, the Statielli, dominated the area and the toponym probably derives from Ast which means "hill" in the ancient Celtic language.

Dacia<====>45745<====>Dacia In ancient geography, especially in Roman sources, Dacia ( ) was the land inhabited by the Dacians.  The Greeks referred to them as the Getae (east of Dacia) and the Romans as Daci. Dacia was bounded in the south approximately by the Danubius river (Danube), in Greek sources the Istros, or at its greatest extent, by the Haemus Mons.  Moesia (Dobruja), a region south-east of the Danube, was a core area where the Getae lived and interacted with the Ancient Greeks.  In the east it was bounded by the Pontus Euxinus (Black Sea) and the river Danastris (Dniester), in Greek sources the Tyras. 

Carpathian Mountains<====>45746<====>Carpathian Mountains   The Carpathian Mountains or Carpathians ( ) are a mountain range system forming an arc roughly   long across Central and Eastern Europe, making them the second-longest mountain range in Europe (after the Scandinavian Mountains,  ). They provide the habitat for the largest European populations of brown bears, wolves, chamois, and lynxes, with the highest concentration in Romania,    as well as over one third of all European plant species.   The Carpathians and their foothills also have many thermal and mineral waters, with Romania having one-third of the European total. 

Weapons in Star Trek<====>45747<====>Weapons in Star Trek  DISPLAYTITLE  The Star Trek fictional universe contains a variety of weapons, ranging from missiles (the classic photon torpedo) to melee (primarily used by the Klingons, a race of aliens in the Star Trek universe).  The Star Trek franchise consists primarily of several multi-season television shows and a dozen movies, as well as various video games and inspired merchandise.  Many aspects of the fictional universe impact modern popular culture, especially the lingo and the idea of a spacecraft launching space torpedoes and firing lasers, and have had a wide influence in the late 20th to early 21st century. 

Chariot<====>45748<====>Chariot A chariot is a type of carriage driven by a charioteer using primarily horses  to provide rapid motive power.  Chariots were used by armies as transport or mobile archery platforms, for hunting or for racing, and as a conveniently fast way to travel for many ancient people. The word "chariot" comes from the Latin term carrus, a loanword from Gaulish.  A chariot of war or one used in military parades was called a car.  In ancient Rome and some other ancient Mediterranean civilizations, a biga required two horses, a triga three, and a quadriga four. 

Peloponnese<====>45749<====>Peloponnese  The Peloponnese ( ) or Peloponnesus ( ;  , Pelopónnēsos) is a peninsula and geographic region in southern Greece.  It is separated from the central part of the country by the Isthmus and Gulf of Corinth.  During the late Middle Ages and the Ottoman era, the peninsula was known as the Morea ( ), a name still in colloquial use in its demotic form (Μωριάς). The peninsula is divided among three administrative regions: most belongs to the Peloponnese region, with smaller parts belonging to the West Greece and Attica regions. In 2016, Lonely Planet voted the Peloponnese the top spot of their Best in Europe list. 

Topological vector space<====>45752<====>Topological vector spaceIn mathematics, a topological vector space (also called a linear topological space) is one of the basic structures investigated in functional analysis.  As the name suggests the space blends a topological structure (a uniform structure to be precise) with the algebraic concept of a vector space. The elements of topological vector spaces are typically functions or linear operators acting on topological vector spaces, and the topology is often defined so as to capture a particular notion of convergence of sequences of functions. Hilbert spaces and Banach spaces are well-known examples. Unless stated otherwise, the underlying field of a topological vector space is assumed to be either the complex numbers C or the real numbers R. 

Where Mathematics Comes From<====>45754<====>Where Mathematics Comes From Where Mathematics Comes From: How the Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics into Being (hereinafter WMCF) is a book by George Lakoff, a cognitive linguist, and Rafael E.  Núñez, a psychologist.  Published in 2000, WMCF seeks to found a cognitive science of mathematics, a theory of embodied mathematics based on conceptual metaphor. WMCF definition of mathematicsMathematics makes up that part of the human conceptual system that is special in the following way:"It is precise, consistent, stable across time and human communities, symbolizable, calculable, generalizable, universally available, consistent within each of its subject matters, and effective as a general tool for description, explanation, and prediction in a vast number of everyday activities, [ranging from] sports, to building, business, technology, and science. 

Pyrite<====>45756<====>Pyrite   The mineral pyrite, or iron pyrite, also known as fool's gold, is an iron sulfide with the chemical formula Fe S 2 .  Pyrite is considered the most common of the sulfide minerals. Pyrite's metallic luster and pale brass-yellow hue give it a superficial resemblance to gold, hence the well-known nickname of fool's gold.  The color has also led to the nicknames brass, brazzle, and Brazil, primarily used to refer to pyrite found in coal.   The name pyrite is derived from the Greek πυρίτης (pyritēs), "of fire" or "in fire",  in turn from πύρ (pyr), "fire".

Kinshasa<====>45773<====>Kinshasa    Kinshasa ( ;  ; formerly Léopoldville (  or Dutch   )) is the capital and the largest city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  It is situated on the Congo River. Once a site of fishing and trading villages, Kinshasa is now a megacity with an estimated population of more than 11 million.   It faces Brazzaville, the capital of the neighbouring Republic of the Congo, which can be seen in the distance across the wide Congo River, making them the two closest capital cities on Earth after Rome and the Vatican City. 

Colonization<====>45775<====>Colonization Colonization  (or colonisation) is a process by which a central system of power dominates the surrounding land and its components. The term is derived from the Latin word colere, which means "to inhabit".Also, colonization refers strictly to migration, for example, to settler colonies in America or Australia, trading posts, and plantations, while colonialism deals with this, along with ruling the existing indigenous peoples of styled "new territories". Colonization was linked to the spread of tens of millions from Western European states all over the world.  In many settled colonies, Western European settlers formed a large majority of the population. 

Reform Act 1832<====>45777<====>Reform Act 1832  The Representation of the People Act 1832 (known informally as the 1832 Reform Act, Great Reform Act or First Reform Act to distinguish it from subsequent Reform Acts) was an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom (indexed as 2 & 3 Will.  IV c.  45) that introduced wide-ranging changes to the electoral system of England and Wales.  According to its preamble, the Act was designed to "take effectual Measures for correcting divers Abuses that have long prevailed in the Choice of Members to serve in the Commons House of Parliament".   Before the reform, most members nominally represented boroughs.

Spencer Tracy<====>45782<====>Spencer Tracy   Spencer Bonaventure Tracy (April 5, 1900 – June 10, 1967)  was an American actor, noted for his natural style and versatility.  One of the major stars of Hollywood's Golden Age, Tracy won two Academy Awards for Best Actor, from nine nominations, sharing the record for nominations in that category with Laurence Olivier. Tracy first discovered his talent for acting while attending Ripon College, and he later received a scholarship for the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.  He spent seven years in the theatre, working in a succession of stock companies and intermittently on Broadway. 

Genotype–phenotype distinction<====>45783<====>Genotype–phenotype distinctionThe genotype–phenotype distinction is drawn in genetics.   "Genotype" is an organism's full hereditary information.  "Phenotype" is an organism's actual observed properties, such as morphology, development, or behavior.   This distinction is fundamental in the study of inheritance of traits and their evolution. It is the organism's physical properties which directly determine its chances of survival and reproductive output,  while the inheritance of physical properties occurs only as a secondary consequence of the inheritance of genes.  Therefore, to properly understand the theory of evolution via natural selection, one must understand the genotype–phenotype distinction.   The genes contribute to a trait, and the phenotype is the observable expression of the genes (and therefore the genotype that affects the trait). 

Biomimetics<====>45784<====>Biomimetics Biomimetics or biomimicry is the imitation of the models, systems, and elements of nature for the purpose of solving complex human problems.   The terms "biomimetics" and "biomimicry" derive from   (bios), life, and μίμησις (mīmēsis), imitation, from μιμεῖσθαι (mīmeisthai), to imitate, from μῖμος (mimos), actor.  A closely related field is bionics.  Living organisms have evolved well-adapted structures and materials over geological time through natural selection.  Biomimetics has given rise to new technologies inspired by biological solutions at macro and nanoscales.  Humans have looked at nature for answers to problems throughout our existence. 

Janet Gaynor<====>45794<====>Janet Gaynor  Janet Gaynor (born Laura Augusta Gainor; October 6, 1906 – September 14, 1984) was an American film, stage and television actress and painter. Gaynor began her career as an extra in shorts and silent films.  After signing with Fox Film Corporation (later 20th Century-Fox) in 1926, she rose to fame and became one of the biggest box office draws of the era.  In 1929, she was the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performances in three films: 7th Heaven (1927), Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927), and Street Angel (1928). 

Natural capital<====>45795<====>Natural capitalNatural capital is the world's stock of natural resources, which includes geology, soils, air, water and all living organisms.  Some natural capital assets provide people with free goods and services, often called ecosystem services.  Two of these (clean water and fertile soil) underpin our economy and society and make human life possible.   It is an extension of the economic notion of capital (resources which enable the production of more resources) to goods and services provided by the natural environment.  For example, a well-maintained forest or river may provide an indefinitely sustainable flow of new trees or fish, whereas over-use of those resources may lead to a permanent decline in timber availability or fish stocks. 

Clouded leopard<====>45798<====>Clouded leopard  The clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) is a wild cat occurring from the Himalayan foothills through mainland Southeast Asia into China.  Since 2008, it is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.  Its total population is suspected to be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals, with a decreasing population trend, and no single population numbering more than 1,000 adults.The clouded leopard is the state animal of the Indian state of Meghalaya.  TaxonomyThe scientific name of the clouded leopard is Neofelis nebulosa.  It is one of two members of the genus Neofelis, and is classified under the family Felidae. 

Public capital<====>45800<====>Public capital Public capital is the aggregate body of government-owned assets that are used as a means for productivity.  Aschauer, D.  A.  (1990).  Why is infrastructure important? Conference Series [Proceedings].  Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.  Pp.  21-68.   Such assets span a wide range including: large components such as highways, airports, roads, transit systems, and railways; local, municipal components such as public education, public hospitals, police and fire protection, prisons, and courts; and critical components including water and sewer systems, public electric and gas utilities, and telecommunications.  Tatam, J.  A. 

Physical capital<====>45801<====>Physical capital In economics, physical capital or just capital is a factor of production (or input into the process of production), consisting of machinery, buildings, computers, and the like.  The production function takes the general form Y=f(K, L), where Y is the amount of output produced, K is the amount of capital stock used and L is the amount of labor used.  In economic theory, physical capital is one of the three primary factors of production, also known as inputs in the production function.  The others are  natural resources (including land), and labor—the stock of competences embodied in the labor force. 

Social capital<====>45802<====>Social capital    Social capital is a form of economic and cultural capital in which social networks are central; transactions are marked by reciprocity, trust, and cooperation; and market agents produce goods and services not mainly for themselves, but for a common good. The term generally refers to (a) resources, and the value of these resources, both tangible (public spaces, private property) and intangible ("actors", "human capital", people), (b) the relationships among these resources, and (c) the impact that these relationships have on the resources involved in each relationship, and on larger groups.  It is generally seen as a form of capital that produces public goods for a common good. 

Individual capital<====>45803<====>Individual capital Individual capital, the economic view of talent, comprises inalienable or personal traits of persons, tied to their bodies and available only through their own free will, such as skill, creativity, enterprise, courage, capacity for moral example,  non-communicable wisdom, invention or empathy, non-transferable personal trust and leadership. As recognized in theories of economicsIndividual talent and initiative was recognized as an intangible quality of persons in economics back to at least Adam Smith.   He distinguished it (as "enterprise") from labour which can be coerced and is usually seen as strictly imitative (learned or transmitted, via such means as apprenticeship). 

Human capital<====>45804<====>Human capital  Human capital is a term popularized by Gary Becker, an economist from the University of Chicago, and Jacob Mincer  that refers to the stock of knowledge, habits, social and personality attributes, including creativity, embodied in the ability to perform labor so as to produce economic value.   The subject is closely associated with the study of human resources management as found in the practice of business administration and macroeconomics. HistoryArthur Lewis is said to have begun the field of  development economics and consequently the idea of human capital when he wrote in 1954   "Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labour. 

Instructional capital<====>45805<====>Instructional capital Instructional capital is a term used in educational administration after the 1960s, to reflect capital resulting from investment in producing learning materials. Some have objected to this phrasing, which is an elaboration of referring to training as "human capital", either for the same reason that phrase is objectionable, or on the grounds that it implies that the human in which the knowledge is "invested" is a resource to be exploited. Instructional capital can be used to guide or limit or restrict action by people (individual capital) or equipment (infrastructural capital) (if the learning materials are computer programs).   It cannot generally make either individuals or infrastructure do what they are not trained or designed to do, but it can help prevent them from doing most stupid, destructive and dangerous things. 

Garuda<====>45806<====>Garuda  The Garuda is a legendary bird or bird-like creature found in Hindu, Buddhist and Jain mythology. He is variously the vehicle mount (vahana) of the Hindu god Vishnu, a dhamma-protector and Astasena in Buddhism, and the Yaksha of the Jain Tirthankara Shantinatha.    Garuda is described as the king of birds and a Kite-like figure.    He is shown either in zoomorphic form (giant bird with partially open wings) or an anthropomorphic form (man with wings and some bird features).  Garuda is generally a protector with power to swiftly go anywhere, ever watchful and an enemy of the serpent. 

Financial capital<====>45807<====>Financial capital  Financial capital is any economic resource measured in terms of money used by entrepreneurs and businesses to buy what they need to make their products or to provide their services to the sector of the economy upon which their operation is based, i. e.  retail, corporate, investment banking, etc. Three concepts of capital maintenance authorized in IFRSFinancial capital or just capital/equity in finance, accounting and economics, is internal retained earnings generated by the entity or funds provided by lenders (and investors) to businesses to purchase real capital equipment or services for producing new goods/services.  Real capital or economic capital comprises physical goods that assist in the production of other goods and services, e. 

Dijkstra's algorithm<====>45809<====>Dijkstra's algorithm   Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.   It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W.  Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.   The algorithm exists in many variants; Dijkstra's original variant found the shortest path between two nodes,  but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree. 

Subwoofer<====>45810<====>SubwooferA subwoofer (or sub) is a woofer, or a complete loudspeaker, which is dedicated to the reproduction of low-pitched audio frequencies known as bass.  The typical frequency range for a subwoofer is about 20–200 Hz for consumer products,    below 100 Hz for professional live sound,  and below 80 Hz in THX-approved systems.Subwoofers are intended to augment the low frequency range of loudspeakers covering higher frequency bands.  While the term "subwoofer" technically only refers to the speaker driver, in common parlance, the term often refers to a subwoofer driver mounted in a speaker enclosure (cabinet). 

Eponym<====>45811<====>Eponym  An eponym is a person, place, or thing after whom or after which something is named, or believed to be named.  The adjectives derived from eponym include eponymous and eponymic.  For example, Elizabeth I of England is the eponym of the Elizabethan era, and "the eponymous founder of the Ford Motor Company" refers to Henry Ford.   Recent usage, especially in the recorded-music industry, also allows eponymous to mean "named after its central character or creator".   HistoryPeriods have often been named after a ruler or other influential figure:One of the first recorded cases of eponymy occurred in the second millennium BC, when the Assyrians named each year after a high official (limmu). 

Pim Fortuyn<====>45812<====>Pim Fortuyn  Wilhelmus Simon Petrus Fortuijn, known as Pim Fortuyn ( ; 19 February 1948 – 6 May 2002), was a Dutch politician, civil servant, sociologist, author and professor who formed his own party, Pim Fortuyn List (Lijst Pim Fortuyn or LPF) in 2002.

Structural engineering<====>45829<====>Structural engineeringStructural engineering is a sub-discipline of civil engineering in which structural engineers are trained to understand, predict, and calculate the stability, strength and rigidity of built structures for buildings  and nonbuilding structures, to develop designs and integrate their design with that of other designers, and to supervise construction of projects on site.   They can also be involved in the design of machinery, medical equipment, and vehicles where structural integrity affects functioning and safety.   See glossary of structural engineering. Structural engineering theory is based upon applied physical laws and empirical knowledge of the structural performance of different materials and geometries. 

Tetanus<====>45831<====>Tetanus   Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is an infection characterized by muscle spasms.   In the most common type, the spasms begin in the jaw and then progress to the rest of the body.   These spasms usually last a few minutes each time and occur frequently for three to four weeks.   Spasms may be so severe that bone fractures may occur.   Other symptoms may include fever, sweating, headache, trouble swallowing, high blood pressure, and a fast heart rate. Onset of symptoms is typically three to twenty-one days following infection. 

Gyrocompass<====>45832<====>Gyrocompass A gyrocompass is a type of non-magnetic compass which is based on a fast-spinning disc and the rotation of the Earth (or another planetary body if used elsewhere in the universe) to find geographical direction automatically.  Although one important component of a gyrocompass is a gyroscope, these are not the same devices; a gyrocompass is built to use the effect of gyroscopic precession, which is a distinctive aspect of the general gyroscopic effect.    Gyrocompasses are widely used for navigation on ships, because they have two significant advantages over magnetic compasses: they find true north as determined by the axis of the Earth's rotation, which is different from, and navigationally more useful than,  magnetic north, andthey are unaffected by ferromagnetic materials, such as in a ship's steel hull, which distort the magnetic field. 

Palatino<====>45833<====>Palatino   Palatino is the name of an old-style serif typeface designed by Hermann Zapf, initially released in 1949 by the Stempel foundry and later by other companies, most notably the Mergenthaler Linotype Company.  Named after 16th century Italian master of calligraphy Giambattista Palatino, Palatino is based on the humanist types of the Italian Renaissance, which mirror the letters formed by a broad nib pen; this gives a grace reflecting Zapf's expertise as a calligrapher.Its capital 'Y' is in the unusual 'palm Y' style, inspired by the Greek letter upsilon, a trait found in some of the earliest versions of the letter such as that of Aldus Manutius. 

Optima<====>45834<====>Optima  Optima is a humanist sans-serif typeface designed by Hermann Zapf and released by the D.  Stempel AG foundry, Frankfurt, Germany. Though classified as a sans-serif, Optima has a subtle swelling at the terminals suggesting a glyphic serif.  Optima was inspired by classical Roman capitals and the stonecarving on Renaissance-period tombstones Zapf saw in Florence on a 1950 holiday to Italy.    Zapf intended Optima to be a typeface that could serve for both body text and titling.  To prove its versatility, Zapf set his entire book About Alphabets in the regular weight.Zapf retained an interest in the design, collaborating on variants and expansions into his eighties. 

Hermann Zapf<====>45835<====>Hermann Zapf Hermann Zapf ( ; November 8, 1918 – June 4, 2015) was a German type designer and calligrapher who lived in Darmstadt, Germany.  He was married to the calligrapher and typeface designer Gudrun Zapf-von Hesse.  Typefaces he designed include Palatino, Optima and Zapfino. Early lifeZapf was born in Nuremberg  during turbulent times marked by the German Revolution of 1918–1919 in Munich and Berlin, the end of World War I, the exile of Kaiser Wilhelm, and the establishment of Bavaria as a free state by Kurt Eisner.  In addition, the Spanish flu pandemic took hold in Europe in 1918 and 1919. 

Drum machine<====>45839<====>Drum machine  A drum machine is an electronic musical instrument designed to imitate the sound of drums, cymbals, other percussion instruments and often basslines.  Drum machines are most commonly associated with electronic music genres such as house music, but are also used in many other genres.  They are usually used when session drummers are not available or if the production cannot afford the cost of a drummer.  Also, many modern drum machines can also produce unique sounds, as well as allowing the user to compose unique drum beats and patterns that might be difficult to perform by a human drummer. 

Voynich manuscript<====>45845<====>Voynich manuscript The Voynich manuscript is an illustrated codex hand-written in an unknown writing system.  The vellum on which it is written has been carbon-dated to the early 15th century (1404–1438), and it may have been composed in Northern Italy during the Italian Renaissance.    The manuscript is named after Wilfrid Voynich, a Polish book dealer who purchased it in 1912.  Some of the pages are missing, with around 240 remaining.  The text is written from left to right, and most of the pages have illustrations or diagrams.  Some pages are foldable sheets. The Voynich manuscript has been studied by many professional and amateur cryptographers, including American and British codebreakers from both World War I and World War II. 

Ferrara<====>45846<====>Ferrara  Ferrara (   ) (Emilian: Frara) is a town and comune in Emilia-Romagna, northern Italy, capital of the Province of Ferrara.  In 2016 it had 132,009 inhabitants.

Agritourism<====>45847<====>Agritourism Agritourism or agrotourism, as it is defined most broadly, involves any agriculturally based operation or activity that brings visitors to a farm or ranch.  Agritourism has different definitions in different parts of the world, and sometimes refers specifically to farm stays, as in Italy.  Elsewhere, agritourism includes a wide variety of activities, including buying produce direct from a farm stand, navigating a corn maze, slopping hogs, picking fruit, feeding animals, or staying at a bed and breakfast (B&B) on a farm.  Agritourism is a form of niche tourism that is considered a growth industry in many parts of the world, including Australia,  Canada,    the United States,    and the Philippines. 

Deep Purple<====>45848<====>Deep Purple    Deep Purple are   an English rock band formed in Hertford in 1968.   The band is considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock,  although their musical approach changed over the years.   Originally formed as a progressive rock band, the band shifted to a heavier sound in 1970.   Deep Purple, together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the "unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies". 

Chinese democracy movement<====>45849<====>Chinese democracy movement The Chinese democracy movement ( ), abbreviated as Minyun ( ), refers to a series of loosely organized political movements in the People's Republic of China against the continued one-party rule by the Communist Party.  One such movement began during the Beijing Spring in 1978 and was taken up again in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. History The origin of the Chinese movement started in 1978, when the brief liberalization known as Beijing Spring occurred after the Cultural Revolution.  The founding document of the movement is considered to be the Fifth Modernization manifesto by Wei Jingsheng, who was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for authoring the document. 

Opeth<====>45851<====>Opeth Opeth are a Swedish  heavy metal  band from Stockholm, formed in 1989.    The group has been through several personnel changes, but lead vocalist, guitarist and songwriter Mikael Åkerfeldt has remained Opeth's primary driving force throughout the years.  Opeth has consistently incorporated progressive, folk, blues, classical and jazz influences into its usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from death metal, especially in their early works.  Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts, as well as both death growls and clean vocals.  Opeth is also well known for their incorporation of Mellotrons in their work. 

Charles Ponzi<====>45852<====>Charles Ponzi   Charles Ponzi, (born Carlo Pietro Giovanni Guglielmo Tebaldo Ponzi; March 3, 1882 – January 18, 1949), was an Italian swindler and con artist in the U. S.  and Canada.  His aliases include Charles Ponci, Carlo, and Charles P.  Bianchi.    Born and raised in Italy, he became known in the early 1920s as a swindler in North America for his money-making scheme.  He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days, or 100% profit within 90 days, by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them at face value in the United States as a form of arbitrage. 

Uffizi<====>45854<====>Uffizi The Uffizi Gallery ( ,  ) is a prominent art museum located adjacent to the Piazza della Signoria in the Historic Centre of Florence in the region of Tuscany, Italy.  One of the most important Italian museums, and the most visited, it is also one of the largest and best known in the world, and holds a collection of priceless works, particularly from the period of the Italian Renaissance. After the ruling house of Medici died out, their art collections were gifted to the city of Florence under the famous Patto di famiglia negotiated by Anna Maria Luisa, the last Medici heiress. 

Monastery<====>45856<====>MonasteryA monastery is a building or complex of buildings comprising the domestic quarters and workplaces of monastics, monks or nuns, whether living in communities or alone (hermits).  A monastery generally includes a place reserved for prayer which may be a chapel, church or temple, and may also serve as an oratory. Monasteries vary greatly in size, comprising a small dwelling accommodating only a hermit, or in the case of communities anything from a single building housing only one senior and two or three junior monks or nuns, to vast complexes and estates housing tens or hundreds.  A monastery complex typically comprises a number of buildings which include a church, dormitory, cloister, refectory, library, balneary and infirmary. 

Hurwitz polynomial<====>45857<====>Hurwitz polynomialIn mathematics, a Hurwitz polynomial, named after Adolf Hurwitz, is a polynomial  whose roots (zeros) are located in the left half-plane of the complex plane or on the imaginary  axis, that is, the real part of every root is zero or negative. Such a polynomial must have coefficients that are positive real numbers.  The term is sometimes restricted to polynomials whose roots have real parts that are strictly negative, excluding the axis (i. e. , a Hurwitz stable polynomial).  A polynomial function P(s) of a complex variable s is said to be Hurwitz if the following conditions are satisfied:1. 

Intellectual capital<====>45858<====>Intellectual capitalIntellectual capital is the intangible value of a business, covering its people (human capital), the value inherent in its relationships (Relational capital), and everything that is left when the employees go home (Structural capital), of which Intellectual property (IP) is but one component.   It is the sum of everything everybody in a company knows that gives it a competitive edge.   The term is used in academia in an attempt to account for the value of intangible assets not listed explicitly on a company's balance sheets.   On a national level intellectual capital refers to National Intangible Capital NIC.

Raster image processor<====>45862<====>Raster image processor A raster image processor (RIP) is a component used in a printing system which produces a raster image also known as a bitmap.  Such a bitmap is used by a later stage of the printing system to produce the printed output.  The input may be a page description in a high-level page description language such as PostScript, Portable Document Format, XPS or another bitmap of higher or lower resolution than the output device.  In the latter case, the RIP applies either smoothing or interpolation algorithms to the input bitmap to generate the output bitmap.

Ladin language<====>45870<====>Ladin language Ladin (   or  ;  Ladin: Ladin,  ,  ) is a Romance language consisting of a group of dialects that some consider part of a unitary Rhaeto-Romance language,  mainly spoken in the Dolomite Mountains in Northern Italy in the provinces of South Tyrol, the Trentino, and the Belluno, by the Ladin people.  It exhibits similarities to Swiss Romansh and Friulian. The precise extension of the Ladin language area is the subject of scholarly debates.  A more narrow perspective includes only the dialects of the valleys around the Sella group, while wider definitions comprise the dialects of adjacent valleys in the Province of Belluno and even dialects spoken in the northwestern Trentino. 

Loudspeaker<====>45871<====>Loudspeaker A loudspeaker (or loud-speaker or speaker) is an electroacoustic transducer;    which converts an electrical audio signal into a corresponding sound. The most widely used type of speaker in the 2010s is the dynamic speaker, invented in 1925 by Edward W.  Kellogg and Chester W.  Rice.   The dynamic speaker operates on the same basic principle as a dynamic microphone, but in reverse, to produce sound from an electrical signal.  When an alternating current electrical audio signal is applied to its voice coil, a coil of wire suspended in a circular gap between the poles of a permanent magnet, the coil is forced to move rapidly back and forth due to Faraday's law of induction, which causes a diaphragm (usually conically shaped) attached to the coil to move back and forth, pushing on the air to create sound waves. 

Assured destruction<====>45873<====>Assured destruction In military strategy, assured destruction is where behaviors or choices are deterred because they will lead to overwhelming punitive consequences.  It was most often discussed as mutually assured destruction (MAD), assuming there are exactly two parties in the conflict.  The concept of assured destruction occasionally arises also in the death penalty debate and biotechnology debate. For an assured destruction strategy to be successfulthe threat must be known in advance,the threat must be credible both in the opponent’s ability and moral willingness,the target of the strategy must behave based on rational self-interest to the extent that the threat will be effective in preventing the behavior. 

Pre-emptive nuclear strike<====>45876<====>Pre-emptive nuclear strike   In nuclear strategy, a first strike is a preemptive surprise attack employing overwhelming force.  First strike capability is a country's ability to defeat another nuclear power by destroying its arsenal to the point where the attacking country can survive the weakened retaliation while the opposing side is left unable to continue war.  The preferred methodology is to attack the opponent's strategic nuclear weapon facilities (missile silos, submarine bases, bomber airfields), command and control sites, and storage depots first.  The strategy is called counterforce. Overview During the Cold War period, both superpowers, NATO and the Eastern Bloc, built massive nuclear arsenals, aimed, to a large extent, at each other. 

Line printer<====>45879<====>Line printer   A line printer prints one entire line of text before advancing to another line. Most but not all early line printers were impact printers. Line printers are mostly associated with unit record equipment and the early days of digital computing, but the technology is still in use.   Print speeds of 600 lines-per-minute    (approximately 10 pages per minute) were achieved in the 1950s, later increasing to as much as 1200 lpm.  Line printers print a complete line at a time and have speeds in the range of 150 to 2500 lines per minute. 

Trento<====>45882<====>Trento    Trento(anglicized as Trent;    local dialects: Trènt;  ) is a city on the Adige River in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol in Italy.  It is the capital of Trentino.  In the 16th century, the city was the location of the Council of Trent.  Formerly part of Austria and Austria-Hungary, it was annexed by Italy in 1919. Trento is an educational, scientific, financial and political centre in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, in Tyrol and Northern Italy in general.  The University of Trento ranks highly out of Italy's top 30 colleges, coming 1st in the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research ranking,    1st according to Census ranking    and 5th in the Il Sole 24 Ore ranking of Italian universities. 

Cathedral<====>45883<====>Cathedral   A cathedral is a Christian church which contains the seat of a bishop,  thus serving as the central church of a diocese, conference, or episcopate.   The counterpart term for such a church in German is Dom from Latin domus ecclesiae or domus episcopalis; also Italian Duomo, Dutch Domkerk and cognates in many other European languages.  Churches with the function of "cathedral" are usually specific to those Christian denominations with an episcopal hierarchy, such as the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox, and some Lutheran and Methodist churches.  New Standard Encyclopedia, 1992 by Standard Educational Corporation, Chicago, Illinois; page B-262c   Church buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appear in Italy, Gaul, Spain and North Africa in the 4th century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the 12th century, by which time they had developed architectural forms, institutional structures and legal identities distinct from parish churches, monastic churches and episcopal residences.

Fermat pseudoprime<====>45891<====>Fermat pseudoprimeIn number theory, the Fermat pseudoprimes make up the most important class of pseudoprimes that come from Fermat's little theorem. DefinitionFermat's little theorem states that if p is prime and a is coprime to p, then a p−1  − 1 is divisible by p.  For an integer a > 1, if a composite integer x divides a x−1  − 1, then x is called a Fermat pseudoprime to base a.  In other words, a composite integer is a Fermat pseudoprime to base a if it successfully passes the Fermat primality test for the base a.It follows that if x is a Fermat pseudoprime to base a, then x is coprime to a.

The Man in the High Castle won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1963.  Beginning in 2015, the book was adapted as a multi-season TV series, with Dick's daughter, Isa Dick Hackett, serving as one of the show's producers. 

Exponential distribution<====>45906<====>Exponential distribution  In probability theory and statistics, the exponential distribution (also known as negative exponential distribution) is the probability distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson point process, i. e.  a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate.  It is a particular case of the gamma distribution.  It is the continuous analogue of the geometric distribution, and it has the key property of being memoryless.  In addition to being used for the analysis of Poisson point processes it is found in various other contexts. The exponential distribution is not the same as the class of exponential families of distributions, which is a large class of probability distributions that includes the exponential distribution as one of its members, but also includes the normal distribution, binomial distribution, gamma distribution, Poisson, and many others. 

Beyond This Horizon<====>45907<====>Beyond This Horizon Beyond This Horizon is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A.  Heinlein.  It was originally published as a two-part serial in Astounding Science Fiction (April, May 1942, under the pseudonym Anson MacDonald) and then as a single volume by Fantasy Press in 1948.

Space Cadet<====>45912<====>Space Cadet  Space Cadet is a 1948 science fiction novel by Robert A.  Heinlein about Matt Dodson, who joins the Space Patrol to help preserve peace in the Solar System.  The story translates the standard military academy story into outer space: a boy from Iowa goes to officer school, sees action and adventure, shoulders responsibilities far beyond his experience, and becomes a man.  It was published as the second of the series of Heinlein juveniles and inspired the Tom Corbett, Space Cadet media empire, including the 1950s television series and radio show which made "Space Cadet" a household phrase whose meaning later shifted in popular culture. 

Humpty Dumpty<====>45915<====>Humpty DumptyHumpty Dumpty is a character in an English nursery rhyme, probably originally a riddle and one of the best known in the English-speaking world.  He is typically portrayed as a personified egg, though he is not explicitly described as such.  The first recorded versions of the rhyme date from late eighteenth-century England and the tune from 1870 in James William Elliott's National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs.

Since his uncle had been a member of the Astrogators Guild and had had no children, Max hopes that before he died, his uncle had named him his heir. 

Geometric distribution<====>45922<====>Geometric distribution In probability theory and statistics, the geometric distribution is either of two discrete probability distributions:The probability distribution of the number X of Bernoulli trials needed to get one success, supported on the set { 1, 2, 3, . . . }The probability distribution of the number Y = X − 1 of failures before the first success, supported on the set { 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .  }Which of these one calls "the" geometric distribution is a matter of convention and convenience. These two different geometric distributions should not be confused with each other.  Often, the name shifted geometric distribution is adopted for the former one (distribution of the number X); however, to avoid ambiguity, it is considered wise to indicate which is intended, by mentioning the support explicitly. 

Podkayne of Mars<====>45927<====>Podkayne of Mars   Podkayne of Mars is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A.  Heinlein, originally serialised in Worlds of If (November 1962, January, March 1963), and published in hardcover in 1963.  The novel is about a teenage girl named Podkayne "Poddy" Fries and her younger, asocial genius brother, Clark, who leave their home on Mars to take a trip on a spaceliner to visit Earth, accompanied by their uncle. This book and Starship Troopers were written for a publisher expecting to market a juvenile science fiction novel, and both raised serious objections from the publisher.

Spirit possession<====>45936<====>Spirit possession  Spirit possession is a term for the belief that animas, aliens, demons, extraterrestrials, gods, or spirits can take control of a human body.  The concept of spirit possession exists in many religions, including Christianity, Mark 5:9, Luke 8:30  Buddhism, Haitian Vodou, Wicca, Hinduism, Islam and Southeast Asian and African traditions.  In a 1969 study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, spirit possession beliefs were found to exist in 74% of a sample of 488 societies in all parts of the world.   Depending on the cultural context in which it is found, possession may be considered voluntary or involuntary and may be considered to have beneficial or detrimental effects on the host. 

General equilibrium theory<====>45938<====>General equilibrium theory In economics, general equilibrium theory attempts to explain the behavior of supply, demand, and prices in a whole economy with several or many interacting markets, by seeking to prove that the interaction of demand and supply will result in an overall general equilibrium.  General equilibrium theory contrasts to the theory of partial equilibrium, which only analyzes single markets. General equilibrium theory both studies economies using the model of equilibrium pricing and seeks to determine in which circumstances the assumptions of general equilibrium will hold.  The theory dates to the 1870s, particularly the work of French economist Léon Walras in his pioneering 1874 work Elements of Pure Economics. 

Primary color<====>45939<====>Primary color A set of primary colors is, most tangibly, a set of real physical pigmented media or colored lights that can be combined in varying amounts to produce a "gamut" of colors.  This is the essential method used in applications that are intended to elicit the perception of diverse sets of color, e. g.  electronic displays, color printing, and paintings.  Perceptions associated with a given combination of primary colors are predicted by applying the appropriate mixing model (additive, subtractive, additive averaging etc. ) that embodies the underlying physics of how light interacts with the media and ultimately the retina. 

Swastika<====>45943<====>Swastika   The swastika (as a character 卐 or 卍) is an ancient religious icon used in the Indian subcontinent, East Asia and Southeast Asia, where it has been and remains a sacred symbol of spiritual principles in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.   In the Western world, it was historically a symbol of auspiciousness and good luck,  but in the 1930s, it became the main feature of Nazi symbolism as an emblem of Aryan race identity, and as a result, it has become stigmatized in the West by association with ideas of racism, hatred, and mass murder. 

Lower Canada<====>45945<====>Lower Canada  The Province of Lower Canada ( ) was a British colony on the lower Saint Lawrence River and the shores of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence (1791–1841).  It covered the southern portion of the modern-day Province of Quebec, Canada, and the Labrador region of the modern-day Province of Newfoundland and Labrador (until the Labrador region was transferred to Newfoundland in 1809).    Lower Canada consisted of part of the former colony of Canada of New France, which was ceded to Great Britain in 1763 after that Empire's victory in the Seven Years' War (also called the French and Indian War in the United States. 

Saint Lawrence River<====>45948<====>Saint Lawrence River  The Saint Lawrence River ( ; Tuscarora: Kahnawáʼkye;  Mohawk: Kaniatarowanenneh, meaning "big waterway") is a large river in the middle latitudes of North America.  The Saint Lawrence River flows in a roughly north-easterly direction, connecting the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean and forming the primary drainage outflow of the Great Lakes Basin.  It traverses the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario, and is part of the international boundary between Ontario, Canada, and the U. S.  state of New York.  This river also provides the basis of the commercial Saint Lawrence Seaway.

Minimal deterrence<====>45951<====>Minimal deterrenceIn nuclear strategy, minimal deterrence (also called minimum deterrence) is an application of deterrence theory in which a state possesses no more nuclear weapons than is necessary to deter an adversary from attacking.  Kristensen, Norris and Oelrich 2009, 21   Pure minimal deterrence is a doctrine of no first use, holding that the only mission of nuclear weapons is to deter a nuclear adversary by making the cost of a first strike unacceptably high.    To present a credible deterrent, there must be the assurance that any attack would trigger a retaliatory strike.    In other words, minimal deterrence requires rejecting a counterforce strategy in favor of pursuing survivable force that can be used in a countervalue second strike. 

Clanging<====>45955<====>ClangingIn psychology and psychiatry, clanging refers to a mode of speech characterized by association of words based upon sound rather than concepts.  For example, this may include compulsive rhyming or alliteration without apparent logical connection between words.  This is associated with the irregular thinking apparent in psychotic mental illnesses (e. g.  mania and schizophrenia).   Gustav Aschaffenburg found that manic individuals generated these "clang-associations" roughly 10-50 times more than non-manic individuals.   Aschaffenburg also found that the frequency of these associations increased for all individuals as they became more fatigued.  Clanging refers specifically to behavior that is situationally inappropriate. 

Mutual assured destruction<====>45958<====>Mutual assured destruction  Mutual assured destruction or mutually assured destruction (MAD) is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender (see pre-emptive nuclear strike and second strike).   It is based on the theory of deterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy's use of those same weapons.  The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm. 

Nuclear strategy<====>45959<====>Nuclear strategy    Nuclear strategy involves the development of doctrines and strategies for the production and use of nuclear weapons. As a sub-branch of military strategy, nuclear strategy attempts to match nuclear weapons as means to political ends.  In addition to the actual use of nuclear weapons whether in the battlefield or strategically, a large part of nuclear strategy involves their use as a bargaining tool. Some of the issues considered within nuclear strategy include:Under what conditions does it serve a nation's interest to develop nuclear weapons?What types of nuclear weapons should be developed?When and how should such weapons be used?Many strategists argue that nuclear strategy differs from other forms of military strategy. 

Cloaking device<====>45960<====>Cloaking device  A cloaking device is a theoretical or fictional stealth technology that can cause objects, such as spaceships or individuals, to be partially or wholly invisible to parts of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum.  However, over the entire spectrum, a cloaked object scatters more than an uncloaked object.    Fictional cloaking devices have been used as plot devices in various media for many years. Developments in scientific research show that real-world cloaking devices can obscure objects from at least one wavelength of EM emissions.  Scientists already use artificial materials called metamaterials to bend light around an object. 

Analytic language<====>45963<====>Analytic language In linguistic typology, an analytic language is a language that primarily conveys relationships between words in sentences by way of helper words (particles, prepositions, etc. ) and word order, as opposed to utilizing inflections (changing the form of a word to convey its role in the sentence).  For example, in English the phrase "The cat chases the ball" conveys the fact that the cat is acting on the ball analytically via word order.  This can be contrasted to synthetic languages that rely heavily on inflections to convey word relationships (e. g.  the phrases "The cat chases the ball" and "The cat chased the ball" convey different time frames via changing the form of the word chase). 

Chuck Berry<====>45964<====>Chuck Berry   Charles Edward Anderson Berry (October 18, 1926 – March 18, 2017) was an American singer, songwriter, musician, and one of the pioneers of rock and roll music.  With songs such as "Maybellene" (1955), "Roll Over Beethoven" (1956), "Rock and Roll Music" (1957) and "Johnny B.  Goode" (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive.  Writing lyrics that focused on teen life and consumerism, and developing a music style that included guitar solos and showmanship, Berry was a major influence on subsequent rock music. 

No first use<====>45966<====>No first useNo first use (NFU) refers to a pledge or a policy by a nuclear power not to use nuclear weapons as a means of warfare unless first attacked by an adversary using nuclear weapons.  Earlier, the concept had also been applied to chemical and biological warfare. China declared its NFU policy in 1964, and has since maintained this policy.  India articulated its policy of no first use of nuclear weapons in 2003.  NATO has repeatedly rejected calls for adopting NFU policy,  arguing that pre-emptive nuclear strike is a key option, in order to have a credible deterrent that could compensate for the overwhelming conventional weapon superiority enjoyed by the Soviet Army in the Eurasian land mass. 

Richard Burton<====>45967<====>Richard BurtonRichard Burton, CBE ( ; born Richard Walter Jenkins Jr. ; 10 November 1925 5 August 1984) was a Welsh actor  who was noted for his mellifluous baritone voice. Burton established himself as a formidable Shakespearean actor in the 1950s, and he gave a memorable performance of Hamlet in 1964.  He was called "the natural successor to Olivier" by critic and dramaturge Kenneth Tynan.  An alcoholic,  Burton's failure to live up to those expectations    disappointed critics and colleagues and fueled his legend as a great thespian wastrel. 

Tom Jones (singer)<====>45968<====>Tom Jones (singer)    Sir Thomas John Woodward  OBE (born 7 June 1940), also known by his stage name Tom Jones, is a Welsh singer.  His career has spanned six decades, from his emergence as a vocalist in the mid-1960s with a string of top hits, regular touring, appearances in Las Vegas (1967–2011), and career comebacks—to coaching on The Voice UK from 2012 (with the exception of 2016).Jones's powerful voice has been described as a "full-throated, robust baritone".    His performing range has included pop, rock, R&B, show tunes, country, dance, soul and gospel. 

Joan Crawford<====>45969<====>Joan Crawford   Joan Crawford (born Lucille Fay LeSueur; March 23, c.  1904  – May 10, 1977) was an American film and television actress who began her career as a dancer and stage showgirl.  In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Crawford tenth on its list of the greatest female stars of Classic Hollywood Cinema. Beginning her career as a dancer in traveling theatrical companies, before debuting as a chorus girl on Broadway, Crawford signed a motion picture contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1925.  In the 1930s, Crawford's fame rivaled, and later outlasted, MGM colleagues Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo. 

Pentecost<====>45971<====>Pentecost  The Christian holiday of Pentecost, which is celebrated on the seventh Sunday (49 days) after Easter, commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus Christ while they were in Jerusalem celebrating the Feast of Weeks, as described in the Acts of the Apostles ( ).  Christians believe this event represents the birth of the Church. In Eastern Christianity, Pentecost can also refer to the entire fifty days of Easter through Pentecost inclusive; hence the book containing the liturgical texts for Paschaltide is called the "Pentecostarion".  Since its date depends on the date of Easter, Pentecost is a moveable feast. 

Whatì<====>45975<====>Whatì Whatì  (from the Dogrib language meaning "Marten Lakes"), officially the Tłı̨chǫ Community Government of Whatì  is a First Nations community in the North Slave Region of the Northwest Territories, Canada.  Whatì is located by Lac La Martre, about   northwest of the territorial capital of Yellowknife. HistoryWith rich and varied wildlife, the area has long been a favoured hunting ground of the Tłı̨chǫ (Dogrib Dene) Aboriginal people.  The North West Company established a trading post there in 1793, and many natives began settling there permanently, while they continued to hunt and fish in the area. 

Compromise of 1850<====>45976<====>Compromise of 1850The Compromise of 1850 was a package of five separate bills passed by the United States Congress in September 1850, which defused a four-year political confrontation between slave and free states on the status of territories acquired during the Mexican–American War (1846–1848).  The compromise, drafted by Whig Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky and brokered by Clay and Democratic Senator Stephen Douglas of Illinois, reduced sectional conflict.  Controversy arose over the Fugitive Slave provision.  The Compromise was greeted with relief, but each side disliked some of its specific provisions:Texas surrendered its claim to New Mexico as well as its claims north of 36°30'. 

Victoria Beckham<====>45979<====>Victoria BeckhamVictoria Caroline Beckham,   (  Adams; born 17 April 1974)  is an English businesswoman, fashion designer, model, and singer.  In the late 1990s, Beckham rose to fame with the all-female pop group Spice Girls, and was dubbed Posh Spice by the July 1996 issue of the British music magazine Top of the Pops.   After the Spice Girls split, she was signed to Virgin Records and Telstar Records and had four UK Top 10 singles.  Her first release, "Out of Your Mind", reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart. 

George Michael<====>45985<====>George Michael    Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou (25 June 1963 – 25 December 2016), known professionally as George Michael, was an English singer, songwriter, record producer, and philanthropist who rose to fame as a member of the music duo Wham! He was best known for his work in the 1980s and 1990s, including hit singles such as "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go" and "Last Christmas", and albums such as Faith (1987) and Listen Without Prejudice Vol.  1 (1990). Up to the time of his death, Michael sold more than 115 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. 

Grandfather paradox<====>45990<====>Grandfather paradox The grandfather paradox is a paradox of time travel in which inconsistencies emerge through changing the past.The name comes from the paradox's common description: a person travels to the past and kills their own grandfather before the conception of their father or mother, which prevents the time traveler's existence.Despite its title, the grandfather paradox does not exclusively regard the contradiction of killing one's own grandfather to prevent one's birth.  Rather, the paradox regards any action that alters the past,    since there is a contradiction whenever the past becomes different from the way it was. 

Building<====>45995<====>Building   A building or edifice is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place, such as a house or factory.   Buildings come in a variety of sizes, shapes and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors, from building materials available, to weather conditions, to land prices, ground conditions, specific uses and aesthetic reasons.  To better understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures. Buildings serve several societal needs – primarily as shelter from weather, security, living space, privacy, to store belongings, and to comfortably live and work.

He was a prominent figure of the Revolution of 1848 in Moldavia.  He initiated a series of reforms that contributed to the modernization of Romanian society and of state structures. Early lifeBorn in Bârlad, Cuza belonged to the traditional boyar class in Moldavia, being the son of Ispravnic Ioan Cuza (who was also a landowner in Fălciu County) and his wife Sultana (or Soltana), a member of the Cozadini family of Phanariote origins. 

Web browser engine<====>46001<====>Web browser engine A web browser engine, also called a layout engine, is a computer program that renders web pages.  It is not a stand-alone program but a core component of larger programs, primarily web browsers. Technical operationThe first web browsers were monolithic programs, but browser developers soon adopted a modular approach, splitting browsers into several large components:The host application embeds the other browser components and serves as the interface between them, the user, and the host operating system.  The host application includes the GUI surrounding the web page content, such as the tab bar, the address bar, and bookmark manager.

(Latin for "American Peace", modeled after Pax Romana, Pax Britannica, and Pax Mongolica) is a term applied to the concept of relative peace in the Western Hemisphere and later the world beginning around the middle of the 20th century, thought to be caused by the preponderance of power enjoyed by the United States. 

Common Language Runtime<====>46003<====>Common Language Runtime  The Common Language Runtime (CLR), the virtual machine component of Microsoft's . NET framework, manages the execution of . NET programs.  A process known as just-in-time compilation converts compiled code into machine instructions which the computer's CPU then executes.The CLR provides additional services including memory management, type safety, exception handling, garbage collection, security and thread management.  All programs written for the . NET framework, regardless of programming language, are executed by the CLR.  All versions of the . NET framework include CLR. CLR implements the Virtual Execution System (VES) as defined in the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) standard, initially developed by Microsoft itself. 

Common Intermediate Language<====>46004<====>Common Intermediate Language   Common Intermediate Language (CIL), formerly called Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL), is the lowest-level human-readable programming language defined by the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) specification and is used by the . NET Framework and Mono.  Languages which target a CLI-compatible runtime environment compile to CIL, which is assembled into an object code that has a bytecode-style format.  CIL is an object-oriented assembly language, and is entirely stack-based.  Its bytecode is translated into native code or—most commonly—executed by a virtual machine. CIL was originally known as Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) during the beta releases of the . 

Freedom of religion<====>46006<====>Freedom of religion   Freedom of religion is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance.  It also includes the freedom to change one's religion or belief.  Freedom of religion is considered by many people and most of the nations to be a fundamental human right.    In a country with a state religion, freedom of religion is generally considered to mean that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not persecute believers in other faiths. 

Moldavia<====>46007<====>Moldavia    Moldavia ( ,   or   (in Romanian Latin alphabet),   (in old Romanian Cyrillic alphabet)) is a historical region and former principality in Eastern Europe, corresponding to the territory between the Eastern Carpathians and the Dniester River.  An initially independent and later autonomous state, it existed from the 14th century to 1859, when it united with Wallachia ( ) as the basis of the modern Romanian state; at various times, Moldavia included the regions of Bessarabia (with the Budjak), all of Bukovina and Hertza.  The western half of Moldavia is now part of Romania, the eastern side belongs to the Republic of Moldova, while the northern and southeastern parts are territories of Ukraine.

Rambouillet Agreement<====>46021<====>Rambouillet Agreement  The Rambouillet Agreement was a proposed peace agreement between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and a delegation representing the Albanian majority population of Kosovo.  It was drafted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and named for the Château de Rambouillet, where it was initially proposed.  The significance of the agreement lies in the fact that Yugoslavia refused to accept it, which NATO used as justification to start the Kosovo War.  Belgrade's rejection was based on the argument that the agreement contained provisions for Kosovo's autonomy that went further than the Serbian/Yugoslav government saw as reasonable. 

Speaker of the United States House of Representatives<====>46023<====>Speaker of the United States House of Representatives    The Speaker of the House is the presiding officer of the United States House of Representatives.  The office was established in 1789 by Article I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution.  The Speaker is the political and parliamentary leader of the House of Representatives, and is simultaneously the House's presiding officer, leader of the body's majority party, and the institution's administrative head.  Speakers also perform various other administrative and procedural functions.  Given these several roles and responsibilities, the Speaker usually does not personally preside over debates. 

Abraham Robinson<====>46024<====>Abraham Robinson  Abraham Robinson (born Robinsohn;  October 6, 1918 – April 11, 1974) was a mathematician who is most widely known for development of non-standard analysis, a mathematically rigorous system whereby infinitesimal and infinite numbers were reincorporated into modern mathematics.  Nearly half of Robinson's papers were in applied mathematics rather than in pure mathematics.  BiographyHe was born to a Jewish family with strong Zionist beliefs, in Waldenburg, Germany, which is now Wałbrzych, in Poland.  In 1933, he emigrated to British Mandate of Palestine, where he earned a first degree from the Hebrew University.  Robinson was in France when the Nazis invaded during World War II, and escaped by train and on foot, being alternately questioned by French soldiers suspicious of his German passport and asked by them to share his map, which was more detailed than theirs. 

Omnipotence paradox<====>46025<====>Omnipotence paradox  The omnipotence paradox is a family of paradoxes that arise with some understandings of the term 'omnipotent'.  The paradox arises, for example, if one assumes that an omnipotent being has no limits and is capable of realizing any outcome, even logically contradictory ideas such as creating square circles.  A no-limits understanding of omnipotence such as this has been rejected by theologians from  Thomas Aquinas to contemporary philosophers of religion, such as Alvin Plantinga.Atheological arguments based on the omnipotence paradox are sometimes described as evidence for atheism, though Christian theologians and philosophers, such as Norman Geisler and William Lane Craig contend that a no-limits understanding of 'omnipotence' is not relevant to orthodox Christian theology. 

Wallachia<====>46026<====>Wallachia  Wallachia or Walachia (   ; archaic:  , Romanian Cyrillic alphabet:  ) is a historical and geographical region of Romania.  It is situated north of the Lower Danube and south of the Southern Carpathians.  Wallachia is traditionally divided into two sections, Muntenia (Greater Wallachia) and Oltenia (Lesser Wallachia).  Wallachia as a whole is sometimes referred to as Muntenia through identification with the larger of the two traditional sections. Wallachia was founded as a principality in the early 14th century by Basarab I, after a rebellion against Charles I of Hungary, although the first mention of the territory of Wallachia west of the river Olt dates to a charter given to the voivode Seneslau in 1246 by Béla IV of Hungary. 

Gerhard Gentzen<====>46027<====>Gerhard Gentzen Gerhard Karl Erich Gentzen (November 24, 1909 – August 4, 1945) was a German mathematician and logician.  He made major contributions to the foundations of mathematics, proof theory, especially on natural deduction and sequent calculus.  He died in 1945 after the Second World War, because he was deprived of food after being arrested in Prague. Life and careerGentzen was a student of Paul Bernays at the University of Göttingen.  Bernays was fired as "non-Aryan" in April 1933 and therefore Hermann Weyl formally acted as his supervisor.  Gentzen joined the Sturmabteilung in November 1933 although he was by no means compelled to do so. 

Wisdom<====>46029<====>Wisdom Wisdom or  sapience is the ability to think and act using knowledge, experience, understanding, common sense, and insight.   There appears to be consensus that wisdom is associated with attributes such as compassion, experiential self-knowledge, non-attachment and virtues such as ethics and benevolence.Wisdom has been defined in many different ways, a variety of measurement scales have been developed, and several subtypes of wisdom have been proposed.Out of these, phronesis and sophia are two key subtypes of wisdom.   In the classical Greek tradition, there is a distinction between sophia "wisdom" and phronesis "prudence, practical intelligence".

Porpoise<====>46037<====>PorpoisePorpoises are a group of fully aquatic marine mammals that are sometimes referred to as mereswine,  all of which are classified under the family Phocoenidae, parvorder Odontoceti (toothed whales).  There are six extant species of porpoise.  They are small toothed whales that are very closely related to oceanic dolphins.  The most obvious visible difference between the two groups is that porpoises have shorter beaks and flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins.  Porpoises, and other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged from them about 40 million years ago. 

Jeremy Bentham<====>46038<====>Jeremy Bentham    Jeremy Bentham ( ; 15 February 1748 [ O. S.  4 February 1747]  – 6 June 1832) was an English philosopher, jurist, and social reformer regarded as the founder of modern utilitarianism.   Bentham defined as the "fundamental axiom" of his philosophy the principle that "it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong".    He became a leading theorist in Anglo-American philosophy of law, and a political radical whose ideas influenced the development of welfarism.  He advocated for individual and economic freedoms, the separation of church and state, freedom of expression, equal rights for women, the right to divorce, and the decriminalising of homosexual acts. 

Pen name<====>46043<====>Pen nameA pen name (nom de plume, or literary double) is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their "real" name.  A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. 

Political economy<====>46044<====>Political economy  Political economy is the study of production and trade and their relations with law, custom and government as well as with the distribution of national income and wealth.  Political economy as a discipline originated in moral philosophy in the 18th century and sought to explore the administration of states' wealth, with "political" signifying the Greek word polity and "economy" signifying the Greek word "okonomie" or "household management".  The earliest works of political economy are most often attributed to British scholars like Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus and David Ricardo, although the case is sometimes made that the still earlier works of the French physiocrats constitute the true beginnings of the discipline.

Halteres<====>46080<====>Halteres  In dipterous insects, halteres ( ; singular halter or haltere) are minute dumbbell-shaped organs which have been modified from hindwings to provide a means of encoding body rotations during flight.Halteres are rapidly oscillated simultaneously with the wings, allowing them to experience forces resulting from body rotations.If the body of the insect rotates about one of its three axes (yaw, pitch or roll), the rotation exerts a force on the vibrating halteres – this is known as the Coriolis effect (see below).  The insect detects this force with sensory organs called campaniform sensilla and chordotonal organs located at the base of the halteres  and uses this information to interpret and correct its position in space. 

Halley's Comet<====>46083<====>Halley's CometHalley's Comet or Comet Halley , officially designated 1P/Halley,  is a short-period comet visible from Earth every 74–79 years.

Russell's paradox<====>46095<====>Russell's paradox In the foundations of mathematics, Russell's paradox (also known as Russell's antinomy), discovered by Bertrand Russell in 1901, showed that some attempted formalizations of the naïve set theory created by Georg Cantor led to a contradiction.  The same paradox had been discovered a year before by Ernst Zermelo but he did not publish the idea, which remained known only to David Hilbert, Edmund Husserl, and other members of the University of Göttingen.  According to naive set theory, any definable collection is a set.  Let R be the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. 

Simpson's paradox<====>46096<====>Simpson's paradoxSimpson's paradox, or the Yule–Simpson effect, is a phenomenon in probability and statistics, in which a trend appears in several different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined.

The Philosophy of Logical Atomism, reprinted in The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell, 1914-19, Vol 8. , p.  228  It shows that an apparently plausible scenario is logically impossible.  Specifically, it describes a barber who is defined such that he both shaves himself and does not shave himself. Paradox  The barber is the "one who shaves all those, and those only, who do not shave themselves.

Range encoding<====>46120<====>Range encodingRange encoding is an entropy coding method defined by G.  Nigel N.  Martin in a 1979 paper, G.  Nigel N.  Martin, Range encoding: An algorithm for removing redundancy from a digitized message, Video & Data Recording Conference, Southampton, UK, July 24–27, 1979.   which effectively rediscovered the FIFO arithmetic code first introduced by Richard Clark Pasco in 1976.   Given a stream of symbols and their probabilities, a range coder produces a space efficient stream of bits to represent these symbols and, given the stream and the probabilities, a range decoder reverses the process. Range coding is very similar to arithmetic encoding, except that encoding is done with digits in any base, instead of with bits, and so it is faster when using larger bases (e.

Invasion of Normandy<====>46128<====>Invasion of NormandyThe Western Allies of World War II launched the largest amphibious invasion in history when they assaulted Normandy, located on the northern coast of France, on 6 June 1944.  The invaders were able to establish a beachhead as part of Operation Overlord after a successful "D-Day," the first day of the invasion. Allied land forces came from the United States, Britain, Canada, and Free French forces.  In the weeks following the invasion, Polish forces and contingents from Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece and the Netherlands participated in the ground campaign; most also provided air and naval support alongside elements of the Royal Australian Air Force, the Royal New Zealand Air Force, and the Royal Norwegian Navy. 

ITV Digital<====>46129<====>ITV Digital    ITV Digital was a British digital terrestrial television broadcaster which launched a pay-TV service on the world's first digital terrestrial television network.  Its main shareholders were Carlton Communications and Granada plc, two franchises of the ITV network.  Starting as ONdigital in 1998, the service was re-branded as ITV Digital in July 2001.  Low audience figures and an ultimately unaffordable multimillion-pound deal with the Football League led to the broadcaster suffering massive losses.  These forced it to enter administration in March 2002.  The service ceased permanently in June 2002, with the terrestrial multiplexes subsequently taken over by Crown Castle and the BBC to create Freeview in October 2002. 

Rennes<====>46132<====>Rennes   Rennes ( ;  ,  ; Gallo: Resnn;  ) is a city in the east of Brittany in northwestern France at the confluence of the Ille and the Vilaine.  Rennes is the capital of the region of Brittany, as well as the Ille-et-Vilaine department. Rennes's history goes back more than 2,000 years, at a time when it was a small Gallic village named Condate.  Together with Vannes and Nantes, it was one of the major cities of the ancient Duchy of Brittany.  From the early sixteenth century until the French Revolution, Rennes was a parliamentary, administrative and garrison city of the historic province of Brittany of the Kingdom of France. 

Cardiomyopathy<====>46133<====>Cardiomyopathy   Cardiomyopathy is a group of diseases that affect the heart muscle.Early on there may be few or no symptoms.   Some people may have shortness of breath, feel tired, or have swelling of the legs due to heart failure.   An irregular heart beat may occur as well as fainting.Those affected are at an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.Types of cardiomyopathy include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, and takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome).   In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy the heart muscle enlarges and thickens. 

Robert Bylot<====>46134<====>Robert Bylot  Robert Bylot was a 17th-century explorer who made four voyages to the Arctic.

In the spring of 1611, Hudson wanted to continue the expedition, but the crew wanted to return home.  There was discontent between the Captain (Hudson) and members of the crew, and Bylot was stripped of his rank. 

George Lakoff<====>46135<====>George Lakoff  George P.  Lakoff ( , born May 24, 1941) is an American cognitive linguist and    philosopher, best known for his thesis that lives of individuals are significantly influenced by the central metaphors they use to explain complex phenomena. The conceptual metaphor thesis, introduced in his and Mark Johnson's 1980 book Metaphors We Live By has found applications in a number of academic disciplines and its application to politics, literature, philosophy and mathematics has led him into territory normally considered basic to political science.  In the 1996 book Moral Politics, Lakoff described conservative voters as being influenced by the "strict father model" as a central metaphor for such a complex phenomenon as the state, and liberal/progressive voters as being influenced by the "nurturant parent model" as the folk psychological metaphor for this complex phenomenon. 

The Football Association<====>46136<====>The Football Association   The Football Association, also known simply as the FA, is the governing body of association football in England, and the Crown dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man.  Formed in 1863, it is the oldest football association in the world and is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the amateur and professional game in its territory. The FA sanctions all competitive football matches within its remit at national level, and indirectly at local level through the County Football Associations.  It runs numerous competitions, the most famous of which is the FA Cup.

Planner (programming language)<====>46143<====>Planner (programming language)  Planner (often seen in publications as "PLANNER" although it is not an acronym) is a programming language designed by Carl Hewitt at MIT, and first published in 1969.   First, subsets such as Micro-Planner and Pico-Planner were implemented, and then essentially the whole language was implemented as Popler by Julian Davies at the University of Edinburgh in the POP-2 programming language.   Derivations such as QA4, Conniver, QLISP and Ether (see Scientific Community Metaphor) were important tools in Artificial Intelligence research in the 1970s, which influenced commercial developments such as KEE and ART. Procedural approach versus logical approachThe two major paradigms for constructing semantic software systems were procedural and logical. 

Solaris (operating system)<====>46145<====>Solaris (operating system)  Solaris is a Unix operating system originally developed by Sun Microsystems.  It superseded their earlier SunOS in 1993.  In 2010, after the Sun acquisition by Oracle, it was renamed Oracle Solaris.    Solaris is known for its scalability, especially on SPARC systems, and for originating many innovative features such as DTrace, ZFS and Time Slider.    Solaris supports SPARC and x86-64 workstations and servers from Oracle and other vendors.  Solaris is registered as compliant with the Single UNIX Specification.  Historically, Solaris was developed as proprietary software.  In June 2005, Sun Microsystems released most of the codebase under the CDDL license, and founded the OpenSolaris open-source project. 

GLONASS<====>46149<====>GLONASS GLONASS ( ,  ;  ; transliteration  ), or "Global Navigation Satellite System", is a space-based satellite navigation system operating in the radionavigation-satellite service.  It provides an alternative to GPS and is the second navigational system in operation with global coverage and of comparable precision. Manufacturers of GPS navigation devices say that adding GLONASS made more satellites available to them, meaning positions can be fixed more quickly and accurately, especially in built-up areas where the view to some GPS satellites is obscured by buildings.    Development of GLONASS began in the Soviet Union in 1976. 

Lua (programming language)<====>46150<====>Lua (programming language)   Lua (   , frommeaning moon) is a lightweight, multi-paradigm programming language designed primarily for embedded systems and clients.Lua is cross-platform, since the interpreter is written in ANSI C,    and has a relatively simple C API.  Lua was originally designed in 1993 as a language for extending software applications to meet the increasing demand for customization at the time.  It provided the basic facilities of most procedural programming languages, but more complicated or domain-specific features were not included; rather, it included mechanisms for extending the language, allowing programmers to implement such features.

It is famous for its intact Renaissance-era city walls.  History Ancient and medieval cityLucca was founded by the Etruscans (there are traces of an earlier Ligurian settlement in the 3rd century BC called Luk meaning marsh in which the name Lucca originated) and became a Roman colony in 180 BC.The rectangular grid of its historical centre preserves the Roman street plan, and the Piazza San Michele occupies the site of the ancient forum. 

Siderno<====>46172<====>Siderno Siderno ( ) is a town and comune located in Calabria, Italy about 3 kilometres from Locri. Siderno Marina is the newer town located on the Ionian coast.  It is popular with both Italian and foreign tourists and has a bathing beach. Siderno Superiore is the old town, higher up on the flank of the coastal mountain range.  It has historic palaces, old buildings and very narrow streets.  It has now become a ghost town because most of the old population has moved to the more modern Siderno which is the new city and offers more job opportunities and services. 

Fish and chips<====>46173<====>Fish and chips   Fish and chips is a hot dish of English origin consisting of fried battered fish and hot potato chips.  It is a common take-away food and an early example of culinary fusion. Fish and chips first appeared in the 1860s; by 1910 there were more than 25,000 fish and chip shops across the UK, and by the 1930s there were over 35,000.  History Fried fish first brought to England in large quantities by Western Sephardic Jews  is considered to be the model for the fish element of the dish. 

National Institutes of Health<====>46174<====>National Institutes of Health   The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the primary agency of the United States government responsible for biomedical and public health research, founded in the late 1870s.  It is part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services with facilities mainly located in Bethesda, Maryland.  It conducts its own scientific research through its Intramural Research Program (IRP) and provides major biomedical research funding to non-NIH research facilities through its Extramural Research Program.  , the IRP had 1,200 principal investigators and more than 4,000 postdoctoral fellows in basic, translational, and clinical research, being the largest biomedical research institution in the world,  while, as of 2003, the extramural arm provided 28% of biomedical research funding spent annually in the U. 

Epidemic typhus<====>46177<====>Epidemic typhus Epidemic typhus is a form of typhus so named because the disease often causes epidemics following wars and natural disasters.  The causative organism is Rickettsia prowazekii, transmitted by the human body louse (Pediculus humanus humanus).   Signs and symptomsSymptoms include severe headache, a sustained high fever, cough, rash, severe muscle pain, chills, falling blood pressure, stupor, sensitivity to light, delirium and death.  A rash begins on the chest about five days after the fever appears, and spreads to the trunk and extremities.  A symptom common to all forms of typhus is a fever which may reach 39 °C (102 °F). 

SQUID<====>46178<====>SQUID  A SQUID (for superconducting quantum interference device) is a very sensitive magnetometer used to measure extremely subtle magnetic fields, based on superconducting loops containing Josephson junctions. SQUIDs are sensitive enough to measure fields as low as 5 aT (5×10 −18  T) with a few days of averaged measurements.Their noise levels are as low as 3 fT·Hz −½ .   For comparison, a typical refrigerator magnet produces 0. 01 tesla (10 −2  T), and some processes in animals produce very small magnetic fields between 10 −9  T and 10 −6  T. 

White noise<====>46182<====>White noise   In signal processing, white noise is a random signal having equal intensity at different frequencies, giving it a constant power spectral density.The term is used, with this or similar meanings, in many scientific and technical disciplines, including physics, acoustic engineering, telecommunications, statistical forecasting, and many more.  White noise refers to a statistical model for signals and signal sources, rather than to any specific signal.   White noise draws its name from white light,  although light that appears white generally does not have a flat power spectral density over the visible band. 

Butter<====>46183<====>Butter   Butter is a dairy product containing up to 80% butterfat (in commercial products) which is solid when chilled and at room temperature in some regions and liquid when warmed.  It is made by churning fresh or fermented cream or milk to separate the butterfat from the buttermilk.  It is generally used as a spread on plain or toasted bread products and a condiment on cooked vegetables, as well as in cooking, such as baking, sauce making, and pan frying.  Butter consists of butterfat, milk proteins and water, and in some types, added salt.  Butter may also be sold with added flavourings, such as garlic butter. 

The Star Beast<====>46184<====>The Star Beast The Star Beast is a 1954 science fiction novel by Robert A.  Heinlein about a high school senior who discovers that his extraterrestrial pet is more than it appears to be.  The novel was originally serialised, somewhat abridged, in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction (May, June, July 1954) as Star Lummox and then published in hardcover as part of Scribner's series of Heinlein juveniles. Plot summaryAn ancestor of John Thomas Stuart XI brought the alien, long-lived Lummox home from an interstellar voyage.  The pet he inherited from his late father has learned how to speak, and has gradually grown from the size of a collie pup to a ridable behemoth—especially after consuming a used car. 

Lobotomy<====>46187<====>Lobotomy    Lobotomy is a neurosurgical procedure, a form of psychosurgery.  It consists of cutting or scraping away most of the connections to and from the prefrontal cortex, the anterior part of the frontal lobes of the brain. The procedure was controversial from its inception.   It was prescribed for psychiatric (and occasionally other) conditions as a mainstream procedure in some Western countries for more than two decades.   This was despite general recognition of frequent and serious side effects.   While some patients experienced symptomatic improvement with the operation, the improvements were achieved at the cost of creating other impairments. 

Tillage<====>46191<====>TillageTillage is the agricultural preparation of soil by mechanical   of various types, such as digging, stirring, and overturning.  Examples of human-powered tilling methods using hand tools include shovelling, picking, mattock work, hoeing, and raking.  Examples of draft-animal-powered or mechanized work include ploughing (overturning with moldboards or chiseling with chisel shanks), rototilling, rolling with cultipackers or other rollers, harrowing, and cultivating with cultivator shanks (teeth).  Small-scale gardening and farming, for household food production or small business production, tends to use the smaller-scale methods, whereas medium- to large-scale farming tends to use the larger-scale methods.  There is a fluid continuum, however. 

Threshing machine<====>46193<====>Threshing machineA threshing machine or thresher is a piece of farm equipment that threshes grain, that is it removes the seeds from the stalks and husks.  It does so by beating the plant to make the seeds fall out.  Before such machines were developed, threshing was done by hand with flails: such hand threshing was very laborious and time-consuming, taking about one-quarter of agricultural labor by the 18th century. Mechanization of this process removed a substantial amount of drudgery from farm labor.  The first threshing machine was invented circa 1786 by the Scottish engineer Andrew Meikle, and the subsequent adoption of such machines was one of the earlier examples of the mechanization of agriculture. 

Moss, Norway<====>46195<====>Moss, Norway   is a coastal town and a municipality in Østfold county, Norway.  The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Moss.  The city of Moss was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).  The rural municipality of Jeløy was merged with the city on 1 July 1943. Its administrative district covers areas east of the town, such as the island of Dillingøy in the lake Vansjø.  Parts of the town are located on the peninsula of Jeløy.  Moss city has 30,723 inhabitants (2012). NameThe Old Norse form of the name was Mors. 

Marl<====>46196<====>Marl  Marl or marlstone is  a calcium carbonate or lime-rich mud or mudstone which contains variable amounts of clays and silt.  The dominant carbonate mineral in most marls is calcite, but other carbonate minerals such as aragonite, dolomite, and siderite may be present.  Marl was originally an old term loosely applied to a variety of materials, most of which occur as loose, earthy deposits consisting chiefly of an intimate mixture of clay and calcium carbonate, formed under freshwater conditions; specifically an earthy substance containing 35–65% clay and 65–35% carbonate.   It also describes a habit of coralline red alga. 

Pink noise<====>46202<====>Pink noise  Pink noise or   noise is a signal or process with a frequency spectrum such that the power spectral density (energy or power per frequency interval) is inversely proportional to the frequency of the signal.   In pink noise, each octave (halving/doubling in frequency) carries an equal amount of noise energy.  The name arises from the pink appearance of visible light with this power spectrum.This is in contrast with white noise which has equal intensity per frequency interval. Within the scientific literature the term pink noise is sometimes used a little more loosely to refer to any noise with a power spectral density of the form S(f) \propto \frac{1}{f^\alpha}, where f is frequency, and 0 The latter (broader sense) generally correspond to a wide range of non-equilibrium driven dynamical systems. 

35 mm film<====>46203<====>35 mm film  35 mm film (millimeter) is the film gauge most commonly used for motion pictures and chemical still photography (see 135 film).  The name of the gauge refers to the width of the photographic film, which consists of strips 34. 98 ±0. 03 mm (1. 377 ±0. 001 inches) wide.    ANSI/SMPTE 139–1996.  SMPTE STANDARD for Motion-Picture Film (35 mm) - Perforated KS.  Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers.  White Plains, NY.    The standard negative pulldown for movies ("single-frame" format) is four perforations per frame along both edges, which results in 16 frames per foot of film. 

Prince of Wales<====>46204<====>Prince of Wales   Prince of Wales ( ) was a title granted to princes born in Wales from the 12th century onwards; the term replaced the use of the word king.  One of the last Welsh princes, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, was killed in battle in 1282 by Edward I, King of England, whose son Edward (born in Caernarfon Castle in Wales) was invested as the first English Prince of Wales in 1301.  Since the 14th century, the title has been a dynastic title granted to the heir apparent to the English or British monarch, but the failure to be granted the title does not affect the rights to royal succession. 

Whitefish (fisheries term)<====>46205<====>Whitefish (fisheries term) Whitefish or white fish is a fisheries term for several species of demersal fish with fins, particularly Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), Caspian kutum (Rutilus kutum),  whiting (Merluccius bilinearis), and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), but also hake (Urophycis), pollock (Pollachius), or others.  Whitefish (Coregonidae) is also the name of several species of Atlantic freshwater fish, so the use of the two-word term 'white fish' is less misleading. White fish live on or near the seafloor, and can be contrasted with the oily or pelagic fish which live in the water column away from the seafloor.  Unlike oily fish, white fish contain oils only in their liver, rather than in their gut, and can therefore be gutted as soon as they are caught, on board the ship . 

Clairvaux Abbey<====>46206<====>Clairvaux Abbey  Clairvaux Abbey (Latin: Clara Vallis) is a Cistercian monastery in Ville-sous-la-Ferté, 15 km from Bar-sur-Aube, in the Aube department in northeastern France.  The original building, founded in 1115 by St.  Bernard, is now in ruins; the present structure dates from 1708.  Jean-François Leroux-Dhuys, "Clairvaux : de l'abbaye à la prison", émission La Marche de l'Histoire sur France Inter, 12 juin 2012  Clairvaux Abbey was a good example of the general layout of a Cistercian monastery.  The Abbey has been listed since 1926 as a historical monument by the French Ministry of Culture. The grounds are now occupied and used by Clairvaux Prison, a high-security prison. 

Dudley Moore<====>46208<====>Dudley Moore Dudley Stuart John Moore, CBE ( ; 19 April 1935 27 March 2002) was an English actor, comedian, musician and composer. Moore first came to prominence in the UK as one of the four writer-performers in the comedy revue Beyond the Fringe from 1960, and with one member of that team, Peter Cook, collaborated on the television series Not Only. . .  But Also.  The double act worked on other projects until the mid-1970s, by which time Moore had settled in Los Angeles to concentrate on his film acting. His solo career as a comedy film actor was heightened by the success of hit Hollywood films, particularly Foul Play (1978), 10 (1979) and Arthur (1981).

He was killed during the Battle of Mohács fighting the Ottomans, whose victory led to the Ottoman annexation of Hungary.  "Louis II".  (2009).  Encyclopædia Britannica.  Retrieved April 24, 2009.   He had no legitimate issue. Early lifeBorn prematurely in Buda on 1 July 1506, the court doctors kept him alive by slaying animals and wrapping him in their warm carcasses as a primitive incubator. 

VistaVision<====>46210<====>VistaVision VistaVision is a higher resolution, widescreen variant of the 35 mm motion picture film format which was created by engineers at Paramount Pictures in 1954. Paramount did not use anamorphic processes such as CinemaScope but refined the quality of their flat widescreen system by orienting the 35 mm negative horizontally in the camera gate and shooting onto a larger area, which yielded a finer-grained projection print. As finer-grained film stocks appeared on the market, VistaVision became obsolete.  Paramount dropped the format after only seven years, although for another forty years the format was used by some European and Japanese producers for feature films, and by American film studios for high resolution special effects sequences. 

Tuna<====>46211<====>Tuna    A tuna is a saltwater fish that belongs to the tribe Thunnini, a sub-grouping of the mackerel family (Scombridae).   Thunnini comprises fifteen species across five genera,  the sizes of which vary greatly, ranging from the bullet tuna (max.  length:  , weight:  ) up to the Atlantic bluefin tuna (max.  length:  , weight:  ).  The bluefin averages  , and is believed to live for up to 50 years. Tuna and mackerel sharks are the only species of fish that can maintain a body temperature higher than that of the surrounding water.

70 mm film<====>46215<====>70 mm film 70 mm film (or 65 mm film) is a wide high-resolution film gauge for still and motion picture photography, with higher resolution than the standard 35 mm motion picture film format.  As used in cameras, the film is   wide.  For projection, the original 65 mm film is printed on   film.  The additional 5 mm are for four magnetic strips holding six tracks of stereophonic sound.  Although later 70 mm prints use digital sound encoding, the vast majority of existing and surviving 70 mm prints predate this technology.  Each frame is five perforations tall, with an aspect ratio of 2. 

Israeli–Palestinian conflict<====>46216<====>Israeli–Palestinian conflict    The Israeli–Palestinian conflict ( ;  ) is the ongoing struggle between Israelis and Palestinians that began in the mid-20th century.The origins to the conflict can be traced back to Jewish immigration, and sectarian conflict in Mandatory Palestine between Jews and Arabs.   It has been referred to as the world's "most intractable conflict", with the ongoing Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip reaching 51 years.    Despite a long-term peace process and the general reconciliation of Israel with Egypt and Jordan, Israelis and Palestinians have failed to reach a final peace agreement. 

Sowing<====>46223<====>Sowing  Sowing is the process of planting seeds.  An area or object that has had seeds planted in it will be described as being sowed. Plants which are usually sownAmong the major field crops, oats, wheat, and rye are sown, grasses and legumes are seeded and maize and soybeans are planted.   In planting, wider rows (generally 75  cm (30  in) or more) are used, and the intent is to have precise; even spacing between individual seeds in the row, various mechanisms have been devised to count out individual seeds at exact intervals.

16 mm film<====>46224<====>16 mm film 16 mm film is a historically popular and economical gauge of film.  16 mm refers to the width of the film; other common film gauges include 8 and 35 mm.  It is generally used for non-theatrical (e. g. , industrial, educational) film-making, or for low-budget motion pictures.  It also existed as a popular amateur or home movie-making format for several decades, alongside 8 mm film and later Super 8 film.  Eastman Kodak released the first 16 mm "outfit" in 1923, consisting of a camera, projector, tripod, screen and splicer, for $335.   RCA-Victor introduced a 16 mm sound movie projector in 1932,and developed an optical sound-on-film 16 mm camera, released in 1935. 

8 mm film<====>46225<====>8 mm film8 mm film is a motion picture film format in which the film strip is eight millimeters wide.  It exists in two main versions — the original standard 8 mm film, also known as regular 8 mm, and Super 8.  Although both standard 8 mm and Super 8 are 8 mm wide, Super 8 has a larger image area because of its smaller and more widely spaced perforations. There are also two other varieties of Super 8—Single 8 mm and Straight-8 that require different cameras, but produce a final film with the same dimensions. Standard 8 The standard 8 mm (also known as regular 8) film format was developed by the Eastman Kodak company during the Great Depression and released to the market in 1932 to create a home movie format that was less expensive than 16 mm.

Super 8 film<====>46231<====>Super 8 film Super 8mm film is a motion picture film format released in 1965    by Eastman Kodak as an improvement over the older "Double" or "Regular" 8 mm home movie format. The film is nominally 8mm wide, the same as older formatted 8mm film, but the dimensions of the rectangular perforations along one edge are smaller, which allows for a greater exposed area.  The Super 8 standard also allocates the border opposite the perforations for an oxide stripe upon which sound can be magnetically recorded. Unlike Super 35, the film stock used for Super 8 is not compatible with standard 8 mm film cameras. 

Siegfried Sassoon<====>46233<====>Siegfried Sassoon  Siegfried Loraine Sassoon,   (8 September 1886 – 1 September 1967) was an English poet, writer, and soldier.  Decorated for bravery on the Western Front,  he became one of the leading poets of the First World War.  His poetry both described the horrors of the trenches, and satirised the patriotic pretensions of those who, in Sassoon's view, were responsible for a jingoism-fuelled war.   Sassoon became a focal point for dissent within the armed forces when he made a lone protest against the continuation of the war in his "Soldier's Declaration" of 1917, culminating in his admission to a military psychiatric hospital; this resulted in his forming a friendship with Wilfred Owen, who was greatly influenced by him. 

Refrigeration<====>46238<====>RefrigerationRefrigeration is a process of removing heat from a low-temperature reservoir and transferring it to a high-temperature reservoir.  The work of heat transfer is traditionally driven by mechanical means, but can also be driven by heat, magnetism, electricity, laser, or other means.  Refrigeration has many applications, including, but not limited to: household refrigerators, industrial freezers, cryogenics, and air conditioning.  Heat pumps may use the heat output of the refrigeration process, and also may be designed to be reversible, but are otherwise similar to air conditioning units.    Refrigeration has had a large impact on industry, lifestyle, agriculture, and settlement patterns.

Fever<====>46253<====>Fever   Fever, also known as pyrexia and febrile response,  is defined as having a temperature above the normal range due to an increase in the body's temperature set-point.   There is not a single agreed-upon upper limit for normal temperature with sources using values between  . The increase in set-point triggers increased muscle contractions and causes a feeling of cold.   This results in greater heat production and efforts to conserve heat.   When the set-point temperature returns to normal, a person feels hot, becomes flushed, and may begin to sweat. 

Telemetry<====>46256<====>Telemetry Telemetry is an automated communications process by which measurements and other data are collected at remote or inaccessible points and transmitted to receiving equipment for monitoring.The word is derived from Greek roots: tele = remote, and metron = measure.  Systems that need external instructions and data to operate require the counterpart of telemetry, telecommand.  Although the term commonly refers to wireless data transfer mechanisms (e. g. , using radio, ultrasonic, or infrared systems), it also encompasses data transferred over other media such as a telephone or computer network, optical link or other wired communications like power line carriers. 

Corinthian order<====>46259<====>Corinthian orderThe Corinthian order is the last developed of the three principal classical orders of ancient Greek and Roman architecture.  The other two are the Doric order which was the earliest, followed by the Ionic order.  When classical architecture was revived during the Renaissance, two more orders were added to the  , the Tuscan order and the Composite order.  The Corinthian, with its offshoot the Composite, is the most ornate of the orders, characterized by slender fluted columns and elaborate capitals decorated with acanthus leaves and scrolls.  There are many variations. The name "Corinthian" is derived from the ancient Greek city of Corinth, although the style had its own model in Roman practice, following precedents set by the Temple of Mars Ultor in the Forum of Augustus (c.

The dream may contain situations of discomfort, psychological or physical terror or panic.  Sufferers often awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to sleep for a short period of time.  Nightmares can have physical causes such as sleeping in an uncomfortable or awkward position, having a fever, or psychological causes such as stress, anxiety, and as a side effect of various drugs, such as Psilocybin mushrooms. 

Nadsat<====>46264<====>Nadsat Nadsat is a fictional register or argot used by the teenagers in Anthony Burgess's novel A Clockwork Orange.  In addition to being a novelist, Burgess was a linguist  and he used this background to depict his characters as speaking a form of Russian-influenced English.  The name itself comes from the Russian suffix equivalent of "-teen" as in "thirteen" (-надцать, -nad·tsat&apos;).  Nadsat was also used in Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of the book.  Description Nadsat is a mode of speech used by the nadsat, members of the teen subculture in the novel A Clockwork Orange. 

Atbash<====>46265<====>Atbash Atbash ( ; also transliterated Atbaš) is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher originally used to encode the Hebrew alphabet.  It can be modified for use with any known writing system with a standard collating order. The CipherThe Atbash cipher is a particular type of monoalphabetic cipher formed by taking the alphabet (or abjad, syllabary, etc. ) and mapping it to its reverse, so that the first letter becomes the last letter, the second letter becomes the second to last letter, and so on.  For example, the Latin alphabet would work like this: Due to the fact that there is only one way to perform this, the Atbash cipher provides no communications security, as it lacks any sort of key. 

Encaustic painting<====>46268<====>Encaustic painting  Encaustic painting, also known as hot wax painting, involves using heated beeswax to which colored pigments are added.  The liquid or paste is then applied to a surface—usually prepared wood, though canvas and other materials are often used.  The simplest encaustic mixture can be made from adding pigments to beeswax, but there are several other recipes that can be used—some containing other types of waxes, damar resin, linseed oil, or other ingredients.   Pure, powdered pigments can be used, though some mixtures use oil paints or other forms of pigment.  Metal tools and special brushes can be used to shape the paint before it cools, or heated metal tools can be used to manipulate the wax once it has cooled onto the surface. 

New materials in 20th-century art<====>46270<====>New materials in 20th-century artNew materials in 20th-century art were introduced to art making from the very beginning of the century.  The introduction of new materials (and techniques) and heretofore non-art materials helped drive change in art during the 20th century.  Traditional materials and techniques were not necessarily displaced in the 20th century.  Rather they functioned alongside innovations that came with the 20th century.  Such mainstays as oil-on-canvas painting, and sculpting in traditional materials continued right through the 20th century into the 21st century.  Furthermore, even "traditional" materials were greatly expanded in the course of the 20th century. 

Mother's Day<====>46276<====>Mother's Day    Mother's Day is a celebration honoring the mother of the family, as well as motherhood, maternal bonds, and the influence of mothers in society.

It complements similar celebrations honoring family members, such as Father's Day, Siblings Day, and Grandparents Day. In the United States, celebration of Mother's Day began in the early 20th century.  It is not related to the many celebrations of mothers and motherhood that have occurred throughout the world over thousands of years, such as the Greek cult to Cybele, the Roman festival of Hilaria, or the Christian Mothering Sunday celebration (originally a commemoration of Mother Church, not motherhood). 

Ukrainian language<====>46279<====>Ukrainian language  Ukrainian   (   ) is an East Slavic language.  It is the official state language of Ukraine and first of two principal languages of Ukrainians; it is one of the three official languages in the unrecognized state of Transnistria, the other two being Romanian and Russian.  Written Ukrainian uses a variant of the Cyrillic script (see Ukrainian alphabet). Historical linguists trace the origin of the Ukrainian language to the Old East Slavic of the early medieval state of Kievan Rus'.  After the fall of the Kievan Rus' as well as the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, the language developed into a form called the Ruthenian language. 

Father's Day<====>46280<====>Father's Day    Father's Day is a celebration honoring fathers and celebrating fatherhood, paternal bonds, and the influence of fathers in society.  In Catholic Europe, it has been celebrated on June 17 (St.  Joseph's Day) since the Middle Ages.

Lobster<====>46310<====>Lobster  Lobsters comprise a family (Nephropidae, sometimes also Homaridae) of large marine crustaceans. Lobsters have long bodies with muscular tails, and live in crevices or burrows on the sea floor.  Three of their five pairs of legs have claws, including the first pair, which are usually much larger than the others.  Highly prized as seafood, lobsters are economically important, and are often one of the most profitable commodities in coastal areas they populate.   Commercially important species include two species of Homarus (which looks more like the stereotypical lobster) from the northern Atlantic Ocean, and scampi (which looks more like a shrimp, or a "mini lobster") – the Northern Hemisphere genus Nephrops and the Southern Hemisphere genus Metanephrops.

Chowder<====>46316<====>Chowder    Chowder is a type of soup or stew often prepared with milk or cream and thickened with broken crackers, crushed ship biscuit, or a roux.  Variations of chowder can be seafood or vegetable.  Crackers such as oyster crackers or saltines may accompany chowders as a side item, and cracker pieces may be dropped atop the dish.  New England clam chowder is typically made with chopped clams and diced potatoes, in a mixed cream and milk base, often with a small amount of butter.  Other common chowders include seafood chowder, which includes fish, clams, and many other types of shellfish; corn chowder, which uses corn instead of clams; a wide variety of fish chowders;  and potato chowder, which is often made with cheese. 

Portable soup<====>46318<====>Portable soup Portable soup was a kind of dehydrated food used in the 18th and 19th centuries.  It was a precursor of the later meat extract and bouillon cubes, and of industrially dehydrated food.  It is also known as pocket soup or veal glew.  It is a cousin of the glace de viande of French cooking.  It was long a staple of seamen and explorers, for it would keep for many months or even years.  In this context, it was a filling and nutritious dish.   Portable soup of less extended vintage was, according to the 1881 Household Cyclopedia,"exceedingly convenient for private families, for by putting one of the cakes in a saucepan with about a quart of water, and a little salt, a basin of good broth may be made in a few minutes. 

Asparagus<====>46319<====>Asparagus   Asparagus, or garden asparagus, folk name sparrow grass,  scientific name Asparagus officinalis, is a spring vegetable, a flowering perennial plant species in the genus Asparagus. It was once classified in the lily family, like the related Allium species, onions and garlic, but the Liliaceae have been split and the onion-like plants are now in the family Amaryllidaceae and asparagus in the Asparagaceae.  Asparagus officinalis is native to most of Europe, northern Africa and western Asia,    and is widely cultivated as a vegetable crop. BiologyAsparagus is a herbaceous, perennial plant    growing to   tall, with stout stems with much-branched, feathery foliage.

Some species face their left sides upward, some face their right sides upward, and others face either side upward. Many important food fish are in this order, including the flounders, soles, turbot, plaice, and halibut.  Some flatfish can camouflage themselves on the ocean floor. TaxonomyOver 700 species are in the 11 families. 

Flat tax<====>46334<====>Flat tax   A flat tax (short for flat tax rate) is a tax system with a constant marginal rate, usually applied to individual or corporate income.

True flat rate income taxA true flat rate tax is a system of taxation where one tax rate is applied to all personal income with no deductions. 

Stone Soup<====>46335<====>Stone Soup  Stone Soup is an old folk story in which hungry strangers convince the people of a town to each share a small amount of their food in order to make a meal that everyone enjoys.  In varying traditions, the stone has been replaced with other common inedible objects, and therefore the fable is also known as axe soup, button soup, nail soup, and wood soup. StorySome travelers come to a village, carrying nothing more than an empty cooking pot.  Upon their arrival, the villagers are unwilling to share any of their food stores with the hungry travelers. 

Passerine<====>46336<====>Passerine A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species.

Jack McDevitt<====>46356<====>Jack McDevitt Jack McDevitt (born April 14, 1935)  is an American science fiction author whose novels frequently deal with attempts to make contact with alien races, and with archaeology or xenoarchaeology.  His two main series are the Alex Benedict series and the Priscilla Hutchins series. McDevitt's first published story was "The Emerson Effect" in The Twilight Zone Magazine in 1981.  Five years later, he published his first novel, The Hercules Text, about the discovery of an intelligently conceived signal whose repercussions threaten human civilization.  This novel set the tone for many of McDevitt's following novels, which focused on making first contact. 

Sashimi<====>46360<====>Sashimi Sashimi ( ;  ,  ) is a Japanese delicacy consisting of very fresh raw meat or fish sliced into thin pieces. OriginThe word sashimi means "pierced body", i. e.  " " = sashimi, where    = sashi (pierced, stuck) and   = mi (body, meat).  This word dates from the Muromachi period, and was possibly coined when the word " " = kiru (cut), the culinary step, was considered too inauspicious to be used by anyone other than samurai.   This word may derive from the culinary practice of sticking the fish's tail and fin to the slices for the purpose of identifying the fish being eaten. 

Phalangeriformes<====>46371<====>Phalangeriformes   Phalangeriformes is a suborder of any of about 70 small- to medium-sized arboreal marsupial species native to Australia, New Guinea, and Sulawesi (and introduced to New Zealand and China).  The suborder includes animals commonly known as possums, gliders, and cuscus.  The common name "possum" for various Phalangeriformes species derives from the creatures' resemblance to the opossums of the Americas (the term comes from Powhatan language aposoum "white animal", from Proto-Algonquian *wa·p-aʔɬemwa "white dog").  However, although opossums are also marsupials, Australasian possums are more closely related to other Australasian marsupials such as kangaroos. Phalangeriformes are quadrupedal diprotodont marsupials with long tails. 

Edward I of England<====>46373<====>Edward I of EnglandEdward I (17/18 June 1239 – 7 July 1307), also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots ( ), was King of England from 1272 to 1307.  Before his accession to the throne, he was commonly referred to as The Lord Edward.   He spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law.  Through an extensive legal inquiry, Edward investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law.  Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs. 

Diatom<====>46374<====>Diatom  Diatoms  are a major group of microalgae, and are among the most common types of phytoplankton.  Diatoms are unicellular, although they can form colonies in the shape of filaments or ribbons (e. g.  Fragilaria), fans (e. g.  Meridion), zigzags (e. g.  Tabellaria), or stars (e. g.  Asterionella).  The first diatom formally described in scientific literature, the colonial Bacillaria paradoxa, was found in 1783 by Danish naturalist Otto Friedrich Müller.  Diatoms are producers within the food chain.   A unique feature of diatom cells is that they are enclosed within a cell wall made of silica (hydrated silicon dioxide) called a frustule. 

Perkin Warbeck<====>46375<====>Perkin Warbeck Perkin Warbeck (c.  1474 – 23 November 1499) was a pretender to the English throne.  Warbeck claimed to be Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York, who was the second son of Edward IV and one of the so-called "princes in the tower".  Richard, if he was alive, would have been the rightful heir to the throne.  Due to uncertainty as to whether Richard had died (either of some natural cause or from having been murdered in the Tower of London) or whether he had somehow survived, Warbeck's claim gathered some followers.  Followers may have truly believed Warbeck was Richard, or may have supported him simply because of their desire to overthrow Henry and reclaim the throne. 

Monmouth<====>46376<====>Monmouth   Monmouth (    or    ;   meaning "town on the Monnow") is the historic county town of Monmouthshire, Wales.  It is situated where the River Monnow meets the River Wye, within   of the border with England.    The town is   northeast of Cardiff, and   west of London.  It is within the Monmouthshire local authority, and the parliamentary constituency of Monmouth.  Monmouth's population in the 2011 census was 10,508, rising from 8,877 in 2001. The town was the site of a small Roman fort, Blestium, and became established after the Normans built a castle here after 1067. 

Edward III of England<====>46377<====>Edward III of England    Edward III (13 November 1312 – 21 June 1377) was King of England from 25 January 1327 until his death; he is noted for his military success and for restoring royal authority after the disastrous and unorthodox reign of his father, Edward II.  Edward III transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe.  His long reign of 50 years was the second longest in medieval England and saw vital developments in legislation and government—in particular the evolution of the English parliament—as well as the ravages of the Black Death. 

Aquitaine<====>46378<====>Aquitaine    Aquitaine ( ;  ;  ;  ; Poitevin-Saintongeais: Aguiéne), archaic Guyenne/Guienne (Occitan: Guiana) was a traditional region of France, and was an administrative region of France until 1 January 2016.  It is now part of the new region Nouvelle-Aquitaine.It is situated in the south-western part of Metropolitan France, along the Atlantic Ocean and the Pyrenees mountain range on the border with Spain.  It is composed of the five departments of Dordogne, Lot-et-Garonne, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, Landes and Gironde.  In the Middle Ages, Aquitaine was a kingdom and a duchy, whose boundaries fluctuated considerably. 

East Anglia<====>46379<====>East Anglia   East Anglia is a geographical area in the East of England.  The area included has varied  but the legally defined NUTS 2 statistical unit, comprises the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, including the City of Peterborough unitary authority.The name derives from the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of the East Angles, a tribe that originated in Angeln, northern Germany. AreaDefinitions of what constitutes East Anglia vary.  The Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of East Anglia, established in the 6th century, originally consisted of the modern counties of Norfolk and Suffolk and expanded west into at least part of Cambridgeshire. 

Coaxial cable<====>46380<====>Coaxial cable  Coaxial cable, or coax (pronounced  ), is a type of electrical cable that has an inner conductor surrounded by a tubular insulating layer, surrounded by a tubular conducting shield.  Many coaxial cables also have an insulating outer sheath or jacket.   The term coaxial comes from the inner conductor and the outer shield sharing a geometric axis.  Coaxial cable was invented by English engineer and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, who patented the design in 1880.  Coaxial cable differs from other shielded cables because the dimensions of the cable are controlled to give a precise, constant conductor spacing, which is needed for it to function efficiently as a transmission line. 

Jan van Eyck<====>46381<====>Jan van EyckJan van Eyck ( ) (before c.  1390 – 9 July 1441) was an Early Netherlandish painter active in Bruges.  He is often considered one of the founders of Early Netherlandish painting and one of the most significant representatives of Northern Renaissance art.  The few surviving records of his early life indicate that he was born c.  1380–1390, most likely in Maaseik.  He took employment in the Hague as painter and Valet de chambre with John III the Pitiless, ruler of Holland and Hainaut in the Hague around 1422, when he was already a master painter with workshop assistants. 

Jane Seymour<====>46383<====>Jane Seymour   Jane Seymour (c.  1508 24 October 1537) was Queen of England from 1536 to 1537 as the third wife of King Henry VIII.

She died of postnatal complications less than two weeks after the birth of her only child, a son who became King Edward VI.  She was the only one of Henry's wives to receive a queen's funeral, and his only consort to be buried beside him in St George's Chapel at Buckingham palace. ChildhoodJane was probably born at Wulfhall, Wiltshire,  although West Bower Manor has also been suggested,  the daughter of Sir John Seymour and Margery Wentworth. 

Richard Cromwell<====>46386<====>Richard Cromwell Richard Cromwell (4 October 1626 12 July 1712) became the second Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland, and was one of only two commoners to become the English head of state, the other being his father, Oliver Cromwell, from whom he inherited the post. On his father's death Richard became Lord Protector,  but lacked authority.  He attempted to mediate between the army and civil society, and allowed a Parliament which contained a large number of disaffected Presbyterians and  Royalists.   Suspicions that civilian councillors were intent on supplanting the army were brought to a head by an attempt to prosecute a major-general for actions against a Royalist. 

Incubus (1966 film)<====>46387<====>Incubus (1966 film) Incubus ( ) is a 1966 black-and-white American horror film filmed entirely in the constructed language Esperanto.  It was directed by Leslie Stevens, creator of The Outer Limits, and stars William Shatner, shortly before he would begin his work on Star Trek.  The film's cinematography was by Conrad Hall, who went on to win three Academy Awards for his work on the films Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, American Beauty and Road to Perdition. The use of Esperanto was intended to create an eerie, other-worldly feeling, Esperanto and cinema  and Stevens prohibited dubbing the film into other languages; however, on the Special Features section of the DVD the makers claim that Esperanto was used because of perceived greater international sales.

S. ) until his death. George was the last British monarch born outside Great Britain: he was born and brought up in northern Germany.   His grandmother, Sophia of Hanover, became second in line to the British throne after about fifty Catholics higher in line were excluded by the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Acts of Union 1707, which restricted the succession to Protestants. 

Edward IV of England<====>46390<====>Edward IV of EnglandEdward IV (28 April 1442 – 9 April 1483) was the King of England from 4 March 1461 to 3 October 1470,   and again from 11 April 1471 until his death in 1483.  He was the first Yorkist King of England.   The first half of his rule was marred by the violence associated with the Wars of the Roses, but he overcame the Lancastrian challenge to the throne at Tewkesbury in 1471 to reign in peace until his sudden death.  Before becoming king, he was 4th Duke of York,  7th Earl of March, 5th Earl of Cambridge and 9th Earl of Ulster. 

Ramsay MacDonald<====>46391<====>Ramsay MacDonaldJames Ramsay MacDonald, (né James McDonald Ramsay; 12 October 1866 9 November 1937) was a British statesman who was the first Labour Party politician to become Prime Minister, leading minority Labour governments in 1924 and in 1929–31.  He headed a National Government from 1931 to 1935, dominated by Conservative Party and supported by only a few Labour members.  MacDonald was vehemently denounced by and expelled from the party he had helped to found. MacDonald, along with Keir Hardie and Arthur Henderson, was one of the three principal founders of the Labour Party. 

John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute<====>46393<====>John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute   John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute,   ( ; 25 May 1713 – 10 March 1792) was a Scottish nobleman who served as Prime Minister of Great Britain (1762–1763) under George III.  He was arguably the last important favourite in British politics.  He was the first Prime Minister from Scotland following the Acts of Union in 1707 and the first Tory to have held the office. BiographyEarly life and rise to prominenceA close relative of the Clan Campbell (his mother was a daughter of the 1st Duke of Argyll), Bute succeeded to the Earldom of Bute (named after the Isle of Bute) upon the death of his father, James Stuart, 2nd Earl of Bute, in 1723.

When referring to the beads, it is normally written with a lower-case initial ("a rosary"). 

Ionia<====>46401<====>Ionia  Ionia (Ancient Greek: Ἰωνία or Ἰωνίη) is an ancient region of central coastal Anatolia in present-day Turkey, the region nearest İzmir, which was historically Smyrna.  It consisted of the northernmost territories of the Ionian League of Greek  settlements.  Never a unified state, it was named after the Ionian tribe who, in the Archaic Period (600–480 BC), settled mainly the shores and islands of the Aegean Sea.  Ionian states were identified by tradition and by their use of Eastern Greek. Ionia proper comprised a narrow coastal strip from Phocaea in the north near the mouth of the river Hermus (now the Gediz), to Miletus in the south near the mouth of the river Maeander, and included the islands of Chios and Samos.

Passover Seder<====>46403<====>Passover Seder The Passover Seder   (    'order, arrangement';   seyder) is a Jewish ritual feast that marks the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Passover.  It is conducted throughout the world on the evening of the 15th day of Nisan in the Hebrew calendar (which falls in late March or in April of the Gregorian calendar).   Passover lasts for 7 days in Israel and 8 days outside Israel (other than for adherents of Reform Judaism for whom Passover is 7 days regardless of location), with Jews outside Israel other than Reform Jews holding two Seders (on the evening of the 15th and 16th of Nisan) and Jews in Israel and Reform Jews worldwide holding one Seder (on the 15th of Nisan). 

Nisan<====>46404<====>Nisan    Nisan (or Nissan;  ,  Standard  Nisan  Tiberian  Nîsān) on the Assyrian calendar is the first month, and on the Hebrew calendar is the first month of the ecclesiastical year and the seventh month (eighth, in leap year) of the civil year.  The name of the month is of Assyrian-Babylonian origin; in the Torah it is called the month of the Aviv.  (e. g.  Exodus 13:4 בְּחֹ֖דֶשׁ הָאָבִֽיב ḥōḏeš hā-’āḇîḇ) Assyrians today refer to the month as the "month of happiness. " It is a spring month of 30 days. 

Hubert van Eyck<====>46406<====>Hubert van EyckHubert van Eyck (also Huybrecht van Eyck) (c.  1385–90 – 18 September 1426) was an Early Netherlandish painter and older brother of Jan van Eyck, as well as Lambert and Margareta, also painters.  The absence of any single work that he can clearly be said to have completed continues to make assessment of his achievement highly uncertain, although for centuries he had the reputation of being an outstanding founding artist of Early Netherlandish painting.  Life and careerHe was probably born in Maaseik, in what is now the  Belgian province of Limburg, into a family in the gentry. 

Shemini Atzeret<====>46407<====>Shemini Atzeret  Shemini Atzeret (    – "Eighth [day of] Assembly"; Sefardic/Israeli pron.  shemini atzèret; Ashkenazic pron.  shmini-atsères) is a Jewish holiday.  It is celebrated on the 22nd day of the Hebrew month of Tishrei in the Land of Israel,  and on the 22nd and 23rd outside the Land, usually coinciding with late September or early October.  It directly follows the Jewish festival of Sukkot which is celebrated for seven days, and thus Shemini Atzeret is literally the eighth day.  It is a separate—yet connected—holy day devoted to the spiritual aspects of the festival of Sukkot. 

Magenta<====>46408<====>Magenta  Magenta ( ) is a color that is variously defined as purplish-red,  reddish-purple, purplish-pink, or mauvish-crimson.    On computer screens, it is made by mixing equal amounts of blue and red.    On color wheels of the RGB (additive) and CMY (subtractive) color models, it is located midway between red and blue.   It is the complementary color of green.  It is one of the four colors of ink used in color printing and by an inkjet printer, along with cyan, yellow, and black, to make all the other colors.   The tone of magenta used in printing is called "printer's magenta".

Substantia nigra<====>46425<====>Substantia nigra The substantia nigra is a basal ganglia structure located in the midbrain that plays an important role in reward and movement.  Substantia nigra is Latin for "black substance", reflecting the fact that parts of the substantia nigra appear darker than neighboring areas due to high levels of neuromelanin in dopaminergic neurons.   It was discovered in 1784 by Félix Vicq-d'Azyr,    and   Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring alluded to this structure in 1791.   Parkinson's disease is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the  substantia nigra pars compacta.  Although the substantia nigra appears as a continuous band in brain sections, anatomical studies have found that it actually consists of two parts with very different connections and functions: the pars compacta and the pars reticulata. 

Basil II<====>46426<====>Basil II   Basil II ( , Basileios II; 958 – 15 December 1025) was a Byzantine Emperor from the Macedonian dynasty who reigned from 10 January 976 to 15 December 1025.  He was known in his time as Basil the Porphyrogenitus and Basil the Young to distinguish him from his supposed ancestor, Basil I the Macedonian.  He was the second longest reigning emperor after his brother Constantine VIII whom he named co-emperor in 962, but outlived him by 3 years.  The early years of his long reign were dominated by civil war against powerful generals from the Anatolian aristocracy. 

Inspector Clouseau<====>46427<====>Inspector Clouseau    Inspector Jacques Clouseau ( ) is a fictional character in Blake Edwards's farcical The Pink Panther series.  He is portrayed by Peter Sellers in the original series, and also by Alan Arkin in the 1968 film Inspector Clouseau and, in a cameo, by Roger Moore (credited as Turk Thrust II) in the 1983 film Curse of the Pink Panther.  In the 2006 remake and its 2009 sequel, he is played by Steve Martin. Clouseau's likeness also appears in the Pink Panther animated cartoon shorts and segments.   More recent animated depictions from the 1970s onward were redesigned to more closely resemble Sellers, and later Martin. 

Assassination market<====>46428<====>Assassination market An assassination market is a prediction market where any party can place a bet (using anonymous electronic money and pseudonymous remailers) on the date of death of a given individual, and collect a payoff if they "guess" the date accurately.  This would incentivise assassination of individuals because the assassin, knowing when the action would take place, could profit by making an accurate bet on the time of the subject's death.  Because the payoff is for accurately picking the date rather than performing the action of the assassin, it is substantially more difficult to assign criminal liability for the assassination. 

Fun<====>46433<====>Fun Fun is the enjoyment of pleasure, particularly in leisure activities.  Fun is an experience — often unexpected, informal, generally not cerebral and generally purposeless.  It is an enjoyable distraction, diverting the mind and body from any serious task or contributing an extra dimension to it.  Although particularly associated with recreation and play, fun may be encountered during work, social functions, and even seemingly mundane activities of daily living.  It may often have little to no logical basis, and opinions on whether an activity is fun may differ.  A distinction between enjoyment and fun is difficult but possible to articulate, fun being a more spontaneous, playful, or active event. 

Assassins<====>46435<====>Assassins    Assassins (  al-Ḥashāshīn) is the common name used to refer to an Islamic sect formally known as the Nizari Ismailis.  Often described as a secret order led by a mysterious "Old Man of the Mountain", the Nizari Ismailis formed in the late 11th century after a split within Ismailism – a branch of Shia Islam. The Nizaris posed a strategic threat to Sunni Seljuq authority by capturing and inhabiting several mountain fortresses throughout Persia  and later Syria, under the leadership of Hassan-i Sabbah.   Asymmetric warfare, psychological warfare, and surgical strikes were often an employed tactic of the assassins, drawing their opponents into submission rather than risk killing them. 

Colorless green ideas sleep furiously<====>46438<====>Colorless green ideas sleep furiouslyColorless green ideas sleep furiously is a sentence composed by Noam Chomsky in his 1957 book Syntactic Structures as an example of a sentence that is grammatically correct, but semantically nonsensical.  The sentence was originally used in his 1955 thesis "Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory" and in his 1956 paper "Three Models for the Description of Language".Although the sentence is grammatically correct, no obvious understandable meaning can be derived from it, and thus it demonstrates the distinction between syntax and semantics.  As an example of a category mistake, it was used to show the inadequacy of the then-popular probabilistic models of grammar, and the need for more structured models. 

Philosophy of mathematics<====>46439<====>Philosophy of mathematics The philosophy of mathematics is the branch of philosophy that studies the assumptions, foundations, and implications of mathematics, and purports to provide a viewpoint of the nature and methodology of mathematics, and to understand the place of mathematics in people's lives. The logical and structural nature of mathematics itself makes this study both broad and unique among its philosophical counterparts. Recurrent themes Recurrent themes include:What is the role of humankind in developing mathematics?What are the sources of mathematical subject matter?What is the ontological status of mathematical entities?What does it mean to refer to a mathematical object?What is the character of a mathematical proposition?What is the relation between logic and mathematics?What is the role of hermeneutics in mathematics?What kinds of inquiry play a role in mathematics?What are the objectives of mathematical inquiry?What gives mathematics its hold on experience?What are the human traits behind mathematics?What is mathematical beauty?What is the source and nature of mathematical truth?What is the relationship between the abstract world of mathematics and the material universe?HistoryThe origin of mathematics is subject to argument. Whether the birth of mathematics was a random happening or induced by necessity duly contingent upon other subjects, say for example physics, is still a matter of prolific debates. Many thinkers have contributed their ideas concerning the nature of mathematics. Today, some  philosophers of mathematics aim to give accounts of this form of inquiry and its products as they stand, while others emphasize a role for themselves that goes beyond simple interpretation to critical analysis. There are traditions of mathematical philosophy in both Western philosophy and Eastern philosophy. Western philosophies of mathematics go as far back as Pythagoras, who described the theory "everything is mathematics" (mathematicism), Plato, who paraphrased Pythagoras, and studied the ontological status of mathematical objects, and Aristotle, who studied logic and issues related to infinity (actual versus potential).Greek philosophy on mathematics was strongly influenced by their study of geometry. For example, at one time, the Greeks held the opinion that 1 (one) was not a number, but rather a unit of arbitrary length. A number was defined as a multitude. Therefore, 3, for example, represented a certain multitude of units, and was thus not "truly" a number. At another point, a similar argument was made that 2 was not a number but a fundamental notion of a pair. These views come from the heavily geometric straight-edge-and-compass viewpoint of the Greeks: just as lines drawn in a geometric problem are measured in proportion to the first arbitrarily drawn line, so too are the numbers on a number line measured in proportion to the arbitrary first "number" or "one". These earlier Greek ideas of numbers were later upended by the discovery of the irrationality of the square root of two. Hippasus, a disciple of Pythagoras, showed that the diagonal of a unit square was incommensurable with its (unit-length) edge: in other words he proved there was no existing (rational) number that accurately depicts the proportion of the diagonal of the unit square to its edge. This caused a significant re-evaluation of Greek philosophy of mathematics. According to legend, fellow Pythagoreans were so traumatized by this discovery that they murdered Hippasus to stop him from spreading his heretical idea. Simon Stevin was one of the first in Europe to challenge Greek ideas in the 16th century. Beginning with Leibniz, the focus shifted strongly to the relationship between mathematics and logic. This perspective dominated the philosophy of mathematics through the time of Frege and of Russell, but was brought into question by developments in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.20th centuryA perennial issue in the philosophy of mathematics concerns the relationship between logic and mathematics at their joint foundations. While 20th-century philosophers continued to ask the questions mentioned at  the outset of this article, the philosophy of mathematics in the 20th century was characterized by a predominant interest in formal logic, set theory, and foundational issues.It is a profound puzzle that on the one hand mathematical truths seem to have a compelling inevitability, but on the other hand the source of their "truthfulness" remains elusive. Investigations into this issue are known as the foundations of mathematics program.At the start of the 20th century, philosophers of mathematics were already beginning to divide into various schools of thought about all these questions, broadly distinguished by their pictures of mathematical epistemology and ontology. Three schools, formalism, intuitionism, and logicism, emerged at this time, partly in response to the increasingly widespread worry that mathematics as it stood, and analysis in particular, did not live up to the standards of certainty and rigor that had been taken for granted. Each school addressed the issues that came to the fore at that time, either attempting to resolve them or claiming that mathematics is not entitled to its status as our most trusted knowledge.Surprising and counter-intuitive developments in formal logic and set theory early in the 20th century led to new questions concerning what was traditionally called the foundations of mathematics. As the century unfolded, the initial focus of concern expanded to an open exploration of the fundamental axioms of mathematics, the axiomatic approach having been taken for granted since the time of Euclid around 300 BCE as the natural basis for mathematics. Notions of axiom, proposition and proof, as well as the notion of a proposition being true of a mathematical object (see Assignment (mathematical logic)), were formalized, allowing them to be treated mathematically. The Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms for set theory were formulated which provided a conceptual framework in which much mathematical discourse would be interpreted. In mathematics, as in physics, new and unexpected ideas had arisen and significant changes were coming. With Gödel numbering, propositions could be interpreted as referring to themselves or other propositions, enabling inquiry into the consistency of mathematical theories. This reflective critique in which the theory under review "becomes itself the object of a mathematical study" led Hilbert to call such study metamathematics or proof theory.   At the middle of the century, a new mathematical theory was created by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane, known as category theory, and it became a new contender for the natural language of mathematical thinking.  As the 20th century progressed, however, philosophical opinions diverged as to just how well-founded were the questions about foundations that were raised at the century's beginning. Hilary Putnam summed up one common view of the situation in the last third of the century by saying: When philosophy discovers something wrong with science, sometimes science has to be changed—Russell's paradox comes to mind, as does Berkeley's attack on the actual infinitesimal—but more often it is philosophy that has to be changed. I do not think that the difficulties that philosophy finds with classical mathematics today are genuine difficulties; and I think that the philosophical interpretations of mathematics that we are being offered on every hand are wrong, and that "philosophical interpretation" is just what mathematics doesn't need.   Philosophy of mathematics today proceeds along several different lines of inquiry, by philosophers of mathematics, logicians, and mathematicians, and there are many schools of thought on the subject. The schools are addressed separately in the next section, and their assumptions explained.Major themes===Mathematical realism===  Mathematical realism, like realism in general, holds that mathematical entities exist independently of the human mind. Thus humans do not invent mathematics, but rather discover it, and any other intelligent beings in the universe would presumably do the same. In this point of view, there is really one sort of mathematics that can be discovered; triangles, for example, are real entities, not the creations of the human mind.Many working mathematicians have been mathematical realists; they see themselves as discoverers of naturally occurring objects. Examples include Paul Erdős and Kurt Gödel. Gödel believed in an objective mathematical reality that could be perceived in a manner analogous to sense perception. Certain principles (e.g., for any two objects, there is a collection of objects consisting of precisely those two objects) could be directly seen to be true, but the continuum hypothesis conjecture might prove undecidable just on the basis of such principles. Gödel suggested that quasi-empirical methodology could be used to provide sufficient evidence to be able to reasonably assume such a conjecture.Within realism, there are distinctions depending on what sort of existence one takes mathematical entities to have, and how we know about them. Major forms of mathematical realism include Platonism.Mathematical anti-realismMathematical anti-realism generally holds that mathematical statements have truth-values, but that they do not do so by corresponding to a special realm of immaterial or non-empirical entities. Major forms of mathematical anti-realism include Formalism and Fictionalism.Contemporary schools of thoughtPlatonism Mathematical Platonism is the form of realism that suggests that mathematical entities are abstract, have no spatiotemporal or causal properties, and are eternal and unchanging. This is often claimed to be the view most people have of numbers. The term Platonism is used because such a view is seen to parallel Plato's Theory of Forms and a "World of Ideas" (Greek: eidos (εἶδος)) described in Plato's allegory of the cave: the everyday world can only imperfectly approximate an unchanging, ultimate reality. Both Plato's cave and Platonism have meaningful, not just superficial connections, because Plato's ideas were preceded and probably influenced by the hugely popular Pythagoreans of ancient Greece, who believed that the world was, quite literally, generated by numbers.A major question considered in mathematical Platonism is: Precisely where and how do the mathematical entities exist, and how do we know about them? Is there a world, completely separate from our physical one, that is occupied by the mathematical entities? How can we gain access to this separate world and discover truths about the entities? One proposed answer is the Ultimate Ensemble, a theory that postulates that all structures that exist mathematically also exist physically in their own universe.Plato spoke of mathematics by: In context, chapter 8, of H.D.P. Lee's translation, reports the education of a philosopher contains five mathematical disciplines:mathematics;arithmetic, written in unit fraction "parts" using theoretical unities and abstract numbers;plane geometry and solid geometry also considered the line to be segmented into rational and irrational unit "parts";astronomyharmonicsTranslators  of the works of Plato rebelled against practical versions of his culture's practical mathematics. However, Plato himself and Greeks had copied 1,500 older Egyptian fraction abstract unities, one being a hekat unity scaled to (64/64) in the Akhmim Wooden Tablet, thereby not getting lost in fractions.Gödel's Platonism postulates a special kind of mathematical intuition that lets us perceive mathematical objects directly. (This view bears resemblances to many things Husserl said about mathematics, and supports Kant's idea that mathematics is synthetic a priori.) Davis and Hersh have suggested in their book The Mathematical Experience that most mathematicians act as though they are Platonists, even though, if pressed to defend the position carefully, they may retreat to formalism (see below).Some  mathematicians hold opinions that amount to more nuanced versions of Platonism.Full-blooded Platonism is a modern variation of Platonism, which is in reaction to the fact that different sets of mathematical entities can be proven to exist depending on the axioms and inference rules employed (for instance, the law of the excluded middle, and the axiom of choice). It holds that all mathematical entities exist, however they may be provable, even if they cannot all be derived from a single consistent set of axioms.Empiricism Empiricism is a form of realism that denies that mathematics can be known a priori at all. It says that we discover mathematical facts by empirical research, just like facts in any of the other sciences. It is not one of the classical three positions advocated in the early 20th century, but primarily arose in the middle of the century. However, an important early proponent of a view like this was John Stuart Mill. Mill's view was widely criticized, because, according to critics, such as A.J. Ayer,  it makes statements like   come out as uncertain, contingent truths, which we can only learn by observing instances of two pairs coming together and forming a quartet.Contemporary mathematical empiricism, formulated by Quine and Putnam, is primarily supported by the indispensability argument: mathematics is indispensable to all empirical sciences, and if we want to believe in the reality of the phenomena described by the sciences, we ought also believe in the reality of those entities required for this description. That is, since physics needs to talk about electrons to say why light bulbs behave as they do, then electrons must exist. Since physics needs to talk about numbers in offering any of its explanations, then numbers must exist. In keeping with Quine and Putnam's overall philosophies, this is a naturalistic argument. It argues for the existence of mathematical entities as the best explanation for experience, thus stripping mathematics of being distinct from the other sciences.Putnam strongly rejected the term "Platonist" as implying an over-specific ontology that was not necessary to mathematical practice in any real sense. He advocated a form of "pure realism" that rejected mystical notions of truth and accepted much quasi-empiricism in mathematics. Putnam was involved in coining the term "pure realism" (see below).The most important criticism of empirical views of mathematics is approximately the same as that raised against Mill. If mathematics is just as empirical as the other sciences, then this suggests that its results are just as fallible as theirs, and just as contingent. In Mill's case the empirical justification comes directly, while in Quine's case it comes indirectly, through the coherence of our scientific theory as a whole, i.e. consilience after E.O. Wilson. Quine suggests that mathematics seems completely certain because the role it plays in our web of belief is incredibly central, and that it would be extremely difficult for us to revise it, though not impossible.For a philosophy of mathematics that attempts to overcome some of the shortcomings of Quine and Gödel's approaches by taking aspects of each see Penelope Maddy's Realism in Mathematics. Another example of a realist theory is the embodied mind theory (below). For a modern revision of mathematical empiricism see new empiricism (below).For experimental evidence suggesting that human infants can do elementary arithmetic, see Brian Butterworth.Mathematical monismMax Tegmark's mathematical universe hypothesis goes further than Platonism in asserting that not only do all mathematical objects exist, but nothing else does. Tegmark's sole postulate is: All structures that exist mathematically also exist physically. That is, in the sense that "in those [worlds] complex enough to contain self-aware substructures [they] will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically 'real' world".    LogicismLogicism is the thesis that mathematics is reducible to logic, and hence nothing but a part of logic. Carnap, Rudolf (1931), "Die logizistische Grundlegung der Mathematik", Erkenntnis 2, 91-121. Republished, "The Logicist Foundations of Mathematics", E. Putnam and G.J. Massey (trans.), in Benacerraf and Putnam (1964). Reprinted, pp. 41–52 in Benacerraf and Putnam (1983).   Logicists hold that mathematics can be known a priori, but suggest that our knowledge of mathematics is just part of our knowledge of logic in general, and is thus analytic, not requiring any special faculty of mathematical intuition. In this view, logic is the proper foundation of mathematics, and all mathematical statements are necessary logical truths.Rudolf Carnap (1931) presents the logicist thesis in two parts: The concepts of mathematics can be derived from logical concepts through explicit definitions.The theorems of mathematics can be derived from logical axioms through purely logical deduction.Gottlob Frege was the founder of logicism. In his seminal Die Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (Basic Laws of Arithmetic) he built up arithmetic from a system of logic with a general principle of comprehension, which he called "Basic Law V" (for concepts F and G, the extension of F equals the extension of G if and only if for all objects a, Fa equals Ga), a principle that he took to be acceptable as part of logic.Frege's construction was flawed. Russell discovered that Basic Law V is inconsistent (this is Russell's paradox). Frege abandoned his logicist program soon after this, but it was continued by Russell and Whitehead. They attributed the paradox to "vicious circularity" and built up what they called ramified type theory to deal with it. In this system, they were eventually able to build up much of modern mathematics but in an altered, and excessively complex form (for example, there were different natural numbers in each type, and there were infinitely many types). They also had to make several compromises in order to develop so much of mathematics, such as an "axiom of reducibility". Even Russell said that this axiom did not really belong to logic.Modern logicists (like Bob Hale, Crispin Wright, and perhaps others) have returned to a program closer to Frege's. They have abandoned Basic Law V in favor of abstraction principles such as Hume's principle (the number of objects falling under the concept F equals the number of objects falling under the concept G if and only if the extension of F and the extension of G can be put into one-to-one correspondence). Frege required Basic Law V to be able to give an explicit definition of the numbers, but all the properties of numbers can be derived from Hume's principle. This would not have been enough for Frege because (to paraphrase him) it does not exclude the possibility that the number 3 is in fact Julius Caesar. In addition, many of the weakened principles that they have had to adopt to replace Basic Law V no longer seem so obviously analytic, and thus purely logical.Formalism  Formalism holds that mathematical statements may be thought of as statements about the consequences of certain string manipulation rules. For example, in the "game" of Euclidean geometry (which is seen as consisting of some strings called "axioms", and some "rules of inference" to generate new strings from given ones), one can prove that the Pythagorean theorem holds (that is, one can generate the string corresponding to the Pythagorean theorem). According to formalism, mathematical truths are not about numbers and sets and triangles and the like—in fact, they are not "about" anything at all.Another version of formalism is often known as deductivism. In deductivism, the Pythagorean theorem is not an absolute truth, but a relative one: if one assigns meaning to the strings in such a way that the rules of the game become true (i.e., true statements are assigned to the axioms and the rules of inference are truth-preserving), then one must accept the theorem, or, rather, the interpretation one has given it must be a true statement. The same is held to be true for all other mathematical statements. Thus, formalism need not mean that mathematics is nothing more than a meaningless symbolic game. It is usually hoped that there exists some interpretation in which the rules of the game hold. (Compare this position to structuralism.) But it does allow the working mathematician to continue in his or her work and leave such problems to the philosopher or scientist. Many formalists would say that in practice, the axiom systems to be studied will be suggested by the demands of science or other areas of mathematics.A major early proponent of formalism was David Hilbert, whose program was intended to be a complete and consistent axiomatization of all of mathematics. Hilbert aimed to show the consistency of mathematical systems from the assumption that the "finitary arithmetic" (a subsystem of the usual arithmetic of the positive integers, chosen to be philosophically uncontroversial) was consistent. Hilbert's goals of creating a system of mathematics that is both complete and consistent were seriously undermined by the second of Gödel's incompleteness theorems, which states that sufficiently expressive consistent axiom systems can never prove their own consistency. Since any such axiom system would contain the finitary arithmetic as a subsystem, Gödel's theorem implied that it would be impossible to prove the system's consistency relative to that (since it would then prove its own consistency, which Gödel had shown was impossible). Thus, in order to show that any axiomatic system of mathematics is in fact consistent, one needs to first assume the consistency of a system of mathematics that is in a sense stronger than the system to be proven consistent.Hilbert was initially a deductivist, but, as may be clear from above, he considered certain metamathematical methods to yield intrinsically meaningful results and was a realist with respect to the finitary arithmetic. Later, he held the opinion that there was no other meaningful mathematics whatsoever, regardless of interpretation.Other formalists, such as Rudolf Carnap, Alfred Tarski, and Haskell Curry, considered mathematics to be the investigation of formal axiom systems. Mathematical logicians study formal systems but are just as often realists as they are formalists.Formalists are relatively tolerant and inviting to new approaches to logic, non-standard number systems, new set theories etc. The more games we study, the better. However, in all three of these examples, motivation is drawn from existing mathematical or philosophical concerns. The "games" are usually not arbitrary.The main critique of formalism is that the actual mathematical ideas that occupy mathematicians are far removed from the string manipulation games mentioned above. Formalism is thus silent on the question of which axiom systems ought to be studied, as none is more meaningful than another from a formalistic point of view.Recently, some  formalist mathematicians have proposed that all of our formal mathematical knowledge should be systematically encoded in computer-readable formats, so as to facilitate automated proof checking of mathematical proofs and the use of interactive theorem proving in the development of mathematical theories and computer software. Because of their close connection with computer science, this idea is also advocated by mathematical intuitionists and constructivists in the "computability" tradition (see below). See QED project for a general overview.ConventionalismThe French mathematician Henri Poincaré was among the first to articulate a conventionalist view. Poincaré's use of non-Euclidean geometries in his work on differential equations convinced him that Euclidean geometry should not be regarded as a priori truth. He held that axioms in geometry should be chosen for the results they produce, not for their apparent coherence with human intuitions about the physical world.PsychologismPsychologism in the philosophy of mathematics is the position that mathematical concepts and/or truths are grounded in, derived from or explained by psychological facts (or laws).John Stuart Mill seems to have been an advocate of a type of logical psychologism, as were many 19th-century German logicians such as Sigwart and Erdmann as well as a number of psychologists, past and present: for example, Gustave Le Bon. Psychologism was famously criticized by Frege in his The Foundations of Arithmetic, and many of his works and essays, including his review of Husserl's Philosophy of Arithmetic. Edmund Husserl, in the first volume of his Logical Investigations, called "The Prolegomena of Pure Logic", criticized psychologism thoroughly and sought to distance himself from it. The "Prolegomena" is considered a more concise, fair, and thorough refutation of psychologism than the criticisms made by Frege, and also it is considered today by many as being a memorable refutation for its decisive blow to psychologism. Psychologism was also criticized by Charles Sanders Peirce and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.Intuitionism In mathematics, intuitionism is a program of methodological reform whose motto is that "there are no non-experienced mathematical truths" (L.E.J. Brouwer). From this springboard, intuitionists seek to reconstruct what they consider to be the corrigible portion of mathematics in accordance with Kantian concepts of being, becoming, intuition, and knowledge. Brouwer, the founder of the movement, held that mathematical objects arise from the a priori forms of the volitions that inform the perception of empirical objects. A major force behind intuitionism was L.E.J. Brouwer, who rejected the usefulness of formalized logic of any sort for mathematics. His student Arend Heyting postulated an intuitionistic logic, different from the classical Aristotelian logic; this logic does not contain the law of the excluded middle and therefore frowns upon proofs by contradiction. The axiom of choice is also rejected in most intuitionistic set theories, though in some versions it is accepted. Important work was later done by Errett Bishop, who managed to prove versions of the most important theorems in real analysis within this framework.In intuitionism, the term "explicit construction" is not cleanly defined, and that has led to criticisms. Attempts have been made to use the concepts of Turing machine or computable function to fill this gap, leading to the claim that only questions regarding the behavior of finite algorithms are meaningful and should be investigated in mathematics. This has led to the study of the computable numbers, first introduced by Alan Turing. Not surprisingly, then, this approach to mathematics is sometimes associated with theoretical computer science.Constructivism  Like intuitionism, constructivism involves the regulative principle that only mathematical entities which can be explicitly constructed in a certain sense should be admitted to mathematical discourse. In this view, mathematics is an exercise of the human intuition, not a game played with meaningless symbols. Instead, it is about entities that we can create directly through mental activity. In addition, some adherents of these schools reject non-constructive proofs, such as a proof by contradiction.FinitismFinitism is an extreme form of constructivism, according to which a mathematical object does not exist unless it can be constructed from natural numbers in a finite number of steps. In her book Philosophy of Set Theory, Mary Tiles characterized those who allow countably infinite objects as classical finitists, and those who deny even countably infinite objects as strict finitists.The most famous proponent of finitism was Leopold Kronecker, From an 1886 lecture at the 'Berliner Naturforscher-Versammlung', according to H. M. Weber's memorial article, as quoted and translated in  Gonzalez gives as the sources for the memorial article, the following: Weber, H: "Leopold Kronecker", Jahresberichte der Deutschen Mathematiker Vereinigung, vol ii (1893), pp. 5-31. Cf. page 19. See also Mathematische Annalen vol. xliii (1893), pp. 1-25.  who said: Ultrafinitism is an even more extreme version of finitism, which rejects not only infinities but finite quantities that cannot feasibly be constructed with available resources. Another variant of finitism is "Euclidean Arithmetic", a system developed by John Penn Mayberry in his book The Foundations of Mathematics in the Theory of Sets.    Mayberry's system is Aristotelian in general inspiration and, despite his strong rejection of any role for operationalism or feasibility in the foundations of mathematics, comes to somewhat similar conclusions, such as, for instance, that super-exponentiation is not a legitimate finitary function.Structuralism Structuralism is a position holding that mathematical theories describe structures, and that mathematical objects are exhaustively defined by their places in such structures, consequently having no intrinsic properties. For instance, it would maintain that all that needs to be known about the number 1 is that it is the first whole number after 0. Likewise all the other whole numbers are defined by their places in a structure, the number line. Other examples of mathematical objects might include lines and planes in geometry, or elements and operations in abstract algebra.Structuralism is an epistemologically realistic view in that it holds that mathematical statements have an objective truth value. However, its central claim only relates to what kind of entity a mathematical object is, not to what kind of existence mathematical objects or structures have (not, in other words, to their ontology). The kind of existence mathematical objects have would clearly be dependent on that of the structures in which they are embedded; different sub-varieties of structuralism make different ontological claims in this regard. The Ante Rem, or fully realist, variation of structuralism has a similar ontology to Platonism in that structures are held to have a real but abstract and immaterial existence. As such, it faces the usual problems of explaining the interaction between such abstract structures and flesh-and-blood mathematicians.In Re, or moderately realistic, structuralism is the equivalent of Aristotelian realism. Structures are held to exist inasmuch as some concrete system exemplifies them. This incurs the usual issues that some perfectly legitimate structures might accidentally happen not to exist, and that a finite physical world might not be "big" enough to accommodate some otherwise legitimate structures.The Post Res or eliminative variant of structuralism is anti-realist about structures in a way that parallels nominalism. According to this view mathematical systems exist, and have structural features in common. If something is true of a structure, it will be true of all systems exemplifying the structure. However, it is merely convenient to talk of structures being "held in common" between systems: they in fact have no independent existence.Embodied mind theoriesEmbodied mind theories hold that mathematical thought is a natural outgrowth of the human cognitive apparatus which finds itself in our physical universe. For example, the abstract concept of number springs from the experience of counting discrete objects. It is held that mathematics is not universal and does not exist in any real sense, other than in human brains. Humans construct, but do not discover, mathematics.With this view, the physical universe can thus be seen as the ultimate foundation of mathematics: it guided the evolution of the brain and later determined which questions this brain would find worthy of investigation. However, the human mind has no special claim on reality or approaches to it built out of math. If such constructs as Euler's identity are true then they are true as a map of the human mind and cognition.Embodied mind theorists thus explain the effectiveness of mathematics—mathematics was constructed by the brain in order to be effective in this universe.The most accessible, famous, and infamous treatment of this perspective is Where Mathematics Comes From, by George Lakoff and Rafael E. Núñez. In addition, mathematician Keith Devlin has investigated similar concepts with his book The Math Instinct, as has neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene with his book The Number Sense. For more on the philosophical ideas that inspired this perspective, see cognitive science of mathematics.New empiricismA more recent empiricism returns to the principle of the English empiricists of the 18th and 19th centuries, in particular John Stuart Mill, who asserted that all knowledge comes to us from observation through the senses. This applies not only to matters of fact, but also to "relations of ideas", as Hume called them: the structures of logic which interpret, organize and abstract observations.To this principle it adds a materialist connection: all the processes of logic which interpret, organize and abstract observations, are physical phenomena which take place in real time and physical space: namely, in the brains of human beings. Abstract objects, such as mathematical objects, are ideas, which in turn exist as electrical and chemical states of the billions of neurons in the human brain.This second concept is reminiscent of the social constructivist approach, which holds that mathematics is produced by humans rather than being "discovered" from abstract, a priori truths. However, it differs sharply from the constructivist implication that humans arbitrarily construct mathematical principles that have no inherent truth but which instead are created on a conveniency basis. On the contrary, new empiricism shows how mathematics, although constructed by humans, follows rules and principles that will be agreed on by all who participate in the process, with the result that everyone practicing mathematics comes up with the same answer—except in those areas where there is philosophical disagreement on the meaning of fundamental concepts. This is because the new empiricism perceives this agreement as being a physical phenomenon, one which is observed by other humans in the same way that other physical phenomena, like the motions of inanimate bodies, or the chemical interaction of various elements, are observed.Combining the materialist principle with Millisian epistemology evades the principal difficulty with classical empiricism—that all knowledge comes from the senses. That difficulty lies in the observation that mathematical truths based on logical deduction appear to be more certainly true than knowledge of the physical world itself. (The physical world in this case is taken to mean the portion of it lying outside the human brain.)Kant argued that the structures of logic which organize, interpret and abstract observations were built into the human mind and were true and valid a priori. Mill, on the contrary, said that we believe them to be true because we have enough individual instances of their truth to generalize: in his words, "From instances we have observed, we feel warranted in concluding that what we found true in those instances holds in all similar ones, past, present and future, however numerous they may be".  Although the psychological or epistemological specifics given by Mill through which we build our logical apparatus may not be completely warranted, his explanation still nonetheless manages to demonstrate that there is no way around Kant's a priori logic. To recant Mill's original idea in an empiricist twist: "Indeed, the very principles of logical deduction are true because we observe that using them leads to true conclusions", which is itself an a priori presupposition.If all this is true, then where do the world senses come in? The early empiricists all stumbled over this point. Hume asserted that all knowledge comes from the senses, and then gave away the ballgame by excepting abstract propositions, which he called "relations of ideas". These, he said, were absolutely true (although the mathematicians who thought them up, being human, might get them wrong). Mill, on the other hand, tried to deny that abstract ideas exist outside the physical world: all numbers, he said, "must be numbers of something: there are no such things as numbers in the abstract". When we count to eight or add five and three we are really counting spoons or bumblebees. "All things possess quantity", he said, so that propositions concerning numbers are propositions concerning "all things whatever". But then in almost a contradiction of himself he went on to acknowledge that numerical and algebraic expressions are not necessarily attached to real world objects: they "do not excite in our minds ideas of any things in particular". Mill's low reputation as a philosopher of logic, and the low estate of empiricism in the century and a half following him, derives from this failed attempt to link abstract thoughts to the physical world, when it may be more plausibly arguable that abstraction consists precisely of separating the thought from its physical foundations.The conundrum created by our certainty that abstract deductive propositions, if valid (i.e. if we can "prove" them), are true, exclusive of observation and testing in the physical world, gives rise to a further reflection ... What if thoughts themselves, and the minds that create them, are physical objects, existing only in the physical world?This would reconcile the contradiction between our belief in the certainty of abstract deductions and the empiricist principle that knowledge comes from observation of individual instances. We know that Euler's equation is true because every time a human mind derives the equation, it gets the same result, unless it has made a mistake, which can be acknowledged and corrected. We observe this phenomenon, and we extrapolate to the general proposition that it is always true.This applies not only to physical principles, like the law of gravity, but to abstract phenomena that we observe only in human brains: in ours and in those of others.Aristotelian realism Similar to empiricism in emphasizing the relation of mathematics to the real world, Aristotelian realism holds that mathematics studies properties such as symmetry, continuity and order that can be literally realized in the physical world (or in any other world there might be). It contrasts with Platonism in holding that the objects of mathematics, such as numbers, do not exist in an "abstract" world but can be physically realized. For example, the number 4 is realized in the relation between a heap of parrots and the universal "being a parrot" that divides the heap into so many parrots. Franklin, James (2014), "An Aristotelian Realist Philosophy of Mathematics", Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke; Franklin, James (2011), "Aristotelianism in the philosophy of mathematics," Studia Neoaristotelica 8, 3-15.  Aristotelian realism is defended by James Franklin and the Sydney School in the philosophy of mathematics and is close to the view of Penelope Maddy that when an egg carton is opened, a set of three eggs is perceived (that is, a mathematical entity realized in the physical world). Maddy, Penelope (1990), Realism in Mathematics, Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK.  A problem for Aristotelian realism is what account to give of higher infinities, which may not be realizable in the physical world.The Euclidean Arithmetic developed by John Penn Mayberry in his book The Foundations of Mathematics in the Theory of Sets.  also falls into the Aristotelian realist tradition. Mayberry, following Euclid, considers numbers to be simply "definite multitudes of units" realized in nature—such as "the members of the London Symphony Orchestra" or "the trees in Birnam wood". Whether or not there are definite multitudes of units for which Euclid's Common Notion 5 (the Whole is greater than the Part) fails and which would consequently be reckoned as infinite is for Mayberry essentially a question about Nature and does not entail any transcendental suppositions.Fictionalism   Fictionalism  in mathematics was brought to fame in 1980 when Hartry Field published Science Without Numbers, which rejected and in fact reversed Quine's indispensability argument. Where Quine suggested that mathematics was indispensable for our best scientific theories, and therefore should be accepted as a body of truths talking about independently existing entities, Field suggested that mathematics was dispensable, and therefore should be considered as a body of falsehoods not talking about anything real. He did this by giving a complete axiomatization of Newtonian mechanics with no reference to numbers or functions at all. He started with the "betweenness" of Hilbert's axioms to characterize space without coordinatizing it, and then added extra relations between points to do the work formerly done by vector fields. Hilbert's geometry is mathematical, because it talks about abstract points, but in Field's theory, these points are the concrete points of physical space, so no special mathematical objects at all are needed.Having shown how to do science without using numbers, Field proceeded to rehabilitate mathematics as a kind of useful fiction. He showed that mathematical physics is a conservative extension of his non-mathematical physics (that is, every physical fact provable in mathematical physics is already provable from Field's system), so that mathematics is a reliable process whose physical applications are all true, even though its own statements are false. Thus, when doing mathematics, we can see ourselves as telling a sort of story, talking as if numbers existed. For Field, a statement like   is just as fictitious as "Sherlock Holmes lived at 221B Baker Street"—but both are true according to the relevant fictions.By this account, there are no metaphysical or epistemological problems special to mathematics. The only worries left are the general worries about non-mathematical physics, and about fiction in general. Field's approach has been very influential, but is widely rejected. This is in part because of the requirement of strong fragments of second-order logic to carry out his reduction, and because the statement of conservativity seems to require quantification over abstract models or deductions.Social constructivism or social realismSocial constructivism or social realism theories see mathematics primarily as a social construct, as a product of culture, subject to correction and change. Like the other sciences, mathematics is viewed as an empirical endeavor whose results are constantly evaluated and may be discarded. However, while on an empiricist view the evaluation is some sort of comparison with "reality", social constructivists emphasize that the direction of mathematical research is dictated by the fashions of the social group performing it or by the needs of the society financing it. However, although such external forces may change the direction of some mathematical research, there are strong internal constraints—the mathematical traditions, methods, problems, meanings and values into which mathematicians are enculturated—that work to conserve the historically-defined discipline.This runs counter to the traditional beliefs of working mathematicians, that mathematics is somehow pure or objective. But social constructivists argue that mathematics is in fact grounded by much uncertainty: as mathematical practice evolves, the status of previous mathematics is cast into doubt, and is corrected to the degree it is required or desired by the current mathematical community. This can be seen in the development of analysis from reexamination of the calculus of Leibniz and Newton. They argue further that finished mathematics is often accorded too much status, and folk mathematics not enough, due to an overemphasis on axiomatic proof and peer review as practices. However, this might be seen as merely saying that rigorously proven results are overemphasized, and then "look how chaotic and uncertain the rest of it all is!"The social nature of mathematics is highlighted in its subcultures. Major discoveries can be made in one branch of mathematics and be relevant to another, yet the relationship goes undiscovered for lack of social contact between mathematicians. Social constructivists argue each speciality forms its own epistemic community and often has great difficulty communicating, or motivating the investigation of unifying conjectures that might relate different areas of mathematics. Social constructivists see the process of "doing mathematics" as actually creating the meaning, while social realists see a deficiency either of human capacity to abstractify, or of human's cognitive bias, or of mathematicians' collective intelligence as preventing the comprehension of a real universe of mathematical objects. Social constructivists sometimes reject the search for foundations of mathematics as bound to fail, as pointless or even meaningless.Contributions to this school have been made by Imre Lakatos and Thomas Tymoczko, although it is not clear that either would endorse the title.  More recently Paul Ernest has explicitly formulated a social constructivist philosophy of mathematics.  Some consider the work of Paul Erdős as a whole to have advanced this view (although he personally rejected it) because of his uniquely broad collaborations, which prompted others to see and study "mathematics as a social activity", e.g., via the Erdős number. Reuben Hersh has also promoted the social view of mathematics, calling it a "humanistic" approach,  similar to but not quite the same as that associated with Alvin White;  one of Hersh's co-authors, Philip J. Davis, has expressed sympathy for the social view as well.A criticism of this approach is that it is trivial, based on the trivial observation that mathematics is a human activity. To observe that rigorous proof comes only after unrigorous conjecture, experimentation and speculation is true, but it is trivial and no-one would deny this. So it's a bit of a stretch to characterize a philosophy of mathematics in this way, on something trivially true. The calculus of Leibniz and Newton was reexamined by mathematicians such as Weierstrass in order to rigorously prove the theorems thereof. There is nothing special or interesting about this, as it fits in with the more general trend of unrigorous ideas which are later made rigorous. There needs to be a clear distinction between the objects of study of mathematics and the study of the objects of study of mathematics. The former doesn't seem to change a great deal;  the latter is forever in flux. The latter is what the social theory is about, and the former is what Platonism et al. are about.However, this criticism is rejected by supporters of the social constructivist perspective because it misses the point that the very objects of mathematics are social constructs. These objects, it asserts, are primarily semiotic objects existing in the sphere of human culture, sustained by social practices (after Wittgenstein) that utilize physically embodied signs and give rise to intrapersonal (mental) constructs. Social constructivists view the reification of the sphere of human culture into a Platonic realm, or some other heaven-like domain of existence beyond the physical world, a long-standing category error.Beyond the traditional schools Rather than focus on narrow debates about the true nature of mathematical truth, or even on practices unique to mathematicians such as the proof, a growing movement from the 1960s to the 1990s began to question the idea of seeking foundations or finding any one right answer to why mathematics works. The starting point for this was Eugene Wigner's famous 1960 paper The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences, in which he argued that the happy coincidence of mathematics and physics being so well matched seemed to be unreasonable and hard to explain.The embodied-mind or cognitive school and the social school were responses to this challenge, but the debates raised were difficult to confine to those.Quasi-empiricismOne parallel concern that does not actually challenge the schools directly but instead questions their focus is the notion of quasi-empiricism in mathematics. This grew from the increasingly popular assertion in the late 20th century that no one foundation of mathematics could be ever proven to exist. It is also sometimes called "postmodernism in mathematics" although that term is considered overloaded by some and insulting by others. Quasi-empiricism argues that in doing their research, mathematicians test hypotheses as well as prove theorems. A mathematical argument can transmit falsity from the conclusion to the premises just as well as it can transmit truth from the premises to the conclusion. Quasi-empiricism was developed by Imre Lakatos, inspired by the philosophy of science of Karl Popper.Lakatos' philosophy of mathematics is sometimes regarded as a kind of social constructivism, but this was not his intention.Such methods have always been part of folk mathematics by which great feats of calculation and measurement are sometimes achieved. Indeed, such methods may be the only notion of proof a culture has.Hilary Putnam has argued that any theory of mathematical realism would include quasi-empirical methods. He proposed that an alien species doing mathematics might well rely on quasi-empirical methods primarily, being willing often to forgo rigorous and axiomatic proofs, and still be doing mathematics—at perhaps a somewhat greater risk of failure of their calculations. He gave a detailed argument for this in New Directions. Popper's "two senses" theoryRealist and constructivist theories are normally taken to be contraries. However, Karl Popper  argued that a number statement such as   can be taken in two senses. In one sense it is irrefutable and logically true. In the second sense it is factually true and falsifiable. Another way of putting this is to say that a single number statement can express two propositions: one of which can be explained on constructivist lines; the other on realist lines. Language Innovations in the philosophy of language during the 20th century renewed interest in whether mathematics is, as is often said, the language of science. Although some mathematicians and philosophers would accept the statement "mathematics is a language", linguists believe that the implications of such a statement must be considered. For example, the tools of linguistics are not generally applied to the symbol systems of mathematics, that is, mathematics is studied in a markedly different way from other languages. If mathematics is a language, it is a different type of language from natural languages. Indeed, because of the need for clarity and specificity, the language of mathematics is far more constrained than natural languages studied by linguists. However, the methods developed by Frege and Tarski for the study of mathematical language have been extended greatly by Tarski's student Richard Montague and other linguists working in formal semantics to show that the distinction between mathematical language and natural language may not be as great as it seems.ArgumentsIndispensability argument for realism This argument, associated with Willard Quine and Hilary Putnam, is considered by Stephen Yablo to be one of the most challenging arguments in favor of the acceptance of the existence of abstract mathematical entities, such as numbers and sets.    The form of the argument is as follows.One must have ontological commitments to all entities that are indispensable to the best scientific theories, and to those entities only (commonly referred to as "all and only").Mathematical entities are indispensable to the best scientific theories. Therefore,One must have ontological commitments to mathematical entities. Putnam, H. Mathematics, Matter and Method. Philosophical Papers, vol. 1. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975. 2nd. ed., 1985. The justification for the first premise is the most controversial. Both Putnam and Quine invoke naturalism to justify the exclusion of all non-scientific entities, and hence to defend the "only" part of "all and only". The assertion that "all" entities postulated in scientific theories, including numbers, should be accepted as real is justified by confirmation holism. Since theories are not confirmed in a piecemeal fashion, but as a whole, there is no justification for excluding any of the entities referred to in well-confirmed theories. This puts the nominalist who wishes to exclude the existence of sets and non-Euclidean geometry, but to include the existence of quarks and other undetectable entities of physics, for example, in a difficult position. Epistemic argument against realismThe anti-realist "epistemic argument" against Platonism has been made by Paul Benacerraf and Hartry Field. Platonism posits that mathematical objects are abstract entities. By general agreement, abstract entities cannot interact causally with concrete, physical entities ("the truth-values of our mathematical assertions depend on facts involving Platonic entities that reside in a realm outside of space-time" ). Whilst our knowledge of concrete, physical objects is based on our ability to perceive them, and therefore to causally interact with them, there is no parallel account of how mathematicians come to have knowledge of abstract objects.    Another way of making the point is that if the Platonic world were to disappear, it would make no difference to the ability of mathematicians to generate proofs, etc., which is already fully accountable in terms of physical processes in their brains.Field developed his views into fictionalism. Benacerraf also developed the philosophy of mathematical structuralism, according to which there are no mathematical objects. Nonetheless, some versions of structuralism are compatible with some versions of realism.The argument hinges on the idea that a satisfactory naturalistic account of thought processes in terms of brain processes can be given for mathematical reasoning along with everything else. One line of defense is to maintain that this is false, so that mathematical reasoning uses some special intuition that involves contact with the Platonic realm. A modern form of this argument is given by Sir Roger Penrose. Another line of defense is to maintain that abstract objects are relevant to mathematical reasoning in a way that is non-causal, and not analogous to perception. This argument is developed by Jerrold Katz in his book Realistic Rationalism.A more radical defense is denial of physical reality, i.e. the mathematical universe hypothesis. In that case, a mathematician's knowledge of mathematics is one mathematical object making contact with another.Aesthetics Many practicing mathematicians have been drawn to their subject because of a sense of beauty they perceive in it. One sometimes hears the sentiment that mathematicians would like to leave philosophy to the philosophers and get back to mathematics—where, presumably, the beauty lies.In his work on the divine proportion, H.E. Huntley relates the feeling of reading and understanding someone else's proof of a theorem of mathematics to that of a viewer of a masterpiece of art—the reader of a proof has a similar sense of exhilaration at understanding as the original author of the proof, much as, he argues, the viewer of a masterpiece has a sense of exhilaration similar to the original painter or sculptor. Indeed, one can study mathematical and scientific writings as literature.Philip J. Davis and Reuben Hersh have commented that the sense of mathematical beauty is universal amongst practicing mathematicians. By way of example, they provide two proofs of the irrationality of  . The first is the traditional proof by contradiction, ascribed to Euclid; the second is a more direct proof involving the fundamental theorem of arithmetic that, they argue, gets to the heart of the issue. Davis and Hersh argue that mathematicians find the second proof more aesthetically appealing because it gets closer to the nature of the problem.Paul Erdős was well known for his notion of a hypothetical "Book" containing the most elegant or beautiful mathematical proofs. There is not universal agreement that a result has one "most elegant" proof; Gregory Chaitin has argued against this idea.Philosophers have sometimes criticized mathematicians' sense of beauty or elegance as being, at best, vaguely stated. By the same token, however, philosophers of mathematics have sought to characterize what makes one proof more desirable than another when both are logically sound.Another aspect of aesthetics concerning mathematics is mathematicians' views towards the possible uses of mathematics for purposes deemed unethical or inappropriate. The best-known exposition of this view occurs in G.H. Hardy's book A Mathematician's Apology, in which Hardy argues that pure mathematics is superior in beauty to applied mathematics precisely because it cannot be used for war and similar ends.See also  Axiomatic set theoryAxiomatic systemCategory theoryDefinitions of mathematicsFormal languageFormal systemFoundations of mathematicsGolden ratio History of mathematicsIntuitionistic logicLogicMathematical beautyMathematical constructivismMathematical logicMathematical proofMathematicism MetamathematicsModel theoryNaive set theoryNon-standard analysisPhilosophy of languagePhilosophy of sciencePhilosophy of PhysicsPhilosophy of probabilityProof theory Rule of inferenceScience studiesScientific methodSet theoryThe Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural SciencesTruth Related works  The AnalystEuclid's ElementsGödel's completeness theoremIntroduction to Mathematical Philosophy New FoundationsPrincipia MathematicaThe Simplest Mathematics Historical topicsHistory and philosophy of scienceHistory of mathematicsHistory of philosophyNotes Further reading Aristotle, "Prior Analytics", Hugh Tredennick (trans.), pp. 181–531 in Aristotle, Volume 1, Loeb Classical Library, William Heinemann, London, UK, 1938.Benacerraf, Paul, and Putnam, Hilary (eds., 1983), Philosophy of Mathematics, Selected Readings, 1st edition, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1964. 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1983.Berkeley, George (1734), The Analyst; or, a Discourse Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician.

Assassins (musical)<====>46442<====>Assassins (musical)  Assassins is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by John Weidman, based on an idea by Charles Gilbert, Jr.  It uses the premise of a murderous carnival game to produce a revue-style portrayal of men and women who attempted (successfully or not) to assassinate Presidents of the United States.  The music varies to reflect the popular music of the eras depicted. The musical first opened Off-Broadway in 1990, and the 2004 Broadway production won five Tony Awards. History and productionsAs a panelist at producer Stuart Ostrow's Musical Theater Lab, Sondheim read a script by playwright Charles Gilbert, Jr. 

Prime Directive<====>46446<====>Prime Directive  In the fictional universe of Star Trek, the Prime Directive (also known as Starfleet General Order 1 or General Order 1 ) is a guiding principle of the United Federation of Planets prohibiting the protagonists from interfering with the internal development of alien civilizations.   The Prime Directive has been used in five of the six Star Trek-based series.  This conceptual law applies particularly to civilizations which are below a certain threshold of technological, scientific and cultural development; preventing starship crews from using their superior technology to impose their own values or ideals on them. 

Scotch broth<====>46447<====>Scotch broth Scotch broth is a filling soup, originating in Scotland but now obtainable worldwide. The principal ingredients are usually barley, stewing or braising cuts of lamb, mutton or  beef, root vegetables (such as carrots, swedes, or sometimes turnips), and dried pulses (most often split peas and red lentils). Cabbage and leeks are often added shortly before serving to preserve their texture, colour and flavours. The proportions and ingredients vary according to the recipe or availability.   Scotch broth has been sold ready-prepared in cans for many years. See also CawlIrish stewLancashire hotpotList of lamb dishesList of soupsScouse (food)References  DEFAULTSORT   

Corn soup<====>46455<====>Corn soup  Corn soup is a soup made of corn (typically sweetcorn).  It was normally made in corn-producing areas of the world, but is now widespread because of greater corn distribution.  The basic recipe is some type of soup base with corn added followed by whatever ingredients give it its distinct style.  Typically ingredients are corn cut from the cob, water, butter, some flour, an egg, with salt and pepper for seasoning — this varies by region. Native AmericansCorn, being a staple crop for many Native American tribes has led to corn soup being a primary food among them. 

Clam soup<====>46459<====>Clam soupClam soup is a soup prepared using clams as a primary ingredient.  Clam soup can be prepared as a thin, broth- or cream/milk-based soup and as a thicker, chowder-style soup.  In Japan, hot miso soup prepared with clams is believed by some to be a cure for the hangover. OverviewClam soup is prepared using clams as a main ingredient.  Additional ingredients can include carrot, celery, onion and other vegetables, vegetable broth or stock or other types of broths and stocks (such as fish stock)  seasonings and spices, salt and pepper.  Fresh or canned clams can be used to prepare the dish. 

Chicken soup<====>46461<====>Chicken soup    Chicken soup is a soup made from chicken, simmered in water, usually with various other ingredients.  The classic chicken soup consists of a clear chicken broth, often with pieces of chicken or vegetables; common additions are pasta, dumplings, or grains such as rice and barley.  Chicken soup has acquired the reputation of a folk remedy for colds and influenza, and in many countries is considered a comfort food. PreparationVariations on the flavor are gained by adding root vegetables such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root, herbs such as parsley, dill, other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves or tomatoes and black pepper. 

Image compression<====>46469<====>Image compression  Image compression is a type of data compression applied to digital images, to reduce their cost for storage or transmission.  Algorithms may take advantage of visual perception and the statistical properties of image data to provide superior results compared with generic compression methods.  Lossy and lossless image compressionImage compression may be lossy or lossless.   Lossless compression is preferred for archival purposes and often for medical imaging, technical drawings, clip art, or comics.  Lossy compression methods, especially when used at low bit rates, introduce compression artifacts.   Lossy methods are especially suitable for natural images such as photographs in applications where minor (sometimes imperceptible) loss of fidelity is acceptable to achieve a substantial reduction in bit rate. 

Crop rotation<====>46470<====>Crop rotation   Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of dissimilar or different types of crops in the same area in sequenced seasons.  It is done so that the soil of farms is not used for only one set of nutrients. It helps in reducing soil erosion and increases soil fertility and crop yield. Growing the same crop in the same place for many years in a row (Monocropping) disproportionately depletes the soil of certain nutrients.  With rotation, a crop that leaches the soil of one kind of nutrient is followed during the next growing season by a dissimilar crop that returns that nutrient to the soil or draws a different ratio of nutrients. 

Drawn butter<====>46471<====>Drawn butter Drawn butter is melted butter,  Damon Fowler, Classical Southern Cooking, annotated edition, 2008, p.  113  often served as a sauce for steamed seafood.  Some cooks restrict the term to clarified butter;  while others insist that it should not be clarified.  When it is served with seafood, diners often add lemon juice to it. Drawn butter saucesIn the 18th century, a small amount of flour and water or milk was often added to melted butter to thicken it and prevent it from separating.  Later in the 19th century, increasing amounts of flour and water were used. 

Fish sauce<====>46482<====>Fish sauce Fish sauce is a condiment made from fermented fish and salt.  It is used as a staple ingredient in various cuisines in Southeast and East Asia, particularly Burmese, Cambodian, Filipino, Thai, Lao and Vietnamese cuisines.  Historically, it was also used in Ancient Greek and in Roman cuisine (known as garum). Fish sauce is added to dishes during the cooking process as well as being used as a base in dipping sauces.  Fish sauce and its derivatives impart an umami flavor to food due to its glutamate content.  IngredientsFish sauces may be prepared from different species of fish and shellfish, and from using the whole fish, or by using just fish blood or viscera. 

Apple sauce<====>46484<====>Apple sauce Apple sauce or applesauce is a sauce made of apples.  It can be made with peeled or unpeeled apples and a variety of spices (commonly cinnamon and allspice).  Flavorings or sweeteners such as sugar or honey are also commonly added.  Apple sauce is inexpensive and is widely used in North America and some European countries.  It can be substituted for fat (e. g.  butter/oil) in baking.    Commercial versions of apple sauce are readily available in supermarkets.   It may be packaged in several ways, including: glass jars, tins, or plastic tubs. 

Convention on the Rights of the Child<====>46489<====>Convention on the Rights of the Child    The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (commonly abbreviated as the CRC or UNCRC) is a human rights treaty which sets out the civil, political, economic, social, health and cultural rights of children.  The Convention defines a child as any human being under the age of eighteen, unless the age of majority is attained earlier under national legislation.  Nations that ratify this convention are bound to it by international law.  Compliance is monitored by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which is composed of members from countries around the world. 

Maryland Toleration Act<====>46493<====>Maryland Toleration Act  The Maryland Toleration Act, also known as the Act Concerning Religion, was a law mandating religious tolerance for Trinitarian Christians.  It was passed on April 21, 1649, by the assembly of the Maryland colony, in St.  Mary's City.  It was the second law requiring religious tolerance in the British North American colonies and created one of the pioneer statutes passed by the legislative body of an organized colonial government to guarantee any degree of religious liberty.  Specifically, the bill, now usually referred to as the Toleration Act, granted freedom of conscience to all Christians. 

Child Soldiers International<====>46494<====>Child Soldiers International Child Soldiers International,  formerly the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, is a UK-based non-governmental organization that works to prevent the recruitment, use and exploitation of children by armed forces and groups. VisionChild Soldiers International envisions a world where all children grow up realising their full potential and enjoying all their human rights.  For this to be possible, Child Soldiers International is working to prevent armed forces and groups from recruiting, using and exploiting children. HistoryFormerly the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers,  Child Soldiers International was founded in 1998 by leading human rights and humanitarian organisations, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Save the Children. 

Mount Fuji<====>46496<====>Mount Fuji, located on Honshu Island, is the highest mountain in Japan at 3,776. 24 m (12,389 ft).   It is an active stratovolcano that last erupted in 1707–1708.    Mount Fuji lies about 100 kilometres (60 mi) south-west of Tokyo, and can be seen from there on a clear day.  Mount Fuji's exceptionally symmetrical cone, which is snow-capped for about 5 months a year, is a well-known symbol of Japan and it is frequently depicted in art and photographs, as well as visited by sightseers and climbers.    Mount Fuji is one of Japan's   along with Mount Tate and Mount Haku. 

DARPA TIDES program<====>46504<====>DARPA TIDES program TIDES is an ambitious technology development effort, funded by DARPA.  It stands for Translingual Information Detection, Extraction and Summarization.  It is focused on the automated processing and understanding of a variety of human language data.   The primary goal is to make it possible for English speakers to find and interpret needed information quickly and effectively regardless of language or medium. OverviewTo provide that overall capability, TIDES is intended to develop a suite of robust, powerful, broadly useful component capabilities; integrate those components effectively in technology demonstration systems; and experiment with the systems on real-world problems. 

Airplane!<====>46505<====>Airplane!    Airplane! (alternatively titled Flying High!)    is a 1980 American satirical parody film written and directed by David and Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams,    and produced by Jon Davison.  It stars Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty and features Leslie Nielsen, Robert Stack, Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Lorna Patterson.   The film is a parody of the disaster film genre, particularly the 1957 Paramount film Zero Hour!, from which it borrows the plot and the central characters,    as well as many elements from Airport 1975.

These leaders serve as the chief Senate spokespeople for the political parties respectively holding the majority and the minority in the United States Senate, and manage and schedule the legislative and executive business of the Senate.  They are elected to their positions in the Senate by their respective party caucuses, the Senate Democratic Caucus and the Senate Republican Conference. By rule, the Presiding Officer gives the Majority Leader priority in obtaining recognition to speak on the floor of the Senate. 

National Academy of Sciences<====>46510<====>National Academy of Sciences  The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is a United States nonprofit, non-governmental organization.  NAS is part of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, along with the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and the National Academy of Medicine (NAM). As a national academy, new members of the organization are elected annually by current members, based on their distinguished and continuing achievements in original research.  Election to the National Academies is one of the highest honors in the scientific field.  Members serve pro bono as "advisers to the nation" on science, engineering, and medicine. 

Vandals<====>46516<====>Vandals  The Vandals, an East Germanic tribe or group of tribes, first appear in history as inhabiting present-day southern Poland, but later moved around Europe, successively establishing kingdoms in Spain and in North Africa in the 5th century.    Scholars believe that the Vandals migrated from southern Scandinavia to the area between the lower Oder and Vistula rivers during the 2nd century BC and settled in Silesia from around 120 BC.They are associated with the Przeworsk culture and were possibly the same people as the Lugii.  Expanding into Dacia during the Marcomannic Wars and to Pannonia during the Crisis of the Third Century, the Vandals were confined to Pannonia by the Goths around 330 AD, where they received permission to settle from Constantine the Great. 

Baroque chess<====>46522<====>Baroque chess  Baroque chess is a chess variant invented in 1962 by Robert Abbott.  In 1963, at the suggestion of his publisher, he changed the name to Ultima, by which name it is also known.  Abbott considers his invention flawed, and he has suggested amendments to the rules, but these suggestions have been substantially ignored by the gaming community, which continues to play by the 1962 rules.  Since the rules for Baroque were first laid down in 1962, some regional variation has arisen, causing the game to diverge from  Ultima.   DescriptionBaroque chess is usually played on a standard 8×8 chessboard with the standard Staunton design of chess pieces. 

Napoleonic Code<====>46523<====>Napoleonic Code The Napoleonic Code ( ;  officially Code civil des Français, referred to as (le) Code civil) is the French civil code established under Napoléon I in 1804.  It was drafted by a commission of four eminent jurists and entered into force on 21 March 1804.  Robert B.  Holtman, The Napoleonic Revolution (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1981)  The Code, with its stress on clearly written and accessible law, was a major step in replacing the previous patchwork of feudal laws.  Historian Robert Holtman regards it as one of the few documents that have influenced the whole world. 

Wilfred Owen<====>46525<====>Wilfred Owen   Wilfred Edward Salter Owen, MC (18 March 1893 – 4 November 1918) was an English poet and soldier, one of the leading poets of the First World War.  His war poetry on the horrors of trenches and gas warfare was heavily influenced by his mentor Siegfried Sassoon, and stood in stark contrast both to the public perception of war at the time and to the confidently patriotic verse written by earlier war poets such as Rupert Brooke.  Among his best-known works – most of which were published posthumously – are "Dulce et Decorum est", "Insensibility", "Anthem for Doomed Youth", "Futility", "Spring Offensive" and "Strange Meeting". 

Advance-fee scam<====>46526<====>Advance-fee scam  An advance-fee scam is a form of fraud and one of the most common types of confidence trick.  The scam typically involves promising the victim a significant share of a large sum of money, in return for a small up-front payment, which the fraudster requires in order to obtain the large sum.  If a victim makes the payment, the fraudster either invents a series of further fees for the victim, or simply disappears. There are many variations on this type of scam, including the 419 scam, the Spanish Prisoner scam, the black money scam, Fifo's Fraud and the Detroit-Buffalo scam. 

Human Rights Watch<====>46530<====>Human Rights Watch   Human Rights Watch (HRW) is an international non-governmental organization that conducts research and advocacy on human rights.  HRW is headquartered in New York City with offices in Amsterdam, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Chicago, Geneva, Johannesburg, London, Los Angeles, Moscow, Nairobi, Paris, San Francisco, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto, Washington, D. C. , and Zürich. The group pressures governments, policy makers and human rights abusers to denounce abuse and respect human rights, and the group often works on behalf of refugees, children, migrants and political prisoners. Human Rights Watch in 1997 shared in the Nobel Peace Prize as a founding member of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, and it played a leading role in the 2008 treaty banning cluster munitions. 

Richard II of England<====>46531<====>Richard II of England   Richard II (6 January 1367 – c.  14 February 1400), also known as Richard of Bordeaux, was King of England from 1377 until he was deposed on 30 September 1399.  Richard, a son of Edward, the Black Prince, was born in Bordeaux during the reign of his grandfather, Edward III.   His father was Prince of Aquitaine.  Richard was the younger brother of Edward of Angoulême, upon whose death Richard, at three years of age, became second in line to the throne after his father.  Upon the death of Richard's father prior to the death of Edward III, Richard, by primogeniture, became the heir apparent to the throne. 

Non-governmental organization<====>46539<====>Non-governmental organization Non-governmental organizations, nongovernmental  organizations, or nongovernment organizations,   commonly referred to as NGOs,  are usually nonprofit and sometimes international organizations Because many of the most famous NGOs are international organizations, many people believe NGOs are by definition international, but that is not the way the term is used by NGOs, the media, governments, or international governmental organizations. (See the sources at the end of this sentence. )  independent of governments and international governmental organizations (though often funded by governments)  that are active in humanitarian, educational, healthcare, public policy, social, human rights, environmental, and other areas to effect changes according to their objectives. 

British royal family<====>46542<====>British royal familyThe British royal family comprises the monarch of the United Kingdom and her close relations.  There is no strict legal or formal definition of who is or is not a member of the British royal family and, apart from Queen Elizabeth II herself, different lists include different people.  Those who at the time are entitled to the style His or Her Royal Highness (HRH), and any styled His or Her Majesty (HM), are normally considered members, including those so styled before the beginning of the current monarch's reign.  By this criterion, a list of the current royal family will usually include the monarch, the children and male-line grandchildren of the monarch and previous monarchs, the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, and all their current or widowed spouses. 

Telecommunications network<====>46545<====>Telecommunications network  A telecommunications network is a collection of terminal nodes,  links  are connected so as to enable telecommunication between the terminals.    The transmission links connect the nodes together.  The nodes use circuit switching, message switching or packet switching to pass the signal through the correct links and nodes to reach the correct destination terminal. Each terminal in the network usually has a unique address so messages or connections can be routed to the correct recipients.  The collection of addresses in the network is called the address space. Examples of telecommunications networks are: computer networksthe Internetthe telephone networkthe global Telex networkthe aeronautical ACARS networkBenefits of telecommunications and networkingTelecommunications can greatly increase and expand resources to all types of people. 

Samuel of Bulgaria<====>46547<====>Samuel of Bulgaria  Samuel  (also Samuil, representing Bulgarian Самуил, pronounced  , Old Church Slavonic:  ) was the Tsar (Emperor) of the First Bulgarian Empire from 997 to 6 October 1014.   From 977 to 997, he was a general under Roman I of Bulgaria, the second surviving son of Emperor Peter I of Bulgaria, and co-ruled with him, as Roman bestowed upon him the command of the army and the effective royal authority.   As Samuel struggled to preserve his country's independence from the Byzantine Empire, his rule was characterized by constant warfare against the Byzantines and their equally ambitious ruler Basil II. 

Escherichia coli O157:H7<====>46553<====>Escherichia coli O157:H7DISPLAYTITLE Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a serotype of the bacterial species Escherichia coli and is one of the Shiga toxin–producing types of E.  coli.  It is a cause of disease, typically foodborne illness of the "colonic escherichiosis" type, through consumption of contaminated and raw food, including raw milk.   Infection with this type of pathogenic bacteria may lead to hemorrhagic diarrhea, and to kidney failure; these have been reported to cause the deaths of children younger than five years of age, of elderly patients, and of patients whose immune systems are otherwise compromised. 

Frumenty<====>46554<====>Frumenty Frumenty (sometimes frumentee, furmity, fromity, or fermenty) was a popular dish in Western European medieval cuisine.  It was made primarily from boiled, cracked wheat—hence its name, which derives from the Latin word frumentum, "grain".  Different recipes added milk, eggs or broth.  Other recipes include almonds, currants, sugar, saffron and orange flower water.  Frumenty was served with meat as a pottage, traditionally with venison or occasionally porpoise (considered a "fish" and therefore appropriate for Lent ).  It was also frequently used as a subtlety. For several centuries, frumenty was part of the traditional Celtic Christmas meal. 

L-system<====>46565<====>L-system An L-system or Lindenmayer system is a parallel rewriting system and a type of formal grammar.  An L-system consists of an alphabet of symbols that can be used to make strings, a collection of production rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial "axiom" string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures.  L-systems were introduced and developed in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer, a Hungarian theoretical biologist and botanist at the University of Utrecht.  Lindenmayer used L-systems to describe the behaviour of plant cells and to model the growth processes of plant development. 

Bread pudding<====>46568<====>Bread pudding  Bread pudding is a bread-based dessert popular in many countries' cuisines.  In other languages, its name is a translation of "bread pudding" or even just "pudding", for example "pudín" or "budín".   In the Philippines, banana bread pudding is popular.  In Mexico, there is a similar dish eaten during Lent called capirotada.   Bread pudding is made with stale bread and milk or cream, generally containing eggs, a form of fat such as oil, butter or suet, and depending on whether the pudding is sweet or savory, a variety of other ingredients.  Sweet bread puddings may use sugar, syrup, honey, dried fruit, nuts, as well as spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, or vanilla. 

Batavia (region)<====>46571<====>Batavia (region)   Batavia was the name used by the Roman Empire for the land of the Batavians, a Germanic tribe.  It was described as a large island between rivers in the Rhine-Meuse delta.  Its modern equivalent is Betuwe.   The Batavians shared the island with the Canninefates, to their west near the coast.  Their Roman city was Nijmegen. The "Batavian island" in the Rhine river was mentioned by Julius Caesar in his commentary Commentarii de Bello Gallico.  The island's easternmost point is at a split in the Rhine, one arm being the Waal and the other the Lower Rhine/Old Rhine (hence the Latin name Insula Batavorum, "Island of the Batavi"). 

Oat<====>46573<====>Oat   The oat (Avena sativa), sometimes called the common oat, is a species of cereal grain grown for its seed, which is known by the same name (usually in the plural, unlike other cereals and pseudocereals).  While oats are suitable for human consumption as oatmeal and rolled oats, one of the most common uses is as livestock feed.  Oats are a nutrient-rich food associated with lower blood cholesterol when consumed regularly.  Avenins present in oats (proteins similar to gliadin from wheat) can trigger celiac disease in a small proportion of people.  Also, oat products are frequently contaminated by other gluten-containing grains, mainly wheat and barley. 

Rye<====>46574<====>Rye    Rye (Secale cereale) is a grass grown extensively as a grain, a cover crop and a forage crop.  It is a member of the wheat tribe (Triticeae) and is closely related to barley (genus Hordeum) and wheat (Triticum).   Rye grain is used for flour, rye bread, rye beer, crisp bread, some whiskeys, some vodkas, and animal fodder.  It can also be eaten whole, either as boiled rye berries or by being rolled, similar to rolled oats. Rye is a cereal grain and should not be confused with ryegrass, which is used for lawns, pasture, and hay for livestock. 

Tare<====>46575<====>Tare Tare or Tares may refer to:Tare (armour), a leg and groin protector used in a number of Japanese martial artsTare (surname), a surnameTare (tufted grass), a genus of nine species of tufted grassesTare, RwandaTare River, in RomaniaTare sauce, a Japanese dipping sauceTare weight, the weight of an empty vehicle or containerTares, IranVicia sativa a plant also known as the tareParable of the Tares, a parable of Jesus 

Turnip<====>46576<====>Turnip   The turnip or white turnip (Brassica rapa subsp.  rapa) is a root vegetable commonly grown in temperate climates worldwide for its white, bulbous taproot.  The word turnip is a compound of tur- as in turned/rounded on a lathe and neep, derived from Latin napus.  Small, tender varieties are grown for human consumption, while larger varieties are grown as feed for livestock.  In the north of England, Scotland, and eastern Canada (Newfoundland), turnip (or neep) often refers to rutabaga, a larger, yellow root vegetable in the same genus (Brassica) also known as swede (from "Swedish turnip"). 

Hedgehog<====>46590<====>HedgehogA  hedgehog  is any of the spiny mammals of the subfamily Erinaceinae, in the eulipotyphlan family Erinaceidae.  There are seventeen species of hedgehog in five genera, found through parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in New Zealand by introduction.  There are no hedgehogs native to Australia, and no living species native to the Americas (the extinct genus Amphechinus was once present in North America).  Hedgehogs share distant ancestry with shrews (family Soricidae), with gymnures possibly being the intermediate link, and have changed little over the last 15 million years. 

Henry III of England<====>46591<====>Henry III of England    Henry III (1 October 1207 – 16 November 1272), also known as Henry of Winchester, was King of England, Lord of Ireland, and Duke of Aquitaine from 1216 until his death.   The son of King John and Isabella of Angoulême, Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the First Barons' War.  Cardinal Guala declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by William Marshal, defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217.  Henry promised to abide by the Great Charter of 1225, which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons. 

Humulus<====>46592<====>Humulus Humulus, hop, is a small genus of flowering plants in the family Cannabaceae.  The hop is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.  Hops are the female flowers (seed cones, strobiles) of the hop species H.  lupulus; as a main flavor ingredient in beer, H.  lupulus is widely cultivated for use by the brewing industry. Description Although frequently referred to as the hops "vine", it is technically a bine; unlike vines, which use tendrils, suckers, and other appendages for attaching themselves, bines have stout stems with stiff hairs to aid in climbing.  It is a perennial herbaceous plant which sends up new shoots in early spring and dies back to the cold-hardy rhizome in autumn. 

Hay<====>46593<====>Hay    Hay is grass, legumes, or other herbaceous plants that have been cut, dried, and stored for use as animal fodder, particularly for grazing animals such as cattle, horses, goats, and sheep.  Hay is also fed to smaller animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs.  Pigs may be fed hay, but they do not digest it as efficiently as fully herbivorous animals. Hay can be used as animal fodder when or where there is not enough pasture or rangeland on which to graze an animal, when grazing is unavailable due to weather (such as during the winter) or when lush pasture by itself is too rich for the health of the animal. 

Straw<====>46594<====>Straw   Straw is an agricultural by-product, the dry  s of cereal plants, after the grain and chaff have been removed.   Straw makes up about half of the yield of cereal crops such as barley, oats, rice, rye and wheat.   It has many uses, including fuel, livestock bedding and fodder, thatching and basket-making.   It is usually gathered and stored in a straw bale, which is a bundle of straw tightly bound with twine or wire.  Bales may be square, rectangular, or round, depending on the type of baler used. UsesCurrent and historic uses of straw include:Animal feedStraw may be fed as part of the roughage component of the diet to cattle or horses that are on a near maintenance level of energy requirement. 

Loom<====>46595<====>Loom  A Loom is a device used to weave cloth and tapestry.  The basic purpose of any loom is to hold the warp threads under tension to facilitate the interweaving of the weft threads.  The precise shape of the loom and its mechanics may vary, but the basic function is the same. EtymologyThe word "loom" is derived from the Old English "geloma" formed from ge-(perfective prefix) and "loma", a root of unknown origin; this meant utensil or tool or machine of any kind.   In 1404 it was used to mean a machine to enable weaving thread into cloth. 

Drainage<====>46596<====>Drainage   Drainage is the natural or artificial removal of a surface's water and sub-surface water from an area.  The internal drainage of most agricultural soils is good enough to prevent severe waterlogging (anaerobic conditions that harm root growth), but many soils need artificial drainage to improve production or to manage water supplies. HistoryEarly historyThe ancient Indus of sewerage and drainage that were developed and used in cities throughout the civilization were far more advanced than any found in contemporary urban cities in the Middle East and even more efficient than those in some areas of the Indian Subcontinent today. 

Earth observation satellite<====>46597<====>Earth observation satelliteEarth observation satellites are satellites specifically designed for Earth observation from orbit, similar to spy satellites but intended for non-military uses such as environmental monitoring, meteorology, map making etc. Most Earth observation satellites carry instruments that should be operated at a relatively low altitude.  Altitudes below 500-600 kilometers are in general avoided, though, because of the significant air-drag at such low altitudes making frequent orbit reboost maneuvres necessary.   The Earth observation satellites ERS-1, ERS-2 and Envisat of European Space Agency as well as the MetOp spacecraft of EUMETSAT are all operated at altitudes of about 800 km. 

Leiden<====>46599<====>Leiden   {{Infobox settlement  }}Leiden ( ;  ; in English and archaic Dutch also Leyden) is a city and municipality in the Dutch province of South Holland.  The municipality of Leiden has a population of 122,915, but the city forms one densely connected agglomeration with its suburbs Oegstgeest, Leiderdorp, Voorschoten and Zoeterwoude with 206,647 inhabitants.  The Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) further includes Katwijk in the agglomeration which makes the total population of the Leiden urban agglomeration 270,879, and in the larger Leiden urban area also Teylingen, Noordwijk, and Noordwijkerhout are included with in total 348,868 inhabitants. 

Cambyses II<====>46601<====>Cambyses II   Cambyses II (  KambūjiyaKanbūzī;    Kambúsēs; Latin Cambyses; Medieval Hebrew  , Kambisha ) (d.  522 BC) son of Cyrus the Great (r.  559–530 BC), was emperor of the Achaemenid Empire. Cambyses' grandfather was Cambyses I, king of Anshan.  Following Cyrus the Great's conquest of the Near East and Central Asia, Cambyses II further expanded the empire into Egypt during the Late Period by defeating the Egyptian Pharaoh Psamtik III during the battle of Pelusium in 525 BC.  After the Egyptian campaign and the truce with Libya, Cambyses invaded the Kingdom of Kush (located in what is now the Sudan) but with little success. 

Demosthenes<====>46605<====>Demosthenes  Demosthenes ( ;   Dēmosthénēs;  ; 384 – 12 October 322 BC) was a Greek statesman and orator of ancient Athens.  His orations constitute a significant expression of contemporary Athenian intellectual prowess and provide an insight into the politics and culture of ancient Greece during the 4th century BC.  Demosthenes learned rhetoric by studying the speeches of previous great orators.  He delivered his first judicial speeches at the age of 20, in which he argued effectively to gain from his guardians what was left of his inheritance.  For a time, Demosthenes made his living as a professional speech-writer (logographer) and a lawyer, writing speeches for use in private legal suits. 

Catiline<====>46607<====>Catiline  Lucius Sergius Catilina, known in English as Catiline ( ; 108–62 BC), was a Roman Senator of the 1st century BC best known for the second Catilinarian conspiracy, an attempt to overthrow the Roman Republic and, in particular, the power of the aristocratic Senate.He is also known for several acquittals in court, including one for the charge of adultery with a Vestal Virgin. LifeFamily backgroundCatiline was born in 108 BC to one of the oldest patrician families in Rome, gens Sergia.  Although his family was of consular heritage, they were then declining in both social and financial fortunes. 

Shovelware<====>46618<====>ShovelwareShovelware is derogatory computer jargon for software bundles noted more for the quantity of what is included than for the quality or usefulness.The metaphor implies that the creators showed little care for the quality of the original software, as if the new compilation or version had been created by indiscriminately adding titles "by the shovel" in the same way someone would shovel bulk material into a pile.  The term "shovelware" is coined by semantic analogy to phrases like shareware and freeware, which describe methods of software distribution.   It first appeared in the early 1990s when large amounts of public domain, open source and shareware demos and programs were copied onto CD-ROMs and advertised in magazines or sold at computer flea markets.

Soundtrack<====>46621<====>Soundtrack   A soundtrack, also written sound track,  can be recorded music accompanying and synchronized to the images of a motion picture, book, television program or video game; a commercially released soundtrack album of music as featured in the soundtrack of a film, video or television presentation; or the physical area of a film that contains the synchronized recorded sound. Origin of the termIn movie industry terminology usage, a sound track is an audio recording created or used in film production or post-production.  Initially the dialogue, sound effects, and music in a film each has its own separate track (dialogue track, sound effects track, and music track), and these are mixed together to make what is called the composite track, which is heard in the film. 

Mise-en-scène<====>46622<====>Mise-en-scène Mise-en-scène (  "placing on stage") is an expression used to describe the design aspect of a theatre or film production, which essentially means "visual theme" or "telling a story"—both in visually artful ways through storyboarding, cinematography and stage design, and in poetically artful ways through direction.  It is also commonly used to refer to multiple single scenes within the film to represent the film.  Mise-en-scène has been called film criticism's "grand undefined term".  Definition in film studiesWhen applied to the cinema, mise-en-scène refers to everything that appears before the camera and its arrangement—composition, sets, props, actors, costumes, and lighting. 

Automated teller machine<====>46628<====>Automated teller machine   An automated teller machine (ATM) is an electronic telecommunications device that enables customers of financial institutions to perform financial transactions, such as cash withdrawals, deposits, transfer funds, or obtaining account information, at any time and without the need for direct interaction with bank staff.  ATMs are known by a variety of names, including automatic teller machine in the United States    (ATM, American, British, Australian, Malaysian, South African, Singaporean, Indian, Maldivian, Hiberno, Philippines and Sri Lankan English), often redundantly ATM machine, automated banking machine (ABM, Canadian English ), cash point (British English ), cashline, minibank, cash machine, tyme machine, cash dispenser, bankomat or bancomat. 

Embedded system<====>46630<====>Embedded system An embedded system is a computer system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts.  Embedded systems control many devices in common use today.   Ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors are manufactured as components of embedded systems.  Examples of properties of typical embedded computers when compared with general-purpose counterparts are low power consumption, small size, rugged operating ranges, and low per-unit cost.  This comes at the price of limited processing resources, which make them significantly more difficult to program and to interact with. 

Turing tarpit<====>46633<====>Turing tarpitA Turing tarpit (or Turing tar-pit) is any programming language or computer interface that allows for flexibility in function but is difficult to learn and use because it offers little or no support for common tasks.   The phrase was coined in 1982 by Alan Perlis in the Epigrams on Programming:  In any Turing complete language, it is possible to write any computer program, so in a very rigorous sense nearly all programming languages are equally capable.  Showing that theoretical ability is not the same as usefulness in practice, Turing tarpits are characterized by having a simple abstract machine that requires the user to deal with many details in the solution of a problem. 

Xenu<====>46634<====>XenuXenu ( ),   also called Xemu, was, according to Scientology founder L.  Ron Hubbard, the dictator of the "Galactic Confederacy" who 75 million years ago brought billions As 10 9 , or thousands of millions in Long Scaleof his people to Earth (then known as "Teegeeack") in DC-8-like spacecraft, stacked them around volcanoes, and killed them with hydrogen bombs.  Official Scientology scriptures hold that the thetans (immortal spirits) of these aliens adhere to humans, causing spiritual harm.  These events are known within Scientology as "Incident II",    and the traumatic memories associated with them as "The Wall of Fire" or "R6 implant". 

Maoism<====>46636<====>Maoism    Mao Zedong Thought ( ), or Maoism, is a political theory derived from the teachings of the Chinese political leader Mao Zedong (1893–1976), whose followers are known as Maoists.  Developed from the 1950s until the Deng Xiaoping reforms in the 1970s, it was widely applied as the guiding political and military ideology of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and as theory guiding revolutionary movements around the world.  The essential difference between Maoism and other forms of Marxism is that Mao said that peasants should be the bulwark of the revolutionary energy, led by the working class in China. 

Dow Jones & Company<====>46638<====>Dow Jones & Company    Dow Jones & Company is an American publishing and financial information firm that has been owned by News Corp.  since 2007. The company was best known for the publication of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and related market statistics, Dow Jones Newswire and a number of financial publications.   In 2010 the Dow Jones Indexes subsidiary was sold to the CME Group and the company focused on financial news publications, including its flagship publication The Wall Street Journal and providing financial news and information tools to financial companies. The company was led by the Bancroft family, which held 64% of voting stock, from the 1920s until 2007 when an extended takeover battle saw News Corp take control of the company. 

World Council of Churches<====>46639<====>World Council of Churches The World Council of Churches (WCC) is a worldwide inter-church organization founded in 1948.  Its members today include the Assyrian Church of the East, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, most jurisdictions of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Old Catholic Church, Anglican Communion, most mainline Protestant churches (such as the Lutheran, Mennonite, Methodist, Moravian and Reformed) and some evangelical Protestant churches (such as the Baptist and Pentecostal).   Notably, the Roman Catholic Church is not a member, although it sends accredited observers to meetings.   The WCC arose out of the ecumenical movement and has as its basis the following statement: The WCC describes itself as "a worldwide fellowship of 349 global, regional and sub-regional, national and local churches seeking unity, a common witness and Christian service. 

Nicholas I of Russia<====>46641<====>Nicholas I of Russia For the ship, see: Imperator Nikolai I. Nicholas I ( ;   –  ) was the Emperor of Russia from 1825 until 1855.  He was also the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Finland.  He is best known as a political conservative whose reign was marked by geographical expansion, repression of dissent, economic stagnation, poor administrative policies, a corrupt bureaucracy, and frequent wars that culminated in Russia's defeat in the Crimean War of 1853–56.  His biographer Nicholas V.  Riasanovsky says that Nicholas displayed determination, singleness of purpose, and an iron will, along with a powerful sense of duty and a dedication to very hard work. 

Grep<====>46642<====>Grep   grep  is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular expression.  Its name comes from the ed command g/re/p (globally search a regular expression and print), which has the same effect: doing a global search with the regular expression and printing all matching lines. Grep was originally developed for the Unix operating system, but later available for all Unix-like systems. HistoryFirst appearing in Version 4 Unix, grep was created by Ken Thompson as a standalone application adapted from the regular expression parser he had written for ed (which he also created). 

Enrico Berlinguer<====>46652<====>Enrico Berlinguer  Enrico Berlinguer (   ; 15 May 1922 – 11 June 1984) was an Italian politician. Considered the most popular leader of the Italian Communist Party (Partito Comunista Italiano or PCI),    which he led as the national secretary from 1972 until his death during a tense period in Italy's history, marked by the Years of Lead and social conflicts such as the Hot Autumn of 1969–1970.   He distanced the party from the influence of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and pursued a moderate line, repositioning the party within Italian politics and advocating accommodation and national unity. 

Four Cardinal Principles<====>46654<====>Four Cardinal PrinciplesThe Four Cardinal Principles ( ) were stated by Deng Xiaoping in 1979 and are the four issues for which debate was not allowed within the People's Republic of China.    These are:the principle of upholding the socialist paththe principle of upholding the people's democratic dictatorshipthe principle of upholding the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and the principle of upholding Mao Zedong Thought and Marxism-LeninismThe four cardinal principles marked a relaxation of control over ideology.   In stating the four cardinal principles, the implication was that these four topics could not be questioned, but political ideas other than those in the list could be debated. 

Radio telescope<====>46656<====>Radio telescopeA radio telescope is a specialized antenna and radio receiver used to receive radio waves from astronomical radio sources in the sky in radio astronomy. Radio telescopes are the main observing instrument used in radio astronomy, which studies the radio frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum emitted by astronomical objects, just as optical telescopes are the main observing instrument used in traditional optical astronomy which studies the light wave portion of the spectrum coming from astronomical objects.  Radio telescopes are typically large parabolic ("dish") antennas  similar to those employed in tracking and communicating with satellites and space probes.

History of Wales<====>46672<====>History of Wales    The history of Wales  begins with the arrival of human beings in the region thousands of years ago.  Neanderthals lived in what is now Wales, or Cymru in Welsh, at least 230,000 years ago,  while Homo sapiens arrived by about 31,000 BC.However, continuous habitation by modern humans dates from the period after the end of the last ice age around 9000 BC, and Wales has many remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age.  During the Iron Age the region, like all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth, was dominated by the Celtic Britons and the Brittonic language. 

Battle of Tours<====>46674<====>Battle of Tours    The Battle of Tours (10 October 732)   – also called the Battle of Poitiers and, by Arab sources, the Battle of the Palace of the Martyrs ( )– was fought by Frankish and Burgundian   forces under Charles Martel against an army of the Umayyad Caliphate led by 'Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi, Governor-General of al-Andalus.  It was fought in an area between the cities of Poitiers and Tours, in the Aquitaine of west-central France, near the village of Moussais-la-Bataille, about   northeast of Poitiers. 

Xylem<====>46675<====>Xylem Xylem is one of the two types of transport tissue in vascular plants, phloem being the other.  The basic function of xylem is to transport water from roots to shoots and leaves, but it also transports some nutrients.    The word "xylem" is derived from the Greek word ξύλον (xylon), meaning "wood"; the best-known xylem tissue is wood, though it is found throughout the plant.   The term was introduced by Nägeli in 1858.   Structure The most distinctive xylem cells are the long tracheary elements that transport water.  Tracheids and vessel elements are distinguished by their shape;  vessel elements are shorter, and are connected together into long tubes that are called vessels. 

Banach fixed-point theorem<====>46676<====>Banach fixed-point theoremIn mathematics, the Banach fixed-point theorem (also known as the contraction mapping theorem or contraction mapping principle) is an important tool in the theory of metric spaces; it guarantees the existence and uniqueness of fixed points of certain self-maps of metric spaces, and provides a constructive method to find those fixed points.   The theorem is named after Stefan Banach (1892–1945), and was first stated by him in 1922.  StatementDefinition.  Let (X, d) be a metric space.  Then a map T : X → X is called a contraction mapping on X if there exists q ∈ [0, 1) such that d(T(x),T(y)) \le q d(x,y) for all x, y in X. 

Die Fledermaus<====>46677<====>Die Fledermaus    ( , The Bat, sometimes called The Revenge of the Bat) is an operetta composed by Johann Strauss II to a German libretto by   and Richard Genée. BackgroundThe original literary source for   was   (The Prison), a farce by German playwright Julius Roderich Benedix  that premiered in Berlin in 1851.  On 10 September 1872 a three-act French vaudeville play  by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy,  , loosely based on the Benedix farce, opened at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal.   Meilhac and Halévy had provided several successful libretti for Offenbach and Le Réveillon later formed the basis for the 1926 silent film So This Is Paris, directed by Ernst Lubitsch. 

Entropy encoding<====>46680<====>Entropy encoding In information theory an  entropy encoding is a lossless data compression scheme that is independent of the specific characteristics of the medium. One of the main types of entropy coding creates and assigns a unique prefix-free code to each unique symbol that occurs in the input.   These entropy encoders then compress data by replacing each fixed-length input symbol with the corresponding variable-length prefix-free output codeword.  The length of each codeword is approximately proportional to the negative logarithm of the probability.   Therefore, the most common symbols use the shortest codes. According to Shannon's source coding theorem, the optimal code length for a symbol is −log b P, where b is the number of symbols used to make output codes and P is the probability of the input symbol. 

Amalfi<====>46683<====>Amalfi   Amalfi is a town and comune in the province of Salerno, in the region of Campania, Italy, on the Gulf of Salerno.  It lies at the mouth of a deep ravine, at the foot of Monte Cerreto (1,315 metres, 4,314 feet), surrounded by dramatic cliffs and coastal scenery.  The town of Amalfi was the capital of the maritime republic known as the Duchy of Amalfi, an important trading power in the Mediterranean between 839 and around 1200. In the 1920s and 1930s, Amalfi was a popular holiday destination for the British upper class and aristocracy.

She continued to reign as Queen of Great Britain and Ireland until her death. Anne was born in the reign of her uncle Charles II, who had no legitimate children.  Her father, James, was thus heir presumptive to the throne.  His suspected Roman Catholicism was unpopular in England, and on Charles's instructions Anne and her elder sister, Mary, were raised as Anglicans.

Charles II's father, Charles I, was executed at Whitehall on 30 January 1649, at the climax of the English Civil War.  Although the Parliament of Scotland proclaimed Charles II king on 5 February 1649, England entered the period known as the English Interregnum or the English Commonwealth, and the country was a de facto republic, led by Oliver Cromwell. 

Saracen<====>46689<====>Saracen Saracen was a term widely used among Christian writers in Europe during the Middle Ages.  The term's meaning evolved during its history.  In the early centuries of the Common Era, Greek and Latin writings used this term to refer to the people who lived in desert areas in and near the Roman province of Arabia Petraea, and who were specifically distinguished from others as a people known as Arabs.  Daniel, p.  53.   Retso, pp.  505-506.   In Europe during the Early Middle Ages, the term came to be associated with tribes of Arabia as well. 

Sherman Antitrust Act<====>46693<====>Sherman Antitrust Act   The Sherman Antitrust Act (Sherman Act,   ,  ) is a landmark federal statute in the history of United States antitrust law (or "competition law") passed by Congress in 1890 under the presidency of Benjamin Harrison.  It allowed certain business activities that federal government regulators deem to be competitive, and recommended the federal government to investigate and pursue trusts. In the general sense, a trust is a centuries-old legal arrangement whereby one party conveys property to a trustee to hold for a beneficiary.  These are commonly used to hold inheritances for the benefit of children, for example. 

Machaeridian<====>46696<====>Machaeridian Machaeridia is an extinct group of armoured, segmented annelid worms, known from the Early Ordovician (Late Tremadoc) to Carboniferous.  The group consist of three distinct families: the plumulitids, turrilepadids and lepidocoleids.    FossilsOnly the calcitic sclerites ("armour plates") of these worms tend to be preserved in the fossil record.   These are tiny, and usually found disarticulated:  articulated specimens reach about a centimeter in length, and are incredibly rare – hence the limited degree of study since their description in 1857.    The machaeridians are characterized by having serialized rows of calcitic shell plates. 

Property damage<====>46698<====>Property damage  Property damage (or, in England and Wales, criminal damage) is damage to or the destruction of public or private property, caused either by a person who is not its owner or by natural phenomena.  Property damage caused by persons is generally categorized by its cause: neglect (including oversight and human error), and intentional damage.  Intentional property damage is often, but not always, malicious.  Property damage caused by natural phenomena may be legally attributed to a person if that person's neglect allowed for the damage to occur. IntentionIntentional property damage may be considered a form of violence, albeit one usually (but not always) less reprehensible than violence which does bodily harm to other living beings. 

Electoral fusion<====>46699<====>Electoral fusion  Electoral fusion is an arrangement where two or more political parties on a ballot list the same candidate, pooling the votes for that candidate.  Distinct from the process of electoral alliances in that the political parties remain separately listed on the ballot, the practice of electoral fusion in jurisdictions where it exists allows minor parties to influence election results and policy by offering to endorse or nominate a major party's candidate. Electoral fusion is also known as fusion voting, cross endorsement, multiple party nomination, multi-party nomination, plural nomination, and ballot freedom.  Brazil Electoral fusion is very common in Brazil. 

Bodily harm<====>46701<====>Bodily harm Bodily harm is a legal term of art used in the definition of both statutory and common law offences in Australia, Canada, England and Wales and other common law jurisdictions.  It is a synonym for injury or bodily injury and similar expressions, though it may be used with a precise and limited meaning in any given jurisdiction.  The expression grievous bodily harm first appeared in a statute in Lord Ellenborough's Act (1803). CanadaIn the Canadian Criminal Code, "bodily harm" is defined as "any hurt or injury to a person that interferes with the health or comfort of the person and that is more than merely transient or trifling in nature.

Fort Ticonderoga<====>46710<====>Fort Ticonderoga  Fort Ticonderoga, formerly Fort Carillon, is a large 18th-century star fort built by the French at a narrows near the south end of Lake Champlain, in northern New York, in the United States.  It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the "North American theater" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War.  The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. 

William Tecumseh Sherman<====>46720<====>William Tecumseh Sherman   William Tecumseh Sherman (February 8, 1820 – February 14, 1891) was an American soldier, businessman, educator, and author.  He served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War (1861–65), for which he received recognition for his outstanding command of military strategy as well as criticism for the harshness of the "scorched earth" policies he implemented in conducting total war against the Confederate States.  Sherman began his Civil War career serving in the First Battle of Bull Run and Kentucky in 1861.  He served under General Ulysses S.  Grant in 1862 and 1863 during the battles of forts Henry and Donelson, the Battle of Shiloh, the campaigns that led to the fall of the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg on the Mississippi River, and the Chattanooga Campaign, which culminated with the routing of the Confederate armies in the state of Tennessee.

Arion<====>46725<====>Arion Arion ( ;  ) was a kitharode in ancient Greece, a Dionysiac poet credited with inventing the dithyramb: "As a literary composition for chorus dithyramb was the creation of Arion of Corinth,"  The islanders of Lesbos claimed him as their native son, but Arion found a patron in Periander, tyrant of Corinth.  Although notable for his musical inventions, Arion is chiefly remembered for the fantastic myth of his kidnapping by pirates and miraculous rescue by dolphins, a folktale motif.  Herodotus (1,23) says "Arion was second to none of the lyre-players in his time and was also the first man we know of to compose and name the dithyramb and teach it in Corinth".

Post-Classical Jewish traditions stressed his status as the representative of paganism, in contrast to David, the champion of the God of Israel.  Christian tradition sees David's battle with Goliath the victory of God's king over the enemies of God's helpless people as a prefiguring of Jesus' victory over sin on the cross and the Church's victory over Satan. 

Euler's identity<====>46740<====>Euler's identity  In mathematics, Euler's identity (also known as Euler's equation) is the equality e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0 where  is Euler's number, the base of natural logarithms,  is the imaginary unit, which satisfies  , and  is pi, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.   Euler's identity is named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler.  It is considered to be an example of mathematical beauty, perhaps a supreme example as it shows a profound connection between the most fundamental numbers in mathematics. ExplanationEuler's identity is a special case of Euler's formula from complex analysis, which states that for any real number  , e^{ix} = \cos x +  i\sin x where the inputs of the trigonometric functions sine and cosine are given in radians.

She was Queen of the United Kingdom and the Dominions from her husband's accession in 1936 until his death in 1952, after which she was known as Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother,  to avoid confusion with her daughter.  She was the last Empress of India. Born into a family of British nobility, she came to prominence in 1923 when she married the Duke of York, the second son of King George V and Queen Mary. 

The Mikado<====>46747<====>The Mikado    The Mikado; or, The Town of Titipu is a comic opera in two acts, with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W.  S.  Gilbert, their ninth of fourteen operatic collaborations.  It opened on 14 March 1885, in London, where it ran at the Savoy Theatre for 672 performances, which was the second longest run for any work of musical theatre and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece up to that time.   The longest-running piece of musical theatre was the operetta Les Cloches de Corneville, which held the title until Dorothy opening in 1886, which pushed The Mikado down to third place. 

Virginia opossum<====>46750<====>Virginia opossum The Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), commonly known as the North American opossum, is a marsupial found in North America.  It is the only marsupial found north of Mexico.  In the United States, it is typically referred to simply as a possum.   It is a solitary and nocturnal animal about the size of a domestic cat.  It is a successful opportunist.  It is familiar to many North Americans as it is often seen near towns, rummaging through garbage cans. NameThe Virginia opossum is the original animal named "opossum".  The word comes from Algonquian wapathemwa meaning "white animal". 

Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest Hits<====>46752<====>Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest Hits  Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest Hits is the first compilation album from Simon & Garfunkel, released on June 14, 1972, two years after the duo had split. The album is currently available on CD under Legacy's Playlist banner. Overview The album was a mix of original studio recordings and four previously unreleased live recordings.  The album's minimalist packaging does not specifically date the latter; however, the live versions of "For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her" and "Kathy's Song" included on Greatest Hits were also included on the 2008 album Live 1969.  The liner notes to Live 1969 state that these two songs were both recorded at a November 1969 concert in St. 

Sacred geometry<====>46754<====>Sacred geometry Sacred geometry ascribes symbolic and sacred meanings to certain geometric shapes and certain geometric proportions.   It is associated with the belief that a god is the geometer of the world.  The geometry used in the design and construction of religious structures such as churches, temples, mosques, religious monuments, altars, and tabernacles has sometimes been considered sacred.  The concept applies also to sacred spaces such as temenoi, sacred groves, village greens and holy wells, and the creation of religious art. As worldview and cosmology The belief that a god created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. 

George VI<====>46755<====>George VI   George VI (Albert Frederick Arthur George; 14 December 1895 – 6 February 1952) was King of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Commonwealth from 11 December 1936 until his death.  He was the last Emperor of India and the first Head of the Commonwealth. Known publicly as Albert until his accession and "Bertie" among his family and close friends, George VI was born in the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria and was named after his great-grandfather Albert, Prince Consort.  As the second son of King George V, he was not expected to inherit the throne and spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother, Edward.

Edward Thomas (poet)<====>46758<====>Edward Thomas (poet)   Philip Edward Thomas (3 March 1878 – 9 April 1917) was a British poet, essayist, and novelist.  He is commonly considered a war poet, although few of his poems deal directly with his war experiences, and his career in poetry only came after he had already been a successful writer and literary critic.  In 1915, he enlisted in the British Army to fight in the First World War and was killed in action during the Battle of Arras in 1917, soon after he arrived in France. A Study Centre, dedicated to Edward Thomas, featuring over 1800 books by and about Edward Thomas collected by the late Tim Wilton-Steer, has been opened in Petersfield Museum. 

Terra Australis<====>46760<====>Terra Australis Terra Australis (Latin for South Land) is a hypothetical continent first posited in antiquity and which appeared on maps between the 15th and 18th centuries.  The existence of Terra Australis was not based on any survey or direct observation, but rather on the idea that continental land in the Northern Hemisphere should be balanced by land in the south.  John Noble Wilford: The Mapmakers, the Story of the Great Pioneers in Cartography from Antiquity to Space Age, p.  139, Vintage Books, Random House 1982,    This theory of balancing land has been documented as early as the 5th century on maps by Macrobius, who uses the term Australis on his maps. 

County Antrim<====>46761<====>County Antrim    County Antrim (named after the town of Antrim,  ,  ) ) is one of six counties that form Northern Ireland.  Adjoined to the north-east shore of Lough Neagh, the county covers an area of    and has a population of about 618,000.  County Antrim has a population density of 203 people per square kilometre or 526 people per square mile.   It is also one of the thirty-two traditional counties of Ireland, as well as part of the historic province of Ulster. The Glens of Antrim offer isolated rugged landscapes, the Giant's Causeway is a unique landscape and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Bushmills produces whiskey, and Portrush is a popular seaside resort and night-life area. 

Alfred Marshall<====>46762<====>Alfred MarshallAlfred Marshall (26 July 1842 – 13 July 1924) was one of the most influential economists of his time.  His book, Principles of Economics (1890), was the dominant economic textbook in England for many years.  It brings the ideas of supply and demand, marginal utility, and costs of production into a coherent whole.  He is known as one of the founders of neoclassical economics.   Although Marshall took economics to a more mathematically rigorous level, he did not want mathematics to overshadow economics and thus make economics irrelevant to the layman. 

Crimean War<====>46763<====>Crimean War The Crimean War ( ;or("Eastern War");  ;  ;  ) was a military conflict fought from October 1853 to February 1856  in which the Russian Empire lost to an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, France, Britain and Sardinia.  The immediate cause involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land, which was a part of the Ottoman Empire.  The French promoted the rights of Roman Catholics, while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Church.  The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at Ottoman expense. 

Even-toed ungulate<====>46764<====>Even-toed ungulate  The even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla,  ) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes.  By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toes.  The aquatic cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from within even-toed ungulates, so modern taxonomic classification sometimes combines the Artiodactyla and Cetacea into the Cetartiodactyla. Excluding whales, the roughly 220 artiodactyl species include pigs, peccaries, hippopotamuses, cetaceans, camels, llamas, alpacas, mouse deer, deer, giraffes, antelopes, sheep, goats, and cattle, many of which are of great dietary, economic, and cultural importance to humans. 

François Quesnay<====>46765<====>François Quesnay  François Quesnay ( ; 4 June 1694 – 16 December 1774) was a French economist and physician of the Physiocratic school.   He is known for publishing the "Tableau économique" (Economic Table) in 1758, which provided the foundations of the ideas of the Physiocrats.   This was perhaps the first work attempting to describe the workings of the economy in an analytical way, and as such can be viewed as one of the first important contributions to economic thought.  His Le Despotisme de la Chine, written in 1767, describes Chinese politics and society, and his own political support for constitutional Oriental despotism. 

Léon Walras<====>46769<====>Léon Walras Marie-Esprit-Léon Walras ( ;  16 December 1834 – 5 January 1910) was a French mathematical economist and Georgist.   He formulated the marginal theory of value (independently of William Stanley Jevons and Carl Menger) and pioneered the development of general equilibrium theory. BiographyWalras was the son of a French school administrator Auguste Walras.  His father was not a professional economist, yet his economic thinking had a profound effect on his son.  He found the value of goods by setting their scarcity relative to human wants. Walras enrolled in the École des Mines de Paris, but grew tired of engineering. 

Fixed-wing aircraft<====>46770<====>Fixed-wing aircraft A fixed-wing aircraft is an aircraft, such as an airplane or aeroplane (See Spelling Differences), which is capable of flight using wings that generate lift caused by the vehicle's forward airspeed and the shape of the wings.  Fixed-wing aircraft are distinct from rotary-wing aircraft, in which the wings form a rotor mounted on a spinning shaft, and ornithopters, in which the wings flap in similar manner to a bird. Glider fixed-wing aircraft, including free-flying gliders of various kinds and tethered kites, can use moving air to gain height. Powered fixed-wing aircraft that gain forward thrust from an engine (aeroplanes) include powered paragliders, powered hang gliders and some ground effect vehicles. 

Lake Van<====>46772<====>Lake Van  Lake Van ( ,  , Vana lič̣,  ), the largest lake in Turkey, lies in the far east of that country in the provinces of Van and Bitlis.  It is a saline soda lake, receiving water from numerous small streams that descend from the surrounding mountains.  Lake Van is one of the world's largest endorheic lakes (having no outlet) –  a  volcanic eruption blocked the original outlet from the basin in ancient times.  Although Lake Van has an altitude of   in a region with harsh winters, its high salinity prevents most of it from freezing, and even the shallow northern section freezes only rarely. 

Fanorona<====>46776<====>Fanorona Fanorona ( ) is a strategy board game for two players.  The game is indigenous to Madagascar.IntroductionFanorona has three standard versions: Fanoron-Telo, Fanoron-Dimy, and Fanoron-Tsivy.  The difference between these variants is the size of board played on.  Fanoron-Telo is played on a 3×3 board and the difficulty of this game can be compared to the game of tic-tac-toe.  Fanoron-Dimy is played on a 5×5 board and Fanoron-Tsivy is played on a 9×5 board—Tsivy being the most popular.  Black and white pieces, twenty-two each, are arranged on all points but the center. 

Human-powered transport<====>46779<====>Human-powered transport Human-powered transport is the transport of person(s) and/or goods using human muscle power.  Like animal-powered transport, human-powered transport has existed since time immemorial in the form of walking, running and swimming.  Modern technology has allowed machines to enhance human-power. Although motorization has increased speed and load capacity, many forms of human-powered transport remain popular for reasons of lower cost, leisure, physical exercise and environmentalism.  Human-powered transport is sometimes the only type available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions. Available muscle powerIn the 1989 Race Across America, one team (Team Strawberry)  used an experimental device comprising a rear wheel hub, a sensor, and a handlebar mounted processor, to measure each cyclist's power output. 

Iolanthe<====>46780<====>Iolanthe   DISPLAYTITLE Iolanthe; or, The Peer and the Peri ( ) is a comic opera with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W.  S.  Gilbert.  It is one of the Savoy operas and is the seventh of fourteen operatic collaborations by Gilbert and Sullivan.  In the opera, the fairy Iolanthe has been banished from fairyland because she married a mortal; this is forbidden by fairy law.  Her son, Strephon, is an Arcadian shepherd who wants to marry Phyllis, a Ward of Chancery.  All the members of the House of Peers also want to marry Phyllis. 

Daniel Bernoulli<====>46784<====>Daniel Bernoulli Daniel Bernoulli FRS ( ;  8 February 1700 – 17 March 1782) was a Swiss mathematician and physicist and was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the Bernoulli Brothers.  He is particularly remembered for his applications of mathematics to mechanics, especially fluid mechanics, and for his pioneering work in probability and statistics.  His name is commemorated in the Bernoulli's principle, a particular example of the conservation of energy, which describes the mathematics of the mechanism underlying the operation of two important technologies of the 20th century: the carburetor and the airplane wing. Early lifeDaniel Bernoulli was born in Groningen, in the Netherlands, into a family of distinguished mathematicians.

Jean-Baptiste Say<====>46789<====>Jean-Baptiste Say    Jean-Baptiste Say ( ; 5 January 1767 – 15 November 1832) was a French economist and businessman.  He had classically liberal views and argued in favor of competition, free trade, and lifting restraints on business.  He is best known for Say's Law, also known as the law of markets, which he popularized.  Scholars disagree on the surprisingly subtle question of whether it was Say who first stated what we now call Say's Law.   BiographyJean-Baptiste Say was born in Lyon.  His father, Jean-Etienne Say, was born to a Protestant family which had moved from Nîmes to Geneva for some time in consequence of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. 

Desert varnish<====>46790<====>Desert varnishDesert varnish or rock varnish is an orange-yellow to black coating found on exposed rock surfaces in arid environments.  Desert varnish is usually around one micrometer thick and represents nanometer-scale layering.   Rock rust and desert patina are other terms which are also used for the condition, but less often. FormationDesert varnish forms only on physically stable rock surfaces that are no longer subject to frequent precipitation, fracturing or wind abrasion.  The varnish is primarily composed of particles of clay along with iron and manganese oxides.    There is also a host of trace elements and almost always some organic matter. 

Death Valley National Park<====>46793<====>Death Valley National Park   Death Valley National Park is a national park in the United States.  Straddling the border of California and Nevada, located east of the Sierra Nevada, it occupies an interface zone between the arid Great Basin and Mojave deserts in the United States.  The park protects the northwest corner of the Mojave Desert and contains a diverse desert environment of salt-flats, sand dunes, badlands, valleys, canyons, and mountains.  It is the largest national park in the lower 48 states and has been declared an International Biosphere Reserve.  Approximately 91% of the park is a designated wilderness area. 

Mono Lake<====>46795<====>Mono Lake   Mono Lake (   ) is a large, shallow saline soda lake in Mono County, California, formed at least 760,000 years ago as a terminal lake in an endorheic basin.  The lack of an outlet causes high levels of salts to accumulate in the lake.  These salts also make the lake water alkaline. This desert lake has an unusually productive ecosystem based on brine shrimp that thrive in its waters, and provides critical nesting habitat for two million annual migratory birds that feed on the shrimp and blackflies (that also feed on the shrimp). 

Death Valley<====>46797<====>Death Valley  Death Valley is a desert valley located in Eastern California, in the northern Mojave Desert bordering the Great Basin Desert.  It is one of the hottest places in the world at the height of summertime along with deserts in Africa and in the Middle East.  Death Valley's Badwater Basin is the point of the lowest elevation in North America, at   below sea level.   This point is   east-southeast of Mount Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous United States with an elevation of 14,505 feet (4,421 m).   Death Valley's Furnace Creek holds the record for the highest reliably recorded air temperature in the world, 134 °F (56.

Continued fraction<====>46802<====>Continued fraction  In mathematics, a continued fraction is an expression obtained through an iterative process of representing a number as the sum of its integer part and the reciprocal of another number, then writing this other number as the sum of its integer part and another reciprocal, and so on.   In a finite continued fraction (or terminated continued fraction), the iteration/recursion is terminated after finitely many steps by using an integer in lieu of another continued fraction.  In contrast, an infinite continued fraction is an infinite expression.  In either case, all integers in the sequence, other than the first, must be positive. 

Long Valley Caldera<====>46811<====>Long Valley Caldera Long Valley Caldera is a depression in eastern California that is adjacent to Mammoth Mountain.  The valley is one of the Earth's largest calderas, measuring about   long (east-west),   wide (north-south), and up to   deep. Long Valley was formed 760,000 years ago when a supervolcanic eruption released very hot ash that later cooled to form the Bishop tuff that is common to the area.  The eruption emptied the magma chamber under the area to the point of collapse.  The second phase of the eruption released pyroclastic flows that burned and buried thousands of square miles. 

Mount Vesuvius<====>46817<====>Mount Vesuvius    Mount Vesuvius ( ;    ;  ;    ; also   or   in some Roman sources)  is a somma-stratovolcano located on the Gulf of Naples in Campania, Italy, about   east of Naples and a short distance from the shore.  It is one of several volcanoes which form the Campanian volcanic arc.  Vesuvius consists of a large cone partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera caused by the collapse of an earlier and originally much higher structure. Mount Vesuvius is best known for its eruption in AD 79 that led to the burying and destruction of the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, as well as several other settlements. 

Surveillance aircraft<====>46818<====>Surveillance aircraftA surveillance aircraft is an aircraft used for surveillance—collecting information over time.  They are operated by military forces and other government agencies in roles such as intelligence gathering, battlefield surveillance, airspace surveillance, observation (e. g.  artillery spotting), border patrol and fishery protection.  This article concentrates on aircraft used in those roles, rather than for traffic monitoring, law enforcement and similar activities. Surveillance aircraft usually carry no armament, or only limited defensive armament.  A surveillance aircraft does not necessarily require high-performance capability or stealth characteristics.  It may be a modified civilian aircraft.  Surveillance aircraft have also included moored balloons (e.

He is also remembered in the UK for presenting Points of View, a BBC Television programme featuring viewers' letters on the BBC's output,and the BBC Radio 4 programme The News Quiz. Early life and educationThe son of a manager at the Danish Bacon Company, Took was born in Muswell Hill    or Wood Green,  north London and brought up there during the war, running away from the home in Wisbech to which he had been evacuated. 

George V<====>46823<====>George V George V (George Frederick Ernest Albert; 3 June 1865 – 20 January 1936) was King of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, and Emperor of India, from 6 May 1910 until his death in 1936. He was the second son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra), and grandson of the then-reigning British monarch, Queen Victoria.  From the time of his birth, he was third in the line of succession behind his father and his own elder brother, Prince Albert Victor.  From 1877 to 1891, George served in the Royal Navy, until the unexpected death of his elder brother in early 1892 put him directly in line for the throne. 

Otto Hahn<====>46825<====>Otto Hahn  Otto Hahn,   (8 March 1879 – 28 July 1968)    was a German chemist and pioneer in the fields of radioactivity and radiochemistry.  He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1944 for the discovery and the radiochemical proof of nuclear fission  at the exclusion of his colleague Lise Meitner.  He is referred to as the father of nuclear chemistry.  Hahn was an opponent of national socialism and Jewish persecution by the Nazi Party.  Albert Einstein (who was born six days after him) wrote that Hahn was "one of the very few who stood upright and did the best he could in these years of evil".

Owens specialized in the sprints and the long jump and was recognized in his lifetime as "perhaps the greatest and most famous athlete in track and field history".   His achievement of setting three world records and tying another in less than an hour at the 1935 Big Ten track meet in Ann Arbor, Michigan, has been called "the greatest 45 minutes ever in sport"  and has never been equaled. 

Fertilisation<====>46828<====>Fertilisation    Fertilisation or fertilization (see spelling differences), also known as generative fertilisation, conception, fecundation, syngamy and impregnation,  is the fusion of gametes to initiate the development of a new individual organism.   The cycle of fertilisation and development of new individuals is called sexual reproduction.  During double fertilisation in angiosperms the haploid male gamete combines with two haploid polar nuclei to form a triploid primary endosperm nucleus by the process of vegetative fertilisation. HistoryIn 1784, Spallanzani established the need of interaction between the female's ovum and male's sperm to form a zygote. 

The Federalist Papers<====>46833<====>The Federalist Papers   The Federalist (later known as The Federalist Papers) is a collection of 85 articles and essays written under the pseudonym "Publius" by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay to promote the ratification of the United States Constitution.  Seventy-seven of these essays were published serially in the Independent Journal, the New York Packet, and The Daily Advertiser between October 1787 and August 1788.  A two-volume compilation of these and eight others was published in 1788 as The Federalist: A Collection of Essays, Written in Favour of the New Constitution, as Agreed upon by the Federal Convention, September 17, 1787. 

Federalist<====>46835<====>Federalist   The term federalist describes several political beliefs around the world.   Also, it may refer to the concept of parties; its members or supporters called themselves Federalists.  Latin AmericaIn the Spanish-speaking parts of Latin America the term "federalist" is used in reference to the politics of 19th-century Argentina and Colombia.   The Federalists opposed the Unitarians in Argentina and the Centralists in Colombia through the 19th century.  Federalists fought for complete self-government and full provincial autonomy, as opposed to the centralized government that the Unitarians and Centralists favored.  Furthermore, Federalists demanded tariff protection for their industries and, in Argentina, called for the end of the Buenos Aires customs as the only intermediary for foreign trade. 

David Lloyd George<====>46836<====>David Lloyd George    David Lloyd George, 1st Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor,    (17 January 1863 – 26 March 1945) was a British statesman of the Liberal Party.  As Chancellor of the Exchequer (1908–1915), Lloyd George was a key figure in the introduction of many reforms which laid the foundations of the modern welfare state.  His most important role came as the highly energetic Prime Minister of the Wartime Coalition Government (1916–22), during and immediately after the First World War.  He was a major player at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 that reordered Europe after the defeat of the Central Powers. 

Kinder Surprise<====>46839<====>Kinder SurpriseKinder Surprise, also known as a Kinder Egg or, in the original Italian, Kinder Sorpresa (sorpresa being Italian for "surprise"), is a candy manufactured by Italian company Ferrero.  It was invented by William Salice (1933–2016)    and is one of several candies sold under the Kinder Chocolate brand.  Intended for children, it is also popular with adult collectors  and has the form of a chocolate egg containing a small toy, usually requiring assembly. DescriptionEach Kinder Surprise egg consists of a chocolate shell, a plastic container, the contents of said container, and an external foil wrap. 

Fouquieria columnaris<====>46843<====>Fouquieria columnaris Fouquieria columnaris, the Boojum tree or cirio ( ) is a tree in the ocotillo family, whose other members include the ocotillos.  It is nearly endemic to the Baja California Peninsula (both the northern and southern states), with only a small population in the Sierra Bacha of Sonora, Mexico.  The plant's English name, Boojum, was given by Godfrey Sykes of the Desert Laboratory in Tucson, Arizona and is taken from Lewis Carroll's poem "The Hunting of the Snark".    DistributionThe peculiar distribution pattern of the mainland boojums has led Mexican botanists to conclude that they were probably transplanted to the mainland by the indigenous Seri people, who lived in this area and still live on communal property south of this location. 

August Weismann<====>46846<====>August WeismannFor the 19th-century New York politician, see Augustus Weismann.  August Friedrich Leopold Weismann (17 January 1834 – 5 November 1914) was a German evolutionary biologist.  Ernst Mayr ranked him as the second most notable evolutionary theorist of the 19th century, after Charles Darwin.  Weismann became the Director of the Zoological Institute and the first Professor of Zoology at Freiburg. His main contribution involved germ plasm theory, at one time also known as Weismannism, Romanes, George John.  An examination of Weismannism.

Spoon<====>46847<====>Spoon  A spoon is a utensil consisting of a small shallow bowl(also known as a head), oval or round, at the end of a handle.  A type of cutlery (sometimes called flatware in the United States), especially as part of a place setting, it is used primarily for serving.  Spoons are also used in food preparation to measure, mix, stir and toss ingredients.  Present day spoons are made from metal (notably flat silver or silverware, plated or solid), wood, porcelain or plastic. HistoryPreserved examples of various forms of spoons used by the ancient Egyptians include those composed of ivory, flint, slate and wood; many of them carved with religious symbols. 

George I of Great Britain<====>46852<====>George I of Great Britain   George I (George Louis;  ; 28 May 1660 – 11 June 1727)  was King of Great Britain and Ireland from 1 August 1714 and ruler of the Duchy and Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg (Hanover) in the Holy Roman Empire from 1698, until his death. George was born in Hanover and inherited the titles and lands of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg from his father and uncles.  A succession of European wars expanded his German domains during his lifetime, and in 1708 he was ratified as prince-elector of Hanover.  At the age of 54, after the death of his second cousin Queen Anne of Great Britain, George ascended the British throne as the first monarch of the House of Hanover. 

Indus Valley Civilisation<====>46853<====>Indus Valley CivilisationThe Indus Valley Civilisation  (IVC), or Harappan Civilisation,  was a Bronze Age civilisation (3300–1300 BCE; mature period 2600–1900 BCE) mainly in the northwestern regions of South Asia, extending from what today is northeast Afghanistan to Pakistan and northwest India.   Along with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of three early cradles of civilisations of the Old World, and of the three, the most widespread.   Aridification of this region during the 3rd millennium BCE may have been the initial spur for the urbanisation associated with the civilisation, but eventually also reduced the water supply enough to cause the civilisation's demise, and to scatter its population eastward. 

Wallis Simpson<====>46854<====>Wallis Simpson   Wallis, Duchess of Windsor (born Bessie Wallis Warfield; 19 June 1896  – 24 April 1986), commonly known by her second married name of Wallis Simpson and previously as Wallis Spencer, was an American socialite whose intended marriage to the British king Edward VIII caused a constitutional crisis that led to Edward's abdication. Wallis's father died shortly after her birth and she and her widowed mother were partly supported by their wealthier relatives.  Her first marriage, to U. S.  naval officer Win Spencer, was punctuated by periods of separation and eventually ended in divorce.  In 1931, during her second marriage, to Ernest Simpson, she met Edward, then Prince of Wales. 

Henry VI of England<====>46858<====>Henry VI of England    Henry VI (6 December 1421 – 21 May 1471) was King of England from 1422 to 1461 and again from 1470 to 1471, and disputed King of France from 1422 to 1453.  The only child of Henry V, he succeeded to the English throne at the age of nine months upon his father's death, and succeeded to the French throne on the death of his maternal grandfather Charles VI shortly afterwards. Henry inherited the long-running Hundred Years' War (1337–1453), in which Charles VII contested his claim to the French throne.  His early reign, during which several people were ruling for him, saw the height of English power in France, but subsequent military failures, the desertion of England's allies, and a faltering economy resulted in the decline of English fortunes in the war. 

Catalan's constant<====>46860<====>Catalan's constantIn mathematics, Catalan's constant  , which occasionally appears in estimates in combinatorics, is defined by G = \beta(2) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n}}{(2n+1)^2} = \frac{1}{1^2} - \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{5^2} - \frac{1}{7^2} + \frac{1}{9^2} - \cdots  where   is the Dirichlet beta function.  Its numerical value  is approximately    It is not known whether   is irrational, let alone transcendental.  Catalan's constant was named after Eugène Charles Catalan. The similar but apparently more complicated series  \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n}}{(2n+1)^3} = \frac{1}{1^3} - \frac{1}{3^3} + \frac{1}{5^3} - \frac{1}{7^3} + \frac{1}{9^3} - \cdots  can be evaluated exactly and is π 3 /32. 

Henry IV of England<====>46861<====>Henry IV of England   Henry IV ( 15 April 1367  – 20 March 1413), also known as Henry of Bolingbroke ( ), was King of England and Lord of Ireland from 1399 to 1413, and asserted the claim of his grandfather, Edward III, to the Kingdom of France. Henry was born at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire.  His father, John of Gaunt, was the fourth son of Edward III and the third son to survive to adulthood, and enjoyed a position of considerable influence during much of the reign of Henry's cousin Richard II, whom Henry eventually deposed. 

Asymmetric warfare<====>46863<====>Asymmetric warfareAsymmetric warfare (or asymmetric engagement) is war between belligerents whose relative military power differs significantly, or whose strategy or tactics differ significantly.  This is typically a war between a standing, professional army and an insurgency or resistance movement. Asymmetric warfare  can describe a conflict in which the resources of two belligerents differ in essence and in the struggle, interact and attempt to exploit each other's characteristic weaknesses.  Such struggles often involve strategies and tactics of unconventional warfare, the weaker combatants attempting to use strategy to offset deficiencies in quantity or quality.   Such strategies may not necessarily be militarized. 

Manzanar<====>46865<====>Manzanar  Manzanar is most widely known as the site of one of ten American concentration camps where over 110,000 Japanese Americans were unjustly incarcerated during World War II from December 1942 to 1945.  Located at the foot of the Sierra Nevada in California's Owens Valley between the towns of Lone Pine to the south and Independence to the north, it is approximately   north of Los Angeles.  Manzanar (which means "apple orchard" in Spanish) was identified by the United States National Park Service as the best-preserved of the former camp sites, and is now the Manzanar National Historic Site, which preserves and interprets the legacy of Japanese American incarceration in the United States. 

Puff pastry<====>46875<====>Puff pastry Puff pastry, also known as  , is a flaky light pastry containing several layers of butter which is in solid state at 20 °C (68 °F).   In raw form, puff pastry is a laminated dough composed of two elements: a "dough packet", the  , and a "butter packet" or other solid fat, the   Preparing a classic puff pastry requires an envelope formed by placing the beurrage inside the détrempe.   An "inverse puff" pastry envelope places the détrempe inside the beurrage.   The resulting   is repeatedly folded and rolled out before baking. 

Mince pie<====>46876<====>Mince pie A mince pie is a sweet pie of British origin, filled with a mixture of dried fruits and spices called "mincemeat", that is traditionally served during the Christmas season in the English-speaking world.  Its ingredients are traceable to the 13th century, when returning European crusaders brought with them Middle Eastern recipes containing meats, fruits and spices. The early mince pie was known by several names, including "mutton pie", "shrid pie" and "Christmas pie".  Typically its ingredients were a mixture of minced meat, suet, a range of fruits, and spices such as cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg.   Served around Christmas, the savoury Christmas pie (as it became known) was associated with supposed Catholic "idolatry" and during the English Civil War was frowned on by the Puritan authorities. 

Shortcrust pastry<====>46877<====>Shortcrust pastry  Shortcrust pastry is a type of pastry often used for the base of a tart, quiche or pie.  Shortcrust pastry can be used to make both sweet and savory pies such as apple pie, quiche, lemon meringue or chicken pie. ProportionsIt is based on a "half-fat-to-flour" ratio (twice as much flour as fat by weight).  Fat (lard, shortening, butter or full-fat margarine) is rubbed into plain flour to create a loose mixture that is then bound using a small amount of ice water, rolled out, then shaped and placed to create the top or bottom of a flan or pie. 

La Caletta<====>46878<====>La Caletta La Caletta is a small town, a harbour and a tourist destination in Sardinia, Italy.  Caletta means a small bay or little harbour. The town is located approximately 50 km south of Olbia, in the administrative territory of Siniscola (province of Nuoro), on the Tyrrhenian coast of the island. An ancient village of fishermen, its small gulf has been transformed in the 1970s into a touristic harbour, and recently renewed and enlarged.  The town (est.  1,000 inhabitants, that become more than 10,000 in Summer) is today deeply dependent on tourism and borders, at its northern side, with San Giovanni, the coastal fraction of Posada. 

Japanese American service in World War II<====>46880<====>Japanese American service in World War IIDuring the early years of World War II, Japanese Americans were forcibly relocated from their homes in the Pacific Coast states because military leaders and public opinion combined to fan unproven fears of sabotage.  As the war progressed, many of the young Nisei, Japanese immigrants' children who were born with American citizenship, volunteered or were drafted to serve in the United States military.  Japanese Americans served in all the branches of the United States Armed Forces, including the United States Merchant Marines.  The 442nd Infantry Regiment became the most decorated unit in U. 

Babylonia<====>46883<====>BabyloniaBabylonia was an ancient Akkadian-speaking state and cultural area based in central-southern Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq).  A small Amorite-ruled state emerged in 1894 BC, which contained at this time the minor administrative town of Babylon.   Babylon greatly expanded from the small provincial town that it had originally been during the Akkadian Empire (2335-2154 BC) during the reign of Hammurabi in the first half of the 18th century BC, becoming a major capital city.  During the reign of Hammurabi and afterwards, Babylonia was called Māt Akkadī "the country of Akkad" in the Akkadian language. 

Internment of Japanese Americans<====>46884<====>Internment of Japanese Americans  The internment of Japanese Americans in the United States during World War II was the forced relocation and incarceration in camps in the western interior of the country of between 110,000 and 120,000 Various primary and secondary sources list counts between persons.   people of Japanese ancestry, most of whom lived on the Pacific coast.  62 percent of the internees were United States citizens.

Leaning Tower of Pisa<====>46889<====>Leaning Tower of Pisa    The Leaning Tower of Pisa ( ) or simply the Tower of Pisa (Torre di Pisa  ) is the campanile, or freestanding bell tower, of the cathedral of the Italian city of Pisa, known worldwide for its unintended tilt.  The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry. The tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight. 

Frequency-hopping spread spectrum<====>46890<====>Frequency-hopping spread spectrum    Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) is a method of transmitting radio signals by rapidly switching a carrier among many frequency channels, using a pseudorandom sequence known to both transmitter and receiver.  It is used as a multiple access method in the code division multiple access (CDMA) scheme frequency-hopping code division multiple access (FH-CDMA) . FHSS is a wireless technology that spreads its signal over rapidly changing frequencies. Each available frequency band is divided into sub-frequencies.  Signals rapidly change ("hop") among these in a pre-determined order.  Interference at a specific frequency will only affect the signal during that short interval. 

Issei<====>46892<====>Issei   is a Japanese-language term used by ethnic Japanese in countries in North America and South America to specify the Japanese people who were the first generation to immigrate there.  Issei are born in Japan; their children born in the new country are Nisei (ni '2' + sei 'generation'); and their grandchildren are Sansei (san '3'). The character and uniqueness of the Issei is recognized in its social history.  HistoryThe earliest organized group of Japanese emigrants settled in Mexico in 1897.  Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Japan-Mexico Foreign Relations  In the 21st century, the four largest populations of diaspora Japanese and descendants of Japanese immigrants in the Western Hemisphere live in Brazil, the United States, Canada, and Peru. 

Sansei<====>46893<====>Sansei  is a Japanese and American English term  used in parts of the world such as South America and North America to specify the children of children born to Japanese people in the new country.   The nisei are considered the second generation, grandchildren of the Japanese-born immigrants are called Sansei and the fourth generation yonsei.    The children of at least one nisei parent are called Sansei.  Sansei are usually the first generation of whom a high percentage are mixed race, since their parents were usually born and raised in America.  The character and uniqueness of the sansei is recognized in its social history. 

Euler number<====>46895<====>Euler number In mathematics, the Euler numbers are a sequence E n  of integers   defined by the Taylor series expansion \frac{1}{\cosh t} = \frac{2}{e^{t} + e^ {-t} } = \sum_{n=0}^\infty  \frac{E_n}{n!} \cdot t^n ,where   is the hyperbolic cosine.  The Euler numbers are related to a special value of the Euler polynomials, namely: E_n=2^nE_n(\tfrac 12) The odd-indexed Euler numbers are all zero.  The even-indexed ones   have alternating signs.  Some values are:|E 0  ||=||align=right| 1|-|E 2  ||=||align=right| −1|-|E 4  ||=||align=right| 5|-|E 6  ||=||align=right| −61|-|E 8  ||=||align=right|  |-|E 10  ||=||align=right|  |-|E 12  ||=||align=right|  |-|E 14  ||=||align=right|  |-|E 16  ||=||align=right|  |-|E 18  ||=||align=right|  |}Some authors re-index the sequence in order to omit the odd-numbered Euler numbers with value zero, or change all signs to positive. 

Otter<====>46916<====>Otter   Otters are carnivorous mammals in the subfamily Lutrinae.  The 13 extant otter species are all semiaquatic, aquatic or marine, with diets based on fish and invertebrates.  Lutrinae is a branch of the weasel family Mustelidae, which also includes badgers, honey badgers, martens, minks, polecats, and wolverines. EtymologyThe word otter derives from the Old English word otor or oter.  This, and cognate words in other Indo-European languages, ultimately stem from the Proto-Indo-European language root *wódr̥, which also gave rise to the English word "water".   TerminologyAn otter's den is called a holt or couch. 

Egyptian language<====>46918<====>Egyptian language  The Egyptian language was spoken in ancient Egypt and was a branch of the Afro-Asiatic languages.  Its attestation stretches over an extraordinarily long time, from the Old Egyptian stage (mid-3rd millennium BC, Old Kingdom of Egypt).  Its earliest known complete written sentence has been dated to about 2690 BC, which makes it one of the oldest recorded languages known, along with Sumerian.  Its classical form is known as Middle Egyptian, the vernacular of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt which remained the literary language of Egypt until the Roman period.  The spoken language evolved into Demotic by the time of Classical Antiquity, and finally into Coptic by the time of Christianisation. 

Caesarean section<====>46924<====>Caesarean section   Caesarean section, also known as C-section or caesarean delivery, is the use of surgery to deliver one or more babies. A caesarean section is often necessary when a vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk.   This may include obstructed labour, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord.    A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section.    A trial of vaginal birth after C-section may be possible. 

Greyhawk<====>46925<====>Greyhawk    Greyhawk, also known as the World of Greyhawk, is a fictional world designed as a campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy roleplaying game.   Although not the first campaign world developed for Dungeons & Dragons—Dave Arneson's Blackmoor campaign predated it by over a year    — the world of Greyhawk closely identified with the development of the game from 1972 until 2008.  The world itself started as a simple dungeon under a castle designed by Gary Gygax for the amusement of his children and friends, but it rapidly expanded to include not only a complex multi-layered dungeon environment, but also the nearby city of Greyhawk, and eventually an entire world. 

Flanaess<====>46926<====>Flanaess The Flanaess is the eastern part of the continent of Oerik, one of the four continents of the fictional world of Oerth in the World of Greyhawk campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy roleplaying game.  The Flanaess has been the setting of dozens of adventures published between the 1970s and 2000s and continues to be the central focus of the campaign world. Development of the FlanaessIn late 1972, Dave Arneson demonstrated a new type of game to a group of gamers in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, including game designer Gary Gygax.  Gygax agreed to develop a set of rules with Arneson and get the game published; the game eventually became known as Dungeons & Dragons. 

Oerth<====>46927<====>Oerth  In the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game, Oerth    is the fictional planet on which one of the earliest campaign settings, the World of Greyhawk, is located.  Oerth has an axial tilt of 30 degrees, which would cause greater seasonal temperature variation than on Earth, were it not for wizardly and divine magic that shifts weather patterns to be more favorable to the populace (at least the god-fearing folks). DevelopmentCastle Greyhawk was the most famous dungeon in Oerth, the home campaign world of Gary Gygax.    Players in the earliest days of this campaign mostly stayed within Castle Greyhawk's dungeons, but Gygax envisioned the rest of his world as a sort of parallel Earth, and the original Oerth (pronounced "Oith", as with a Brooklyn accent) looked much like the real-world Earth but filled with imaginary cities and countries. 

Forgotten Realms<====>46928<====>Forgotten Realms   Forgotten Realms is a campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) fantasy role-playing game.  Commonly referred to by players and game designers alike as "The Realms", it was created by game designer Ed Greenwood around 1967 as a setting for his childhood stories.Several years later, Greenwood brought the setting to the D&D game as a series of magazine articles, and the first Realms game products were released in 1987.  Role-playing game products have been produced for the setting ever since, as have various licensed products including sword and sorcery novels, role-playing video game adaptations (including the first massively multiplayer online role-playing game to use graphics), and comic books. 

Ravenloft<====>46930<====>Ravenloft   Ravenloft is a campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game.   It is an alternate time-space existence known as a pocket dimension called the Demiplane of Dread, which consists of a collection of land pieces called domains brought together by a mysterious force known only as "The Dark Powers".   Each domain is mystically ruled by a being called a "Darklord". SettingRavenloft is primarily a Gothic horror setting.  Dungeon Masters are encouraged to use scenes that build apprehension and fear, culminating in the eventual face-to-face meeting with the nameless evil.    Characters have a much greater significance attached to their acts, especially if they are morally impure, as they risk coming under the influence of the Dark Powers (through the game process called "dark powers checks") and gradually transforming themselves into figures of evil. 

Mystara<====>46931<====>Mystara  Mystara is a campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role playing game.  It was the default setting for the "Basic" version of the game throughout the 1980s and 1990s.  Most adventures published for the "Basic" edition of D&D take place in "The Known World", a central continent that includes a varied patchwork of both human and non-human realms.  The human realms are based on various real-world historical cultures.  In addition, unlike other D&D settings, Mystara had ascended immortal beings instead of gods. The Mystara planet also has sub-settings.  The older Blackmoor setting was retconned to exist in Mystara's distant past. 

Planescape<====>46932<====>Planescape  Planescape is a campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, originally designed by Zeb Cook.   The Planescape setting was published in 1994.As its name suggests, the setting crosses and comprises the numerous planes of existence, encompassing an entire cosmology called the Great Wheel, as originally developed in the Manual of the Planes by Jeff Grubb.   This includes many of the other Dungeons & Dragons worlds, linking them via inter-dimensional magical portals. Development Planescape is an expansion of ideas presented in the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Master's Guide (First Edition) and the original Manual of the Planes. 

Spelljammer<====>46933<====>Spelljammer    Spelljammer is a campaign setting for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd edition) role-playing game, which features a fantastic (as opposed to scientific) outer space environment. Spelljammer introduced into the AD&D universe a comprehensive system of fantasy astrophysics, including the Ptolemaic concept of crystal spheres.  Crystal spheres may contain multiple worlds and are navigable using ships equipped with "spelljamming helms".  Ships powered by spelljamming helms are capable of flying into not only the sky but into space.   With their own fields of gravity and atmosphere, the ships have open decks and tend not to resemble the spaceships of science fiction, but instead look more like galleons, animals, birds, fish or even more wildly fantastic shapes. 

Drow (Dungeons & Dragons)<====>46934<====>Drow (Dungeons & Dragons)DISPLAYTITLE   The drow ( or  )  or dark elves are a generally evil, dark-skinned, and white-haired subrace of elves in the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy roleplaying game.  Publication historyThe word "drow" is from the Orcadian and Shetlandic dialects of Scots,  an alternative form of "trow",  which is a cognate with "troll".  The Oxford English Dictionary gives no entry for "drow", but two of the citations under "trow" name it as an alternative form of the word.  Trow/drow was used to refer to a wide variety of evil sprites. 

Angband<====>46936<====>Angband  In J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's fantasy world of Middle-earth, Angband (Sindarin for 'iron prison') is the name of the fortress of Melkor, constructed before the First Age, located in the Iron Mountains in the enemy's land Dor Daedeloth north of Beleriand.The fortress is described in Tolkien's The Silmarillion.  It was built by Melkor (later called Morgoth) to guard against a possible attack from Aman by the Valar.  Nonetheless, the Valar's attack succeeded in capturing Morgoth and destroying his main stronghold Utumno. However, while the Valar had focused on destroying Utumno utterly, Angband, though devastated, was only partially destroyed. 

Audio time stretching and pitch scaling<====>46943<====>Audio time stretching and pitch scaling Time stretching is the process of changing the speed or duration of an audio signal without affecting its pitch. Pitch scaling or pitch shifting is the opposite: the process of changing the pitch without affecting the speed.  Similar methods can change speed, pitch, or both at once, in a time-varying way. These processes are used, for instance, to match the pitches and tempos of two pre-recorded clips for mixing when the clips cannot be reperformed or resampled.  They are also used to create effects such as increasing the range of an instrument (like pitch shifting a guitar down an octave). 

Parallax scrolling<====>46944<====>Parallax scrolling  Parallax scrolling, also known as "Asymmetrical scrolling",  is a technique in computer graphics and web design, where background images move by the camera slower than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene and adding to the immersion.   The technique grew out of the multiplane camera technique used in traditional animation    since the 1930s.  Parallax scrolling was popularized in 2D computer graphics and video games by the arcade games Moon Patrol   and Jungle Hunt,  both released in 1982.  Some parallax scrolling had earlier been used by the 1981 arcade game Jump Bug. 

2013<====>46945<====>2013  2013 was designated as:International Year of Water Cooperation   International Year of Quinoa  EventsJanuaryJanuary 10 – More than 100 people are killed and 270 injured in several bomb blasts in Pakistan. January 11 – The French military begins a five-month intervention into the Northern Mali conflict, targeting the militant Islamist Ansar Dine group.   January 16–20 – Thirty-nine international workers and one security guard die in a hostage crisis at a natural gas facility near In Aménas, Algeria.  FebruaryFebruary 12 – North Korea conducts its third underground nuclear test, prompting widespread condemnation and tightened economic sanctions from the international community. 

Elizabethan era<====>46947<====>Elizabethan eraThe Elizabethan era is the epoch in the Tudor period of the history of England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558–1603).  Historians often depict it as the golden age in English history.  The symbol of Britannia was first used in 1572, and often thereafter, to mark the Elizabethan age as a renaissance that inspired national pride through classical ideals, international expansion, and naval triumph over the Spanish – at the time, a rival kingdom much hated by the people of the land.  In terms of the entire century, the historian John Guy (1988) argues that "England was economically healthier, more expansive, and more optimistic under the Tudors" than at any time in a thousand years. 

Libretto<====>46950<====>Libretto A libretto is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical.  The term libretto is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the Mass, requiem and sacred cantata, or the story line of a ballet. Libretto ( ; plural libretti  ), from Italian, is the diminutive of the word   ("book").  Sometimes other language equivalents are used for libretti in that language, livret for French works and Textbuch for German.  A libretto is distinct from a synopsis or scenario of the plot, in that the libretto contains all the words and stage directions, while a synopsis summarizes the plot. 

Chroma key<====>46953<====>Chroma key   Chroma key compositing, or chroma keying, is a visual effects / post-production technique for compositing (layering) two images or video streams together based on color hues (chroma range).  The technique has been used heavily in many fields to remove a   from the subject of a photo or video – particularly the newscasting, motion picture and videogame industries.  A color range in the foreground footage is made transparent, allowing separately filmed background footage or a static image to be inserted into the scene.  The chroma keying technique is commonly used in video production and post-production. 

Identity map pattern<====>46955<====>Identity map patternIn the design of database management systems, the identity map pattern is a database access design pattern used to improve performance by providing a context-specific, in-memory cache to prevent duplicate retrieval of the same object data from the database. If the requested data has already been loaded from the database, the identity map returns the same instance of the already instantiated object, but if it has not been loaded yet, it loads it and stores the new object in the map. In this way, it follows a similar principle to lazy loading.There are four types of Identity MapExplicitGenericSessionClassSee alsoDesign patternActive recordLazy loadingReferences   

Cepstrum<====>46956<====>Cepstrum  A cepstrum ( ,  ) is the result of taking the inverse Fourier transform (IFT) of the logarithm of the estimated spectrum of a signal.  It may be pronounced in the two ways given, the second having the advantage of avoiding confusion with "kepstrum", which also exists (see below).  There is a complex cepstrum, a real cepstrum, a power cepstrum, and a phase cepstrum. The power cepstrum in particular finds applications in the analysis of human speech. The name "cepstrum" was derived by reversing the first four letters of "spectrum".  Operations on cepstra are labelled quefrency analysis (aka quefrency alanysis ), liftering, or cepstral analysis. 

Koch snowflake<====>46959<====>Koch snowflakeThe Koch snowflake (also known as the Koch curve, Koch star, or Koch island ) is a mathematical curve and one of the earliest fractal curves to have been described.  It is based on the Koch curve, which appeared in a 1904 paper titled "On a continuous curve without tangents, constructible from elementary geometry" (original French title: Sur une courbe continue sans tangente, obtenue par une construction géométrique élémentaire)  by the Swedish mathematician Helge von Koch. The progression for the area of the snowflake converges to   times the area of the original triangle, while the progression for the snowflake's perimeter diverges to infinity. 

Thomas Crapper<====>46961<====>Thomas Crapper   Thomas Crapper (baptised 28 September 1836; died 27 January 1910) was a plumber who founded Thomas Crapper & Co in London.  He was noted for the quality of his products and received several royal warrants. Manhole covers with Crapper's company's name on them in Westminster Abbey are now one of London's minor tourist attractions. Thomas Crapper & Co owned the world's first bath, toilet and sink showroom, in King's Road until 1966.

Cunt<====>46963<====>Cunt  Cunt   is a vulgar word for the vulva or vagina and is also used as a term of disparagement.  Reflecting different national usages, cunt is described as "an unpleasant or stupid person" in the Compact Oxford English Dictionary, whereas Merriam-Webster states that it is a "usually disparaging and obscene" term for a woman    or an "offensive way to refer to a woman" in the United States.The Macquarie Dictionary of Australian English gives "a contemptible person".   In Britain, New Zealand, and Australia, it can also be used as a neutral or, when used with a positive qualifier (good, funny, clever, etc. 

Sleep disorder<====>46966<====>Sleep disorder A sleep disorder, or somnipathy, is a medical disorder of the sleep patterns of a person or animal.   Some sleep disorders are serious enough to interfere with normal physical, mental, social and emotional functioning.  Polysomnography and actigraphy are tests commonly ordered for some sleep disorders. Disruptions in sleep can be caused by a variety of issues, from teeth grinding (bruxism) to night terrors.   When a person suffers from difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep with no obvious cause, it is referred to as insomnia.  Sleep disorders are broadly classified into dyssomnias, parasomnias, circadian rhythm sleep disorders involving the timing of sleep, and other disorders including ones caused by medical or psychological conditions and sleeping sickness. 

Castalia<====>46978<====>Castalia  Castalia ( ;  ), in Greek mythology, was a nymph whom Apollo transformed into a fountain at Delphi, at the base of Mount Parnassos, or at Mount Helicon.   Castalia could inspire the genius of poetry to those who drank her waters or listened to their quiet sound; the sacred water was also used to clean the Delphian temples.  Apollo consecrated Castalia to the Muses (Castaliae Musae). The 20th century German writer Hermann Hesse used Castalia as inspiration for the name of the futuristic fictional utopia in his 1943 magnum opus, The Glass Bead Game. 

Pollen<====>46980<====>Pollen  Pollen is a fine to coarse powdery substance comprising pollen grains which are male microgametophytes of seed plants, which produce male gametes (sperm cells).  Pollen grains have a hard coat made of sporopollenin that protects the gametophytes during the process of their movement from the stamens to the pistil of flowering plants, or from the male cone to the female cone of coniferous plants.  If pollen lands on a compatible pistil or female cone, it germinates, producing a pollen tube that transfers the sperm to the ovule containing the female gametophyte.  Individual pollen grains are small enough to require magnification to see detail. 

Scutum (constellation)<====>46981<====>Scutum (constellation)   Scutum is a small constellation introduced in the seventeenth century.  Its name is Latin for shield. HistoryScutum was named in 1684 by Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius  (Jan Heweliusz), who originally named it Scutum Sobiescianum (Shield of Sobieski) to commemorate the victory of the Christian forces led by Polish King John III Sobieski (Jan III Sobieski) in the Battle of Vienna in 1683.  Later, the name was shortened to Scutum. Five bright stars of Scutum (α Sct, β Sct, δ Sct, ε Sct and η Sct) were previously known as 1, 6, 2, 3, and 9 Aquilae respectively. 

Transmission system<====>46982<====>Transmission system See Transmission (mechanics) for a car's transmission systemIn telecommunications, a transmission system is a system that transmits a signal from one place to another.  The signal can be an electrical, optical or radio signal. Some transmission systems contain multipliers, which amplify a signal prior to re-transmission, or regenerators, which attempt to reconstruct and re-shape the coded message before re-transmission. One of the most widely used transmission system technologies in the Internet and the PSTN is SONET. Also, transmission system is the medium through which data is transmitted from one point to another.  Examples of common transmission systems people use everyday are: the internet, mobile network, cordless cables, etc. 

Echion (painter)<====>46984<====>Echion (painter)Echion ( ), also known as Aetion, was a celebrated Greek painter spoken of by Lucian,  who gives a description of one of his pictures, representing the marriage of Alexander and Roxana.  This painting excited such admiration when exhibited at the Olympic Games, that Proxenidas, one of the judges, gave the artist his daughter in marriage.  Echion seems to have excelled particularly in the art of mixing and laying on his colors.  It has commonly been supposed that he lived in the time of Alexander the Great; but the words of Lucian show clearly that he must have lived about the time of Hadrian and the Antonines. 

Grand Canyon National Park<====>46986<====>Grand Canyon National Park   Grand Canyon National Park is the 15th site in the United States to have been named a national park.  Named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979, the park is located in northwestern Arizona.  The park's central feature is the Grand Canyon, a gorge of the Colorado River, which is often considered one of the Wonders of the World.  The park, which covers   of unincorporated area in Coconino and Mohave counties, received nearly six million recreational visitors in 2016, which is the second highest count of all U. S. 

Grand Canyon<====>46989<====>Grand Canyon The Grand Canyon (Hopi: Ongtupqa;, Navajo: Tsékooh Hatsoh, Spanish: Gran Cañón) is a steep-sided canyon carved by the Colorado River in Arizona, United States.  The Grand Canyon is   long, up to   wide and attains a depth of over a mile ( ).  The canyon and adjacent rim are contained within Grand Canyon National Park, the Kaibab National Forest, Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument, the Hualapai Indian Reservation, the Havasupai Indian Reservation and the Navajo Nation.  President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent of preservation of the Grand Canyon area, and visited it on numerous occasions to hunt and enjoy the scenery. 

Bryce Canyon National Park<====>46991<====>Bryce Canyon National Park    Bryce Canyon National Park   is a United States national park located in southwestern Utah.  The major feature of the park is Bryce Canyon, which despite its name, is not a canyon, but a collection of giant natural amphitheaters along the eastern side of the Paunsaugunt Plateau.  Bryce is distinctive due to geological structures called hoodoos, formed by frost weathering and stream erosion of the river and lake bed sedimentary rocks.  The red, orange, and white colors of the rocks provide spectacular views for park visitors.  Bryce sits at a much higher elevation than nearby Zion National Park. 

Czech literature<====>46992<====>Czech literature Czech literature is the literature written in the Czech language. The earliest literary works written in Czech date to the 14th century.  Modern literature may be divided into the periods of national awakening in the 19th century; the avantgarde of the interwar period; the years under Communism and the Prague Spring; and the literature of the post-Communist Czech Republic.  In another meaning of the term, , "Czech literature" may refer to "literature written by Czechs" regardless of language, including works in  Old Church Slavonic, Middle Latin or German.  Middle Latin worksBohemia was Christianized in the late 9th to 10th centuries, and the earliest written works associated with the kingdom of Bohemia are Middle Latin works written in the 12th to 13th centuries (with the exception of the Latin Legend of Christian, supposedly of the 10th century but of dubious authenticity). 

Jaroslav Foglar<====>46993<====>Jaroslav Foglar Jaroslav Foglar (6 July 1907 – 23 January 1999) was a famous Czech author who wrote many novels about youths (partly also about Boy Scouts movement) and their adventures in nature and dark city streets. Early lifeFoglar was born and grew up in Prague, capital of Bohemia.  Because his father died prematurely he was brought up in rather poor material conditions by his mother.  He was strongly influenced by romantic parts of Prague.  All of the fictional towns in his novels are more or less derived from Prague.  During the 1920s, Foglar was strongly influenced by German independent Wandervogel movement as well as Scout movement led by Antonín Benjamin Svojsík under Czech name Junák. 

Marcus Licinius Crassus<====>46996<====>Marcus Licinius Crassus   Marcus Licinius Crassus ( ;  c.  115–53 BC) was a Roman general and politician who played a key role in the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire.  Crassus began his public career as a military commander under Lucius Cornelius Sulla during his civil war.  Following Sulla's assumption of the dictatorship, Crassus amassed an enormous fortune through real estate speculation.  Crassus rose to political prominence following his victory over the slave revolt led by Spartacus, sharing the consulship with his rival Pompey the Great. A political and financial patron of Julius Caesar, Crassus joined Caesar and Pompey in the unofficial political alliance known as the First Triumvirate. 

Buffer solution<====>46999<====>Buffer solution A buffer solution (more precisely, pH buffer or hydrogen ion buffer) is an aqueous solution consisting of a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, or vice versa.  Its pH changes very little when a small amount of strong acid or base is added to it.  Buffer solutions are used as a means of keeping pH at a nearly constant value in a wide variety of chemical applications.  In nature, there are many systems that use buffering for pH regulation.  For example, the bicarbonate buffering system is used to regulate the pH of blood. 

Colocation centre<====>47000<====>Colocation centre    A colocation centre (also spelled co-location, or colo) or "carrier hotel", is a type of data centre where equipment, space, and bandwidth are available for rental to retail customers.   Colocation facilities provide space, power, cooling, and physical security for the server, storage, and networking equipment of other firms—and connect them to a variety of telecommunications and network service providers—with a minimum of cost and complexity. ConfigurationMany colocation providers sell to a wide range of customers, ranging from large enterprises to small companies.   Typically, the customer owns the IT equipment and the facility provides power and cooling. 

Colo (gorilla)<====>47004<====>Colo (gorilla) Colo (December 22, 1956 – January 17, 2017) was a western gorilla widely known as the first gorilla to be born in captivity anywhere in the world and as the oldest known gorilla in the world.  Colo was born at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium to Millie Christina (mother) and Baron Macombo (father), and lived there for her entire life.  She was briefly called Cuddles before a contest was held to officially name her.  (Mrs.  Howard Brannon of Zanesville, Ohio, won the contest. )  Colo's name was derived from the place of her birth, Columbus, Ohio. 

Telephone company<====>47005<====>Telephone companyA telephone company, also known as a telco, telephone service provider,  or telecommunications operator, is a kind of communications service provider (CSP) (more precisely a telecommunications service provider or TSP) that provides telecommunications services such as telephony and data communications access.  Many telephone companies were at one time government agencies or privately owned but state-regulated monopolies.  The government agencies are often referred to, primarily in Europe, as PTTs (postal, telegraph and telephone services).  Telephone companies are common carriers, and in the United States are also called local exchange carriers.  With the advent of mobile telephony, telephone companies now include wireless carriers, or mobile network operators. 

Elfstedentocht<====>47008<====>Elfstedentocht The Elfstedentocht ( ;  West Frisian: Alvestêdetocht  , English: Eleven cities tour) is a skating tour, almost   long, which is held both as a speed skating competition (with 300 contestants) and a leisure tour (with 16,000 skaters).  It is held in the province of Friesland in the north of the Netherlands, leading past all eleven historical cities of the province.  The tour is held at most once a year, only when the natural ice along the entire course is at least   thick;  sometimes on consecutive years, other times with gaps that may exceed 20 years.

Arrhenius equation<====>47011<====>Arrhenius equationThe Arrhenius equation is a formula for the temperature dependence of reaction rates.  The equation was proposed by Svante Arrhenius in 1889, based on the work of Dutch chemist Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff who had noted in 1884 that Van 't Hoff's equation for the temperature dependence of equilibrium constants suggests such a formula for the rates of both forward and reverse reactions.  This equation has a vast and important application in determining rate of chemical reactions and for calculation  of energy of activation.  Arrhenius provided a physical justification and interpretation for the formula. 

Peering<====>47012<====>Peering In computer networking, peering is a voluntary interconnection of administratively separate Internet networks for the purpose of exchanging traffic between the users of each network.  The pure definition of peering is settlement-free, also known as "bill-and-keep," or "sender keeps all," meaning that neither party pays the other in association with the exchange of traffic; instead, each derives and retains revenue from its own customers. An agreement by two or more networks to peer is instantiated by a physical interconnection of the networks, an exchange of routing information through the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing protocol and, in some special cases, a formalized contractual document. 

Free World<====>47013<====>Free World  The term Free World is a politically-charged term that was used during the Cold War to refer to the Western Bloc.  Even more broadly, it was used to refer to all non-communist countries.  It has traditionally primarily been used to refer to the countries allied and aligned with the United States and those affiliated with international organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union. Origins During World War II, the Allied powers viewed themselves as opposing the oppression and fascism of the Axis powers, thus making them "free".  Following the end of World War II, the Cold War conception of the "Free World" included only anti-communist states as being "free", particularly capitalist states which were said to have free speech, a free press, freedom of assembly and freedom of association. 

Metric time<====>47014<====>Metric time Metric time is the measure of time interval using the metric system, which defines the second as the base unit of time, and multiple and submultiple units formed with metric prefixes, such as kiloseconds and milliseconds.  It does not define the time of day, as this is defined by various time scales, which may be based upon the metric definition of the second.  Other units of time, the minute, hour, and day, are accepted for use with the modern metric system, but are not part of it. HistoryAlthough part of the decimal metric system, the second derives its name from the sexagesimal system, which originated with the Sumerians and Babylonians, and divides a base unit into sixty minutes, minutes into sixty seconds, seconds into sixty tierces,  etc. 

Commentarii de Bello Gallico<====>47016<====>Commentarii de Bello Gallico  Commentāriī dē Bellō Gallicō ( ), also Bellum Gallicum ( ), is Julius Caesar's firsthand account of the Gallic Wars, written as a third-person narrative.  In it Caesar describes the battles and intrigues that took place in the nine years he spent fighting the Germanic peoples and Celtic peoples in Gaul that opposed Roman conquest. The "Gaul" that Caesar refers to is ambiguous, as the term had various connotations in Roman writing and discourse during Caesar's time.  Generally, Gaul included all of the regions that Romans had not conquered or administered or which were primarily inhabited by Celts; except for the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis (modern-day Provence and Languedoc-Roussillon), which had already been conquered in Caesar's time, therefore encompassing the rest of modern France, Belgium, Western Germany, and parts of Switzerland. 

Package manager<====>47017<====>Package manager A package manager or package management system is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner. A package manager deals with packages, distributions of software and data in archive files.  Packages contain metadata, such as the software's name, description of its purpose, version number, vendor, checksum, and a list of dependencies necessary for the software to run properly.  Upon installation, metadata is stored in a local package database.  Package managers typically maintain a database of software dependencies and version information to prevent software mismatches and missing prerequisites. 

London Internet Exchange<====>47023<====>London Internet Exchange The London Internet Exchange ("LINX") is a mutually governed Internet exchange point (IXP) that provides peering services and public policy representation to over 500 Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and other network operators.  LINX operates IXPs in London, Manchester (IXManchester), Edinburgh (IXScotland), Cardiff, and North Virginia, USA (LINX NoVA). LINX was founded in 1994 by a group of ISPs and educational networks and is a founder member of Euro-IX, a Europe-wide alliance of Internet Exchanges.  It is currently one of the largest neutral IXPs in Europe in terms of average throughput. 

Cinna<====>47027<====>Cinna Cinna was a cognomen that distinguished a patrician branch of the gens Cornelia, particularly in the late Roman Republic. Prominent members of this family include:Lucius Cornelius Cinna, consul four consecutive times 87–84 BC, a popularist leader allied with Gaius Marius against Sulla, and at the time of his death the father-in-law of Julius Caesar. Cornelia, the wife of Julius Caesar, and mother of his only legitimate child. Lucius Cornelius Cinna (suffect consul), the son of Lucius Cornelius Cinna and a praetor; he was a conspirator against Caesar. Helvius Cinna, a poet murdered for having the same name as the assassin Cinna during the riots following Caesar's death. 

Painter's algorithm<====>47028<====>Painter's algorithm The painter's algorithm, also known as a priority fill, is one of the simplest solutions to the visibility problem in 3D computer graphics.  When projecting a 3D scene onto a 2D plane, it is necessary at some point to decide which polygons are visible, and which are hidden. The name "painter's algorithm" refers to the technique employed by many painters for painting distant parts of a scene before parts which are nearer thereby covering some areas of distant parts.  The painter's algorithm sorts all the polygons in a scene by their depth and then paints them in this order, farthest to closest. 

Scanline rendering<====>47029<====>Scanline renderingScanline rendering (also scan line rendering and scan-line rendering) is an algorithm for visible surface determination, in 3D computer graphics,that works on a row-by-row basis rather than a polygon-by-polygon or pixel-by-pixel basis.   All of the polygons to be rendered are first sorted by the top y coordinate at which they first appear, then each row or scan line of the image is computed using the intersection of a scanline with the polygons on the front of the sorted list, while the sorted list is updated to discard no-longer-visible polygons as the active scan line is advanced down the picture. 

Lucius Cornelius Cinna<====>47030<====>Lucius Cornelius Cinna Lucius Cornelius Cinna  (died 84 BC) was a four-time consul of the Roman Republic, serving four consecutive terms from 87 to 84 BC, and a member of the ancient Roman Cinna family of the Cornelii gens. Cinna's influence in Rome exacerbated the tensions which existed between Gaius Marius and Lucius Cornelius Sulla.  After the death of Marius, he became the leading power in Rome until his own death.  His main impact upon Roman politics was his ability to veil his tyranny and make it appear that he was working under a constitutional government.  His policies also impinged on Julius Caesar, who married his daughter. 

Offa of Mercia<====>47037<====>Offa of Mercia    Offa was King of Mercia, a kingdom of Anglo-Saxon England, from 757 until his death in July 796.  The son of Thingfrith and a descendant of Eowa, Offa came to the throne after a period of civil war following the assassination of Æthelbald.  Offa defeated the other claimant, Beornred.  In the early years of Offa's reign, it is likely that he consolidated his control of Midland peoples such as the Hwicce and the Magonsæte.  Taking advantage of instability in the kingdom of Kent to establish himself as overlord, Offa also controlled Sussex by 771, though his authority did not remain unchallenged in either territory.

Catherine of Valois<====>47072<====>Catherine of Valois    Catherine of Valois (27 October 1401 – 3 January 1437 ) was the queen consort of England from 1420 until 1422.  A daughter of Charles VI of France, she married Henry V of England,  and gave birth to his heir Henry VI of England.  Her liaison (and possible secret marriage) with Owen Tudor proved the springboard of that family's fortunes, eventually leading to their grandson's elevation as Henry VII of England.   Catherine's older sister Isabella was queen of England from 1396 until 1399, as the child bride of Richard II. 

Fishbourne Roman Palace<====>47082<====>Fishbourne Roman Palace Fishbourne Roman Palace is in the village of Fishbourne, Chichester in West Sussex.  The palace is the largest residential Roman building discovered in Britain  and has an unusually early date of 75 AD, around thirty years after the Roman conquest of Britain.  Its many superb mosaic floors dating from this period make it even more exceptional.  Much of the palace has been excavated and is preserved, along with an on-site museum.  The rectangular palace surrounded formal gardens, the northern parts of which have been reconstructed. Extensive alterations were made in the 2nd and 3rd centuries when many of the original black and white mosaics were overlaid with more sophisticated coloured work, including the perfectly preserved dolphin mosaic in the north wing. 

Carrier-sense multiple access<====>47083<====>Carrier-sense multiple access Carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) is a media access control (MAC) protocol in which a node verifies the absence of other traffic before transmitting on a shared transmission medium, such as an electrical bus or a band of the electromagnetic spectrum. A transmitter attempts to determine whether another transmission is in progress before initiating a transmission using a carrier-sense mechanism.  That is, it tries to detect the presence of a carrier signal from another node before attempting to transmit.  If a carrier is sensed, the node waits for the transmission in progress to end before initiating its own transmission. 

List of Welsh people<====>47085<====>List of Welsh people This is a list of Welsh people ( ); an ethnic group and nation associated with Wales. Historian John Davies argues that the origin of the Welsh nation can be traced to the late 4th and early 5th centuries, following the Roman departure from Britain, although Brythonic or other Celtic languages seem to have been spoken in Wales since much earlier.   This list is for people of Welsh heritage and descent, and for those otherwise perceived as Welsh; through either birth or adoption.  Only those meeting notability criteria are included.  A few people appear in more than one section of the list.

IP over Avian Carriers<====>47102<====>IP over Avian CarriersIn computer networking, IP over Avian Carriers (IPoAC) is a humorously intended proposal to carry Internet Protocol (IP) traffic by birds such as homing pigeons.  IP over Avian Carriers was initially described in RFC 1149, a Request for Comments (RFC) issued by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) written by D.  Waitzman and released on April 1, 1990.  It is one of several April Fools' Day RFCs. Waitzman described an improvement of his protocol in RFC 2549, IP over Avian Carriers with Quality of Service (1 April 1999).  Later, in RFC 6214 released on 1 April 2011, and 13 years after the introduction of IPv6, Carpenter and Hinden published Adaptation of RFC 1149 for IPv6. 

Alphonse de Polignac<====>47106<====>Alphonse de Polignac Alphonse de Polignac (1826–1863) was a French mathematician. In 1849, the year he was admitted to Polytechnique, he made what's known as Polignac's conjecture:For every positive integer k, there are infinitely many prime gaps of size 2k.The case k = 1 is the twin prime conjecture.His father, Jules de Polignac (1780-1847) was prime minister of Charles X until the Bourbon dynasty was overthrown (1830).See alsode Polignac's formulaReferences  DEFAULTSORT

Also called Darius the Great, he ruled the empire at its peak, when it included much of West Asia, the Caucasus, parts of the Balkans (Thrace-Macedonia and Paeonia), most of the Black Sea coastal regions, parts of the North Caucasus, Central Asia, as far as the Indus Valley in the far east, and portions of north and northeast Africa including Egypt (Mudrâya),  eastern Libya and coastal Sudan.   Darius ascended the throne by overthrowing Gaumata, the alleged magus usurper of Bardiya with the assistance of six other Persian noble families; Darius was crowned the following morning. 

Darius II<====>47121<====>Darius II  Darius II (Old Persian: Dārayavahuš), was king of the Persian Empire from 423 BC to 404   or 405 BC.  The Elephantine papyri mention Darius II as a contemporary of the high priest Johanan of Ezra 10:6.   Artaxerxes I, who died on December 25, 424 BC, was followed by his son Xerxes II.  After a month and a half Xerxes II was murdered by his brother Secydianus or Sogdianus (the form of the name is uncertain).  His illegitimate brother, Ochus, satrap of Hyrcania, rebelled against Sogdianus, and after a short fight killed him, and suppressed by treachery the attempt of his own brother Arsites to imitate his example. 

Darius III<====>47122<====>Darius III Darius III (c.  380 – July 330 BC), originally named Artashata and called Codomannus by the Greeks,    was the last king of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia from 336 BC to 330 BC.  Artashata adopted Darius as a dynastic name.  His empire was unstable, with large portions governed by jealous and unreliable satraps and inhabited by disaffected and rebellious subjects. In 334 BC, Alexander the Great began his invasion of the Persian Empire and subsequently defeated the Persians in a number of battles before looting and destroying the capital Persepolis by fire in 330 BC. 

Henry John Stephen Smith<====>47123<====>Henry John Stephen Smith Henry John Stephen Smith (2 November 1826 – 9 February 1883) was a mathematician remembered for his work in elementary divisors, quadratic forms, and Smith–Minkowski–Siegel mass formula in number theory.  In matrix theory he is visible today in having his name on the Smith normal form of a matrix. LifeEducationSmith was born in Dublin, Ireland, the fourth child of John Smith, a barrister, who died when Henry was two.  His mother very soon afterwards moved the family to England.  He had thirteen siblings, including Eleanor Smith, who became a prominent educational activist.   He lived in several places in England as a boy, and had private tutors for his education. 

The King's School, Canterbury<====>47124<====>The King's School, Canterbury The King's School is a selective British co-educational independent school for both day and boarding pupils in the English city of Canterbury in Kent.  It is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and the Eton Group.   It is held to be the oldest continuously operating school in the world, having been founded in 597 AD.   It is a "public school" in the British sense of the term. HistoryThe school originated as a medieval cathedral school said to have been founded during the Late Antiquity in 597 AD, a century after the Fall of the Roman Empire, by Augustine of Canterbury considered the "Apostle to the English" and a founder of the English Church, therefore making it the world's oldest extant school. 

Easter Bunny<====>47125<====>Easter Bunny   The Easter Bunny (also called the Easter Rabbit or Easter Hare) is a  folkloric figure and symbol of Easter, depicted as a rabbit bringing Easter eggs.  Originating among German Lutherans, the "Easter Hare" originally played the role of a judge, evaluating whether children were good or disobedient in behaviour at the start of the season of Eastertide.   The Easter Bunny is sometimes depicted with clothes.  In legend, the creature carries colored eggs in his basket, candy, and sometimes also toys to the homes of children, and as such shows similarities to Santa Claus or the Christkind, as they both bring gifts to children on the night before their respective holidays. 

Doe Maar<====>47126<====>Doe Maar Doe Maar is a Dutch ska band with punk and reggae influences.  Their career ran from 1978 to 1984 and they were one of the most successful pop bands in Dutch history.

HistoryEarly years and debut albumDoe Maar was formed in 1978 by Ernst Jansz (CCC Inc. , Slumberlandband).  Piet Dekker, with whom Jansz played in The Slumberlandband (1975) and The Rumbones (1977), introduced him to Jan Hendriks and Carel Copier, spring 1978 at the farm of Gé van de Donk, their later sound engineer. 

Baby boomers<====>47127<====>Baby boomers   Baby boomers are the demographic cohort following the Silent Generation.  There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends; demographers and researchers typically use starting birth years ranging from the early-to-mid 1940s and ending birth years ranging from 1960 to 1964. The term "baby boomer" is also used in a cultural context, so it is difficult to achieve broad consensus of a precise date definition.  Different people, organizations, and scholars have varying opinions on who is a baby boomer, both technically and culturally.  Ascribing universal attributes to such a generation is difficult, and some believe it is inherently impossible, but many have attempted to determine their cultural similarities and historical impact, and the term has thus gained widespread popular usage. 

Ivan Novikoff<====>47128<====>Ivan NovikoffIvan Novikoff (August 26, 1899 – March 20, 2002) was a ballet master. Born in Kazan, Russia, Novikoff studied and graduated from the Imperial Ballet School aka Mariinsky.  He fled to Harbin, China because of the Russian Revolution of 1917 at age 17, where he taught dance for the community of Russians. In 1923, he immigrated to the United States, where he continued teaching ballet until his death.  After arriving in San Francisco, Novikoff moved to New York City where Novikoff and his brother Boris Novikoff together directed Metropolitan Opera Ballet Company.  Moving westwards to Seattle, he founded the Novikoff School of Russian-American Ballet in the early 1950s and received the Governor's Heritage Award (of the state of Washington) in 1989. 

Nederpop<====>47135<====>Nederpop  Nederpop is a Dutch term that was invented by the mid-1970s to describe the Dutch pop music scene of the 1960s and 1970s that was gaining worldwide attention, exemplified by bands such as Shocking Blue, Golden Earring and Focus. The name is a play on the country's name in Dutch (Nederland).  An English translation could be Netherpop.  Most of the Nederpop bands of this period had English-language songs or played only instrumentals, but some of the bands performed exclusively in the Dutch language.  Many such were popular thanks to airplay over the offshore pirate radio stations targeting the Netherlands such as Mi Amigo, Veronica, Atlantis and Northsea International. 

Ying Wa College<====>47136<====>Ying Wa College    Ying Wa College (also referred to as YWC, Anglo-Chinese College,  ) is a direct subsidised boys' secondary school in Kowloon, Hong Kong.  It was established in Malacca in 1818 by the first Protestant missionary to China, Rev.  Robert Morrison.  In 1843, the college was moved to Hong Kong. The College Deed, signed in 1821, stated that the objective of the school was the reciprocal cultivation of English and Chinese literature as well as the diffusion of Christianity ( ).  These aims remain today in the context of a very different world. 

Logarithmic integral function<====>47137<====>Logarithmic integral functionIn mathematics, the logarithmic integral function or integral logarithm li(x) is a special function.  It is relevant in problems of physics and has number theoretic significance, occurring in the prime number theorem as an estimate of the number of prime numbers less than a given value. Integral representationThe logarithmic integral has an integral representation defined for all positive real numbers   ≠ 1 by the definite integral  {\rm li} (x) =   \int_0^x \frac{dt}{\ln t}~.   Here,   denotes the natural logarithm.  The function   has a singularity at   = 1, and the integral for   > 1 has to be interpreted as a Cauchy principal value,  {\rm li} (x) = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0+} \left( \int_0^{1-\varepsilon} \frac{dt}{\ln t} + \int_{1+\varepsilon}^x \frac{dt}{\ln t} \right)~. 

Incandescent light bulb<====>47139<====>Incandescent light bulb  An incandescent light bulb, incandescent lamp or incandescent light globe is an electric light with a wire filament heated to such a high temperature that it glows with visible light (incandescence).  The filament, heated by passing an electric current through it, is protected from oxidation with a glass or fused quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated.  In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is slowed by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life.  The light bulb is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass.

List of minor-planet groups<====>47143<====>List of minor-planet groupsA minor-planet group is a population of minor planets that share broadly similar orbits.  Members are generally unrelated to each other, unlike in an asteroid family, which often results from the break-up of a single asteroid.  It is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered, which is often the largest. Groups out to the orbit of EarthThere are relatively few asteroids that orbit close to the Sun.  Several of these groups are hypothetical at this point in time, with no members having yet been discovered; as such, the names they have been given are provisional.

Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson<====>47151<====>Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson (born March 28, 1941 as Jeffrey Lloyd Masson) is an American author.  Masson is best known for his conclusions about Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis.  In his The Assault on Truth (1984), Masson argues that Freud may have abandoned his seduction theory because he feared that granting the truth of his female patients' claims (that they had been sexually abused) would hinder the acceptance of his psychoanalytic methods.  Masson is a veganism advocate and has written about animal rights.Most of his books since 1997 are about animals.

After the war, Novello contributed numbers to several successful musical comedies and was eventually commissioned to write the scores of complete shows. 

Means of production<====>47155<====>Means of production  In economics and sociology, the means of production are physical, non-human and non-financial inputs used for the production of economic value: raw materials, the facilities, machinery and tools used in the production of goods.    In the terminology of classical economics, the means of production are the "factors of production" minus financial capital and minus human capital. The social means of production are capital goods and assets that require organized collective labor effort to operate, as opposed to individual workers acting alone.   The ownership and organization of the social means of production is a key factor in categorizing and defining the types of economic systems.

Punitive damages<====>47165<====>Punitive damages Punitive damages, or exemplary damages, are damages intended to reform or deter the defendant and others from engaging in conduct similar to that which formed the basis of the lawsuit.  Although the purpose of punitive damages is not to compensate the plaintiff, the plaintiff will receive all or some of the punitive damages award. Punitive damages are often awarded if compensatory damages are deemed an inadequate remedy.  The court may impose them to prevent undercompensation of plaintiffs and to allow redress for undetectable torts and taking some strain away from the criminal justice system.   Punitive damages are most important for violations of the law that are hard to detect. 

Route flapping<====>47167<====>Route flappingIn computer networking and telecommunications, route flapping occurs when a router alternately advertises a destination network via one route then another (or as unavailable, and then available again) in quick sequence.  A closely related term is interface flapping where an interface on a router has a hardware failure that will cause the router to announce it alternately as "up" and "down". Route flapping is caused by pathological conditions (hardware errors, software errors, configuration errors, intermittent errors in communications links, unreliable connections, etc. ) within the network which cause certain reachability information to be repeatedly advertised and withdrawn.  In networks with link-state routing protocols, route flapping will force frequent recalculation of the topology by all participating routers. 

Navy List<====>47170<====>Navy List  A Navy List or Naval Register is an official list of naval officers, their ranks and seniority, the ships which they command or to which they are appointed, etc. , that is published by the government or naval authorities of a country. BackgroundThe Navy List fulfills an important function in international law in that warships are required by article 29 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to be commanded by a commissioned officer whose name appears in the appropriate service list.  Past copies of the Navy List are also important sources of information for historians and genealogists.

HistoryTallangatta was founded in the 1870s, the Post Office opening on 15 May 1871.    On the arrival of the railway it served as a rail gateway for the Mitta and Upper Murray valleys (the Upper Murray only until the railway was extended to Cudgewa).   A considerable amount of gold and tin mining occurred in the late 19th and early 20th century, though, unlike Beechworth, little evidence for this remains. 

Weimar<====>47198<====>Weimar  Weimar ( ;  ) is a city in the federal state of Thuringia, Germany.  It is located between Erfurt in the west and Jena in the east, approximately   southwest of Leipzig,   north of Nuremberg and   west of Dresden.  Together with the neighbour-cities Erfurt and Jena it forms the central metropolitan area of Thuringia with approximately 500,000 inhabitants, whereas the city itself counts a population of 65,000.  Weimar is well known because of its large cultural heritage and its importance in German history. The city was a focal point of the German Enlightenment and home of the leading characters of the literary genre of Weimar Classicism, the writers Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller. 

4 Vesta<====>47200<====>4 Vesta    Vesta, minor-planet designation 4 Vesta, is one of the largest objects in the asteroid belt, with a mean diameter of  .   It was discovered by the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers on 29 March 1807  and is named after Vesta, the virgin goddess of home and hearth from Roman mythology. Vesta is the second-most-massive and second-largest body in the asteroid belt after the dwarf planet Ceres,   and it contributes an estimated 9% of the mass of the asteroid belt.   It is slightly larger than Pallas,  though significantly more massive.

Orpheus in the Underworld<====>47203<====>Orpheus in the Underworld  Orphée aux enfers, whose title translates from the French as Orpheus in the Underworld, is an opéra bouffe (a form of operetta), or opéra féerie in its revised version.  Its score was composed by Jacques Offenbach to a French text written by Ludovic Halévy and later revised by Hector-Jonathan Crémieux. The work, first performed in 1858, is said to be the first classical full-length operetta.    Offenbach's earlier operettas were small-scale one-act works, since the law in France did not allow full-length works of certain genres.   Orpheus was not only longer, but more musically adventurous than Offenbach's earlier pieces. 

Hagbard Celine<====>47206<====>Hagbard Celine   Freeman Hagbard Celine, H. M. , S. H.  is a central protagonist in the Illuminatus trilogy of books by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson, named after the legendary Viking hero Hagbard who died for love.  In the Schrödinger's Cat trilogy, written after Illuminatus!, it is stated that 'Hagbard Celine' is a pseudonym, and his legal name is 'Howard Crane'.   However, the trilogy passes through many very different universes. CharacterHagbard has parallels to Jules Verne's character, Captain Nemo.  Both are genius captains aboard a fantastic submarine.  Both are rogues who have mostly broken off from society, yet help the oppressed. 

52 Europa<====>47209<====>52 Europa  52 Europa is the 6th-largest asteroid in the asteroid belt, having an average diameter of around 315 km.  It is not round but is shaped like a triaxial ellipsoid of approximately 380×330×250 km. It was discovered on February 4, 1858, by Hermann Goldschmidt from his balcony in Paris.  It is named after Europa, one of Zeus's conquests in Greek mythology, a name it shares with Jupiter's moon Europa. Physical characteristicsEuropa is approximately the sixth largest asteroid by volume.  Most likely it has a density of around 1. 5 g/cm³, typical of C-type asteroids. 

Vesta (mythology)<====>47210<====>Vesta (mythology) Vesta ( ) is the virgin goddess of the hearth, home, and family in Roman religion.  She was rarely depicted in human form, and was often personified by the fire of her temple in the Forum Romanum.  Entry to her temple was permitted only to her priestesses, the Vestals, who tended the sacred fire at the hearth in her temple.  As she was considered a guardian of the Roman people, her festival, the Vestalia (7-15 June), was regarded as one of the most important Roman holidays.   During the Vestalia matrons of the city walked barefoot to the sanctuary of the goddess, and gave offerings. 

4769 Castalia<====>47216<====>4769 Castalia The asteroid 4769 Castalia (   ; previously known by the provisional designation  ) is an asteroid, classified as near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group, approximately 1. 4 kilometer in diameter.  It was the first asteroid to be modeled by radar imaging.  It was discovered on 9 August 1989, by American astronomer Eleanor Helin (Caltech) on photographic plates taken at Palomar Observatory in California.  It is named after Castalia, a nymph in Greek mythology.  It is also a Mars- and Venus-crosser asteroid.  General informationOn 25 August 1989 Castalia passed    (within eleven lunar distances) of Earth, allowing it to be observed with radar from the Arecibo Observatory by Scott Hudson (Washington State University) and Steven J.

Europa (mythology)<====>47219<====>Europa (mythology)  In Greek mythology, Europa ( ;  ,  ) was the mother of King Minos of Crete, a woman with Phoenician origin of high lineage, and after whom the continent Europe was named.  The story of her abduction by Zeus in the form of a white bull was a Cretan story; as classicist Károly Kerényi points out, "most of the love-stories concerning Zeus originated from more ancient tales describing his marriages with goddesses.  This can especially be said of the story of Europa. " Europa's earliest literary reference is in the Iliad, which is commonly dated to the 8th century BC.

Byzantine troops under General Niketas Chalkoutzes occupy Cyprus, liberating the Greek population from Muslim domination.  The Byzantine attempt to recover Sicily fails, when the Byzantine fleet is annihilated by the Fatimids at the Battle of the Straits. 

3753 Cruithne<====>47222<====>3753 Cruithne 3753 Cruithne (    For instance, on the British television show Q. I.  (Episode 2, Season 1; aired 11 Sept 2003).   or) is a Q-type, Aten asteroid in orbit around the Sun in 1:1 orbital resonance with Earth, making it a co-orbital object.  It is an asteroid that, relative to Earth, orbits the Sun in a bean-shaped orbit that effectively describes a horseshoe, and that can transition into a quasi-satellite orbit.   Cruithne does not orbit Earth and at times it is on the other side of the Sun,  placing Cruithne well outside of Earth's Hill sphere. 

4179 Toutatis<====>47226<====>4179 Toutatis 4179 Toutatis (   ), provisional designation  , is an elongated, stony asteroid and slow rotator, classified as near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo and Alinda group, approximately 2. 5 kilometers in diameter.  Discovered by French astronomer Christian Pollas at Caussols in 1989, the asteroid was named after Toutatis from Celtic mythology.   Toutatis is also a Mars-crosser asteroid with a chaotic orbit produced by a 3:1 resonance with the planet Jupiter, a 1:4 resonance with the planet Earth, and frequent close approaches to the terrestrial planets, including Earth.   In December 2012, Toutatis passed within about 18 lunar distances of Earth. 

Io (mythology)<====>47229<====>Io (mythology)Io ( ;    ) was, in Greek mythology, one of the mortal lovers of Zeus.  She was an ancestor of many kings and heroes such as Perseus, Cadmus, Heracles, Minos, Lynceus, Cepheus, and Danaus.  The astronomer Simon Marius named a moon of Jupiter after Io in 1614. LegendIn most versions of the legend, Io was the daughter of Inachus,  Apollodorus, Bibliotheca, 2. 1. 3  though various other purported genealogies are also known.  According to some sources her mother was the nymph Melia, daughter of Oceanus.  Apollodorus, Bibliotheca, 2. 

253 Mathilde<====>47232<====>253 Mathilde  253 Mathilde   is an asteroid in the intermediate asteroid belt, approximately 50 kilometers in diameter, that was discovered by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at Vienna Observatory on 12 November 1885.  It has a relatively elliptical orbit that requires more than four years to circle the Sun.  This tumbling asteroid has an unusually slow rate of rotation, requiring 17. 4 days to complete a 360°   about its axis.  It is a primitive C-type asteroid, which means the surface has a high proportion of carbon; giving it a dark surface that reflects only 4% of the light that falls on it. 

16 Psyche<====>47235<====>16 Psyche 16 Psyche (   ) is one of the ten most massive asteroids in the asteroid belt.  It is over 200 km (120 mi) in diameter and contains a little less than 1% of the mass of the entire asteroid belt.  It is thought to be the exposed iron core of a protoplanet.It is the most massive metallic M-type asteroid.  Psyche was discovered by the Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis on 17 March 1852 from Naples and named after the Greek mythological figure Psyche.  SymbolThe first fifteen asteroids to be discovered were given symbols by astronomers as a type of shorthand notation. 

Psyche (band)<====>47236<====>Psyche (band)   Psyche are a Canadian dark synthpop band, now based in Germany.  They are centered on singer Darrin Huss, who has been the only constant member, with various line-ups including his brother Stephen Huss, later followed by David Kristian, Per-Anders Kurenbach, and Remi Szyszka, all recording albums with Darrin under the name Psyche.  HistoryFormationPsyche was formed by brothers Darrin and Stephen Huss    in Edmonton, Alberta, named after the B-Side of Killing Joke's Wardance single as well as being chosen for the meaning of the word.  The band's debut performance was on December 13, 1982 with Dwayne Goettel on additional keyboards. 

Amalthea (moon)<====>47242<====>Amalthea (moon)    Amalthea (   ;  ) is the third moon of Jupiter in order of distance from the planet.  It was discovered on 9 September 1892, by Edward Emerson Barnard and named after Amalthea, a nymph in Greek mythology.   It is also known as  . Amalthea is in a close orbit around Jupiter and is within the outer edge of the Amalthea Gossamer Ring, which is formed from dust ejected from its surface.   From its surface, Jupiter would appear 46. 5 degrees in diameter.   Amalthea is the largest of the inner satellites of Jupiter. 

Amalthea (mythology)<====>47249<====>Amalthea (mythology)  In Greek mythology, Amaltheia ( ) is the most-frequently mentioned foster-mother of Zeus. OverviewThe name Amaltheia, in Greek "tender goddess", is clearly an epithet, signifying the presence of an earlier nurturing goddess,  whom the Hellenes, whose myths we know, knew to be located in Crete, where Minoans may have called her a version of "Dikte".  There were different traditions regarding Amaltheia.  Amaltheia is sometimes represented as the goat who nurtured the infant-god in a cave in Cretan Mount Aigaion ("Goat Mountain"),  sometimes as a goat-tending nymph  of uncertain parentage (the daughter of Oceanus,  Helios,  Haemonius,  or—according to Lactantius—Melisseus ),  The possession of multiple and uncertain mythological parents indicates wide worship of a deity in many cultures having varying local traditions. 

Richeza of Lotharingia<====>47253<====>Richeza of LotharingiaRicheza of Lotharingia (also called Richenza, Rixa, Ryksa; born about 995/1000 – 21 March 1063) was a German noblewoman by birth, a member of the Ezzonen dynasty.  She married Duke Mieszko II Lambert, later King of Poland, becoming Queen consort of Poland.  She returned to Germany following the deposition of her husband in 1031, later becoming a nun, and today is revered as Blessed Richeza of Lotharingia. Richeza had three known children: Casimir I the Restorer, Ryksa, Queen of Hungary, and Gertruda, Grand Princess of Kiev.  She was also noted in 2009 as the putative mother of Agatha, wife of Edward the Exile and mother of Margaret of Wessex.

Effect of taxes and subsidies on price<====>47261<====>Effect of taxes and subsidies on price  Taxes and subsidies change the price of goods and, as a result, the quantity consumed. Subsidy impactMarginal subsidies on production will shift the supply curve to the right until the vertical distance between the two supply curves is equal to the per unit subsidy; when other things remain equal, this will decrease price paid by the consumers (which is equal to the new market price) and increase the price received by the producers.   Similarly, a marginal subsidy on consumption will shift the demand curve to the right; when other things remain equal, this will decrease the price paid by consumers and increase the price received by producers by the same amount as if the subsidy had been granted to producers. 

2 Pallas<====>47262<====>2 Pallas    Pallas, minor-planet designation 2 Pallas, is the second asteroid to have been discovered (after Ceres), and is one of the largest asteroids in the Solar System.  With an estimated 7% of the mass of the asteroid belt, it is the third-most-massive asteroid, being 10–30% less massive than Vesta.    It is   in diameter, somewhat smaller than Vesta.  It is likely a remnant protoplanet. When Pallas was discovered by the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers on 28 March 1802, it was counted as a planet, as were other asteroids in the early 19th century. 

243 Ida<====>47263<====>243 Ida    243 Ida ( ) is an asteroid in the Koronis family of the asteroid belt.  It was discovered on 29 September 1884, by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at Vienna Observatory and named after a nymph from Greek mythology.  Later telescopic observations categorized Ida as an S-type asteroid, the most numerous type in the inner asteroid belt.  On 28 August 1993, Ida was visited by the unmanned Galileo spacecraft, while en route to Jupiter.  It was the second asteroid visited by a spacecraft and the first found to have a natural satellite. 

Asteroid belt<====>47264<====>Asteroid belt The asteroid belt is the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter.  It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets.  The asteroid belt is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids.About half the mass  of the belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea.   The total mass of the asteroid belt is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200 km). 

Deadweight loss<====>47265<====>Deadweight loss A deadweight loss, also known as excess burden or allocative inefficiency, is a loss of economic efficiency that can occur when equilibrium for a good or a service is not achieved.  That can be caused by monopoly pricing in the case of artificial scarcity, an externality, a tax or subsidy, or a binding price ceiling or price floor such as a minimum wage. ExamplesAn example is a market for nails where the cost of each nail is $0. 10 and the demand decreases linearly, from a high demand for free nails to zero demand for nails at $1. 

UNICOS<====>47266<====>UNICOS UNICOS is the name of a range of Unix-like operating system variants developed by Cray for its supercomputers.  UNICOS is the successor of the Cray Operating System (COS).  It provides network clustering and source code compatibility layers for some other Unixes.  UNICOS was originally introduced in 1985 with the Cray-2 system and later ported to other Cray models.  The original UNICOS was based on UNIX System V Release 2, and had numerous BSD features (e. g. , networking and file system enhancements) added to it. DevelopmentCX-OS was the original name given to what is now UNICOS. 

Four Corners Monument<====>47270<====>Four Corners Monument  The Four Corners Monument marks the quadripoint in the Southwestern United States where the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah meet.   It is the only point in the United States shared by four states, leading to the area being named the Four Corners region.The monument also marks the boundary between two semi-autonomous Native American governments, the Navajo Nation, which maintains the monument as a tourist attraction, and the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe Reservation. The origins of the state boundaries marked by the monument occurred just prior to, and during, the American Civil War, when the United States Congress acted to form governments in the area to combat the spread of slavery to the region. 

Sponge<====>47271<====>Sponge    Sponges, the members of the phylum Porifera ( ; meaning "pore bearer"), are a basal Metazoa clade as sister of the Diploblasts.  They are multicellular organisms that have bodies full of pores and channels allowing water to circulate through them, consisting of jelly-like mesohyl sandwiched between two thin layers of cells. Sponges have unspecialized cells that can transform into other types and that often migrate between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the process.  Sponges do not have nervous, digestive or circulatory systems.  Instead, most rely on maintaining a constant water flow through their bodies to obtain food and oxygen and to remove wastes. 

Pannonia<====>47277<====>Pannonia    Pannonia was an ancient province of the Roman Empire bounded north and east by the Danube, coterminous westward with Noricum and upper Italy, and southward with Dalmatia and upper Moesia.  Pannonia was located over the territory of the present-day western Hungary, eastern Austria, northern Croatia, north-western Serbia, northern Slovenia, western Slovakia and northern Bosnia and Herzegovina. Name Julius Pokorny believes the name Pannonia is derived from Illyrian, from the Proto-Indo-European root *pen-, "swamp, water, wet" (cf.  English fen, "marsh"; Hindi pani, "water").  Others believe that the name is related to the god of the nature, goats and shepherds Pan and/or pan, the Proto-Slavic/Proto-Indo-European word for lord/master, which could mean Pan's Land or Land of the Master(s), which is more probable due the fact the Ionian fleet supplied Pannonia via Black Sea and Danube, and Panionium festivities were also well known in the region to its Celtic, Adriatic Veneti and Scythian inhabitants. 

Cognitive bias<====>47278<====>Cognitive bias  A cognitive bias is a systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment.   Individuals create their own "subjective social reality" from their perception of the input.  An individual's construction of social reality, not the objective input, may dictate their behaviour in the social world.   Thus, cognitive biases may sometimes lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called irrationality. Some cognitive biases are presumably adaptive.  Cognitive biases may lead to more effective actions in a given context.   Furthermore, cognitive biases enable faster decisions when timeliness is more valuable than accuracy, as illustrated in heuristics. 

Closed set<====>47279<====>Closed set In geometry, topology, and related branches of mathematics, a closed set is a set whose complement is an open set.    In a topological space, a closed set can be defined as a set which contains all its limit points.  In a complete metric space, a closed set is a set which is closed under the limit operation. Equivalent definitions of a closed setIn a topological space, a set is closed if and only if it coincides with its closure.  Equivalently, a set is closed if and only if it contains all of its limit points. 

Infrastructure bias<====>47280<====>Infrastructure biasIn economics and social policy, infrastructure bias is the influence of the location and availability of pre-existing infrastructure, such as roads and telecommunications facilities, on social and economic development. In science, infrastructure bias is the influence of existing social or scientific infrastructure on scientific observations. In astronomy and particle physics, where the availability of particular kinds of telescopes or particle accelerators acts as a constraint on the types of experiments that can be done, the data that can be retrieved is biased towards that which can be obtained by the equipment. Procedural bias, related to infrastructure bias, is shown by a case of irregular genetic sampling of Bolivian wild potatoes. 

Distinct (mathematics)<====>47285<====>Distinct (mathematics) In mathematics, two things are called distinct if they are not equal.  In physics two things are distinct if they cannot be mapped to each other.  ExampleA quadratic equation over the complex numbers has two roots. The equation x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0 factors as (x - 1)(x - 2) = 0 and thus has as roots x = 1 and x = 2. Since 1 and 2 are not equal, these roots are distinct. In contrast, the equation: x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 factors as (x - 1)(x - 1) = 0 and thus has as roots x = 1 and x = 1. 

Dalmatia<====>47286<====>Dalmatia  Dalmatia ( ,  ; see names in other languages) is one of the four historical regions of Croatia,    alongside Croatia proper, Slavonia and Istria. Dalmatia is a narrow belt of the east shore of the Adriatic Sea, stretching from island of Rab in the north to the Bay of Kotor in the south.  The hinterland (Dalmatian Zagora) ranges in width from fifty kilometres in the north, to just a few kilometres in the south; it is mostly covered by the rugged Dinaric Mountains.  Seventy-nine islands (and about 500 islets) run parallel to the coast, the largest (in Dalmatia) being Brač, Pag and Hvar. 

FastTrack<====>47289<====>FastTrack  FastTrack is a peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol that was used by the Kazaa, Grokster, iMesh, and Morpheus file sharing programs.  FastTrack was the most popular file sharing network in 2003, and used mainly for the exchange of music mp3 files.  The network had approximately 2. 4 million concurrent users in 2003.  It is estimated that the total number of users was greater than that of Napster at its peak. HistoryThe FastTrack protocol and Kazaa were created and developed by Estonian programmers of BlueMoon Interactive headed by Jaan Tallinn, the same team that later created Skype.  After selling it to Niklas Zennström from Sweden and Janus Friis from Denmark, it was introduced in March 2001 by their Dutch company Consumer Empowerment. 

Master of Business Administration<====>47293<====>Master of Business Administration The Master of Business Administration (MBA or M. B. A. ) is a master's degree in business administration (management).  The MBA degree originated in the United States in the early 20th century when the country industrialized and companies sought scientific approaches to management.  The core courses in an MBA program cover various areas of business such as accounting, applied statistics, business communication, business ethics, business law, finance, managerial economics, management, marketing and operations in a manner most relevant to management analysis and strategy.  Most programs also include elective courses and concentrations for further study in a particular area, for example accounting, finance, and marketing. 

Hapi (Son of Horus)<====>47295<====>Hapi (Son of Horus)This article is about the funerary deity.  Hapi can also refer to Hapi, a Nile god, or Hapi-ankh, bull deity of Memphis.  Hapi, sometimes transliterated as Hapy, is one of the Four sons of Horus in ancient Egyptian religion, depicted in funerary literature as protecting the throne of Osiris in the Underworld.  Hapi was the son of Heru-ur and Isis or Serqet.  He is not to be confused with another god of the same name.  He is commonly depicted with the head of a hamadryas baboon, and is tasked with protecting the lungs of the deceased, hence the common depiction of a hamadryas baboon head sculpted as the lid of the canopic jar that held the lungs. 

Movable type<====>47300<====>Movable type  Movable type (US English; moveable type in British English) is the system and technology of printing and typography that uses movable components to reproduce the elements of a document (usually individual letters or punctuation) usually on the medium of paper. The world's first movable type printing press technology for printing paper books was made of porcelain materials and was invented around AD 1040 in China during the Northern Song Dynasty by the inventor Bi Sheng (990–1051).Subsequently in 1377, the world's oldest extant movable metal print book, Jikji, was printed in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty. 

Striptease<====>47309<====>Striptease A striptease is an erotic or exotic dance in which the performer gradually undresses, either partly or completely, in a seductive and sexually suggestive manner.   The person who performs a striptease is commonly known as a "stripper" or exotic dancer. In Western countries, the venues where stripteases are performed on a regular basis are now usually called strip clubs, though they may be performed in venues such as pubs (especially in the UK), theaters and music halls.  At times, a stripper may be hired to perform at a bachelor or bachelorette party.  In addition to providing adult entertainment, stripping can be a form of sexual play between partners. 

Dog paddle<====>47311<====>Dog paddleThe dog paddle or doggy paddle is a simple swimming style.   It is characterized by the swimmer lying on their chest and moving their hands and legs alternately in a manner reminiscent of how dogs and other quadrupedal mammals swim.   It is effectively a "trot" in water, instead of land.  It was the first swimming stroke used by ancient humans, believed to have been learned by observing animals swim.    Prehistoric cave paintings in Egypt show figures doing what appears to be the dog paddle.  It is often the first swim stroke used by young children when they are learning to swim. 

Treading water<====>47316<====>Treading water  Treading water or water treading is what a swimmer can do while in a vertical position to keep their head above the surface of the water, while not providing sufficient directional thrust to overcome inertia and propel the swimmer in any specific direction. As such, the phrase "treading water" has become a euphemism for an effort expected to create motion, but which actually results in merely staying in one, possibly barely sustainable, place.  MethodsAny sort of movement that allows the swimmer to do this can be classified as treading water, but it is more efficient to move the arms and legs in a specific fashion. 

Vault (gymnastics)<====>47319<====>Vault (gymnastics) The vault is an artistic gymnastics apparatus on which gymnasts perform, as well as the skill performed using that apparatus.  Vaulting is also the action of performing a vault.  Both male and female gymnasts perform the vault.  The English abbreviation for the event in gymnastics scoring is VTThe apparatusEarly forms of the vault were invented by German Friedrich Ludwig Jahn.  The apparatus itself originated as a "horse", much like the pommel horse but without the handles; it was sometimes known as the vaulting horse.  The horse was set up with its long dimension perpendicular to the run for women, and parallel for men. 

Horizontal bar<====>47321<====>Horizontal bar The horizontal bar, also known as the high bar, is an apparatus used by male gymnasts in artistic gymnastics.  It traditionally consists of a cylindrical metal (typically steel) bar that is rigidly held above and parallel to the floor by a system of cables and stiff vertical supports.  Gymnasts typically wear suede leather grips while performing on the bar.   Current elite-level competition uses a more elastic fiberglass core rail similar in material to the rails used in the women's uneven bars and men's parallel bars apparatus. The gymnastics elements performed on the horizontal bar are regulated by a Code of Points. 

Perch<====>47325<====>PerchPerch is a common name for fish of the genus Perca, freshwater gamefish belonging to the family Percidae.   The perch, of which there are three species in different geographical areas, lend their name to a large order of vertebrates: the Perciformes, from the Greek perke, simply meaning perch, and the Latin forma meaning shape.   Many species of freshwater gamefish more or less resemble perch, but belong to different genera.  In fact, the exclusively saltwater-dwelling red drum is often referred to as a red perch, though by definition perch are freshwater fish. 

Trout<====>47326<====>Trout   Trout is  the common name for a number of species of freshwater fish belonging to the genera Oncorhynchus, Salmo and Salvelinus, all of the  subfamily Salmoninae of the family Salmonidae.   The word trout is also used as part of the name of some non-salmonid fish such as Cynoscion nebulosus, the spotted seatrout or speckled trout. Trout are closely related to salmon and char (or charr): species termed salmon and char occur in the same genera as do fish  (Oncorhynchus - Pacific salmon and trout,  Salmo - Atlantic salmon and various trout, Salvelinus - char and trout). 

Trolling (fishing)<====>47327<====>Trolling (fishing)  Trolling is a method of fishing where one or more fishing lines, baited with lures or bait fish, are  drawn through the water.  This may be behind a moving boat, or by slowly winding the line in when fishing from a static position, or even sweeping the line from side-to-side, e. g.  when fishing from a jetty.  Trolling is used to catch pelagic fish such as salmon, mackerel and kingfish. Trolling can be phonetically confused with trawling, a different method of fishing where a net (trawl) is drawn through the water instead of lines. 

Mackerel<====>47332<====>Mackerel   Mackerel is a common name applied to a number of different species of pelagic fish, mostly, but not exclusively, from the family Scombridae.  They are found in both temperate and tropical seas, mostly living along the coast or offshore in the oceanic environment.  Mackerel typically have vertical stripes on their backs and deeply forked tails.  Many species are restricted in their distribution ranges, and live in separate populations or fish stocks based on geography.  Some stocks migrate in large schools along the coast to suitable spawning grounds, where they spawn in fairly shallow waters. 

Bluefish<====>47333<====>Bluefish  The bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) is the only extant species of the family Pomatomidae.  It is a marine pelagic fish found around the world in temperate and subtropical waters, except for the northern Pacific Ocean.   Bluefish are known as tailor in Australia,  elf in South Africa, and shad in KwaZulu-Natal.   Other common names are blue, chopper, and anchoa. It is a popular gamefish. The bluefish is a moderately proportioned fish, with a broad, forked tail.  The spiny first dorsal fin is normally folded back in a groove, as are its pectoral fins. 

Catfish<====>47335<====>Catfish Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish.  Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, Vandellia cirrhosa.  There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales.  Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. 

Fishing rod<====>47337<====>Fishing rod A fishing rod  is a long, flexible rod used to catch fish.  At its simplest, a fishing rod is a simple stick or pole attached to a line ending in a hook (formerly known as an angle, hence the term angling).  The length of the rod can vary between  .  To entice fish, bait or lures are impaled on one or more hooks attached to the line.  The line is generally stored on a reel which reduces tangles and assists in landing a fish. Traditionally rods are made from bamboo, while contemporary rods are usually made from fibreglass or carbon fibre. 

Fishing reel<====>47338<====>Fishing reel A fishing reel is a cylindrical device attached to a fishing rod used in winding and stowing line.  Modern fishing reels usually have fittings aiding in casting for distance and accuracy, as well as retrieving line.  Fishing reels are traditionally used in the recreational sport of angling and competitive casting.   They are typically attached to a fishing rod, though some specialized reels are mounted directly to boat gunwales or transoms. The fishing reel was invented in Song dynasty China, where the earliest known illustration of a fishing reel is from Chinese paintings and records beginning about 1195 AD. 

Fishing line<====>47339<====>Fishing line A fishing line is a cord used or made for angling.  Important parameters of a fishing line are its length, material, and weight (thicker lines are more visible to fish).  Factors that may determine what line an angler chooses for a given fishing environment include breaking strength, knot strength, UV resistance, castability, limpness, stretch, abrasion resistance, and visibility.  Most modern lines are made from nylon or silk.  TerminologyFish are caught with a fishing line by encouraging a fish to bite on a fish hook.  A fish hook will pierce the mouthparts of a fish and is normally barbed to make escape less likely.

Bass (fish)<====>47344<====>Bass (fish) Bass (   ) is a name shared by many species of fish.  The term encompasses both freshwater and marine species, all belonging to the large order Perciformes, or perch-like fishes.  The word bass comes from Middle English bars, meaning "perch".  TypesThe black basses, such as the Choctaw bass (Micropterus  haiaka), Guadalupe bass (M.  treculii), largemouth bass (M.  salmoides), smallmouth bass (M.  dolomieu), and spotted bass (M.  punctulatus) belong to the sunfish family, Centrarchidae.

Micropterus<====>47345<====>Micropterus Micropterus is a genus of freshwater fish in the sunfish family (family Centrarchidae) of order Perciformes.   The species of this genus are known as the black bass. The black bass are sometimes erroneously called black trout, but the name trout more correctly refers to certain members of the salmon family. The black bass are distributed throughout a large area east of the Rocky Mountains in North America, from the Hudson Bay basin in Canada to northeastern Mexico.  Several species, notably the Largemouth and Smallmouth basses, have been very widely introduced throughout the world, and are now considered cosmopolitan. 

Spotted bass<====>47346<====>Spotted bass The spotted bass (Micropterus punctulatus), also called spotty,   or spots in various fishing communities, is a species of freshwater fish of the sunfish family (Centrarchidae) of the order Perciformes.   One of the black basses, it is native to the Mississippi River basin and across the Gulf states, from central Texas through the Florida panhandle.   Its native range extends into the western Mid-Atlantic states and it has been introduced into western North Carolina and Virginia.   It has also been introduced to southern Africa, where it has become established in some isolated waters. 

Object (philosophy)<====>47353<====>Object (philosophy)  An object is a technical term in modern philosophy often used in contrast to the term subject.  A subject is an observer and an object is a thing observed.  For modern philosophers like Descartes, consciousness is a state of cognition that includes the subject—which can never be doubted as only it can be the one who doubts–—and some object(s) that may be considered as not having real or full existence or value independent of the subject who observes it.  Metaphysical frameworks also differ in whether they consider objects exist independently of their properties and, if so, in what way.

Titan (mythology)<====>47401<====>Titan (mythology)  In Greek mythology, the Titans (Greek:  , Titán,    , Titânes) and Titanesses (or Titanides; Greek:  , Titanís,    , Titanídes) were members of the second generation of divine beings, descending from the primordial deities and preceding the Olympians.  Based on Mount Othrys, the Titans most famously included the first twelve children of Gaia (Mother Earth) and Uranus (Father Sky).  They ruled during the legendary Golden Age, and also comprised the first pantheon of Greek deities. The first twelve Titans comprised the females Mnemosyne, Tethys, Theia, Phoebe, Rhea, and Themis and the males Oceanus, Hyperion, Coeus, Cronus, Crius, and Iapetus. 

Titan (moon)<====>47402<====>Titan (moon) Titan is the largest moon of Saturn.  It is the only moon known to have a dense atmosphere, and the only object in space other than Earth where clear evidence of stable bodies of surface liquid has been found. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 50% larger than Earth's Moon, and it is 80% more massive.  It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System, after Jupiter's moon Ganymede, and is larger than the smallest planet, Mercury, but only 40% as massive.  Discovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon of Saturn, and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's Moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter). 

Instrumentation<====>47403<====>Instrumentation Instrumentation is a collective term for measuring instruments used for indicating, measuring and recording physical quantities, and has its origins in the art and science of Scientific instrument-making.  The term instrumentation may refer to a device or group of devices used for direct reading thermometers or, when using many sensors, may become part of a complex Industrial control system in such as manufacturing industry, vehicles and transportation.  Instrumentation can be found in the household as well; a smoke detector or a heating thermostat are examples. History and developmentThe history of instrumentation can be divide into several phases. 

Anne of Cleves<====>47404<====>Anne of Cleves  Anne of Cleves ( ; 22 September 1515 – 16 July 1557)  was Queen of England from 6 January to 9 July 1540 as the fourth wife of King Henry VIII.   The marriage was declared never consummated and, as a result, she was not crowned queen consort.  Following the annulment, she was given a generous settlement by the King, and thereafter referred to as the King's Beloved Sister.    She lived to see the coronation of Queen Mary I, outliving the rest of Henry's wives.  Early lifeAnne was born on 22 September 1515   in Düsseldorf,  the second daughter of John III of the House of La Marck, Duke of Jülich jure uxoris, Cleves, Berg jure uxoris, Count of Mark, also known as de la Marck and Ravensberg jure uxoris (often referred to as Duke of Cleves) who died in 1538, and his wife Maria, Duchess of Julich-Berg (1491–1543). 

Catherine Parr<====>47406<====>Catherine Parr    Catherine Parr (alternatively spelled Katherine, Katheryn or Katharine, signed 'Katheryn the Quene KP') (    ) was Queen of England and of Ireland (1543–47) as the last of the six wives of King Henry VIII, and the final queen consort of the House of Tudor.   She married him on 12 July 1543, and outlived him by one year.   She was also the most-married English queen, with four husbands. Catherine enjoyed a close relationship with Henry's three children and was personally involved in the education of Elizabeth and Edward, both of whom became English monarchs. 

Gabriele D'Annunzio<====>47407<====>Gabriele D'Annunzio   General Gabriele D'Annunzio, Prince of Montenevoso, Duke of Gallese   ( ; 12 March 1863 – 1 March 1938), sometimes spelled d'Annunzio,  was an Italian writer, poet, journalist, playwright and soldier during World War I.  He occupied a prominent place in Italian literature from 1889 to 1910 and later political life from 1914 to 1924.  He was often referred to under the epithets  Il Vate ("the Poet")  or Il Profeta ("the Prophet"). D'Annunzio was associated with the Decadent movement in his literary works, which interplayed closely with French Symbolism and British Aestheticism.

Margaret of Anjou<====>47411<====>Margaret of Anjou    Margaret of Anjou ( ; 23 March 1430 – 25 August 1482) was the Queen of England by marriage to King Henry VI from 1445 to 1461 and again from 1470 to 1471.  Born in the Duchy of Lorraine into the House of Valois-Anjou, Margaret was the second eldest daughter of René, King of Naples, and Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine. She was one of the principal figures in the series of dynastic civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses and at times personally led the Lancastrian faction.  Owing to her husband's frequent bouts of insanity, Margaret ruled the kingdom in his place. 

Group psychotherapy<====>47418<====>Group psychotherapy  Group psychotherapy or group therapy is a form of psychotherapy in which one or more therapists treat a small group of clients together as a group.    The term can legitimately refer to any form of psychotherapy when delivered in a group format, including cognitive behavioural therapy or interpersonal therapy, but it is usually applied to psychodynamic group therapy where the group context and group process is explicitly utilised as a mechanism of change by developing, exploring and examining interpersonal relationships within the group. The broader concept of group therapy can be taken to include any helping process that takes place in a group, including support groups, skills training groups (such as anger management, mindfulness, relaxation training or social skills training), and psychoeducation groups. 

Convenience store<====>47419<====>Convenience store    A convenience store is a small retail business that stocks a range of everyday items such as groceries, snack foods, confectionery, soft drinks, tobacco products, over-the-counter drugs, toiletries, newspapers, and magazines.    In some jurisdictions, corner stores are licensed to sell alcohol, typically beer and wine.  Such stores may also offer money order and wire transfer services.  They differ from general stores and village shops in that they are not in a rural location and are used as a convenient supplement to larger stores. A convenience store may be part of a gas/petrol station, so customers can purchase goods conveniently while filling their vehicle with fuel. 

7-Eleven<====>47420<====>7-Eleven   7-Eleven is an American-Japanese international chain of convenience stores, headquartered in Irving, Texas, that operates, franchises, and licenses some 56,600 stores in 18 countries.   The chain was known as Tote'm Stores until renamed in 1946.  Its parent company, Seven-Eleven Japan Co. , Ltd. , is located in Chiyoda, Tokyo.   Seven-Eleven Japan is held by the Seven & I Holdings Co.    EtymologiesThe company's first outlets were named "Tote'm Stores" because customers "toted" away their purchases.  Some stores featured genuine Alaskan totem poles in front of the store.  In 1946, the chain's name was changed from "Tote'm" to "7-Eleven" to reflect the company's new, extended hours, 7:00 am to 11:00 pm, seven days per week.

Bungee jumping<====>47425<====>Bungee jumpingNot to be confused with reverse bungee. Bungee jumping ( ; also spelled "bungy" jumping, which is the usual spelling in New Zealand and several other countries) AJ Hackett (2008)Welcome to Cairns.  Retrieved on 17 October 2008.   is an activity that involves jumping from a tall structure while connected to a large elastic cord.  The tall structure is usually a fixed object, such as a building, bridge or crane; but it is also possible to jump from a movable object, such as a hot-air-balloon or helicopter, that has the ability to hover above the ground. 

Water polo<====>47426<====>Water polo   Water polo is a competitive team sport played in the water between two teams.  The game consists of four quarters, usually of eight minutes, in which the two teams attempt to score goals and throw the ball into their opponent's goal.  The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins the match.  Each team made up of six field players and one goalkeeper.  Except for the goalkeeper, players participate in both offensive and defensive roles.  Water polo is typically played in an all-deep pool seven feet (or two meters) deep. 

Atlas (moon)<====>47427<====>Atlas (moon) Atlas is an inner satellite of Saturn. Atlas was discovered by Richard Terrile in 1980 (some time before November 12) from Voyager photos and was designated  .   In 1983 it was officially named after Atlas of Greek mythology, because it "holds the rings on its shoulders" like the Titan Atlas held the sky up above the Earth.   It is also designated  . Atlas is the closest satellite to the sharp outer edge of the A ring, and was long thought to be a shepherd satellite for this ring.  However, now it is known that the outer edge of the ring is instead maintained by a 7:6 orbital resonance with the larger but more distant moons Janus and Epimetheus. 

Atlas (mythology)<====>47428<====>Atlas (mythology)  In Greek mythology, Atlas ( ;  ) was a Titan condemned to hold up the sky for eternity after the Titanomachy.  Although associated with  various places, he became commonly identified with the Atlas Mountains in  northwest Africa (modern-day Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia).   Atlas was the son of the Titan Iapetus and the Oceanid Asia  or Clymene.   He had many children, mostly daughters, the Hesperides, the Hyades, the Pleiades, and the nymph Calypso who lived on the island Ogygia.   According to the ancient Greek poet Hesiod, Atlas stood at the ends of the earth towards the west. 

Atlas<====>47429<====>Atlas  An atlas is a collection of maps; it is typically a bundle of maps of Earth or a region of Earth. Atlases have traditionally been bound into book form, but today many atlases are in multimedia formats.   In addition to presenting geographic features and political boundaries, many atlases often feature geopolitical, social, religious and economic statistics.  They also have information about the map and places in it. EtymologyThe use of the word atlas in a geographical context dates from 1595 when the geographer Gerardus Mercator published Atlas Sive Cosmographicae Meditationes de Fabrica Mundi et Fabricati Figura. 

Atlas (anatomy)<====>47430<====>Atlas (anatomy)  In anatomy, the atlas (C1) is the most superior (first) cervical vertebra of the spine. It is named for the Atlas of Greek mythology, because it supports the globe of the head.  The atlas is the topmost vertebra and with the axis forms the joint connecting the skull and spine.  The atlas and axis are specialized to allow a greater range of motion than normal vertebrae.  They are responsible for the nodding and rotation movements of the head. The atlanto-occipital joint allows the head to nod up and down on the vertebral column.  The dens acts as a pivot that allows the atlas and attached head to rotate on the axis, side to side. 

Atlas Mountains<====>47431<====>Atlas Mountains  The Atlas Mountains ( , jibāl al-ʾaṭlas;  , idurar n waṭlas) are a mountain range in the Maghreb.  It stretches around   through Morocco, Algeria  and Tunisia.  The range's highest peak is Toubkal, with an elevation of   in southwestern Morocco.  It separates the Mediterranean and Atlantic coastlines from the Sahara Desert.   The Atlas mountains are primarily inhabited by Berber populations.   The terms for 'mountain' in some Berber languages are adrar and adras, which are believed to be cognates of the toponym Atlas. The mountains are home to a number of plant and animal species unique in Africa, often more like those of Europe; many of them are endangered and some have already gone extinct. 

Atlas (architecture)<====>47433<====>Atlas (architecture)In classical European architecture, an atlas (also known as an atlant, or atlante   or atlantid; plural atlantes) Aru-Az  , Michael Delahunt, ArtLex Art Dictionary  , 1996–2008.   is a support sculpted in the form of a man, which may take the place of a column, a pier or a pilaster.  The Roman term for such a sculptural support is telamon (plural telamones or telamons).  The term atlantes is the Greek plural of the name Atlas – the Titan who was forced to hold the sky on his shoulders for eternity.  The alternative term, telamones, also is derived from a later mythological hero, Telamon, one of the Argonauts, who was the father of Ajax.

Atlas (topology)<====>47436<====>Atlas (topology) In mathematics, particularly topology, one describes a manifold using an atlas.  An atlas consists of individual charts that, roughly speaking, describe individual regions of the manifold.  If the manifold is the surface of the Earth, then an atlas has its more common meaning.  In general, the notion of atlas underlies the formal definition of a manifold and related structures such as vector bundles and other fibre bundles. Charts  The definition of an atlas depends on the notion of a chart.  A chart for a topological space M (also called a coordinate chart, coordinate patch, coordinate map, or local frame) is a homeomorphism  \varphi  from an open subset U of M to an open subset of a Euclidean space. 

Pope Paul III<====>47437<====>Pope Paul III   Pope Paul III ( ; 29 February 1468 – 10 November 1549), born Alessandro Farnese, was Pope from 13 October 1534 to his death in 1549. He came to the papal throne in an era following the sack of Rome in 1527 and rife with uncertainties in the Catholic Church following the Protestant Reformation.  During his pontificate, and in the spirit of the Counter-Reformation, new Catholic religious orders and societies, such as the Jesuits, the Barnabites, and the Congregation of the Oratory, attracted a popular following. He convened the Council of Trent in 1545.  He was a significant patron of the arts and employed nepotism to advance the power and fortunes of his family.

Early life and educationVera Ellen Wang was born and raised in New York City, and is of Chinese descent.  Her parents were born in China, and came to the United States in the mid-1940s.  Her mother, Florence Wu (Wu Chifang), worked as a translator for the United Nations, while her father, Cheng Ching Wang (Wang Chengqing), a graduate of Yanjing University and MIT, owned a medicine company.  Her maternal grandfather is Fengtian clique warlord Wu Junsheng, who was killed by the Empire of Japan in the Huanggutun incident in 1928. 

Copycat suicide<====>47444<====>Copycat suicideA copycat suicide is defined as an emulation of another suicide that the person attempting suicide knows about either from local knowledge or due to accounts or depictions of the original suicide on television and in other media. A spike of emulation suicides after a widely publicized suicide is known as the Werther effect, following Goethe's novel The Sorrows of Young Werther.    The publicized suicide serves as a trigger, in the absence of protective factors, for the next suicide by a susceptible or suggestible person.  This is referred to as suicide contagion.They occasionally spread through a school system, through a community, or in terms of a celebrity suicide wave, nationally. 

Chessboard<====>47449<====>Chessboard  A chessboard is the type of checkerboard used in the board game chess, consisting of 64 squares (eight rows and eight columns).  The squares are arranged in two alternating colors (light and dark).  Wooden boards may use naturally light and dark brown woods, while plastic and vinyl boards often use brown or green for the dark squares and shades such as buff or cream for the light squares.  Materials vary widely; while wooden boards are generally used in high-level games; vinyl, plastic, and cardboard are common for low-level and informal play.  Decorative glass and marble boards are available but rarely accepted for games rated by national or international chess federations. 

Stratosphere<====>47454<====>Stratosphere  The stratosphere (   ) is the second major layer of Earth's atmosphere, just above the troposphere, and below the mesosphere.  About 20% of the atmosphere's mass is contained in the stratosphere.  The stratosphere is stratified in temperature, with warmer layers higher and cooler layers closer to the Earth.  The increase of temperature with altitude is a result of the absorption of the Sun's ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer.  This is in contrast to the troposphere, near the Earth's surface, where temperature decreases with altitude.  The border between the troposphere and stratosphere, the tropopause, marks where this temperature inversion begins. 

James T. Kirk<====>47459<====>James T.  Kirk   James Tiberius "Jim" Kirk is a fictional character in the Star Trek franchise.  Kirk first appears in Star Trek: The Original Series and has been portrayed in numerous films, books, comics, webisodes, and video games.  As the captain of the starship USS Enterprise, Kirk leads his crew as they explore "new worlds, where no man has gone before".  Often, the characters of Spock and Leonard McCoy act as his logical and emotional sounding boards, respectively. Kirk, played by William Shatner, first appears in the broadcast pilot episode, "The Man Trap", originally broadcast on September 8, 1966. 

Mesosphere<====>47460<====>Mesosphere  The mesosphere ( ; from Greek mesos "middle" and sphaira "sphere") is the layer of the Earth's atmosphere that is directly above the stratosphere and directly below the mesopause.  In the mesosphere, temperature decreases as the altitude increases.  The upper boundary of the mesosphere is the mesopause, which can be the coldest naturally occurring place on Earth  with temperatures below  .  The exact upper and lower boundaries of the mesosphere vary with latitude and with season, but the lower boundary of the mesosphere is usually located at heights of about   above the Earth's surface and the mesopause is usually at heights near  ,  except at middle and high latitudes in summer where it descends to heights of about  . 

Thermosphere<====>47463<====>ThermosphereThe thermosphere is the layer of the Earth's atmosphere directly above the mesosphere.  The exosphere is above that but is a minor layer of the atmosphere.  Within this layer of the atmosphere, ultraviolet radiation causes photoionization/photodissociation of molecules, creating ions in the ionosphere.  Taking its name from the Greek θερμός (pronounced thermos) meaning heat, the thermosphere begins about   above the Earth.   At these high altitudes, the residual atmospheric gases sort into strata according to molecular mass (see turbosphere).  Thermospheric temperatures increase with altitude due to absorption of highly energetic solar radiation.  Temperatures are highly dependent on solar activity, and can rise to  . 

Aten<====>47465<====>Aten Aten (also Aton, Egyptian  ) is the disk of the sun in ancient Egyptian mythology, and originally an aspect of the god Ra.  The deified Aten is the focus of the religion of Atenism established by Amenhotep IV, who later took the name Akhenaten (died ca.  1335 BCE) in worship and recognition of Aten.  In his poem "Great Hymn to the Aten", Akhenaten praises Aten as the creator, giver of life, and nurturing spirit of the world.  Aten does not have a Creation Myth or family but is mentioned in the Book of the Dead. 

Mesopause<====>47466<====>Mesopause  The mesopause is the temperature minimum at the boundary between the mesosphere and the thermosphere atmospheric regions.  Due to the lack of solar heating and very strong radiative cooling from carbon dioxide, the mesosphere is the coldest region on Earth with temperatures as low as -100 °C (-148 °F or 173 K).   The altitude of the mesopause for many years was assumed to be at around 85 km (53 mi. ), but observations to higher altitudes and modeling studies in the last 10 years have shown that in fact the mesopause consists of two minima - one at about 85 km and a stronger minimum at about 100 km (62 mi).

Apollo asteroid<====>47470<====>Apollo asteroidThe Apollo asteroids are a group of near-Earth asteroids named after 1862 Apollo, discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth in the 1930s.  They are Earth crossing asteroids that have an orbital semi-major axis greater than that of the Earth (> 1 AU) but perihelion distances less than the Earth's aphelion distance (q    , the steadily growing number of known Apollo asteroids has reached a total of 8,180 members.  It is by far the largest group of near-Earth objects, compared to the Aten, Amor and Atira asteroids.   Currently, there are 1,133 numbered Apollos. 

Algal bloom<====>47473<====>Algal bloom An algal bloom is a rapid increase or accumulation in the population of algae in freshwater or marine water systems, and is recognized by the discoloration in the water from their pigments.   Cyanobacteria were mistaken for algae in the past, so cyanobacterial blooms are sometimes also called algal blooms.  Blooms which can injure animals or the ecology are called "harmful algal blooms" (HAB), and can lead to fish die-offs, cities cutting off water to residents, or states having to close fisheries. BloomingSince 'algae' is a broad term including organisms of widely varying sizes, growth rates and nutrient requirements, there is no officially recognized threshold level as to what is defined as a bloom. 

Aperture<====>47474<====>Aperture  In optics, an aperture is a hole or an opening through which light travels.   More specifically, the aperture and focal length of an optical system determine the cone angle of a bundle of rays that come to a focus in the image plane.  The aperture determines how collimated the admitted rays are, which is of great importance for the appearance at the image plane.    If an aperture is narrow, then highly collimated rays are admitted, resulting in a sharp focus at the image plane.   A wide aperture admits uncollimated rays, resulting in a sharp focus only for rays coming from a certain distance. 

Altimeter<====>47476<====>AltimeterAn altimeter or an altitude meter is an instrument used to measure the altitude of an object above a fixed level.  The measurement of altitude is called altimetry, which is related to the term bathymetry, the measurement of depth under water. Pressure altimeterAltitude can be determined based on the measurement of atmospheric pressure.  The greater the altitude, the lower the pressure.  When a barometer is supplied with a nonlinear calibration so as to indicate altitude, the instrument is called a pressure altimeter or barometric altimeter.  A pressure altimeter is the altimeter found in most aircraft, and skydivers use wrist-mounted versions for similar purposes. 

Ames Research Center<====>47477<====>Ames Research Center  Ames Research Center (ARC), also known as NASA Ames, is a major NASA research center at Moffett Federal Airfield in California's Silicon Valley.  It was founded as the second National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) laboratory.  That agency was dissolved and its assets and personnel transferred to the newly created National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on October 1, 1958.  NASA Ames is named in honor of Joseph Sweetman Ames, a physicist and one of the founding members of NACA.  At last estimate NASA Ames has over US$3. 0 billion in capital equipment, 2,300 research personnel and a US$860 million annual budget. 

Aquifer<====>47481<====>AquiferAn aquifer is an underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock, rock fractures or unconsolidated materials (gravel, sand, or silt) from which groundwater can be extracted using a water well.  The study of water flow in aquifers and the characterization of aquifers is called hydrogeology.  Related terms include aquitard, which is a bed of low permeability along an aquifer,  and aquiclude (or aquifuge), which is a solid, impermeable area underlying or overlying an aquifer.  If the impermeable area overlies the aquifer, pressure could cause it to become a confined aquifer. DepthAquifers may occur at various depths.  Those closer to the surface are not only more likely to be used for water supply and irrigation, but are also more likely to be topped up by the local rainfall. 

Atmospheric pressure<====>47484<====>Atmospheric pressure Atmospheric pressure, sometimes also called barometric pressure, is the pressure within the atmosphere of Earth (or that of another planet).  In most circumstances atmospheric pressure is closely approximated by the hydrostatic pressure caused by the weight of air above the measurement point.  As elevation increases, there is less overlying atmospheric mass, so that atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation.  Pressure measures force per unit area, with SI units of Pascals (1 pascal = 1 newton per square metre, 1 N/m 2 ).  On average, a column of air with a cross-sectional area of 1 square centimetre (cm 2 ), measured from mean (average) sea level to the top of Earth's atmosphere, has a mass of about 1. 

King (chess)<====>47485<====>King (chess) In chess, the king (♔,♚) is the most important piece.  The object of the game is to threaten the opponent's king in such a way that escape is not possible (checkmate).  If a player's king is threatened with capture, it is said to be in check, and the player must remove the threat of   on the next move.  If this cannot be done, the king is said to be in checkmate, resulting in a loss for that player.  Although the king is the most important piece, it is usually the weakest piece in the game until a later phase, the endgame. 

Atoll<====>47486<====>Atoll An atoll ( ,  ,  ,  ,   or  ),   sometimes called a coral atoll, is a ring-shaped coral reef including a coral rim that encircles a lagoon partially or completely.  There may be coral islands or cays on the rim.  The coral of the atoll often sits atop the rim of an extinct seamount or volcano which has eroded or subsided partially beneath the water.  The lagoon forms over the volcanic crater or caldera while the higher rim remains above water or at shallow depths that permit the coral to grow and form the reefs. 

Azimuth<====>47487<====>Azimuth An azimuth ( ) (from the pl.  form of the Arabic noun "السَّمْت" as-samt, meaning "the direction") is an angular measurement in a spherical coordinate system.  The vector from an observer (origin) to a point of interest is projected perpendicularly onto a reference plane; the angle between the projected vector and a reference vector on the reference plane is called the azimuth. An example of azimuth is the angular direction of a star in the sky.  The star is the point of interest, the reference plane is the local horizontal area (e. g.  a circular area 5 km in radius around an observer at sea level), and the reference vector points north. 

Barometer<====>47488<====>BarometerA barometer is a scientific instrument used in meteorology to measure atmospheric pressure.  Pressure tendency can forecast short term changes in the weather.  Numerous measurements of air pressure are used within surface weather analysis to help find surface troughs, high pressure systems and frontal boundaries. Barometers and pressure altimeters (the most basic and common type of altimeter) are essentially the same instrument, but used for different purposes.  An altimeter is intended to be transported from place to place matching the atmospheric pressure to the corresponding altitude, while a barometer is kept stationary and measures subtle pressure changes caused by weather. 

Biodegradation<====>47490<====>Biodegradation Biodegradation is the disintegration of materials by bacteria, fungi, or other biological means.  The term is often used in relation to: biomedicine, waste management, ecology, and the bioremediation of the natural environment.  It is now commonly associated with environmentally-friendly products, capable of decomposing back into natural elements. Although often conflated, biodegradable is distinct in meaning from: compostable.  While biodegradable simply means can be consumed by microorganisms, compostable makes the further specific demand that the object break down under composting conditions. Organic material can be degraded aerobically (with oxygen) or anaerobically (without oxygen).  Decomposition of biodegradable substances may include both biological and abiotic steps. 

Biomass (ecology)<====>47492<====>Biomass (ecology)  Biomass is the mass of living biological organisms in a given area or ecosystem at a given time.  Biomass can refer to species biomass, which is the mass of one or more species, or to community biomass, which is the mass of all species in the community.  It can include microorganisms, plants or animals.   The mass can be expressed as the average mass per unit area, or as the total mass in the community. How biomass is measured depends on why it is being measured.  Sometimes, the biomass is regarded as the natural mass of organisms in situ, just as they are. 

Doctor Doom<====>47497<====>Doctor Doom  Dr.  Victor Von Doom (commonly known as Doctor Doom, or simply Doom) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.  The son of a Romani witch, Von Doom has been depicted as a supervillain, the archenemy of the Fantastic Four, and the leader of the fictional nation Latveria.  He is both a genius inventor and a sorcerer.  While his chief opponents have been the Fantastic Four, he has also come into conflict with Iron Man, Black Panther, and multiple others.  Von Doom has also been depicted as a superhero, being the third character to take up the mantle of Iron Man  and joining the Avengers. 

All your base are belong to us<====>47498<====>All your base are belong to us "All your base are belong to us" is a popular Internet meme based on a broken English ("Engrish") phrase found in the opening cutscene of the 1992 Mega Drive port of the 1989 arcade video game Zero Wing.  The quote comes from the European release of the game, featuring poor English translations of the original Japanese version.

Brightness temperature<====>47501<====>Brightness temperature Brightness temperature is the temperature a black body in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings would have to be to duplicate the observed intensity of a grey body object at a frequency  \nu .  This concept is extensively used in radio astronomy and planetary science. The brightness temperature is not a temperature as ordinarily understood.  It characterizes radiation, and depending on the mechanism of radiation can differ considerably from the physical temperature of a radiating body (though it is theoretically possible to construct a device which will heat up by a source of radiation with some brightness temperature to the actual temperature equal to brightness temperature). 

Calibration<====>47502<====>Calibration Calibration in measurement technology and metrology is the comparison of measurement values delivered by a device under test with those of a calibration standard of known accuracy.  Such a standard could be another measurement device of known accuracy, a device generating the quantity to be measured such as a voltage, or a physical artefact, such as a metre ruler. The outcome of the comparison can result in no significant error being noted on the device under test, a significant error being noted but no adjustment made, or an adjustment made to correct the error to an acceptable level. 

Carbon cycle<====>47503<====>Carbon cycle  The carbon cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth.  Carbon is the main component of biological compounds as well as a major component of many minerals such as limestone.  Along with the nitrogen cycle and the water cycle, the carbon cycle comprises a sequence of events that are key to make Earth capable of sustaining life.  It describes the movement of carbon as it is recycled and reused throughout the biosphere, as well as long-term processes of carbon sequestration to and release from carbon sinks. 

Queen (chess)<====>47505<====>Queen (chess) The queen (♕,♛) is the most powerful piece in the game of chess, able to move any number of squares vertically, horizontally or diagonally.  Each player starts the game with one queen, placed in the middle of the first   next to the king.  With the chessboard oriented correctly, the white queen starts on a white square and the black queen starts on a black square.  (Thus the mnemonics "queen gets her color", "queen on [her] [own] color", or "the dress [queen piece] matches the shoes [square]" (Latin: servat rēgīna colōrem). ) In algebraic notation, the white queen starts on d1, while the black queen starts on d8.

Cirrus cloud<====>47510<====>Cirrus cloud Cirrus (cloud classification symbol: Ci) is a genus of atmospheric cloud generally characterized by thin, wispy strands, giving the type its name from the Latin word cirrus, meaning a ringlet or curling lock of hair. This cloud can form at any altitude between   and   above sea level.  The strands of cloud sometimes appear in tufts of a distinctive form referred to by the common name of "mares' tails".    On planet Earth, cirrus generally appears white or light gray in color.  It forms when water vapor undergoes deposition at altitudes above   in temperate regions and above   in tropical regions. 

Climate change<====>47512<====>Climate changeClimate change is a change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when that change lasts for an extended period of time (i. e. , decades to millions of years).   Climate change may refer to a change in average weather conditions, or in the time variation of weather within the context of longer-term average conditions.  Climate change is caused by factors such as   processes, variations in solar radiation received by Earth, plate tectonics, and volcanic eruptions.  Certain human activities have been identified as primary causes of ongoing climate change, often referred to as global warming. 

Climate model<====>47513<====>Climate model  Climate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the important drivers of climate, including atmosphere, oceans, land surface and ice.  They are used for a variety of purposes from study of the dynamics of the climate system to projections of future climate. All climate models take account of incoming energy from the sun as short wave electromagnetic radiation, chiefly visible and short-wave (near) infrared, as well as outgoing long wave (far) infrared electromagnetic.  Any imbalance results in a change in temperature. Models vary in complexity:A simple radiant heat transfer model treats the earth as a single point and averages outgoing energyThis can be expanded vertically (radiative-convective models) and/or horizontallyFinally, (coupled) atmosphere–ocean–sea ice global climate models solve the full equations for mass and energy transfer and radiant exchange. 

Cloud albedo<====>47514<====>Cloud albedo What is cloud albedo?Cloud albedo is a measure of the albedo of a cloud.  Higher values indicate that a cloud reflects a larger amount of solar radiation and transmits a smaller amount of radiation.   Cloud albedo depends on the total mass of water, the size and shape of the droplets or particles and their distribution in space.Cloud albedo, along with the greenhouse effect of clouds, strongly influence the Earth's energy budget.    Thick clouds (such as stratocumulus) reflect a large amount of incoming solar radiation, meaning they have a high albedo. 

Cloud<====>47515<====>Cloud   In meteorology, a cloud is an aerosol comprising a visible mass of minute liquid droplets, frozen crystals, or particles suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body.   The droplets and crystals may be made of water or various chemicals.   On Earth, clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew point, or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of water vapor) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature.   They are seen in the Earth's homosphere (which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere). 

Planetary body<====>47517<====>Planetary body  A planetary body or planetary object is any secondary body in the Solar System  that is geologically differentiated or in hydrostatic equilibrium and thus has a planet-like geology: a planet, dwarf planet, or the larger moons and asteroids. In 2002, planetary scientists Alan Stern and Harold Levison proposed the following algorithm to determine whether an object in space satisfies the definition for a planetary body.   The body must:Be low enough in mass that at no time (past or present) can it generate energy in its interior due to any self-sustaining nuclear fusion chain reaction. 

Cloud feedback<====>47518<====>Cloud feedbackCloud feedback is the coupling between cloudiness and surface air temperature where a surface air temperature change leads to a change in clouds, which could then amplify or diminish the initial temperature perturbation.  Cloud feedbacks can affect the magnitude of internally generated climate variability   or they can affect the magnitude of climate change resulting from external radiative forcing s.  Global warming is expected to change the distribution and type of clouds.Seen from below, clouds emit infrared radiation back to the surface, and so exert a warming effect; seen from above, clouds reflect sunlight and emit infrared radiation to space, and so exert a cooling effect. 

Cloud forcing<====>47519<====>Cloud forcingCloud forcing (sometimes described as cloud radiative forcing or cloud radiative effect) is, in meteorology, the difference between the radiation budget components for average cloud conditions and cloud-free conditions.   Much of the interest in cloud forcing relates to its role as a feedback process in the present period of global warming.  Measuring Cloud ForcingThe following equation calculates this change in the radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere    \Delta R_{TOA} = R_{Average} - R_{Clear}  The net cloud radiative effect can be decomposed into its longwave and shortwave components.  This is because net radiation is absorbed solar minus the outgoing longwave radiation shown by the following equations  \Delta R_{TOA} = \Delta Q_{abs} - \Delta OLR  The first term on the right is the shortwave cloud effect (Q abs  ) and the second is the longwave effect (OLR). 

Coccolithophore<====>47520<====>Coccolithophore A coccolithophore (or coccolithophorid, from the adjective ) is a unicellular, eukaryotic phytoplankton (alga).  They belong either to the kingdom Protista, according to Robert Whittaker's Five kingdom classification, or clade Hacrobia, according to the newer biological classification system.  Within the Hacrobia, the coccolithophorids are in the phylum or division Haptophyta, class Prymnesiophyceae (or Coccolithophyceae).   .   Coccolithophorids are distinguished by special calcium carbonate plates (or scales) of uncertain function called coccoliths, which are also important microfossils.  However, there are Prymnesiophyceae species lacking coccoliths (e. g.  in genus Prymnesium), so not every member of Prymnesiophyceae is coccolithophorid. 

Condensation<====>47521<====>Condensation Condensation is the change of the physical state of matter from gas phase into liquid phase, and is the reverse of vapourisation.  The word most often refers to the water cycle.It can also be defined as the change in the state of water vapour to liquid water when in contact with a liquid or solid surface or cloud condensation nuclei within the atmosphere.  When the transition happens from the gaseous phase into the solid phase directly, the change is called deposition (or desublimation, see Sublimation (phase transition). InitiationCondensation is initiated by the formation of atomic/molecular clusters of that species within its gaseous volume—like rain drop or snow flake formation within clouds—or at the contact between such gaseous phase and a liquid or solid surface. 

Conifer<====>47523<====>Conifer

Contrail<====>47525<====>Contrail    Contrails ( ; short for "condensation trails") are line-shaped clouds  produced by aircraft engine exhaust or changes in air pressure, typically at aircraft cruise altitudes several miles above the Earth's surface.  Contrails are composed primarily of water, in the form of ice crystals.  The combination of water vapor in aircraft engine exhaust and the low ambient temperatures that exist at high altitudes allows the formation of the trails.  Impurities in the engine exhaust from the fuel, including sulfur compounds (0. 05% by weight in jet fuel) provide some of the particles that can serve as sites for water droplet growth in the exhaust and, if water droplets form, they might freeze to form ice particles that compose a contrail. 

Convection<====>47526<====>ConvectionConvection is the heat transfer due to bulk movement of molecules within fluids such as gases and liquids, including molten rock (rheid).  Convection takes place through advection, diffusion or both. Convection cannot take place in most solids because neither bulk current flows nor significant diffusion of matter can take place.  Diffusion of heat takes place in rigid solids, but that is called heat conduction.  Convection, however, can take place in soft solids or mixtures where solid particles can move past each other. Thermal convection can be demonstrated by placing a heat source (e. g.  a Bunsen burner) at the side of a glass full of a liquid, and observing the changes in temperature in the glass caused by the warmer ghost fluid circulating into cooler areas. 

Cryosphere<====>47527<====>Cryosphere The cryosphere (from the Greek   kryos, "cold", "frost" or "ice" and   sphaira, "globe, ball" ) is those portions of Earth's surface where water is in solid form, including sea ice, lake ice, river ice, snow cover, glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets, and frozen ground (which includes permafrost).  Thus, there is a wide overlap with the hydrosphere.  The cryosphere is an integral part of the global climate system with important linkages and feedbacks generated through its influence on surface energy and moisture fluxes, clouds, precipitation, hydrology, atmospheric and oceanic circulation.  Through these feedback processes, the cryosphere plays a significant role in the global climate and in climate model response to global changes. 

Cumulonimbus cloud<====>47530<====>Cumulonimbus cloud Cumulonimbus, from the Latin cumulus ("heaped") and nimbus ("rainstorm"), is a dense, towering vertical cloud    associated with thunderstorms and atmospheric instability, forming from water vapor carried by powerful upward air currents.  If observed during a storm, these clouds may be referred to as thunderheads.  Cumulonimbus can form alone, in clusters, or along cold front squall lines.  These clouds are capable of producing lightning and other dangerous severe weather, such as tornadoes.  Cumulonimbus progress from overdeveloped cumulus congestus clouds and may further develop as part of a supercell.    Cumulonimbus is abbreviated Cb. 

Cumulus cloud<====>47532<====>Cumulus cloud  Cumulus clouds are clouds which have flat bases and are often described as "puffy", "cotton-like" or "fluffy" in appearance.  Their name derives from the Latin cumulo-, meaning heap or pile.   Cumulus clouds are low-level clouds, generally less than 2,000 m (6,600 ft) in altitude unless they are the more vertical cumulus congestus form.  Cumulus clouds may appear by themselves, in lines, or in clusters. Cumulus clouds are often precursors of other types of clouds, such as cumulonimbus, when influenced by weather factors such as instability, moisture, and temperature gradient.  Normally, cumulus clouds produce little or no precipitation, but they can grow into the precipitation-bearing congestus or cumulonimbus clouds. 

Haptophyte<====>47535<====>Haptophyte The haptophytes, classified either as the Haptophyta, Haptophytina or Prymnesiophyta (named for Prymnesium), are a clade of algae. The names Haptophyceae or Prymnesiophyceae are sometimes used instead.    This ending implies classification at the class rank rather than as a division.  Although the phylogenetics of this group has become much better understood in recent years, there remains some dispute over which rank is most appropriate. CharacteristicsThe chloroplasts are pigmented similarly to those of the heterokonts,  but the structure of the rest of the cell is different, so it may be that they are a separate line whose chloroplasts are derived from similar red algal endosymbionts. 

United Nations Security Council Resolution 242<====>47541<====>United Nations Security Council Resolution 242  United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 (S/RES/242) was adopted unanimously by the UN Security Council on November 22, 1967, in the aftermath of the Six-Day War.  It was adopted under Chapter VI of the UN Charter.The resolution was sponsored by British ambassador Lord Caradon and was one of five drafts under consideration.  The preamblerefers to the "inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East in which every State in the area can live in security". 

Buffy the Vampire Slayer<====>47542<====>Buffy the Vampire SlayerBuffy the Vampire Slayer  is   an American supernatural drama television series created by Joss Whedon under his production tag, Mutant Enemy Productions, with later co-executive producers being Jane Espenson, David Fury, David Greenwalt, Doug Petrie, Marti Noxon, and David Solomon.  The series premiered on March 10, 1997, on The WB and concluded on May 20, 2003, on UPN.  The series narrative follows Buffy Summers (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar), the latest in a line of young women known as "Vampire Slayers", or simply "Slayers".  In the story, Slayers are "called" (chosen by fate) to battle against vampires, demons, and other forces of darkness. 

Zero Wing<====>47543<====>Zero Wing    is a 1989 side-scrolling shoot 'em up arcade game developed by Toaplan and published by Taito.  The player is a lone hero who will save the universe from an evil force. It enjoyed a degree of success in arcades and was subsequently ported to the Mega Drive by Toaplan on May 31, 1991, in Japan, and by Sega during the following year in Europe, followed by a Japan-only release by Naxat Soft on September 18, 1992, for the PC Engine's CD-ROM². The European version of the Mega Drive port was the source for "All your base are belong to us", an Internet meme which plays off the poorly translated English in the game's introduction. 

Carrying capacity<====>47544<====>Carrying capacityThe carrying capacity of a biological species in an environment is the maximum population size of the species that the environment can sustain indefinitely, given the food, habitat, water, and other necessities available in the environment.  In population biology, carrying capacity is defined as the environment's maximal load,  which is different from the concept of population equilibrium.  Its effect on population dynamics may be approximated in a logistic model, although this simplification ignores the possibility of overshoot which real systems may exhibit. Carrying capacity was originally used to determine the number of animals that could graze on a segment of land without destroying it. 

Vardar Macedonia<====>47546<====>Vardar MacedoniaVardar Macedonia (Macedonian and  , Vardarska Makedonija) was the name of a territory in the Kingdom of Serbia and Kingdom of Yugoslavia roughly corresponding to today's Republic of Macedonia (northwestern part of geographical Macedonia).  It usually refers to the part of the Macedonia region attributed to the Kingdom of Serbia by the Treaty of Bucharest (1913).  It is named after the Vardar, the major river in the area.  Officially, the area was called Southern Serbia ( , Južna Srbija),    later Vardar Banovina, because the very name Macedonia was prohibited in Serbia, later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. 

Daylight saving time<====>47548<====>Daylight saving time Daylight saving time (abbreviated DST), commonly referred to as daylight savings time in speech,  and known as summer time in some countries, is the practice of advancing clocks during summer months so that evening daylight lasts longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times.  Typically, regions that use daylight saving time adjust clocks forward one hour close to the start of spring and adjust them backward in the autumn to standard time.  George Hudson proposed the idea of daylight saving in 1895.   The German Empire and Austria-Hungary organized the first nationwide implementation, starting on April 30, 1916. 

Let's roll<====>47552<====>Let's roll  "Let's roll" is a colloquialism that has been used extensively as a command to move and start an activity, attack, mission or project. OriginsThe phrase has been used as early as 1908 in the cadence song now called "The Army Goes Rolling Along", which likely extended into tank usage.  "The Roads Must Roll", a science fiction story written in 1940 by Robert A.  Heinlein, mentions a re-worded version of "The Roll of the Caissons" called "Road Songs of the Transport Cadets".  The protagonist of the 1937 supernatural comedy, Topper, played by Cary Grant, uses the phrase "Let's roll" to his wife, played by Constance Bennett, to indicate they should immediately exit their friend's stuffy office and find a drink. 

Idiom<====>47563<====>Idiom  An idiom ( , "special property", from  , "special feature, special phrasing, a peculiarity", f.   , "one's own") is a phrase or an expression that has a figurative, or sometimes literal, meaning.  Categorized as formulaic language, an idiom's figurative meaning is different from the literal meaning.   There are thousands of idioms, occurring frequently in all languages.  It is estimated that there are at least twenty-five thousand idiomatic expressions in the English language.  DerivationsMany idiomatic expressions, in their original use, were not figurative but had literal meaning.  Also, sometimes the attribution of a literal meaning can change as the phrase becomes disconnected from its original roots, leading to a folk etymology. 

Squalius cephalus<====>47565<====>Squalius cephalusFor European chubs other than this particular species, see Squalius.  Squalius cephalus   is a European species of freshwater fish in the carp family Cyprinidae.  It frequents both slow and moderate rivers, as well as canals and still waters of various kinds.  his species is referred to as the common chub, European chub, or simply chub.  DescriptionIt is a stocky fish with a large rounded head.  Its bosy is long and cylindrical in shape and is covered large greenish-brown scales which are edged with narrow bands of black across the back paling to golden on the flanks and even plare on the belly. 

Low Earth orbit<====>47568<====>Low Earth orbit A low Earth orbit (LEO) is an orbit around Earth with an altitude of   or less, and with an orbital period of between about 84 and 127 minutes.  Objects below approximately   will experience very rapid orbital decay and altitude loss due to atmospheric drag.   With the exception of the 24 astronauts who flew lunar flights in the Apollo program during the four-year period spanning 1968 through 1972, all human spaceflights have taken place in LEO or below.  The International Space Station conducts operations in LEO.  The altitude record for a human spaceflight in LEO was Gemini 11 with an apogee of  . 

Appian Way<====>47569<====>Appian Way  The Appian Way (Latin and Italian: Via Appia) was one of the earliest and strategically most important Roman roads of the ancient republic.  It connected Rome to Brindisi, in southeast Italy.   Its importance is indicated by its common name, recorded by Statius:  Appia longarum. . .   regina viarum"the Appian Way the queen of the long roads"The road is named after Appius Claudius Caecus, the Roman censor who began and completed the first section as a military road to the south in 312 BC "Appian Way" in Chambers's Encyclopædia.  London: George Newnes, 1961, Vol. 

American pickerel<====>47571<====>American pickerel  The American pickerels are two subspecies of Esox americanus, a species of freshwater fish in the pike family (family Esocidae) of order Esociformes: the redfin pickerel, E.  americanus americanus Gmelin, 1789, and the grass pickerel, E.  americanus vermiculatus Lesueur, 1846. Both subspecies are native to North America.  They are not to be confused with their aggressive counterpart the Northern pike.  The redfin pickerel's range extends from the Saint Lawrence drainage in Quebec down to the Gulf Coast, from Mississippi to Florida, while the grass pickerel's range is further west, extending from the Great Lakes Basin, from Ontario to Michigan, down to the western Gulf Coast, from eastern Texas to Mississippi. 

Redfish<====>47572<====>Redfish   Redfish is a common name for several species of fish. It is most commonly applied to certain deep-sea rockfish in the genus Sebastes, or the reef dwelling snappers in the genus Lutjanus. It is also applied to the slimeheads or roughies (family Trachichthyidae), and the alfonsinos (Berycidae).Species known as "Redfish"Country Species Other common names Australia, UK Centroberyx affinis Redfish, eastern nannygai Australia Lutjanus erythropterus Crimson snapper Australia Lutjanus malabaricus Malabar blood snapper Australia Lutjanus sebae Emperor red snapper Barbados Etelis oculatus Queen snapper Canada Sebastes mentella Deep-water redfish Trinidad and Tobago Lutjanus buccanella Blackfin snapper Trinidad and Tobago Lutjanus purpureus Southern red snapper Trinidad and Tobago Lutjanus synagris Lane snapper Trinidad and Tobago Rhomboplites aurorubens Vermillion snapper UK Oncorhynchus nerka Sockeye salmon UK/USA Sebastes fasciatus Acadian redfish USA Lutjanus campechanus Red snapper USA Sciaenops ocellatus Red drum USA Sebastes norvegicus Ocean perch USA Sebastes viviparus Norway redfish  

Porgy (novel)<====>47574<====>Porgy (novel)  Porgy is a novel written by the American author DuBose Heyward and published by the George H.  Doran Company in 1925. The novel tells the story of Porgy, a crippled street-beggar living in the black tenements of Charleston, South Carolina, in the 1920s.  The character was based on Charlestonian Samuel Smalls.   In some of the novel's passages, black characters speak in Gullah, a creole language that had developed among enslaved African Americans during the slavery years on the Sea Islands. The novel was adapted for a 1927 play of the same name by Heyward and his wife, playwright Dorothy Heyward. 

Weakfish<====>47575<====>Weakfish The weakfish, Cynoscion regalis, is a marine fish of the drum family Sciaenidae. A medium-large, slender, marine fish, it is found along the east coast of North America.  The head and back of this fish are dark brown in color with a greenish tinge.   The sides have a faint silvery hue with dusky specks, and the belly is white.   The origin of its name is based on the weakness of the mouth muscles, which often cause a hook to tear free, allowing the fish to escape.   The weakfish grows to 1 m (3 feet) in length and 9 kg (20 pounds) in weight. 

Striped bass<====>47576<====>Striped bass   The striped bass (Morone saxatilis), also called Atlantic striped bass, striper, linesider, rock, or rockfish, is an anadromous Perciforme fish of the family Moronidae found primarily along the Atlantic coast of North America.  It has also been widely introduced into inland recreational fisheries across the United States.   Striped bass found in the Gulf of Mexico are a separate strain referred to as Gulf Coast striped bass.  The striped bass is the state fish of Maryland, Rhode Island, and South Carolina, and the state saltwater (marine) fish of New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and New Hampshire. 

Muskellunge<====>47578<====>Muskellunge  The muskellunge (Esox masquinongy), also known as muskelunge, muscallonge, milliganong, or maskinonge (and often abbreviated "muskie" or "musky"), is a species of large, relatively uncommon freshwater fish native to North America.  The muskellunge is the largest member of the pike family, Esocidae.  The common name comes from the Ojibwa word maashkinoozhe, meaning "ugly pike", by way of French masque allongé (modified from the Ojibwa word by folk etymology), "elongated face. "  The French common name is masquinongé or maskinongé. The muskellunge is known by a wide variety of trivial names including Ohio muskellunge, Great Lakes muskellunge, barred muskellunge, Ohio River pike, Allegheny River pike, jack pike, unspotted muskellunge and the Wisconsin muskellunge. 

Pollock<====>47579<====>Pollock  Pollock (pronounced  ) is the common name used for either of the two species of North Atlantic marine fish in the genus Pollachius.  Pollachius pollachius is referred to as pollock in both North America and the United Kingdom, while Pollachius virens today is usually known as coley in the British Isles (derived from the older name coalfish).   Other names for P.  pollachius include the Atlantic pollock, European pollock, lieu jaune, and lythe; while P.  virens is also known as Boston blue (distinct from bluefish), silver bill, or saithe.

Fort Montgomery (Hudson River)<====>47586<====>Fort Montgomery (Hudson River) Fort Montgomery is a fortification built in 1776 by the Continental Army on West Bank of the Hudson River during the American Revolution.  It is part of the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area.  Fort Montgomery was one of the first major investments by the Americans in strategic construction projects.  Declared a National Historic Landmark, it is owned and operated by the state of New York as the Fort Montgomery State Historic Site. BackgroundThe strategic importance of the ability to control navigation along the Hudson River was obvious to both the Americans and the British from the outbreak of open hostilities. 

Neurosis<====>47588<====>Neurosis   Neurosis is a class of functional mental disorders involving chronic distress but neither delusions nor hallucinations.  The term is no longer used by the professional psychiatric community in the United States, having been eliminated from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1980 with the publication of DSM III.  It is still used in the ICD-10 Chapter V F40–48. Neurosis should not be mistaken for psychosis, which refers to a loss of touch with reality.  Neither should it be mistaken for neuroticism, a fundamental personality trait proposed in the big Five personality traits theory.

Waveform<====>47592<====>Waveform A waveform is the shape and form of a signal such as a wave moving in a physical medium or an abstract representation. In many cases, the medium in which the wave propagates does not permit a direct observation of the true form.  In these cases, the term "waveform" refers to the shape of a graph of the varying quantity against time.  An instrument called an oscilloscope can be used to pictorially represent a wave as a repeating image on a screen. To be more specific, a waveform is depicted by a graph that shows the changes in a recorded signal's amplitude over the duration of recording. 

Manchuria<====>47595<====>Manchuria   Manchuria ( ) was a name first used in the 17th century by Chinese people to refer to a large geographic region in Northeast Asia.  Depending on the context, Manchuria can either refer to a region that falls entirely within the People's Republic of China    or a larger region divided between China and Russia.  The region that falls entirely within modern China is now usually referred to as Northeast China (Dongbei) ( ) in China, although "Manchuria" is widely used outside China to denote the geographical and historical region.  This region is the traditional homeland of the Xianbei, Khitan, and Jurchen (later called Manchu) peoples, who built several states within the area historically (however, no term for "Manchuria" exists in the Manchu language,  which originally referred to the area as the "Three Eastern Provinces").

Simple group<====>47600<====>Simple group In mathematics, a simple group is a nontrivial group whose only normal subgroups are the trivial group and the group itself.   A group that is not simple can be broken into two smaller groups, a normal subgroup and the quotient group, and the process can be repeated.  If the group is finite, then eventually one arrives at uniquely determined simple groups by the Jordan–Hölder theorem.  The complete classification of finite simple groups, completed in 2008, is a major milestone in the history of mathematics. ExamplesFinite simple groupsThe cyclic group G = Z/3Z of congruence classes modulo 3 (see  modular arithmetic) is simple. 

Suspension bridge<====>47607<====>Suspension bridge    A suspension bridge is a type of bridge in which the deck (the load-bearing portion) is hung below suspension cables on vertical suspenders.  The first modern examples of this type of bridge were built in the early 19th century.    Simple suspension bridges, which lack vertical suspenders, have a long history in many mountainous parts of the world. This type of bridge has cables suspended between towers, plus vertical suspender cables that carry the weight of the deck below, upon which traffic crosses.  This arrangement allows the deck to be level or to arc upward for additional clearance. 

Great Belt Fixed Link<====>47610<====>Great Belt Fixed Link The Great Belt Fixed link ( ) is a multi-element fixed link crossing the Great Belt strait between the Danish islands of Zealand and Funen.  It consists of five structures: a road suspension bridge and a railway tunnel between Zealand and the small island Sprogø located in the middle of the Great Belt, and a box girder bridge for both road and rail traffic between Sprogø and Funen.  The "Great Belt Bridge" (Danish: Storebæltsbroen) commonly refers to the suspension bridge, although it may also be used to mean the box-girder bridge or the link in its entirety. 

Doomsday Clock<====>47611<====>Doomsday Clock   The Doomsday Clock is a symbol which represents the likelihood of a man-made global catastrophe.  Maintained since 1947 by the members of the  Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  Science and Security Board,  the Clock represents an analogy for the threat of global nuclear war.  Since 2007, it has also reflected climate change  and new developments in the life sciences and technology that could inflict irrevocable harm to humanity.    The Clock represents the hypothetical global catastrophe as "midnight" and The Bulletin s opinion on how close the world is to a global catastrophe as a number of "minutes" to midnight. 

Hexactinellid<====>47612<====>Hexactinellid Hexactinellid sponges are sponges with a skeleton made of four- and/or six-pointed siliceous spicules, often referred to as glass sponges.  They are usually classified along with other sponges in the phylum Porifera, but some researchers consider them sufficiently distinct to deserve their own phylum, Symplasma. BiologyGlass sponges are relatively uncommon and are mostly found at depths from   although the species Oopsacas minuta has been found in shallow water while others have been found much deeper.  They are found in all oceans of the world, although they are particularly common in Antarctic and Northern Pacific waters. 

Rook (chess)<====>47615<====>Rook (chess) A rook ( ; ♖,♜) is a piece in the strategy board game of chess.  Formerly the piece was called the tower, marquess, rector, and comes  .  The term castle is considered informal, incorrect, or old-fashioned.   Each player starts the game with two rooks, one on each of the corner squares on their own side of the board.  Initial placement and movementThe white rooks start on squares a1 and h1, while the black rooks start on a8 and h8.  The rook moves horizontally or vertically, through any number of unoccupied squares (see diagram). 

Bishop (chess)<====>47616<====>Bishop (chess) A bishop (♗,♝) is a piece in the board game of chess.  Each player begins the game with two bishops.  One starts between the   and the king, the other between the   and the queen.  The starting squares are c1 and f1 for White's bishops, and c8 and f8 for Black's bishops.  MovementThe bishop has no restrictions in distance for each move, but is limited to diagonal movement.  Bishops, like all other pieces except the knight, cannot jump over other pieces.  A bishop captures by occupying the square on which an enemy piece sits. 

Chess piece<====>47618<====>Chess piece  A chess piece, or chessman, is any of the 32 movable objects deployed on a chessboard used to play the game of chess.  In a standard game of chess, each of the two players begins a game with the following 16 pieces:1 king1 queen2 rooks2 bishops2 knights8 pawnsIn playing chess, the players take turns moving one of their own chess pieces.  The rules of chess prescribe the types of move a player can make with each type of chess piece. The pieces that belong to each player are distinguished by color.  The lighter colored pieces are referred to as "white", and the player that plays them, "White". 

Knight (chess)<====>47619<====>Knight (chess) The knight (♘ ♞  ) is a piece in the game of chess, representing a knight (armored cavalry).  It is normally represented by a horse's head and neck.  Each player starts with two knights, which begin on the row closest to the player, between the rooks and bishops.  NamesColloquially it is sometimes referred to as a "horse", which is also the translation of the piece's name in several languages.  Some languages refer to it as the "jumper", reflecting the knight's ability to move over pieces in its way: Polish skoczek, Danish/Norwegian springer, German Springer, Slovene skakač. 

Henry Clay<====>47620<====>Henry Clay    Henry Clay Sr.  (April 12, 1777 – June 29, 1852) was an American lawyer, planter, and statesman who represented Kentucky in both the United States Senate and House of Representatives.  After serving three non-consecutive terms as Speaker of the House of Representatives, Clay helped elect John Quincy Adams as president, and Adams subsequently appointed Clay as Secretary of State.  Clay served four separate terms in the Senate, including stints from 1831 to 1842 and from 1849 to 1852.  He ran for the presidency in 1824, 1832 and 1844, and unsuccessfully sought his party's nomination in 1840 and 1848. 

Isabella of France<====>47621<====>Isabella of France    Isabella of France (1295 – 22 August 1358), sometimes described as the She-Wolf of France, was Queen of England as the wife of Edward II, and regent of England from 1326 until 1330.  She was the youngest surviving child and only surviving daughter of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre.  Queen Isabella was notable at the time for her beauty, diplomatic skills, and intelligence. Isabella arrived in England at the age of 12  during a period of growing conflict between the king and the powerful baronial factions.  Her new husband was notorious for the patronage he lavished on his favourite, Piers Gaveston, but the queen supported Edward during these early years, forming a working relationship with Piers and using her relationship with the French monarchy to bolster her own authority and power. 

Caernarfon<====>47622<====>Caernarfon Caernarfon ( ;  ) is a royal town, community, and port in Gwynedd, Wales, with a population of 9,615.  It lies along the A487 road, on the eastern shore of the Menai Strait, opposite the Isle of Anglesey.  The city of Bangor is   to the north-east, while Snowdonia fringes Caernarfon to the east and south-east.  Carnarvon and Caernarvon are Anglicised spellings that were superseded in 1926 and 1974, respectively.  The villages of Bontnewydd and Caeathro are close by. Abundant natural resources in and around the Menai Straits enabled human habitation in prehistoric Britain. 

Free Trade Area of the Americas<====>47623<====>Free Trade Area of the AmericasThe Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA;  , ALCA;  , ZLÉA;  , ALCA;  ) was a proposed agreement to eliminate or reduce the trade barriers among all countries in the Americas, excluding Cuba. HistoryIn the latest round of negotiations, trade ministers from 34 countries met in Miami, Florida, in the United States, in November 2003 to discuss the proposal.   The proposed agreement was an extension of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Canada, Mexico, and the United States.  Opposing the proposal were Cuba, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, Dominica, and Nicaragua (all of which entered the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas in response), and Mercosur member states. 

Pawn (chess)<====>47624<====>Pawn (chess) The pawn (♙,♟) is the most numerous piece in the game of chess, and in most circumstances, also the weakest.  It historically represents infantry, or more particularly, armed peasants or pikemen.   Each player begins a game with eight pawns, one on each square of the   immediately in front of the other pieces.  (The white pawns start on a2, b2, c2, . . . , h2; the black pawns start on a7, b7, c7, . . . , h7. )Individual pawns are referred to by the   on which they stand.  For example, one speaks of "White's f-pawn" or "Black's b-pawn", or less commonly (using descriptive notation), "White's king bishop pawn" or "Black's queen knight pawn". 

Yarkovsky effect<====>47625<====>Yarkovsky effectThe Yarkovsky effect is a force acting on a rotating body in space caused by the anisotropic emission of thermal photons, which carry momentum.  It is usually considered in relation to meteoroids or small asteroids (about 10 cm to 10 km in diameter), as its influence is most significant for these bodies. History of discoveryThe effect was discovered by the Russian civil engineer Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky (1844–1902), who worked on scientific problems in his spare time.  Writing in a pamphlet around the year 1900, Yarkovsky noted that the daily heating of a rotating object in space would cause it to experience a force that, while tiny, could lead to large long-term effects in the orbits of small bodies, especially meteoroids and small asteroids. 

Llywelyn ap Gruffudd<====>47627<====>Llywelyn ap Gruffudd    Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (c.  1223 – 11 December 1282), sometimes written as Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, also known as Llywelyn the Last, or, in Welsh, Llywelyn Ein Llyw Olaf ( ), was Prince of Wales (Latin: Princeps Wallie; Welsh: Tywysog Cymru) from 1258 until his death at Cilmeri in 1282.

Genealogy and early lifeLlywelyn was the second of the four sons of Gruffudd, the eldest son of Llywelyn the Great, and Senana ferch Caradog, the daughter of Caradoc ap Thomas ap  Rhodri, Lord of Anglesey. 

Bomb<====>47628<====>Bomb    A bomb is an explosive weapon that uses the exothermic reaction of an explosive material to provide an extremely sudden and violent release of energy.  Detonations inflict damage principally through ground- and atmosphere-transmitted mechanical stress, the impact and penetration of pressure-driven projectiles, pressure damage, and explosion-generated effects.Bombs have been in use since the 11th century in Song Dynasty China.  The term bomb is not usually applied to explosive devices used for civilian purposes such as construction or mining, although the people using the devices may sometimes refer to them as a "bomb". 

Atil<====>47629<====>Atil Atil ( ; cf.    A-de Shui), literally meaning "Big River", was the capital of Khazaria from the middle of the 8th century until the end of the 10th century.  The word is also a Turkic name for the Volga River. HistoryAtil was located along the Volga delta at the northwestern corner of the Caspian Sea.  Following the defeat of the Khazars in the Second Arab-Khazar War, Atil became the capital of Khazaria.  The city is referred to as Khamlij in 9th-century Arab sources, and the name Atil appears in the 10th century.  At its height, the city was a major center of trade, and consisted of three parts separated by the Volga. 

Paella<====>47630<====>Paella  Paella  ( ;  ) is a Valencian rice dish.  Paella has ancient roots, but its modern form originated in the mid-19th century in the area around Albufera lagoon on the east coast of Spain, adjacent to the city of Valencia.Many non-Spaniards view paella as Spain's national dish, but most Spaniards consider it to be a regional Valencian dish.  Valencians, in turn, regard paella as one of their identifying symbols. Types of paella include Valencian paella, vegetable paella ( ), seafood paella ( ), and mixed paella ( ), among many others. 

Khazaran<====>47631<====>Khazaran Khazaran was a city in the Khazar kingdom, located on the eastern bank of the lower Volga River. It was connected to Atil by a pontoon bridge.Khazaran was later inhabited primarily by Muslims and featured numerous mosques, minarets, and madrasas. It was a bustling trade center easily reachable by ship from the Caspian Sea and Volga River, and many of its inhabitants were crafters, fishers, and traders. The leader of the city was a Muslim official known as the Khazz; in Arab sources the title given is sometimes vizier.    

Falles<====>47632<====>Falles  The Falles ( , sing.  Falla;  ) is a traditional celebration held in commemoration of Saint Joseph in the city of Valencia, Spain.  The term Falles refers to both the celebration and the monuments burnt during the celebration.A number of towns in the Valencian Community have similar celebrations inspired by the original Falles de València celebration.  The Falles festival was added to UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage of humanity list on 30 November 2016.Each neighbourhood of the city has an organised group of people, the Casal faller, that works all year long holding fundraising parties and dinners, usually featuring the noted dish, paella,    a specialty of the region. 

Samandar (city)<====>47634<====>Samandar (city)  Samandar (also Semender) was a city in Khazaria on the western shore of the Caspian Sea, south of the city of Atil, in the North Caucasus.  The exact location of the city is unknown, but most likely, it was situated on the Terek river near the present-day city of Kizlyar, which, like Samandar, is noted for its vineyards.  According to the Soviet archeologist Mikhail Artamonov, remains of a large town have been found deep in the woods along the lower Terek. The name of the city may derive from the name of a Hunnish tribe "Zabender". 

Murphy's law<====>47635<====>Murphy's law   Murphy's law is an adage or epigram that is typically stated as: "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong". HistoryThe perceived perversity of the universe has long been a subject of comment, and precursors to the modern version of Murphy's law are not hard to find.   The concept may be as old as humanity.    Recent significant research in this area has been conducted by members of the American Dialect Society.  Society member Stephen Goranson has found a version of the law, not yet generalized or bearing that name, in a report by Alfred Holt at an 1877 meeting of an engineering society. 

International Sign<====>47636<====>International Sign International Sign (IS) is a contact variety of sign language used in a variety of different contexts, particularly at international meetings such as the World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) congress, events such as the Deaflympics, in video clips produced by Deaf people and watched by other Deaf people from around the world, and informally when travelling and socialising.  It is a sign-language pidgin.  It is not as conventionalised or complex as natural sign languages, and has a limited lexicon. NamingWhile the more commonly used term is International Sign, it is sometimes referred to as Gestuno,  or International Sign Pidgin  and International Gesture (IG). 

Kerch<====>47638<====>Kerch   Kerch ( ,  , Old East Slavic: Кърчевъ, Ancient Greek:   Pantikapaion,  ,  ) is a city of regional significance on the Kerch Peninsula in the east of the Crimea.

Liane Gabora<====>47639<====>Liane Gabora Liane Gabora is a professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia - Okanagan.  She is best known for her theory of the "Origin of the modern mind through conceptual closure. "  This built on her earlier work on "Autocatalytic closure in a cognitive system: A tentative scenario for the origin of culture. "Career Gabora has contributed to the study of cultural evolution and evolution of societies, focusing strongly on the role of personal creativity, as opposed to memetic imitation or instruction, in differentiating modern human from prior hominid or modern ape culture.  In particular, she seems to follow feminist economists and green economists in making a very strong, indeed pivotal, distinction between creative "enterprise", invention, art or "individual capital" and imitative "meme", rule, social category or "instructional capital". 

British Sign Language<====>47640<====>British Sign Language British Sign Language  (BSL) is a sign language used in the United Kingdom (UK), and is the first or preferred language of some deaf people in the UK; there are 125,000  deaf adults in the UK who use BSL plus an estimated 20,000 children.  In 2011, 15,000 people, living in England and Wales, reported themselves using BSL as their main language.   The language makes use of space and involves movement of the hands, body, face and head.  Many thousands of people who are not deaf also use BSL, as hearing relatives of deaf people, sign language interpreters or as a result of other contact with the British deaf community. 

Standard Model<====>47641<====>Standard Model  The Standard Model of particle physics is the theory describing three of the four known fundamental forces (the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions, and not including the gravitational force) in the universe, as well as classifying all known elementary particles.  It was developed in stages throughout the latter half of the 20th century, through the work of many scientists around the world,with the current formulation being finalized in the mid-1970s upon experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks.   Since then, confirmation of the top quark (1995), the tau neutrino (2000), and the Higgs boson (2012) have added further credence to the Standard Model. 

Castling<====>47642<====>Castling    Castling is a move in the game of chess involving a player's king and either of the player's original rooks.  It is the only move in chess in which a player moves two pieces in the same move, and it is the only move aside from the knight's move where a piece can be said to "jump over" another.  Castling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook on the player's first  , then moving the rook to the square over which the king crossed.   Castling may only be done if the king has never moved, the rook involved has never moved, the squares between the king and the rook involved are unoccupied, the king is not in check, and the king does not cross over or end on a square in which it would be in check. 

Michel Foucault<====>47643<====>Michel Foucault  Paul-Michel Foucault (15 October 1926 – 25 June 1984), generally known as Michel Foucault ( ), was a French philosopher, historian of ideas, social theorist, and literary critic. Foucault's theories primarily address the relationship between power and knowledge, and how they are used as a form of social control through societal institutions.  Though often cited as a post-structuralist and postmodernist, Foucault rejected these labels, preferring to present his thought as a critical history of modernity.  His thought has influenced academics, especially those working in sociology, cultural studies, literary theory and critical theory.  Activist groups have also found his theories compelling. 

Hippie<====>47646<====>Hippie  A hippie (sometimes spelled hippy  ) is a member of a counterculture, originally a youth movement that began in the United States during the mid-1960s and spread to other countries around the world.  The word hippie came from hipster and used to describe beatniks who moved into New York City's Greenwich Village and San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district.  The term hippie first found popularity in San Francisco by Herb Caen, a journalist for the San Francisco Chronicle. The origins of the terms hip and hep are uncertain.   By the 1940s, both had become part of African American jive slang and meant "sophisticated; currently fashionable; fully up-to-date". 

Reproducibility<====>47651<====>Reproducibility Reproducibility is the ability to get the same research results or inferences, based on the raw data and computer programs provided by researchers.  A related concept is replicability, meaning the ability to independently achieve non identical conclusions that are at least similar, when differences in sampling, research procedures and data analysis methods may exist.   Reproducibility and replicability together are among the main beliefs of ‘the scientific method’ - with the concrete expressions of the ideal/idea of such a method varying considerably across research disciplines and fields of study  . The values obtained from distinct experimental trials are said to be commensurate if they are obtained according to the same reproducible experimental description and procedure. 

Chess clock<====>47653<====>Chess clock A chess clock consists of two adjacent clocks with buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, so that the two clocks never run simultaneously.  Chess clocks are used in chess and other two-player games where the players move in turn.  The purpose is to keep track of the total time each player takes for his or her own moves, and ensure that neither player overly delays the game. Chess clocks were first used extensively in tournament chess, and are often called game clocks.   The first time that game clocks were used in a chess tournament was in the London 1883 tournament. 

Kamov<====>47656<====>Kamov Kamov ( ) is a Russian rotorcraft manufacturing company based in Lyubertsy, Russia. The Kamov Design Bureau (design office prefix Ka) has more recently specialised in compact helicopters with coaxial rotors, suitable for naval service and high-speed operations.

Galactic cosmic ray<====>47686<====>Galactic cosmic ray

Cosmic ray<====>47687<====>Cosmic ray  Cosmic rays are high-energy radiation, mainly originating outside the Solar System  and even from distant galaxies.   Upon impact with the Earth's atmosphere, cosmic rays can produce showers of secondary particles that sometimes reach the surface.  Composed primarily of high-energy protons and atomic nuclei, they are of mysterious origin.  Data from the Fermi Space Telescope (2013)    have been interpreted as evidence that a significant fraction of primary cosmic rays originate from the supernova explosions of stars.Active galactic nuclei are also theorized to produce cosmic rays.

Most commonly two pieces are threatened, which is also sometimes called a  .  The attacker usually aims to gain   by capturing one of the opponent's pieces.  The defender often finds it difficult to counter two or more threats in a single move.  The attacking piece is called the forking piece; the pieces attacked are said to be forked.  A piece that is defended can still said to be forked if the forking piece has a lower value. 

Backyard Blitz<====>47692<====>Backyard Blitz   Backyard Blitz was a Logie Award winning Australian lifestyle and DIY television program that aired on the Nine Network between 2000 through to 2007 before its cancellation.  It was hosted by Jamie Durie and was produced by Don Burke. The show featured a very similar premise to the show Ground Force, in which a team of gardeners employed by the show descend on a supposedly worthy individual's place and improve the garden for the cameras within a specified time limit.  This similarity in fact led to legal action being taken by the rival Seven Network who at the time was set to debut an Australian version of Ground Force.

Pin (chess)<====>47694<====>Pin (chess)In chess, a pin is a situation brought on by an attacking piece in which a defending piece cannot move without exposing a more valuable defending piece on its other side to capture by the attacking piece.  "To pin" refers to the action of the attacking piece inducing the pin, and the defending piece so restricted is described as pinned. Only pieces that can move an indefinite number of squares in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line; i. e. , bishops, rooks and queens, can pin opposing pieces.  Kings, knights, and pawns cannot pin.  Any piece may be pinned except the king, as the king must be immediately removed from check under all circumstances.

Coral<====>47700<====>Coral  Corals are marine invertebrates in the class Anthozoa of phylum Cnidaria.  They typically live in compact colonies of many identical individual polyps.  The group includes the important reef builders that inhabit tropical oceans and secrete calcium carbonate to form a hard skeleton. A coral "group" is a colony of myriad genetically identical polyps.  Each polyp is a sac-like animal typically only a few millimeters in diameter and a few centimeters in length.  A set of tentacles surround a central mouth opening.  An exoskeleton is excreted near the base.  Over many generations, the colony thus creates a large skeleton characteristic of the species. 

Torture<====>47702<====>Torture  Torture (from the Latin tortus, "twisted") is the act of deliberately inflicting physical or psychological pain in order to fulfill some desire of the torturer or compel some action from the victim.  Torture, by definition, is a knowing and intentional act; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict pain without a specific intent to do so are not typically considered torture. Torture has been carried out or sanctioned by individuals, groups, and states throughout history from ancient times to modern day, and forms of torture can vary greatly in duration from only a few minutes to several days or longer.

The fibers are then processed into various cotton goods such as linens, while any undamaged cotton is used largely for textiles like clothing.  Seeds may be used to grow more cotton or to produce cottonseed oil.   Handheld roller gins had been used in the Indian subcontinent since at earliest 500 CE and then in other regions. 

FreeCell<====>47711<====>FreeCell FreeCell is a solitaire-based card game played with a 52-card standard deck.  It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable.Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand). A version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system. RulesConstruction and layoutOne standard 52-card deck is used. There are four open cells and four open foundations.   Some alternate rules use between one and ten cells. Cards are dealt face-up into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. 

Direct current<====>47713<====>Direct current  Direct current (DC) is the unidirectional flow of electric charge.  A battery is a good example of a DC power supply.  Direct current may flow in a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams.  The electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current (AC).  A term formerly used for this type of current was galvanic current.  The abbreviations AC and DC are often used to mean simply alternating and direct, as when they modify current or voltage.

High-voltage direct current<====>47716<====>High-voltage direct currentA high-voltage, direct current (HVDC) electric power transmission system (also called a power super highway or an electrical super highway)uses direct current for the bulk transmission of electrical power, in contrast with the more common alternating current (AC) systems.   For long-distance transmission, HVDC systems may be less expensive and suffer lower electrical losses.  For underwater power cables, HVDC avoids the heavy currents required to charge and discharge the cable capacitance each cycle.  For shorter distances, the higher cost of DC conversion equipment compared to an AC system may still be justified, due to other benefits of direct current links. 

Srinivasa Ramanujan<====>47717<====>Srinivasa Ramanujan Srinivasa Ramanujan   ( ;   ; 22 December 1887 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician who lived during the British Rule in India.  Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics,  he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems considered to be unsolvable.  Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation; it was quickly recognized by Indian mathematicians.  Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work, in 1913 he began a postal partnership with the English mathematician G. 

Coulomb<====>47719<====>Coulomb  The coulomb (symbol: C) is the International System of Units (SI) unit of electric charge.   It is the charge (symbol: Q or q) transported by a constant current of one ampere in one second:  1 ~ \text{C} = 1 ~ \text{A} \cdot 1 ~ \text{s} Thus, it is also the amount of excess charge on a capacitor of one farad charged to a potential difference of one volt: 1 ~ \text{C} = 1 ~ \text{F} \cdot 1 ~ \text{V} It is equivalent to the charge of approximately   (  mol)  protons, and −1 C is equivalent to the charge of approximately   electrons.

Howard County, Maryland<====>47731<====>Howard County, Maryland  Howard County is a county located in the central part of the U. S.  state of Maryland.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 287,085.Its county seat is Ellicott City.    Howard County is included in the Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, MD Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Washington-Baltimore-Arlington, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA Combined Statistical Area.  However, recent development in the south of the county has led to some realignment towards the Washington, D. C.  media and employment markets.  The county is home to Columbia, a major planned community of approximately 100,000 founded by developer James Rouse in 1967. 

Fourier-transform spectroscopy<====>47732<====>Fourier-transform spectroscopyFourier-transform spectroscopy is a measurement technique whereby spectra are collected based on measurements of the coherence of a radiative source, using time-domain or space-domain measurements of the electromagnetic radiation or other type of radiation. It can be applied to a variety of types of spectroscopy including optical spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, FT-NIRS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI),  mass spectrometry and electron spin resonance spectroscopy.  There are several methods for measuring the temporal coherence of the light (see: field-autocorrelation), including the continuous wave Michelson or Fourier-transform spectrometer and the pulsed Fourier-transform spectrograph (which is more sensitive and has a much shorter sampling time than conventional spectroscopic techniques, but is only applicable in a laboratory environment).

Brooklyn Bridge<====>47742<====>Brooklyn Bridge   The Brooklyn Bridge is a hybrid cable-stayed/suspension bridge in New York City and is one of the oldest roadway bridges in the United States.  Started in 1869 and completed fourteen years later in 1883, it connects the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn, spanning the East River.  It has a main span of   and was the first steel-wire suspension bridge constructed.  It was originally called the New York and Brooklyn Bridge and the East River Bridge, but it was later dubbed the Brooklyn Bridge, a name coming from an earlier January 25, 1867, letter to the editor of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle  and formally so named by the city government in 1915. 

Land for peace<====>47744<====>Land for peaceLand for peace is an interpretation of UN Security Council Resolution 242 which has formed the basis of subsequent Arab-Israeli peace making.  The name Land for Peace is derived from the wording of the resolution's first operative paragraph which affirms that peace should include the application of two principles: Withdrawal of Israeli forces (Giving Up Land), and Termination of all claims or states of belligerency (Making Peace).  Since the resolution stipulates that both principles should apply, they can be viewed jointly as giving up land for peace, referred to more concisely as 'land for peace'.  This interpretation is widely contested because it implies that Israeli withdrawal is linked to its neighbours' willingness to formally make peace. 

Gloucestershire<====>47751<====>Gloucestershire Gloucestershire ( ,  ; formerly abbreviated as Gloucs.  in print but now often as Glos. ) is a county in South West England.  The county comprises part of the Cotswold Hills, part of the flat fertile valley of the River Severn, and the entire Forest of Dean. The county town is the city of Gloucester, and other principal towns include Cheltenham, Cirencester, Stroud, Tewkesbury and Dursley. Gloucestershire borders Herefordshire to the northwest, Wiltshire to the south, Bristol and Somerset to the south west, Worcestershire to the north, Oxfordshire to the east, Warwickshire to the northeast, and the Welsh county of Monmouthshire to the west. 

Domesday Book<====>47752<====>Domesday Book  {{Infobox manuscript }}Domesday Book (  or  ;   Latin: Liber de Wintonia "Book of Winchester") is a manuscript record of the "Great Survey" of much of England and parts of Wales completed in 1086 by order of King William the Conqueror.  The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle states:    Then, at the midwinter [1085], was the king in Glocester with his council . . .  .  After this had the king a large meeting, and very deep consultation with his council, about this land; how it was occupied, and by what sort of men. 

Philippa of Hainault<====>47754<====>Philippa of Hainault   Philippa of Hainault (Middle French: Philippe de Hainaut; 24 June  1314 – 15 August 1369) was Queen of England as the wife of King Edward III.   Edward promised in 1326 to marry her within the following two years.   She was married to Edward, first by proxy, when Edward dispatched the Bishop of Coventry "to marry her in his name" in Valenciennes (second city in importance of the county of Hainaut) in October 1327.   The marriage was celebrated formally in York Minster on 24 January 1328, some months after Edward's accession to the throne of England.

There are more isometry groups than these two, of the same abstract group type.The notation   denotes the direct product of the two groups; G n  denotes the direct product of a group with itself n times. G ⋊ H denotes a semidirect product where H acts on G; this may also depend on the choice of action of H on GAbelian and simple groups are noted. (For groups of order  , the simple groups are precisely the cyclic groups Z n , for prime n.) The equality sign ("=") denotes isomorphism.The identity element in the cycle graphs is represented by the black circle.  The lowest order for which the cycle graph does not uniquely represent a group is order 16.In the lists of subgroups, the trivial group and the group itself are not listed.  Where there are several isomorphic subgroups, the number of such subgroups is indicated in parentheses.List of small abelian groupsThe finite abelian groups are either cyclic groups, or direct products thereof; see abelian groups.

One of the non-abelian groups is the semidirect product of a normal cyclic subgroup of order p 2  by a cyclic group of order p. The other is the quaternion group for   and a group of exponent p for  . Order p 4 : The classification is complicated, and gets much harder as the exponent of p increases.Most groups of small order have a Sylow p subgroup P with a normal p-complement N for some prime p dividing the order, so can be classified in terms of the possible primes p, p-groups P, groups N, and actions of P on N. In some sense this reduces the classification of these groups to the classification of p-groups. Some of the small groups that do not have a normal p complement include:Order 24: The symmetric group S 4 Order 48: The binary octahedral group and the product  Order 60: The alternating group A 5 .Small groups libraryThe group theoretical computer algebra system GAP contains the "Small Groups library" which provides access to descriptions of small order groups. The groups are listed up to isomorphism. At present, the library contains the following groups: Hans Ulrich Besche The Small Groups library   those of order at most 2000; those of cubefree order at most 50000 (395 703 groups);those of squarefree order;those of order p n  for n at most 6 and p prime;those of order p 7  for p = 3, 5, 7, 11 (907 489 groups);those of order pq n  where q n  divides 2 8 , 3 6 , 5 5  or 7 4  and p is an arbitrary prime which differs from q;those whose orders factorise into at most 3 primes (count with multiplicity).It contains explicit descriptions of the available groups in computer readable format.The smallest order for which the SmallGroups library does not have information is 2048.

Hitchhiking<====>47761<====>Hitchhiking    Hitchhiking (also known as thumbing, hitching, or autostop) is a means of transportation that is gained by asking people, usually strangers, for a ride in their automobile or other vehicle.  A ride is usually, but not always, free. Itinerants have also used hitchhiking as a primary mode of travel for the better part of the last century, and continue to do so today.   Signaling methodThe hitchhikers' methods of signaling to drivers differ around the world.  Many hitchhikers use various hand signals. If the hitchhiker wishes to indicate that he needs a ride, he may simply make a physical gesture or display a written sign. 

Oliver Hazard Perry<====>47762<====>Oliver Hazard Perry   Oliver Hazard Perry (August 23, 1785 – August 23, 1819) was an American naval commander, born in South Kingstown, Rhode Island.  He was the son of United States Navy Captain Christopher Raymond Perry and of Sarah Wallace Alexander, and the older brother of Commodore Matthew C.  Perry. Perry served in the West Indies during the Quasi War of 1798–1800 against France, in the Mediterranean during the Barbary Wars of 1801–1815, and in the Caribbean fighting piracy and the slave trade, but is most noted for his heroic role in the War of 1812 during the 1813 Battle of Lake Erie. 

Environmental economics<====>47763<====>Environmental economics   Environmental economics is a sub-field of economics that is concerned with environmental issues.  Quoting from the National Bureau of Economic Research Environmental Economics program: . . .  Environmental Economics . . .  undertakes theoretical or empirical studies of the economic effects of national or local environmental policies around the world . . .  .  Particular issues include the costs and benefits of alternative environmental policies to deal with air pollution, water quality, toxic substances, solid waste, and global warming.   Environmental economics is distinguished from ecological economics in that ecological economics emphasizes the economy as a subsystem of the ecosystem with its focus upon preserving natural capital. 

CDR coding<====>47766<====>CDR coding In computer science CDR coding is a compressed data representation for Lisp linked lists.  It was developed and patented by the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and implemented in computer hardware in a number of Lisp machines derived from the MIT CADR. CDR coding is in fact a fairly general idea; whenever a data object A ends in a reference to another data structure B, we can instead place the structure B itself there, overlapping and running off the end of A.  By doing this we free the space required by the reference, which can add up if done many times, and also improve locality of reference, enhancing performance on modern machines. 

Threaded code<====>47767<====>Threaded code In computer science, the term threaded code refers to a programming technique where the code has a form that essentially consists entirely of calls to subroutines.  It is often, but not only, found in compiler implementations that generate code in that form and/or are implemented in that form themselves.  The code may be processed by an interpreter, or may simply be a sequence of machine code call instructions. Threaded code has better code density than code generated by alternative code generation techniques and alternative calling conventions, sometimes at the expense of slightly slower execution speed.   However, a program small enough to fit fully in a computer processor's cache may run faster than a larger program that suffers many cache misses. 

Texas Instruments<====>47768<====>Texas Instruments   Texas Instruments Inc.  (TI) is an American technology company that designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits, which it sells to electronics designers and manufacturers globally.   Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, United States, TI is one of the top ten semiconductor companies worldwide, based on sales volume.    Texas Instruments's focus is on developing analog chips and embedded processors, which accounts for more than 85% of their revenue.TI also produces TI digital light processing (DLP) technology and education technology  products including calculators, microcontrollers and multi-core processors. 

Transistor–transistor logic<====>47769<====>Transistor–transistor logicTransistor–transistor logic (TTL) is a class of digital circuits built from bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) and resistors.  It is called transistor–transistor logic because transistors perform both the logic function (e. g. , AND) and the amplifying function (compare with resistor–transistor logic (RTL) and diode–transistor logic (DTL)). TTL integrated circuits (ICs) were widely used in applications such as computers, industrial controls, test equipment and instrumentation, consumer electronics, and synthesizers.   The designation TTL is sometimes used to mean TTL-compatible logic levels, even when not associated directly with TTL integrated circuits, for example as a label on the inputs and outputs of electronic instruments. 

Instruction set architecture<====>47772<====>Instruction set architecture An instruction set architecture (ISA) is an abstract model of a computer.  It is also referred to as architecture or computer architecture.  A realization of an ISA is called an implementation.  An ISA permits multiple implementations that may vary in performance, physical size, and monetary cost (among other things); because the ISA serves as the interface between software and hardware.  Software that has been written for an ISA can run on different implementations of the same ISA.  This has enabled binary compatibility between different generations of computers to be easily achieved, and the development of computer families. 

Maclisp<====>47774<====>MaclispMACLISP (or Maclisp, sometimes styled MacLisp or MacLISP) is a dialect of the Lisp programming language.  It originated at MIT's Project MAC    (from which it derived its prefix) in the late 1960s and was based on Lisp 1. 5.   Richard Greenblatt was the main developer of the original codebase for the PDP-6;  Jon L.  White was responsible for its later maintenance and development.   The name 'Maclisp' started being used in the early 1970s to distinguish it from other forks of PDP-6 Lisp, notably BBN Lisp. HistoryMaclisp is a descendant of Lisp 1. 

Lisp Machine Lisp<====>47775<====>Lisp Machine Lisp Lisp Machine Lisp is a dialect of the Lisp programming language.  A direct descendant of Maclisp, it was initially developed in the mid to late 1970s as the systems programming language for the MIT Lisp machines.  Lisp Machine Lisp was also the Lisp dialect with the most influence on the design of Common Lisp. Lisp Machine Lisp itself branched into three dialects.    Symbolics named their variant ZetaLisp.  Lisp Machines, Inc.  and later Texas Instruments (with the TI Explorer) would share a common code base, but their dialect of Lisp Machine Lisp would differ from the version maintained at the MIT AI Lab by Richard Stallman and others.

Pohnpei<====>47779<====>Pohnpei  Pohnpei "upon (pohn) a stone altar (pei)" (formerly known as Ponape) is an island of the Senyavin Islands which are part of the larger Caroline Islands group.  It belongs to Pohnpei State, one of the four states in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM).  Major population centers on Pohnpei include Palikir, the FSM's capital, and Kolonia, the capital of Pohnpei State.  Pohnpei Island is the largest (334 km²), with a highest point (almost 800m), most populous (34,000 people), and most developed single island in the FSM.  The islanders of Pohnpei have a reputation as being the most welcoming of outsiders among residents of the island group. 

Białystok<====>47782<====>Białystok   Białystok ( ;    ;  ,  ,  ,  ) is the largest city in northeastern Poland and the capital of the Podlaskie Voivodeship. Located in the Białystok Uplands of the Podlaskie Plain on the banks of the Biała River, Białystok ranks second in terms of population density, eleventh in population, and thirteenth in area, of the cities of Poland.  It has historically attracted migrants from elsewhere in Poland and beyond, particularly from Central and Eastern Europe.  This is facilitated by the fact that the nearby border with Belarus is also the eastern border of the European Union, as well as the Schengen Area. 

575<====>47783<====>575    Year 575 (DLXXV) was a common year starting on Tuesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar.  The denomination 575 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placeEuropeThe Franks under Sigibert I pursue his half brother Chilperic I, and conquer the cities Poitiers and Tournai.  While he is proclaimed new king of Neustria by the nobles, Sigibert is assassinated at Vitry-en-Artois (Northern Gaul) by hirelings of Fredegund. Childebert II succeeds his father Sigibert I as king of Austrasia. 

Dr. Mario<====>47785<====>Dr.  Mario is a 1990 action puzzle video game produced by Gunpei Yokoi and designed by Takahiro Harada.  Nintendo developed and published the game for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy consoles.  The game's soundtrack was composed by Hirokazu Tanaka. In this falling block puzzle game, the player's objective is to destroy the viruses populating the on-screen playing field by using colored capsules that are tossed into the field by Mario, who assumes the role of a doctor.  The player manipulates each capsule as it falls, with the goal being to align similar colors which removes the viruses. 

Environmental finance<====>47786<====>Environmental finance  Environmental finance is the use of various financial instruments (usually land trusts and emissions trading) to protect the environment.  The field is part of both environmental economics and the conservation movement. The field of Environmental Finance was first defined by Richard L.  Sandor, American economist and entrepreneur, when he taught the first ever Environmental Finance course at Columbia University in the fall of 1992.  Dr.  Gretchen Daily, of Stanford University has written a book, The New Economy of Nature that addresses the issue of financing ecosystem services. Dr.  Jürg P.  Blum, defined the term environmental finance (Dissertation: Corporate Environmental Responsibility and Corporate Economic Performance. 

214<====>47788<====>214Year 214 (CCXIV) was a common year starting on Saturday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar.  At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Messalla and Suetrius (or, less frequently, year 967 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 214 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placeRoman EmpireThe kingdom of Osroene becomes a province of the Roman Empire. Caracalla's victories in Germany ensure his popularity within the Roman army. 

Quality of life<====>47789<====>Quality of life  Quality of life (QOL) is the general well-being  of individuals and societies, outlining negative and positive features of life.  It observes life satisfaction, including everything from physical health, family, education, employment, wealth, religious beliefs, finance and the environment.   QOL has a wide range of contexts, including the fields of international development, healthcare, politics and employment.  It is important not to mix up the concept of QOL with a more recent growing area of health related QOL (HRQOL ).  An assessment of HRQOL is effectively an evaluation of QOL and its relationship with health. 

Mars program<====>47791<====>Mars program The Mars program was a series of unmanned spacecraft launched by the Soviet Union between 1960 and 1973.  The spacecraft were intended to explore Mars, and included flyby probes, landers and orbiters. Early Mars spacecraft were small, and launched by Molniya rockets.  Starting with two failures in 1969, the heavier Proton-K rocket was used to launch larger 5 tonne spacecraft, consisting of an orbiter and a lander to Mars.  The orbiter bus design was likely somewhat rushed into service and immature,  considering that it performed very reliably in the Venera variant after 1975.  This reliability problem was common to much Soviet space hardware from the late 1960s and early 1970s and was largely corrected with a deliberate policy, implemented in the mid-1970s, of consolidating (or "debugging") existing designs rather than introducing new ones. 

Martian<====>47792<====>Martian A Martian is a native inhabitant of the planet Mars.  Although the search for evidence of life on Mars continues, many science fiction writers have imagined what extraterrestrial life on Mars might be like.  Some writers also use the word Martian to describe a human colonist on Mars. Martians in fiction The earliest known instances of the word "Martian", used as a noun instead of an adjective, were printed in late 1877.  They appeared nearly simultaneously in England and the United States, in magazine articles detailing Asaph Hall's discovery of the moons of Mars in August of that year. 

Voyager program<====>47795<====>Voyager program   The Voyager program is an American scientific program that employs two robotic probes, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, to study the outer Solar System.The probes were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a favorable alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.  Although their original mission was to study only the planetary systems of Jupiter and Saturn, Voyager 2 continued on to Uranus and Neptune.  The Voyagers now explore the outer boundary of the heliosphere in interstellar space; their mission has been extended three times and they continue to transmit useful scientific data. 

Patience<====>47796<====>Patience   Patience (or  ) is the state of endurance under difficult circumstances such as: perseverance in the face of delay; provocation without responding in negative annoyance/anger; or exhibiting forbearance when under strain, especially when faced with longer-term difficulties.  Patience is the level of endurance one can have before negativity.  It is also used to refer to the character trait of being steadfast.  Antonyms include hastiness and  . Scientific perspectives In psychology and in cognitive neuroscience, patience is studied as a decision-making problem, involving the choice of either a small reward in the short-term, or a more valuable reward in the long-term. 

Trogon<====>47798<====>Trogon  The trogons and quetzals are birds in the order Trogoniformes which contains only one family, the Trogonidae.  The family contains 39 species in seven genera.  The fossil record of the trogons dates back 49 million years to the Early Eocene.  They might constitute a member of the basal radiation of the order Coraciiformes  or be closely related to mousebirds and owls.    The word trogon is Greek for "nibbling" and refers to the fact that these birds gnaw holes in trees to make their nests. Trogons are residents of tropical forests worldwide. 

H.M.S. Pinafore<====>47801<====>H. M. S.  Pinafore   H. M. S.  Pinafore; or, The Lass That Loved a Sailor is a comic opera in two acts, with music by Arthur Sullivan and a libretto by W.  S.  Gilbert.  It opened at the Opera Comique in London, on 25 May 1878 and ran for 571 performances, which was the second-longest run of any musical theatre piece up to that time.  H. M. S.  Pinafore was Gilbert and Sullivan's fourth operatic collaboration and their first international sensation. The story takes place aboard the ship HMS Pinafore.  The captain's daughter, Josephine, is in love with a lower-class sailor, Ralph Rackstraw, although her father intends her to marry Sir Joseph Porter, the First Lord of the Admiralty. 

Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy<====>47804<====>Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a non-invasive treatment of kidney stones    (urinary calculosis) and biliary calculi (stones in the gallbladder or in the liver) using an acoustic pulse.  It is also reported to be used for salivary stones    and pancreatic stones.  History Beginning in 1969 and funded by the German Ministry of Defense, Dornier began a study of the effects of shock waves on tissue. In 1972, on the basis of preliminary studies performed by Dornier Medical Systems, an agreement was reached with Egbert Schmiedt, director of the urologic clinic at the University of Munich. 

Vector quantization<====>47805<====>Vector quantization  Vector quantization (VQ) is a classical quantization technique from signal processing that allows the modeling of probability density functions by the distribution of prototype vectors.  It was originally used for data compression.   It works by dividing a large set of points (vectors) into groups having approximately the same number of points closest to them.  Each group is represented by its centroid point, as in k-means and some other clustering algorithms. The density matching property of vector quantization is powerful, especially for identifying the density of large and high-dimensioned data.  Since data points are represented by the index of their closest centroid, commonly occurring data have low error, and rare data high error. 

Averroes<====>47836<====>Averroes   Ibn Rushd ( ; full name  ; 14 April 1126 – 10 December 1198), often Latinized as Averroes ( ), was a  medieval Andalusian polymath.  He wrote on logic, Aristotelian and Islamic philosophy, Islamic theology, the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, psychology, political theory, the theory of Andalusian classical music, geography, mathematics, as well as the medieval sciences of medicine, astronomy, physics, and celestial mechanics.  Ibn Rushd was born in Córdoba, Al Andalus (present-day Spain), and died at Marrakesh in present-day Morocco.  His body was interred in his family tomb at Córdoba. 

Arabian Peninsula<====>47858<====>Arabian Peninsula   The Arabian Peninsula, simplified Arabia  (   , ‘Arabian island’ or    , ‘Island of the Arabs’),  is a peninsula of Western Asia situated northeast of Africa on the Arabian plate.  From a geological perspective, it is considered a subcontinent of Asia.   It is the largest peninsula in the world, at  .   The Arabian Peninsula consists of the countries Yemen, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and parts of Jordan and Iraq.   The peninsula formed as a result of the rifting of the Red Sea between 56 and 23 million years ago, and is bordered by the Red Sea to the west and southwest, the Persian Gulf to the northeast, the Levant to the north and the Indian Ocean to the southeast. 

Information transfer<====>47867<====>Information transferIn telecommunications, information transfer is the process of moving messages containing user information from a source to a sink via a Communication channel. In this sense, information transfer is equivalent to data transmission which highlights more practical, technical aspects.The information transfer rate may or may not be equal to the transmission modulation rate.Bidirectional information transfer is called information exchange.Non-technical meaningIn a non-technical context, information transfer is sometimes used to signify knowledge transfer or teaching.See alsoFederal Standard 1037C in support of MIL-STD-188. 

Data stream<====>47868<====>Data stream  In connection-oriented communication, a data stream is a sequence of digitally encoded coherent signals (packets of data or data packets) used to transmit or receive information that is in the process of being transmitted. Formal definitionIn a formal way, a data stream is any ordered pair   ( s, \Delta )   where:  s   is a sequence of tuples and \Delta   is a sequence of positive real time intervals.References DEFAULTSORT 

Pickup truck<====>47877<====>Pickup truck A pickup truck is a light duty truck having an enclosed cab and an open cargo area with low sides and tailgate.Once a work tool with few creature comforts, in the 1950s consumers began purchasing pickups for lifestyle reasons and by the 1990s less than 15 percent of owners reported use in work as the pickup truck's primary purpose.Today in North America, the pickup is mostly used like a passenger car  and accounts for about 18 per cent of total vehicles sold in the US.  The term pickup is of unknown origin. 

Huntington's disease<====>47878<====>Huntington's disease    Huntington's disease (HD), also known as Huntington's chorea, is an inherited disorder that results in death of brain cells.   The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities.   A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow.As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent.   Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk.    Mental abilities generally decline into dementia.   The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people. 

Roguelike<====>47880<====>Roguelike   Roguelike is a subgenre of role-playing video games, characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated game levels, turn-based gameplay, tile-based graphics, and permanent death of the player-character.  Most roguelikes are based on a high fantasy narrative, reflecting their influence from tabletop role playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. Though the roguelikes Beneath Apple Manor and Sword of Fargoal predate it, the 1980 game Rogue is considered the forerunner and the namesake of the genre, with derivative games mirroring Rogue s character- or sprite-based graphics.  These games were popularized among college students and computer programmers of the 1980s and 1990s, leading to a large number of variants but adhering to these common gameplay elements, often titled the "Berlin Interpretation". 

Disruptive innovation<====>47886<====>Disruptive innovation Types of Innovation  .  Christensen describes as "revolutionary" innovations as "discontinuous" "sustaining innovations".   SustainingAn innovation that does not significantly affect existing markets.  It may be either:EvolutionaryAn innovation that improves a product in an existing market in ways that customers are expecting (e. g. , fuel injection for gasoline engines, which displaced carburetors. )Revolutionary (discontinuous, radical)An innovation that is unexpected, but nevertheless does not affect existing markets (e. g. , the first automobiles in the late 19th century, which were expensive luxury items, and as such very few were sold)DisruptiveAn innovation that creates a new market by providing a different set of values, which ultimately (and unexpectedly) overtakes an existing market (e. 

212<====>47889<====>212Year 212 (CCXII) was a leap year starting on Wednesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar.  At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Asper and Camilius (or, less frequently, year 965 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 212 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.  Events By placeRoman EmpireThe edict of emperor Caracalla (Constitutio Antoniniana) extends Roman citizenship to all free inhabitants of the Roman Empire with the exception of a limited group that may include Egyptians. 

Augur<====>47891<====>Augur  The augur was a priest and official in the classical Roman world.  His main role was the practice of augury - interpreting the will of the gods by studying the flight of birds: whether they were flying in groups or alone, what noises they made as they flew, direction of flight and what kind of birds they were.  This was known as "taking the auspices".   The ceremony and function of the augur was central to any major undertaking in Roman society—public or private—including matters of war, commerce, and religion. The Roman historian Livy stressed the importance of the augurs: "Who does not know that this city was founded only after taking the auspices, that everything in war and in peace, at home and abroad, was done only after taking the auspices?" Etymology Although ancient authors believed that the term "augur" contained the words avis and gero—Latin for "directing the birds"— historical-linguistic evidence points instead to the root aug-: "to increase, to prosper". 

Bay of Bengal<====>47892<====>Bay of Bengal  The Bay of Bengal (Bengali: বঙ্গোপসাগর [bɔŋgopoʃagoɾ], Hindi: बंगाल की खाड़ी [bəŋgɑːl kɪː kʰɑːɽɪː]) is the largest bay in the world, with waters flowing straight out of the Himalayas through Bengal region.  Roughly triangular, it is bordered by India to the West, Northwest and East(A&N Is. ), Myanmar to the East, Sri Lanka to the Southwest, Bangladesh to the North and, Indonesia to the Southeast.  Countries dependent on the Bay of Bengal straddle both South Asia and Southeast Asia. The Bay of Bengal occupies an area of  .  A number of large rivers – the Ganges and three major rivers of Bangladesh the Padma, the Jamuna and Meghna, other rivers such as the Irrawaddy River, Godavari, Mahanadi, Brahmani River, Baitarani,  Krishna and Kaveri flow into the Bay of Bengal. 

Stochastic process<====>47895<====>Stochastic process In probability theory and related fields, a stochastic or random process is a mathematical object usually defined as a collection of random variables.  Historically, the random variables were associated with or indexed by a set of numbers, usually viewed as points in time, giving the interpretation of a stochastic process representing numerical values of some system randomly changing over time, such as the growth of a bacterial population, an electrical current fluctuating due to thermal noise, or the movement of a gas molecule. Stochastic processes are widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner. 

Andaman and Nicobar Islands<====>47898<====>Andaman and Nicobar Islands  {{Infobox settlement }} The Andaman and Nicobar Islands ( ;  ), one of the seven union territories of India, are a group of islands at the juncture of the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea. The territory is   north of Aceh in Indonesia and separated from Thailand and Myanmar (Burma) by the Andaman Sea.  It comprises two island groups, the Andaman Islands and the Nicobar Islands, separated by the 10°N parallel, with the Andamans to the north of this latitude, and the Nicobars to the south (or by 179 km).  The Andaman Sea lies to the east and the Bay of Bengal to the west. 

Elizabeth Woodville<====>47901<====>Elizabeth Woodville  Elizabeth Woodville (also spelled Wydville, Wydeville, or Widvile Although spelling of the family name is usually modernised to "Woodville", it was spelled "Wydeville" in contemporary publications by Caxton and her tomb at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle is inscribed thus; "Edward IV and his Queen Elizabeth Widvile".  ) (c.  1437 Karen Lindsey, Divorced, Beheaded, Survived, xviii, Perseus Books, 1995  – 8 June 1492) was Queen consort of England as the spouse of King Edward IV from 1464 until his death in 1483.  At the time of her birth, her family was mid-ranked in the English aristocracy. 

Upload<====>47902<====>Upload    In computer networks, to upload is to send data to a remote system such as a server or another client so that the remote system can store a copy.  Remote uploadTransferring data from one remote system to another under the control of a local system is remote uploading.  Remote uploading is used by some online file hosting services.  It is also used when the local computer has a slow connection to the remote systems, but they have a fast connection between them.  Without remote uploading functionality, the data would have to first be downloaded to the local host and then uploaded to the remote file hosting server, both times over slow connections. 

Kolkata<====>47905<====>Kolkata    Kolkata is the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal.  Located on the east bank of the Hooghly River, it is the principal commercial, cultural, and educational centre of East India, while the Port of Kolkata is India's oldest operating port and its sole major riverine port.  The city is widely regarded as the "cultural capital" of India, and is also nicknamed the "City of Joy".  In 2011, the city had a population of 4. 5 million, while the population of the city and its suburbs was 14. 

Elizabeth of York<====>47907<====>Elizabeth of York    Elizabeth of York (11 February 1466 – 11 February 1503) was queen consort of England from 1486 until her death.  As the wife of Henry VII, she was the first Tudor queen.  She was the daughter of Edward IV and niece of Richard III, and she married the king following Henry's victory at the Battle of Bosworth which started the last phase of the Wars of the Roses.  She was the mother of King Henry VIII.  Therefore, she was the daughter, sister, niece, wife, mother, and grandmother of successive kings and queens of England.

Jordan River<====>47910<====>Jordan River   The Jordan River (also River Jordan;   Nahar ha-Yarden;   Nahr al-Urdun, Ancient Greek: Ιορδάνης, Iordànes) is a  -long river in the Middle East that flows roughly north to south through the Sea of Galilee and on to the Dead Sea.  Israel and the West Bank border the river to the west, while the Golan Heights and Jordan lie to its east.  Both Jordan and the West Bank take their names from the river. The river has a major significance in Judaism and Christianity.  This is the site where the Israelites crossed into the Promised Land and where Jesus of Nazareth was baptised by John the Baptist. 

Hudson River<====>47911<====>Hudson River   The Hudson River is a   river that flows from north to south primarily through eastern New York in the United States.  The river originates in the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York, flows through the Hudson Valley, and eventually drains into the Atlantic Ocean, between New York City and Jersey City.  The river serves as a political boundary between the states of New Jersey and New York, and further north between New York counties.  The lower half of the river is a tidal estuary, deeper than the body of water into which it flows, occupying the Hudson Fjord, an inlet which formed during the most recent period of North American glaciation, estimated at 26,000 to 13,300 years ago.

News agency<====>47917<====>News agency A news agency is an organization that gathers news reports and sells them to subscribing news organizations, such as newspapers, magazines and radio and television broadcasters.  A news agency may also be referred to as a  wire service, newswire, or news service. Although there are many news agencies around the world, three global news agencies, Agence France-Presse (AFP), Associated Press (AP) and Reuters, have offices in most countries of the world and cover all areas of information.  All three began with and continue to operate on a basic philosophy of providing a single objective news feed to all subscribers; they do not provide separate feeds for conservative or liberal newspapers. 

Free will<====>47921<====>Free will Free will is the ability to choose between different possible courses of action unimpeded.   Free will is closely linked to the concepts of responsibility, praise, guilt, sin and other judgements which apply only to actions that are freely chosen.  It is also connected with the concepts of advice, persuasion, deliberation and prohibition.  Traditionally, only actions that are freely willed are seen as deserving credit or blame.  There are numerous different concerns about threats to the possibility of free will, varying by how exactly it is conceived, which is a matter of some debate. 

Determinism<====>47922<====>Determinism   Determinism is the philosophical theory that all events, including moral choices, are completely determined by previously existing causes.  Determinism is usually understood to preclude free will because it entails that humans cannot act otherwise than they do.  The theory holds that the universe is utterly rational because complete knowledge of any given situation assures that unerring knowledge of its future is also possible.   Some philosophers suggest variants around this basic definition.  A list of a dozen varieties of determinism is provided in    Deterministic theories throughout the history of philosophy have sprung from diverse and sometimes overlapping motives and considerations. 

Queen Victoria<====>47923<====>Queen VictoriaVictoria (Alexandrina Victoria; 24 May 1819 – 22 January 1901) was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 20 June 1837 until her death.  On 1 May 1876, she adopted the additional title of Empress of India. Victoria was the daughter of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the fourth son of King George III.  Both the Duke of Kent and King George III died in 1820, and Victoria was raised under close supervision by her German-born mother, Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld.  She inherited the throne at the age of 18, after her father's three elder brothers had all died, leaving no surviving legitimate children. 

Battle of Naissus<====>47928<====>Battle of Naissus   The Battle of Naissus (268 or 269 AD) was the defeat of a Gothic coalition by the Roman Empire under Emperor Gallienus (or Claudius II) near Naissus (Niš in present-day Serbia).  The events around the invasion and the battle are an important part of the history of the Crisis of the Third Century. The result was a great Roman victory which, combined with the effective pursuit of the invaders in the aftermath of the battle and the energetic efforts of the Emperor Aurelian, largely removed the threat from Germanic tribes in the Balkan frontier for the following decades. 

Strange loop<====>47929<====>Strange loopA strange loop is a   structure that goes through several levels in a  hierarchical system.  It arises when, by moving only upwards or downwards through the system, one finds oneself back where one started.  Strange loops may involve self-reference and paradox.  The concept of a strange loop was proposed and extensively discussed by Douglas Hofstadter in Gödel, Escher, Bach, and is further elaborated in Hofstadter's book I Am a Strange Loop, published in 2007. A tangled hierarchy is a hierarchical consciousness system in which a strange loop appears. DefinitionsA strange loop is a hierarchy of levels, each of which is linked to at least one other by some type of relationship. 

Paul Atreides<====>47937<====>Paul Atreides Paul Atreides ( ; later known as Paul Muad'Dib) is a fictional character in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert.  Paul is a prominent character in the first two novels in the series, Dune (1965) and Dune Messiah (1969), and returns in Children of Dune (1976).  The character is brought back as two different gholas in the Brian Herbert/Kevin J.  Anderson novels which conclude the original series, Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007), and appears in the prequels Paul of Dune (2008) and The Winds of Dune (2009). A primary theme of Dune and its sequels is Frank Herbert's warning about society's tendencies to "give over every decision-making capacity" to a charismatic leader. 

Crisis of the Third Century<====>47942<====>Crisis of the Third Century  The Crisis of the Third Century, also known as Military Anarchy or the Imperial Crisis (AD 235–284), was a period in which the Roman Empire nearly collapsed under the combined pressures of invasion, civil war, plague, and economic depression.  The crisis began with the assassination of Emperor Severus Alexander by his own troops in 235, initiating a 50-year period during which there were at least 26 claimants to the title of emperor, mostly prominent Roman army generals, who assumed imperial power over all or part of the Empire.  The same number of men became accepted by the Roman Senate as emperor during this period and so became legitimate emperors. 

Joseph of Arimathea<====>47944<====>Joseph of Arimathea Joseph of Arimathea was, according to all four canonical Gospels, the man who assumed responsibility for the burial of Jesus after Jesus' crucifixion.  A number of stories that developed during the Middle Ages connect him with both Glastonbury, where he is supposed to have founded the earliest Christian oratory, and also with the Grail legend. Gospel narratives  described him simply as a rich man and disciple of Jesus, but according to   Joseph of Arimathea was "a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God"; and   adds that he "had not consented to their decision and action". 

Madhya Pradesh<====>47945<====>Madhya PradeshMadhya Pradesh  (MP;  ; meaning Central Province) is a state in central India.  Its capital is Bhopal and the largest city is Indore with Jabalpur, Gwalior, and Ujjain being the other major cities.

Union (set theory)<====>47949<====>Union (set theory)In set theory, the union (denoted by ∪) of a collection of sets is the set of all elements in the collection.   It is one of the fundamental operations through which sets can be combined and related to each other. For explanation of the symbols used in this article, refer to the table of mathematical symbols. Union of two setsThe union of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B.   In symbols, A  \cup B = \{ x: x \in A \text{  or  } x \in B\} . 

Musical composition<====>47962<====>Musical composition Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music.  People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music.  In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist.  "Composition" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music "score", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. 

Horse teeth<====>47964<====>Horse teethHorse teeth refers to the dentition of equine species, including horses and donkeys.   Equines are both heterodontous and diphyodontous, which means that they have teeth in more than one shape (there are up to five shapes of tooth in a horse's mouth), and have two successive sets of teeth, the deciduous ("baby teeth") and permanent sets. As grazing animals, good dentition is essential to survival, and continued grazing creates specific patterns of wear, which can be used along with patterns of eruption to estimate the age of the horse. Types of teethA fully developed horse of around five years of age will have between 36 and 44 teeth. 

Cattle age determination<====>47966<====>Cattle age determination  The age of cattle is determined chiefly by examination of the teeth, and less perfectly by the horn rings or the length of the tail brush; however due to bang-tailing, which is the act of cutting the long hairs at the tip of the tail short to identify the animal after management practices, the latter is least reliable. Teeth methodCattle are placed in a cattle crush in order to restrain them prior inspecting the mouth and amount of teeth that each animal has. The temporary teeth are in part erupted at birth, and all the incisors are erupted in twenty days; the first, second and third pairs of temporary molars are erupted in thirty days; the teeth have grown large enough to touch each other by the sixth month. 

Authentication<====>47967<====>Authentication Authentication (from   authentikos, "real, genuine", from αὐθέντης authentes, "author") is the act of confirming the truth of an attribute of a single piece of data claimed true by an entity.  In contrast with identification, which refers to the act of stating or otherwise indicating a claim purportedly attesting to a person or thing's identity, authentication is the process of actually confirming that identity.  It might involve confirming the identity of a person by validating their identity documents, verifying the authenticity of a website with a digital certificate,    determining the age of an artifact by carbon dating, or ensuring that a product is what its packaging and labeling claim to be. 

Battle of Salamis<====>47968<====>Battle of Salamis   The Battle of Salamis ( ;  , Naumachia tēs Salaminos) was a naval battle fought between an alliance of Greek city-states under Themistocles and the Persian Empire under King Xerxes in 480 BC which resulted in a decisive victory for the outnumbered Greeks.  The battle was fought in the straits between the mainland and Salamis, an island in the Saronic Gulf near Athens, and marked the high-point of the second Persian invasion of Greece. To block the Persian advance, a small force of Greeks blocked the pass of Thermopylae, while an Athenian-dominated Allied navy engaged the Persian fleet in the nearby straits of Artemisium. 

Justin I<====>47969<====>Justin I Justin I ( ,  ; 2 February 450 – 1 August 527) was Eastern Roman Emperor from 518 to 527.  He rose through the ranks of the army and ultimately became Emperor, in spite of the fact he was illiterate    and almost 70 years old at the time of accession.  His reign is significant for the founding of the Justinian Dynasty that included his eminent nephew Justinian I and for the enactment of laws that de-emphasized the influence of the old Roman nobility.  His consort was Empress Euphemia. Early careerJustin was a peasant and a swineherd by occupation    from the region of Dardania, which is part of the Prefecture of Illyricum. 

Dr. No (novel)<====>47974<====>Dr.  No (novel)    Dr.  No is the sixth novel by the English author Ian Fleming to feature his British Secret Service agent James Bond.

Address Resolution Protocol<====>47986<====>Address Resolution Protocol The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address associated with a given IPv4 address, a critical function in Internet Protocol (IP) computer networks.  ARP was defined in 1982 by  ,  which is Internet Standard STD 37. ARP is used for mapping a network address such as an IPv4 address, to a physical address, such as a MAC address.  ARP has been implemented with many combinations of network and data link layer technologies, such as IPv4, Chaosnet, DECnet and Xerox PARC Universal Packet (PUP) using IEEE 802 standards, FDDI, X. 

Godavari River<====>47988<====>Godavari River  The Godavari is India's second longest river after the Ganga.  Its source is in Triambakeshwar, Maharashtra.

Earthling<====>47992<====>Earthling  Earthling, a term identifying inhabitants of the planet Earth, is commonly used in science fiction to contrast Earth-born organisms and characters, whose ethnicity or nationality diaspora originated on Earth, with extraterrestrials.  Similar terms are Terran and Gaian. HistoryHistorically, the term "earthling" referred to a mortal inhabitant of the Earth as opposed to spiritual or divine entities.   In Early Modern English, the word was used with the intention of contrasting "earth" with "heaven", and so presenting man as an inhabitant of the sublunary sphere, as opposed to heavenly creatures or deities.    The derivation from the noun earth by means of the suffix -ling is already seen in Old English eyrþling, in the meaning "ploughman".

Urban growth boundary<====>48020<====>Urban growth boundaryAn urban growth boundary, or UGB, is a regional boundary, set in an  attempt to control urban sprawl by, in its simplest form, mandating that the area inside the boundary be used for urban development and the area outside be preserved in its natural state or used for agriculture.  Legislating for an "urban growth boundary" is one way, among many others, of managing the major challenges posed by unplanned urban growth and the encroachment of cities upon agricultural and rural land.  An urban growth boundary circumscribes an entire urbanized area and is used by local governments as a guide to zoning and land use decisions, and by utility and other infrastructure providers to improve efficiency through effective long term planning (e.

Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres<====>48030<====>Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres  Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres ( ; 29 August 1780 – 14 January 1867) was a French Neoclassical painter.  Although he considered himself to be a painter of history in the tradition of Nicolas Poussin and Jacques-Louis David, it is Ingres's portraits, both painted and drawn, that are recognized as his greatest legacy. Ingres was profoundly influenced by past artistic traditions, and aspired to become the guardian of academic orthodoxy against the ascendant Romantic style, exemplified by Eugène Delacroix.  His expressive distortions of form and space made him an important precursor of modern art, influencing Picasso, Matisse and other modernists.

Relativism<====>48041<====>Relativism Relativism is the idea that views are relative to differences in perception and consideration.  There is no universal, objective truth according to relativism; rather each point of view has its own truth.  The major categories of relativism vary in their degree of scope and controversy.   Moral relativism encompasses the differences in moral judgments among people and cultures.    Truth relativism is the doctrine that there are no absolute truths, i. e. , that truth is always relative to some particular frame of reference, such as a language or a culture (cultural relativism).   Descriptive relativism, as the name implies, seeks to describe the differences among cultures and people without evaluation, while normative relativism evaluates the morality or truthfulness of views within a given framework. 

Routing table<====>48043<====>Routing tableIn computer networking a routing table, or routing information base (RIB), is a data table stored in a router or a networked computer that lists the routes to particular network destinations, and in some cases, metrics (distances) associated with those routes.  The routing table contains information about the topology of the network immediately around it.  The construction of routing tables is the primary goal of routing protocols.  Static routes are entries made in a routing table by non-automatic means and which are fixed rather than being the result of some network topology "discovery" procedure. BasicsA routing table uses the same idea that one does when using a map in package delivery. 

Transcendental argument for the existence of God<====>48044<====>Transcendental argument for the existence of GodThe Transcendental Argument for the Existence of God (TAG) is the argument that attempts to prove God's existence by arguing that logic, morals, and science ultimately presuppose a supreme being, and that God must be the source of logic and morals.   A version was formulated by Immanuel Kant in his 1763 work The Only Possible Argument in Support of a Demonstration of the Existence of God and most contemporary formulations of the transcendental argument have been developed within the framework of Christian presuppositional apologetics.    Transcendental reasoningTranscendental arguments should not be confused with transcendent arguments, or arguments for the existence of something transcendent. 

Syllogism<====>48046<====>SyllogismA syllogism (  syllogismos, "conclusion, inference") is a kind of logical argument that applies deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion based on two or more propositions that are asserted or assumed to be true. In its earliest form, defined by Aristotle, from the combination of a general statement (the major premise) and a specific statement (the minor premise), a conclusion is deduced.  For example, knowing that all men are mortal (major premise) and that Socrates is a man (minor premise), we may validly conclude that Socrates is mortal.  Syllogistic arguments are usually represented in a three-line form: All men are mortal. 

Engrish<====>48047<====>Engrish Engrish ( ;   Ingurisshu,  ) is a slang term for the misuse or corruption of the English language by native speakers of Asian languages.   The term itself relates to Japanese speakers' tendency to inadvertently substitute the English phonemes "R" and "L" for one another, a process known as Lallation, because, unlike English, the Japanese language has only one liquid consonant (traditionally romanized with "R").  The related term "wasei-eigo" refers to pseudo-anglicisms that have entered into everyday Japanese. While the term may refer to spoken English, it is more often used to describe written English. 

Autonomous robot<====>48049<====>Autonomous robotAn autonomous robot performs behaviors or tasks with a high degree of autonomy, which is particularly desirable in fields such as spaceflight, household maintenance (such as cleaning), waste water treatment and delivering goods and services. Some modern factory robots are "autonomous" within the strict confines of their direct environment.  It may not be that every degree of freedom exists in their surrounding environment, but the factory robot's workplace is challenging and can often contain chaotic, unpredicted variables.  The exact orientation and position of the next object of work and (in the more advanced factories) even the type of object and the required task must be determined. 

David Gauthier<====>48050<====>David Gauthier   David Gauthier ( ; born 10 September 1932) is a Canadian-American philosopher best known for his neo-Hobbesian social contract (contractarian) theory of morality, as developed in his 1986 book Morals by Agreement. Life and careerGauthier was born in Toronto in 1932 and educated at the University of Toronto (B. A.  Hons. , 1954), Harvard University (A. M. , 1955), and the University of Oxford (B.  Phil. , 1957; D.  Phil. , 1961).  He taught at the University of Toronto from 1958 until 1980, when he joined the Department of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh, where he is now Distinguished Service Professor emeritus. 

Moral relativism<====>48053<====>Moral relativism Moral relativism may be any of several philosophical positions concerned with the differences in moral judgments across different people and cultures.  Descriptive moral relativism holds only that some people do in fact disagree about what is moral; meta-ethical moral relativism holds that in such disagreements, nobody is objectively right or wrong; and normative moral relativism holds that because nobody is right or wrong, we ought to tolerate the behavior of others even when we disagree about the morality of it. Not all descriptive relativists adopt meta-ethical relativism, and moreover, not all meta-ethical relativists adopt normative relativism.  Richard Rorty, for example, argued that relativist philosophers believe "that the grounds for choosing between such opinions is less algorithmic than had been thought", but not that any belief is as valid as any other. 

Argument from nonbelief<====>48055<====>Argument from nonbelief  An argument from nonbelief is a philosophical argument that asserts an inconsistency between the existence of God and a world in which people fail to recognize him.   It is similar to the classic argument from evil in affirming an inconsistency between the world that exists and the world that would exist if God had certain desires combined with the power to see them through. There are two key varieties of the argument.   The argument from reasonable nonbelief (or the argument from divine hiddenness) was first elaborated in J.  L.  Schellenberg's 1993 book Divine Hiddenness and Human Reason.

Fibonacci coding<====>48063<====>Fibonacci coding  In mathematics and computing, Fibonacci coding is a universal code  which encodes positive integers into binary code words.  It is one example of representations of integers based on Fibonacci numbers.  Each code word ends with "11" and contains no other instances of "11" before the end. The Fibonacci code is closely related to the Zeckendorf representation, a positional numeral system that uses Zeckendorf's theorem and has the property that no number has a representation with consecutive 1s.  The Fibonacci code word for a particular integer is exactly the integer's Zeckendorf representation with the order of its digits reversed and an additional "1" appended to the end. 

Sesame Street<====>48064<====>Sesame Street Sesame Street is an American educational children's television series that combines live action, sketch comedy, animation and puppetry.  It is produced by Sesame Workshop (formerly known as the Children's Television Workshop) and was created by Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett.  The program is known for its images communicated through the use of Jim Henson's Muppets, and includes short films, with humor and cultural references.  The series premiered on November 10, 1969, to positive reviews, some controversy, Linton, Caroline.  "'Sesame Street' Turns 45: 14 Most Controversial Moments. " AM New York. 

Polder<====>48065<====>Polder  A polder ( ) is a low-lying tract of land enclosed by dikes that forms an artificial hydrological entity, meaning it has no connection with outside water other than through manually operated devices.  There are three types of polder:Land reclaimed from a body of water, such as a lake or the sea bedFlood plains separated from the sea or river by a dikeMarshes separated from the surrounding water by a dike and subsequently drained; these are also known as koogs especially in GermanyThe ground level in drained marshes subsides over time.  All polders will eventually be below the surrounding water level some or all of the time. 

Maurice Ravel<====>48068<====>Maurice Ravel    Joseph Maurice Ravel ( ; 7 March 1875 – 28 December 1937) was a French composer, pianist and conductor.  He is often associated with impressionism along with his elder contemporary Claude Debussy, although both composers rejected the term.  In the 1920s and 1930s Ravel was internationally regarded as France's greatest living composer. Born to a music-loving family, Ravel attended France's premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal.  After leaving the Conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity, incorporating elements of baroque, neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz. 

Goldie Hawn<====>48071<====>Goldie Hawn  Goldie Jeanne Hawn (born November 21, 1945) is an American actress, director, producer, and occasional singer. She rose to fame on the NBC sketch comedy program Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (1968–70) before going on to receive the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in Cactus Flower (1969).  Hawn maintained bankable star status for more than three decades while appearing in films such as There's a Girl in My Soup (1970), Butterflies Are Free (1972), The Sugarland Express (1974),  Shampoo (1975), Foul Play (1978), Seems Like Old Times (1980), and Private Benjamin (1980), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for playing the title role. 

Essentialism<====>48081<====>Essentialism   Essentialism is the view that every entity has a set of attributes that are necessary to its identity and function.   In early Western thought Plato's idealism held that all things have such an "essence," an "Idea" or "Form".  Likewise, in Categories Aristotle proposed that all objects have a substance that, as George Lakoff put it ". . .  make the thing what it is, and without which it would be not that kind of thing".   The contrary view, non-essentialism, denies the need to posit such an "essence'". Essentialism has been controversial from its beginning. 

Great circle<====>48082<====>Great circle A great circle, also known as an orthodrome, of a sphere is the intersection of the sphere and a plane that passes through the center point of the sphere.  A great circle is the largest circle that can be drawn on any given sphere.  Any diameter of any great circle coincides with a diameter of the sphere, and therefore all great circles have the same center and circumference as each other.  This special case of a circle of a sphere is in opposition to a small circle, that is, the intersection of the sphere and a plane that does not pass through the center. 

Sesame Workshop<====>48083<====>Sesame Workshop   Sesame Workshop (SW), formerly Children's Television Workshop (CTW), is an American non-profit organization which has been responsible for the production of several educational children's programs—including its first and best-known, Sesame Street—that have been televised internationally.  Television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and foundation executive Lloyd Morrisett developed with the idea to form an organization to produce Sesame Street, a television series which would help children, especially those from low-income families, prepare for school.  They spent two years, from 1966 to 1968, researching, developing, and raising money for the new series.  Cooney was named as the Workshop's first executive director, which was termed "one of the most important television developments of the decade". 

Virtual management<====>48085<====>Virtual management Virtual management, is the supervision, leadership, and maintenance of virtual teams—dispersed work groups that rarely, if ever, meet face to face.  As the number of virtual teams has grown, brought about by the rise of the Internet, globalization, outsourcing, telecommuting the need to manage them has also grown.  The following article provides information concerning some of the important management factors involved with virtual teams, and the life cycle of managing a virtual team. Due to developments in information technology within the workplace, along with a need to compete globally and address competitive demands, organisations have embraced virtual management structures. 

Embarazada<====>48087<====>Embarazada Embarazada ( ) is the Spanish word for pregnant.  It is a false friend for native English-speaking students of Spanish who may attempt to say "I'm embarrassed" by saying "estoy embarazada".  This phrase actually means "I'm pregnant" in Spanish.  This may be confusing to Spanish speakers who are not familiar with the English word. When Parker Pen entered the Mexican market, its advertisements which claimed that Parker Pens "won't leak in your pocket and embarrass you" was mistranslated to "No te embarazará chorreándose en tu bolsillo", which means "Won't leak in your pocket and impregnate you". 

List of Welsh-language poets (6th century to c. 1600)<====>48088<====>List of Welsh-language poets (6th century to c.  1600)  Much of Welsh language poetry has, until quite recently, been composed in various forms of strict metre (canu caeth), latterly with the encouragement of the eisteddfod movement.  The following list is as inclusive as possible for the years prior to 1600.  It includes as many minor poets as possible to illustrate the range and content of Welsh poetry throughout the ages.  However much early poetry has been lost, and much medieval verse is either anonymous or, usually in the case of mythological poems and prophetic verse, attributed to the 6th-century poet Taliesin or the mythical figure of Myrddin. 

Llywelyn the Great<====>48090<====>Llywelyn the Great Llywelyn the Great ( ,  ), full name Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, (c.  1172 11 April 1240) was a Prince of Gwynedd in north Wales and eventually de facto ruler over most of Wales.  By a combination of war and diplomacy he dominated Wales for 45 years. During Llywelyn's boyhood, Gwynedd was ruled by two of his uncles, who split the kingdom between them, following the death of Llywelyn's grandfather, Owain Gwynedd, in 1170.  Llywelyn had a strong claim to be the legitimate ruler and began a campaign to win power at an early age. 

Carnegie Mellon University<====>48093<====>Carnegie Mellon University   Carnegie Mellon University (Carnegie Mellon or CMU   or  ) is a private research university in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1900 by Andrew Carnegie as the Carnegie Technical Schools, the university became the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1912 and began granting four-year degrees.  In 1967, the Carnegie Institute of Technology merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to form Carnegie Mellon University. The university's   main campus is   from Downtown Pittsburgh.  Carnegie Mellon has seven colleges and independent schools: the College of Engineering, College of Fine Arts, Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, Mellon College of Science, Tepper School of Business, H. 

InterMezzo (file system)<====>48095<====>InterMezzo (file system) InterMezzo was a distributed file system written for the Linux kernel, distributed under the GNU General Public License.  It was included in the standard Linux kernel from version 2. 4. 15 but was dropped from version 2. 6.  InterMezzo is designed to work on top of an existing journaling file system such as ext3, JFS, ReiserFS or XFS.  It was developed around 1999. An InterMezzo system consists of a server, which holds the master copy of the file system, and one or more clients with a cache of the file system.  It works either in a replication mode, in which a client maintains a duplicate of the entire file system, or in an on-demand mode in which the client only requests files that it needs. 

Bitch (slang)<====>48097<====>Bitch (slang)   Bitch, literally meaning a female dog, is a   slang word for a person, commonly a woman, who is belligerent, unreasonable, malicious, a control freak, rudely intrusive or aggressive.  When applied to a man, bitch is a derogatory term for a subordinate.  Its original use as a vulgarism, documented from the fifteenth century, suggested high sexual desire in a woman, comparable to a dog in heat.  The range of meanings has expanded in modern usage.  In a feminist context, it can indicate a strong or assertive woman. The word bitch is one of the most common curse words in the English language. 

Visby<====>48098<====>Visby  Visby   is a locality and the seat of Gotland Municipality in Gotland County, on the island of Gotland, Sweden with 23,880 inhabitants,  .   Visby is also the episcopal see for the Diocese of Visby.  The Hanseatic city of Visby is arguably the best-preserved medieval city in Scandinavia and since 1995, it has been on the UNESCO World Heritage Site list.   Among the most notable historical remains are the   long town wall that encircles the town center, and a number of church ruins. Visby is a popular vacation destination for Scandinavians during the summer and receives thousands of tourists every year. 

Gödel, Escher, Bach<====>48103<====>Gödel, Escher, Bach Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, also known as GEB, is a 1979 book by Douglas Hofstadter.  The tagline "a metaphorical fugue on minds and machines in the spirit of Lewis Carroll" was used by the publisher to describe the book.  By exploring common themes in the lives and works of logician Kurt Gödel, artist M.  C.  Escher, and composer Johann Sebastian Bach, the book expounds concepts fundamental to mathematics, symmetry, and intelligence.  Through illustration and analysis, the book discusses how self-reference and formal rules allow systems to acquire meaning despite being made of "meaningless" elements. 

Locri<====>48104<====>Locri   Locri is a town and comune (municipality) in the province of Reggio Calabria, Calabria, southern Italy.   The name derives from the ancient Greek town Locris.  Today it is an important administrative and cultural centre on the Ionian Coast, in the Italian Province of Reggio Calabria.  HistoryEpizephyrian Locris (from Greek Ἐπιζεφύριοι Λοκροί; from  ἐπί epi, "on", Ζέφυρος (Zephyros, "West Wind, and the plural of Λοκρός, Lokros, "a Locrian," thus "The Locrians upon the West Wind").   was founded about 680 BC on the Italian shore of the Ionian Sea, near modern Capo Zefirio, by the Locrians, apparently by Opuntii (East Locrians) from the city of Opus, but including Ozolae (West Locrians) and Lacedaemonians. 

Dick Bruna<====>48108<====>Dick Bruna Dick Bruna (23 August 1927 – 16 February 2017) was a Dutch author, artist, illustrator and graphic designer. Bruna was best known for his children's books which he authored and illustrated, numbering over 200.  His most notable creation was Miffy (Nijntje in the original Dutch), a small rabbit drawn with heavy graphic lines, simple shapes and primary colors.  Bruna also created stories for characters such as Lottie, Farmer John, and Hettie Hedgehog. Aside from his prolific catalog of children's books, Bruna also illustrated and designed book covers, posters and promotional materials for his father's publishing company A. 

Miffy<====>48109<====>Miffy  Miffy ( , pronounced  ) is a small female rabbit in a series of picture books drawn and written by Dutch artist Dick Bruna.  The original Dutch name, "Nijntje", is a shortening of the diminutive konijntje, "little rabbit". The first Miffy book was produced in 1955, and almost 30 others have followed.  In total they have sold over 85 million copies, and led to two separate television series as well as items such as clothes and toys featuring the character.  A feature-length film, Miffy the Movie, was released on 30 January 2013. Three television series based on the character have been produced: Dick Bruna's Miffy Storybook Classics, which ran from January 1, 1992 until December 31, 1992, Miffy and Friends, which ran from April 7, 2003 until August 10, 2007 on Noggin in the United States, and Miffy's Adventures Big and Small, which premiered 2 October 2015 on Nick Jr. 

Tonya Harding<====>48110<====>Tonya Harding   Tonya Maxene Price known professionally as Tonya Harding   (born November 12, 1970)   is a retired American figure skater.  She was the 1991 U. S.  champion and 1991 World Championship silver medalist.  Harding is also a two-time Olympian and a two-time Skate America Champion.   She was the first woman to successfully execute two triple axels in a single competition, and the first to complete a triple axel in combination with a double toe loop. In late 1993, Harding was an Olympian hopeful when she became engulfed in controversy following an attack on skating rival Nancy Kerrigan. 

Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication<====>48113<====>Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication    The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) provides a network that enables financial institutions worldwide to send and receive information about financial transactions in a secure, standardized and reliable environment.  SWIFT also sells software and services to financial institutions, much of it for use on the SWIFTNet Network, and ISO 9362.  Business Identifier Codes (BICs, previously Bank Identifier Codes) are popularly known as "SWIFT codes". The majority of international interbank messages use the SWIFT network.   , SWIFT linked more than 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries and territories, who were exchanging an average of over 15 million messages per day (compared to an average of 2. 

Roman naming conventions<====>48125<====>Roman naming conventionsOver the course of some fourteen centuries, the Romans and other peoples of Italy employed a system of nomenclature that differed from that used by other cultures of Europe and the Mediterranean, consisting of a combination of personal and family names.   Although conventionally referred to as the tria nomina, the combination of praenomen, nomen, and cognomen that have come to be regarded as the basic elements of the Roman name in fact represent a continuous process of development, from at least the seventh century BC to the end of the seventh century AD.   The names developed as part of this system became a defining characteristic of Roman civilization, and although the system itself vanished during the early Middle Ages, the names themselves exerted a profound influence on the development of European naming practices, and many continue to survive in modern languages. 

Alsace<====>48129<====>AlsaceAlsace ( ,   ; Alsatian: ’s Elsass  ; German: Elsass   ;  ) is a cultural and historical region in eastern France now located in the administrative region of Grand Est.  Alsace is located on France's eastern border and on the west bank of the upper Rhine adjacent to Germany and Switzerland. From 1982 until January 2016, Alsace was also the smallest (but not the least populated) of 22 administrative régions in metropolitan France, consisting of the Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin departments.  Territorial reform passed by the French legislature in 2014 resulted in the merger of the Alsace administrative region with Champagne-Ardenne and Lorraine to form Grand Est. 

Hare<====>48130<====>Hare  Hares and jackrabbits are leporids belonging to the genus Lepus.  Hares are classified into the same family as rabbits.  They are similar in size and form to rabbits and eat the same diet.  They are generally herbivorous and long-eared, they are fast runners, and they typically live solitarily or in pairs.  Hare species are native to Africa, Eurasia, North America, and the Japanese archipelago. Five leporid species with "hare" in their common names are not considered true hares: the hispid hare (Caprolagus hispidus), and four species known as red rock hares (comprising Pronolagus).  Meanwhile, jackrabbits are hares rather than rabbits. 

Berbers<====>48132<====>Berbers    Berbers or Amazighs (  Imaziɣen; singular: ⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖ Amaziɣ / Amazigh) are an ethnic group indigenous to North Africa, primarily inhabiting the Maghreb.  They are distributed in an area stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Siwa Oasis in Egypt, and from the Mediterranean Sea to the Niger River in West Africa.  Historically, they spoke Berber languages, which together form the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic family.  Since the Muslim conquest of North Africa in the seventh century, a large number of Berbers inhabiting the Maghreb (Tamazgha) have in varying degrees used as lingua franca the other languages spoken in North Africa. 

Temple<====>48134<====>Temple  A temple (from the Latin word  ) is a structure reserved for religious or spiritual rituals and activities such as prayer and sacrifice.   It is typically used for such buildings belonging to all faiths where a more specific term such as church, mosque or synagogue is not generally used in English.   These include Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism among religions with many modern followers, as well as other ancient religions such as Ancient Egyptian religion. The form and function of temples is thus very variable, though they are often considered by believers to be in some sense the "house" of one or more deities. 

Amazon rainforest<====>48139<====>Amazon rainforest    The Amazon rainforest (Portuguese:   or  ;  ,   or usually  ;  ;  ), also known in English as Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle, is a moist broadleaf forest in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America.  This basin encompasses  , of which   are covered by the rainforest.  This region includes territory belonging to nine nations.  The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. 

Proxy ARP<====>48143<====>Proxy ARPProxy ARP is a technique by which a device on a given network answers the ARP queries for an IP address that is not on that network.  The ARP proxy is aware of the location of the traffic's destination, and offers its own MAC address as (ostensibly final) destination.   The traffic directed to the proxied IP address is then typically routed by the proxy to the intended destination via another interface or via a tunnel. The process, which results in the node responding with its own MAC address to an ARP request for a different IP address for proxying purposes, is sometimes referred to as 'publishing'. 

Microcomputer<====>48144<====>Microcomputer  A microcomputer is a small, relatively inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its central processing unit (CPU).   It includes a microprocessor, memory, and minimal input/output (I/O) circuitry mounted on a single printed circuit board.   Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors.  The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the IBM System z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs).  Many microcomputers (when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output) are also personal computers (in the generic sense). 

Bebop<====>48145<====>Bebop  Bebop or bop is a style of jazz developed in the early to mid-1940s in the United States, which features songs characterized by a fast tempo, complex chord progressions with rapid chord changes and numerous changes of key, instrumental virtuosity, and improvisation based on a combination of harmonic structure, the use of scales and occasional references to the melody. Bebop developed as the younger generation of jazz musicians expanded the creative possibilities of jazz beyond the popular, dance-oriented swing style with a new "musician's music" that was not as danceable and demanded close listening.

Fossil fuel<====>48146<====>Fossil fuel  A fossil fuel is a fuel formed by natural processes, such as anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms, containing energy originating in ancient photosynthesis.The age of the organisms and their resulting fossil fuels is typically millions of years, and sometimes exceeds 650 million years.   Fossil fuels contain high percentages of carbon and include petroleum, coal, and natural gas.    Other commonly used derivatives include kerosene and propane.  Fossil fuels range from volatile materials with low carbon to hydrogen ratios like methane, to liquids like petroleum, to nonvolatile materials composed of almost pure carbon, like anthracite coal. 

Art rock<====>48147<====>Art rock    Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements.  Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement,  opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music.  "Art Rock".  Encyclopædia Britannica.  Retrieved 15 December 2011.   Influences may be drawn from genres such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz.  Its music was created with the intention of listening and contemplation rather than for dancing,  and is often distinguished by the use of electronic effects and easy listening textures far removed from the propulsive rhythms of early rock. 

Commodity money<====>48152<====>Commodity moneyCommodity money is money whose value comes from a commodity of which it is made.  Commodity money consists of objects that have value in themselves (intrinsic value) as well as value in their use as money.  Example of commodities that have been used as mediums of exchange include gold, silver, copper, salt, peppercorns, tea, large stones (such as Rai stones), decorated belts, shells, alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, candy, nails, cocoa beans, cowries and barley.  These items were sometimes used in a metric of perceived value in conjunction to one another, in various commodity valuation or price system economies. 

Marion Tinsley<====>48162<====>Marion Tinsley Marion Franklin Tinsley (February 3, 1927 – April 3, 1995) was an American mathematician and checkers player.  He is considered to be the greatest checkers player who ever lived.   Tinsley was world champion from 1955–1958 and 1975–1991 and never lost a World Championship match, and lost only seven games (two of them to the Chinook computer program) in his 45-year career.He withdrew from championship play during the years 1958–1975, relinquishing the title during that time.   It was said that Tinsley was "to checkers what Leonardo da Vinci was to science, what Michelangelo was to art and what Beethoven was to music. 

Walter Hellman<====>48163<====>Walter Hellman Walter F.  Hellman  (June 15, 1916 – July 28, 1975) was the longest reigning world American checkers champion. BackgroundWalter Oskar Fredrik Hellman was born in Gamla Nordsjö, Nordmaling, Sweden.  His family moved to Gary, Indiana, United States, in 1926.  CareerHellman first entered at the age of fifteen and won a Gary City chess tournament.  He won his first Indiana State Tournament in 1933 at the age of seventeen.  Hellman placed 10th in the masters’ level at a young age of 18.  Three years later, in the 9th American tournament of 1937 held at Martins Ferry, Ohio, Hellman placed third in the checkers. 

Maximal ideal<====>48164<====>Maximal idealIn mathematics, more specifically in ring theory, a maximal ideal is an ideal that is maximal (with respect to set inclusion) amongst all proper ideals.    In other words, I is a maximal ideal of a ring R if there are no other ideals contained between I and R. Maximal ideals are important because the quotient rings of maximal ideals are simple rings, and in the special case of unital commutative rings they are also fields. In noncommutative ring theory, a maximal right ideal is defined analogously as being a maximal element in the poset of proper right ideals, and similarly, a maximal left ideal is defined to be a maximal element of the poset of proper left ideals.

Congruence relation<====>48167<====>Congruence relation  In abstract algebra, a congruence relation (or simply congruence) is an equivalence relation on an algebraic structure (such as a group, ring, or vector space) that is compatible with the structure.    Every congruence relation has a corresponding quotient structure, whose elements are the equivalence classes (or congruence classes) for the relation.  Basic example The prototypical example of a congruence relation is congruence modulo  n  on the set of integers.   For a given positive integer  n , two integers  a  and  b  are called congruent modulo  n , written a \equiv b \pmod{n} if  a - b  is divisible by  n  (or equivalently if  a  and  b  have the same remainder when divided by  n ). 

Adrienne Rich<====>48171<====>Adrienne Rich Adrienne Cecile Rich ( ;  May 16, 1929 – March 27, 2012) was an American poet, essayist and radical feminist.  She was called "one of the most widely read and influential poets of the second half of the 20th century",   and was credited with bringing "the oppression of women and lesbians to the forefront of poetic discourse. " Her first collection of poetry, A Change of World, was selected by renowned poet W.  H.  Auden for the Yale Series of Younger Poets Award.  Auden went on to write the introduction to the published volume.

Humanoid robot<====>48180<====>Humanoid robotA humanoid robot is a robot with its body shape built to resemble the human body.  The design may be for functional purposes, such as interacting with human tools and environments, for experimental purposes, such as the study of al locomotion, or for other purposes.  In general, humanoid robots have a torso, a head, two arms, and two legs, though some forms of humanoid robots may model only part of the body, for example, from the waist up.  Some humanoid robots also have heads designed to replicate human facial features such as eyes and mouths.  Androids are humanoid robots built to aesthetically resemble humans. 

Liberation Army of Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac<====>48186<====>Liberation Army of Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac The Liberation Army of Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac ( , UÇPMB) was an Albanian militant group fighting for separation from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for three municipalities: Preševo, Bujanovac, and Medveđa, home to most of the Albanians in south Serbia, adjacent to Kosovo. UÇPMB's uniforms, procedures and tactics mirrored those of the then freshly disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).  The 1,500-strong paramilitary launched the insurgency in the Preševo Valley from 1999 to 2001, with the goal of seceding these municipalities from Yugoslavia and joining them to the protectorate of Kosovo.The EU condemned what it described as the "extremism" and use of "illegal terrorist actions" by the group. 

William Ramsay<====>48187<====>William Ramsay    Sir William Ramsay   ( ; 2 October 1852 – 23 July 1916) was a British chemist who discovered the noble gases and received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1904 "in recognition of his services in the discovery of the inert gaseous elements in air" (along with his collaborator, John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics that same year for their discovery of argon).  After the two men identified argon, Ramsay investigated other atmospheric gases.  His work in isolating argon, helium, neon, krypton and xenon led to the development of a new section of the periodic table.

Commodity market<====>48190<====>Commodity market   A commodity market is a market that trades in primary economic sector rather than manufactured products.  Soft commodities are agricultural products such as wheat, coffee, cocoa, fruit and sugar.  Hard commodities are mined, such as gold and oil.   Investors access about 50 major commodity markets worldwide with purely financial transactions increasingly outnumbering physical trades in which goods are delivered.  Futures contracts are the oldest way of investing in commodities.  Futures are secured by physical assets.   Commodity markets can include physical trading and derivatives trading using spot prices, forwards, futures, and options on futures.

Camera obscura<====>48193<====>Camera obscura Camera obscura (plural camera obscura or camera obscuras;   from Latin, meaning "dark room": camera "(vaulted) chamber or room," and obscura "darkened, dark"), also referred to as pinhole image, is the natural optical phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at the other side of a screen (or for instance a wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen as a reversed and inverted image (left to right and upside down) on a surface opposite to the opening.  The surroundings of the projected image have to be relatively dark for the image to be clear, so many historical camera obscura experiments were performed in dark rooms. 

National Liberation Army (Macedonia)<====>48197<====>National Liberation Army (Macedonia)   The National Liberation Army ( ;  ), also known as the Macedonian UÇK, is a militant  organization that operated in the Republic of Macedonia in 2001 and was closely associated  with the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). Following the 2001 Macedonian War, it is believed it was disarmed under the terms of the Ohrid Agreement, under which greater rights and autonomy were to be given to the state's Macedonian Albanians.

Article (grammar)<====>48203<====>Article (grammar)   An article  (with the linguistic glossing abbreviation  ) is a word that is used with a noun (as a standalone word or a prefix or suffix) to specify grammatical definiteness of the noun, and in some languages extending to volume or numerical scope. The articles in English grammar are the and a/an, and in certain contexts some.  "An" and "a" are modern forms of the Old English "an", which in Anglian dialects was the number "one" (compare "on" in Saxon dialects) and survived into Modern Scots as the number "owan".  Both "on" (respelled "one" by the Norman language) and "an" survived into Modern English, with "one" used as the number and "an" ("a", before nouns that begin with a consonant sound) as an indefinite article. 

Allan Pinkerton<====>48204<====>Allan Pinkerton  Allan J.  Pinkerton (25 August 1819 – 1 July 1884) was a Scottish American detective and spy, best known for creating the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. Early life, career and immigrationAllan Pinkerton was born in Gorbals, Glasgow, Scotland, to William Pinkerton and his wife, Isobel McQueen, on August 25, 1819.   He left school at the age of 10 after his father's death.  Pinkerton read voraciously and was largely self-educated.   A cooper by trade,  Pinkerton was active in the Scottish Chartist movement as a young man.   He secretly married Joan Carfrae (1822-1887) from Duddinston, then a singer, in Glasgow on 13 March 1842.

He is regarded as the father of colloid chemistry.  https://www. strath. ac. uk/media/ps/comms/itallstartedhere/Graham. pdf LifeGraham was born in Glasgow, and educated at Glasgow High School.  Graham's father was a successful textile manufacturer, and wanted his son to enter into the Church of Scotland.  Instead, defying his father's wishes, Graham became a student at the University of Glasgow in 1819. 

Gas laws<====>48209<====>Gas lawsThis article outlines the historical development of the laws describing ideal gases.  For a detailed description of the ideal gas laws and their further development see ideal gas law. The gas laws were developed at the end of the 18th century, when scientists began to realize that relationships between  pressure, volume and temperature of a sample of gas could be obtained which would hold to approximation for all gases.  Gases behave in a similar way over a wide variety of conditions because they all have molecules which are widely spaced, and the equation of state for an ideal gas is derived from kinetic theory. 

Golomb ruler<====>48211<====>Golomb ruler  In mathematics, a Golomb ruler is a set of marks at integer positions along an imaginary ruler such that no two pairs of marks are the same distance apart.  The number of marks on the ruler is its order, and the largest distance between two of its marks is its length.  Translation and reflection of a Golomb ruler are considered trivial, so the smallest mark is customarily put at 0 and the next mark at the smaller of its two possible values. The Golomb ruler was named for Solomon W.  Golomb and discovered independently by    and  . 

Ice cream<====>48212<====>Ice cream Ice cream (derived from earlier iced cream or cream ice ) is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert.  It is usually made from dairy products, such as milk and cream, and often combined with fruits or other ingredients and flavors.  It is typically sweetened with sugar or sugar substitutes.  Typically, flavourings and colourings are added in addition to stabilizers.  The mixture is stirred to incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming.  The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (   PersiaIn 400 BC, the Persians invented a special chilled food, made of rose water and vermicelli, which was served to royalty during summers. 

Commodity<====>48218<====>Commodity   In economics, a commodity is an economic good or service that has full or substantial fungibility: that is, the market treats instances of the good as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them.   The price of a commodity good is typically determined as a function of its market as a whole: well-established physical commodities have actively traded spot and derivative markets.  Most commodities are raw materials, basic resources, or agricultural products, such as iron ore, sugar, or rice.   EtymologyThe word commodity came into use in English in the 15th century, from the French commodité, "amenity, convenience". 

Torquato Tasso<====>48227<====>Torquato TassoTorquato Tasso ( ; 11 March 1544 – 25 April 1595) was an Italian poet of the 16th century, best known for his poem Gerusalemme liberata (Jerusalem Delivered, 1581), in which he depicts a highly imaginative version of the combats between Christians and Muslims at the end of the First Crusade, during the Siege of Jerusalem.  He suffered from mental illness and died a few days before he was due to be crowned as the king of poets by the Pope.  Until the beginning of the 20th century, Tasso remained one of the most widely read poets in Europe. 

Polychlorinated biphenyl<====>48230<====>Polychlorinated biphenyl A polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) is an organic chlorine compound with the formula C 12 H 10−x Cl x .   Polychlorinated biphenyls were once widely deployed as dielectric and coolant fluids in electrical apparatus, carbonless copy paper and in heat transfer fluids. Because of their longevity, PCBs are still widely in use, even though their manufacture has declined drastically since the 1960s, when a host of problems were identified.   Because of PCBs' environmental toxicity and classification as a persistent organic pollutant, PCB production was banned by the United States Congress in 1979 and by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2001. 

Phenyl group<====>48232<====>Phenyl groupIn organic chemistry, the phenyl group or phenyl ring is a cyclic group of atoms with the formula C 6 H 5 .  Phenyl groups are closely related to benzene and can be viewed as a benzene ring, minus a hydrogen, which may be replaced by some other element or compound to serve as a functional group.  Phenyl groups have six carbon atoms bonded together in a hexagonal planar ring, five of which are bonded to individual hydrogen atoms, with the remaining carbon bonded to a substituent.  Phenyl groups are commonplace in organic chemistry.Although often depicted with alternating double and single bonds, phenyl groups are chemically aromatic and show nearly equal bond lengths between carbon atoms in the ring. 

Dafydd ap Gwilym<====>48233<====>Dafydd ap Gwilym  Dafydd ap Gwilym (c.  1315/1320 – c.  1350/1370) is regarded as one of the leading Welsh poets and amongst the great poets of Europe in the Middle Ages.  (Dafydd ap Gwilym scholar R.  Geraint Gruffydd suggests c.  1315-c.  1350 as his dates; other scholars   place him a little later, c.  1320-c.  1370. )LifeTradition has it that he was born at Brogynin, Penrhyn-coch (at the time Llanbadarn Fawr parish), Ceredigion.  His father, Gwilym Gam, and mother, Ardudfyl, were both from noble families.  As one of noble birth it seems Dafydd did not belong to the guild of professional poets in medieval Wales, and yet the poetic tradition had been strong in his family for generations. 

Hedd Wyn<====>48234<====>Hedd Wyn    Hedd Wyn (born Ellis Humphrey Evans, 13 January 1887 31 July 1917) was a Welsh-language poet who was killed on the first day of the Battle of Passchendaele during World War I.  He was posthumously awarded the bard's chair at the 1917 National Eisteddfod.  Evans, who had been awarded several chairs for his poetry, was inspired to take the bardic name Hedd Wyn ( ) from the way sunlight penetrated the mist in the Meirionnydd valleys.  Born in the village of Trawsfynydd, North Wales, Evans wrote much of his poetry while working as a shepherd on his family's hill farm. 

Vaudeville<====>48235<====>Vaudeville Vaudeville ( ;  ) is a theatrical genre of variety entertainment.  It was especially popular in the United States and Canada from the early 1880s until the early 1930s.   A typical vaudeville performance was made up of a series of separate, unrelated acts grouped together on a common bill.  Types of acts have included popular and classical musicians, singers, dancers, comedians, trained animals, magicians, strongmen, female and male impersonators, acrobats, illustrated songs, jugglers, one-act plays or scenes from plays, athletes, lecturing celebrities, minstrels, and movies.  A vaudeville performer is often referred to as a "vaudevillian". 

Saunders Lewis<====>48236<====>Saunders LewisSaunders Lewis (born John Saunders Lewis) (15 October 1893 – 1 September 1985) was a Welsh poet, dramatist, historian, literary critic, and political activist.  He was a prominent Welsh nationalist and a founder of Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru (the National Party of Wales), later known as Plaid Cymru.  Lewis is usually acknowledged as one of the most prominent figures of 20th century Welsh-language literature.  Lewis was a 1970 Nobel nominee for literature, and in 2005 was 10th in a BBC Wales poll to name Wales's greatest-ever person.  Early lifeBorn into a Welsh family living in Wallasey, England, in 1893. 

Celestial sphere<====>48239<====>Celestial sphere In astronomy and navigation, the celestial sphere is an abstract sphere, with an arbitrarily large radius, that is concentric to Earth.  All objects in the sky can be conceived as being projected upon the inner surface of the celestial sphere, which may be centered on Earth or the observer.  If centered on the observer, half of the sphere would resemble a hemispherical screen over the observing location.  The celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy, allowing astronomers to specify the apparent positions of objects in the sky if their distances are unknown or irrelevant. 

R. A. Lafferty<====>48245<====>R.  A.  Lafferty Raphael Aloysius Lafferty (November 7, 1914 March 18, 2002) was an American science fiction and fantasy writer known for his original use of language, metaphor, and narrative structure,  as well as for his etymological wit.  He also wrote a set of four autobiographical novels, In a Green Tree; a history book, The Fall of Rome; and several novels of historical fiction. In March 2011, it was announced in Locus that the copyrights to 29 Lafferty novels and 225 short stories were up for sale. The literary estate was soon thereafter purchased by the magazine's nonprofit foundation, under the auspices of board member Neil Gaiman. 

Semidirect product<====>48246<====>Semidirect product In mathematics, specifically in group theory, the concept of a semidirect product is a generalization of a direct product.  There are two closely related concepts of semidirect product: an inner semidirect product is a particular way in which a group can be constructed from two subgroups, one of which is a normal subgroup, while an outer semidirect product is a Cartesian product as a set, but with a particular multiplication operation.  As with direct products, there is a natural equivalence between inner and outer semidirect products, and both are commonly referred to simply as semidirect products.

Fractal art<====>48253<====>Fractal artFractal art is a form of algorithmic art created by calculating fractal objects and representing the calculation results as still images, animations, and media.  Fractal art developed from the mid-1980s onwards.It is a genre of computer art and digital art which are part of new media art.  The mathematical beauty of fractals lies at the intersection of generative art and computer art.   They combine to produce a type of abstract art. Fractal art (especially in the western world) is rarely drawn or painted by hand.  It is usually created indirectly with the assistance of fractal-generating software, iterating through three phases: setting parameters of appropriate fractal software; executing the possibly lengthy calculation; and evaluating the product.

Random sequence<====>48256<====>Random sequenceThe concept of a random sequence is essential in probability theory and statistics.  The concept generally relies on the notion of a sequence of random variables and many statistical discussions begin with the words "let X 1 ,. . . ,X n  be independent random variables. . . ".  Yet as D.  H.  Lehmer stated in 1951: "A random sequence is a vague notion. . .  in which each term is unpredictable to the uninitiated and whose digits pass a certain number of tests traditional with statisticians".  Axiomatic probability theory deliberately avoids a definition of a random sequence. 

Fredric Brown<====>48257<====>Fredric Brown  Fredric Brown (October 29, 1906 – March 11, 1972 ) was an American science fiction and mystery writer.  D.  J.  McReynolds, "The Short Fiction of Fredric Brown" in Frank N.  Magill, (ed. ) Survey of Science Fiction Literature, Vol.  4.  Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, 1979.  (pp.  1954-1957).He is  known for his use of humor and for his mastery of the "short short" form—stories of 1 to 3 pages, often with ingenious plotting devices and surprise endings.  Humor and a somewhat postmodern outlook carried over into his novels as well. 

Bounded set<====>48258<====>Bounded set"Bounded" and "boundary" are distinct concepts; for the latter see boundary (topology).  A circle in isolation is a boundaryless bounded set, while the half plane is unbounded yet has a boundary. In mathematical analysis and related areas of mathematics, a set is called bounded, if it is, in a certain sense, of finite size.  Conversely, a set which is not bounded is called unbounded.  The word bounded makes no sense in a general topological space without a corresponding metric. DefinitionA set S of real numbers is called bounded from above if there is a real number k such that k ≥  s for all s in S. 

Monotonic function<====>48260<====>Monotonic function   In mathematics, a monotonic function  (or monotone function) is a function between ordered sets that preserves or reverses the given order.  This concept first arose in calculus, and was later generalized to the more abstract setting of order theory. Monotonicity in calculus and analysisIn calculus, a function  f  defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called  monotonic if and only if it is either entirely non-increasing, or entirely non-decreasing.  That is, as per Fig.  1, a function that increases monotonically does not exclusively have to increase, it simply must not decrease. 

Ben Jonson<====>48261<====>Ben Jonson    Benjamin Jonson (c.  11 June 1572 – 6 August 1637 ) was an English playwright, poet, actor, and literary critic, whose artistry exerted a lasting impact upon English poetry and stage comedy.  He popularised the comedy of humours.  He is best known for the satirical plays Every Man in His Humour (1598), Volpone, or The Fox (c.  1606), The Alchemist (1610) and Bartholomew Fair (1614) and for his lyric and epigrammatic poetry; he is generally regarded as the second most important English playwright during the reign of James VI and I after William Shakespeare. 

Representative money<====>48266<====>Representative moneyRepresentative money is any medium of exchange that represents something of value, but has little or no value of its own (intrinsic value).  However, unlike some forms of fiat money (which may not have anything of value backing it), to be a genuine representative money, there must always be something valuable supporting the face value represented.  More specifically, the term representative money has been used variously to mean:A claim on a commodity, for example gold certificates or silver certificates.  Robert A.

Khalil el-Moumni<====>48272<====>Khalil el-MoumniKhalil el-Moumni (born 1 July 1941, Beni Mansour, Morocco) is a Moroccan imam who preaches at the An-Nasr Mosque in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.   He has been a center of controversy for his views on homosexuality, which brought him into open conflict with the Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn. In Morocco he had been banned several times for – how he explains himself – for speaking about injustice in the society.  On 3 May 2001, he appeared on the Dutch television program Nova to discuss the rising incidence of anti-homosexual violence by Moroccan youths.   He said that "if the sickness of homosexuality spreads itself, everyone can become infected". 

Canterbury<====>48274<====>Canterbury    Canterbury ( ,  , or  )  is a historic English cathedral city and UNESCO World Heritage Site, which lies at the heart of the City of Canterbury, a local government district of Kent, England.  It lies on the River Stour. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the primate of the Church of England and the worldwide Anglican Communion owing to the importance of St Augustine, who served as the apostle to the pagan Kingdom of Kent around the turn of the 7th century.  The city's cathedral became a major focus of pilgrimage following the 1170 martyrdom of Thomas Becket, although it had already been a well-trodden pilgrim destination since the murder of St Alphege by the men of King Canute in 1012. 

History of the State of Palestine<====>48276<====>History of the State of Palestine   The history of the State of Palestine describes the creation and evolution of the State of Palestine in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. During the Mandatory period, numerous plans of partition of Palestine were proposed but without the agreement of all parties.  In 1947, the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was voted.  This triggered the 1948 Palestine war, which established a Jewish state but no Palestinian state.   Since then there have been proposals to establish a Palestinian state.  In 1969, for example, the PLO proposed the establishment of a binational state over the whole of the former British Mandate territory. 

Daniel Schultz<====>48280<====>Daniel Schultz Jerzy (Georg) Daniel Schultz   known also as Daniel Schultz the Younger (1615–1683) was a famous painter  of the Baroque era, born and active in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.   He painted many Polish and Lithuanian nobles, members of the royal family, local Patricians, such as the astronomer Johannes Hevelius; animals, and hunts.  His work can be found at the Wawel Castle State Art Collections, the National Museum in Warsaw, the Stockholm National Museum, the Hermitage Museum, and at the Gdańsk National Museum.    Life and professional careerBorn somewhere around 1615 in Danzig (Gdańsk),  in Polish Prussia,  a part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Schultz learned the art of painting from his uncle, Daniel Schultz the Elder, another important painter, working in his workshop for about five years.

In Soviet/Russian nomenclature, aircraft from Ilyushin are prefixed Il.  The head office of Ilyushin is located in Aeroport District, Northern Administrative Okrug, Moscow.  HistoryIlyushin was established under the Soviet Union.  Its operations began on 13 January 1933, by order of P.  I.  Baranov, People's Commissar of the Heavy Industry and the Head of the Main Department of Aviation Industry. In 2006 the Russian government merged Ilyushin with Mikoyan, Irkut, Sukhoi, Tupolev, and Yakovlev under a new company named United Aircraft Corporation. 

International auxiliary language<====>48294<====>International auxiliary languageAn international auxiliary language  (sometimes abbreviated as IAL or auxlang) or interlanguage is a language meant for communication between people from different nations who do not share a common first language.  An auxiliary language is primarily a second language. Languages of dominant societies over the centuries have served as auxiliary languages, sometimes approaching the international level.  Latin, Greek and the Mediterranean Lingua Franca were used in the past, and Arabic, English, French, Russian, Spanish, and Standard Chinese have been used as such in recent times in many parts of the world.

Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki<====>48295<====>Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki Michael I ( ,  ; May 31,  1640 – November 10, 1673) was the ruler of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania from September 29, 1669 until his death in 1673.  Michael's reign was marked by struggles between the pro-Habsburg and pro-French political factions.  A native Pole and descendant of Korybut, brother of King Władysław II Jagiełło, Michael was freely elected by the unanimous vote of the Polish nobility after the abdication of his predecessor, John II Casimir Vasa.  Chosen partly because of the merit of his father, prince Jeremi Wiśniowiecki, a powerful border magnate who had helped suppress the Cossacks in eastern Poland during the Khmelnytsky Uprising, Michael proved to be a passive tool in the hands of the Habsburgs. 

Marburg<====>48296<====>Marburg   Marburg is a university town in the German federal state (Bundesland) of Hesse, capital of the Marburg-Biedenkopf district (Landkreis).  The town area spreads along the valley of the river Lahn and has a population of approximately 72,000. Having been awarded town privileges in 1222, Marburg served as capital of the landgraviate of Hessen-Marburg during periods of the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries.  The University of Marburg was founded in 1527 and dominates the public life in the town to this day. HistoryFounding and early historyLike many settlements, Marburg developed at the crossroads of two important early medieval highways: the trade route linking Cologne and Prague and the trade route from the North Sea to the Alps and on to Italy, the former crossing the river Lahn here. 

John III Sobieski<====>48303<====>John III Sobieski   John III Sobieski ( ;  ;  ; 17 August 1629 – 17 June 1696), was King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1674 until his death, and one of the most notable monarchs of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Sobieski's military skill, demonstrated in wars against the Ottoman Empire, contributed to his prowess as King of Poland.  Sobieski's 22-year reign marked a period of the Commonwealth's stabilization, much needed after the turmoil of the Deluge and the Khmelnytsky Uprising.   Popular among his subjects, he was an able military commander, most famous for his victory over the Turks at the 1683 Battle of Vienna. 

Dartmouth Dam<====>48308<====>Dartmouth Dam   Dartmouth Dam is a large rock-fill embankment dam with an uncontrolled chute spillway across the Mitta Mitta, Gibbo, and Dart rivers, the Morass Creek and a number of small tributaries.  The dam is located near Mount Bogong in the north-east of the Australian state of Victoria.  The dam's purpose includes irrigation, the generation of hydro-electric power, water supply and conservation.  The impounded reservoir is called Dartmouth Reservoir, sometimes called Lake Dartmouth.  The Dartmouth Power Station, a hydro-electric power station that generates power to the national grid, is located near the dam wall. 

Algebraic notation (chess)<====>48309<====>Algebraic notation (chess)Algebraic notation (or AN) is a method for recording and describing the moves in a game of chess.  It is based on a system of coordinates to uniquely identify each square on the chessboard.  It is now standard among all chess organizations and most books, magazines, and newspapers.  In English-speaking countries, the parallel method of descriptive notation was generally used in chess publications until about 1980.  Some older players still use descriptive notation, but it is no longer recognized by FIDE. Algebraic notation exists in various forms and languages and is based on a system developed by Philipp Stamma. 

Milk bar<====>48310<====>Milk bar  In Australia, a milk bar is a suburban local general store or café.  Similar terms include tuck shops, delicatessens or "delis",  and corner shops or corner stores (although by definition these are different establishments).  Milk bars are traditionally a place where people pick up newspapers, and fast-food items like fish and chips and hamburgers, and where people can purchase milkshakes or lollies. History The first business using the name "milk bar" was started in India in 1930 by an Englishman, James Meadow Charles when he opened "Lake View Milk Bar" at Bangalore.  The concept soon spread to the United Kingdom, where it was encouraged by the Temperance Society as a morally acceptable alternative to the pub, and over 1,000 milk bars had opened nationally by the end of 1936. 

Iguazu Falls<====>48312<====>Iguazu Falls   The Iguazu Falls, Iguazú Falls, Iguassu Falls, or Iguaçu Falls (   ;    ;    ) are waterfalls of the Iguazu River on the border of the Argentine province of Misiones and the Brazilian state of Paraná.  They are the largest waterfalls system in the world.   The falls divide the river into the upper and lower Iguazu.  The Iguazu River rises near the city of Curitiba.  For most of its course, the river flows through Brazil; however, most of the falls are on the Argentine side. 

Baltimore–Washington International Airport<====>48314<====>Baltimore–Washington International Airport   Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport   is an international airport located in Linthicum,  an unincorporated community in northern Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States.  The airport is   south of downtown Baltimore  and   northeast of Washington, D. C.   It is the busiest, by passenger count, of three major airports serving the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area, the other two being Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport.  It is commonly referred to as BWI or BWI Marshall.   The airport is named after Thurgood Marshall, a Baltimore native who was the first African American to be a judge on the Supreme Court of the United States. 

Hans Holbein the Elder<====>48315<====>Hans Holbein the Elder  Hans Holbein the Elder (c.  1460 – 1524) was a German painter.  LifeHolbein was born in free imperial city of Augsburg (Germany), and died in Isenheim, Alsace (now France).  He belonged to a celebrated family of painters; his father was Michael Holbein; his brother was Sigmund Holbein (died 1540).  He had two sons, both artists and printmakers: Ambrosius Holbein (c.  1494 – c.  1519) and Hans Holbein the Younger (c.  1497 – 1543), who both had their first painting lessons from their father. The date of Holbein's birth is unknown. 

Ambrosius Holbein<====>48316<====>Ambrosius Holbein Ambrosius Holbein (c.  1494 – c.  1519) was a German and Swiss artist in painting, drawing and printmaking.  He was the elder brother, by about three years, of Hans Holbein the Younger, but he appears to have died in his mid twenties leaving behind only a small body of work. BiographyLike his younger brother, he was born in Augsburg (which today is in Bavaria, but then was a free imperial city), a center of art, culture and trade at that time.  His father Hans Holbein the Elder was a pioneer and leader in the transformation of German art from the Gothic to the Renaissance style. 

Lagomorpha<====>48317<====>Lagomorpha The lagomorphs are the members of the taxonomic order Lagomorpha, of which there are two living families: the Leporidae (hares and rabbits) and the Ochotonidae (pikas).  The name of the order is derived from the Ancient Greek lagos (λαγώς, "hare") +morphē (μορφή, "form").  There are about eighty-seven species of lagomorph, including about twenty-nine species of pika, twenty-eight species of rabbit and cottontail, and thirty species of hare.  Lagomorphs share a common ancestor with rodents, together forming the clade Glires (Latin: “dormice”).  Like the ancestors of most modern mammalian groups, this most recent common ancestor lived after the last great extinction event, the one 66 million years ago that drove all dinosaurs extinct except for birds. 

Columbia, Maryland<====>48318<====>Columbia, Maryland Columbia is a census-designated place in Howard County, Maryland, United States, and is one of the principal cities of the Baltimore metropolitan area.  It is a planned community consisting of 10 self-contained villages.  It began with the idea that a city could enhance its residents' quality of life.  Creator and developer James W.  Rouse saw the new community in terms of human values, rather than merely economics and engineering.  Opened in 1967, Columbia was intended to not only eliminate the inconveniences of then-current subdivision design, but also eliminate racial, religious, and class segregation. 

Andrew Marvell<====>48319<====>Andrew Marvell   Andrew Marvell ( ; 31 March 1621 – 16 August 1678) was an English metaphysical poet, satirist and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1659 and 1678.  During the Commonwealth period he was a colleague and friend of John Milton.  His poems range from the love-song "To His Coy Mistress", to evocations  of an aristocratic country house and garden in "Upon Appleton House" and "The Garden", the political address "An Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland", and the later personal and political satires "Flecknoe" and "The Character of Holland". 

Hans Holbein the Younger<====>48321<====>Hans Holbein the Younger   Hans Holbein the Younger ( ) (   – between 7 October and 29 November 1543) was a German and Swiss artist and printmaker who worked in a Northern Renaissance style.  He is best known as one of the greatest portraitists of the 16th century.   He also produced religious art, satire and Reformation propaganda, and made a significant contribution to the history of book design.  He is called "the Younger" to distinguish him from his father, Hans Holbein the Elder, an accomplished painter of the Late Gothic school. Born in Augsburg, Holbein worked mainly in Basel as a young artist. 

Albrecht Giese<====>48326<====>Albrecht Giese Albrecht Giese (February 10, 1524 – August 1, 1580) was a councilman and diplomat of the city of Danzig (Gdańsk). Giese was born in Danzig, Royal Prussia, Poland, to the influential and wealthy merchant Patrician family Giese.  His relatives were the bishop Tiedemann Giese, and the merchant Georg Giese, who also worked in the Hanse base in London, the Steelyard. Albrecht studied at the Universities of Greifswald, Wittenberg and Heidelberg.  As was the custom of the time for Hanseatic merchants, he toured Europe for several years to learn different languages after his formal studies, as was necessary for a long-distance trader. 

Celestial pole<====>48329<====>Celestial pole The north and south celestial poles are the two imaginary points in the sky where the Earth's axis of rotation, indefinitely extended, intersects the celestial sphere.  The north and south celestial poles appear permanently directly overhead to an observer at the Earth's North Pole and South Pole, respectively.  As the Earth spins on its axis, the two celestial poles remain fixed in the sky, and all other points appear to rotate around them, completing one circuit per day (strictly, per sidereal day). The celestial poles are also the poles of the celestial equatorial coordinate system, meaning they have declinations of +90 degrees and −90 degrees (for the north and south celestial poles, respectively). 

Measure word<====>48331<====>Measure word In linguistics, measure words are words (or morphemes) that are used in combination with a numeral to indicate an amount of something represented by some noun.  DescriptionMeasure words denote a unit or measurement and are used with mass nouns (uncountable nouns), and in some cases also with count nouns.  For instance, in English,   is a mass noun and thus one cannot say "three muds", but one can say "three  drops  of mud", "three  pails  of mud", etc.  In these examples, drops and pails function as measure words.  One can also say "three  pails  of shells"; in this case the measure word pails accompanies a count noun (shells). 

Retina<====>48334<====>Retina    The retina is the third and inner coat of the eye which is a light-sensitive layer of tissue.   The optics of the eye create an image of the visual world on the retina (through the cornea and lens), which serves much the same function as the film in a camera.  Light striking the retina initiates a cascade of chemical and electrical events that ultimately trigger nerve impulses.  These are sent to various visual centres of the brain through the fibres of the optic nerve.  Neural retina typically refers to three layers of neural cells (photo receptor cells, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells) within the retina, while the entire retina refers to these three layers plus a layer of pigmented epithelial cells. 

Electrolyte<====>48336<====>Electrolyte An electrolyte is a substance that produces an electrically conducting solution when dissolved in a polar solvent, such as water.  The dissolved electrolyte separates into cations and anions, which disperse uniformly through the solvent.  Electrically, such a solution is neutral.  If an electric potential is applied to such a solution, the cations of the solution are drawn to the electrode that has an abundance of electrons, while the anions are drawn to the electrode that has a deficit of electrons.  The movement of anions and cations in opposite directions within the solution amounts to a current. 

Caterpillar<====>48337<====>Caterpillar   Caterpillars    are the larval stage of members of the order Lepidoptera (the insect order comprising butterflies and moths). As with most common names, the application of the word is arbitrary and the larvae of sawflies commonly are called caterpillars as well.   Both lepidopteran and symphytan larvae have eruciform body shapes. Caterpillars of most species are herbivorous, but not all; some (about 1%) are insectivorous, even cannibalistic.  Some feed on other animal products; for example clothes moths feed on wool, and horn moths feed on the hooves and horns of dead ungulates. 

Butterfly<====>48338<====>Butterfly  Butterflies are insects in the macrolepidopteran clade Rhopalocera from the order Lepidoptera, which also includes moths.  Adult butterflies have large, often brightly coloured wings, and conspicuous, fluttering flight.  The group comprises the large superfamily Papilionoidea, which contains at least one former group, the skippers (formerly the superfamily "Hesperioidea") and the most recent analyses suggest it also contains the moth-butterflies (formerly the superfamily "Hedyloidea").  Butterfly fossils date to the Paleocene, which was about 56 million years ago. Butterflies have the typical four-stage insect life cycle.  Winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on which their larvae, known as caterpillars, will feed. 

Parachute<====>48339<====>Parachute A  parachute is a device used to slow the motion of an object through an atmosphere by creating drag (or in the case of ram-air parachutes, aerodynamic lift).  Parachutes are usually made out of light, strong fabric, originally silk, now most commonly nylon.   They are typically dome-shaped, but vary, with rectangles, inverted domes, and others found.  A variety of loads are attached to parachutes, including people, food, equipment, space capsules, and bombs. A drogue chute is used to aid horizontal deceleration of a vehicle such as fixed-wing aircraft and drag racer); provide stability, as to certain types of light aircraft in distress,   tandem free-fall; and as a pilot triggering deployment a larger parachute. 

Pesticide<====>48340<====>Pesticide Pesticides are substances that are meant to control pests (including weeds).   The term pesticide includes all of the following: herbicide, insecticides (which may include insect growth regulators, termiticides, etc. ) nematicide, molluscicide, piscicide, avicide, rodenticide, bactericide, insect repellent, animal repellent, antimicrobial, fungicide, disinfectant (antimicrobial), and sanitizer.   The most common of these are herbicides which account for approximately 80% of all pesticide use.   Most pesticides are intended to serve as plant protection products (also known as crop protection products), which in general, protect plants from weeds, fungi, or insects. In general, a pesticide is a chemical or biological agent (such as a virus, bacterium, or fungus) that deters, incapacitates, kills, or otherwise discourages pests. 

Tripartite Pact<====>48343<====>Tripartite Pact  The Tripartite Pact, also known as the Berlin Pact, was an agreement between Germany, Italy and Japan  signed in Berlin on 27 September 1940 by, respectively, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Galeazzo Ciano and Saburō Kurusu.  It was a defensive military alliance that was eventually joined by Hungary (20 November 1940), Romania (23 November 1940), Bulgaria (1 March 1941) and Yugoslavia (25 March 1941), as well as by the German client state of Slovakia (24 November 1940).   Yugoslavia's accession provoked a coup d'état in Belgrade two days later, and Italy and Germany responded by invading Yugoslavia (with Bulgarian, Hungarian and Romanian assistance) and partitioning the country. 

Alexander Pope<====>48344<====>Alexander PopeAlexander Pope (21 May 1688 – 30 May 1744) was an 18th-century English poet.  He is best known for his satirical verse, his translation of Homer and for his use of the heroic couplet.   He is the second-most frequently quoted writer in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations after Shakespeare.  LifeEarly lifeAlexander Pope was born to  Alexander Pope Senior (1646–1717), a linen merchant of Plough Court, Lombard Street, London, and his wife Edith (née Turner) (1643–1733), who were both Catholics.  Erskine-Hill, DNB  Edith's sister Christiana was the wife of the famous miniature painter Samuel Cooper. 

Irving Berlin<====>48351<====>Irving Berlin  Irving Berlin (born Israel Beilin; May 11, 1888 – September 22, 1989) was an American composer and lyricist, widely considered one of the greatest songwriters in American history.  His music forms a great part of the Great American Songbook.  Born in Imperial Russia, Berlin arrived in the United States at the age of five.  He published his first song, "Marie from Sunny Italy", in 1907, receiving 33 cents for the publishing rights, Starr, Larry and Waterman, Christopher, American Popular Music: From Minstrelsy to MP3, Oxford University Press, 2009, pg.  64    and had his first major international hit, "Alexander's Ragtime Band" in 1911. 

Le Pétomane<====>48352<====>Le PétomaneLe Pétomane ( ,  ) was the stage name of the French flatulist (professional farter) and entertainer Joseph Pujol (June 1, 1857 – 1945).  He was famous for his remarkable control of the abdominal muscles, which enabled him to seemingly fart at will.  His stage name combines the French verb péter, "to fart" with the -mane, "-maniac" suffix, which translates to "fartomaniac".   The profession is also referred to as "flatulist", "farteur", or "fartiste".  Le Pétomane: The Strange Life of a "Fartiste" Accessed 2012-02-02 It is a common misconception that Joseph Pujol actually passed intestinal gas as part of his stage performance. 

Leonard Rossiter<====>48353<====>Leonard Rossiter Leonard Rossiter (21 October 1926 – 5 October 1984) was an English actor.  He had a long career in the theatre but achieved his greatest fame for his television comedy roles, most notably starring as Rupert Rigsby in the ITV series Rising Damp from 1974 to 1980, and Reginald Perrin in the BBC's The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin from 1976 to 1979.  Early life and stage workRossiter was born on 21 October 1926 in Wavertree, Liverpool, the second son of Elizabeth (née Howell) and John Rossiter. The family lived over the barber shop owned by his father. 

Substitution cipher<====>48356<====>Substitution cipher In cryptography, a substitution cipher is a method of encrypting by which units of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext, according to a fixed system; the "units" may be single letters (the most common), pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth.  The receiver deciphers the text by performing the inverse substitution. Substitution ciphers can be compared with transposition ciphers.  In a transposition cipher, the units of the plaintext are rearranged in a different and usually quite complex order, but the units themselves are left unchanged.  By contrast, in a substitution cipher, the units of the plaintext are retained in the same sequence in the ciphertext, but the units themselves are altered. 

Transposition cipher<====>48358<====>Transposition cipher In cryptography, a transposition cipher is a method of encryption by which the positions held by units of plaintext (which are commonly characters or groups of characters) are shifted according to a regular system, so that the ciphertext constitutes a permutation of the plaintext.  That is, the order of the units is changed (the plaintext is reordered).  Mathematically a bijective function is used on the characters' positions to encrypt and an inverse function to decrypt. Following are some implementations. Rail Fence cipherThe Rail Fence cipher is a form of transposition cipher that gets its name from the way in which it is encoded. 

Geographic coordinate system<====>48361<====>Geographic coordinate system  A geographic coordinate system is a coordinate system used in geography that enables every location on Earth to be specified by a set of numbers, letters or symbols.  In specialized works, "geographic coordinates" are distinguished from other similar coordinate systems, such as geocentric coordinates and geodetic coordinates.  See, for example, Sean E.  Urban and P.  Kenneth Seidelmann, Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac, 3rd.  ed. , (Mill Valley CA: University Science Books, 2013) p.  20–23.   The coordinates are often chosen such that one of the numbers represents a vertical position, and two or three of the numbers represent a horizontal position. 

ROT13<====>48362<====>ROT13  ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places", sometimes hyphenated ROT-13) is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it, in the alphabet.  ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher, developed in ancient Rome. Because there are 26 letters (2×13) in the basic Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same algorithm is applied, so the same action can be used for encoding and decoding.  The algorithm provides virtually no cryptographic security, and is often cited as a canonical example of weak encryption.    ROT13 is used in online forums as a means of hiding spoilers, punchlines, puzzle solutions, and offensive materials from the casual glance. 

Software architecture<====>48364<====>Software architecture Software architecture refers to the high level structures of a software system, the discipline of creating such structures, and the documentation of these structures.  These structures are needed to reason about the software system.  Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations.The architecture of a software system is a metaphor, analogous to the architecture of a building.    Software architecture is about making fundamental structural choices which are costly to change once implemented.  Software architecture choices include specific structural options from possibilities in the design of software. 

Polyurethane<====>48366<====>PolyurethanePolyurethane (PUR and PU) is a polymer composed of organic units joined by carbamate (urethane) links.  While most polyurethanes are thermosetting polymers that do not melt when heated, thermoplastic polyurethanes are also available. Polyurethane polymers are traditionally and most commonly formed by reacting a di- or poly-isocyanate with a polyol.  Both the isocyanates and polyols used to make polyurethanes contain, on average, two or more functional groups per molecule. Some noteworthy recent efforts have been dedicated to minimizing the use of isocyanates  to synthesize polyurethanes, because the isocyanates raise severe toxicity issues.  Non-isocyanate based polyurethanes (NIPUs) have recently been developed as a new class of polyurethane polymers to mitigate health and environmental concerns. 

Westchester County, New York<====>48367<====>Westchester County, New York  Westchester County is a county in the U. S.  state of New York.  It is the second-most populous county on the mainland of New York, after the Bronx.According to the 2010 Census, the county had a population of 949,113, estimated to have increased by 2. 7% to 974,542 by 2016.   Situated in the Hudson Valley, Westchester covers an area of  , consisting of 6 cities, 19 towns, and 23 villages.  Established in 1683, Westchester was named after the city of Chester, England.    The county seat is the city of White Plains, while the most populous municipality in the county is the city of Yonkers, with an estimated 200,807 residents in 2016. 

Nassau County, New York<====>48369<====>Nassau County, New York    Nassau County   or   is a suburban county comprising much of the western half of Long Island in the U. S.  state of New York.  At the 2010 census, the county's population was 1,339,532, estimated to have increased to 1,361,500 in 2016.The county seat is in the Village of Garden City within the boundaries of the Mineola 11501 zip code.   Nassau County is directly east of New York City limits and therefore also within the New York metropolitan area. 

Jean-Pierre Abbat<====>48370<====>Jean-Pierre Abbat Jean-Pierre Fernand Noël Abbat (June 17, 1928 – August 1, 1993) was, with Dr.  Fritz Hartmann, the first person in the USA to manufacture polyurethane. Abbat was born in Le Trait, Normandy to a shipbuilder.  He met Marina Lardé at the Sorbonne and they were married, migrating to the United States in 1953. In 1962 Abbat proposed to Norman McCulloch to make a ballistically equivalent bowling pin out of polyurethane foam.  Bowling pins were then made out of wood, with two cylindrical voids, and covered with a thin coating.  The polyurethane pin would last much longer than the wooden pin  . 

Oscar Niemeyer<====>48372<====>Oscar Niemeyer   Oscar Ribeiro de Almeida Niemeyer Soares Filho (December 15, 1907 – December 5, 2012)—known as Oscar Niemeyer ( )—was a Brazilian architect considered to be one of the key figures in the development of modern architecture.  Niemeyer was best known for his design of civic buildings for Brasília, a planned city that became Brazil's capital in 1960, as well as his collaboration with other architects on the headquarters of the United Nations in New York.  His exploration of the aesthetic possibilities of reinforced concrete was highly influential in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. 

Triple DES<====>48375<====>Triple DES In cryptography, Triple DES (3DES), officially the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA or Triple DEA), is a symmetric-key block cipher, which applies the DES cipher algorithm three times to each data block. While the government and industry standards abbreviate the algorithm's name as TDES (Triple DES) and TDEA (Triple Data Encryption Algorithm),  RFC 1851 called it 3DES from the time it first promulgated the idea, and this namesake has since come into wide use by most vendors, users, and cryptographers.StandardsThe Triple Data Encryption Algorithm is variously defined in several standards documents:RFC 1851, The ESP Triple DES Transform  (approved in 1995)ANSI ANS X9. 

346 BC<====>48378<====>346 BC    Year 346 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Corvus and Visolus (or, less frequently, year 408 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 346 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placeGreeceThe Peace of Philocrates is signed between Macedonia and Athens.  The document agrees to a return to the status quo, but Philip II of Macedon keeps the right to punish the Phocians for starting the Sacred War. 

Circuit Paul Ricard<====>48379<====>Circuit Paul Ricard The Circuit Paul Ricard is a motorsport race track built in 1969 at Le Castellet, near Marseille, in France,  with finance from the eccentric pastis magnate Paul Ricard.  Ricard wanted to experience the challenge of building a racetrack. HistoryOpened on 19 April 1970,  its innovative facilities made it one of the safest motor racing circuits in the world at the time of its opening.   The circuit had three track layout permutations, a large industrial park and an airstrip.  The  combination of modern facilities, mild winter weather and an airstrip made it popular amongst racing teams for car testing during the annual winter off-season. 

Celestial coordinate system<====>48381<====>Celestial coordinate system  In astronomy, a celestial coordinate system is a system for specifying positions of celestial objects: satellites, planets, stars, galaxies, and so on.  Coordinate systems can specify an object's position in three-dimensional space or plot merely its direction on a celestial sphere, if the object's distance is unknown or trivial. The coordinate systems are implemented in either spherical or rectangular coordinates.  Spherical coordinates, projected on the celestial sphere, are analogous to the geographic coordinate system used on the surface of Earth.  These differ in their choice of fundamental plane, which divides the celestial sphere into two equal hemispheres along a great circle. 

Eudoxus<====>48382<====>EudoxusEudoxus may refer to:Eudoxus of Cnidus (c. 395–390 BC – c. 342–337 BC), Greek astronomer and mathematician, student of PlatoEudoxus of Cyzicus (fl. c. 130 BC), Greek navigator who explored the Arabian Sea for Ptolemy VIII of EgyptEudoxus (lunar crater)Eudoxus (Martian crater)See also11709 Eudoxos, asteroidEudoxia (name)Charaxes eudoxus, an African butterfly 

Equatorial coordinate system<====>48384<====>Equatorial coordinate systemThe equatorial coordinate system is a celestial coordinate system widely used to specify the positions of celestial objects.  It may be implemented in spherical or rectangular coordinates, both defined by an origin at the centre of Earth, a fundamental plane consisting of the projection of Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere (forming the celestial equator), a primary direction towards the vernal equinox, and a right-handed convention.  The origin at the centre of Earth means the coordinates are geocentric, that is, as seen from the centre of Earth as if it were transparent. 

Horizontal coordinate system<====>48386<====>Horizontal coordinate systemThe horizontal coordinate system is a celestial coordinate system that uses the observer's local horizon as the fundamental plane.  It is expressed in terms of altitude (or elevation) angle and azimuth. DefinitionThis coordinate system divides the sky into the upper hemisphere where objects are visible, and the lower hemisphere where objects cannot be seen since the Earth obstructs vision.  The great circle separating the hemispheres is called the celestial horizon.   The celestial horizon is defined as the great circle on the celestial sphere whose plane is normal to the local gravity vector.   In practice, the horizon can be defined as the plane tangent to a still liquid surface such as a pool of mercury. 

Ecliptic coordinate system<====>48387<====>Ecliptic coordinate system The ecliptic coordinate system is a celestial coordinate system commonly used for representing the apparent positions and orbits of Solar System objects.  Because most planets (except Mercury) and many small Solar System bodies have orbits with slight inclinations to the ecliptic, using it as thefundamental plane is convenient.  The system's origin can be the center of either the Sun or Earth, its primary direction is towards the vernal (northward) equinox, and it has a right-hand convention.  It may be implemented in spherical or rectangular coordinates.    Primary direction The celestial equator and the ecliptic are slowly moving due to perturbing forces on the Earth, therefore the orientation of the primary direction, their intersection at the Northern Hemisphere vernal equinox, is not quite fixed. 

Eudoxus of Cnidus<====>48388<====>Eudoxus of Cnidus  Eudoxus of Cnidus ( ;  , Eúdoxos ho Knídios; c.  390– c.  337 BC) was a Greek astronomer, mathematician, scholar and student of Plato.  All of his works are lost, though some fragments are preserved in Hipparchus' commentary on Aratus's poem on astronomy.   Theodosius of Bithynia's important work, Sphaerics, may be based on a work of Eudoxus. LifeHis name Eudoxus means "honored" or "of good repute" (in Ancient Greek εὔδοξος, from eu "good" and doxa "opinion, belief, fame").  It is analogous to the Latin name  . Eudoxus's father Aeschines of Cnidus loved to watch stars at night. 

Galactic coordinate system<====>48389<====>Galactic coordinate system The galactic coordinate system is a celestial coordinate system in spherical coordinates, with the Sun as its center, the primary direction aligned with the approximate center of the Milky Way galaxy, and the fundamental plane parallel to an approximation of the galactic plane but offset to its north.  It uses the right-handed convention, meaning that coordinates are positive toward the north and toward the east in the fundamental plane.  Galactic longitudeLongitude (symbol  ) measures the angular distance of an object eastward along the galactic equator from the galactic center.  Analogous to terrestrial longitude, galactic longitude is usually measured in degrees (°). 

Phenytoin<====>48392<====>Phenytoin  Phenytoin (PHT), sold under the brand name Dilantin among others,  is an anti-seizure medication.   It is useful for the prevention of tonic-clonic seizures and partial seizures, but not absence seizures.   The intravenous form is used for status epilepticus that does not improve with benzodiazepines.    It may also be used for certain heart arrhythmias or neuropathic pain.   It can be taken intravenously or by mouth.   The intravenous form generally begins working within 30 minutes and is effective for 24 hours.   Blood levels can be measured to determine the proper dose. 

Navier–Stokes equations<====>48395<====>Navier–Stokes equations  In physics, the Navier–Stokes equations  , named after Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes, describe the motion of viscous fluid substances.  These balance equations arise from applying Newton's second law to fluid motion, together with the assumption that the stress in the fluid is the sum of a diffusing viscous term (proportional to the gradient of velocity) and a pressure term—hence describing viscous flow.  The main difference between them and the simpler Euler equations for inviscid flow is that Navier–Stokes equations also factor in the Froude limit (no external field) and are not conservation equations, but rather a dissipative system, in the sense that they cannot be put into the quasilinear homogeneous form:  \mathbf y_t + \mathbf A(\mathbf y) \mathbf y_x = 0. 

Mathematical analysis<====>48396<====>Mathematical analysisMathematical analysis is the branch of mathematics dealing with limitsand related theories, such as differentiation, integration, measure, infinite series, and analytic functions.   These theories are usually studied in the context of real and complex numbers and functions.  Analysis evolved from calculus, which involves the elementary concepts and techniques of analysis. Analysis may be distinguished from geometry; however, it can be applied to any space of mathematical objects that has a definition of nearness (a topological space) or specific distances between objects  (a metric space). HistoryMathematical analysis formally developed in the 17th century during the Scientific Revolution,    but many of its ideas can be traced back to earlier mathematicians. 

Isocyanate<====>48397<====>Isocyanate Isocyanate is the functional group with the formula R–N=C=O.   Organic compounds that contain an isocyanate group are referred to as isocyanates.   An isocyanate that has two isocyanate groups is known as a di-isocyanate.  Di-isocyanates are manufactured for reactions with polyols in the production of polyurethanes, a class of polymers. Isocyanates should not be confused with cyanate esters and isocyanides, whose behaviors are very different.   The cyanate (cyanate ester) functional group (R–O–C≡N) is arranged differently from the isocyanate group (R–N=C=O).   Isocyanides have the connectivity R-N≡C, lacking the oxygen of the cyanate groups. 

Philosophical analysis<====>48398<====>Philosophical analysisPhilosophical analysis (from  ) is a general term for techniques typically used by philosophers in the analytic tradition that involve "breaking down" (i. e.  analyzing) philosophical issues.  Arguably the most prominent of these techniques is the analysis of concepts (known as conceptual analysis).  This article will examine the major philosophical techniques associated with the notion of analysis, as well as examine the controversies surrounding it. Method of analysisWhile analysis is characteristic of the analytic tradition in philosophy, what is to be analyzed (the analysandum) often varies.  Some philosophers focus on analyzing linguistic phenomena, such as sentences, while others focus on psychological phenomena, such as sense data. 

Internet backbone<====>48402<====>Internet backboneThe Internet backbone might be defined by the principal data routes between large, strategically interconnected computer networks and core routers on the Internet.  These data routes are hosted by commercial, government, academic and other high-capacity network centers, the Internet exchange points and network access points, that exchange Internet traffic between the countries, continents and across the oceans.  Internet service providers, often Tier 1 networks, participate in Internet backbone  traffic by privately negotiated interconnection agreements, primarily governed by the principle of settlement-free peering. History The first packet-switched computer network was the NPL network, followed closely by the ARPANET. 

Ring (mathematics)<====>48404<====>Ring (mathematics) In mathematics, a ring is one of the fundamental algebraic structures used in abstract algebra.  It consists of a set equipped with two binary operations that generalize the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication.   Through this generalization, theorems from arithmetic are extended to non-numerical objects such as polynomials, series, matrices and functions. The conceptualization of rings began in the 1870s and was completed in the 1920s.  Key contributors include Dedekind, Hilbert, Fraenkel, and Noether.  Rings were first formalized as a generalization of Dedekind domains that occur in number theory, and of polynomial rings and rings of invariants that occur in algebraic geometry and invariant theory. 

Caesar cipher<====>48405<====>Caesar cipher  In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.  It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.  For example, with a left shift of 3,  D  would be replaced by  A ,  E  would become  B , and so on.  The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

Gottlob Frege<====>48416<====>Gottlob Frege  Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege ( ;   ; 8 November 1848 – 26 July 1925) was a German philosopher, logician, and mathematician.   He is understood by many to be the father of analytic philosophy, concentrating on the philosophy of language and mathematics.  Though largely ignored during his lifetime, Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932) and Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) introduced his work to later generations of logicians and philosophers. His contributions include the development of modern logic in the Begriffsschrift and work in the foundations of mathematics.   His book the Foundations of Arithmetic is the seminal text of the logicist project, and is cited by Michael Dummett as where to pinpoint the linguistic turn.

He has also written plays and screenplays, and directed several short films. BiographyIrvine Welsh was born in Leith, the port area of the Scottish capital Edinburgh.   He states that he was born in 1958, though, according to the Glasgow police, his birth record is dated around 1951. 

List of chess variants<====>48556<====>List of chess variants A chess variant (or unorthodox chess) is a game "related to, derived from, or inspired by chess".   The difference from chess might include one or more of the following:different rules for capture, move order, game objective, etc. ;addition, substitution, or removal of pieces in standard chess (non-standard pieces are known as fairy pieces);different chessboard (larger or smaller, non-square board shape, or different intra-board cell shapes such as hexagons). Just as in traditional chess, chess variants can be played over-the-board (OTB), or by correspondence. Regional chess games, some of which are older than Western chess, such as chaturanga, shatranj, shogi, and xiangqi, are typically called chess variants in the Western world even though they are not derived from, or inspired by, western chess. 

Archbishop<====>48557<====>Archbishop In Christianity, an archbishop ( , via Latin archiepiscopus, from Greek  , from  -, "chief", and  , "bishop")    is a bishop of higher rank or office.  In some cases, like the Lutheran Church of Sweden, it is the denomination leader title.  Like popes, patriarchs, metropolitans, cardinal bishops, diocesan bishops, and suffragan bishops, archbishops are in the highest of the three traditional orders of bishops, priests (also called presbyters), and deacons.  An archbishop may be granted the title, or ordained as chief pastor of a metropolitan see or  another episcopal see to which the title of archbishop is attached. 

Synagogue<====>48559<====>Synagogue  A synagogue, also spelled synagog (pronounced  ; from Greek  ,  , 'assembly',    , 'house of assembly' or    , house oa or    ), is a Jewish house of prayer. Synagogues have a large place for prayer (the main sanctuary), and may also have smaller rooms for study and sometimes a social hall and offices.  Some have a separate room for Torah study, called the beith midrash (Sephardi) beis medrash (Ashkenazi)—  ('house of study'). Synagogues are consecrated spaces used for the purpose of prayer, Tanakh (the entire Hebrew Scriptures including Torah) reading, study and assembly; however, a synagogue is not necessary for worship. 

Tree (graph theory)<====>48560<====>Tree (graph theory) In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path.  In other words, any acyclic connected graph is a tree.  A forest is a disjoint union of trees. The various kinds of data structures referred to as trees in computer science have underlying graphs that are trees in graph theory, although such data structures are generally rooted trees.  A rooted tree may be directed, called a directed rooted tree,  either making all its edges point away from the root—in which case it is called an arborescence,    branching,    or out-tree —or making all its edges point towards the root—in which case it is called an anti-arborescence    or in-tree. 

Air traffic control<====>48563<====>Air traffic control  Air traffic control (ATC) is a service provided by ground-based air traffic controllers who direct aircraft on the ground and through controlled airspace, and can provide advisory services to aircraft in non-controlled airspace.   The primary purpose of ATC worldwide is to prevent collisions, organize and expedite the flow of air traffic, and provide information and other support for pilots.   In some countries, ATC plays a security or defensive role, or is operated by the military. To prevent collisions, ATC enforces traffic separation rules, which ensure each aircraft maintains a minimum amount of empty space around it at all times. 

Ecovillage<====>48566<====>EcovillageEcovillages  are traditional or intentional communities whose goal is to become more socially, culturally, economically and ecologically sustainable.  Ecovillages are consciously designed through locally owned, participatory processes to regenerate and restore their social and natural environments.  Most range from a population of 50 to 150 individuals, although some are smaller, and traditional ecovillages are often much larger.  Larger ecovillages often exist as networks of smaller subcommunities.  Certain ecovillages have grown by the addition of individuals, families, or other small groups who are not necessarily members settling on the periphery of the ecovillage and effectively participating in the ecovillage community. 

Shimon Peres<====>48569<====>Shimon Peres   Shimon Peres ( ;   ,  ; born Szymon Perski; August 2, 1923 – September 28, 2016) was an Israeli politician who served both as  ninth President of Israel (2007   2014), and twice Prime Minister of Israel, as well as Interim Prime Minister, in the 1970s to the 1990s.  He was a member of twelve cabinets and represented five political parties in a political career spanning  70 years.   Peres was elected to the Knesset in November 1959 and, except for a three-month-long hiatus in early 2006, was in office continuously until he was elected President in 2007. 

Ecgberht, King of Wessex<====>48570<====>Ecgberht, King of Wessex    Ecgberht (771/775 – 839), also spelled Egbert, Ecgbert, or Ecgbriht, was King of Wessex from 802 until his death in 839.  His father was Ealhmund of Kent.  In the 780s Ecgberht was forced into exile by Offa of Mercia and Beorhtric of Wessex, but on Beorhtric's death in 802 Ecgberht returned and took the throne. Little is known of the first 20 years of Ecgberht's reign, but it is thought that he was able to maintain the independence of Wessex against the kingdom of Mercia, which at that time dominated the other southern English kingdoms. 

Æthelwulf<====>48571<====>Æthelwulf   Æthelwulf (Old English for "Noble Wolf";  died 13 January 858) was King of Wessex from 839 to 858.   In 825, his father, King Egbert, defeated King Beornwulf of Mercia, ending a long Mercian dominance over Anglo-Saxon England south of the Humber.  Egbert sent Æthelwulf with an army to Kent, where he expelled the Mercian sub-king and was himself appointed sub-king.  After 830, Egbert maintained good relations with Mercia, and this was continued by Æthelwulf when he became king in 839, the first son to succeed his father as West Saxon king since 641. 

Cîteaux Abbey<====>48572<====>Cîteaux Abbey Cîteaux Abbey (French: Abbaye de Cîteaux) is a Roman Catholic abbey located in Saint-Nicolas-lès-Cîteaux, south of Dijon, France.   Today it belongs to the Trappists, or Cistercians of the Strict Observance (OCSO).  Cîteaux, formerly spelled Cisteaux, is the mother house of the Cistercian order. The abbey has about 35 members.   The monks produce a cheese branded under the abbey's name, as well as caramels and honey-based candies. History Cîteaux Abbey was founded on Saint Benedict's Day, 21 March 1098,  by a group of monks from Molesme Abbey seeking to follow more closely the Rule of St. 

The Andromeda Strain<====>48573<====>The Andromeda Strain  The Andromeda Strain is a 1969 techno-thriller novel by Michael Crichton documenting the efforts of a team of scientists investigating the outbreak of a deadly extraterrestrial microorganism in New Mexico.  The Andromeda Strain appeared in the New York Times Best Seller list, establishing Michael Crichton as a genre writer. Plot summaryA military satellite returns to Earth.   Aerial surveillance reveals that everyone in Piedmont, Arizona, the town closest to where the satellite landed, is apparently dead.  The duty officer of the base tasked with retrieving the satellite suspects that it returned with extraterrestrial contamination and recommends activating Wildfire, a protocol for a government-sponsored team intended to contain threats of this nature.

Pulitzer Prize for Fiction<====>48586<====>Pulitzer Prize for Fiction The Pulitzer Prize for Fiction is one of the seven American Pulitzer Prizes that are annually awarded for Letters, Drama, and Music.  It recognizes distinguished fiction by an American author, preferably dealing with American life, published during the preceding calendar year.  As the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel, it was one of the original Pulitzers; the program was inaugurated in 1917 with seven prizes, four of which were awarded that year.   (No Novel prize was awarded in 1917; the first was awarded in 1918. ) Finalists have been announced since 1980, ordinarily a total of three. 

Æthelberht, King of Wessex<====>48587<====>Æthelberht, King of Wessex Æthelberht (or Ethelbert;  , meaning "magnificent noble") was the King of Kent from 858 and of Wessex from 860 until his death in 865.  He was the third son of Æthelwulf of Wessex and his first wife, Osburh.  In 855 he became under-king of Kent while his father, Æthelwulf, visited Rome.  His brother Æthelbald was left in charge of the West Saxons.  After his father's death in 858 he succeeded him as king of Kent and the other eastern parts of the kingdom.  When Æthelbald died childless in 860, the kingship of the West Saxons also passed to Æthelberht. 

Martyr<====>48588<====>Martyr A martyr (Greek: μάρτυς, mártys, "witness"; stem μάρτυρ-, mártyr-) is someone who suffers persecution and death for advocating, renouncing, refusing to renounce, or refusing to advocate a belief or cause as demanded by an external party.  This refusal to comply with the presented demands results in the punishment or execution of the martyr by the oppressor.  Originally applied only to those who suffered for their religious beliefs, the term has come to be used in connection with people imprisoned  or killed for espousing a political cause. Most martyrs are considered holy or are respected by their followers, becoming symbols of exceptional leadership and heroism in the face of difficult circumstances. 

Barbara Pym<====>48591<====>Barbara Pym  Barbara Mary Crampton Pym (2 June 1913 – 11 January 1980) was an English novelist.  In the 1950s she published a series of social comedies, of which the best known are Excellent Women (1952) and A Glass of Blessings (1958).  In 1977 her career was revived when the critic Lord David Cecil and the poet Philip Larkin both nominated her as the most under-rated writer of the century.  Her novel Quartet in Autumn (1977) was nominated for the Booker Prize that year, and she was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. 

Samuel Johnson<====>48594<====>Samuel Johnson   Samuel Johnson (18 September 1709   – 13 December 1784), often referred to as Dr.  Johnson, was an English writer who made lasting contributions to English literature as a poet, essayist, moralist, literary critic, biographer, editor and lexicographer.  He was a devout Anglican and committed Tory, and is described by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as "arguably the most distinguished man of letters in English history".   He is also the subject of James Boswell's The Life of Samuel Johnson, described by Walter Jackson Bate as "the most famous single work of biographical art in the whole of literature". 

Douglas MacArthur<====>48596<====>Douglas MacArthur Douglas MacArthur (26 January 1880 5 April 1964) was an American five-star general and Field Marshal of the Philippine Army.  He was Chief of Staff of the United States Army during the 1930s and played a prominent role in the Pacific theater during World War II.  He received the Medal of Honor for his service in the Philippines Campaign, which made him and his father Arthur MacArthur Jr. , the first father and son to be awarded the medal.  He was one of only five men ever to rise to the rank of General of the Army in the US Army, and the only man ever to become a field marshal in the Philippine Army. 

Furniture<====>48597<====>Furniture   Furniture refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities such as seating (e. g. , chairs, stools, and sofas), eating (tables), and sleeping (e. g. , beds).  Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and desks), or to store things (e. g. , cupboards and shelves).  Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of decorative art.  In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose.  It can be made from many materials, including metal, plastic, and wood. 

Sendmail<====>48600<====>Sendmail  Sendmail is a general purpose internetwork email routing facility that supports many kinds of mail-transfer and delivery methods, including the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) used for email transport over the Internet. A descendant of the delivermail program written by Eric Allman, Sendmail is a well-known project of the free and open source software and Unix communities.  It has spread both as free software and proprietary software. OverviewAllman had written the original ARPANET delivermail which shipped in 1979 with 4. 0 and 4. 1 BSD.  He wrote Sendmail as a derivative of delivermail in the early 1980s at UC Berkeley.

See Special Pulitzers for Letters. 

Grassroots democracy<====>48621<====>Grassroots democracy   Grassroots democracy is a tendency towards designing political processes where as much decision-making authority as practical is shifted to the organization's lowest geographic or social level of organization.   Grassroots organisations can have a variety of structures; depending on the type of organization and what the members want.  These can be non-structured and non-hierarchical organizations that are run by all members, or by whichever member wishes to do something.  To cite a specific hypothetical example, a national grassroots organization would place as much decision-making power as possible in the hands of local chapters or common members instead of the head office. 

War crime<====>48626<====>War crime   A war crime is an act that constitutes a serious violation of the law of war that gives rise to individual criminal responsibility.Examples of war crimes include intentionally killing civilians or prisoners, torture, destroying civilian property, taking hostages, perfidy, rape, using child soldiers, pillaging, declaring that no quarter will be given, and serious violations of the principles of distinction and proportionality, such as strategic bombing of civilian populations.  The concept of war crimes emerged at the turn of the twentieth century when the body of customary international law applicable to warfare between sovereign states was codified. 

Gaussian integer<====>48628<====>Gaussian integerIn number theory, a Gaussian integer is a complex number whose real and imaginary parts are both integers.  The Gaussian integers, with ordinary addition and multiplication of complex numbers, form an integral domain, usually written as  .This integral domain is a particular case of a commutative ring of quadratic integers.  It does not have a total ordering that respects arithmetic. Basic definitionsThe Gaussian integers are the set \mathbf{Z}[i]=\{a+bi \mid a,b\in \mathbf{Z} \}, \qquad \text{ where } i^2 = -1.   In other words, a Gaussian integer is a complex number such that its real and imaginary parts are both integers. 

Normal space<====>48629<====>Normal space  In topology and related branches of mathematics, a normal space is a topological space X that satisfies Axiom T 4 : every two disjoint closed sets of X have disjoint open neighborhoods.  A normal Hausdorff space is also called a T 4  space.  These conditions are examples of separation axioms and their further strengthenings define completely normal Hausdorff spaces, or T 5  spaces, and perfectly normal Hausdorff spaces, or T 6  spaces. DefinitionsA topological space X is a normal space if, given any disjoint closed sets E and F, there are neighbourhoods U of E and V of F that are also disjoint.

January 5 - A launch of the communication satellite GSAT-14 aboard the GSLV MK. II D5 marks the first successful flight of an Indian cryogenic engine. January 19 -  A bomb attack on an army convoy in the city of Bannu kills at least 26 Pakistani soldiers and injures 38 others. 

Paracompact space<====>48631<====>Paracompact spaceIn mathematics, a paracompact space is a topological space in which every open cover has an open refinement that is locally finite.  These spaces were introduced by  .  Every compact space is paracompact.  Every paracompact Hausdorff space is normal, and a Hausdorff space is paracompact if and only if it admits partitions of unity subordinate to any open cover.   Sometimes paracompact spaces are defined so as to always be Hausdorff. Every closed subspace of a paracompact space is paracompact.  While compact subsets of Hausdorff spaces are always closed, this is not true for paracompact subsets. 

Locally compact space<====>48632<====>Locally compact spaceIn topology and related branches of mathematics, a topological space is called locally compact if, roughly speaking, each small portion of the space looks like a small portion of a compact space. Formal definitionLet X be a topological space.  Most commonly X is called locally compact, if every point of X has a compact neighbourhood. There are other common definitions: They are all equivalent if X is a Hausdorff space (or preregular).  But they are not equivalent in general:1.  every point of X has a compact neighbourhood. 2.  every point of X has a closed compact neighbourhood. 

Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography<====>48633<====>Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography The Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography is one of the American Pulitzer Prizes annually awarded for journalism.  From 2000 it has used the "breaking news" name but it is considered a continuation of the Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography, which was awarded from 1968 to 1999.  Prior to 1968, a single Prize was awarded for photojournalism, the Pulitzer Prize for Photography, which was replaced in that year by Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography and Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography. List of winners for Pulitzer Prize for Spot News PhotographyThere were 33 Spot News Photography prizes awarded in 32 years including two in 1977 (for 1976 work). 

Nowhere dense set<====>48634<====>Nowhere dense setIn mathematics, a nowhere dense set on a topological space is a set whose closure has empty interior.  In a very loose sense, it is a set whose elements are not tightly clustered (as defined by the topology on the space) anywhere.  The order of operations is important.  For example, the set of rational numbers, as a subset of R, has the property that the interior has an empty closure, but it is not nowhere dense; in fact it is dense in R.  Equivalently, a nowhere dense set is a set that is not dense in any nonempty open set. 

Partition of unity<====>48636<====>Partition of unityIn mathematics, a partition of unity of a topological space X is a set R of continuous functions from X to the unit interval [0,1] such that for every point,  x\in X ,there is a neighbourhood of x where all but a finite number of the functions of R are 0, andthe sum of all the function values at x is 1, i. e. ,  \;\sum_{\rho\in R} \rho(x) = 1 . Partitions of unity are useful because they often allow one to extend local constructions to the whole space.   They are also important in the interpolation of data, in signal processing, and the theory of spline functions. 

Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting<====>48637<====>Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting   The Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting is a Pulitzer Prize awarded for a distinguished example of breaking news, local reporting on news of the moment.  It has been awarded since 1953 under several names: From 1953 to 1963: Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting, Edition TimeFrom 1964 to 1984: Pulitzer Prize for Local General or Spot News ReportingFrom 1985 to 1990: Pulitzer Prize for General News ReportingFrom 1991 to 1997: Pulitzer Prize for Spot News ReportingFrom 1998 to present: Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News ReportingPrior to 1953, a Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting combined both breaking and investigative reporting under one category. 

Universal jurisdiction<====>48640<====>Universal jurisdiction Universal jurisdiction allows states or international organizations to claim criminal jurisdiction over an accused person regardless of where the alleged crime was committed, and regardless of the accused's nationality, country of residence, or any other relation with the prosecuting entity.  Crimes prosecuted under universal jurisdiction are considered crimes against all, too serious to tolerate jurisdictional arbitrage.   The concept of universal jurisdiction is therefore closely linked to the idea that some international norms are erga omnes, or owed to the entire world community, as well as the concept of jus cogens – that certain international law obligations are binding on all states. 

1896 Summer Olympics<====>48644<====>1896 Summer Olympics    The 1896 Summer Olympics ( ,  ), officially known as the Games of the I Olympiad, was the first international Olympic Games held in modern history.  Organised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which had been created by Pierre de Coubertin, it was held in Athens, Greece, from 6 to 15 April 1896. Winners were given a silver medal, while runners-up received a copper medal.  Retroactively, the IOC has converted these to gold and silver, and awarded bronze medals to third placed athletes.  Ten of the 14 participating nations earned medals. 

Thai language<====>48647<====>Thai language  Thai , Central Thai , or Siamese , is the national and official language of Thailand and the first language of the Thai people and the vast majority of Thai Chinese.  It is a member of the Tai group of the Tai–Kadai language family.  Over half of its words are borrowed from Pali, Sanskrit, Mon, and Old Khmer.  It is a tonal and analytic language. Thai also has a complex orthography and system of relational markers.   Spoken Thai is mutually intelligible with Laotian, the language of Laos; the two languages are written with slightly different scripts but are linguistically similar.

It was published in the United States as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by Scholastic Corporation in 1998.  The plot follows Harry Potter, a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage as he makes close friends and a few enemies in his first year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 

Fritigern<====>48651<====>FritigernFritigern or Fritigernus  (died ca.  380) was a Thervingian Gothic chieftain whose decisive victory at Adrianople during the Gothic War (376–382) led to favourable terms for the Goths when peace was made with Gratian and Theodosius I in 382. Conflicts against AthanaricSocrates Scholasticus, Sozomen, and Zosimus refer to conflicts between Fritigern and Athanaric.Ammianus Marcellinus and Philostorgius do not record such conflicts. According to Socrates, Fritigern and Athanaric were rival leaders of the (Therving) Goths.  As this rivalry grew into warfare, Athanaric gained the advantage, and Fritigern asked for Roman aid.  The Emperor Valens and the Thracian field army intervened, Valens and Fritigern defeated Athanaric, and Fritigern converted to Christianity, following the same teachings as Valens followed.

"Early lifeVictor Lustig was born in Hostinné, Austria-Hungary, then known as Arnau, but soon headed West.  He was a glib and charming con man, fluent in multiple languages.He established himself by working scams on the ocean liners streaming between the Atlantic ports of France and New York City.  One of Lustig's trademark cons involved a "money-printing machine". 

Albert Abrams<====>48657<====>Albert Abrams  Albert Abrams (December 8, 1863 – January 13, 1924) was a Jewish American physician, well known during his life for inventing machines which he claimed could diagnose and cure almost any disease.   These claims were challenged from the outset.  Towards the end of his life, and again shortly after his death, many of his machines and conclusions were demonstrated to be intentionally deceptive or false.  BiographyAlbert Abrams was born in San Francisco December 8, 1863, although different other dates have also been reported.   On October 8, 1878 he inscribed at Medical College of the Pacific, worked as an assistant of Prof. 

Fuzzy control system<====>48660<====>Fuzzy control system    A fuzzy control system is a control system based on fuzzy logic—a mathematical system that analyzes analog input values in terms of  logical variables that take on continuous values between 0 and 1, in contrast to classical or digital logic, which operates on discrete values of either 1 or 0 (true or false, respectively).  OverviewFuzzy logic is widely used in machine control.

Joseph Hooker's Army of the Potomac against an army less than half its size, General Robert E.  Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia.  Chancellorsville is known as Lee's "perfect battle" because his risky decision to divide his army in the presence of a much larger enemy force resulted in a significant Confederate victory. 

Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica<====>48781<====>Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica   Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (English pronunciation  , Latin for Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy),  often referred to as simply the Principia, is a work in three books by Isaac Newton, in Latin, first published 5 July 1687.    After annotating and correcting his personal copy of the first edition,  Newton published two further editions, in 1713 and 1726.   The Principia states Newton's laws of motion, forming the foundation of classical mechanics; Newton's law of universal gravitation; and a derivation of Kepler's laws of planetary motion (which Kepler first obtained empirically). 

Polyvinylpyrrolidone<====>48786<====>Polyvinylpyrrolidone Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), also commonly called polyvidone or povidone, is a water-soluble polymer made from the monomer N-vinylpyrrolidone: UsesMedicalPVP was used as a plasma volume expander for trauma victims after the 1950s. It is used as a binder in many pharmaceutical tablets;  it simply passes through the body when taken orally.  (However, autopsies have found that crospovidone (PVPP) contributes to pulmonary vascular injury in substance abusers who have injected pharmaceutical tablets intended for oral consumption.   The long-term effects of crospovidone or povidone within the lung are unknown. )PVP added to iodine forms a complex called povidone-iodine that possesses disinfectant properties. 

Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver<====>48787<====>Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver Amanda, previously known as Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver is an open source computer archiving tool that is able to back up data residing on multiple computers on a network.  It uses a client–server model, where the server contacts each client to perform a backup at a scheduled time. Amanda was initially developed at the University of Maryland and is released under a BSD-style license.   Amanda is available both as a free community edition and fully supported enterprise edition.  Amanda runs on almost any Unix or Unix-like systems.  Amanda supports Windows systems using Samba or a native Win32 client with support for open files. 

Pathology<====>48791<====>Pathology  Pathology (from the Greek roots of pathos ( ), meaning "experience" or "suffering" whence the English word "path" is derived by transliteration, and   ( ), "study of") is a significant component of the causal study of pathogens and a major field in modern medicine and diagnosis.  Hence, 'the study of paths', by which disease comes.  The term pathology itself may be used broadly to refer to the study of disease in general, incorporating a wide range of bioscience research fields and medical practices (including plant pathology and veterinary pathology), or more narrowly to describe work within the contemporary medical field of "general pathology," which includes a number of distinct but inter-related medical specialties that diagnose disease—mostly through analysis of tissue, cell, and body fluid samples. 

Gamma-ray burst<====>48803<====>Gamma-ray burst  In gamma-ray astronomy, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are extremely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant galaxies.  They are the brightest electromagnetic events known to occur in the universe.   Bursts can last from ten milliseconds to several hours.After an initial flash of gamma rays, a longer-lived "afterglow" is usually emitted at longer wavelengths (X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, infrared, microwave and radio).  The intense radiation of most observed GRBs is thought to be released during a supernova or hypernova as a rapidly rotating, high-mass star collapses to form a neutron star, quark star, or black hole. 

London Marathon<====>48804<====>London Marathon   The London Marathon (presently known through sponsorship as the Virgin Money London Marathon) is a long-distance running event held in London, United Kingdom, part of the World Marathon Majors.  The event was first run on 29 March 1981 and has been held in the spring of every year since.   Since 2010, the race has been sponsored by Virgin Money.  The most recent event was the 2017 London Marathon on 23 April 2017.  The date of the next London Marathon is Sunday 22 April 2018.   OverviewThe race was founded by the former Olympic champion and journalist Chris Brasher and athlete John Disley. 

Second Council of Constantinople<====>48808<====>Second Council of Constantinople   The Second Council of Constantinople is the fifth of the first seven ecumenical councils recognized by both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church.  It is also recognized by the Old Catholics and others.  Protestant opinions and recognition of it are varied.  Some Protestants, such as Calvinists and Lutherans, recognise the first four councils,  whereas most High Church Anglicans accept all seven.  Constantinople II was convoked by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I under the presidency of Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople.  It was held from 5 May to 2 June 553. 

Aerobot<====>48814<====>AerobotAn aerobot is an aerial robot, usually used in the context of an unmanned space probe or unmanned aerial vehicle. While work has been done since the 1960s on robot "rovers" to explore the Moon and other worlds in the Solar system, such machines have limitations.  They tend to be expensive and have limited range, and due to the communications time lags over interplanetary distances, they have to be smart enough to navigate without disabling themselves. For planets with atmospheres of any substance, however, there is an alternative: an autonomous flying robot, or "aerobot".   Anthony Colozza, Geoffrey Landis, and Valerie Lyons, Overview of Innovative Aircraft Power and Propulsion Systems and Their Applications for Planetary Exploration, NASA TM-2003-212459 (July 2003) link to NASA TMMost aerobot concepts are based on aerostats, primarily  balloons, but occasionally airships. 

Fire balloon<====>48815<====>Fire balloon  A  , or  , was a weapon launched by Japan during World War II.  A hydrogen balloon with a load varying from a   antipersonnel bomb to one   incendiary bomb and four   incendiary devices attached, it was designed as a cheap weapon intended to make use of the jet stream over the Pacific Ocean and drop bombs on American and Canadian cities, forests, and farmland.   The Japanese fire balloon was the first ever weapon possessing intercontinental range  (the second being the Convair B-36 Peacemaker and the third being the R-7 ICBM). 

Clash of Civilizations<====>48819<====>Clash of Civilizations The Clash of Civilizations is a hypothesis that people's cultural and religious identities will be the primary source of conflict in the post-Cold War world.  The American political scientist Samuel P.  Huntington argued that future wars would be fought not between countries, but between cultures, and that Islamic extremism would become the biggest threat to world peace.  It was proposed in a 1992 lecture  at the American Enterprise Institute, which was then developed in a 1993 Foreign Affairs article titled "The Clash of Civilizations?", Official copy (free preview): The Clash of Civilizations?, Foreign Affairs, Summer 1993  in response to his former student Francis Fukuyama's 1992 book, The End of History and the Last Man. 

Malabo<====>48823<====>Malabo   Malabo ( ;  ; formerly Santa Isabel) is the capital of Equatorial Guinea and the province of Bioko Norte.  It is located on the north coast of the island of Bioko, formerly known by the Bubis, its indigenous inhabitants, as Etulá, and as Fernando Pó by the Europeans.  The city has a population of approximately 187,302 inhabitants.  Spanish is the official language of the city and of the country as well.  Spanish is the most-spoken language and practically the only one used, except some French and Portuguese. Malabo is the oldest city in Equatorial Guinea. 

Gravitational lens<====>48824<====>Gravitational lens  A gravitational lens is a distribution of matter (such as a cluster of galaxies) between a distant light source and an observer, that is capable of bending the light from the source as the light travels towards the observer.  This effect is known as gravitational lensing, and the amount of bending is one of the predictions of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity.    (Classical physics also predicts the bending of light, but only half that predicted by general relativity.  )Orest Khvolson (1924) and Frantisek Link (1936) are generally credited with being the first to discuss the effect in print. 

Wittenberg<====>48827<====>Wittenberg   Wittenberg, ( ;  ) officially  Lutherstadt Wittenberg, is a town in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.  Situated on the River Elbe, it has a population of about 50,000. The importance of Wittenberg historically was due to its seat of the Elector of Saxony, a dignity held by the dukes of Saxe-Wittenberg and also to its close connection with Martin Luther and the dawn of the Protestant Reformation; several of its buildings are associated with the events of this time.  Part of the Augustinian monastery in which Luther dwelt, first as a monk and later as owner with his wife and family, is preserved and considered to be the world's premier museum dedicated to Luther. 

Georgia (U.S. state)<====>48830<====>Georgia (U. S.  state) Georgia (   ) is a state in the southeastern United States.  It began as a British colony in 1733, the last of the original Thirteen Colonies.Named after King George II of Great Britain,    the Province of Georgia covered the area from South Carolina down to Spanish Florida and New France along Louisiana (New France), also bordering to the west towards the Mississippi River.  Georgia was the fourth state to ratify the United States Constitution, on January 2, 1788. 

Battle of Fredericksburg<====>48833<====>Battle of Fredericksburg   The Battle of Fredericksburg was fought December 11–15, 1862, in and around Fredericksburg, Virginia, between General Robert E.  Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia and the Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Major General Ambrose Burnside, as part of the American Civil War.  The Union Army's futile frontal attacks on December 13 against entrenched Confederate defenders on the heights behind the city are remembered as one of the most one-sided battles of the war, with Union casualties more than three times as heavy as those suffered by the Confederates.  A visitor to the battlefield described the battle to U. 

Battle of the Wilderness<====>48835<====>Battle of the Wilderness    The Battle of the Wilderness, fought May 5–7, 1864, was the first battle of Lt.  Gen.  Ulysses S.  Grant's 1864 Virginia Overland Campaign against Gen.  Robert E.  Lee and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in the American Civil War.  Both armies suffered heavy casualties, a harbinger of a bloody war of attrition by Grant against Lee's army and, eventually, the Confederate capital, Richmond, Virginia.  The battle was tactically inconclusive, as Grant disengaged and continued his offensive. Grant attempted to move quickly through the dense underbrush of the Wilderness of Spotsylvania, but Lee launched two of his corps on parallel roads to intercept him. 

Kava<====>48836<====>Kava  Kava or kava-kava (Piper methysticum: Latin "pepper" + Latinized Greek "intoxicating") is a crop of the western Pacific.    The name kava(-kava) is from Tongan and Marquesan, meaning "bitter";  other names for kava include ʻawa (Hawaiʻi),  ʻava (Samoa),  yaqona (Fiji),  sakau (Pohnpei),  and malok or malogu (parts of Vanuatu).    The roots of the plant are used to produce a drink with sedative, anesthetic, euphoriant, and entheogenic properties.  Kava is consumed throughout the Pacific Ocean cultures of Polynesia, including Hawaii, Vanuatu, Melanesia and some parts of Micronesia for its sedating effects. 

Sidereal time<====>48837<====>Sidereal time Sidereal time   is a timekeeping system that astronomers use to locate celestial objects.  Using sidereal time it is possible to easily point a telescope to the proper coordinates in the night sky.  Briefly, sidereal time is a "time scale that is based on Earth's rate of rotation measured relative to the fixed stars"  rather than the Sun. From a given observation point, a star found at one location in the sky will be found at the same location on another night at the same sidereal time.  This is similar to how the time kept by a sundial can be used to find the location of the Sun. 

Hour angle<====>48838<====>Hour angleIn astronomy and celestial navigation, the hour angle is one of the coordinates used in the equatorial coordinate system to give the direction of a point on the celestial sphere. The hour angle of a point is the angle between two planes: one containing the Earth's axis and the zenith (the meridian plane), and the other containing the Earth's axis and the given point (the hour circle passing through the point). The angle may be expressed as negative east of the meridian plane and positive west of the meridian plane, or as positive westward from 0° to 360°.  The angle may be measured in degrees or in time, with 24 h  = 360° exactly.

Smallmouth bass<====>48842<====>Smallmouth bass The smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) is a species of freshwater fish in the sunfish family (Centrarchidae) of the order Perciformes.   It is the type species of its genus.   One of the black basses, it is a popular game fish sought by anglers throughout the temperate zones of North America, and has been spread by stocking—as well as illegal introductions—to many cool-water tributaries and lakes in Canada and more so introduced in the United States.  The maximum recorded size is approximately 27 inches and 12 pounds.   The smallmouth bass is native to the upper and middle Mississippi River basin, the Saint Lawrence River–Great Lakes system, and up into the Hudson Bay basin. 

Largemouth bass<====>48843<====>Largemouth bass  The largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) is a freshwater gamefish in the sunfish family, a species of black bass native to North America.  It is known by a variety of regional names, such as the widemouth bass, bigmouth bass, black bass, bucketmouth, largies, Potter's fish, Florida bass, Florida largemouth, green bass, green trout, gilsdorf bass, Oswego bass, southern largemouth and (paradoxically) northern largemouth.   The largemouth bass is the state fish of Georgia, Mississippi, and Indiana, the state freshwater fish of Florida and Alabama, and the state sport fish of Tennessee. DescriptionThe largemouth and smallmouth bass is an olive-green fish, in the North East, it most often has a gray color,  marked by a series of dark, sometimes black, blotches forming a jagged horizontal stripe along each flank. 

Redeye bass<====>48844<====>Redeye bass The Redeye bass (Micropterus coosae) is a species of freshwater fish in the sunfish family (Centrarchidae) native to the Coosa River system of Georgia, Alabama.  The waters it is normally found in are cool streams and rivers in the foothills of mountains. SystematicsIn 2013, M.  coosae was split into five species with M.  coosae restricted to the Coosa River system.   M.  cahabae of the Cahaba River system, M.  chattahoochae of the Chattahoochee River system, M.  tallapoosae of the Tallapoosa River system and M.  warriorensis of the Black Warrior River system were all recognized as separate species. 

Reims<====>48845<====>ReimsReims ( ; also spelled Rheims;  ), a city in the Grand Est region of France, lies   east-northeast of Paris.  The 2013 census recorded 182,592 inhabitants (Rémoises (feminine) and Rémois (masculine)) in the city of Reims proper (the commune), and 317,611 inhabitants in the metropolitan area (aire urbaine).  Its river, the Vesle, is a tributary of the Aisne. Founded by the Gauls, it became a major city during the period of the Roman Empire.   Reims played a prominent ceremonial role in French monarchical history as the traditional site of the crowning of the kings of France.

Deflation<====>48847<====>Deflation   In economics, deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services.   Deflation occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0% (a negative inflation rate).  Inflation reduces the value of currency over time, but deflation increases it.  This allows one to buy more goods and services than before with the same amount of currency.  Deflation is distinct from disinflation, a slow-down in the inflation rate, i. e.  when inflation declines to a lower rate but is still positive.  Economists generally believe that deflation is a problem in a modern economy because it increases the real value of debt, especially if the deflation is unexpected. 

Quillback<====>48851<====>Quillback The Quillback (Carpiodes cyprinus) is a type of freshwater fish of the sucker family.    It is deeper-bodied than most suckers, leading to a carplike appearance.   It can be distinguished from carp by the lack of barbels around the mouth. Physical descriptionThe Quillback is a large, ectothermic, deep-bodied fish found throughout North America.  It has a small head, humped back and deeply forked caudal fin.  The compressed body of the Quillback makes it look flattened when viewed from the side.   The Quillback has a subterminal mouth with no barbels, and no nipple-like protrusions on the bottom lip. 

Market economy<====>48852<====>Market economy  A market economy is an economic system where decisions regarding investment, production, and distribution are based on the interplay of supply and demand,  which determines the prices of goods and services.   The major defining characteristic of a market economy is that investment decisions, or the allocation of producer good, are primarily made through capital and financial markets.This is contrasted with a planned economy, where investment and production decisions are embodied in an integrated plan of production established by a state or other organizational body that controls the factors of production. 

Walleye<====>48853<====>Walleye  Walleye  (Sander vitreus, synonym Stizostedion vitreum) is a freshwater perciform fish native to most of Canada and to the Northern United States.  It is a North American close relative of the European Zander, also known as the pikeperch.  The walleye is sometimes called the yellow walleye to distinguish it from the blue walleye, which is a subspecies that was once found in the southern Ontario and Quebec regions, but are now presumed extinct.   However, recent genetic analysis of a preserved (frozen) 'blue walleye' sample suggests that the blue and yellow walleye were simply phenotypes within the same species and do not merit separate taxonomic classification. 

Linguistic typology<====>48854<====>Linguistic typology  Linguistic typology is a field of linguistics that studies and classifies languages according to their structural and functional features.  Its aim is to describe and explain the common properties and the structural diversity of the world's languages.   It includes five subdisciplines: qualitative typology, which deals with the issue of comparing languages and within-language variance; quantitative typology, which deals with the distribution of structural patterns in the world’s languages; theoretical typology, which explains these distributions; syntactic typology, which deals with word order, word form, and word choice; and lexical typology, which deals with language vocabulary. 

Percidae<====>48859<====>Percidae The Percidae are a family of perciform fish found in fresh and brackish waters of the Northern Hemisphere.  The majority are Nearctic, but there are also Palearctic species.  The family contains about 200 species in 11 genera.  The perches, and their relatives are in this family; well-known species include the walleye, sauger, ruffe, and three species of perch.   However, small fish known as darters are also a part of this family. CharacteristicsThis family is characterized by a greater or lesser degree of armour about the head, caused by the presence of teeth or spines on the cheeks and opercles (gill covers) or their edges, and by two narrow bands of numerous close-set teeth on the sides (palatines). 

Centrarchidae<====>48863<====>Centrarchidae  The sunfish are a family (Centrarchidae) of freshwater ray-finned fish belonging to the order Perciformes.  The type genus is Centrarchus (consisting solely of the flier, C.  macropterus).  The family's 37 species include many fish familiar to North Americans, including the rock bass, largemouth bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed, and crappies.  All are native only to North America. Family members are distinguished by having at least three anal spines.  The dorsal spines are five to 13 in number, but most species have 10–12.  The pseudobranch is small and concealed.  Sizes of most are in the   range. 

Gadidae<====>48865<====>Gadidae The Gadidae are a family of marine fish, included in the order Gadiformes, known as the cods, codfishes or true cods.    It contains several commercially important fishes, including the cod, haddock, whiting, and pollock. Most gadid species are found in temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere, but several range into subtropical, Subarctic and Arctic oceans, and a single (southern blue whiting) is found in the Southern Hemisphere.  They are generally medium-sized fish, and are distinguished by the presence of three dorsal fins on the back and two anal fins on the underside.  Most species have barbels on their chins, which they use while browsing on the sea floor. 

Gadiformes<====>48866<====>Gadiformes Gadiformes are an order of ray-finned fish, also called the Anacanthini, that includes the cod and its allies.  Many major food fish are in this order.  They are found in marine waters throughout the world and the vast majority of the species are found in temperate or colder regions (tropical species are typically deep-water).  A few species may enter estuaries but only one, the burbot (Lota lota), is a freshwater fish. Common characteristics include the positioning of the pelvic fins (if present), below or in front of the pectoral fins.  Gadiformes are physoclists, which means their gas bladders do not have a pneumatic duct. 

Sciaenidae<====>48867<====>Sciaenidae The Sciaenidae are a family of fish commonly called drums or croakers in reference to the repetitive throbbing or drumming sounds they make.  The family includes the weakfish, and consists of about 275 species in about 70 genera; it belongs to the order Perciformes. CharacteristicsA sciaenid has a long dorsal fin reaching nearly to the tail, and a notch between the rays and spines of the dorsal, although the two parts are actually separate.Drums are somberly coloured, usually in shades of brown, with a lateral line on each side that extends to the tip of the caudal fin. 

Sparidae<====>48868<====>Sparidae The Sparidae are a family of fish in the order Perciformes, commonly called sea breams and porgies.  The sheepshead, scup, and red seabream are species in this family.  Most sparids are deep-bodied compressed fish with a small mouth separated by a broad space from the eye, a single dorsal fin with strong spines and soft rays, a short anal fin, long pointed pectoral fins and rather large firmly attached scales.   They are found in shallow temperate and tropical waters and are bottom-dwelling carnivores.  There are hermaphrodites in the Sparidae family of fish.  Protogyny and Protandry appear sporadically through this lineage of fish    . 

Clupeiformes<====>48869<====>Clupeiformes Clupeiformes is the order of ray-finned fish that includes the herring family, Clupeidae, and the anchovy family, Engraulidae.  The group includes many of the most important forage and food fish. Clupeiformes are physostomes, which means that the gas bladder has a pneumatic duct connecting it to the gut.  They typically lack a lateral line, but still have the eyes, fins and scales that are common to most fish, though not all fish have these attributes.  They are generally silvery fish with streamlined, spindle-shaped, bodies, and they often school.  Most species eat plankton which they filter from the water with their gill rakers. 

Clupeidae<====>48870<====>Clupeidae Clupeidae is a family of ray-finned fishes, comprising, for instance, the herrings, shads, sardines, hilsa, and menhadens.  The clupeids include many of the most important food fishes in the world, and are also commonly caught for production of fish oil and fish meal.  Many members of the family have a body protected with shiny cycloid scales (very smooth and uniform scales), a single dorsal fin, with a fusiform body for quick, evasive swimming and pursuit of prey composed of small planktonic animals.  Due to their small size, and position in the lower trophic level of many marine food webs, the levels of methylmercury they bioaccumulate are very low, reducing the risk of mercury poisoning when consumed. 

Scombridae<====>48872<====>Scombridae The Scombridae family of the mackerels, tunas, and bonitos includes many of the most important and familiar food fishes.  The family consists of 51 species in 15 genera and two subfamilies.  All species are in the subfamily Scombrinae, except the butterfly kingfish, which is the sole member of subfamily Gasterochismatinae.    Scombrids have two dorsal fins and a series of finlets behind the rear dorsal fin and anal fin.  The caudal fin is strongly divided and rigid, with a slender, ridged base.   The first (spiny) dorsal fin and the pelvic fins are normally retracted into body grooves. 

Serranidae<====>48873<====>Serranidae The Serranidae are a large family of fishes belonging to the order Perciformes.  The family contains about 450 species in 65 genera, including the sea basses and the groupers (subfamily Epinephelinae).  Although many species are small, in some cases less than  , the giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) is one of the largest bony fishes in the world, growing to   in length and   in weight.    Representatives of this group live in tropical and subtropical seas worldwide. CharacteristicsMany serranid species are brightly colored, and many of the larger species are caught commercially for food. 

Hugo Chávez<====>48874<====>Hugo Chávez  Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías ( ; 28 July 1954 – 5 March 2013) was a Venezuelan politician and revolutionary who was President of Venezuela from 1999 to 2013.  Chávez was also leader of the Fifth Republic Movement political party from its foundation in 1997 until 2007, when it merged with several other parties to form the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), which he led until 2012. Born into a working-class family in Sabaneta, Barinas, Chávez became a career military officer, and after becoming dissatisfied with the Venezuelan political system based on the Puntofijo Pact,  he founded the clandestine Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 (MBR-200) in the early 1980s. 

Code talker<====>48877<====>Code talker    Code talkers are people in the 20th century who used obscure languages as a means of secret communication during wartime.  The term is now usually associated with the United States service members during the world wars who used their knowledge of Native American languages as a basis to transmit coded messages.  In particular, there were approximately 400–500 Native Americans in the United States Marine Corps whose primary job was the transmission of secret tactical messages.  Code talkers transmitted these messages over military telephone or radio communications nets using formal or informally developed codes built upon their native languages. 

Salmonidae<====>48878<====>Salmonidae Salmonidae is a family of ray-finned fish, the only living family currently placed in the order Salmoniformes.  It includes salmon, trout, chars, freshwater whitefishes, and graylings, which collectively are known as the salmonids.  The Atlantic salmon and trout of the genus Salmo give the family and order their names. Salmonids have a relatively primitive appearance among the teleost fish, with the pelvic fins being placed far back, and an adipose fin towards the rear of the back.  They are slender fish, with rounded scales and forked tails.  Their mouths contain a single row of sharp teeth. 

Esociformes<====>48881<====>Esociformes The Esociformes are a small order of ray-finned fish, with two families, the Umbridae (mudminnows) and the Esocidae (pikes).   The pikes of genus Esox give the order its name.   The 10 species are found as five in each family.   This order is closely related to the Salmoniformes, the two comprising the superorder Protacanthopterygii, and are often included in their order.   The esociform fishes first appeared in the mid-Cretaceous — early products of the Euteleost radiation of that time.   Today, they are found only in fresh water in North America and the northern Eurasian regions. 

Sculpin<====>48884<====>Sculpin A sculpin is a type of fish that belongs to the superfamily Cottoidea in the order Scorpaeniformes.  Kane, E.  A.  and T.  E.  Higham.  (2012).  Life in the flow lane: differences in pectoral fin morphology suggest transitions in station-holding demand across species of marine sculpin.  Zoology (Jena) 115(4), 223-32.   As of 2006, this superfamily contains 11 families, 149 genera, and 756 species.  Sculpins occur in many types of habitat, including ocean and freshwater zones.  They live in rivers, submarine canyons, kelp forests, and shallow littoral habitat types, such as tidepools. 

Scorpaeniformes<====>48885<====>Scorpaeniformes The Scorpaeniformes are a diverse order of ray-finned fish, including the well-known lionfish, but have also been called the Scleroparei.  It is one of the five largest orders of bony fishes by number of species with over 1,320.  They are known as "mail-cheeked" fishes due to their distinguishing characteristic, the suborbital stay: a backwards extension of the third circumorbital bone (part of the lateral head/cheek skeleton, below the eye socket) across the cheek to the preoperculum, to which it is connected in most species.    Scorpaeniform fishes are carnivorous, mostly feeding on crustaceans and on smaller fish. 

Joe DiMaggio<====>48891<====>Joe DiMaggio  Joseph Paul DiMaggio  (November 25, 1914 – March 8, 1999), nicknamed "Joltin' Joe" and "The Yankee Clipper", was an American baseball center fielder who played his entire 13-year career in Major League Baseball for the New York Yankees.  He is perhaps best known for his 56-game hitting streak (May 15 – July 16, 1941), a record that still stands.    DiMaggio was a three-time Most Valuable Player Award winner and an All-Star in each of his 13 seasons.  During his tenure with the Yankees, the club won ten American League pennants and nine World Series championships. 

Dandenong Ranges National Park<====>48892<====>Dandenong Ranges National Park    The Dandenong Ranges National Park is a national park located in the Greater Melbourne region of Victoria, Australia.  The   national park is situated from   at its westernmost points at Ferntree Gully and Boronia to   at it easternmost point at Silvan,  east of the Melbourne city centre. The park was proclaimed on   , amalgamating the Ferntree Gully National Park, Sherbrooke Forest and Doongalla Estate.  In 1997 the Olinda State Forest, Mt.  Evelyn and Montrose Reserve were formally added to the national park. 

Lyrebird<====>48896<====>Lyrebird   A lyrebird is either of two species of ground-dwelling Australian birds that compose the genus Menura, and the family Menuridae.  They are most notable for their superb ability to mimic natural and artificial sounds from their environment, and the striking beauty of the male bird's huge tail when it is fanned out in courtship display.   Lyrebirds have unique plumes of neutral-coloured tailfeathers and are among Australia's best-known native birds. Taxonomy and systematicsThe classification of lyrebirds was the subject of much debate after the first specimens reached European scientists after 1798.  The superb lyrebird was first illustrated and described scientifically as Menura superba by Major-General Thomas Davies in 1800 to the Linnean Society of London. 

SIMSCRIPT II.5<====>48898<====>SIMSCRIPT II.5SIMSCRIPT II.5 is the latest incarnation of SIMSCRIPT, one of the oldest computer simulation languages.  Although military contractor CACI released it in 1971, it still enjoys wide use in large-scale military and air-traffic control simulations.SIMSCRIPT II.5 is a powerful, free-form, English-like, general-purpose simulation programming language. It supports the application of software engineering principles, such as structured programming and modularity, which impart orderliness and manageability to simulation models.

Simulation language<====>48899<====>Simulation language A computer simulation language is used to describe the operation of a simulation on a computer. There are two major types of simulation: continuous and discrete event though more modern languages can handle more complex combinations.  Most languages also have a graphical interface and at least a simple statistic gathering capability for the analysis of the results. An important part of discrete-event languages is the ability to generate pseudo-random numbers and variants from different probability distributions. See alsoDiscrete event simulationList of computer simulation softwareReferences  

Atomic radius<====>48900<====>Atomic radiusThe atomic radius of a chemical element is a measure of the size of its atoms, usually the mean or typical distance from the center of the nucleus to the boundary of the surrounding cloud of electrons.   Since the boundary is not a well-defined physical entity, there are various non-equivalent definitions of atomic radius.  Three widely used definitions of atomic radius are:  Van der Waals radius, ionic radius, and covalent radius. Depending on the definition, the term may apply only to isolated atoms, or also to atoms in condensed matter, covalently bound in molecules, or in ionized and excited states; and its value may be obtained through experimental measurements, or computed from theoretical models. 

Kilogram per cubic metre<====>48902<====>Kilogram per cubic metreKilogram per cubic metre is an SI derived unit of density, defined by mass in kilograms divided by volume in cubic metres.  The official SI symbolic abbreviation is kg·m −3 , or equivalently either kg/m 3  or  \tfrac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^3} \! .  Conversions1 kg/m 3  is equivalent to:= 0. 001 g/cm 3  (exactly)≈ 0. 06243 lb/ft 3  (approximately)≈ 0. 1335 oz/gal (approximately)1 g/cm 3  = 1000 kg/m 3  = 1,000,000 g/m 3  (exactly)1 lb/ft 3  ≈ 16. 02 kg/m 3  (approximately)1 oz/gal ≈ 7. 489 kg/m 3  (approximately)Relation to other measuresThe kilogram was originally based on the mass of one litre of water, thus the density of water is about 1000 kg/m 3  or 1 g/cm 3 . 

Nucleosynthesis<====>48903<====>Nucleosynthesis Nucleosynthesis is the process that creates new atomic nuclei from pre-existing nucleons, primarily protons and neutrons.  The first nuclei were formed about three minutes after the Big Bang, through the process called Big Bang nucleosynthesis.  It was then that hydrogen, helium and lithium formed to become the content of the first stars, and this primeval process is responsible for the present hydrogen/helium ratio of the cosmos. With the formation of stars, heavier nuclei were created from hydrogen and helium by stellar nucleosynthesis, a process that continues today.  Some of these elements, particularly those lighter than iron, continue to be delivered to the interstellar medium when low mass stars eject their outer envelope before they collapse to form white dwarfs. 

People's Bank of China<====>48906<====>People's Bank of ChinaThe People's Bank of China (PBC or PBOC,  ) is the central bank of the People's Republic of China with the power to carry out monetary policy and regulate financial institutions in mainland China.  Since July 2017, the People's Bank of China has the largest financial asset holdings of any central bank in the world.  HistoryThe bank was established on December 1, 1948, based on the consolidation of the Huabei Bank, the Beihai Bank and the Xibei Farmer Bank.  The headquarters was first located in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, and then moved to Beijing in 1949. 

Rules of chess<====>48907<====>Rules of chess  The rules of chess (also known as the laws of chess) are rules governing the play of the game of chess.  While the exact origins of chess are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages.  The rules continued to be slightly modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form.  The rules also varied somewhat from place to place.  Today, the standard rules are set by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), the international governing body for chess.  Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes. 

Apparent retrograde motion<====>48908<====>Apparent retrograde motion Apparent retrograde motion is the apparent motion of a planet in a direction opposite to that of other bodies within its system, as observed from a particular vantage point.  Direct motion or prograde motion is motion in the same direction as other bodies. While the terms direct and prograde are equivalent in this context, the former is the traditional term in astronomy.  The earliest recorded use of prograde was in the early 18th century, although the term is now less common.  EtymologyThe term retrograde is from the Latin word retrogradus – "backward-step", the affix retro- meaning "backwards" and gradus "step". 

Zenith<====>48909<====>Zenith   The zenith is an imaginary point directly "above" a particular location, on the imaginary celestial sphere.  "Above" means in the vertical direction opposite to the apparent gravitational force at that location.  The opposite direction, i. e.  the direction in which gravity pulls, is toward the nadir.   The zenith is the "highest" point on the celestial sphere (meaning it is the farthest up from the gravitational force). OriginThe word "zenith" derives from an inaccurate reading of the Arabic expression   ( ) proposed by ancient Persian astronomers, meaning "direction of the head" or "path above the head", by Medieval Latin scribes in the Middle Ages (during the 14th century), possibly through Old Spanish. 

Horizon<====>48910<====>Horizon The horizon or skyline is the apparent line that separates earth from sky, the line that divides all visible directions into two categories: those that intersect the Earth's surface, and those that do not.  At many locations, the true horizon is obscured by trees, buildings, mountains, etc. , and the resulting intersection of earth and sky is called the visible horizon.  When looking at a sea from a shore, the part of the sea closest to the horizon is called the offing.    Pronounced, "Hor-I-zon".  The word horizon derives from the Greek "ὁρίζων κύκλος" horizōn kyklos, "separating circle",  from the verb ὁρίζω horizō, "to divide", "to separate",  and that from "ὅρος" (oros), "boundary, landmark". 

Prince regent<====>48911<====>Prince regent  A prince regent, or prince-regent, is a prince who rules a monarchy as regent instead of a monarch, e. g. , as a result of the Sovereign's incapacity (minority or illness) or absence (remoteness, such as exile or long voyage, or simply no incumbent).  While the term itself can have the generic meaning and refer to any prince who fills the role of regent, historically it has mainly been used to describe a small number of individual princes who were regents. Prince regent in the United Kingdom In the English language the title Prince Regent is most commonly associated with George IV, who held the style HRH The Prince Regent during the incapacity, by dint of mental illness, of his father, George III (see Regent for other regents). 

Caroline of Brunswick<====>48913<====>Caroline of Brunswick   Caroline of Brunswick (Caroline Amelia Elizabeth; 17 May 1768 – 7 August 1821) was Queen of the United Kingdom by marriage to King George IV from 29 January 1820 until her death in 1821.  She was the Princess of Wales from 1795 to 1820. Her father, Charles William Ferdinand, was the ruler of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel in Germany, and her mother, Augusta, was the sister of the British king George III.  In 1794, she was engaged to her first-cousin and George III's eldest son, George, despite the two of them never having met and George already being illegally married to Maria Fitzherbert. 

Model (person)<====>48916<====>Model (person)  A model is a person with a role either to promote, display or advertise commercial products (notably fashion clothing in fashion shows), or to serve as a visual aid for people who are creating works of art or to pose for photography. Modelling ("modeling" in American English) is considered to be different from other types of public performance, such as acting or dancing.  Although the difference between modelling and performing is not always clear, appearing in a film or a play is not generally considered to be "modelling". Types of modelling include: fashion, glamour, fitness, bikini, fine art, body-part, promotional and commercial print models. 

Alexandra of Denmark<====>48918<====>Alexandra of Denmark    Alexandra of Denmark (Alexandra Caroline Marie Charlotte Louise Julia; 1 December 1844 – 20 November 1925) was Queen of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions and Empress of India as the wife of King Edward VII. Her family had been relatively obscure until 1852, when her father, Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, was chosen with the consent of the great powers to succeed his distant cousin, Frederick VII, to the Danish throne.  At the age of sixteen, she was chosen as the future wife of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, the heir apparent of Queen Victoria.

Pike's Peak Gold Rush<====>48923<====>Pike's Peak Gold RushThe Pike's Peak Gold Rush (later known as the Colorado Gold Rush) was the boom in gold prospecting and mining in the Pike's Peak Country of western Kansas Territory and southwestern Nebraska Territory of the United States that began in July 1858 and lasted until roughly the creation of the Colorado Territory on February 28, 1861.  An estimated 100,000 gold seekers took part in one of the greatest gold rushes in North American history.    The participants in the gold rush were known as "Fifty-Niners" after 1859, the peak year of the rush and often used the motto Pike's Peak or Bust! But in fact the location of the Pike's Peak Gold Rush was   north of Pike's Peak. 

Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester<====>48925<====>Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester    Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester (  – 4 August 1265), also called Simon de Munford and sometimes referred to as Simon V de Montfort to distinguish him from other Simons de Montfort, was a French-English nobleman who inherited the title and estates of the earldom of Leicester in England.  He led the rebellion against King Henry III of England during the Second Barons' War of 1263–64, and subsequently became de facto ruler of England.During his rule, Montfort called two famous parliaments. 

Camille Saint-Saëns<====>48927<====>Camille Saint-Saëns Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns ( ;  9 October 1835 16 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era.

Saint-Saëns was a musical prodigy, making his concert debut at the age of ten.  After studying at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at Saint-Merri, Paris and, from 1858, La Madeleine, the official church of the French Empire. 

Dressage<====>48929<====>Dressage  Dressage (  or  ; a French term, most commonly translated to mean "training") is a  highly skilled form of riding performed in exhibition and competition, as well as an "art" sometimes pursued solely for the sake of mastery.  As an equestrian sport defined by the International Equestrian Federation, dressage is "the highest expression of horse training" where "horse and rider are expected to perform from memory a series of predetermined movements. " Competitions are held at all levels from amateur to the Olympic Games and World Equestrian Games.  Its fundamental purpose is to develop, through standardized progressive training methods, a horse's natural athletic ability and willingness to perform, thereby maximizing its potential as a riding horse. 

Eventing<====>48931<====>Eventing    Eventing (also known as three day eventing or horse trials) is an equestrian event where a single horse and rider combination compete against other combinations across the three disciplines of dressage, cross-country, and show jumping.   This event has its roots in a comprehensive cavalry test which required mastery of several types of riding.  The competition may be run as a one-day event (ODE), where all three events are completed in one day (dressage, followed by cross country and then stadium) or a three-day event (3DE), which is more commonly now run over four days, with dressage on the first two days followed by cross country the next day and then show jumping in reverse order on the final day. 

American Correctional Association<====>48933<====>American Correctional Association The American Correctional Association (ACA; called the National Prison Association before 1954) is a private, non-profit, non-governmental trade association and accrediting body for the corrections industry, the oldest and largest such association in the world.  The organization was founded in 1870 and has a significant place in the history of prison reform in the U. S. ACA accredits over 900 prisons, jails, community residential centers (halfway houses) and various other corrections facilities in the U. S.  and internationally, using their independently published standards manuals.   Approximately 80 percent of all U. S.  state departments of corrections and youth services are active participants. 

Lobbying<====>48934<====>Lobbying    Lobbying, persuasion, or interest representation is the act of attempting to influence the actions, policies, or decisions of officials in their daily life, most often legislators or members of regulatory agencies.  Lobbying is done by many types of people, associations and organized groups, including individuals in the private sector, corporations, fellow legislators or government officials, or advocacy groups (interest groups).  Lobbyists may be among a legislator's constituencies, meaning a voter or bloc of voters within their electoral district; they may engage in lobbying as a business.  Professional lobbyists are people whose business is trying to influence legislation, regulation, or other government decisions, actions, or policies on behalf of a group or individual who hires them. 

American Legislative Exchange Council<====>48935<====>American Legislative Exchange Council  The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) is a nonprofit organization of conservative state legislators and private sector representatives who draft and share model state-level legislation for distribution among state governments in the United States.    ALEC provides a forum for state legislators and private sector members to collaborate on model bills—draft legislation that members may customize and introduce for debate in their own state legislatures.    ALEC has produced model bills on a broad range of issues, such as reducing  regulation and individual and corporate taxation, combating illegal immigration, loosening environmental regulations, tightening voter identification rules, weakening labor unions, and opposing gun control.

Empress Matilda<====>48951<====>Empress Matilda    Empress Matilda (c.  7 February 1102 10 September 1167), also known as the Empress Maude,  was the claimant to the English throne during the civil war known as the Anarchy.  The daughter of King Henry I of England, she moved to Germany as a child when she married the future Holy Roman Emperor Henry V.  She travelled with her husband into Italy in 1116, was controversially crowned in St.  Peter's Basilica, and acted as the imperial regent in Italy.  Matilda and Henry had no children, and when Henry died in 1125, the crown was claimed by Lothair II, one of his political enemies. 

Battle of Spotsylvania Court House<====>48961<====>Battle of Spotsylvania Court House   The Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, sometimes more simply referred to as the Battle of Spotsylvania (or the 19th-century spelling Spottsylvania), was the second major battle in Lt.  Gen.  Ulysses S.  Grant's 1864 Overland Campaign of the American Civil War.  Following the bloody but inconclusive Battle of the Wilderness, Grant's army disengaged from Confederate General Robert E.  Lee's army and moved to the southeast, attempting to lure Lee into battle under more favorable conditions.  Elements of Lee's army beat the Union army to the critical crossroads of Spotsylvania Court House, Virginia, and began entrenching.

Battle of Cold Harbor<====>48965<====>Battle of Cold Harbor  The Battle of Cold Harbor was fought from May 31 to June 12, 1864, with the most significant fighting occurring on June 3.  It was one of the final battles of Union Lt.  Gen.  Ulysses S.  Grant's Overland Campaign during the American Civil War, and is remembered as one of American history's bloodiest, most lopsided battles.  Thousands of Union soldiers were killed or wounded in a hopeless frontal assault against the fortified positions of Confederate Gen.  Robert E.  Lee's army. On May 31, as Grant's army once again swung around the right flank of Lee's army, Union cavalry seized the crossroads of Old Cold Harbor, about 10 miles northeast of the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, holding it against Confederate attacks until the Union infantry arrived.

Characidae<====>48971<====>Characidae Characidae, the characids or characins is a family of freshwater subtropical and tropical fish, belonging to the order Characiformes.  The name "characins" is the historical one,  but scientists today tend to prefer "characids" to reflect their status as a by and large monophyletic group at family rank.  To arrive there, this family has undergone much systematic and taxonomic change.  Among those fishes that remain in the Characidae for the time being are the tetras, comprising the very similar genera Hemigrammus and Hyphessobrycon, as well as a few related forms such as the cave and neon tetras.

Cladogram<====>48975<====>Cladogram  A cladogram (from Greek clados "branch" and gramma "character") is a diagram used in cladistics to show relations among organisms.  A cladogram is not, however, an evolutionary tree because it does not show how ancestors are related to descendants, nor does it show how much they have changed; many evolutionary trees can be inferred from a single cladogram.   A cladogram uses lines that branch off in different directions ending at a clade, a groups of organisms with a last common ancestor. 

Go strategy and tactics<====>48977<====>Go strategy and tactics   The game of Go has simple rules that can be learned very quickly but, as with chess and similar board games, complex strategies may be deployed by experienced players. Go opening theory The whole board opening is called Bùjú.  An important principle to follow in early play is "corner, side, center. " In other words, the corners are the easiest places to take territory, because two sides of the board can be used as boundaries.  Once the corners are occupied, the next most valuable points are along the side, aiming to use the edge as a territorial boundary. 

Basidiomycota<====>48980<====>Basidiomycota Basidiomycota (  ) is one of two large divisions that, together with the Ascomycota, constitute the subkingdom Dikarya (often referred to as the "higher fungi") within the kingdom Fungi. More specifically the Basidiomycota include these groups: mushrooms, puffballs, stinkhorns, bracket fungi, other polypores, jelly fungi, boletes, chanterelles, earth stars, smuts, bunts, rusts, mirror yeasts, and the human pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus. Basidiomycota are filamentous fungi composed of hyphae (except for basidiomycota-yeast; refer yeast for more information) and reproduce sexually via the formation of specialized club-shaped end cells called basidia that normally bear external meiospores (usually four).  These specialized spores are called basidiospores. 

Ascomycota<====>48981<====>Ascomycota Ascomycota is a division or phylum of the kingdom Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, form the subkingdom Dikarya.  Its members are commonly known as the sac fungi or ascomycetes.  They are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species.   The defining feature of this fungal group is the "ascus" (from Greek:   (askos), meaning "sac" or "wineskin"), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed.  However, some species of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. 

History of anatomy<====>48985<====>History of anatomy  The history of anatomy  extends from the earliest examinations of sacrificial victims to the sophisticated analyses of the body performed by modern scientists.  The study of human anatomy can be traced back thousands of years, at least to the Egyptians, but the science of anatomy, as we know it today, did not develop until far later.  The development of the study of anatomy gradually built upon concepts that were understood during the time of Galen and slowly became a part of the traditional medical curriculum.   It has been characterized, over time, by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 1,717.Idaho Springs is located in Clear Creek Canyon, in the mountains upstream from Golden, some   west of Denver.  Local legend is that the name of the city derived from annual visits to the radium hot springs made by a Native American chief and his tribe who journeyed there each year from Idaho to bathe in the magic healing waters. 

Social justice<====>48990<====>Social justice   Social justice is a concept of fair and just relations between the individual and society.  This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the distribution of wealth, opportunities for personal activity and social privileges.  In Western as well as in older Asian cultures, the concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their societal roles and receive what was their due from society.    In the current global grassroots movements for social justice, the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for social mobility, the creation of safety nets and economic justice. 

Arts and Crafts movement<====>48991<====>Arts and Crafts movement The Arts and Crafts movement was an international movement in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in Europe and North America between about 1880 and 1920, emerging in Japan (the Mingei movement) in the 1920s.  It stood for traditional craftsmanship using simple forms, and often used medieval, romantic, or folk styles of decoration.  It advocated economic and social reform and was essentially anti-industrial.It had a strong influence on the arts in Europe until it was displaced by Modernism in the 1930s,  and its influence continued among craft makers, designers, and town planners long afterwards. 

Quiz bowl<====>48993<====>Quiz bowl Quiz bowl (quizbowl,  scholar bowl, scholastic bowl, academic bowl, academic team, etc. ) is a quiz-based competition that tests players on a wide variety of academic subjects.  Standardized quiz bowl formats are played by lower school, middle school, high school, and university students throughout the United States, Germany, Canada, Asia and the United KingdomThe game is typically played with a lockout buzzer system  between at least two teams, usually consisting of four or five players each.  Players are read questions and try to score points for their team by buzzing first and responding with the correct answer. 

Limerick (poetry)<====>48994<====>Limerick (poetry) A limerick is a form of verse, often humorous and sometimes obscene, in five-line, predominantly    meter with a strict rhyme scheme of AABBA, in which the first, second and fifth line rhyme, while the third and fourth lines are shorter and share a different rhyme. The following example is a limerick of unknown origin: The form appeared in England in the early years of the 18th century.  An interesting and highly esoteric verse in limerick form is found in the diary of the Rev.  John Thomlinson (1692–1761):1717.  Sept. 

Overseas Chinese<====>48997<====>Overseas Chinese    Overseas Chinese ( ) are people of Chinese birth or descent who live outside the People's Republic of China (the Mainland, Hong Kong, Macau) and the Republic of China (Taiwan).  Overseas Chinese can be of the Han Chinese ethnic majority, or from any of the other ethnic groups in China.   On a per capita basis, Singapore has the highest proportion of Overseas Chinese outside Greater China, while Australia has the highest proportion outside Asia. TerminologyThe Chinese language has various terms equivalent to the English "Overseas Chinese" which refers to Chinese citizens residing in countries other than China: Huáqiáo ( ) or Hoan-kheh in Hokkien ( ). 

591<====>48998<====>591    Year 591 (DXCI) was a common year starting on Monday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar.  The denomination 591 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placeByzantine EmpireByzantine–Sassanid War: Emperor Maurice, seeing an opportunity to end the prolonged war to the advantage of Constantinople, assists Khosrau II to regain the Persian throne.

At the same time, an expeditionary force in Armenia advances through Caucasian Iberia into Media (modern Azerbaijan). 

Chinese Americans<====>48999<====>Chinese Americans    Chinese Americans, which includes American-born Chinese, are Americans who have full or partial Chinese ancestry.  Chinese Americans constitute one group of overseas Chinese and also a subgroup of East Asian Americans, which is a further subgroup of Asian Americans.  Many Chinese Americans are immigrants along with their descendants from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan,  as well as from other regions that include large populations of the Chinese diaspora, especially Southeast Asia and some Western countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, France and Brazil. The Chinese American community is the largest overseas Chinese community outside Asia. 

African-American civil rights movement (1954–1968)<====>49001<====>African-American civil rights movement (1954–1968) The civil rights movement, also known as the American civil rights movement and other names,  is a term that encompasses the strategies, groups, and social movements which accomplished its goal of ending legalized racial segregation and discrimination laws in the United States and secured the legal recognition and federal protection of the citizenship rights enumerated in the United States Constitution and federal law.  This article covers the movement between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the South and later in Chicago. The movement was characterized by major campaigns of civil resistance. 

Atlantic slave trade<====>49005<====>Atlantic slave trade   The Atlantic slave trade or transatlantic slave trade involved the transportation by slave traders of enslaved African people, mainly from Africa to the Americas, and then their sale there.  The slave trade used mainly the triangular trade route and its Middle Passage, and existed from the 16th to the 19th centuries.  The vast majority of those who were enslaved and transported in the transatlantic slave trade were Africans from central and western Africa, who had been sold by other West Africans to Western European slave traders (with a small number being captured directly by the slave traders in coastal raids), who brought them to the Americas. 

Diosdado Cabello<====>49006<====>Diosdado Cabello   Diosdado Cabello Rondón (born April 15, 1963 Vicepresidencia de la República Bolivariana de Venezuela, Diosdado Cabello Rondón  , accessed 19 April 2010 ) is a Venezuelan politician, member of the National Assembly of Venezuela and a former Speaker of the country's legislature, and active member of the Venezuelan armed forces.  He was involved in Hugo Chávez’s return to power after the 2002 coup d'état.  He became a leading member of Chavez’s Movimiento V República (MVR), and remains a leading member of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, into which MVR was merged in 2007. 

Stream cipher<====>49007<====>Stream cipherA stream cipher is a symmetric key cipher where plaintext digits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher digit stream (keystream).  In a stream cipher, each plaintext digit is encrypted one at a time with the corresponding digit of the keystream, to give a digit of the ciphertext stream.  Since encryption of each digit is dependent on the current state of the cipher, it is also known as state cipher.  In practice, a digit is typically a bit and the combining operation an exclusive-or (XOR). The pseudorandom keystream is typically generated serially from a random seed value using digital shift registers. 

Robert Andrews Millikan<====>49008<====>Robert Andrews Millikan  Robert Andrews Millikan (March 22, 1868 – December 19, 1953) was an American experimental physicist honored with the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1923 for the measurement of the elementary electronic charge and for his work on the photoelectric effect. Millikan graduated from Oberlin College in 1891 and obtained his doctorate at Columbia University in 1895.  In 1896 he became an assistant at the University of Chicago, where he became a full professor in 1910.  In 1909 Millikan began a series of experiments to determine the electric charge carried by a single electron.  He began by measuring the course of charged water droplets in an electric field. 

Grimm's law<====>49013<====>Grimm's lawGrimm's law (also known as the First Germanic Sound Shift or Rask's rule) is a set of statements named after Jacob Grimm describing the inherited Proto-Indo-European (PIE) stop consonants as they developed in Proto-Germanic (the common ancestor of the Germanic branch of the Indo-European family) in the 1st millennium BC.  It establishes a set of regular correspondences between early Germanic stops and fricatives and the stop consonants of certain other centum Indo-European languages (Grimm used mostly Latin and Greek for illustration). HistoryGrimm's law is the first non-trivial systematic sound change discovered, and though originally conceived of as a discovery in philology, it led to the creation of historical phonology as a separate discipline of historical linguistics. 

Verner's law<====>49016<====>Verner's lawVerner's law, stated by Karl Verner in 1875, describes a historical sound change in the Proto-Germanic language whereby voiceless fricatives *f, *þ, *s, *h, *hʷ, when immediately following an unstressed syllable in the same word, underwent voicing and became the fricatives *β, *ð, *z, *ɣ, *ɣʷ respectively.  The problemWhen Grimm's law was discovered, a strange irregularity was spotted in its operation.  The Proto-Indo-European (PIE) voiceless stops *p, *t and *k should have – according to Grimm's law – changed into Proto-Germanic (PGmc) *f (bilabial fricative  ), *þ (dental fricative  ) and *h (velar fricative  ). 

Road transport<====>49020<====>Road transport  Road transport (British English) or road transportation (American English) is the transport of passengers or goods on roads.  This transport method can be via bike or automobiles or by animal such as horse or oxen.  Standard networks of roads were adopted by Romans, Persians, Aztec, and other early societies. Cargo may be transported by trucking companies, while passengers may be transported via mass transit.  Commonly defined features of modern roads include defined lanes and signage.  Within the United States, roads between regions are connected via the Interstate Highway System. History Early roadsThe first methods of road transport were horses, oxen or even humans carrying goods over dirt tracks that often followed game trail. 

Coen de Koning<====>49021<====>Coen de Koning   Coen de Koning (30 March 1879 – 29 July 1954) was the second Dutch speed skater to win a world title, which he did in 1905.  He finished second in 500 m, and won the 1500, 5000 and 10,000 m events.   De Koning won the national all-around title in 1903, 1905 and 1912,    and set national records in the 500 m and 10,000 m in 1905; these records stood until 1926 and 1929.  De Koning also set a world record in one-hour skating, at 32,370 m in 1906,    and won the Elfstedentocht in 1912 and 1917. 

International E-road network<====>49022<====>International E-road network The international E-road network is a numbering system for roads in Europe developed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).  The network is numbered from E 1 up and its roads cross national borders.  It also reaches Central Asian countries like Kyrgyzstan, since they are members of the UNECE. European main international traffic arteries are defined by ECE/TRANS/SC. 1/2016/3/Rev. 1 which consider three types of roads: motorways, express roads, and ordinary roads. In most countries, roads carry the European route designation beside national road numbers.  Other countries like Belgium, Norway and Sweden have roads with exclusive European route signage (Examples: E 18 and E 6), while at the other end of the scale, British road signs do not show the routes at all. 

Propulsion<====>49023<====>Propulsion  Propulsion means to push forward or drive an object forward .    The term is derived from two Latin words:  , meaning before or forward; and  , meaning to drive.  Beginner's Guide to Propulsion NASA  A propulsion system consists of a source of mechanical power, and a propulsor (means of converting this power into propulsive force).  A technological system uses an engine or motor as the power source, and wheels and axles, propellers, or a propulsive nozzle to generate the force.  Components such as clutches or gearboxes may be needed to connect the motor to axles, wheels, or propellers. 

Wolfram Mathematica (software)<====>49024<====>Wolfram Mathematica (software)   Wolfram Mathematica (usually termed Mathematica) is a mathematical symbolic computation program, sometimes termed a computer algebra system or program, used in many technical, scientific, engineering, mathematical, and computing fields. It was conceived by Stephen Wolfram and is developed by Wolfram Research of Champaign, Illinois.   The Wolfram Language is the programming language used in Mathematica. FeaturesFeatures of Wolfram Mathematica include: Libraries of mathematical elementary functions and special functions Support for complex number, arbitrary precision arithmetic, interval arithmetic, and symbolic computationMatrix and data manipulation tools including support for sparse arrays2D and 3D data, function and geo visualization and animation toolsSolvers for systems of equations, diophantine equations, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), partial differential equations (PDEs), differential algebraic equations (DAEs), delay differential equations (DDEs), stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and recurrence relationsFinite element analysis including 2D and 3D adaptive mesh generationNumeric and symbolic tools for discrete and continuous calculus including continuous and discrete integral transformsConstrained and unconstrained local and global optimizationMultivariate statistics libraries including fitting, hypothesis testing, and probability and expectation calculations on over 160 distributions.Support for censored data, temporal data, time series, and unit based dataCalculations and simulations on random processes and queuesSupervised and unsupervised machine learning tools for data, images and sounds including artificial neural networksTools for text mining including regular expressions and semantic analysisData mining tools such as cluster analysis, sequence alignment and pattern matchingComputational geometry in 2D, 3D and higher dimensionsLibraries for signal processing including wavelet analysis on sounds, images and dataLinear and non-linear control system librariesTools for 2D and 3D image processing  and morphological image processing including image recognitionTools for visualizing and analysing directed and undirected graphsTools for combinatoric problemsNumber theory function libraryTools for financial calculations including bonds, annuities, derivatives, options etc.Group theory and symbolic tensor functionsImport and export filters for data, images, video, sound, computer-aided design (CAD), geographic information systems (GIS),  document and biomedical formatsDatabase collection for mathematical, scientific, and socio-economic information and access to Wolfram Alpha data and computationsTechnical word processing including formula editor and automated report generatorProgramming language supporting procedural, functional, and object-oriented constructsToolkit for adding user interfaces to calculations and applicationsTools for creating and deploying cloud based computational applications and servicesTools to connect to dynamic-link library (DLL), Structured Query Language (SQL), Java, .NET, C++, Fortran, CUDA, OpenCL, and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) based systemsTools for parallel programmingUsing both "free-form linguistic input" (a natural language user interface)   and Wolfram Language in notebook when connected to the InternetThe Notebook interfaceWolfram Mathematica is split into two parts, the kernel and the front end. The kernel interprets expressions (Wolfram Language code) and returns result expressions.The front end, designed by Theodore Gray  in 1988, provides a GUI, which allows the creation and editing of Notebook documents  containing program code with prettyprinting, formatted text together with results including typeset mathematics, graphics, GUI components, tables, and sounds. All content and formatting can be generated algorithmically or edited interactively. Standard word processing capabilities are supported, including real-time multi-lingual spell-checking.Documents can be structured using a hierarchy of cells, which allow for outlining and sectioning of a document and support automatic numbering index creation. Documents can be presented in a slideshow environment for presentations. Notebooks and their contents are represented as Mathematica expressions that can be created, modified or analyzed by Mathematica programs or converted to other formats.The front end includes development tools such as a debugger, input completion, and automatic syntax highlighting.Among the alternative front ends is the Wolfram Workbench, an Eclipse based integrated development environment (IDE), introduced in 2006. It provides project-based code development tools for Mathematica, including revision management, debugging, profiling, and testing. There is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA based IDEs to work with Wolfram Language code which in addition to syntax highlighting can analyse and auto-complete local variables and defined functions. The Mathematica Kernel also includes a command line front end.  Other interfaces include JMath,  based on GNU readline and MASH  which runs self-contained Mathematica programs (with arguments) from the UNIX command line.High-performance computingIn recent years, the capabilities for high-performance computing have been extended with the introduction of packed arrays (version 4, 1999)  and sparse matrices (version 5, 2003),  and by adopting the GNU Multi-Precision Library to evaluate high-precision arithmetic.Version 5.2 (2005) added automatic multi-threading when computations are performed on multi-core computers.  This release included CPU specific optimized libraries. In addition Mathematica is supported by third party specialist acceleration hardware such as ClearSpeed. In 2002, gridMathematica was introduced to allow user level parallel programming on heterogeneous clusters and multiprocessor systems  and in 2008 parallel computing technology was included in all Mathematica licenses including support for grid technology such as Windows HPC Server 2008, Microsoft Compute Cluster Server and Sun Grid.Support for CUDA and OpenCL GPU hardware was added in 2010. Also, since version 8 it can generate C code, which is automatically compiled by a system C compiler, such as GCC or Microsoft Visual Studio.DeploymentThere are several ways to deploy applications written in Wolfram Mathematica:Mathematica Player Pro is a runtime version of Mathematica that will run any Mathematica application but does not allow editing or creation of the code.  A free-of-charge version, Wolfram CDF Player, is provided for running Mathematica programs that have been saved in the Computable Document Format (CDF).  It can also view standard Mathematica files, but not run them. It includes plugins for common web browsers on Windows and Macintosh.webMathematica allows a web browser to act as a front end to a remote Mathematica server. It is designed to allow a user-written application to be remotely accessed via a browser on any platform. It may not be used to give full access to Mathematica. Due to bandwidth limitations interactive 3D graphics is not fully supported within a web browser.Wolfram Language code can be converted to C code or to an automatically generated DLL.Wolfram Language code can be run on a Wolfram cloud service as a web-app or as an API either on Wolfram-hosted servers or in a private installation of the Wolfram Enterprise Private Cloud.Connections with other applicationsCommunication with other applications occurs through a protocol called Wolfram Symbolic Transfer Protocol (WSTP). It allows communication between the Wolfram Mathematica kernel and front-end, and also provides a general interface between the kernel and other applications.  Wolfram Research freely distributes a developer kit for linking applications written in the programming language C to the Mathematica kernel through WSTP. Using J/Link., Mathematica 4.2   by Charles Seiter, Macworld, November 1, 2002.  a Java program can ask Mathematica to perform computations; likewise, a Mathematica program can load Java classes, manipulate Java objects and perform method calls. Similar functionality is achieved with .NET /Link,  but with .NET programs instead of Java programs. Other languages that connect to Mathematica include Haskell,  AppleScript,  Racket,  Visual Basic,  Python   and Clojure. Links are available to many mathematical software packages including OpenOffice.org Calc,  Microsoft Excel,  MATLAB,    R,  SageMath (which can also pull up Mathematica),Singular,  Wolfram SystemModeler, and Origin.

Expendable launch system<====>49026<====>Expendable launch system An expendable launch vehicle (ELV)  is a launch system or launch vehicle stage that is used only once to carry a payload into space.  Some launch vehicles used in expendable launch systems are designed to be used only once, and these are sometimes called an expendable launch system since they are specifically designed to be "expended" during a single flight.   Their components are never recovered.  This contrasts with a reusable launch system or RLV, in which some or all of the components are recovered intact.  The vehicle typically consists of several rocket stages, discarded one by one as the vehicle gains altitude and speed. 

José Ramos-Horta<====>49030<====>José Ramos-HortaJosé Manuel Ramos-Horta   ( ; born 26 December 1949) is an East Timorese politician who was the President of East Timor from 20 May 2007 to 20 May 2012.  Previously he was Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2002 to 2006 and Prime Minister from 2006 to 2007.  He is a co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize. As a founder and former member of Fretilin, Ramos-Horta served as the exiled spokesman for the East Timorese resistance during the years of the Indonesian occupation of East Timor (1975–1999).  While he continued to work with Fretilin, Ramos-Horta resigned from the party in 1988, becoming an independent politician. 

River Thames<====>49031<====>River Thames  The River Thames (   ) is a river that flows through southern England, most notably through London.  At  , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn.  It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor.  The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock.  It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. 

Epigenetics<====>49033<====>Epigenetics  Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene function that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence.The Greek prefix epi- (ἐπι- "over, outside of, around") in epigenetics implies features that are "on top of" or "in addition to" the traditional genetic basis for inheritance.   Epigenetics often refers to changes in a chromosome that affect gene activity and expression, but can also be used to describe any heritable phenotypic change that does not derive from a modification of the genome, such as prions.  Such effects on cellular and physiological phenotypic traits may result from external or environmental factors, or be part of normal developmental program. 

Hereford<====>49035<====>Hereford    Hereford ( ) is a cathedral city, civil parish and county town of Herefordshire, England.  It lies on the River Wye, approximately   east of the border with Wales,   southwest of Worcester, and   northwest of Gloucester.  With a population of 58,896,  it is the largest settlement in the county. The name "Hereford" is said to come from the Anglo-Saxon "here", an army or formation of soldiers, and the "ford", a place for crossing a river.  If this is the origin it suggests that Hereford was a place where a body of armed men forded or crossed the Wye. 

Ecological selection<====>49037<====>Ecological selection Ecological selection (or environmental selection or survival selection or individual selection or asexual selection) refers to natural selection without sexual selection, i. e.  strictly ecological processes that operate on a species' inherited traits without reference to mating or secondary sex characteristics.    The variant names describe varying circumstances where sexual selection is wholly suppressed as a mating factor.  Ecologists often study ecological selection when examining the abundance of individuals per population across regions, and what governs such abundances.  Circumstances in which it occursEcological selection can be said to be taking place in any circumstance where inheritance of specific traits is determined by ecology alone without direct sexual competition, when e.

Magnus Maximus<====>49040<====>Magnus Maximus    Magnus Maximus ( ,  ) (  August 28, 388) was Western Roman Emperor from 383 to 388. In 383, as commander of Britain, he usurped the throne against emperor Gratian, and by negotiation with emperor Theodosius I, he was made emperor in Britannia and Gaul the next year while Gratian's brother Valentinian II retained Italy, Pannonia, Hispania, and Africa.  In 387, Maximus' ambitions led him to invade Italy, resulting in his defeat by Theodosius I at the Battle of the Save in 388.  In the view of some historians, his death marked the end of direct imperial presence in Northern Gaul and Britain. 

Bokononism<====>49044<====>BokononismBokononism ( )  is a fictitious religion invented by Kurt Vonnegut and practiced by many of the characters in his novel Cat's Cradle.  Many of the sacred texts of Bokononism were written in the form of calypsos. Bokononism is based on the concept of foma, which are defined as harmless untruths.  A foundation of Bokononism is that the religion, including its texts, is formed entirely of lies; however, one who believes and adheres to these lies will have peace of mind, and perhaps live a good life.  The primary tenet of Bokononism is to "Live by the foma that make you brave and kind and healthy and happy. 

Sampler (needlework)<====>49048<====>Sampler (needlework) A (needlework) sampler is a piece of embroidery or cross-stitching produced as a demonstration or a test of skill in needlework.    It often includes the alphabet, figures, motifs, decorative borders and sometimes the name of the person who embroidered it and the date.  The word sampler is derived from the Latin ‘exemplum’ - an example.  HistoryThe earliest sampler extant is a spot sampler, i. e.  one having randomly scattered motifs, of the Nazca culture in Peru formerly in the Museum of Primitive Art, New York City.  It is estimated to date from ca. 

Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo<====>49053<====>Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo SDB, GCL (born 3 February 1948) is an East Timorese Roman Catholic bishop.  Along with José Ramos-Horta, he received the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize for work "towards a just and peaceful solution to the conflict in East Timor. "Early life and religious vocationThe fifth child of Domingos Vaz Filipe and Ermelinda Baptista Filipe, Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo was born in the village of Wailakama, near Vemasse, on the north coast of East Timor.  His father, a schoolteacher, died two years later.  His childhood years were spent in Catholic schools at Baucau and Ossu, before he proceeded to the Dare minor seminary outside Dili, from which he graduated in 1968. 

Túpac Katari Guerrilla Army<====>49054<====>Túpac Katari Guerrilla Army The Túpac Katari Guerrilla Army (Ejército Guerrillero Túpac Katari) was a Maoist guerrilla movement in Bolivia.  Albeit of indigenist inspiration, the movement had a multirracial membership.  The organization descended directly from the original revolutionaries trained by Che Guevara in the 1960s.   Their objective was to fight for social equality in Bolivia and amongst its indigenous population.  They carried out their first attack on July 5, 1991, destroying an electric power pylon in El Alto, a major city which adjoins La Paz, Bolivia's administrative capital.   Most of the group's attacks have been similarly small-scale and they had confined their activities largely to Bolivia. 

Henry Barnes (traffic engineer)<====>49057<====>Henry Barnes (traffic engineer) Henry A.  Barnes (December 16, 1906 – September 1968)  was an American traffic engineer and commissioner who served in many cities, including Flint, Michigan; Denver, Colorado; Baltimore, Maryland; and New York City.  Barnes was responsible for many innovations in applied traffic engineering, including the Green Wave of coordinated traffic signals, the application of actuated traffic signals (signals set off by the presence of an automobile or a pedestrian pushing a button), and the introduction of bus lanes. Barnes DanceThe Barnes Dance or "Barnes Shuffle" is a street-crossing system that stops all traffic and allows pedestrians to cross intersections in every direction at the same time. 

Moral absolutism<====>49062<====>Moral absolutism   Moral absolutism is an ethical view that particular actions are intrinsically right or wrong.  Stealing, for instance, might be considered to be always immoral, even if done for the well-being of others (e. g. , stealing food to feed a starving family), and even if it does in the end promote such a good.  Moral absolutism stands in contrast to other categories of normative ethical theories such as consequentialism, which holds that the morality (in the wide sense) of an act depends on the consequences or the context of the act. Moral absolutism is not the same as moral universalism (also called moral objectivism). 

Airco<====>49063<====>AircoThe Aircraft Manufacturing Company Limited (Airco) was a British aircraft manufacturer operating from 1912 to 1920.  Airco produced thousands of aircraft for the British military during the First World War, most of which were designed by their chief designer, Geoffrey de Havilland.  Advertised in 1918 as the largest aircraft company in the world, Airco established the first airline in the United Kingdom, Aircraft Transport and Travel Limited, as a subsidiary.  A glut of war surplus aircraft and a lack of government interest in aviation caused the company to become unprofitable, and in 1920 it was sold to Birmingham Small Arms Company, who had its operations liquidated later that year. 

People's Party for Freedom and Democracy<====>49064<====>People's Party for Freedom and Democracy   The People's Party for Freedom and Democracy ( , VVD;  ) is a conservative-liberal    political party in the Netherlands. The VVD, whose forerunner was the Freedom Party, supports private enterprise and economic liberalism.Andeweg R. B.  and G. A.  Irwin Government & Politics in the Netherlands 2002 Palgrave p.  48    Mark Rutte has been the party's leader since 31 May 2006 and on 14 October 2010 became Prime Minister of the Netherlands, marking the first time that the VVD led a government. 

Labour Party (Netherlands)<====>49066<====>Labour Party (Netherlands) The Labour Party (   , abbreviated as PvdA  ) is a social-democratic The PvdA is widely described as a social-democratic political party:   political party in the Netherlands. The party was founded in 1946 as a merger of the Social Democratic Workers' Party, the Free-thinking Democratic League, and the Christian Democratic Union.  Prime Ministers from the Labour Party have been Willem Drees (1948–1958), Joop den Uyl (1973–1977), and Wim Kok (1994–2002). From 2012 to 2017, the PvdA formed the second largest parliamental faction and was the junior partner in the Second Rutte cabinet with the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy. 

Pope Eugene IV<====>49069<====>Pope Eugene IV   Pope Eugene IV ( ; 1383 – 23 February 1447), born Gabriele Condulmer, was Pope from 3 March 1431 to his death in 1447.  He is the last pope to take the name "Eugene" upon his election. BiographyEarly lifeCondulmer was born in Venice to a rich merchant family.   He entered a community of Canons Regular of San Giorgio in Alga in his native city.  At the age of twenty-four he was appointed by his maternal uncle, Pope Gregory XII, as Bishop of Siena.  In Siena, the political leaders objected to a bishop who was not only 24, but also a foreigner. 

Avalanche chess<====>49070<====>Avalanche chessAvalanche chess is a chess variant designed by Ralph Betza in 1977.  After moving one of your own pieces, you must move one of your opponent's pawns forward one space. RulesRules are as normal chess except for the following.  After you move one of your own pieces, you must move one of your opponent's pawns one space forward toward you.  If none of the opponent's pawns can be moved, then that part of the turn is skipped.   You cannot use your opponent's pawn to capture.  You cannot move your opponent's pawn two spaces forward. 

Oceanus<====>49071<====>Oceanus  Oceanus ( ;   Ōkeanós,   ), also known as Ogenus (Ogenos, Ωγηνος) or Ogen (Ωγην),  was a divine figure in classical antiquity, believed by the ancient Greeks and Romans to be the divine personification of the sea, an enormous river encircling the world. EtymologyR.  S.  P.  Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek proto-form *-kay-an-.   In contrast, Michael Janda has reminded the scientific community of an earlier comparison  of the Vedic dragon Vṛtra's attribute āśáyāna- "lying on [the waters]" and Greek   (Ōkeanós), which he sees as phonetical equivalents of each other, both stemming from a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root *ō-kei-ṃ[h 1 ]no- "lying on", related to Greek   (keîtai "to lie"). 

Francis Galton<====>49072<====>Francis Galton    Sir Francis Galton, FRS ( ; 16 February 1822 – 17 January 1911) was an English Victorian statistician, progressive, polymath, sociologist, psychologist,   anthropologist, eugenicist, tropical explorer, geographer, inventor, meteorologist, proto-geneticist, and psychometrician.  He was knighted in 1909. Galton produced over 340 papers and books.  He also created the statistical concept of correlation and widely promoted regression toward the mean.  He was the first to apply statistical methods to the study of human differences and inheritance of intelligence, and introduced the use of questionnaires and surveys for collecting data on human communities, which he needed for genealogical and biographical works and for his anthropometric studies. 

Pablo Casals<====>49073<====>Pablo Casals    Pau Casals i Defilló   (Catalan:  ; December 29, 1876 October 22, 1973), usually known in English as Pablo Casals,   Honors To Be Conferred On English Composers: Series of Concerts Devoted to modern Englishmen to be Given in London, The New York Times, 1911-04-09, retrieved 2009-08-01was a cellist, composer, and conductor from Catalonia, Spain.  He is generally regarded as the pre-eminent cellist of the first half of the 20th century, and one of the greatest cellists of all time.  He made many recordings throughout his career, of solo, chamber, and orchestral music, also as conductor, but he is perhaps best remembered for the recordings of the Bach Cello Suites he made from 1936 to 1939. 

Airspeed Ltd.<====>49076<====>Airspeed Ltd. Airspeed Limited was established to build aeroplanes in 1931 in York, England, by A.  H.  Tiltman and Nevil Shute Norway (the aeronautical engineer and novelist, who used his forenames as his pen-name).  The other directors were A.  E.  Hewitt, Lord Grimthorpe and Alan Cobham.  Amy Johnson was also one of the initial subscribers for shares. FoundationAirspeed Ltd.  was founded by Nevil Shute Norway (later to become a novelist as Nevil Shute) and designer Hessell Tiltman.  In his autobiography, Slide Rule: Autobiography of an Engineer, Norway gives an account of the founding of the company and of the processes that led to the development and mass production of the Oxford. 

Georg Ohm<====>49080<====>Georg Ohm  Georg Simon Ohm ( ; 16 March 1789 – 6 July 1854) was a German physicist and mathematician.  As a school teacher, Ohm began his research with the new electrochemical cell, invented by Italian scientist Alessandro Volta.  Using equipment of his own creation, Ohm found that there is a direct proportionality between the potential difference (voltage) applied across a conductor and the resultant electric current.  This relationship is known as Ohm's law. BiographyEarly lifeGeorg Simon Ohm was born into a Protestant family in Erlangen, Brandenburg-Bayreuth (then a part of the Holy Roman Empire), son to Johann Wolfgang Ohm, a locksmith and Maria Elizabeth Beck, the daughter of a tailor in Erlangen. 

Supermodel<====>49082<====>Supermodel  A supermodel (also spelled super-modeland super model)  is a highly paid fashion model who usually has a worldwide reputation and often a background in haute couture and commercial modeling.  The term supermodel became prominent in the popular culture of the 1980s.    Supermodels usually work for prominent fashion designers and clothing brands.  They may have multimillion-dollar contracts, endorsements, and campaigns.  Supermodels have branded themselves as household names and worldwide recognition is associated with their modeling careers.

Glans penis<====>49084<====>Glans penis  The glans penis  is the sensitive bulbous structure at the distal end of the human penis.  The glans is anatomically homologous to the clitoral glans of the human female. Typically, the glans is completely or partially covered by the foreskin, except in men who have been circumcised.  The foreskin can generally be retracted over and past the glans, and may automatically retract during an erection. The glans is more commonly known as the "head" or the "tip" of the penis.  The medical name comes from the Latin words glans ('acorn') and penis ('of the penis') – the Latin genitive of this word has the same form as the nominative. 

Palette knife<====>49085<====>Palette knife A palette knife is a blunt tool used for mixing or applying paint, with a flexible steel blade.  It is primarily used for mixing paint colors, paste, etc. , or for marbling, decorative endpapers, etc.   The "palette" in the name is a reference to an artist's palette which is used for mixing oil paint and acrylic paints. Art knives come primarily in two types:palette knife resembling a putty knife with a rounded tip, suited for mixing paints on the palette; painting knife with a pointed tip, lowered or "cranked" like a trowel, suited for painting on canvas. 

Libanius<====>49086<====>Libanius Libanius ( , Libanios; c.  314 – 392 or 393) was a Greek teacher of rhetoric of the Sophist school.  During the rise of Christian hegemony in the later Roman Empire, he remained unconverted and in religious matters was a pagan Hellene. LifeLibanius was born into a once-influential, deeply cultured family of Antioch that had recently come into diminished circumstances.  At fourteen years old he began his study of rhetoric, for which he withdrew from public life and devoted himself to philosophy.  Unfamiliar with Latin literature, he deplored its influence. Libanius used his arts of rhetoric to advance various private and political causes. 

College Bowl<====>49088<====>College Bowl   College Bowl (also known as General Electric (G. E. ) College Bowl) was a radio, television, and student quiz show.  College Bowl first aired on US radio stations in 1953.  It then moved to US television broadcast networks, airing 1959 to 1963 on CBS and from 1963 to 1970 on NBC.  In 1977, the game resurfaced as an activity on college campuses through an affiliation with the Association of College Unions International (ACUI) that lasted for 31 years.  In 2008, the College Bowl Company announced its suspension of the College Bowl program, citing increased costs and financial infeasibility of continuing to work with ACUI. 

Cox's theorem<====>49089<====>Cox's theoremCox's theorem, named after the physicist Richard Threlkeld Cox, is a derivation of the laws of probability theory from a certain set of postulates.  This derivation justifies the so-called "logical" interpretation of probability, as the laws of probability derived by Cox's theorem are applicable to any proposition.  Logical (a. k. a.  objective Bayesian) probability is a type of Bayesian probability.  Other forms of Bayesianism, such as the subjective interpretation, are given other justifications. Cox's assumptionsCox wanted his system to satisfy the following conditions:Divisibility and comparability – The plausibility of a proposition is a real number and is dependent on information we have related to the proposition. 

Ohm's law<====>49090<====>Ohm's law   Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points.  Introducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance,  one arrives at the usual mathematical equation that describes this relationship:    I = \frac{V}{R}, where   is the current through the conductor in units of amperes, V is the voltage measured across the conductor in units of volts,  and R is the resistance of the conductor in units of ohms.   More specifically, Ohm's law states that the R in this relation is constant, independent of the current. 

Optical character recognition<====>49091<====>Optical character recognitionOptical character recognition (also optical character reader, OCR) is the mechanical or electronic conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example from a television broadcast).   It is widely used as a form of information entry from printed paper data records, whether passport documents, invoices, bank statements, computerised receipts, business cards, mail, printouts of static-data, or any suitable documentation. 

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (video game)<====>49093<====>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (video game)   Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six is a tactical shooter video game and the first in the Rainbow Six series.  It was developed and published by Red Storm Entertainment for the PC.  It was ported to Mac OS, Nintendo 64, PlayStation, Dreamcast and Game Boy Color.  An expansion pack, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Mission Pack: Eagle Watch, was released on January 31, 1999. GameplayRainbow Six is a tactical shooter, which focuses more on stealth and tactics than on sheer firepower, exploring the lethality of a single bullet.  To add to the realism, all in-game characters, terrorists, hostages and Rainbow operatives, can be wounded or dispatched in just fractions of a second with only one or two bullets. 

Danny Kass<====>49096<====>Danny Kass  Daniel "Danny" Kass (born September 21, 1982) is an American professional snowboarder who has competed at the Olympic level. Kass was born in Pompton Plains section of Pequannock Township, New Jersey.   He grew up in New Jersey where he began snowboarding at the age of twelve.   His home slopes are what are now known as Hidden Valley and Mountain Creek ski resorts both located in the mountains of Vernon Township and Highland Lakes.  After several years of shredding around the Mid-Atlantic States, Kass entered into the Okemo Mountain School to focus more of his time on riding some of the better pipe and park in the East. 

University of Minnesota system<====>49104<====>University of Minnesota systemThe University of Minnesota system is a public university system with several coordinate campuses spread throughout the U. S.  state of Minnesota.  It has one of the largest endowments among public universities in the U. S. , and also receives annual funding from the State of Minnesota.  The university system has five primary campuses, in the Twin Cities, Duluth, Crookston, Morris, and Rochester.  It used to have a campus in Waseca, but this was closed and converted into a federal prison for women.   The university also operates several research facilities around the state, including some large tracts of land. 

Vacuum cleaner<====>49105<====>Vacuum cleaner  A vacuum cleaner, also known as a sweeper or hoover, is a device that uses an air pump (a centrifugal fan in all but some of the very oldest models), to create a partial vacuum to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors, and from other surfaces such as upholstery and draperies. The dirt is collected by either a dustbag or a cyclone for later disposal.  Vacuum cleaners, which are used in homes as well as in industry, exist in a variety of sizes and models—small battery-powered hand-held devices, wheeled canister models for home use, domestic central vacuum cleaners, huge stationary industrial appliances that can handle several hundred litres of dust before being emptied, and self-propelled vacuum trucks for recovery of large spills or removal of contaminated soil. 

Willie Dixon<====>49107<====>Willie Dixon  William James "Willie" Dixon (July 1, 1915 January 29, 1992) was an American blues musician, vocalist, songwriter, arranger and record producer.   He was proficient in playing both the upright bass and the guitar and was a capable singer, but he is perhaps best known as one of the most prolific songwriters of his time.  Next to Muddy Waters, Dixon is recognized as the most influential person in shaping the post–World War II sound of the Chicago blues.  Trager, Oliver (2004).

Gustav I of Sweden<====>49109<====>Gustav I of SwedenGustav I, born Gustav Eriksson of the Vasa noble family and later known as Gustav Vasa (12 May 1496  – 29 September 1560), was King of Sweden from 1523 until his death in 1560,  previously self-recognised Protector of the Realm (Riksföreståndare) from 1521, during the ongoing Swedish War of Liberation against King Christian II of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.  Initially of low standing, Gustav rose to lead the rebel movement following the Stockholm Bloodbath, in which his father perished.  Gustav's election as King on 6 June 1523 and his triumphant entry into Stockholm eleven days later meant the end of Medieval Sweden's elective monarchy and the Kalmar Union, and the birth of a hereditary monarchy under the House of Vasa and its successors, including the current House of Bernadotte.

Potsdam<====>49112<====>Potsdam  Potsdam ( ) is the capital and largest city of the German federal state of Brandenburg.  It directly borders the German capital, Berlin, and is part of the Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region.  It is situated on the River Havel   southwest of Berlin's city centre. Potsdam was a residence of the Prussian kings and the German Kaiser until 1918.  Its planning embodied ideas of the Age of Enlightenment: through a careful balance of architecture and landscape, Potsdam was intended as "a picturesque, pastoral dream" which would remind its residents of their relationship with nature and reason.

Phoenix (mythology)<====>49122<====>Phoenix (mythology) In Greek mythology, and in the Talmud, a phoenix (  phoînix;  ) is a long-lived bird that is cyclically regenerated or born again. Associated with the Sun, a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the ashes of its predecessor.  According to some sources, the phoenix dies in a show of flames and combustion, although there are other sources that claim that the legendary bird dies and simply decomposes before being born again.   According to some texts, the phoenix could live over 1,400 years before rebirth.   Herodotus, Lucan, Pliny the Elder, Pope Clement I, Lactantius, Ovid, and Isidore of Seville are among those who have contributed to the retelling and transmission of the phoenix motif. 

Phoenix (constellation)<====>49123<====>Phoenix (constellation)  Phoenix is a minor constellation in the southern sky.  Named after the mythical phoenix, it was first depicted on a celestial atlas by Johann Bayer in his 1603 Uranometria.  The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille  charted the brighter stars and gave their Bayer designations in 1756.  The constellation stretches from roughly −39° to −57° declination, and from 23. 5h to 2. 5h of right ascension.  The constellations Phoenix, Grus, Pavo and Tucana, are known as the Southern Birds. The brightest star, Alpha Phoenicis, is named Ankaa, an Arabic word meaning 'the Phoenix'. 

Phoenix (son of Amyntor)<====>49124<====>Phoenix (son of Amyntor) In Greek mythology, Phoenix (  Phoinix, gen. : Φοίνικος Phoinikos), son of Amyntor and Cleobule, is one of the Myrmidons led by Achilles in the Trojan War.  Phoenix's warfaring identity is a charioteer. MythologyOf Phoenix's life before the Trojan War, it is related that he seduced his father's concubine at the instigation of his mother.  Having heard about this, Amyntor punished his son by cursing him with infertility.   Phoenix then fled to Peleus, who in turn took him to Chiron; the latter restored Phoenix's sight, whereupon Peleus made Phoenix king of the Dolopes.

Marathon, Greece<====>49131<====>Marathon, Greece  Marathon (Demotic Greek: Μαραθώνας, Marathónas; Attic/Katharevousa:  , Marathṓn) is a town in Greece and the site of the battle of Marathon in 490 BCE, in which the heavily outnumbered Athenian army defeated the Persians.  Legend has it that Pheidippides, a Greek herald at the battle, was sent running from Marathon to Athens to announce the victory, which is how the marathon running race was conceived in modern times.  HistoryThe name "Marathon" ( ) comes from the herb fennel, called marathon ( ) or marathos ( ) in Ancient Greek,  .    so Marathon literally means "a place full of fennels". 

Marathon<====>49132<====>Marathon  The marathon is a long-distance running race with an official distance of 42. 195 kilometres  (26. 219 miles, or 26 miles 385 yards),    usually run as a road race.  The event was instituted in commemoration of the fabled run of the Greek soldier Pheidippides, a messenger from the Battle of Marathon to Athens, who reported the victory. The marathon was one of the original modern Olympic events in 1896, though the distance did not become standardized until 1921.  More than 800 marathons are held throughout the world each year, with the vast majority of competitors being recreational athletes as larger marathons can have tens of thousands of participants. 

Marathon Trilogy<====>49133<====>Marathon Trilogy   The Marathon Trilogy is a science fiction first-person shooter video game series from Bungie, originally released for Mac OS.  The name Marathon is derived from the giant interstellar colony ship that provides the setting for the first game; the ship is constructed out of what used to be the Martian satellite Deimos.  The three games in the series—Marathon (1994), Marathon 2: Durandal (1995), and Marathon Infinity (1996)—are widely regarded as spiritual predecessors of Bungie's Halo series. GameplayThroughout the games the player accesses computer terminals through which he communicates with artificial intelligences, receives mission data, and gets teleported to other levels via “Jump Pads”. 

Decentralization<====>49139<====>Decentralization  Decentralization is the process of distributing or dispersing functions, powers, people or things away from a central location or authority.    While centralization, especially in the governmental sphere, is widely studied and practiced, there is no common definition or understanding of decentralization.  The meaning of decentralization may vary in part because of the different ways it is applied.   Concepts of decentralization have been applied to group dynamics and management science in private businesses and organizations, political science, law and public administration, economics and technology. HistoryThe word "centralization" came into use in France in 1794 as the post-French Revolution French Directory leadership created a new government structure.

It is the greenest city of Germany, with two-thirds green space of the total municipal area.  From any part of the city, it is only a ten-minute walk to one of the public parks or woodland paths. 

Fair trade<====>49147<====>Fair trade   Fair trade is a social movement whose stated goal is to help producers in developing countries achieve better trading conditions and to promote sustainable farming.  Members of the movement advocate the payment of higher prices to exporters, as well as improved social and environmental standards.  The movement focuses in particular on commodities, or products which are typically exported from developing countries to developed countries, but also consumed in domestic markets (e. g.  Brazil, India and Bangladesh) most notably handicrafts, coffee, cocoa, wine, sugar, fresh fruit, chocolate, flowers and gold.    The movement seeks to promote greater equity in international trading partnerships through dialogue, transparency, and respect. 

Duchy of Lorraine<====>49149<====>Duchy of Lorraine   The Duchy of Lorraine ( ,  ;  ), originally Upper Lorraine, was a duchy now included in the larger present-day region of Lorraine in northeastern France.  Its capital was Nancy. It was founded in 959 following the division of Lotharingia into two separate duchies: Upper and Lower Lorraine, the westernmost parts of the Holy Roman Empire.  The Lower duchy was quickly dismantled, while Upper Lorraine came to be known as simply the Duchy of Lorraine.  The Duchy of Lorraine was coveted and briefly occupied by the Dukes of Burgundy and the Kings of France. 

Hallucination<====>49159<====>Hallucination  A hallucination is a perception in the absence of external stimulus that has qualities of real perception.  Hallucinations are vivid, substantial, and are perceived to be located in external objective space.  They are distinguishable from several related phenomena, such as dreaming, which does not involve wakefulness; pseudohallucination, which does not mimic real perception, and is accurately perceived as unreal; illusion, which involves distorted or misinterpreted real perception; and imagery, which does not mimic real perception and is under voluntary control.Hallucinations also differ from "delusional perceptions", in which a correctly sensed and interpreted stimulus (i.

Penelope<====>49169<====>Penelope In Homer's Odyssey, Penelope (   ;  , Pēnelópeia, or  , Pēnelópē) is the wife of Odysseus, who is known for her fidelity to Odysseus while he was absent, despite having many suitors.  Her name has traditionally been associated with marital fidelity,  epitomizing the traditional view of the dutiful Penelope.  EtymologyThe origin of her name is believed by Robert S.  P.  Beekes to be Pre-Greek and related to pēnelops (πηνέλοψ)  or pēnelōps (πηνέλωψ), glossed by Hesychius as "some kind of bird"  (today arbitrarily identified with the Eurasian wigeon, to which Linnaeus gave the binomial Anas penelope), where -elōps (-έλωψ) is a common Pre-Greek suffix for predatory animals;  however, the semantic relation between the proper name and the gloss is not clear. 

Interval (music)<====>49171<====>Interval (music) In music theory, an interval is the difference between two pitches.   An interval may be described as horizontal, linear, or melodic if it refers to successively sounding tones, such as two adjacent pitches in a melody, and vertical or harmonic if it pertains to simultaneously sounding tones, such as in a chord.In Western music, intervals are most commonly differences between notes of a diatonic scale.  The smallest of these intervals is a semitone.  Intervals smaller than a semitone are called microtones.  They can be formed using the notes of various kinds of non-diatonic scales. 

Interval (mathematics)<====>49172<====>Interval (mathematics) In mathematics, a (real) interval is a set of real numbers with the property that any number that lies between two numbers in the set is also included in the set.   For example, the set of all numbers   satisfying   is an interval which contains   and  , as well as all numbers between them.  Other examples of intervals are the set of all real numbers  \R , the set of all negative real numbers, and the empty set. Real intervals play an important role in the theory of integration, because they are the simplest sets whose "size" or "measure" or "length" is easy to define. 

Conjugacy class<====>49176<====>Conjugacy classIn mathematics, especially group theory, the elements of any group may be partitioned into conjugacy classes; members of the same conjugacy class share many properties, and study of conjugacy classes of non-abelian groups reveals many important features of their structure.    For an abelian group, each conjugacy class is a set containing one element (singleton set). Functions that are constant for members of the same conjugacy class are called class functions. Definition Let   be a group.  Two elements   and    of   are conjugate, if there exists an element   in   such that  . 

Fuzzy logic<====>49180<====>Fuzzy logic Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic in which the truth values of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1.  It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false.   By contrast, in Boolean logic, the truth values of variables may only be the integer values 0 or 1. The term fuzzy logic was introduced with the 1965 proposal of fuzzy set theory by Lotfi Zadeh.Fuzzy logic had however  been studied since the 1920s, as infinite-valued logic—notably by Łukasiewicz and Tarski. 

588 Achilles<====>49181<====>588 Achilles 588 Achilles ( ,  ), provisional designation  , is a large and dark asteroid, classified as Jupiter trojan, the first and 6th-largest of its kind ever confirmed by astronomers  (  was discovered 2 years previously, but was not observed long enough to calculate an orbit).  It was discovered on 22 February 1906, by the German astronomer Max Wolf at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany.  It measures about 135 kilometers in diameter and was named after Achilles from Greek mythology.  Orbit and classificationAchilles orbits the Sun at a distance of 4. 4–6. 

How the Self Controls Its Brain<====>49184<====>How the Self Controls Its Brain How the Self Controls Its Brain  is a book by Sir John Eccles, proposing a theory of philosophical dualism, and offering a justification of how there can be mind-brain action without violating the principle of the conservation of energy.  The model was developed jointly with the nuclear physicist Friedrich Beck in the period 1991-1992.Eccles called the fundamental neural units of the cerebral cortex "dendrons", which are cylindrical bundles of neurons arranged vertically in the six outer layers or laminae of the cortex, each cylinder being about 60 micrometres in diameter. 

Trofim Lysenko<====>49185<====>Trofim Lysenko  Trofim Denisovich Lysenko ( ,  ;   20 November 1976) was a ukrainian and soviet agrobiologist.  As a student Lysenko found himself interested in agriculture, where he worked on a few different projects, one involving the effects of temperature variation on the life-cycle of plants.  This later led him to consider how he might use this work to convert winter wheat into spring wheat.  He named the process "jarovization" in Russian, and later translated it as "vernalization".   Lysenko was a strong proponent of soft inheritance and rejected Mendelian genetics in favor of pseudoscientific   ideas termed Lysenkoism. 

Pope Anacletus<====>49186<====>Pope Anacletus  Pope Anacletus (died c.  92), also known as Cletus, was the third Bishop of Rome, following Saint Peter and Pope Linus.  Anacletus served as pope between c.  79 and his death, c.  92. Name and etymologyThe name "Cletus" in Ancient Greek means "one who has been called," and "Anacletus" means "one who has been called back. " Also "Anencletus" (Greek: Ανέγκλητος) means "unimpeachable. "The Roman Martyrology mentions the Pope in question only under the name of "Cletus. "   The Annuario Pontificio gives both forms as alternatives.  Eusebius, Saint Irenaeus, Saint Augustine and Optatus all suggest that both names refer to the same individual.

George Westinghouse<====>49195<====>George Westinghouse George Westinghouse Jr.  (October 6, 1846 – March 12, 1914) was an American entrepreneur and engineer based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania who invented the railway air brake and was a pioneer of the electrical industry, gaining his first patent at the age of 19.  Westinghouse saw the potential in alternating current as an electricity distribution system in the early 1880s and put all his resources into developing and marketing it, a move that put his business in direct competition with the Edison direct current system.  In 1911 Westinghouse received the AIEE's Edison Medal "For meritorious achievement in connection with the development of the alternating current system. 

Antiviral drug<====>49197<====>Antiviral drug  Antiviral drugs are a class of medication used specifically for treating viral infections rather than bacterial ones.Most antivirals are used for specific viral infections, while a broad-spectrum antiviral  is effective against a wide range of viruses.Unlike most antibiotics, antiviral drugs do not destroy their target pathogen; instead they inhibit their development. Antiviral drugs are one class of antimicrobials, a larger group which also includes antibiotic (also termed antibacterial), antifungal and antiparasitic drugs,  or antiviral drugs based on monoclonal antibodies.   Most antivirals are considered relatively harmless to the host, and therefore can be used to treat infections. 

Reductionism<====>49198<====>ReductionismReductionism is any of several related philosophical ideas regarding the associations between phenomena which can be described in terms of other simpler or more fundamental phenomena.  The Oxford Companion to Philosophy suggests that reductionism is "one of the most used and abused terms in the philosophical lexicon" and suggests a three part division:   Ontological reductionism: a belief that the whole of reality consists of a minimal number of parts. Methodological reductionism: the scientific attempt to provide explanation in terms of ever smaller entities. Theory reductionism: the suggestion that a newer theory does not replace or absorb an older one, but reduces it to more basic terms. 

Queen Elizabeth 2<====>49200<====>Queen Elizabeth 2    }   The Queen Elizabeth 2, often referred to simply as QE2, is a retired ocean liner built for the Cunard Line which was operated by Cunard as both a transatlantic liner and a cruise ship from 1969 to 2008.  She was designed for the transatlantic service from her home port of Southampton, UK, to New York, and was named after the earlier Cunard liner  .  She served as the flagship of the line from 1969 until succeeded by   in 2004.  Designed in Cunard's then headquarters and regional offices in Liverpool and Southampton respectively, and built in Clydebank, Scotland, QE2 was considered the last of the great transatlantic ocean liners until Queen Mary 2 entered service. 

Biplane<====>49201<====>Biplane A biplane is a fixed-wing aircraft with two main wings stacked one above the other.  The first powered, controlled aeroplane to fly, the Wright Flyer, used a biplane wing arrangement, as did many aircraft in the early years of aviation.  While a biplane wing structure has a structural advantage over a monoplane, it produces more drag than a similar unbraced or cantilever monoplane wing.  Improved structural techniques, better materials and the quest for greater speed made the biplane configuration obsolete for most purposes by the late 1930s. Biplanes offer several advantages over conventional cantilever monoplane designs: they permit lighter wing structures, low wing loading and smaller span for a given wing area. 

Ignacy Krasicki<====>49202<====>Ignacy Krasicki Ignacy Krasicki (3 February 1735 14 March 1801), from 1766 Prince-Bishop of Warmia (in German, Ermland) and from 1795 Archbishop of Gniezno (thus, Primate of Poland), was Poland's leading Enlightenment poet "Ignacy Krasicki", Encyklopedia Polski (Encyclopedia of Poland), p.  325.   ("the Prince of Poets"), a critic of the clergy,  Poland's La Fontaine, author of the first Polish novel, playwright, journalist, encyclopedist, and translator from French and Greek. His most notable literary works were his Fables and Parables (1779), Satires (1779), and poetic letters and religious lyrics, in which the artistry of his poetic language reached its summit.

Carburetor<====>49209<====>Carburetor A carburetor (American English) or carburettor (British English; see spelling differences) is a device that mixes air and fuel for internal combustion engines in the proper ratio for combustion.  It is sometimes colloquially shortened to carb in the UK and North America or carby in Australia.   To carburate or carburet (and thus carburation or carburetion, respectively) means to mix the air and fuel or to equip (an engine) with a carburetor for that purpose.  Carburetors have largely been supplanted in the automotive and, to a lesser extent, aviation industries by fuel injection.  They are still common on small engines for lawn mowers, rototillers and other equipment. 

Clef<====>49214<====>Clef   A clef (from French:   "key") is a musical symbol used to indicate the pitch of written notes.   Placed on one of the lines at the beginning of the stave, it indicates the name and pitch of the notes on that line.  This line serves as a reference point by which the names of the notes on any other line or space of the stave may be determined.    Only one clef that references a note in a space rather than on a line has ever been used. There are three types of clef used in modern music notation: F, C, and G. 

C (musical note)<====>49220<====>C (musical note) C ( ,  ,  ) is the first note of the C major scale, the third note of the A minor scale (the relative minor of C major), and the fourth note (Γ, A, B, C) of the Guidonian hand, commonly pitched around 261. 63 Hz.  The actual frequency has depended on historical pitch standards, and for transposing instruments a distinction is made between written and sounding or concert pitch. In English the term Do is used interchangeably with C only by adherents of fixed-Do solfège; in the movable Do system Do refers to the tonic of the prevailing key. 

Staff (music)<====>49229<====>Staff (music)In Western musical notation, the staff (US) or stave (UK)  (plural for either: staves) is a set of five horizontal lines and four spaces that each represent a different musical pitch—or, in the case of a percussion staff, different percussion instruments.  Appropriate music symbols, depending on the intended effect, are placed on the staff according to their corresponding pitch or function.  Musical notes are placed by pitch, percussion notes are placed by instrument, and rests and other symbols are placed by convention. The absolute pitch of each line of a non-percussive staff is indicated by the placement of a clef symbol at the appropriate vertical position on the left-hand side of the staff (possibly modified by conventions for specific instruments). 

Chromatic scale<====>49234<====>Chromatic scale The chromatic scale is a musical scale with twelve pitches, each a semitone above or below another.  On a modern piano or other equal-tempered instrument, all the semitones have the same size (100 cents).  In other words, the notes of an equal-tempered chromatic scale are equally spaced.  An equal-tempered chromatic scale is a nondiatonic scale having no tonic because of the symmetry of its equally spaced notes.  Benward & Saker (2003).  Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol.  I, p. 47.  Seventh Edition.   .  The most common conception of the chromatic scale before the 13th century was the Pythagorean chromatic scale.

He played a significant role in the transformation of the Congo from a colony of Belgium into an independent republic.  Ideologically an African nationalist and Pan-Africanist, he led the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC) party from 1958 until his death. Shortly after Congolese independence in 1960, a mutiny broke out in the army, marking the beginning of the Congo Crisis.

Best known for his orchestral suite The Planets, he composed a large number of other works across a range of genres, although none achieved comparable success.  His distinctive compositional style was the product of many influences, Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss being most crucial early in his development.  The subsequent inspiration of the English folksong revival of the early 20th century, and the example of such rising modern composers as Maurice Ravel, led Holst to develop and refine an individual style. 

Irina Privalova<====>49242<====>Irina Privalova Irina Anatolyevna Privalova ( ;   Sergeyeva on 22 November 1968) is a Russian athlete who has won a gold medal at the Olympics. She first competed in the sprint events, winning two Olympic medals in the 100 m and 200 m in 1992 whilst representing the Unified Team.  Irina Privalova had been a formidable competitor during most of the 1990s but had not yet won an outdoor world championship gold medal.  In 2000, she gambled successfully and switched to the 400 m hurdles discipline winning the Olympic title in Sydney 2000 in 53. 02 s and a bronze in the 4 x 400 m relay team for Russia. 

The Planets<====>49243<====>The Planets    The Planets, Op.  32, is a seven-movement orchestral suite by the English composer Gustav Holst, written between 1914 and 1916.  Each movement of the suite is named after a planet of the Solar System and its corresponding astrological character as defined by Holst. From its premiere to the present day, the suite has been enduringly popular, influential, widely performed and frequently recorded.  The work was not heard in a complete public performance, however, until some years after it was completed.  Although there were four performances between September 1918 and October 1920, they were all either private (the first performance, in London) or incomplete (two others in London and one in Birmingham). 

NaN<====>49244<====>NaN  In computing, NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations.  Systematic use of NaNs was introduced by the IEEE 754 floating-point standard in 1985, along with the representation of other non-finite quantities like infinities. Two separate kinds of NaNs are provided, termed quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs.   Quiet NaNs are used to propagate errors resulting from invalid operations or values, whereas signaling NaNs can support advanced features such as mixing numerical and symbolic computation or other extensions to basic floating-point arithmetic. 

Biological determinism<====>49246<====>Biological determinismBiological determinism or genetic determinism  is the belief that human behaviour is controlled by an individual's genes or some component of their physiology, generally at the expense of the role of the environment, whether in embryonic development or in learning.   It has been associated with movements in science and society including eugenics, scientific racism, the supposed heritability of IQ, the supposed biological basis for gender roles, and the sociobiology debate. In 1892 August Weismann proposed that heritable information is transmitted only via germ cells, which he thought contained determinants (genes).  Francis Galton, supposing that undesirable traits such as club foot and criminality were inherited, advocated eugenics, aiming to prevent supposedly defective people from breeding. 

Byron White<====>49248<====>Byron White   Byron Raymond "Whizzer" White (June 8, 1917 – April 15, 2002) won fame both as an American football halfback and as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.Born and raised in Colorado, he played college football, basketball, and baseball for the University of Colorado, finishing as the runner up for the Heisman Trophy in 1937.  He was selected in the first round of the 1938 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates and led the National Football League in rushing yards in his rookie season.  White was admitted to Yale Law School in 1939 and played for the Detroit Lions in the 1940 and 1941 seasons. 

Dili<====>49251<====>DiliDili (Portuguese/Tetum: Díli, Indonesian: Kota Dili) is the capital, largest city, chief port and commercial centre of Timor-Leste (East Timor).  Dili part of a free trade zone the Timor Leste–Indonesia–Australia Growth Triangle (TIA-GT).  Geography and administrationDili lies on the northern coast of Timor island, the easternmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands.  It is the seat of the administration of the municipality of Dili, which is the administrative entity of the area and includes the island of Atauro and some cities close to Dili city.  The city is divided into the Administrative Posts (formerly subdistricts) of Nain Feto, Vera Cruz, Dom Aleixo and Cristo Rei and is divided into several sucos, each of which is headed by an elected chefe de suco. 

Urysohn's lemma<====>49253<====>Urysohn's lemmaIn topology, Urysohn's lemma is a lemma that states that a topological space is normal if and only if any two disjoint closed subsets can be separated by a continuous function.  Urysohn's lemma is commonly used to construct continuous functions with various properties on normal spaces.  It is widely applicable since all metric spaces and all compact Hausdorff spaces are normal.  The lemma is generalized by (and usually used in the proof of) the Tietze extension theorem. The lemma is named after the mathematician Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn. Formal statementTwo subsets A and B of a topological space X are said to be separated by neighbourhoods if there are neighbourhoods U of A and V of B that are disjoint. 

Age of the Earth<====>49256<====>Age of the Earth   The age of the Earth is approximately 4. 54 ± 0. 05 billion years This dating is based on evidence from radiometric age-dating of meteorite  material and is consistent with the radiometric ages of the oldest-known terrestrial and lunar samples. Following the development of radiometric age-dating in the early 20th century, measurements of lead in uranium-rich minerals showed that some were in excess of a billion years old.    For the abstract, see:   The oldest such minerals analyzed to date—small crystals of zircon from the Jack Hills of Western Australia—are at least 4. 

Digital audio broadcasting<====>49257<====>Digital audio broadcastingDigital audio broadcasting (DAB) is a digital radio standard for broadcasting digital audio radio services, used in countries across Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific. The DAB standard was initiated as a European research project in the 1980s.   The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) launched the first DAB channel in the world on 1 June 1995 (NRK Klassisk),  and the BBC and Swedish Radio (SR) launched their first DAB digital radio broadcasts in September 1995.  DAB receivers have been available in many countries since the end of the 1990s. DAB is more efficient in its use of spectrum than analogue FM radio, and thus may offer more radio services for the same given bandwidth. 

Willy Brandt<====>49260<====>Willy Brandt   Willy Brandt ( ; born Herbert Ernst Karl Frahm; 18 December 1913 – 8 October 1992) was a German statesman who was leader of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) from 1964 to 1987 and served as Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) from 1969 to 1974.  He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971 for his efforts to strengthen cooperation in western Europe through the EEC and to achieve reconciliation between West Germany and the countries of Eastern Europe.   He was the first Social Democrat chancellor  since 1930. 

Corporate personhood<====>49261<====>Corporate personhood Corporate personhood is the legal notion that a corporation, separately from its associated human beings (like owners, managers, or employees), has at least some of the legal rights and responsibilities enjoyed by natural persons (physical humans).For example, corporations have the right to enter into contracts with other parties and to sue or be sued in court in the same way as natural persons or unincorporated associations of persons.   In a U. S.  historical context, the phrase 'Corporate Personhood' refers to the ongoing legal debate over the extent to which rights traditionally associated with natural persons should also be afforded to corporations. 

Lake Baringo<====>49263<====>Lake Baringo Lake Baringo is, after Lake Turkana, the most northern of the Kenyan Rift Valley lakes, with a surface area of about   and an elevation of about  .  The lake is fed by several rivers, Molo, Perkerra and Ol Arabel, and has no obvious outlet; the waters are assumed to seep through lake sediments into the faulted volcanic bedrock.  It is one of the two freshwater lakes in the Rift Valley in Kenya, the other being Lake Naivasha.  See "Kenya designates freshwater lake in Great Rift Valley," at Ramsar 2009 - 2002.  It lies off the beaten track in a hot and dusty setting and over 470 species of birds have been recorded there, occasionally including migrating flamingos. 

Buchenwald concentration camp<====>49266<====>Buchenwald concentration camp  Buchenwald concentration camp (German: Konzentrationslager (KZ) Buchenwald,  ; literally, in English: beech forest) was a German Nazi concentration camp established on Ettersberg hill near Weimar, Germany, in July 1937, one of the first and the largest of the concentration camps on German soil, following Dachau's opening just over four years earlier. Prisoners from all over Europe and the Soviet Union—Jews, Poles and other Slavs, the mentally ill and physically-disabled from birth defects, religious and political prisoners, Roma and Sinti, Freemasons, Jehovah's Witnesses (then called Bible Students), criminals, homosexuals, and prisoners of war—worked primarily as forced labor in local armaments factories.

Brought up by artistic parents, Jansson studied art from 1930 to 1938 in Stockholm, Helsinki and then Paris.  Her first solo art exhibition was in 1943.  At the same time, she was writing short stories and articles for publication, as well as creating the graphics for book covers and other purposes.  She continued to work as an artist for the rest of her life, alongside her writing. 

Hydronium<====>49281<====>Hydronium In chemistry, hydronium is the common name for the aqueous cation  , the type of oxonium ion produced by protonation of water.   It is the positive ion present when an Arrhenius acid is dissolved in water, as Arrhenius acid molecules in solution give up a proton (a positive hydrogen ion, H + ) to the surrounding water molecules (H 2 O). Determination of pHThe amount of hydronium ions relative to hydroxide ions determines a solution's pH.   The molecules in pure water auto-dissociate (i. e. : react with each other) into hydronium and hydroxide ions in the following equilibrium:2  +  In pure water, there is an equal number of hydroxide and hydronium ions, so it is a neutral solution. 

Methylchloroisothiazolinone<====>49284<====>Methylchloroisothiazolinone Methylchloroisothiazolinone (5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one), also referred to as MCI, is a preservative with antibacterial and antifungal effects within the group of isothiazolinones.  It is effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeast, and fungi. Methylchloroisothiazolinone is found in many water-based personal care products and cosmetics.   Methylchloroisothiazolinone was first used in cosmetics in the 1970s.  It is also used in glue production, detergents, paints, fuels, and other industrial processes.  Methylchloroisothiazolinone is known by the registered tradename Kathon CG when used in combination with methylisothiazolinone.  Methylchloroisothiazolinone may be used in combination with other preservatives including ethylparaben, benzalkonium chloride, or 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol.

She is named after British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill.  This ship is the 31st destroyer of her class.  Winston S.  Churchill was the 18th ship of this class to be built at Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, and construction began on 7 May 1998.  She was launched and christened on 17 April 1999.  On 10 March 2001, she was commissioned during a ceremony at Town Point Park in Norfolk, Virginia. 

Fine-structure constant<====>49295<====>Fine-structure constant  In physics, the fine-structure constant, also known as Sommerfeld's constant, commonly denoted α (the Greek letter alpha), is a fundamental physical constant characterizing the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between elementary charged particles.  It is related to the elementary charge e, which characterizes the strength of the coupling of an elementary charged particle with the electromagnetic field, by the formula  . Being a dimensionless quantity, it has the same numerical value of about   in all systems of units. DefinitionSome equivalent definitions of α in terms of other fundamental physical constants are: \alpha = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{\hbar c} = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{e^2 c}{\hbar} = \frac{k_\text{e} e^2}{\hbar c} = \frac{c \mu_0}{2 R_\text{K}} = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi}\frac{Z_0}{\hbar} where:e is the elementary charge;π is the mathematical constant pi;ħ = h/2π is the reduced Planck constant;c is the speed of light in vacuum;ε 0  is the electric constant or permittivity of free space;µ 0  is the magnetic constant or permeability of free space;k e  is the Coulomb constant;R K  is the von Klitzing constant;Z 0  is the vacuum impedance or impedance of free space.The definition reflects the relationship between α and the elementary charge e, which equals  .In non-SI unitsIn electrostatic cgs units, the unit of electric charge, the statcoulomb, is defined so that the Coulomb constant, k e , or the permittivity factor, 4πε 0 , is 1 and dimensionless. Then the expression of the fine-structure constant, as commonly found in older physics literature, becomes \alpha = \frac{e^2}{\hbar c}.  In natural units, commonly used in high energy physics, where  , the value of the fine-structure constant is\alpha = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi}.  As such, the fine-structure constant is just another, albeit dimensionless, quantity determining (or determined by) the elementary charge:   in terms of such a natural unit of charge.MeasurementThe 2014 CODATA recommended value of α is\alpha = \frac{e^2}{(4 \pi \varepsilon_0) \hbar c} =  .This has a relative standard uncertainty of 0.23 parts per billion. For reasons of convenience, historically the value of the reciprocal of the fine-structure constant is often specified. The 2014 CODATA recommended value is given by   \alpha^{-1} =   .While the value of α can be estimated from the values of the constants appearing in any of its definitions, the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a way to measure α directly using the quantum Hall effect or the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. The theory of QED predicts a relationship between the dimensionless magnetic moment of the electron and the fine-structure constant α (the magnetic moment of the electron is also referred to as "Landé g-factor" and symbolized as g). The most precise value of α obtained experimentally (as of 2012) is based on a measurement of g using a one-electron so-called "quantum cyclotron" apparatus, together with a calculation via the theory of QED that involved 12,672 tenth-order Feynman diagrams:    \alpha^{-1} =    .This measurement of α has a precision of 0.25 parts per billion. This value and uncertainty are about the same as the latest experimental results.   Physical interpretationsThe fine-structure constant, α, has several physical interpretations. α is:The square of the ratio of the elementary charge to the Planck charge \alpha = \left( \frac{e}{q_\text{P}} \right)^2. The ratio of two energies: (i) the energy needed to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between two electrons a distance of d apart, and (ii) the energy of a single photon of wavelength  \lambda = 2\pi d  (or of angular wavelength d ; see Planck relation): \alpha = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 d} \left/ \frac{h c}{\lambda} \right.= \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 d} \times {\frac{2 \pi d}{h c}} = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 d} \times {\frac{d}{\hbar c}} = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 \hbar c}. The ratio of the velocity of the electron in the first circular orbit of the Bohr model of the atom, which is  \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{\hbar}   to the speed of light in vacuum, c.  This is Sommerfeld's original physical interpretation. Then the square of α is the ratio between the Hartree energy (    approximately twice its ionization energy) and the electron rest energy (511 keV).The two ratios of three characteristic lengths: the classical electron radius  r_\text{e} , the Compton wavelength of the electron  \lambda_\text{e} , and the Bohr radius  a_0 : r_\text{e} = {\alpha \lambda_\text{e} \over 2\pi} = \alpha^2 a_0 In quantum electrodynamics, α is directly related to the coupling constant determining the strength of the interaction between electrons and photons.  The theory does not predict its value. Therefore, α must be determined experimentally. In fact, α is one of about 20 empirical parameters in the Standard Model of particle physics, whose value is not determined within the Standard Model.In the electroweak theory unifying the weak interaction with electromagnetism, α is absorbed into two other coupling constants associated with the electroweak gauge fields. In this theory, the electromagnetic interaction is treated as a mixture of interactions associated with the electroweak fields. The strength of the electromagnetic interaction varies with the strength of the energy field.Given two hypothetical point particles each of Planck mass and elementary charge, separated by any distance, α is the ratio of their electrostatic repulsive force to their gravitational attractive force.In the fields of electrical engineering and solid-state physics, the fine-structure constant is one fourth the product of the characteristic impedance of free space,  , and the conductance quantum,  : \alpha = \tfrac{1}{4} Z_0 G_0 .The optical conductivity of graphene for visible frequencies is theoretically given by  , and as a result its light absorption and transmission properties can be expressed in terms of the fine structure constant alone.    The absorption value for normal-incident light on graphene in vacuum would then be given by   or 2.24%, and the transmission by   or 97.75% (experimentally observed to be between 97.6% and 97.8%).The fine-structure constant gives the maximum positive charge of an atomic nucleus that will allow a stable electron-orbit around it within the Bohr model (element feynmanium).  For an electron orbiting an atomic nucleus with atomic number Z, mv 2 /r = 1/4πε 0  (Ze 2 /r 2 ). The Heisenberg uncertainty principle momentum/position uncertainty relationship of such an electron is just mvr = ħ. The relativistic limiting value for v is c, and so the limiting value for Z is the reciprocal of the fine-structure constant, 137. The magnetic moment of the electron indicates that the charge is circulating at a radius  r_Q  with the velocity of light.  It generates the radiation energy  {m_e}c^2  and has an angular momentum L = 1 ħ =  {r_Q}{m_e}c . The field energy of the stationary Coulomb field is  {m_e}c^2 = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 r_e}   and defines the classical electron radius  r_e . These values inserted into the definition of alpha yields  \alpha = \frac{r_e}{r_Q} . It compares the dynamic structure of the electron with the classical static assumption.Alpha is related to the probability that an electron will emit or absorb a photon. Some properties of subatomic particles exhibit a relation with alpha  ,   suggesting an approximation by the two gamma functions  \Gamma(1/3) |\Gamma(-1/3)| \approx \alpha^{-1}/(4\pi) .When perturbation theory is applied to quantum electrodynamics, the resulting perturbative expansions for physical results are expressed as sets of power series in α. Because α is much less than one, higher powers of α are soon unimportant, making the perturbation theory practical in this case. On the other hand, the large value of the corresponding factors in quantum chromodynamics makes calculations involving the strong nuclear force extremely difficult.Variation with energy scaleAccording to the theory of the renormalization group, the value of the fine-structure constant (the strength of the electromagnetic interaction) grows logarithmically as the energy scale is increased. The observed value of α is associated with the energy scale of the electron mass; the electron is a lower bound for this energy scale because it (and the positron) is the lightest charged object whose quantum loops can contribute to the running. Therefore, 1/137.036 is the value of the fine-structure constant at zero energy. Moreover, as the energy scale increases, the strength of the electromagnetic interaction approaches that of the other two fundamental interactions, a fact important for grand unification theories. If quantum electrodynamics were an exact theory, the fine-structure constant would actually diverge at an energy known as the Landau pole. This fact makes quantum electrodynamics inconsistent beyond the perturbative expansions.HistoryBased on the precise measurement of the H-atom spectrum by Michelson and Morley    Arnold Sommerfeld extended the Bohr model to include elliptical orbits and relativistic dependence of mass on velocity, introducing the term for the fine-structure constant in 1916  . The first physical interpretation of the fine-structure constant α was as the ratio of the velocity of the electron in the first circular orbit of the relativistic Bohr atom to the speed of light in the vacuum.  Equivalently, it was the quotient between the minimum angular momentum allowed by relativity for a closed orbit, and the minimum angular momentum allowed for it by quantum mechanics. It appears naturally in Sommerfeld's analysis, and determines the size of the splitting or fine-structure of the hydrogenic spectral lines.With the development of quantum electrodynamics (QED) the significance of α has broadened from a spectroscopic phenomenon to a general coupling constant for the electromagnetic field, determining the strength of the interaction between electrons and photons. The term  \frac{\alpha}{2\pi}   is engraved on the tombstone of one of the pioneers of QED, Julian Schwinger, referring to his calculation of the anomalous magnetic dipole moment.Is the fine-structure constant actually constant? Physicists have pondered whether the fine-structure constant is in fact constant, or whether its value differs by location and over time. A varying α has been proposed as a way of solving problems in cosmology and astrophysics.    String theory and other proposals for going beyond the Standard Model of particle physics have led to theoretical interest in whether the accepted physical constants (not just α) actually vary.In the experiments below, delta-alpha, or  {\Delta \alpha} , represents the change in alpha over time, which can be computed by  {\alpha _\mathrm{prev}-\alpha _\mathrm{now}} . If the fine-structure constant really is a constant, then any experiment should show that  \frac{\Delta \alpha}{\alpha} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{\alpha _\mathrm{prev}-\alpha _\mathrm{now}}{\alpha_\mathrm{now}}=0 , or be as close to zero as that experiment can measure. Any value far away from zero would indicate that  {\alpha}  does change over time. So far, most experimental data is consistent with  {\alpha}  being constant.Past rate of changeThe first experimenters to test whether the fine-structure constant might actually vary examined the spectral lines of distant astronomical objects and the products of radioactive decay in the Oklo natural nuclear fission reactor. Their findings were consistent with no variation in the fine-structure constant between these two vastly separated locations and times.   Improved technology at the dawn of the 21st century made it possible to probe the value of α at much larger distances and to a much greater accuracy. In 1999, a team led by John K. Webb of the University of New South Wales claimed the first detection of a variation in α.    Using the Keck telescopes and a data set of 128 quasars at redshifts 0.5  \frac{\Delta \alpha}{\alpha} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{\alpha _\mathrm{prev}-\alpha _\mathrm{now}}{\alpha_\mathrm{now}}=\left(-5.7\pm 1.0 \right) \times 10^{-6}. In other words, they measured the value to be somewhere between −0.0000047 and −0.0000067. This is a very small value, nearly zero, but their error bars do not actually include zero. This result either indicates that α is not constant or that there is experimental error that the experimenters did not know how to measure.In 2004, a smaller study of 23 absorption systems by Chand et al., using the Very Large Telescope, found no measurable variation:   \frac{\Delta \alpha}{\alpha_\mathrm{em}}=\left(-0.6\pm 0.6\right) \times 10^{-6}. However, in 2007 simple flaws were identified in the analysis method of Chand et al., discrediting those results.  King et al. have used Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to investigate the algorithm used by the UNSW group to determine  \Delta\alpha/\alpha  from the quasar spectra, and have found that the algorithm appears to produce correct uncertainties and maximum likelihood estimates for  \Delta\alpha/\alpha  for particular models.  This suggests that the statistical uncertainties and best estimate for  \Delta\alpha/\alpha  stated by Webb et al. and Murphy et al. are robust.Lamoreaux and Torgerson analyzed data from the Oklo natural nuclear fission reactor in 2004, and concluded that α has changed in the past 2 billion years by 45 parts per billion. They claimed that this finding was "probably accurate to within 20%". Accuracy is dependent on estimates of impurities and temperature in the natural reactor. These conclusions have to be verified.    In 2007, Khatri and Wandelt of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign realized that the 21 cm hyperfine transition in neutral hydrogen of the early universe leaves a unique absorption line imprint in the cosmic microwave background radiation.    They proposed using this effect to measure the value of α during the epoch before the formation of the first stars. In principle, this technique provides enough information to measure a variation of 1 part in   (4 orders of magnitude better than the current quasar constraints). However, the constraint which can be placed on α is strongly dependent upon effective integration time, going as t −1/2 . The European LOFAR radio telescope would only be able to constrain Δα/α to about 0.3%.  The collecting area required to constrain Δα/α to the current level of quasar constraints is on the order of 100 square kilometers, which is economically impracticable at the present time.Present rate of changeIn 2008, Rosenband et al.  used the frequency ratio of   and   in single-ion optical atomic clocks to place a very stringent constraint on the present time temporal variation of α, namely   per year. Note that any present day null constraint on the time variation of alpha does not necessarily rule out time variation in the past. Indeed, some theories  that predict a variable fine-structure constant also predict that the value of the fine-structure constant should become practically fixed in its value once the universe enters its current dark energy-dominated epoch.Spatial variation – Australian dipoleIn September 2010 researchers from Australia said they had identified a dipole-like structure in the variation of the fine-structure constant across the observable universe. They used data on quasars obtained by the Very Large Telescope, combined with the previous data obtained by Webb at the Keck telescopes. The fine-structure constant appears to have been larger by one part in 100,000 in the direction of the southern hemisphere constellation Ara, 10 billion years ago. Similarly, the constant appeared to have been smaller by a similar fraction in the northern direction, 10 billion years ago.   In September and October 2010, after Webb's released research, physicists Chad Orzel and Sean M. Carroll suggested various approaches of how Webb's observations may be wrong. Orzel argues  that the study may contain wrong data due to subtle differences in the two telescopes, in which one of the telescopes the data set was slightly high and on the other slightly low, so that they cancel each other out when they overlapped. He finds it suspicious that the sources showing the greatest changes are all observed by one telescope, with the region observed by both telescopes aligning so well with the sources where no effect is observed.  Carroll suggested  a totally different approach; he looks at the fine-structure constant as a scalar field and claims that if the telescopes are correct and the fine-structure constant varies smoothly over the universe, then the scalar field must have a very small mass. However, previous research has shown that the mass is not likely to be extremely small. Both of these scientists' early criticisms point to the fact that different techniques are needed to confirm or contradict the results, as Webb, et al., also concluded in their study.In October 2011, Webb et al. reported a variation in α dependent on both redshift and spatial direction. They report "the combined data set fits a spatial dipole" with an increase in α with redshift in one direction and a decrease in the other.  "Independent VLT and Keck samples give consistent dipole directions and amplitudes...." Anthropic explanationThe anthropic principle is a controversial argument of why the fine-structure constant has the value it does: stable matter, and therefore life and intelligent beings, could not exist if its value were much different. For instance, were α to change by 4%, stellar fusion would not produce carbon, so that carbon-based life would be impossible. If α were > 0.1, stellar fusion would be impossible and no place in the universe would be warm enough for life as we know it. Calculation using quantum micro black holesJ. P. Lestone of Los Alamos National Laboratory has suggested an approach to calculating the fine structure constant by extrapolating the concept of virtual particles to virtual cross sections that might require quantum micro black holes or some similar phenomena.    However, the calculational approach might suggest a violation of Einstein's equivalence principle.Numerological explanations and multiverse theoryAs a dimensionless constant which does not seem to be directly related to any mathematical constant, the fine-structure constant has long fascinated physicists.Arthur Eddington argued that the value could be "obtained by pure deduction" and he related it to the Eddington number, his estimate of the number of protons in the universe.  This led him in 1929 to conjecture that the fine-structure constant's reciprocal was precisely the integer 137. Other physicists neither adopted this conjecture nor accepted his arguments but by the 1940s experimental values for 1/α deviated sufficiently from 137 to refute Eddington's argument. The fine-structure constant so intrigued physicist Wolfgang Pauli that he collaborated with psychoanalyst Carl Jung in a quest to understand its significance.  Similarly, Max Born believed that would the value of alpha differ, the universe would degenerate. Thus, he asserted that 1/137 is a law of nature. Richard Feynman, one of the originators and early developers of the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED), referred to the fine-structure constant in these terms: Conversely, statistician I. J. Good argued that a numerological explanation would only be acceptable if it came from a more fundamental theory that also provided a Platonic explanation of the value. Attempts to find a mathematical basis for this dimensionless constant have continued up to the present time. However, no numerological explanation has ever been accepted by the community.In the early 21st century, multiple physicists, including Stephen Hawking in his book A Brief History of Time, began exploring the idea of a multiverse, and the fine-structure constant was one of several universal constants that suggested the idea of a fine-tuned universe.

Haidinger's brush<====>49298<====>Haidinger's brushHaidinger's brush is an entoptic phenomenon first described by Austrianphysicist Wilhelm Karl von Haidinger in 1844. Many people are able to perceive polarization of light. It may be seen as a yellowish horizontal bar or bow-tie shape (with "fuzzy" ends, hence the name "brush") visible in the center of the visual field against the blue sky viewed while facing away from the sun, or on any bright background.   It typically occupies roughly 3–5 degrees of vision, about twice or three times the width of one's thumb held at arm's length.   The direction of light polarization is perpendicular to the yellow bar (i. 

Nellie Tayloe Ross<====>49299<====>Nellie Tayloe Ross  Nellie Davis Tayloe Ross (November 29, 1876 – December 19, 1977) was an American politician, the 14th Governor of Wyoming from 1925 to 1927 and director of the United States Mint from 1933 to 1953.  She was the first woman to be sworn in as governor of a U. S.  state, and remains the only woman to have served as governor of Wyoming.    Ross was born in St.  Joseph, Missouri    to James Wynn Tayloe, a native of Tennessee, and Elizabeth Blair Green, who owned a plantation on the Missouri River. 

Isabella of Angoulême<====>49300<====>Isabella of Angoulême Isabella of Angoulême ( ,  ; c.  1188 – 4 June 1246) was queen consort of England as the second wife of King John from 1200 until John's death in 1216.  She was also suo jure  Countess of Angoulême from 1202 until 1246. She had five children by the king, including his heir, later Henry III.  In 1220, Isabella married Hugh X of Lusignan, Count of La Marche, by whom she had another nine children. Some of her contemporaries, as well as later writers, claim that Isabella formed a conspiracy against King Louis IX of France in 1241, after being publicly snubbed by his mother, Blanche of Castile, for whom she had a deep-seated hatred. 

Pope Eleutherius<====>49302<====>Pope Eleutherius   Pope Eleutherius (died 189), also known as Eleutherus, was the Bishop of Rome from c.  174 to his death.(The Vatican cites 171 or 177 to 185 or 193. ) According to the Liber Pontificalis, he was a Greek born in Nicopolis in Epirus, Greece.His contemporary Hegesippus wrote that he was a deacon of the Roman Church under Pope Anicetus (c.  154–164), and remained so under Pope Soter, whom he succeeded around 174.  Dietary lawThe 6th-century recension of Liber Pontificalis ('Book of the Popes') known as the "Felician Catalog"  includes additional commentary to the work's earlier entry on Eleutherius. 

Henry Morton Stanley<====>49304<====>Henry Morton StanleySir Henry Morton Stanley, GCB (born John Rowlands; 28 January 1841 – 10 May 1904) was a Welsh-American   journalist and explorer who was famous for his exploration of central Africa and his search for missionary and explorer David Livingstone.  Upon finding Livingstone, Stanley reportedly asked, "Dr.  Livingstone, I presume?" Stanley is also known for his search for the source of the Nile, his work in and development of the Congo Basin region in association with King Leopold II of Belgium, and commanding the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition.  He was knighted in 1899. 

Standing (law)<====>49307<====>Standing (law)In law, standing or locus standi is the term for the ability of a party to demonstrate to the court sufficient connection to and harm from the law or action challenged to support that party's participation in the case.  Standing exists from one of three causes:The party is directly subject to an adverse effect by the statute or action in question, and the harm suffered will continue unless the court grants relief in the form of damages or a finding that the law either does not apply to the party or that the law is void or can be nullified. 

Ripeness<====>49308<====>Ripeness  In United States law, ripeness refers to the readiness of a case for litigation; "a claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all. "  For example, if a law of ambiguous quality has been enacted but never applied, a case challenging that law lacks the ripeness necessary for a decision. The goal is to prevent premature adjudication; if a dispute is insufficiently developed, any potential injury or stake is too speculative to warrant judicial action.  Ripeness issues most usually arise when a plaintiff seeks anticipatory relief, such as an injunction. 

Mootness<====>49309<====>Mootness  In law, the terms moot and mootness have different meanings in British English and American English. In the legal system of the United States, a matter is moot if further legal proceedings with regard to it can have no effect, or events have placed it beyond the reach of the law.   Thereby the matter has been deprived of practical significance or rendered purely academic.  The U. S.  development of this word stems from the practice of moot courts, in which hypothetical or fictional cases were argued as a part of legal education.   These purely academic issues led the U. 

Default (law)<====>49315<====>Default (law) In law, a default is the failure to do something required by law or to appearat a required time in legal proceedings. In the United States, for example, when a party has failed to file meaningful response to pleadings withinthe time allowed, with the result that only one side of a controversy has been presentedto the court, the party who has pleaded a claim for relief and received no response may request entry of default.  In some jurisdictions the court may proceed to enter judgment immediately: others require that the plaintiff file anotice of intent to take the default judgment and serve it on the unresponsive party. 

Clare Martin<====>49316<====>Clare Martin   Clare Majella Martin (born 15 June 1952) is a former Australian journalist and politician.  She was elected to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in a shock by-election win in 1995.  She was appointed Opposition Leader in 1999, and won a surprise victory at the 2001 territory election, becoming the first Australian Labor Party (ALP) and first female Chief Minister of the Northern Territory.   At the 2005 election, she led Territory Labor to the second-largest majority government in the history of the Territory, before resigning as Chief Minister on 26 November 2007. Early lifeMartin was one of ten children.

Unit interval<====>49324<====>Unit interval In mathematics, the unit interval is the closed interval  , that is, the set of all real numbers that are greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1.   It is often denoted   (capital letter   I  ). In addition to its role in real analysis, the unit interval is used to study homotopy theory in the field of topology. In the literature, the term "unit interval" is sometimes applied to the other shapes that an interval from 0 to 1 could take:  ,  , and  . 

Houyhnhnm<====>49325<====>Houyhnhnm    Houyhnhnms are a race of intelligent horses described in the last part of Jonathan Swift's satirical Gulliver's Travels.  The name is pronounced either   or  .   (Swift apparently intended all words of the Houyhnhnm language to echo the neighing of horses. )DescriptionGulliver's visit to the Land of the Houyhnhnms is described in Part IV of his Travels, and its location illustrated on the map at the start of Part IV.  The map shows Houyhnhnms Land to be south of Australia; it indicates Edels Land and Lewins Land to the north, and Nuyts Land to the north-east, on the mainland with the islands of St Francis and St Pieter further east, and Sweers, Maatsuyker and De Wit islands to the east.

Strait of Juan de Fuca<====>49329<====>Strait of Juan de FucaThe Strait of Juan de Fuca (officially named Juan de Fuca Strait in Canada   ) is a large body of water about   long    that is the Salish Sea's outlet to the Pacific Ocean.  The international boundary between Canada and the United States  runs down the center of the Strait. It was named in 1787 by the maritime fur trader Charles William Barkley, captain of the Imperial Eagle, for Juan de Fuca, the Greek navigator who sailed in a Spanish expedition in 1592 to seek the fabled Strait of Anián. 

Spellevator<====>49330<====>Spellevator Spellevator is an educational computer game for the Apple II computer, published by MECC (now part of Mattel's The Learning Company).  It was one of the first commercial games to use the ProDOS operating system.  SummaryThe player controls a dust bunny, which is chased by several vacuum cleaners with different movement patterns.  Everything2 Node on Spellevator  The objective of the level is to grab all the letters and exit through the upper left corner.  The player can pass through an unoccupied elevator (some vacuum cleaners use elevators also) by correctly answering a spelling or vocabulary question. 

Patchwork<====>49331<====>Patchwork Patchwork or "pieced work" is a form of needlework that involves sewing together pieces of fabric into a larger design.  The larger design is usually based on repeating patterns built up with different fabric shapes (which can be different colors).  These shapes are carefully measured and cut, basic geometric shapes making them easy to piece together.  UsesPatchwork is most often used to make quilts, but it can also be used to make bags, wall-hangings, warm jackets, cushion covers, skirts, waistcoats and other items of clothing.  Some textile artists work with patchwork, often combining it with embroidery and other forms of stitchery. 

Needlework<====>49332<====>Needlework  Needlework is decorative sewing and textile arts handicrafts.  Anything that uses a needle for construction can be called needlework.  Needlework may include related textile crafts such as crochet, worked with a hook, or tatting, worked with a shuttle.Similar abilities often transfer well between different varieties of needlework, such as fine motor skill and knowledge of textile fibers.  Some of the same tools may be used in several different varieties of needlework.

Cultural bias<====>49333<====>Cultural bias   Cultural bias is the phenomenon of interpreting and judging phenomena by standards inherent to one's own culture.  The phenomenon is sometimes considered a problem central to social and human sciences, such as economics, psychology, anthropology, and sociology.  Some practitioners of the aforementioned fields have attempted to develop methods and theories to compensate for or eliminate cultural bias. Cultural bias occurs when people of a culture make assumptions about conventions, including conventions of language, notation, proof and evidence.  They are then accused of mistaking these assumptions for laws of logic or nature.  Numerous such biases exist, concerning cultural norms for color, mate selection, concepts of justice, linguistic and logical validity, the acceptability of evidence, and taboos. 

Bipolar junction transistor<====>49338<====>Bipolar junction transistor   |- align = "center"|  || NPN|- align = "center"|  || PNP A bipolar junction transistor (bipolar transistor or BJT) is a type of transistor that uses both electron and hole charge carriers.  In contrast, unipolar transistors, such as field-effect transistors, only use one kind of charge carrier.  For their operation, BJTs use two junctions between two semiconductor types, n-type and p-type. BJTs are manufactured in two types, NPN and PNP, and are available as individual components, or fabricated in integrated circuits, often in large numbers.  The basic function of a BJT is to amplify current. 

Trucker's hitch<====>49351<====>Trucker's hitch  The trucker's hitch is a compound knot commonly used for securing loads on trucks    or trailers.    This general arrangement, using loops and turns in the rope itself to form a crude block and tackle, has long been used to tension lines and is known by multiple names.Knot author Geoffrey Budworth claims the knot can be traced back to the days when  s and hawkers used horse-drawn conveyances to move their wares from place to place.    VariationsThe portion of the trucker's hitch which differs in the following variations is the method used to form the loop which the working end slides through to produce the mechanical advantage. 

Hangman's knot<====>49352<====>Hangman's knot   The hangman's knot or hangman's noose (also known as a collar during the Elizabethan era) is a knot most often associated with its use in hanging a person.  For a hanging, the knot of the rope is typically placed under or just behind the left ear, although the most effective position is just ahead of the ear, beneath the angle of the left lower jaw.  The pull on the knot at the end of the drop levers the jaw and head violently up and to the right, which combines with the jerk of the rope becoming taut to wrench the upper neck vertebrae apart. 

Thief knot<====>49355<====>Thief knot The thief knot  resembles the reef knot (square knot) except that the free, or bitter ends are on opposite sides.   It is said that sailors would secure their belongings in a ditty bag using the thief knot, often with the ends hidden.  If another sailor went through the bag, the odds were high the thief would tie the bag back using the more common reef knot, revealing the tampering, hence the name.   It is difficult to tie by mistake, unlike the granny knot.  The thief knot is much less secure than the already insecure reef knot. 

Turner syndrome<====>49364<====>Turner syndrome  Turner syndrome (TS), also known as 45,X or 45,X0, is a condition in which a female is partly or completely missing an X chromosome.Signs and symptoms vary among those affected.   Often, a short and webbed neck, low-set ears, low hairline at the back of the neck, short stature, and swollen hands and feet are seen at birth.   Typically, they develop menstrual periods and breasts only with hormone treatment, and are unable to have children without reproductive technology.   Heart defects, diabetes, and low thyroid hormone occur more frequently. 

LGM-30 Minuteman<====>49365<====>LGM-30 Minuteman   The LGM-30 Minuteman is a U. S.  land-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), in service with the Air Force Global Strike Command.  As of 2017, the LGM-30G Minuteman III version  is the only land-based ICBM in service in the United States. Development of the Minuteman began in the mid-1950s as the outgrowth of basic research into solid fuel rocket motors which indicated an ICBM based on solids was possible.  Such a missile could stand ready for extended periods of time with little maintenance, and then launch on command.  In comparison, existing U. 

Laurent-Désiré Kabila<====>49367<====>Laurent-Désiré Kabila   Laurent-Désiré Kabila ( ) (November 27, 1939 – January 16, 2001), or simply Laurent Kabila, was a Congolese revolutionary and politician who served as the third President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from May 17, 1997, when he overthrew Mobutu Sese Seko, until his assassination by one of his bodyguards on January 16, 2001.   He was succeeded eight days later by his son Joseph. Early lifeKabila was born to a member of the Luba tribe in Baudoinville, Katanga Province, (now Moba, Tanganyika Province) in the Belgian Congo.  His father was a Luba and his mother was a Lunda. 

1928 Winter Olympics<====>49369<====>1928 Winter Olympics  The 1928 Winter Olympics, officially known as the II Olympic Winter Games (French: Les IIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver) (German: Olympische Winterspiele 1928) (Italian: II Giochi olimpici invernali) (Romansch: Gieus olimpics d'enviern 1928), were a winter multi-sport event which was celebrated February 11–19, 1928 in St.  Moritz, Switzerland.  The 1928 Games were the first true Winter Olympics held on its own as they were not in conjunction with a Summer Olympics.  The preceding 1924 Games were retroactively renamed the inaugural Winter Olympics, though they had been in fact part of the 1924 Summer Olympics. 

Anthony Burgess<====>49370<====>Anthony Burgess    John Anthony Burgess Wilson,   ( ; 25 February 1917 – 22 November 1993) – who published under the pen name Anthony Burgess – was an English writer and composer.  From relatively modest beginnings in a Catholic family in Manchester, he eventually became one of the best known English literary figures of the latter half of the twentieth century. Although Burgess was predominantly a comic writer, his dystopian satire A Clockwork Orange remains his best known novel.   In 1971 it was adapted into a highly controversial film by Stanley Kubrick, which Burgess said was chiefly responsible for the popularity of the book. 

Grid computing<====>49373<====>Grid computingGrid computing is the collection of computer resources from multiple locations to reach a common goal.  The grid can be thought of as a distributed system with non-interactive workloads that involve a large number of files.  Grid computing is distinguished from conventional high-performance computing systems such as cluster computing in that grid computers have each node set to perform a different task/application.  Grid computers also tend to be more heterogeneous and geographically dispersed (thus not physically coupled) than cluster computers.   Although a single grid can be dedicated to a particular application, commonly a grid is used for a variety of purposes.

Larynx<====>49375<====>Larynx  The larynx, commonly called the voice box, is an organ in the top of the neck of tetrapods involved in breathing, producing sound, and protecting the trachea against food aspiration.  The larynx houses the vocal cords, and manipulates pitch and volume, which is essential for phonation.  It is situated just below where the tract of the pharynx splits into the trachea and the esophagus.  The word larynx (plural larynges) comes from a similar Ancient Greek word.  StructureLocationIn adult humans, the larynx is found in the anterior neck at the level of the C3–C6 vertebrae.

Cello (web browser)<====>49390<====>Cello (web browser)   Cello is an early discontinued graphical web browser for Windows 3. 1, developed by Thomas R.  Bruce of the Legal Information Institute at Cornell Law School.  It was released as shareware in 1993. While other browsers ran on various Unix machines, Cello  was the first web browser for Microsoft Windows, using the winsock system to access the Internet.  In addition to the basic Windows, Cello worked on Windows NT 3. 5  and with small modifications on OS/2. 

Affirmative action<====>49392<====>Affirmative action  Affirmative action, also known as reservation in India and Nepal, positive action in the UK, and employment equity (in a narrower context) in Canada and South Africa, is the policy of favoring members of a disadvantaged group who suffer or have suffered from discrimination within a culture.Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has sought to achieve goals such as bridging inequalities in employment and pay, increasing access to education, promoting diversity, and redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances.  The nature of affirmative action policies varies from region to region. 

Office of National Assessments<====>49393<====>Office of National AssessmentsThe Office of National Assessments (ONA) is an Australian statutory intelligence agency established by the Office of National Assessments Act 1977 as an independent statutory body directly accountable to the Prime Minister of Australia and is a portfolio agency of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.   ONA provides all-source assessments on international political, strategic and economic developments to the Prime Minister and the National Security Committee of Cabinet.  ONA also plays a coordination role in the Australian Intelligence Community through evaluating foreign intelligence products, convening the National Intelligence Coordination Committee, and developing relationships with intelligence agencies around world. 

Volunteer (botany)<====>49396<====>Volunteer (botany) In gardening and agronomic terminology, a volunteer is a plant that grows on its own, rather than being deliberately planted by a farmer or gardener.   Volunteers often grow from seeds that float in on the wind, are dropped by birds, or are inadvertently mixed into compost.  Unlike weeds, which are unwanted plants, a volunteer may be encouraged by gardeners once it appears, being watered, fertilized, or otherwise cared for.  The action of such plants – to sprout or grow in this fashion – may also be described as volunteering.  Volunteers that grow from the seeds of specific cultivars are not reliably identical or similar to their parent, and often differ significantly from it. 

Battle of Chosin Reservoir<====>49397<====>Battle of Chosin Reservoir  The Battle of Chosin Reservoir, also known as the Chosin Reservoir Campaign or the Changjin Lake Campaign ( ; hanja: 長津湖戰鬪; rr: Jangjin ho jeontu;  ),  was a decisive battle in the Korean War.  The name "Chosin" is derived from the Japanese pronunciation "Chōshin", instead of Korean pronunciation"Changjin", of the Chinese word 長津.    The battle took place about a month after the People's Republic of China entered the conflict and sent the People's Volunteer Army 9th Army  to infiltrate the northeastern part of North Korea.  On 27 November 1950, the Chinese force surprised the US X Corps commanded by Major General Edward Almond at the Chosin Reservoir area. 

XY sex-determination system<====>49399<====>XY sex-determination system  The XY sex-determination system is the sex-determination system found in humans, most other mammals, some insects (Drosophila), some snakes, and some plants (Ginkgo).  In this system, the sex of an individual is determined by a pair of sex chromosomes (gonosomes).  Females typically have two of the same kind of sex chromosome (XX), and are called the homogametic sex.  Males typically have two different kinds of sex chromosomes (XY), and are called the heterogametic sex.  Exceptions to this are cases of XX males or XY females, or other syndromes. The XY system contrasts in several ways with the ZW sex-determination system found in birds, some insects, many reptiles, and various other animals, in which the heterogametic sex is female. 

Window<====>49400<====>Window   A window is an opening in a wall, door, roof or vehicle that allows the passage of light, sound, and air.  Modern windows are usually glazed or covered in some other transparent or translucent material, a sash set in a frame  in the opening; the sash and frame are also referred to as a window.Many glazed windows may be opened, to allow ventilation, or closed, to exclude inclement weather.  Windows often have a latch or similar mechanism to lock the window shut or to hold it open by various amounts. 

Hall<====>49401<====>Hall  In architecture, a hall is a relatively large space enclosed by a roof and walls.   In the Iron Age, a mead hall was such a simple building and was the residence of a lord and his retainers.  Later, rooms were partitioned from it, and the space next to the front door became the entrance hall.  Today, the (entrance) hall of a house is the space next to the front door or vestibule leading to the rooms directly and/or indirectly.  Where the hall inside the front door of a house is elongated, it may be called a passage, corridor (from Spanish corredor used in El Escorial and 100 years later in Castle Howard) or hallway. 

Closet<====>49402<====>Closet  A closet (especially in North American usage) is an enclosed space, a cabinet, or a cupboard in a house or building used for general storage or hanging or storing clothes. Modern closets can be built into the walls of the house during construction so that they take up no apparent space in the bedroom, or they can be large, free-standing pieces of furniture designed for clothing storage, in which case they are often called wardrobes or armoires.  Closets are often built under stairs, thereby using awkward space that would otherwise go unused. In current British and Pakistan usage, a wardrobe can also be built-in, and the words "cupboard" or "walk-in-wardrobe" can be used to refer to a closet. 

Kitchen<====>49404<====>Kitchen  A kitchen is a room or part of a room used for cooking and food preparation in a dwelling or in a commercial establishment.  In the West, a modern residential kitchen is typically equipped with a stove, a sink with hot and cold running water, a refrigerator, counters and kitchen cabinets arranged according to a modular design.  Many households have a microwave oven, a dishwasher and other electric appliances.  The main function of a kitchen is serving as a location for storing, cooking and preparing food (and doing related tasks such as dishwashing), but it may also be used for dining, entertaining and laundry. 

Pliny the Younger<====>49407<====>Pliny the Younger  Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus, born Gaius Caecilius or Gaius Caecilius Cilo (61 – c.  113), better known as Pliny the Younger ( ), was a lawyer, author, and magistrate of Ancient Rome.  Pliny's uncle, Pliny the Elder, helped raise and educate him.  Both Pliny the Elder and the Younger were witnesses to the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD, in which the former died. Pliny the Younger wrote hundreds of letters, of which 247 survive and are of great historical value.  Some are addressed to reigning emperors or to notables such as the historian Tacitus. 

Sex-determination system<====>49414<====>Sex-determination systemA sex-determination system is a biological system that determines the development of sexual characteristics in an organism.  Most organisms that create their offspring using sexual reproduction have two sexes.  Occasionally, there are hermaphrodites in place of one or both sexes.  There are also some species that are only one sex due to parthenogenesis, the act of a female reproducing without fertilization. In many species, sex determination is genetic: males and females have different alleles or even different genes that specify their sexual morphology.  In animals this is often accompanied by chromosomal differences, generally through combinations of XY, ZW, XO, ZO chromosomes, or haplodiploidy. 

NMOS logic<====>49416<====>NMOS logic N-type metal-oxide-semiconductor logic uses n-type field effect transistors (MOSFETs) to implement logic gates and other digital circuits.  These NMOS transistors operate by creating an inversion layer in a p-type transistor body.  This inversion layer, called the n-channel, can conduct electrons between n-type "source" and "drain" terminals.  The n-channel is created by applying voltage to the third terminal, called the gate.  Like other MOSFETs, NMOS transistors have four modes of operation: cut-off (or subthreshold), triode, saturation (sometimes called active), and velocity saturation. MOS stands for metal-oxide-semiconductor, reflecting the way MOS-transistors were originally constructed, predominantly before the 1970s, with gates of metal, typically aluminium. 

Extinction<====>49417<====>Extinction   In biology and ecology, extinction is the termination of an organism or of a group of organisms (taxon), normally a species.  The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of the species, although the capacity to breed and recover may have been lost before this point.  Because a species' potential range may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively.  This difficulty leads to phenomena such as Lazarus taxa, where a species presumed extinct abruptly "reappears" (typically in the fossil record) after a period of apparent absence.

CMOS<====>49420<====>CMOS Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor, abbreviated as CMOS  , is a technology for constructing integrated circuits.  CMOS technology is used in microprocessors, microcontrollers, static RAM, and other digital logic circuits.  CMOS technology is also used for several analog circuits such as image sensors (CMOS sensor), data converters, and highly integrated transceivers for many types of communication.  In 1963, while working for Fairchild Semiconductor, Frank Wanlass patented CMOS ( ). CMOS is also sometimes referred to as complementary-symmetry metal–oxide–semiconductor (or COS-MOS).  The words "complementary-symmetry" refer to the fact that the typical  design style with CMOS uses complementary and symmetrical pairs of p-type and n-type metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) for logic functions.

Robert Abercromby (Jesuit)<====>49430<====>Robert Abercromby (Jesuit) Father Robert Abercromby (1536 – 27 April 1613), whose surname was also spelled as Abrecromby and Abercrombie, and was known by such pseudonyms as Robert Sandiesoun and Sanders Robertson, was a Scottish Jesuit missionary. Early lifeHe was born and educated in Scotland, and studied in the Collegium Romanum in Rome, where on 19 August 1563 he became a Jesuit.  From 1564 he lived in Braunsberg (then in Royal Prussia; present-day Braniewo, Poland) where he was professor of grammar in the biggest Polish Jesuit collegium (where teaching was in Latin) and a novice master. In 1565 he was ordained a priest. 

Francis Pharcellus Church<====>49431<====>Francis Pharcellus Church Francis Pharcellus Church (February 22, 1839 – April 11, 1906) was an American publisher and editor.  He was a member of the Century Association.  BiographyHe was born in Rochester, New York and graduated from Columbia College of Columbia University in New York City in 1859. With his brother William Conant Church he established The Army and Navy Journal in 1863, and Galaxy magazine in 1866 (merged with Atlantic Monthly after 10 years).   He was a lead editorial writer on his brother's newspaper, the New York Sun, and it was in that capacity that in 1897 he wrote his most famous editorial, "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus". 

Conjunction (astronomy)<====>49434<====>Conjunction (astronomy)In astronomy, a conjunction occurs when two astronomical objects or spacecraft have either the same right ascension or the same ecliptic longitude, usually as observed from Earth.The astronomical symbol for conjunction is ☌ (in Unicode U+260C) and handwritten .  The conjunction symbol is not used in modern astronomy.  It continues to be used in astrology. When two objects always appear close to the ecliptic – such as two planets, the Moon and a planet, or the Sun and a planet – this fact implies an apparent close approach between the objects as seen on the sky. 

Axel Oxenstierna<====>49435<====>Axel Oxenstierna Axel Gustafsson Oxenstierna af Södermöre ( ; 1583–1654) , Count of Södermöre, was a Swedish statesman.He became a member of the Swedish Privy Council in 1609 and served as Lord High Chancellor of Sweden from 1612 until his death.  He was a confidant of first Gustavus Adolphus and then Queen Christina.    Oxenstierna is widely considered one of the most influential people in Swedish history.  He played an important role during the Thirty Years' War and was appointed Governor-General of occupied Prussia; he is also credited for having laid the foundations of the modern central administrative structure of the State, including the creation of counties ( ). 

Religious humanism<====>49443<====>Religious humanism Religious humanism is an integration of humanist ethical philosophy with religious rituals and beliefs that center on human needs, interests, and abilities.  Self-described religious humanists differ from secular humanists mainly in that they regard the humanist life stance as their religion and organise using a congregational model. OriginsHumanism as it was conceived in the early 20th century rejected revealed knowledge, theism-based morality and the supernatural.   In the late 20th century the Humanist movement that affirms the dignity and worth of all people came into conflict with conservative Christian groups in the United States and "Secular Humanism" became the most popular element of organized Humanism. 

Racial quota<====>49444<====>Racial quota Racial quotas in employment and education are numerical requirements for hiring, promoting, admitting and/or graduating members of a particular racial group.  Racial quotas are often established as means of diminishing racial discrimination, addressing under-representation and evident racism against those racial groups or, the opposite, against the disadvantaged majority group (see numerus clausus or bhumiputra systems). It has been argued that such quotas are a form of racial discrimination. These quotas may be determined by governmental authority and backed by governmental sanctions.  When the total number of jobs or enrollment slots is fixed, this proportion may get translated to a specific number. 

Horus<====>49448<====>Horus  Horus is one of the most significant ancient Egyptian deities.  He was worshipped from at least the late prehistoric Egypt until the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Roman Egypt.  Different forms of Horus are recorded in history and these are treated as distinct gods by Egyptologists.  "The Oxford Guide: Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology", Edited by Donald B.  Redford, Horus: by Edmund S.  Meltzer, pp.  164–168, Berkley, 2003,    These various forms may possibly be different perceptions of the same multi-layered deity in which certain attributes or syncretic relationships are emphasized, not necessarily in opposition but complementary to one another, consistent with how the Ancient Egyptians viewed the multiple facets of reality. 

Bayeux Tapestry<====>49451<====>Bayeux Tapestry The Bayeux Tapestry ( ,  ;  ,  , or La telle du conquest;  ) is an embroidered cloth nearly   long and   tall,    which depicts the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England concerning William, Duke of Normandy, and Harold, Earl of Wessex, later King of England, and culminating in the Battle of Hastings.  It is thought to date to the 11th century, within a few years after the battle.  It tells the story from the point of view of the conquering Normans. According to Sylvette Lemagnen, conservator of the tapestry, in her 2005 book La Tapisserie de Bayeux: The tapestry consists of some fifty scenes with Latin tituli, embroidered on linen with coloured woollen yarns. 

Seth<====>49453<====>Seth  Seth ( ;  ;  ; "placed; appointed";  ), in Judaism, Christianity, Mandaeism, and Islam, was the third son of Adam and Eve and brother of Cain and Abel, who were the only other of their children mentioned by name in the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible).  According to  , Seth was born after Abel's murder, and Eve believed God had appointed him as a replacement for Abel. GenesisAccording to Genesis, Seth was born when Adam was 130  years old    "a son in his likeness and image".    The genealogy is repeated at  . 

Jefferson National Expansion Memorial<====>49457<====>Jefferson National Expansion Memorial   The Jefferson National Expansion Memorial is a park located in St.  Louis, Missouri, near the starting point of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.  It was designated as a National Memorial by Executive Order 7523, on December 21, 1935, and is maintained by the National Park Service (NPS). The park was established to commemorate:The Louisiana Purchase, and the subsequent westward movement of American explorers and pioneers;The first civil government west of the Mississippi River; andThe debate over slavery raised by the Dred Scott case. The memorial consists of a   park along the Mississippi River on the site of the earliest buildings of St. 

Boole's syllogistic<====>49460<====>Boole's syllogistic Boolean logic is a system of syllogistic logic invented by 19th-century British mathematician George Boole, which attempts to incorporate the "empty set", that is, a class of non-existent entities, such as round squares, without resorting to uncertain truth values. In Boolean logic, the universal statements "all S is P" and "no S is P" (contraries in the traditional Aristotelian schema) are compossible provided that the set of "S" is the empty set.   "All S is P" is construed to mean that "there is nothing that is both S and not-P"; "no S is P", that "there is nothing that is both S and P". 

Upper and Lower Egypt<====>49463<====>Upper and Lower Egypt In Egyptian history, the Upper and Lower Egypt period (also known as The Two Lands, a name for Ancient Egypt during this time) was the final stage of its prehistory and directly preceded the nation's unification.  The conception of Egypt as the Two Lands was an example of the dualism in ancient Egyptian culture and appeared frequently in texts and imagery, including in the titles of Egyptian kings and queens. The Egyptian expression sema-tawy is usually translated as "The Uniter of the Two Lands"   and was depicted as a human trachea entwined with the papyrus and lily plant. 

Osiris myth<====>49471<====>Osiris myth  The Osiris myth is the most elaborate and influential story in ancient Egyptian mythology.  It concerns the murder of the god Osiris, a primeval king of Egypt, and its consequences.  Osiris's murderer, his brother Set, usurps his throne.  Meanwhile, Osiris's wife Isis restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive a son with her.  The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne.  Their often violent conflict ends with Horus's triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection. 

Das Rheingold<====>49482<====>Das Rheingold   Das Rheingold ( ; The Rhinegold), WWV 86A, is the first of the four music dramas that constitute Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, or in English, 'The Ring of the Nibelung'. Das Rheingold premiered at the National Theatre Munich on 22 September 1869, with August Kindermann in the role of Wotan, Heinrich Vogl as Loge, and Karl Fischer as Alberich.  Wagner wanted this work to premiere as part of the entire cycle, but was forced to allow the performance at the insistence of his patron King Ludwig II of Bavaria.  The work was first performed as part of the complete cycle on 13 August 1876, in the Bayreuth Festspielhaus. 

Volatilisation<====>49484<====>Volatilisation Volatilization is the process whereby a dissolved sample is vaporised.  In atomic spectroscopy this is usually a two-step process.  The analyte is turned into small droplets in a nebuliser which are entrained in a gas flow which is in turn volatilised in a high temperature flame in the case of AAS or volatilised in a gas plasma torch in the case of ICP spectroscopy. Herbicide volatilisationHerbicide volatilisation refers to evaporation or sublimation of a volatile herbicide.  The effect of gaseous chemical is lost at its intended place of application and may move downwind and affect other plants not intended to be affected causing crop damage.

Divisor<====>49492<====>Divisor   In mathematics, a divisor of an integer  n , also called a factor of  n , is an integer  m  that may be multiplied by some integer to produce  n .  In this case one says also that  n  is a multiple of  m.   An integer  n  is divisible by another integer  m  if  m  is a divisor of  n ; this implies dividing  n  by  m  leaves no remainder. DefinitionTwo versions of the definition of a divisor are commonplace:If  m  and  n  are integers, and more generally, elements of an integral domain, it is said that  m  divides  n ,  m  is a divisor of  n , or  n  is a multiple of  m , and this is written as m \mid n, if there exists an integer  k , or an element  k  of the integral domain, such that  mk = n . 

Pascal's triangle<====>49497<====>Pascal's triangleIn mathematics, Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients.  In much of the Western world, it is named after French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although other mathematicians studied it centuries before him in India,  Persia (Iran), China, Germany, and Italy.    The rows of Pascal's triangle are conventionally enumerated starting with row n = 0 at the top (the 0th row).  The entries in each row are numbered from the left beginning with k = 0 and are usually staggered relative to the numbers in the adjacent rows.  The triangle may be constructed in the following manner: In row 0 (the topmost row), there is a unique nonzero entry 1. 

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry<====>49503<====>Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a type of mass spectrometry which is capable of detecting metals and several non-metals at concentrations as low as one part in 10 15  (part per quadrillion, ppq) on non-interfered low-background isotopes.  This is achieved by ionizing the sample with inductively coupled plasma and then using a mass spectrometer to separate and quantify those ions. Compared to atomic absorption spectroscopy, ICP-MS has greater speed, precision, and sensitivity.   However, compared with other types of mass spectrometry, such as thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) and glow discharge mass spectrometry (GD-MS), ICP-MS introduces many interfering species: argon from the plasma, component gases of air that leak through the cone orifices, and contamination from glassware and the cones. 

Die Walküre<====>49508<====>Die Walküre    (The Valkyrie), WWV 86B, is a music drama in three acts by Richard Wagner with a German libretto by the composer.  It is the second of the four works that form Wagner's cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung). The story of Die Walküre is based on the Norse mythology told in the Volsunga Saga and the Poetic Edda.    In Norse mythology, a valkyrie is one in a group of female figures who decide which soldiers die in battle and which live.   's best-known excerpt is the "Ride of the Valkyries". 

Siegfried (opera)<====>49511<====>Siegfried (opera) Siegfried, WWV 86C, is the third of the four music dramas that constitute Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung), by Richard Wagner.  It premiered at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus on 16 August 1876, as part of the first complete performance of The Ring cycle. Background The libretto of Siegfried was drafted by Wagner in November–December 1852, based on an earlier version he had prepared in May–June 1851 and originally entitled Jung-Siegfried (Young Siegfried), later changed to Der junge Siegfried.  The musical composition was commenced in 1856, but not finally completed until 1871.  Millington, (n. 

Bernhard von Reesen<====>49513<====>Bernhard von Reesen Bernhard von Reesen (born ca.  1490) was an art collector born to a patrician family in Danzig (Gdańsk), in Polish Royal Prussia. Reesen received an extensive education as was the custom of that time for men of his background.   As did many other well-off business men and statesmen, at the age of thirty, Reesen commissioned Albrecht Dürer of Nuremberg to paint his portrait in 1520/21.  The painting can still be seen at the exhibit of Old Masters in Dresden, Germany. The Reesen name, with the word "von" (of), indicates that his family had its origins in the city of Rees. 

Henri Lebesgue<====>49514<====>Henri Lebesgue   Henri Léon Lebesgue    ( ; June 28, 1875 – July 26, 1941) was a French mathematician most famous for his theory of integration, which was a generalization of the 17th century concept of integration—summing the area between an axis and the curve of a function defined for that axis.  His theory was published originally in his dissertation Intégrale, longueur, aire ("Integral, length, area") at the University of Nancy during 1902.   Personal lifeHenri Lebesgue was born on 28 June 1875 in Beauvais, Oise.  Lebesgue's father was a typesetter and his mother was a school teacher. 

Anwar Sadat<====>49522<====>Anwar Sadat    	Muhammad Anwar el-Sadat (   ,  Egyptian[muħæmmæd ˈʔɑnwɑɾ essæˈdæːt]; 25 December 1918 – 6 October 1981) was the third President of Egypt, serving from 15 October 1970 until his assassination by fundamentalist army officers on 6 October 1981.  Sadat was a senior member of the Free Officers who overthrew King Farouk in the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, and a close confidant of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, under whom he served as Vice President twice and whom he succeeded as President in 1970. In his eleven years as president, he changed Egypt's trajectory, departing from many of the political and economic tenets of Nasserism, re-instituting a multi-party system, and launching the Infitah economic policy. 

Bayreuth<====>49523<====>Bayreuth   Bayreuth ( ;  ) (Bavarian: Bayreith) is a medium-sized town in northern Bavaria, Germany, on the Red Main river in a valley between the Franconian Jura and the Fichtelgebirge Mountains.  The town's roots date back to 1194.  In the early 21st century, it is the capital of Upper Franconia and has a population of 72,148 (2015).  It is world-famous for its annual Bayreuth Festival, at which performances of operas by the 19th-century German composer Richard Wagner are presented. HistoryMiddle Ages and Early Modern PeriodThe town is believed to have been founded by the counts of Andechs probably around the mid-12th century, Mayer, Bernd and Rückel, Gert (2009).

Scale (ratio)<====>49526<====>Scale (ratio) The scale ratio of a model represents the proportional ratio of a linear dimension of the model to the same feature of the original.  Examples include a 3-dimensional scale model of a building or the scale drawings of the elevations or plans of a building.  In such cases the scale is dimensionless and exact throughout the model or drawing. The scale can be expressed in four ways: in words (a lexical scale), as a ratio, as a fraction  and as a graphical (bar) scale.   Thus on an architect's drawing one might read'one centimetre to  one  metre'    or    1:100   or    1/100and a bar scale would also normally appear on the drawing. 

Baen Free Library<====>49528<====>Baen Free LibraryThe Baen Free Library is a digital library of the science fiction and fantasy publishing house Baen Books where 61 e-books as of June 2016 (112 e-books as of December 2008) can be downloaded free in a number of formats, without copy protection.   It was founded in late 1999 by science fiction writer Eric Flint and publisher Jim Baen to determine whether the availability of books free of charge on the Internet encourages or discourages the sale of their paper books.  The Baen Free Library represents an experiment in the field of intellectual property and copyright. 

Battle of the Milvian Bridge<====>49532<====>Battle of the Milvian Bridge  The Battle of the Milvian Bridge took place between the Roman Emperors Constantine I and Maxentius on October 28, 312.  It takes its name from the Milvian Bridge, an important route over the Tiber.  Constantine won the battle and started on the path that led him to end the Tetrarchy and become the sole ruler of the Roman Empire.  Maxentius drowned in the Tiber during the battle; his body was later taken from the river and decapitated, and his head was paraded through the streets of Rome on the day following the battle. 

Thought experiment<====>49535<====>Thought experimentA thought experiment ( ,  Gedanken-Experiment  or Gedankenerfahrung ) considers some hypothesis, theory,  or principle for the purpose of thinking through its consequences.  Given the structure of the experiment, it may not be possible to perform it, and even if it could be performed, there need not be an intention to perform it. The common goal of a thought experiment is to explore the potential consequences of the principle in question: "A thought experiment is a device with which one performs an intentional, structured process of intellectual deliberation in order to speculate, within a specifiable problem domain, about potential consequents (or antecedents) for a designated antecedent (or consequent)" (Yeates, 2004, p. 

Junichiro Koizumi<====>49544<====>Junichiro Koizumiis a Japanese politician who was the 56th Prime Minister of Japan from 2001 to 2006.  He retired from politics when his term in parliament ended in 2009,  and is the sixth longest serving PM in Japanese history. Widely seen as a maverick leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), he became known as an economic reformer, focusing on Japan's government debt and the privatization of its postal service.  In 2005, Koizumi led the LDP to win one of the largest parliamentary majorities in modern Japanese history.  Koizumi also attracted international attention through his deployment of the Japan Self-Defense Forces to Iraq, and through his visits to Yasukuni Shrine that fueled diplomatic tensions with neighboring China and South Korea. 

Hyperlink<====>49547<====>Hyperlink  In computing, a hyperlink, or simply a link, is a reference to data that the reader can directly follow either by clicking, tapping, or hovering.   A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document.  Hypertext is text with hyperlinks.  The text that is linked from is called anchor text.  A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is a hypertext system, and to create a hyperlink is to hyperlink (or simply to link).  A user following hyperlinks is said to navigate or browse the hypertext. 

Katsura Tarō<====>49549<====>Katsura Tarō    Prince   was a Japanese general in the Imperial Japanese Army, politician and the longest serving Prime Minister of Japan, having served three terms. Early lifeKatsura was born into a samurai family from Hagi, Chōshū Domain (present day Yamaguchi Prefecture).  As a youth, he joined the movement against the Tokugawa shogunate and participated in some of the major battles of the Boshin War that led to the Meiji Restoration. Army careerThe new Meiji government considered that Katsura displayed great talent, and sent him to Germany to study military science.  He served as military attaché at the Japanese embassy in Germany from 1875–1878 and again from 1884-1885. 

Rugby School<====>49551<====>Rugby School    Rugby School is a day and boarding co-educational independent school in Rugby, Warwickshire, England.  It is one of the oldest independent schools in Britain.   Its re-establishment by Thomas Arnold during his time as Headmaster, from 1828 to 1841, was seen as the forerunner of the Victorian Public School.   It is one of the original seven English Public Schools defined by the Public Schools Act 1868.  Total enrolment of day pupils from forms 4 to 12 numbers around 800.    Rugby School was the birthplace of Rugby football. 

Savonlinna<====>49553<====>Savonlinna Savonlinna ( ) is a town and a municipality of   (Error: invalid time)  inhabitants in the southeast of Finland, in the heart of the Saimaa lake region.  The Finnish name of the town means "Castle of Savonia" and the Swedish name means "New Castle". HistoryThe city was founded in 1639, based on Olavinlinna castle.  The castle was founded by Erik Axelsson Tott in 1475 in an effort to protect Savonia and to control the unstable border between the Kingdom of Sweden and its Russian adversary.  During the Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743), the castle was captured by Field-Marshal Peter Lacy. 

Batholith<====>49555<====>Batholith A batholith (from Greek bathos, depth + lithos, rock) is a large mass of intrusive igneous rock (also called plutonic rock) that forms from cooled magma deep in the Earth's crust.  Batholiths are almost always made mostly of felsic or intermediate rock types, such as granite, quartz monzonite, or diorite (see also granite dome). FormationAlthough they may appear uniform, batholiths are in fact structures with complex histories and compositions.  They are composed of multiple masses, or plutons, bodies of igneous rock of irregular dimensions (typically at least several kilometers) that can be distinguished from adjacent igneous rock by some combination of criteria including age, composition, texture, or mappable structures. 

Castle<====>49557<====>Castle   A castle (from  ) is a type of fortified structure built in Europe and the Middle East during the Middle Ages by European nobility.  Scholars debate the scope of the word castle, but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble.  This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for nobility; and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence – though there are many similarities among these types of construction.  Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses. 

Yalu River<====>49559<====>Yalu River    The Yalu River, also called the Amnok River ( ), is a river on the border between North Korea and China.  Together with the Tumen River to its east, and a small portion of Paektu Mountain, the Yalu forms the border between North Korea and China and is notable as a site involved in military conflicts such as the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, World War II, and the Korean War. NameThere are two theories regarding the origin of the river's name.  One theory is that the name derived from "Yalv ula" in the Manchu language. 

Nicolae Ceaușescu<====>49562<====>Nicolae Ceaușescu    Nicolae Ceaușescu ( ; 26 January 1918   – 25 December 1989) was a Romanian Communist politician.  He was general secretary of the Romanian Communist Party from 1965 to 1989, and hence the second and last Communist leader of Romania.  He was also the country's head of state from 1967, serving as President of the State Council, from 1974 concurrently as President of the Republic, until his overthrow in the Romanian Revolution in 1989. Born in 1918 in Scornicești, Olt County, Ceaușescu was a member of the Romanian Communist youth movement.  Ceaușescu rose up through the ranks of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej's Socialist government and, upon Gheorghiu-Dej's death in 1965, he succeeded to the leadership of Romania’s Communist Party as General Secretary.

Bayes' theorem<====>49569<====>Bayes' theorem  In probability theory and statistics, Bayes’ theorem (alternatively Bayes’ law or Bayes' rule) describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.  For example, if cancer is related to age, then, using Bayes’ theorem, a person’s age can be used to more accurately assess the probability that they have cancer, compared to the assessment of the probability of cancer made without knowledge of the person's age. One of the many applications of Bayes' theorem is Bayesian inference, a particular approach to statistical inference.  When applied, the probabilities involved in Bayes' theorem may have different probability interpretations. 

Bayesian inference<====>49571<====>Bayesian inference Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.  Bayesian inference is an important technique in statistics, and especially in mathematical statistics.  Bayesian updating is particularly important in the dynamic analysis of a sequence of data.  Bayesian inference has found application in a wide range of activities, including science, engineering, philosophy, medicine, sport, and law.  In the philosophy of decision theory, Bayesian inference is closely related to subjective probability, often called "Bayesian probability".  Introduction to Bayes' rule  Formal ExplanationBayesian inference derives the posterior probability as a consequence of two antecedents, a prior probability and a "likelihood function" derived from a statistical model for the observed data. 

Hooliganism<====>49572<====>Hooliganism    Hooliganism is disruptive or unlawful behavior such as rioting, bullying, and vandalism, normally used for people that commit the act during a sporting event. EtymologyThere are several theories regarding the origin of the word hooliganism, which is a derivative of the word  .  The Compact Oxford English Dictionary states that the word may have originated from the surname of a rowdy Irish family in a music hall song of the 1890s. Clarence Rook, in his 1899 book, Hooligan Nights, wrote that the word came from Patrick Hoolihan (or Hooligan), an Irish bouncer and thief who lived in London. 

Abbie Hoffman<====>49574<====>Abbie Hoffman  Abbot Howard Hoffman (November 30, 1936 – April 12, 1989) was an American political and social activist, anarchist,    and revolutionary who co-founded the Youth International Party ("Yippies"). Hoffman was arrested and tried for conspiracy and inciting to riot as a result of his role in protests that led to violent confrontations with police during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, along with Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, John Froines, Lee Weiner, and Bobby Seale.  The group was known collectively as the "Chicago Eight"; when Seale's prosecution was separated from the others, they became known as the Chicago Seven. 

Battle of Lewes<====>49582<====>Battle of LewesThe Battle of Lewes was one of two main battles of the conflict known as the Second Barons' War.  It took place at Lewes in Sussex, on 14 May 1264.  It marked the high point of the career of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, and made him the "uncrowned King of England".   Henry III left the safety of Lewes Castle and St.  Pancras Priory to engage the Barons in battle and was initially successful, his son Prince Edward routing part of the baronial army with a cavalry charge. 

Link awareness<====>49583<====>Link awareness Link awareness is defined as the ability to discover, view, search and update global hyperlink information about any resource with a URL on the World Wide Web.   This global link information is a shared information resource. Implementing link awareness is difficult.   In practice, an implementation only approximates link awareness.   There are at least two qualitative axes on which we can classify these implementations. Breadth of Coverage: The number and type of interlinked documents covered. Liveness: The ability (or lack thereof) to update the link information on the fly. Implementation examplesMost WikiWiki implementations support link awareness within the scope of the documents that they host.

He was one of the few officers on either side to enlist as a private and be promoted to general officer and corps commander during the war.  An expert cavalry leader, Forrest was given command of his own unit and established new doctrines for mobile forces, earning the nickname "The Wizard of the Saddle". 

Pigment<====>49598<====>PigmentA pigment is a material that changes the color of reflected or transmitted light as the result of wavelength-selective absorption.  This physical process differs from fluorescence, phosphorescence, and other forms of luminescence, in which a material emits light. Many materials selectively absorb certain wavelengths of light.  Materials that humans have chosen and developed for use as pigments usually have special properties that make them ideal for coloring other materials.  A pigment must have a high tinting strength relative to the materials it colors.  It must be stable in solid form at ambient temperatures. For industrial applications, as well as in the arts, permanence and stability are desirable properties.

Hearing loss<====>49604<====>Hearing loss   Hearing loss, also known as hearing impairment, is a partial or total inability to hear.A deaf person has little to no hearing.   Hearing loss may occur in one or both ears.   In children hearing problems can affect the ability to learn spoken language and in adults it can cause work related difficulties.In some people, particularly older people, hearing loss can result in loneliness.   Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent.  Hearing loss may be caused by a number of factors, including: genetics, ageing, exposure to noise, some infections, birth complications, trauma to the ear, and certain medications or toxins. 

Jargon<====>49607<====>Jargon Jargon is a type of language that is used in a particular context and may not be well understood outside that context.  The context is usually a particular occupation (that is, a certain trade, profession, or academic field), but any ingroup; or social group to which a person psychologically identifies as being a member, can have jargon.  The main trait that distinguishes jargon from the rest of a language is special vocabulary—including some words specific to it, and often different senses or meanings of words, that outgroups would tend to take in another sense; —therefore misunderstanding that communication attempt.

English grammar<====>49610<====>English grammar English grammar is the way in which meanings are encoded into wordings in the English language.  This includes the structure of words, phrases, clauses, and sentences, right up to the structure of whole texts. There are historical, social, cultural and regional variations of English.  Divergences from the grammar described here occur in some dialects of English.  This article describes a generalized present-day Standard English, the form of speech and writing found in types of public discourse including broadcasting, education, entertainment, government, and news  including both formal and informal speech.  There are differences in grammar between the standard forms of British, American, and Australian English, although these are minor compared with the differences in vocabulary and pronunciation.

Universal Disk Format<====>49627<====>Universal Disk Format  Universal Disk Format (UDF) is a profile of the specification known as ISO/IEC 13346 and ECMA-167  and is an open vendor-neutral file system for computer data storage for a broad range of media.  In practice, it has been most widely used for DVDs and newer optical disc formats, supplanting ISO 9660.  Due to its design, it is very well suited to incremental updates on both recordable and (re)writable optical media.  UDF is developed and maintained by the Optical Storage Technology Association (OSTA). Normally, authoring software will master a UDF file system in a batch process and write it to optical media in a single pass.

SEX (computing)<====>49635<====>SEX (computing)In computing, the SEX assembly language mnemonic has often been used for the " Sign EXtend " machine instruction found in the Motorola 6809.  A computer's or CPU's "sex" can also mean the endianness of the computer architecture used.   x86 computers do not have the same "byte sex",  as HC11 computers, for example.  Functions are sometimes needed  for computers of different endianness to communicate with each other over the internet,  as protocols often use big endian byte coding by default. On the RCA 1802 series of microprocessors, the SEX, for " SEt X ," instruction is used to designate which of the machine's sixteen 16-bit registers is to be the X (index) register.

Aurora<====>49658<====>Aurora   An aurora (plural: auroras),  sometimes referred to as polar lights, northern lights (aurora borealis) or southern lights (aurora australis), is a natural light display in the Earth's sky, predominantly seen in the high latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic). Auroras are produced when the magnetosphere is sufficiently disturbed by the solar wind that the trajectories of charged particles in both solar wind and magnetospheric plasma, mainly in the form of electrons and protons, precipitate them into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere) due to Earth's magnetic field, where their energy is lost. The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emits light of varying color and complexity.

He played an important role in the dynastic struggle between rival factions of the Plantagenets known as the Wars of the Roses. Though a member of the House of York, he switched sides to support the Lancastrians, before reverting to the Yorkists.  He was later convicted of treason against his brother, Edward IV, and was executed (allegedly by being drowned in a butt of Malmsey wine).

Antenna gain<====>49693<====>Antenna gain In electromagnetics, an antenna's power gain or simply gain is a key performance number which combines the antenna's directivity and electrical efficiency.   In a transmitting antenna, the gain describes how well the antenna converts input power into radio waves headed in a specified direction.  In a receiving antenna, the gain describes how well the antenna converts radio waves arriving from a specified direction into electrical power.  When no direction is specified, "gain" is understood to refer to the peak value of the gain, the gain in the direction of the antenna's main lobe.   A plot of the gain as a function of direction is called the radiation pattern.

Metropolis (1927 film)<====>49696<====>Metropolis (1927 film)  Metropolis is a 1927 German expressionist epic science-fiction drama film directed by Fritz Lang.  Scripted by Thea von Harbou, with collaboration from Lang himself,   it starred Gustav Fröhlich, Brigitte Helm, Alfred Abel and Rudolf Klein-Rogge.  Erich Pommer produced it in the Babelsberg Studios for Universum Film A. G.  The silent film is regarded as a pioneering work of the science-fiction genre in movies, being among the first feature-length movies of the genre.  Made in Germany during the Weimar Period, Metropolis is set in a futuristic urban dystopia and follows the attempts of Freder, the wealthy son of the city's ruler, and Maria, a poor worker, to overcome the vast gulf separating the classes of their city. 

Sussex<====>49699<====>SussexSussex ( ), from the Old English Sūþsēaxe (South Saxons), is a historic county in South East England corresponding roughly in area to the ancient Kingdom of Sussex.   It is bounded to the west by Hampshire, north by Surrey, northeast by Kent, south by the English Channel, and divided for many purposes into the ceremonial counties of West Sussex and East Sussex.  Brighton and Hove, though part of East Sussex, was made a unitary authority in 1997, and as such, is administered independently of the rest of East Sussex.  Brighton and Hove was granted City status in 2000. 

Kingdom of Sussex<====>49702<====>Kingdom of Sussex    The kingdom of the South Saxons ( ;  ), today referred to as the Kingdom of Sussex, was one of the seven traditional kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy.   On the south coast of England, it was originally a sixth century Saxon colony and later an independent kingdom.  The South Saxons were ruled by the kings of Sussex until the country was annexed by Wessex, probably in 827, in the aftermath of the Battle of Ellandun. Geography The Kingdom of Sussex had its initial focus in a territory based on the former kingdom and Romano-British civitas of the Regnenses  and its boundaries coincided in general with those of the later county of Sussex.

Programmable read-only memory<====>49716<====>Programmable read-only memory A programmable read-only memory (PROM) or field programmable read-only memory (FPROM) or one-time programmable non-volatile memory (OTP NVM) is a form of digital memory where the setting of each bit is locked by a fuse or antifuse.   It is one type of ROM (read-only memory).  The data in them is permanent and cannot be changed.    PROMs are used in digital electronic devices to store permanent data, usually low level programs such as firmware (microcode).   The key difference from a standard ROM  is that the data is written into a ROM during manufacture, while with a PROM the data is programmed into them after manufacture. 

Poynting vector<====>49718<====>Poynting vector In physics, the Poynting vector represents the directional energy flux (the energy transfer per unit area per unit time) of an electromagnetic field.  The SI unit of the Poynting vector is the watt per square metre (W/m 2 ).  It is named after its discoverer John Henry Poynting who first derived it in 1884.DefinitionIn Poynting's original paper and in many textbooks, the Poynting vector is defined as \mathbf{S} = \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}, where bold letters represent vectors andE is the electric field vector;H is the magnetic field's auxiliary field vector.

The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors: Marimelena, Guanabacoa and Atarés. 

Robert Hooke<====>49720<====>Robert Hooke    Robert Hooke FRS ( ;   – 3 March 1703) was an English natural philosopher, architect and polymath. His adult life comprised three distinct periods: as a scientific inquirer lacking money; achieving great wealth and standing through his reputation for hard work and scrupulous honesty following the great fire of 1666, and eventually becoming ill and party to jealous intellectual disputes (the latter may have contributed to his relative historical obscurity). At one time he was simultaneously the curator of experiments of the Royal Society, a member of its council, Gresham Professor of Geometry, and Surveyor to the City of London after the Great Fire of London (in which capacity he appears to have performed more than half of all the surveys after the fire). 

Core dump<====>49721<====>Core dumpIn computing, a core dump, memory dump, or system dump   consists of the recorded state of the working memory of a computer program at a specific time, generally when the program has crashed or otherwise terminated abnormally.    In practice, other key pieces of program state are usually dumped at the same time, including the processor registers, which may include the program counter and stack pointer, memory management information, and other processor and operating system flags and information.  Core dumps are often used to assist in diagnosing and debugging errors in computer programs. The name comes from magnetic core memory,  the principal form of random access memory from the 1950s to the 1970s. 

Reserved word<====>49723<====>Reserved wordIn a computer language, a reserved word (also known as a reserved identifier) is a word that cannot be used as an identifier, such as the name of a variable, function, or label – it is "reserved from use".  This is a syntactic definition, and a reserved word may have no meaning. A closely related and often conflated notion is a keyword, which is a word with special meaning in a particular context.  This is a semantic definition.  By contrast, names in a standard library but not built into the language are not considered reserved words or keywords. 

American bison<====>49725<====>American bison  The American bison (Bison bison), also commonly known as the American buffalo or simply buffalo, is a North American species of bison that once roamed the grasslands of North America in massive herds.   They became nearly extinct by a combination of commercial hunting and slaughter in the 19th century and introduction of bovine diseases from domestic cattle, and have made a recent resurgence largely restricted to a few national parks and reserves.   Their historical range roughly comprised a triangle between the Great Bear Lake in Canada's far northwest, south to the Mexican states of Durango and Nuevo León, and east to the Atlantic Seaboard of the United States (nearly to the Atlantic tidewater in some areas) from New York to Georgia and per some sources down to Florida. 

Alternating group<====>49726<====>Alternating group  In mathematics, an alternating group is the group of even permutations of a finite set.  The alternating group on a set of n elements is called the alternating group of degree n, or the alternating group on n letters and denoted by A n  or Alt(n). Basic propertiesFor  , the group A n  is the commutator subgroup of the symmetric group S n  with index 2 and has therefore n! / 2 elements.  It is the kernel of the signature group homomorphism   explained under symmetric group. The group A n  is abelian if and only if   and simple if and only if   or  . 

Parity of a permutation<====>49727<====>Parity of a permutationIn mathematics, when X is a finite set of at least two elements, the permutations of X (i. e.  the bijective functions from X to X) fall into two classes of equal size: the even permutations and the odd permutations.  If any total ordering of X is fixed, the parity (oddness or evenness) of a permutation  \sigma  of X can be defined as the parity of the number of inversions for σ, i. e. , of pairs of elements   of X such that  x  and  \sigma(x)>\sigma(y) . The sign or signature  of a permutation σ is denoted sgn(σ) and defined as +1 if σ is even and −1 if σ is odd.

Australia Group<====>49732<====>Australia GroupThe Australia Group is a multilateral export control regime (MECR) and an informal group of countries (now joined by the European Commission) established in 1985 (after the use of chemical weapons by Iraq in 1984) to help member countries to identify those exports which need to be controlled so as not to contribute to the spread of chemical and biological weapons.  The group, initially consisting of 15 members, held its first meeting in Brussels, Belgium, in September 1989.

Reading education in the United States<====>49783<====>Reading education in the United States   Reading education is the process by which individuals are taught to derive meaning from text. Government-funded research on reading and reading instruction in the United States began in the 1960s.  In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers began publishing findings based on converging evidence from multiple studies.  However, these findings have been slow to move into typical classroom practice. Competencies for proficient readingProficient reading is equally dependent on two critical skills: the ability to understand the language in which the text is written, and the ability to recognize and process printed text.

Microclimate<====>49786<====>Microclimate  A microclimate is a local set of atmospheric conditions that differ from those in the surrounding areas, often with a slight difference but sometimes with a substantial one.  The term may refer to areas as small as a few square meters or square feet (for example a garden bed or a cave) or as large as many square kilometers or square miles.  Because climate is statistical, which implies spatial and temporal variation of the mean values of the describing parameters, within a region there can occur and persist over time sets of statistically distinct conditions, that is, microclimates.

IBM PC compatible<====>49803<====>IBM PC compatible  IBM PC compatible computers are computers similar to the original IBM PC, XT, and AT, able to run the same software and support the same expansion cards as those.  Such computers used to be referred to as PC clones, or IBM clones.  They duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the PC architecture, facilitated by IBM's choice of commodity hardware components and various manufacturers' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a "clean room design" technique.  Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer by a clean room implementation of its BIOS.

Measures of national income and output<====>49808<====>Measures of national income and outputA variety of measures of national income and output are used in economics to estimate total economic activity in a country or region, including gross domestic product (GDP), gross national product (GNP), net national income (NNI), and adjusted national income (NNI* adjusted for natural resource depletion).  All are specially concerned with counting the total amount of goods and services produced within some the economy and by different sectors.  The boundary is usually defined by geography or citizenship, and may also restrict the goods and services that are counted.  For instance, some measures count only goods & services that are exchanged for money, excluding bartered goods, while other measures may attempt to include bartered goods by imputing monetary values to them.

Multivariate random variable<====>49821<====>Multivariate random variable In probability, and statistics, a multivariate random variable or random vector is a list of mathematical variables each of whose value is unknown, either because the value has not yet occurred or because there is imperfect knowledge of its value.   The individual variables in a random vector are grouped together because they are all part of a single mathematical system — often they represent different properties of an individual statistical unit.  For example, while a given person has a specific age, height and weight, the representation of these features of an unspecified person from within a group would be a random vector. 

Creole language<====>49823<====>Creole language   A creole language,    or simply creole, is a stable natural language developed from a mixture of different languages at a fairly sudden point in time: often, a pidgin transitioned into a full, native language.  While the concept is similar to that of a mixed or hybrid language, in the strict sense of the term, a mixed/hybrid language has derived from two or more languages, to such an extent that it is no longer closely related to the source languages.  Creoles also differ from pidgins in that, while a pidgin has a highly simplified linguistic structure that develops as a means of establishing communication between two or more disparate language groups, a creole language is more complex, used for day-to-day purposes in a community, and acquired by children as a native language. 

Grand Canal (China)<====>49824<====>Grand Canal (China)  The Grand Canal (also known as the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal), a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the longest canal or artificial river in the world and a famous tourist destination.

Owing to the outbreak of the Thirty Years War his studies at Leipzig were disrupted and subsequently he studied at the Academia Julia in Helmstedt and the universities of Jena and Leyden. 

Material dispersion coefficient<====>49829<====>Material dispersion coefficientIn an optical fiber, the material dispersion coefficient, M(λ), characterizes the amount of pulse broadening by material dispersion per unit length of fiber and per unit of spectral width.  It is usually expressed in picoseconds per (nanometre·kilometre).  For many optical fiber materials, M(λ) approaches zero at a specific wavelength λ 0  between 1. 3  and 1. 5 μm.  At wavelengths shorter than λ 0 , M(λ) is negative and increases with wavelength; at wavelengths longer than λ 0 , M(λ) is positive and decreases with wavelength.  Pulse broadening caused by material dispersion in a unit length of optical fiber is given by the product of M(λ) and spectral width (Δλ). 

Light pen<====>49831<====>Light pen A light pen is a computer input device in the form of a light-sensitive wand used in conjunction with a computer's CRT display. It allows the user to point to displayed objects or draw on the screen in a similar way to a touchscreen but with greater positional accuracy.   A light pen can work with any CRT-based display, but its ability to be used with LCDs was unclear (though Toshiba and Hitachi displayed a similar idea at the "Display 2006" show in Japan ). A light pen detects a change of brightness of nearby screen pixels when scanned by cathode ray tube electron beam and communicates the timing of this event to the computer. 

N-ary code<====>49836<====>N-ary codeDISPLAYTITLEIn telecommunication, a n-ary code is a code that has n significant conditions, where n is a positive integer greater than 1.   The integer substituted for n indicates the specific number of significant conditions, i.e., quantization states, in the code. For example, an 8-ary code has eight significant conditions and can convey three bits per code symbol. A prefix that indicates an integer, e.g., "bin", "tern," or "quatern", may be used in lieu of a numeral, to produce "binary", "ternary", or "quaternary" (2, 3, and 4 states respectively).See alsoAritySource: from Federal Standard 1037C and from MIL-STD-188

RealMedia<====>49839<====>RealMedia  RealMedia is a proprietary multimedia container format created by RealNetworks.  Its extension is ". rm".  It is typically used in conjunction with RealVideo and RealAudio and is used for streaming content over the Internet.  Typically these streams are in CBR (constant bitrate), but a container for VBR (variable bitrate) streams, named RMVB (RealMedia variable bitrate), has been developed.  Support of RealMedia is available in a few multimedia players for different architectures/platforms , including RealPlayer and the Real Alternative codec pack.  The open source DAP firmware Rockbox has added support for reading RM containers as of 6 July 2009, although only certain formats used in RM files are playable. 

Keyboard instrument<====>49842<====>Keyboard instrument A keyboard instrument is a musical instrument played using a keyboard, a row of levers which are pressed by the fingers.  The most common of these are the piano, organ, and various electronic keyboards, including synthesizers and digital pianos.  Other keyboard instruments include  celestas, which are struck idiophones operated by a keyboard, and carillons, which are usually housed in bell towers or belfries of churches or municipal buildings.    Today, the term keyboard often refers to keyboard-style synthesizers.  Under the fingers of a sensitive performer, the keyboard may also be used to control dynamics, phrasing, shading, articulation, and other elements of expression—depending on the design and inherent capabilities of the instrument. 

Local exchange carrier<====>49852<====>Local exchange carrier Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) is a regulatory term in telecommunications for the local telephone company. In the United States, wireline telephone companies are divided into two large categories: long distance (interexchange carrier, or IXCs) and local (local exchange carrier, or LECs).  This structure is a result of 1984 divestiture of then-regulated monopoly carrier American Telephone & Telegraph.  Local telephone companies at the time of the divestiture are also known as Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (ILEC). The divestiture created local exchange carriers for the management of local telephone lines and switches, and provisioning of local phone services within their business area, as well as the long distance calls originating or terminating in their business area.

Umayyad Caliphate<====>49855<====>Umayyad Caliphate The Umayyad Caliphate ( , trans.  Al-Khilāfatu al-ʾUmawiyyah), also spelt  ,  was the second of the four major caliphates established after the death of Muhammad.  The caliphate was ruled by the Umayyad dynasty ( , al-ʾUmawiyyūn, or  , Banū ʾUmayya, "Sons of Umayya"), hailing from Mecca.  An Umayyad clan member had previously come to power as the third Rashidun Caliph, Uthman ibn Affan (r.  644–656), but official Umayyad rule was established by Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan, long-time governor of Syria, after the end of the First Muslim Civil War in AD 661. 

Abbasid Caliphate<====>49856<====>Abbasid Caliphate   The Abbasid Caliphate (  or ) was the third of the Islamic caliphates to succeed the Islamic prophet Muhammad.  The Abbasid dynasty descended from Muhammad's uncle, Al-Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib (566–653 CE), from whom the dynasty takes its name.   They ruled as caliphs for most of their period from their capital in Baghdad in modern-day Iraq, after assuming authority over the Muslim empire from the Umayyads in 750 CE (132 AH). The Abbasid caliphate first centred its government in Kufa, but in 762 the caliph Al-Mansur founded the city of Baghdad, near the Sasanian capital city of Ctesiphon. 

Fauna of Australia<====>49860<====>Fauna of Australia    The fauna of Australia consists of a huge variety of animals; some 83% of mammals, 89% of reptiles, 24% of fish and insects and 93% of amphibians that inhabit the continent are endemic to Australia.  Williams, J.  et al.  2001.  Biodiversity, Australia State of the Environment Report 2001 (Theme Report), CSIRO Publishing on behalf of the Department of the Environment and Heritage, Canberra.This high level of endemism can be attributed to the continent's long geographic isolation, tectonic stability, and the effects of an unusual pattern of climate change on the soil and flora over geological time. 

Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)<====>49861<====>Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)   Alexandra Feodorovna (6 June 1872 – 17 July 1918) was Empress of Russia as the spouse of Nicholas II, the last ruler of the Russian Empire.  Originally Alix of Hesse and by Rhine at birth, she was given the Christian name and patronymic Alexandra Feodorovna upon being received into the Russian Orthodox Church and—having been put to death along with her immediate family while in Bolshevik captivity in 1918—was canonized in 2000 as Saint Alexandra the Passion Bearer. A granddaughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, Alexandra was one of the most famous royal carriers of the haemophilia disease. 

Laputa<====>49863<====>LaputaLaputa is a flying island described in the 1726 book Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift.  It is about 4. 5 miles in diameter, with an adamantine base, which its inhabitants can maneuver in any direction using magnetic levitation.  It has a cave in the very centre which is precisely there to gather all the rainwater.  It is also used by the king to enforce his supremacy. LocationLaputa was located above the realm of Balnibarbi, which was ruled by its king from the flying island.   Gulliver states the island flew by the “magnetick virtue” of  certain minerals in the ground of Balnibarbi which did not extend more than four miles above, and six leagues beyond the extent of the kingdom , showing the limit of its range. 

Abbadid dynasty<====>49865<====>Abbadid dynasty For the Baghdad dynasty, see Abbasid Caliphate. The Abbadies dynasty or Abbadies (Arabic,بنو عباد) was an Arab Muslim dynasty which arose in Al-Andalus on the downfall of the Caliphate of Cordoba (756–1031).  After the collapse, there were multiple small Muslim "Caliphates": the Hammudids, the Zayrids, the Jahwarids, the Dhul-Nunids, the Amirids, the Tojibids, and the Hudids.  Of all of these small groups, the Abbadies were the strongest and before long absorbed most of the others.   Abbadies rule lasted from about 1023 until 1091,   but during the short period of its existence it exhibited singular energy and typified its time. 

Almohad Caliphate<====>49867<====>Almohad Caliphate  The Almohad Caliphate (British English:  , U. S.  English:  ;   (Imweḥḥden), from Arabic   ( ), "the monotheists" or "the unifiers") was a Moroccan   Berber Muslim movement founded in the 12th century.    The Almohad movement was founded by Ibn Tumart among the Berber Masmuda tribes of southern Morocco.  Around 1120, the Almohads first established a Berber state in Tinmel in the Atlas Mountains.   They succeeded in overthrowing the ruling Almoravid dynasty governing Morocco by 1147, when Abd al-Mu'min al-Gumi (r.  1130–1163) conquered Marrakesh and declared himself Caliph. 

Eucalyptus<====>49871<====>Eucalyptus  Eucalyptus    L'Héritier 1789  is a diverse genus of flowering trees and shrubs (including a distinct group with a multiple-stem mallee growth habit) in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.  Members of the genus dominate the tree flora of Australia, and include Eucalyptus regnans, the tallest known flowering plant on Earth.There are more than 700 species of eucalyptus and most are native to Australia; a very small number are found in adjacent areas of New Guinea and Indonesia.  One species, Eucalyptus deglupta, ranges as far north as the Philippines.  Of the 15 species found outside Australia, just nine are exclusively non-Australian. 

Areca nut<====>49877<====>Areca nut  The areca nut (  or  ) is the fruit of the areca palm (Areca catechu), which grows in much of the tropical Pacific (Melanesia and Micronesia), Southeast and South Asia, and parts of east Africa.  This fruit is commonly referred to as betel nut so it is easily confused with betel (Piper betle) leaves that are often used to wrap it (paan).   The term areca originated from the Malayalam word adakka (അടക്ക)   Additional information: Cognates include Kannada adike/ಅಡಿಕೆ, Malayalam adakka/ataykka, and Tamil adakkai.   and dates from the 16th century, when Dutch and Portuguese sailors took the nut from Kerala to Europe. 

Standard enthalpy of formation<====>49887<====>Standard enthalpy of formationThe standard enthalpy of formation or standard heat of formation of a compound is the change of enthalpy during the formation of 1 mole of the substance from its constituent elements, with all substances in their standard states.  The standard pressure value p  o   = 10 5  Pa (= 100 kPa = 1 bar) is recommended by IUPAC, although prior to 1982 the value 1. 00 atm (101. 325 kPa) was used.   There is no standard temperature.  Its symbol is Δ f H ⊖ .  The superscript Plimsoll on this symbol indicates that the process has occurred under standard conditions at the specified temperature (usually 25 °C or 298. 

Herring<====>49890<====>Herring  Herring are forage fish, mostly belonging to the family Clupeidae. Herring often move in large schools around fishing banks and near the coast.  The most abundant and commercially important species belong to the genus Clupea, found particularly in shallow, temperate waters of the North Pacific and the North Atlantic Oceans, including the Baltic Sea, as well as off the west coast of South America.  Three species of Clupea are recognised, and provide about 90% of all herrings captured in fisheries.  Most abundant of all is the Atlantic herring, providing over half of all herring capture. 

Socratic method<====>49892<====>Socratic method  The Socratic method, also can be known as maieutics, method of elenchus, elenctic method, or Socratic debate, is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presumptions.  It is a dialectical method, involving a discussion in which the defense of one point of view is questioned; one participant may lead another to contradict themselves in some way, thus weakening the defender's point.  This method is named after the Classical Greek philosopher Socrates and is introduced by him in Plato's Theaetetus as midwifery ( ) because it is employed to bring out definitions implicit in the interlocutors' beliefs, or to help them further their understanding. 

Kenneth Arrow<====>49894<====>Kenneth Arrow  Kenneth Joseph "Ken" Arrow (23 August 1921 – 21 February 2017) was an American economist, mathematician, writer, and political theorist.  He was the joint winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with John Hicks in 1972. In economics, he was a figure in post-World War II neo-classical economic theory.  Many of his former graduate students have gone on to win the Nobel Memorial Prize themselves.  His most significant works are his contributions to social choice theory, notably "Arrow's impossibility theorem", and his work on general equilibrium analysis.  He has also provided foundational work in many other areas of economics, including endogenous growth theory and the economics of information. 

Piety<====>49895<====>PietyIn spiritual terminology, piety is a virtue that may include religious devotion, spirituality, or a mixture of both.  A common element in most conceptions of piety is humility and religiosity.  EtymologyThe word piety comes from the Latin word pietas, the noun form of the adjective pius (which means "devout" or "dutiful").  Pietas in traditional Latin usage expressed a complex, highly valued Roman virtue; a man with pietas respected his responsibilities to gods, country, parents, and kin.   In its strictest sense it was the sort of love a son ought to have for his father. UsePiety in modern English usage can refer to a way to win the favour or forgiveness of God. 

Courage<====>49899<====>Courage   Courage (also called bravery or valour) is the choice and willingness to confront agony, pain, danger, uncertainty, or intimidation.  Physical courage is bravery in the face of physical pain, hardship, death or threat of death, while moral courage is the ability to act rightly in the face of popular opposition, shame, scandal, discouragement, or personal loss. The classical virtue of fortitude (andreia, fortitudo) is also translated "courage", but includes the aspects of perseverance and patience.    In the Western tradition, notable thoughts on courage have come from philosophers, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, and Kierkegaard; in the Eastern tradition, some thoughts on courage were offered by the Tao Te Ching. 

Virtue<====>49901<====>Virtue   Virtue ( ,   "arete") is moral excellence.  A virtue is a trait or quality that is deemed to be morally good and thus is valued as a foundation of principle and good moral being.  Personal virtues are characteristics valued as promoting collective and individual greatness.  The opposite of virtue is vice. The four classic cardinal virtues are temperance, prudence, courage, and justice.  Christianity derives the three theological virtues of faith, hope and love (charity) from 1 Corinthians.  Together these make up the seven virtues.  Buddhism's four brahmavihara ("Divine States") can be regarded as virtues in the European sense. 

Pope Leo XII<====>49902<====>Pope Leo XII  Pope Leo XII (22 August 1760 – 10 February 1829), born Annibale Francesco Clemente Melchiorre Girolamo Nicola Sermattei della Genga,    was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 28 September 1823 to his death in 1829. Leo XII was in ill health from the time of his election to the papacy to his death less than 6 years later, although he was noted for enduring pain well.  He was a deeply conservative ruler, who enforced many controversial laws, including one forbidding Jews to own property.  Papal finances were also poor, even though he reduced taxes. 

Scoti<====>49904<====>Scoti  Scoti or Scotti is a Latin name for the Gaels, Duffy, Seán.  Medieval Ireland: An Encyclopedia.  Routledge, 2005.  p. 698  first attested in the late 3rd century.

Anarcho-syndicalism<====>49938<====>Anarcho-syndicalismAnarcho-syndicalism (also referred to as revolutionary syndicalism)  is a theory of anarchism that views revolutionary industrial unionism or syndicalism as a method for workers in capitalist society to gain control of an economy and, with that control, influence broader society.  Syndicalists consider their economic theories a strategy for facilitating worker self-activity and as an alternative co-operative economic system with democratic values and production centered on meeting human needs. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are solidarity, direct action (action undertaken without the intervention of third parties such as politicians, bureaucrats, and arbitrators) and direct democracy, or workers' self-management. 

Aaron's rod<====>49940<====>Aaron's rod Aaron's rod refers to any of the staff carried by Moses's brother, Aaron, in the Torah.   The Bible tells how, along with Moses's rod, Aaron's rod was endowed with miraculous power during the Plagues of Egypt that preceded the Exodus.   There are two occasions where the Bible tells of the rod's power. Biblical referencesIn the culture of the Israelites, the rod (  maṭṭeh) was a natural symbol of authority, as the tool used by the shepherd to correct and guide his flock (Psalm 23:4).  Moses's rod is, in fact, cited in Exodus 4:2 as carried by him while he tended his sheep; and later (Exodus 4:20) becomes his symbol of authority over the Israelites (Psalm 2:9, Psalm 89:32, Isaiah 10:24 and 11:4, Ezekiel 20:37).

Rainforest<====>50047<====>Rainforest   Rainforests are forests characterized by high rainfall, with annual rainfall in the case of tropical rainforests between  ,  and definitions varying by region for temperate rainforests.  The monsoon trough, alternatively known as the intertropical convergence zone, plays a significant role in creating the climatic conditions necessary for the Earth's tropical rainforests. Around 40% to 75% of all biotic species are indigenous to the rainforests.There may be many millions of species of plants, insects and microorganisms  still undiscovered in tropical rainforests.  Tropical rainforests have been called the "jewels of the Earth" and the "world's largest pharmacy", because over one quarter of natural medicines have been discovered there.

A polar climate results in treeless tundra, glaciers, or a permanent or semi-permanent layer of ice.  It has cool summers and very cold winters. Subtypes There are two types of polar climate: ET, or tundra climate; and EF, or ice cap climate. 

Subarctic climate<====>50049<====>Subarctic climateThe subarctic climate (also called subpolar climate, subalpine climate, or boreal climate) is a climate characterised by long, usually very cold winters, and short, cool to mild summers.  It is found on large landmasses, away from the moderating effects of an ocean, generally at latitudes from 50° to 70°N poleward of the humid continental climates.  These climates represent Köppen climate classification Dfc, Dwc, Dsc, Dfd, Dwd and  Dsd.  In very small areas at high altitudes around the Mediterranean Basin, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Alaska and other parts of the northwestern United States (Eastern Washington, Eastern Oregon and Idaho) the climate is classified as Dsc with a dry summer climate, such as in Seneca, Oregon.

Leading the Lancastrian army was Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, who played a crucial role in the fate of each king. 

Chemical warfare<====>50073<====>Chemical warfare    Chemical warfare (CW) involves using the toxic properties of chemical substances as weapons.  This type of warfare is distinct from nuclear warfare and biological warfare, which together make up NBC, the military acronym for nuclear, biological, and chemical (warfare or weapons), all of which are considered "weapons of mass destruction" (WMDs).  None of these fall under the term conventional weapons which are primarily effective due to their destructive potential.  With proper protective equipment, training, and decontamination measures, the primary effects of chemical weapons can be overcome.  Many nations possess vast stockpiles of weaponized agents in preparation for wartime use. 

String instrument<====>50076<====>String instrument  String instruments, stringed instruments, or chordophones are musical instruments that produce sound from vibrating strings when the performer plays or sounds the strings in some manner.  Musicians play some string instruments by plucking the strings with their fingers or a plectrum—and others by hitting the strings with a light wooden hammer or  by rubbing the strings with a bow.  In some keyboard instruments, such as the harpsichord , the musician presses a key that plucks the string. With bowed instruments, the player rubs the strings with a horsehair bow, causing them to vibrate.  With a hurdy-gurdy, the musician operates a mechanical wheel that rubs the strings. 

Pulitzer Prize for History<====>50079<====>Pulitzer Prize for History The Pulitzer Prize for History, administered by Columbia University, is one of the seven American Pulitzer Prizes that are annually awarded for Letters, Drama, and Music.  It has been presented since 1917 for a distinguished book about the history of the United States.  Thus it is one of the original Pulitzers, for the program was inaugurated in 1917 with seven prizes, four of which were awarded that year.   The Pulitzer Prize program has also recognized some historical work with its Biography prize, from 1917, and its General Non-Fiction prize, from 1952. Finalists have been announced from 1980, ordinarily two others beside the winner. 

Pulitzer Prize for Criticism<====>50080<====>Pulitzer Prize for Criticism  The Pulitzer Prize for Criticism has been presented since 1970 to a newspaper writer who has demonstrated 'distinguished criticism'.   Recipients of the award are chosen by an independent board and officially administered by Columbia University.   The Pulitzer Committee issues an official citation explaining the reasons for the award. Winners and citationsThe Criticism Pulitzer has been awarded to one person annually except in 1992 when it was not awarded—43 prizes in 44 years 1970–2013.  No person has won it twice.  1970: Ada Louise Huxtable, The New York Times, "for distinguished criticism during 1969"1971: Harold C. 

Jaxon modulation<====>50081<====>Jaxon modulation Jaxon modulation is a modulation system for placing information on a bitstream generated by a finite generator. A bitstream of random nature can most probably not have any extra information modulated onto it.  While a bitstream with zero entropy can have any amount of information modulated onto it.  But such a stream which holds the modulated information can not be made by a   generator.  In between these two grounds of maximal entropy and minimal entropy perhaps a finite generator exists for a stream having a ratio of 4 to 1 in the bit states. 

Bitstream<====>50082<====>Bitstream  A bitstream (or bit stream), also known as binary sequence, is a sequence of bits. A bytestream is a sequence of bytes.   Typically, each byte is a 8-bit quantity (octets), and so the term octet stream is sometimes used interchangeably.  An octet may be encoded as a sequence of 8 bits in multiple different ways (see endianness) so there is no unique and direct translation between bytestreams and bitstreams. Bitstreams  and bytestreams are used extensively in telecommunications and computing.  For example, synchronous bitstreams are carried by SONET, and Transmission Control Protocol transports an asynchronous bytestream. 

Otto Neurath<====>50089<====>Otto Neurath Otto Neurath ( ; December 10, 1882 – December 22, 1945) was an Austrian philosopher, philosopher of science, sociologist, and political economist.  Before he fled his native country in 1934, Neurath was one of the leading figures of the Vienna Circle. BiographyNeurath was born in Vienna, the son of Wilhelm Neurath (1840–1901), a well-known political economist at the time.  Helene Migerka was his cousin.He studied mathematics in Vienna and gained his Ph. D.  in the department of Political Science and Statistics at the University of Berlin. He married Anna Schapire in 1907, who died in 1911 while bearing their son Paul. 

408 BC<====>50091<====>408 BC    Year 408 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time, it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Iullus, Ahala and Cossus (or, less frequently, year 346 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 408 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placePersian EmpireKing Darius II of Persia decides to continue the war against Athens and give support to the Spartans.  His wife, Parysatis, persuades him to appoint his younger son, Cyrus, as satrap (governor) of Lydia, Phrygia, and Cappadocia and commander in chief of the Achaemenian forces in Asia Minor in place of Tissaphernes. 

Kate Chopin<====>50099<====>Kate Chopin Kate Chopin, born Katherine O'Flaherty (February 8, 1850 – August 22, 1904), was an American author of short stories and novels based in Louisiana.  She is now considered by some scholars   to have been a forerunner of American 20th-century feminist authors of Southern or Catholic background, such as Zelda Fitzgerald. Of maternal French and paternal Irish descent, Chopin was born in St.  Louis, Missouri.  She married and moved with her husband to New Orleans.  They later lived in the country in Cloutierville, Louisiana.  From 1892 to 1895, Chopin wrote short stories for both children and adults that were published in such national magazines as Atlantic Monthly, Vogue, The Century Magazine, and The Youth's Companion. 

Journalist<====>50100<====>Journalist   A journalist is a person who collects, writes, or distributes news or other current information to the public.  A journalist's work is called journalism.  A journalist can work with general issues or specialize in certain issues.  However, most journalists tend to specialize, and by cooperating with other journalists, produce journals that span many topics.   For example, a sports journalist covers news within the world of sports, but this journalist may be a part of a newspaper that covers many different topics. RolesA reporter is a type of journalist who researches, writes, and reports on information in order to present in sources, conduct interviews, engage in research, and make reports. 

Zebu<====>50111<====>Zebu  A zebu ( ,   or  ; Bos primigenius indicus or Bos indicus or Bos taurus indicus), sometimes known as indicine cattle or humped cattle, is a species or subspecies of domestic cattle originating in South Asia.  Zebu are characterised by a fatty hump on their shoulders, a large dewlap, and sometimes drooping ears.  They are well adapted to withstanding high temperatures, and are farmed throughout the tropical countries, both as pure zebu and as hybrids with taurine cattle, the other main type of domestic cattle.  Zebu are used as draught oxen,  dairy cattle, and  beef cattle, as well as for byproducts such as hides and dung for fuel and manure. 

Lille<====>50116<====>Lille   Lille ( ;    ;  ) is a city at the northern tip of France, in French Flanders.  On the Deûle River, near France's border with Belgium, it is the capital of the Hauts-de-France region and the prefecture of the Nord department. As of 2009, Lille had a population of 226,827 within its administrative limits,    and an urban population of 1,015,744, making it the fifth largest urban area in France after Paris, Lyon, Marseille and Toulouse. History Origin of the cityArcheological digs seem to show the area as inhabited by as early as 2000 BC,  most notably in the modern-day quartiers of Fives, Wazemmes, and Vieux Lille. 

Groningen (province)<====>50117<====>Groningen (province)  {{Infobox settlement }}Groningen ( ; Gronings: Grönnen or Grunn;  ) is the northeasternmost province of the Netherlands.  It borders on Friesland to the west, Drenthe to the south, the German state of Niedersachsen (districts of Leer and Emsland) to the east, and the Wadden Sea to the north.  In 2014, it had a population of 582,640 and a total area of  . The area was subsequently part of Frisia, the Frankish Empire, the Holy Roman Empire, and the Dutch Republic, which is the precursor state of the Netherlands.  In the 14th century, the city of Groningen became a member of the Hanseatic League. 

Groningen<====>50118<====>Groningen  {{Infobox settlement  }}Groningen ( ; Gronings: Grunnen) is the main municipality as well as the capital city of the eponymous province in the Netherlands.  With a population of 202,567  ,  it is the largest city in the north of the Netherlands.  An old city, Groningen was the regional power of the northern Netherlands, a semi-independent city-state and member of the German Hanseatic League.  Groningen is a university city: it houses the University of Groningen (with about 30,000 students) and the Hanze University of Applied Sciences (with about 25,000 students). History   The city was founded on the northernmost point of the Hondsrug area. 

Yuri Andropov<====>50122<====>Yuri Andropov   Yuri Vladimirovich Andropov ( ;   ;   – 9 February 1984)  was a Soviet politician and the fourth General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.  Following the 18-year rule of the late Leonid Brezhnev, Andropov served in the post for only 15 months, from November 1982 until his own death in February 1984.  Earlier in his career, Andropov served as the Soviet ambassador to Hungary from 1954 to 1957, during which time he was involved in the suppression of the 1956 Hungarian Uprising, and then Chairman of the KGB from 1967 until 1982. 

Autocracy<====>50123<====>Autocracy An autocracy is a system of government in which supreme power (social and political) is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of a coup d'état or mass insurrection).   Absolute monarchy (such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Brunei and Swaziland) and dictatorships (such as  North Korea) are the main modern day forms of autocracy. In earlier times, the term "autocrat" was coined as a favorable feature of the ruler, having some connection to the concept of "lack of conflicts of interests" as well as an indication of grandeur and power. 

Cornett<====>50125<====>Cornett   The cornett, cornetto, or zink is an early wind instrument that dates from the Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque periods, popular from 1500 to 1650.   It was used in what are now called alta capellas or wind ensembles.  It is not to be confused with the trumpet-like cornet. The sound of the cornett is produced by lip vibrations against a cup mouthpiece.  A cornett consists of a conical wooden pipe covered in leather, is about   long, and has finger holes and a small horn or ivory mouthpiece. ConstructionThe ordinary treble cornett is made by splitting a length of wood and gouging out the two halves to make the gently conical, curved bore. 

Eleanor Bron<====>50133<====>Eleanor Bron  Eleanor Bron (born 14 March 1938) is an English stage, film and television actress, and an author.  She is best known for her roles as Ahme in Help! and Miss Minchin in A Little Princess (1995). Early life and familyBron was born in 1938 in Stanmore, Middlesex, into a Jewish family.  Before her birth, her father Sidney had legally changed his name from Bronstein to Bron, in an effort to enhance his newly founded commercial enterprise, Bron's Orchestral Service.    She attended the North London Collegiate School and then Newnham College, Cambridge.  She later characterised her time at Newnham as "three years of unparalleled pampering and privilege". 

Third Council of Constantinople<====>50137<====>Third Council of Constantinople    The Third Council of Constantinople, counted as the Sixth Ecumenical Council  by the Orthodox Church, the Catholic Church and other Christian groups, met in 680/681 and condemned monoenergism and monothelitism as heretical and defined Jesus Christ as having two energies and two wills (divine and human).   George Ostrogorsky, History of the Byzantine State (Rutgers University Press, 1995), 127.  Background The Council settled a set of theological controversies that go back to the sixth century but had intensified under the Emperors Heraclius (610–641) and Constans II (641–668).  Heraclius had set out to recover much of the part of his Empire lost to the Persians and had attempted to bridge the controversy with Monophysitism, which was particularly strong in Syria and Egypt, by proposing a moderate theological position that had as good support in the tradition as any other. 

Girolamo Savonarola<====>50139<====>Girolamo Savonarola   Girolamo Savonarola ( ; 21 September 1452 – 23 May 1498) was an Italian Dominican friar and preacher active in Renaissance Florence.  He was known for his prophecies of civic glory, the destruction of secular art and culture, and his calls for Christian renewal.  He denounced clerical corruption, despotic rule and the exploitation of the poor.  He prophesied the coming of a biblical flood and a new Cyrus from the north who would reform the Church.  In September 1494, when Charles VIII of France invaded Italy, and threatened Florence, such prophecies seemed on the verge of fulfilment. 

Economic surplus<====>50145<====>Economic surplus  In mainstream economics, economic surplus, also known as total welfare or Marshallian surplus (named after Alfred Marshall), refers to two related quantities.   Consumer surplus or consumers' surplus is the monetary gain obtained by consumers because they are able to purchase a product for a price that is less than the highest price that they would be willing to pay.   Producer surplus or producers' surplus is the amount that producers benefit by selling at a market price that is higher than the least that they would be willing to sell for; this is roughly equal to profit (since producers are not normally willing to sell at a loss, and are normally indifferent to selling at a breakeven price). 

Prosecutor's fallacy<====>50148<====>Prosecutor's fallacyThe prosecutor's fallacy is a fallacy of statistical reasoning, typically used by the prosecution to argue for the guilt of a defendant during a criminal trial.  Although it is named after prosecutors it is not specific to them, and some variants of the fallacy can be used by defense lawyers arguing for the innocence of their client.   At its heart, the fallacy involves assuming that the prior probability of a random match is equal to the probability that the defendant is innocent.  For instance, if a perpetrator is known to have the same blood type as a defendant and 10% of the population share that blood type, then to argue on that basis alone that the probability of the defendant being guilty is 90% makes the prosecutor's fallacy (in a very simple form). 

Longitude rewards<====>50149<====>Longitude rewards The Longitude rewards refer to the system of inducement prizes offered by the British government as a simple and practical method for the precise determination of a ship's longitude at sea.   The rewards, established through an Act of Parliament (the Longitude Act) in 1714, were administered by the Board of Longitude. This was by no means the first reward to be offered to solve this problem.  Philip II of Spain offered one in 1567, Philip III in 1598 offered 6,000 ducats and a pension,    whilst the States General of the Netherlands offered 10,000 florins shortly after. 

Leonid Brezhnev<====>50151<====>Leonid BrezhnevLeonid Ilyich Brezhnev ( ;   ;  , 19 December 1906  (O. S.  6 December)  – 10 November 1982)  was a Soviet politician who led the Soviet Union from 1964 to 1982 as the General Secretary of the Central Committee (CC) of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), presiding over the country until his death and funeral in 1982.  His eighteen-year term as General Secretary was second only to that of Joseph Stalin in duration.  During Brezhnev's rule, the global influence of the Soviet Union grew dramatically, in part because of the expansion of the Soviet military during this time. 

Battle of Stoke Field<====>50157<====>Battle of Stoke Field  The Battle of Stoke Field on 16 June 1487 may be considered the last battle of the Wars of the Roses, since it was the last major engagement between contenders for the throne whose claims derived from descent from the houses of Lancaster and York respectively.  The Battle of Bosworth Field, two years previously, had established King Henry VII on the throne, ending the last period of Yorkist rule and initiating that of the Tudors.  The Battle of Stoke Field was the decisive engagement in an attempt by leading Yorkists to unseat him in favour of the pretender Lambert Simnel. 

Louis de Broglie<====>50165<====>Louis de Broglie   Louis-Victor-Pierre-Raymond de Broglie ( ;or  ; 15 August 1892 – 19 March 1987) was a French physicist who made groundbreaking contributions to quantum theory.  In his 1924 PhD thesis he postulated the wave nature of electrons and suggested that all matter has wave properties.  This concept is known as the de Broglie hypothesis, an example of wave–particle duality, and forms a central part of the theory of quantum mechanics. De Broglie won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1929, after the wave-like behaviour of matter was first experimentally demonstrated in 1927. 

Jellyfish<====>50185<====>Jellyfish   Jellyfish or  jellies Van Patten, Peg.  "Sting"  .  (2004).  Wrack Lines.  Paper 11.   are softbodied, free-swimming aquatic animals with a gelatinous umbrella-shaped bell and trailing tentacles.  The bell can pulsate to acquire propulsion and locomotion.  The tentacles may be utilized to capture prey or defend against predators by emitting toxins in a painful sting.  Jellyfish species are classified in the subphylum Medusozoa which makes up a major part of the phylum Cnidaria, although not all Medusozoa species are considered to be jellyfish. Jellyfish are found in every ocean, from the surface to the deep sea. 

Mantua<====>50187<====>Mantua  Mantua (   ; Emilian and Latin: Mantua) is a city and comune in Lombardy, Italy, and capital of the province of the same name. In 2016, Mantua became Italian Capital of Culture.  In 2017, Mantua will also be European Capital of Gastronomy, included in the Eastern Lombardy District (together with the cities of Bergamo, Brescia, and Cremona). In 2007, Mantua's centro storico (old town) and Sabbioneta were declared by UNESCO to be a World Heritage Site.  Mantua's historic power and influence under the Gonzaga family has made it one of the main artistic, cultural, and especially musical hubs of Northern Italy and the country as a whole. 

Town drunk<====>50189<====>Town drunkThe town drunk (also called a tavern fool) is a stock character, almost always male, who is drunk more often than sober.   Uses in fictionIn fiction, the town drunk character serves a number of functions.   The town drunk may serve merely as a moral example and object lesson on the evils of drunkenness.  This approach to the character is associated with the "temperance" movement, and peaked at the start of the twentieth century.  The notorious Prohibition play Ten Nights in a Barroom portrays the inevitable fall into destitute drunkenness of a person who dared to take that "Fatal Glass of Beer", the title of another period drama working this vein. 

Pizzicato<====>50190<====>Pizzicato  Pizzicato ( ;    , translated as pinched, and sometimes roughly as plucked) is a playing technique that involves plucking the strings of a string instrument.  The exact technique varies somewhat depending on the type of stringed instrument. On bowed string instruments it is a method of playing by plucking the strings with the fingers, rather than using the bow.  This produces a very different sound from bowing, short and percussive rather than sustained. On a keyboard string instrument, such as the piano, pizzicato may be employed (although rarely seen) as one of the variety of techniques involving direct manipulation of the strings known collectively as "string piano".

William Harvey<====>50203<====>William HarveyWilliam Harvey (1 April 1578 – 3 June 1657) was an English physician who made seminal contributions in anatomy and physiology.  He was the first known physician to describe completely and in detail the systemic circulation and properties of blood being pumped to the brain and body by the heart, though earlier writers, such as Realdo Colombo, Michael Servetus, and Jacques Dubois, had provided precursors of the theory.    In 1973 the William Harvey Hospital was constructed in the town of Ashford, a few miles from his birthplace of Folkestone. FamilyWilliam's father, Thomas Harvey, was a jurat  of Folkestone where he served the office of mayor in 1600. 

Fulgencio Batista<====>50206<====>Fulgencio Batista    Fulgencio Batista y Zaldívar ( ; born Rubén Zaldívar;  January 16, 1901 – August 6, 1973) was the elected President of Cuba from 1940 to 1944, and U. S. -backed dictator from 1952 to 1959, before being overthrown during the Cuban Revolution.  Batista initially rose to power as part of the 1933 Revolt of the Sergeants, which overthrew the provisional government of Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada.  He then appointed himself chief of the armed forces, with the rank of colonel, and effectively controlled the five-member "pentarchy" that functioned as the collective head of state. 

Porvoo<====>50208<====>Porvoo  Porvoo ( ;    ) is a city and a municipality situated on the southern coast of Finland approximately   east of Helsinki.  It is one of the six medieval towns in Finland, first mentioned as a city in texts from 14th century.  Porvoo is the seat of the Swedish-speaking Diocese of Borgå of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland. The municipality's official languages are Finnish and Swedish.  In 2014, 64. 6% of the population spoke Finnish as their mother tongue, while 30. 1% were Swedish speakers.  5. 4% had a different mother tongue. 

Morganatic marriage<====>50213<====>Morganatic marriageIn the context of royalty, a morganatic marriage, sometimes called a left-handed marriage  is a marriage between people of unequal social rank, which prevents the passage of the husband's titles and privileges to the wife and any children born of the marriage. Generally, this is a marriage between a man of high birth (such as from a reigning, deposed or mediatised dynasty) and a woman of lesser status (such as a daughter of a low-ranked noble family or a commoner).

Prime meridian<====>50225<====>Prime meridian   A prime meridian is a meridian (a line of longitude) in a geographical coordinate system at which longitude is defined to be 0°.  Together, a prime meridian and its antimeridian (the 180th meridian in a 360°-system) form a great circle.  This great circle divides the sphere, e. g. , the Earth, into two hemispheres.  If one uses directions of East and West from a defined prime meridian, then they can be called Eastern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere. A prime meridian is ultimately arbitrary, unlike an equator, which is determined by the axis of rotation—and various conventions have been used or advocated in different regions and throughout history. 

William Wilberforce<====>50226<====>William Wilberforce  William Wilberforce (24 August 1759 29 July 1833) was an English politician, philanthropist, and a leader of the movement to stop the slave trade.  A native of Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, he began his political career in 1780, eventually becoming an independent Member of Parliament (MP) for Yorkshire (1784–1812).  In 1785, he became an Evangelical Christian, which resulted in major changes to his lifestyle and a lifelong concern for reform. In 1787, he came into contact with Thomas Clarkson and a group of anti-slave-trade activists, including Granville Sharp, Hannah More and Charles Middleton.  They persuaded Wilberforce to take on the cause of abolition, and he soon became one of the leading English abolitionists.

Battle of Wakefield<====>50234<====>Battle of Wakefield The Battle of Wakefield took place in Sandal Magna near Wakefield, in West Yorkshire in Northern England, on 30 December 1460.  It was a major battle of the Wars of the Roses.  The opposing forces were an army led by nobles loyal to the captive King Henry VI of the House of Lancaster, his Queen Margaret of Anjou and their seven-year-old son Edward, Prince of Wales on one side, and the army of Richard, Duke of York, the rival claimant to the throne, on the other. For several years before the battle, the Duke of York had become increasingly opposed to the weak King Henry's court. 

Battle of Towton<====>50236<====>Battle of Towton   The Battle of Towton was fought during the English Wars of the Roses on 29 March 1461, near the village of Towton in Yorkshire.  It brought about a change of monarchs in England, with the victor, the Yorkist Edward, Duke of York who became King Edward IV (1461–1483) having displaced the Lancastrian King Henry VI (1422–1461) as king, and thus drove the head of the Lancastrians and his key supporters out of the country. It is described as "probably the largest and bloodiest battle ever fought on English soil",   According to chroniclers, more than 50,000 soldiers from the Houses of York and Lancaster fought for hours amidst a snowstorm on that day, which was Palm Sunday. 

Robert Boyle<====>50237<====>Robert Boyle  Robert William Boyle    (25 January 1627 – 31 December 1691) was an Anglo-Irish  natural philosopher, chemist, physicist, and inventor.  Boyle is largely regarded today as the first modern chemist, and therefore one of the founders of modern chemistry, and one of the pioneers of modern experimental scientific method.  He is best known for Boyle's law,    which describes the inversely proportional relationship between the absolute pressure and volume of a gas, if the temperature is kept constant within a closed system.   Among his works, The Sceptical Chymist is seen as a cornerstone book in the field of chemistry. 

Led Zeppelin II<====>50239<====>Led Zeppelin II  Led Zeppelin II is the eponymous second studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, released on 22 October 1969 in the United States and on 31 October 1969 in the United Kingdom by Atlantic Records.  Recording sessions for the album took place at several locations in both the United Kingdom and North America from January to August 1969.  The album's production was credited to the band's lead guitarist and songwriter Jimmy Page, and it also served as Led Zeppelin's first album to utilise the recording techniques of the engineer Eddie Kramer.  Incorporating several elements of blues and folk music, Led Zeppelin II exhibited the band's evolving musical style of blues-derived material and their guitar riff-based sound.

Led Zeppelin III<====>50241<====>Led Zeppelin III Led Zeppelin III is the eponymous third studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, released on 5 October 1970 by Atlantic Records in the United States and on 23 October 1970 in the United Kingdom.  Led Zeppelin III, Led Zeppelin, Atlantic Records, R2-536183, Super Deluxe Edition Box, 2014 Liner Notes, page 3.   The songs were recorded using The Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, Headley Grange, and Hampshire Island Studios Olympic Studios, London.   The album represented a maturing of the band's music towards a greater emphasis on folk and acoustic sounds.  This surprised many fans and critics, and upon its release the album received rather indifferent reviews. 

Led Zeppelin IV<====>50242<====>Led Zeppelin IV   English rock band Led Zeppelin's untitled fourth album, commonly known as Led Zeppelin IV, was released on 8 November 1971 by Atlantic Records.  Produced by guitarist Jimmy Page, it was recorded between November 1970 and January 1971 at several locations, most prominently the Victorian house Headley Grange. After the band's previous album Led Zeppelin III received lukewarm reviews from critics, Page decided their fourth album would officially be untitled.  This, along with the inner sleeve's design featuring four symbols that represented each band member, led to the album being referred to variously as , Four Symbols, The Fourth Album, Untitled, Runes, The Hermit, and ZoSo (which was derived from Page's symbol). 

Houses of the Holy<====>50243<====>Houses of the Holy  Houses of the Holy is the fifth studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, released on 28 March 1973 by Atlantic Records.  It is their first album composed of entirely original material and it represents a turning point in musical direction for the band, who had begun to record songs with more layering and production techniques. Containing some of the band's most famous songs, including "The Song Remains the Same", "The Rain Song", and "No Quarter", Houses of the Holy became a commercial success, and was later certified 11x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1999. 

Sugar beet<====>50245<====>Sugar beet Sugar beet is a plant whose root contains a high concentration of sucrose and which is grown commercially for sugar production.  In plant breeding it is known as the Altissima cultivar group of the common beet (Beta vulgaris).   Together with other beet cultivars, such as beetroot and chard, it belongs to the subspecies Beta vulgaris subsp.  vulgaris.  Its closest wild relative is the Sea beet (Beta vulgaris subsp.  maritima).  In 2013, Russia, France, the United States, Germany, and Turkey were the world's five largest sugar beet producers.   In 2010–2011, North America and Europe did not produce enough sugar from sugar beets to meet overall demand for sugar and were all net importers of sugar. 

Physical Graffiti<====>50246<====>Physical Graffiti Physical Graffiti is the sixth studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, released as a double album on 24 February 1975 by their newly founded imprint label Swan Song Records.  The band wrote and recorded eight new songs for the album at Headley Grange, which stretched the total time of the record beyond the typical length of a single LP, so the band decided to make Physical Graffiti a double album by including unreleased tracks from earlier recording sessions: one outtake from Led Zeppelin III, three from Led Zeppelin IV, and three from Houses of the Holy, including the unused title track from the latter album. 

Presence (album)<====>50247<====>Presence (album) Presence is the seventh studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, released by Swan Song Records on 31 March 1976.  The album was a commercial success, reaching the top of both the British and American album charts, and achieving a triple-platinum certification in the United States, despite receiving mixed reviews from critics and being the slowest-selling studio album by the band (other than the 1982 compilation album Coda). It was written and recorded during a tumultuous time in the band's history, as singer Robert Plant was recuperating from serious injuries he had sustained the previous year in a car accident. 

Canaan<====>50250<====>CanaanCanaan ( ; Northwest Semitic:  ; Phoenician:  𐤊𐤍𐤏𐤍 ; Biblical Hebrew/Masoretic:    ; Ḵənā‘an) was a Semitic-speaking region in the Ancient Near East during the late 2nd millennium BC.  The name Canaan occurs commonly in the Bible, where it corresponds to the Levant, in particular to the areas of the Southern Levant that provide the main setting of the narrative of the Bible: i. e. , the area of Phoenicia, Philistia, Israel and other nations. The word Canaanites serves as an ethnic catch-all term covering various indigenous populations—both settled and nomadic-pastoral groups—throughout the regions of the southern Levant or Canaan.

Canadian Alliance<====>50255<====>Canadian Alliance   The Canadian Alliance ( ), formally the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance ( ), was a conservative  and right-wing populist federal political party in Canada that existed from 2000 to 2003.  The party was the successor to the Reform Party of Canada and inherited its position as the Official Opposition in the House of Commons and held it throughout its existence.  The party supported policies that were both fiscally and socially conservative, seeking reduced government spending on social programs and reductions in taxation. The Alliance was created out of the United Alternative initiative launched by the Reform Party of Canada and several provincial Tory parties as a vehicle to merge with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. 

Steal This Book<====>50262<====>Steal This Book Steal This Book is a book written by Abbie Hoffman.  Written in 1970 and published in 1971, the book exemplified the counterculture of the sixties.  The book sold more than a quarter of a million copies between April and November 1971.  The book, in the style of the counterculture, mainly focused on ways to fight the government, and against corporations in any way possible.  The book is written in the form of a guide to the youth.  Hoffman, a political and social activist himself, used many of his own activities as the inspiration for some of his advice in Steal This Book. 

Domain of a function<====>50263<====>Domain of a function In mathematics, and more specifically in naive set theory, the domain of definition (or simply the domain) of a function is the set of "input" or argument values for which the function is defined.   That is, the function provides an "output"  or value for each member of the domain.    Conversely, the set of values the function takes on as output is termed the image of the function, which is sometimes also referred to as the range of the function. For instance, the domain of cosine is the set of all real numbers, while the domain of the square root consists only of numbers greater than or equal to 0 (ignoring complex numbers in both cases). 

Codomain<====>50264<====>CodomainIn mathematics, the codomain or target set of a function is the set   into which all of the output of the function is constrained to fall.  It is the set   in the notation  .  The codomain is also sometimes referred to as the range but that term is ambiguous as it may also refer to the image. The codomain is part of a function   if it is defined as described in 1954 by Nicolas Bourbaki,  namely a triple  , with   a functional subset  of the Cartesian product   and   is the set of first components of the pairs in   (the domain). 

World's fair<====>50268<====>World's fair A world's fair, world fair, world exposition, or universal exposition (sometimes expo or Expo for short) is a large international exhibition designed to showcase achievements of nations.  These exhibitions vary in character and are held in different parts of the world.  The most recent international exhibition, Expo 2017, was held in Astana, Kazakhstan. Since the 1928 Convention Relating to International Exhibitions came into force, the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE;  ) has served as an international sanctioning body for world's fairs.  BIE-approved fairs are of three types: universal, specialized and horticultural.   They usually last from three weeks to six months.

Symmetric multiprocessing<====>50318<====>Symmetric multiprocessing Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) involves a multiprocessor computer hardware and software architecture where two or more identical processors are connected to a single, shared main memory, have full access to all input and output devices, and are controlled by a single operating system instance that treats all processors equally, reserving none for special purposes.  Most multiprocessor systems today use an SMP architecture.  In the case of multi-core processors, the SMP architecture applies to the cores, treating them as separate processors. SMP systems are tightly coupled multiprocessor systems with a pool of homogeneous processors running independently of each other.

Cognitive neuroscience<====>50326<====>Cognitive neuroscience   The term cognitive neuroscience was coined by George Armitage Miller and Michael Gazzaniga in year 1976.   Cognitive neuroscience is the scientific field that is concerned with the study of the biological processes and aspects that underlie cognition,  with a specific focus on the neural connections in the brain which are involved in mental processes.  It addresses the questions of how cognitive activities are affected or controlled by neural circuits in the brain.   Cognitive neuroscience is a branch of both neuroscience and psychology, overlapping with disciplines such as physiological psychology, cognitive psychology, and neuropsychology. 

Communication complexity<====>50329<====>Communication complexity In theoretical computer science, the notion of communication complexity tries to quantify the amount of communication required for such distributed computations.  It was introduced by Yao in 1979,   who investigated the following problem involving two separated parties (Alice and Bob).  Alice receives an n-bit string x and Bob another n-bit string y, and the goal is for one of them (say Bob) to compute a certain function f(x,y) with the least amount of communication between them.  Note that here we are not concerned about the number of computational steps, or the size of the computer memory used.

Fructose<====>50337<====>Fructose Fructose, or fruit sugar, is a simple ketonic monosaccharide found in many plants, where it is often bonded to glucose to form the disaccharide, sucrose.  It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose, that are absorbed directly into blood during digestion.  Fructose was discovered by French chemist Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1847.The name “fructose” was coined in 1857 by the English chemist, William Allen Miller. Pure, dry fructose is a sweet, white, odorless, crystalline solid, and is the most water-soluble of all the sugars.

Urban design<====>50345<====>Urban designUrban design is the process of designing and shaping cities, towns and villages.  In contrast to architecture, which focuses on the design of individual buildings, urban design deals with the larger scale of groups of buildings, streets and public spaces, whole neighborhoods and districts, and entire cities, with the goal of making urban areas functional, attractive, and sustainable.    Urban design is an inter-disciplinary subject that utilizes elements of many built environment professions, including landscape architecture, urban planning, architecture, civil and municipal engineering.

Multivariate normal distribution<====>50347<====>Multivariate normal distribution  In probability theory and statistics, the multivariate normal distribution or multivariate Gaussian distribution is a generalization of the one-dimensional (univariate) normal distribution to higher dimensions.   One definition is that a random vector is said to be k-variate normally distributed if every linear combination of its k components has a univariate normal distribution.  Its importance derives mainly from the multivariate central limit theorem.  The multivariate normal distribution is often used to describe, at least approximately, any set of (possibly) correlated real-valued random variables each of which clusters around a mean value. Notation and parametrizationThe multivariate normal distribution of a k-dimensional random vector   can be written in the following notation:    \mathbf{X}\ \sim\ \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol\mu,\, \boldsymbol\Sigma),  or to make it explicitly known that X is k-dimensional,    \mathbf{X}\ \sim\ \mathcal{N}_k(\boldsymbol\mu,\, \boldsymbol\Sigma),  with k-dimensional mean vector  \boldsymbol\mu = \operatorname{E}[\mathbf{X}] = [ \operatorname{E}[X_1], \operatorname{E}[X_2], \ldots, \operatorname{E}[X_k]]^{\rm T},  and  k \times k  covariance matrix  \boldsymbol\Sigma = :\operatorname{E} [(\mathbf{X} - \boldsymbol \mu)( \mathbf{X} - \boldsymbol \mu)^{\rm T}] =  [ \operatorname{Cov}[X_i, X_j]; 1 \le i,j \le k ].

With a mayor-alderman form of government, it is one of two cities in Kentucky designated by the state as first-class; the other is the state's largest city of Louisville.   In the 2016 U. S.  Census Estimate, the city's population was 318,449, anchoring a metropolitan area of 506,751 people and a combined statistical area of 723,849 people. 

Precautionary principle<====>50354<====>Precautionary principle  The precautionary principle (or precautionary approach) generally defines actions on issues considered to be uncertain, for instance applied in assessing risk management.   The principle is used by policy makers to justify discretionary decisions in situations where there is the possibility of harm from making a certain decision (e. g.  taking a particular course of action) when extensive scientific knowledge on the matter is lacking.  The principle implies that there is a social responsibility to protect the public from exposure to harm, when scientific investigation has found a plausible risk.  These protections can be relaxed only if further scientific findings emerge that provide sound evidence that no harm will result. 

Informed consent<====>50355<====>Informed consent  Informed consent is a process for getting permission before conducting a healthcare intervention on a person, or for disclosing personal information.  A health care provider may ask a patient to consent to receive therapy before providing it, or a clinical researcher may ask a research participant before enrolling that person into a clinical trial.  Informed consent is collected according to guidelines from the fields of medical ethics and research ethics. An informed consent can be said to have been given based upon a clear appreciation and understanding of the facts, implications, and consequences of an action.

Larva<====>50357<====>Larva  A larva (plural: larvae  ) is a distinct juvenile form many  animals undergo before metamorphosis into adults.  Animals with indirect development such as insects, amphibians, or cnidarians typically have a larval phase of their life cycle. The larva's appearance is generally very different from the adult form (e. g.  caterpillars and butterflies).  A larva often has unique structures and organs that do not occur in the adult form.  Their diet may also be considerably different. Larvae are frequently adapted to environments separate from adults.  For example, some larvae such as tadpoles live almost exclusively in aquatic environments, but can live outside water as adult frogs. 

Indigo dye<====>50363<====>Indigo dye Indigo dye is an organic compound with a distinctive blue color (see indigo).   Historically, indigo was a natural dye extracted from the leaves of certain plants, and this process was important economically because blue dyes were once rare.   A large percentage of indigo dye produced today – several thousand tons each year – is synthetic.  It is the blue often associated with blue jeans. UsesThe primary use for indigo is as a dye for cotton yarn, which is mainly for the production of denim cloth for blue jeans.  On average, a pair of blue jean trousers requires 3–12 g of indigo. 

Lambert Simnel<====>50368<====>Lambert Simnel    Lambert Simnel (c.  1477 – c.  1525) was an imposter to the throne of England.  His claim to be the Earl of Warwick in 1487 threatened the newly established reign of King Henry VII (reigned 1485–1509).  Simnel became the figurehead of a Yorkist rebellion organised by John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln.  The rebellion was crushed in 1487.  Simnel was pardoned and was thereafter employed by the Royal household as a scullion, and, later, as a falconer . Early lifeSimnel was born around 1477.  His real name is not known – contemporary records call him John, not Lambert, and even his surname is suspect. 

Photios I of Constantinople<====>50371<====>Photios I of Constantinople    Photios I (  Phōtios;  ),  also spelled Photius Fr.  Justin Taylor, essay "Canon Law in the Age of the Fathers" (published in Jordan Hite, T. O. R. , & Daniel J.  Ward, O. S. B. , "Readings, Cases, Materials in Canon Law: A Textbook for Ministerial Students, Revised Edition" [Collegeville, MN: The Liturgical Press, 1990]), p.  61  ( ) or Fotios, was the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 858 to 867 and from 877 to 886;  He is recognized in the Eastern Orthodox Church as St. 

Paul Revere<====>50372<====>Paul Revere    Paul Revere ( ; December 21, 1734 O. S.  May 10, 1818Revere's date of birth is confused by the conversion between the Julian and Gregorian calendars, which offsets the date by 11 days, and by the fact that only his baptism, not his actual birth was recorded.   While his baptism was recorded on December 22, adjusting for the conversion between Julian and Gregorian calendars changes the date to January 1.   ) was an American silversmith, engraver, early industrialist, and Patriot in the American Revolution.  He is best known for his midnight ride to alert the colonial militia in April 1775 to the approach of British forces before the battles of Lexington and Concord, as dramatized in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem, "Paul Revere's Ride" (1861). 

Type B Cipher Machine<====>50373<====>Type B Cipher Machine  In the history of cryptography,   or  , codenamed Purple by the United States, was a diplomatic cryptographic machine used by the Japanese Foreign Office just before and during World War II.  The machine was an electromechanical stepping-switch device using a 6 X 25 substitution table.  The codename "Purple" referred to binders used by US cryptanalysts for material produced by various systems; it replaced the Red machine used by the Japanese Foreign Office.  The Japanese also used Coral and JADE stepping-switch systems.  American forces referred to information gained from decryptions as Magic. 

Internet relationship<====>50375<====>Internet relationshipAn internet relationship is a relationship between people who have met online, and in many cases know each other only via the Internet.  Online relationships are similar in many ways to pen pal relationships.  This relationship can be romantic, platonic, or even based on business affairs.  An internet relationship (or online relationship) is generally sustained for a certain amount of time before being titled a relationship, just as in-person relationships.  The major difference here is that an internet relationship is sustained via computer or online service, and the individuals in the relationship may or may not ever meet each other in person. 

Dragonflight<====>50376<====>Dragonflight  Dragonflight is a science fiction novel by the American-Irish author Anne McCaffrey.  It is the first book in the Dragonriders of Pern series.  Dragonflight was first published by Ballantine Books in July 1968.   It is a fix-up of novellas, including two which made McCaffrey the first woman writer to win a Hugo and Nebula Award.  In 1987, Locus: The magazine of the science fiction & fantasy field ranked Dragonflight at number nine among the 33 "All-Time Best Fantasy Novels", based on a poll of subscribers.  OriginsTwo components of Dragonflight were award-winning novellas published by Analog science fiction magazine. 

High-speed rail<====>50378<====>High-speed rail   High-speed rail is a type of rail transport that operates significantly faster than traditional rail traffic, using an integrated system of specialized rolling stock and dedicated tracks.   While there is no single standard that applies worldwide, new lines in excess of   and existing lines in excess of   are widely considered to be high-speed, with some extending the definition to include lower speeds in areas for which these speeds still represent significant improvements.The first such system began operations in Japan in 1964 and was widely known as the bullet train. 

Illinois and Michigan Canal<====>50379<====>Illinois and Michigan Canal The Illinois and Michigan Canal connected the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.  In Illinois, it ran   from the Chicago River in Bridgeport, Chicago to the Illinois River at LaSalle-Peru.  The canal crossed the Chicago Portage and helped establish Chicago as the transportation hub of the United States, before the railroad era.  It was opened in 1848, its function was largely replaced by the wider and shorter Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal in 1900 and it ceased transportation operations with the completion of the Illinois Waterway in 1933. 

National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality<====>50380<====>National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality The National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH), also known as the NARTH Institute, is a US organization that offers conversion therapy and other regimens that purport to change the sexual orientation of people with same-sex attraction.  NARTH has been described by a Christian ministry group as a ministry partner that is "a multi-disciplinary professional and scientific organization dedicated to the service of persons who experience unwanted homosexual (same-sex) attractions (SSA)".   NARTH was founded in 1992 by Joseph Nicolosi, Benjamin Kaufman, and  Charles Socarides.  Its headquarters are in Encino, California, at the Thomas Aquinas Psychological Clinic and has operated under the Alliance for Therapeutic Choice and Scientific Integrity (ATCSI) since 2014. 

Containerization<====>50387<====>Containerization   Containerization is a system of intermodal freight transport using intermodal containers (also called shipping containers and ISO containers).The containers have standardized dimensions.  They can be loaded and unloaded, stacked, transported efficiently over long distances, and transferred from one mode of transport to another—container ships, rail transport flatcars, and semi-trailer trucks—without being opened.  The handling system is completely mechanized so that all handling is done with cranesand special forklift trucks.   All containers are numbered and tracked using computerized systems. Containerization originated several centuries ago but was not well developed or widely applied until after World War II, when it dramatically reduced the costs of transport, supported the post-war boom in international trade, and was a major element in globalization. 

Georg Joachim Rheticus<====>50392<====>Georg Joachim Rheticus Georg Joachim de Porris, also known as Rheticus (16 February 1514 – 4 December 1574), was a mathematician, astronomer, cartographer, navigational-instrument maker, medical practitioner, and teacher.  He is perhaps best known for his trigonometric tables and as Nicolaus Copernicus's sole pupil.  Danielson, p.  3.   He facilitated the publication of his master's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres). SurnameRheticus was born at Feldkirch in the Archduchy of Austria.  Both his parents, Georg Iserin and Thomasina de Porris, possessed considerable wealth, his father being the town physician.  However, Georg (Iserin) abused the trust of many of his patients, stealing belongings and money from their homes. 

Cerebellum<====>50397<====>Cerebellum  The cerebellum (Latin for "little brain") is a major feature of the hindbrain of all vertebrates.   Although usually smaller than the cerebrum, in some animals such as the mormyrid fishes it may be as large as or even larger.   In humans, the cerebellum plays an important role in motor control, and it may also be involved in some cognitive functions such as attention and language as well as in regulating fear and pleasure responses,  but its movement-related functions are the most solidly established.  The human cerebellum does not initiate movement, but contributes to coordination, precision, and accurate timing: it receives input from sensory systems of the spinal cord and from other parts of the brain, and integrates these inputs to fine-tune motor activity. 

Kiss<====>50399<====>Kiss  A kiss is the touch or pressing of one's lips against another person or an object.  Cultural connotations of kissing vary widely.  Depending on the culture and context, a kiss can express sentiments of love, passion, romance, sexual attraction, sexual activity, sexual arousal, affection, respect, greeting, friendship, peace, and good luck, among many others.  In some situations, a kiss is a ritual, formal or symbolic gesture indicating devotion, respect, or sacrament.  The word came from Old English   ("to kiss"), in turn from coss ("a kiss"). HistoryAnthropologists are divided into two schools on the origins of kissing, one believing that it is instinctual and intuitive and the other that it evolved from what is known as kiss feeding, a process used by mothers to feed their infants by passing chewed food to their babies' mouths. 

Dream interpretation<====>50400<====>Dream interpretation Dream interpretation is the process of assigning meaning to dreams.  In many ancient societies, such as those of Egypt and Greece, dreaming was considered a supernatural communication or a means of divine intervention, whose message could be interpreted by people with these associated spiritual powers. In modern times, various schools of psychology and neurobiology have offered theories about the meaning and purpose of dreams.  Most people currently appear to interpret dream content according to the Freudian theory of dreams in countries, as found by a study conducted in the United States, India, and South Korea.  People appear to believe dreams are particularly meaningful: they assign more meaning to dreams than to similar waking thoughts. 

Clergy<====>50405<====>Clergy Clergy are some of the main and important formal leaders within certain religions.   The roles and functions of clergy vary in different religious traditions but these usually involve presiding over specific rituals and teaching their religion's doctrines and practices.  Some of the terms used for individual clergy are clergyman, clergywoman and churchman.  Less common terms are churchwoman, clergyperson and cleric. In Christianity the specific names and roles of clergy vary by denomination and there is a wide range of formal and informal clergy positions, including deacons, elders, priests, bishops, preachers, pastors, ministers and the Pope. 

Post-Keynesian economics<====>50406<====>Post-Keynesian economics  Post-Keynesian economics is a school of economic thought with its origins in The General Theory of John Maynard Keynes, with subsequent development influenced to a large degree by Michał Kalecki, Joan Robinson, Nicholas Kaldor, Paul Davidson, Piero Sraffa and Jan Kregel.   Historian Robert Skidelsky argues that the post-Keynesian school has remained closest to the spirit of Keynes' original work.   IntroductionThe term post-Keynesian was first used to refer to a distinct school of economic thought by Eichner and Kregel (1975)  and by the establishment of the Journal of Post Keynesian Economics in 1978. 

Computer engineering<====>50408<====>Computer engineering   Computer engineering is a discipline that integrates several fields of electrical engineering and computer science required to develop computer hardware and software.   Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering (or electrical engineering), software design, and hardware–software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering.  Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design.  This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work, but also how they integrate into the larger picture. 

Cistercians<====>50409<====>Cistercians A Cistercian is a member of the Cistercian Order ( ,  abbreviated as OCist or SOCist ( ), a religious order of monks and nuns.  They are variously called the Bernardines, after the highly influential St.  Bernard of Clairvaux (though the term is also used of the Franciscan Order in Poland and Lithuania), or the White Monks, in reference to the colour of the "cuccula" or white choir robe worn by the Cistercians over their habits, as opposed to the black cuccula worn by Benedictine monks.  The original emphasis of Cistercian life was on manual labour and self-sufficiency, and many abbeys have traditionally supported themselves through activities such as agriculture and brewing ales. 

Sierra Nevada (U.S.)<====>50413<====>Sierra Nevada (U. S. )  The Sierra Nevada ( ,  , snowy saw range ) is a mountain range in the Western United States, between the Central Valley of California and the Basin and Range Province.  The vast majority of the range lies in the state of California, although the Carson Range spur lies primarily in Nevada.  The Sierra Nevada is part of the American Cordillera, a chain of mountain ranges that consists of an almost continuous sequence of such ranges that form the western "backbone" of North America, Central America, South America and Antarctica. The Sierra runs   north-to-south, and is approximately   across east-to-west. 

Differential calculus<====>50416<====>Differential calculus In mathematics, differential calculus is a sub field of calculus concerned with the study of the rates at which quantities change.  It is one of the two traditional divisions of calculus, the other being integral calculus. The primary objects of study in differential calculus are the derivative of a function, related notions such as the differential, and their applications.  The derivative of a function at a chosen input value describes the rate of change of the function near that input value.   The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation.  Geometrically, the derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point, provided that the derivative exists and is defined at that point. 

Billie Holiday<====>50420<====>Billie Holiday   Eleanora Fagan (April 7, 1915 – July 17, 1959), better known as Billie Holiday, was an American jazz musician and singer-songwriter with a career spanning nearly thirty years.  Nicknamed "Lady Day" by her friend and music partner Lester Young, Holiday had a seminal influence on jazz music and pop singing.  Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo.  She was known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills, which made up for her limited range and lack of formal music education.  After a turbulent childhood, Holiday began singing in nightclubs in Harlem, where she was heard by the producer John Hammond, who commended her voice.

Quantum Hall effect<====>50425<====>Quantum Hall effectThe quantum Hall effect (or integer quantum Hall effect) is a quantum-mechanical version of the Hall effect, observed in two-dimensional electron systems subjected to low temperatures and strong magnetic fields, in which the Hall conductance σ undergoes quantum Hall transitions to take on the quantized values  \sigma = \frac{I_\text{channel}}{V_\text{Hall}} = \nu \; \frac{e^2}{h},  where   I_\text{channel}  is the channel current,  V_\text{Hall}  is the Hall voltage, e is the elementary charge and h is Planck's constant.  The prefactor  \nu  is known as the "filling factor", and can take on either integer ( \nu   = 1, 2, 3, . 

Colloquial Finnish<====>50432<====>Colloquial Finnish Colloquial Finnish (suomen puhekieli) is the standard colloquial dialect of the Finnish language.  It is spoken in the Greater Helsinki region, and in urbanized areas in the Tavastian and Central Finland dialectal areas, such as the cities of Tampere, Jyväskylä, Lahti, Hyvinkää, and Hämeenlinna.  In addition, this applies also to the coastal cities, such as Vaasa and Porvoo,  which have been traditionally Swedish-speaking, and have experienced an influx of Finnish speakers from a variety of dialectal areas. The standard language takes most of its features from these dialects, i. e.  most "dialectal" features are reductions with respect to this form of language.

Led Zeppelin Remasters<====>50461<====>Led Zeppelin Remasters  Led Zeppelin Remasters is a three-LP (or two-cassette or two-CD) compilation album of digitally remastered material by English rock band Led Zeppelin.  Containing songs from eight of the band's nine studio albums, it was initially released in the UK and Japan by Atlantic Records on 15 October 1990.  The album is essentially a scaled-down version of the four-CD Led Zeppelin Boxed Set. This compilation set came about as a result of the initially rushed conversion of Led Zeppelin's album to the compact disc format in the late 1980s.  Led Zeppelin were among the first rock bands to be re-issued on CD, but such was the haste to capitalise on the new format that the new CDs were derived not from re-equalised master tapes, but from sound-generation tapes that had been equalised for the original vinyl platters.

Gargoyle<====>50473<====>Gargoyle   In architecture,  a gargoyle ( ) is a carved or formed grotesque  with a spout designed to convey water from a roof and away from the side of a building, thereby preventing rainwater from running down masonry walls and eroding the mortar between.  Architects often used multiple gargoyles on buildings to divide the flow of rainwater off the roof to minimize the potential damage from a rainstorm.  A trough is cut in the back of the gargoyle and rainwater typically exits through the open mouth.  Gargoyles are usually an elongated fantastical animal because the length of the gargoyle determines how far water is directed from the wall.

Flood<====>50482<====>Flood   A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry.   The European Union (EU) Floods Directive defines a flood as a  covering by water of land not normally covered by water.   In the sense of "flowing water", the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide. Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river, lake, or ocean, in which the water overtops or breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries,  or it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood. 

Goose<====>50484<====>Goose   Geese are waterfowl of the family Anatidae.  This group comprises the genera Anser (the grey geese) and Branta (the black geese).  Chen, a genus comprising 'white geese', is sometimes used to refer to a group of species that are more commonly placed within Anser.  Some other birds, mostly related to the shelducks, have "goose" as part of their names.  More distantly related members of the family Anatidae are swans, most of which are larger than true geese, and ducks, which are smaller. EtymologyThe word "goose" is a direct descendent of Proto-Indo-European root, *ghans-. 

Debugger<====>50485<====>Debugger A debugger or debugging tool is a computer program that is used to test and debug other programs (the "target" program).  The code to be examined might alternatively be running on an instruction set simulator (ISS), a technique that allows great power in its ability to halt when specific conditions are encountered, but which will typically be somewhat slower than executing the code directly on the appropriate (or the same) processor.  Some debuggers offer two modes of operation, full or partial simulation, to limit this impact. A "trap" occurs when the program cannot normally continue because of a programming bug or invalid data.

Mule<====>50505<====>Mule  A mule is the offspring of a male donkey (jack) and a female horse (mare). Horses and donkeys are different species, with different numbers of chromosomes.  Of the two F1 hybrids (first generation hybrids) between these two species, a mule is easier to obtain than a hinny, which is the offspring of a female donkey (jenny) and a male horse (stallion).

When now used in an ecclesiastical sense, it refers to an administrative territorial entity.  Cross, F. L.  & Livingstone, E. A.  "Diocese" in The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church OUP (1974)  In the Western Church, the district is under the supervision of a bishop (who may have assistant bishops to help him or her) and is divided into parishes under the care of priests; but in the Eastern Church, the word denotes the area under the jurisdiction of a patriarch and the bishops under his jurisdictionadminister parishes. 

Oakland, Maryland<====>50550<====>Oakland, MarylandFor other places with the same name, see Oakland.  Oakland is a town in the west-central part of Garrett County, Maryland.  The town has a population of 1,925 according to the 2010 United States Census.  The town is also the county seat of Garrett County and is located within the Pittsburgh DMA. Oakland is situated only miles from the source of the Potomac River, which flows directly into the Chesapeake Bay.  It is also near the Wisp Resort at Deep Creek Lake, a major ski resort for many Marylanders and other visitors. HistoryOakland was formally incorporated as a town in 1862. 

James V of Scotland<====>50552<====>James V of Scotland   James V (10 April 1512 – 14 December 1542) was King of Scots from 9 September 1513 until his death, which followed the Scottish defeat at the Battle of Solway Moss.  His only surviving legitimate child, Mary I, succeeded him when she was just six days old. Early lifeJames was son of King James IV of Scotland and his wife Margaret Tudor, a daughter of Henry VII of England and sister of Henry VIII, and was the only legitimate child of James IV to survive infancy.   He was born on 10 April 1512 at Linlithgow Palace, Linlithgowshire and baptized the following day, receiving the titles Duke of Rothesay and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland. 

Pseudotsuga<====>50553<====>Pseudotsuga  Pseudotsuga    is a genus of evergreen coniferous trees in the family Pinaceae (subfamily Laricoideae).  Common names include Douglas fir, Douglas-fir, Douglas tree, and Oregon pine.  Pseudotsuga menziesii is widespread in western North America and is an important source of timber.  The number of species has long been debated, but two in western North America and two to four in eastern Asia are commonly acknowledged.    Nineteenth-century botanists had problems in classifying Douglas-firs, due to the species' similarity to various other conifers better known at the time; they have at times been classified in Pinus, Picea, Abies, Tsuga, and even Sequoia. 

Domoic acid<====>50555<====>Domoic acid Domoic acid (DA) is a kainic acid analog neurotoxin that causes amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP).   It is produced by algae and accumulates in shellfish, sardines, and anchovies.  When sea lions, otters, cetaceans, humans, and other predators eat contaminated animals, poisoning may result.  Exposure to this compound affects the brain, causing seizures, and possibly death.  HistoryThere has been little use of domoic acid throughout history except for in Japan, where it has been used as an anthelmintic for centuries. Domoic acid was first isolated in 1959 from a species of red algae, Chondria armata, in Japan; commonly referred to as "doumoi" (in Tokunoshima's dialect word) or "hanayanagi". 

James IV of Scotland<====>50556<====>James IV of Scotland   James IV (17 March 1473 – 9 September 1513) was the King of Scotland from 11 June 1488 to his death.  He assumed the throne following the death of his father, King James III, (1451/52–1488, reigned 1460–1488) in the Battle of Sauchieburn, a rebellion in which the younger James played an indirect role.  He is generally regarded as the most successful of the Stewart monarchs of Scotland, but his reign ended in a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Flodden, where he became the last monarch not only from Scotland, but from all of Great Britain, to be killed in battle. 

Phytoplankton<====>50557<====>Phytoplankton Phytoplankton   are the autotrophic (self-feeding) components of the plankton community and a key part of oceans, seas and freshwater basin ecosystems.  The name comes from the Greek words φυτόν (phyton), meaning "plant", and πλαγκτός (planktos), meaning "wanderer" or "drifter".   Most phytoplankton are too small to be individually seen with the unaided eye.  However, when present in high enough numbers, some varieties may be noticeable as colored patches on the water surface due to the presence of chlorophyll within their cells and accessory pigments (such as phycobiliproteins or xanthophylls) in some species. Ecology Phytoplankton are photosynthesizing microscopic organisms that inhabit the upper sunlit layer of almost all oceans and bodies of fresh water on Earth. 

Zooplankton<====>50558<====>ZooplanktonZooplankton (pronounced in several different ways, including    or  .  ) are heterotrophic (sometimes detritivorous) plankton.  Plankton are organisms drifting in oceans, seas, and bodies of fresh water.  The word "zooplankton" is derived from the Greek zoon ( ), meaning "animal", and   ( ), meaning "wanderer" or "drifter".    Individual zooplankton are usually microscopic, but some (such as jellyfish) are larger and visible with the naked eye.  EcologyZooplankton is a categorization spanning a range of organism sizes including small protozoans and large metazoans.   It includes holoplanktonic organisms whose complete life cycle lies within the plankton, as well as meroplanktonic organisms that spend part of their lives in the plankton before graduating to either the nekton or a sessile, benthic existence. 

Albany County, New York<====>50559<====>Albany County, New York  Albany County (   ) is a county in the state of New York, in the United States.  Its northern border is formed by the Mohawk River, at its confluence with the Hudson River, which is on the east.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 304,204. The county seat is Albany,    the state capital of New York.  As originally established by the English government in the colonial era, Albany County had an indefinite amount of land, but has had an area of    since March 3, 1888. 

Lemures<====>50560<====>Lemures The lemures   were shades or spirits of the restless or malignant dead in Roman mythology,  and are probably cognate with an extended sense of larvae   (from Latin larva, "mask") as disturbing or frightening.    Lemures is the more common literary term but even this is rare: it is used by the Augustan poets Horace and Ovid, the latter in his Fasti, the six-book calendar poem on Roman holidays and religious customs.  The word lemures can be traced to the PIE stem * , which also appears in the name of the Greek monster Lamia. 

Smyrna<====>50562<====>Smyrna   Smyrna (Ancient Greek: Σμύρνη, Smýrni or Σμύρνα, Smýrna) was a Greek city dating back to antiquity located at a central and strategic point on the Aegean coast of Anatolia.  This place was renamed to İzmir, Turkey.  Due to its advantageous port conditions, its ease of defence and its good inland connections, Smyrna rose to prominence.  Two sites of the ancient city are today within the boundaries of İzmir.  The first site, probably founded by indigenous peoples, rose to prominence during the Archaic Period as one of the principal ancient Greek settlements in western Anatolia. 

Sucrose<====>50563<====>Sucrose Sucrose  is common table sugar.  It is a disaccharide, a molecule composed of the two monosaccharides, glucose and fructose.  Sucrose is produced naturally in plants, from which table sugar is refined.  It has the formula C 12 H 22 O 11 . For human consumption, sucrose is extracted, and refined, from either sugar cane or sugar beet.  Sugar mills are located where sugar cane is grown to crush the cane and produce raw sugar which is shipped around the world for refining into pure sucrose.   Some sugar mills also process the raw sugar into pure sucrose. 

Gray code<====>50564<====>Gray code The reflected binary code (RBC), also known just as reflected binary (RB) or Gray code after Frank Gray, is an ordering of the binary numeral system such that two successive values differ in only one bit (binary digit). The reflected binary code was originally designed to prevent spurious output from electromechanical switches.  Today, Gray codes are widely used to facilitate error correction in digital communications such as digital terrestrial television and some cable TV systems.  Name Bell Labs researcher Frank Gray introduced the term reflected binary code in his 1947 patent application, remarking that the code had "as yet no recognized name". 

Gold code<====>50567<====>Gold code A Gold code, also known as Gold sequence, is a type of binary sequence, used in telecommunication (CDMA)  and satellite navigation (GPS).   Gold codes are named after Robert Gold.    Gold codes have bounded small cross-correlations within a set, which is useful when multiple devices are broadcasting in the same frequency range.   A set of Gold code sequences consists of 2 n  − 1 sequences each one with a period of 2 n  − 1. A set of Gold codes can be generated with the following steps.   Pick two maximum length sequences of the same length 2 n  − 1 such that their absolute cross-correlation is less than or equal to 2 (n+2)/2 , where n is the size of the LFSR used to generate the maximum length sequence (Gold '67). 

Personal rapid transit<====>50568<====>Personal rapid transitPersonal rapid transit (PRT), also referred to as podcars, is a public transport mode featuring small automated vehicles operating on a network of specially built guideways.  PRT is a type of automated guideway transit (AGT), a class of system which also includes larger vehicles all the way to small subway systems. PRT vehicles are sized for individual or small group travel, typically carrying no more than three to six passengers per vehicle.   Guideways are arranged in a network topology, with all stations located on sidings, and with frequent merge/diverge points.  This allows for nonstop, point-to-point travel, bypassing all intermediate stations. 

Transportation engineering<====>50571<====>Transportation engineering Transportation engineering or transport engineering is the application of technology and scientific principles to the planning, functional design, operation and management of facilities for any mode of transportation in order to provide for the safe, efficient, rapid, comfortable, convenient, economical, and environmentally compatible movement of people and goods (transport)  .   It is a sub-discipline of civil engineering.The importance of transportation engineering within the civil engineering profession can be judged by the number of divisions in ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers) that are directly related to transportation.  There are six such divisions (Aerospace; Air Transportation; Highway; Pipeline; Waterway, Port, Coastal and Ocean; and Urban Transportation) representing one-third of the total 18 technical divisions within the ASCE (1987). 

Queueing theory<====>50578<====>Queueing theoryQueueing theory is the mathematical study of waiting lines, or  .A queueing model is constructed so that queue lengths and waiting time can be predicted.   Queueing theory is generally considered a branch of operations research because the results are often used when making business decisions about the resources needed to provide a service. Queueing theory has its origins in research by Agner Krarup Erlang when he created models to describe the Copenhagen telephone exchange.   The ideas have since seen applications including telecommunication, traffic engineering, computing and, particularly in industrial engineering, in the design of factories, shops, offices and hospitals, as well as in project management. 

Gaussian quadrature<====>50579<====>Gaussian quadrature In numerical analysis, a quadrature rule is an approximation of the definite integral of a function, usually stated as a weighted sum of function values at specified points within the domain of integration. (See numerical integration for more on quadrature rules. ) An n-point Gaussian quadrature rule, named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, is a quadrature rule constructed to yield an exact result for polynomials of degree   or less by a suitable choice of the points   and weights   for  .  The domain of integration for such a rule is conventionally taken as [−1, 1], so the rule is stated as \int_{-1}^1 f(x)\,dx = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i f(x_i). 

Orange County, Texas<====>50580<====>Orange County, Texas  Orange County is a county in the U. S.  state of Texas.  As of the 2010 census, its population was 81,837.The county seat is Orange.    Orange County is included in the Beaumont-Port Arthur, TX Metropolitan Statistical Area.  It is located in the very southeastern corner of Texas, with a boundary with Louisiana, within the Golden Triangle of Texas. HistoryOrange County was formed in 1852 from portions of Jefferson County.   It was named after the orange fruit, the common citrus fruit grown by the early settlers of this County near the mouth of the Sabine River. 

Zircon<====>50582<====>Zircon   Zircon (    or   ) is a mineral belonging to the group of nesosilicates.  Its chemical name is zirconium silicate and its corresponding chemical formula is ZrSiO 4 .  A common empirical formula showing some of the range of substitution in zircon is (Zr 1–y , REE y )(SiO 4 ) 1–x (OH) 4x–y .  Zircon forms in silicate melts with large proportions of high field strength incompatible elements.  For example, hafnium is almost always present in quantities ranging from 1 to 4%.  The crystal structure of zircon is tetragonal crystal system. 

Philadelphia<====>50585<====>Philadelphia Philadelphia ( ) is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the sixth-most populous city in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,567,872  and more than 6 million in the seventh-largest metropolitan statistical area,  .   Philadelphia is the economic and cultural anchor of the Delaware Valley, located along the lower Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers, within both the Mid-Atlantic region and the Northeast megalopolis.  The Delaware Valley's population of 7. 2 million ranks it as the eighth-largest combined statistical area in the United States.  William Penn, an English Quaker, founded the city in 1682 to serve as capital of the Pennsylvania Colony. 

Expo 67<====>50588<====>Expo 67   The 1967 International and Universal Exposition or Expo 67, as it was commonly known, was a general exhibition, Category One World's Fair held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, from April 27 to October 29, 1967.   It is considered to be the most successful World's Fair of the 20th century   with the most attendees to that date and 62 nations participating.   It also set the single-day attendance record for a world's fair, with 569,500 visitors on its third day. Expo 67 was Canada's main celebration during its centennial year.  The fair had been intended to be held in Moscow, to help the Soviet Union celebrate the Russian Revolution's 50th anniversary; however, for various reasons, the Soviets decided to cancel, and Canada was awarded it in late 1962. 

Spanking<====>50589<====>Spanking   Spanking is a common form of corporal punishment involving the act of striking the buttocks of another person to cause physical pain, generally with an open hand.  More severe forms of spanking, such as switching, paddling, belting, caning, whipping, and birching, involve the use of an implement instead of a hand. Parents commonly spank children or adolescents in response to undesired behavior.Boys are more frequently spanked than girls, both at home and in school.   Some countries have outlawed the spanking of children in every setting, including homes, schools, and penal institutions, but most allow it when done by a parent or guardian. 

United States Postal Service<====>50591<====>United States Postal Service   The United States Postal Service (USPS; also known as the Post Office, U. S.  Mail, or Postal Service) is an independent agency of the United States federal government responsible for providing postal service in the United States, including its insular areas and associated states.  It is one of the few government agencies explicitly authorized by the United States Constitution. The U. S.  Mail traces its roots to 1775 during the Second Continental Congress, when Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first postmaster general.  The Post Office Department was created in 1792 from Franklin's operation, elevated to a cabinet-level department in 1872, and transformed in 1971 into the U. 

Hyperlexia<====>50592<====>HyperlexiaHyperlexia is a syndrome characterized by a child's precocious ability to read.  It was initially identified by Norman E.  Silberberg and Margaret C.  Silberberg (1967), who defined it as the precocious ability to read words without prior training in learning to read, typically before the age of 5.  They indicated that children with hyperlexia have a significantly higher word-decoding ability than their reading comprehension levels.   Children with hyperlexia also present with an intense fascination for written material at a very early age.    Hyperlexic children are characterized by having average or above-average IQs, and word-reading ability well above what would be expected given their age. 

Flash memory<====>50595<====>Flash memory    Flash memory is an electronic (solid-state) non-volatile computer storage medium that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed. Toshiba developed flash memory from EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory) in the early 1980s and introduced it to the market in 1984.  The two main types of flash memory are named after the NAND and NOR logic gates.  The individual flash memory cells exhibit internal characteristics similar to those of the corresponding gates. While EPROMs  had to be completely erased before being rewritten, NAND-type flash memory may be written and read in blocks (or pages) which are generally much smaller than the entire device. 

EEPROM<====>50597<====>EEPROM  EEPROM (also E 2 PROM) stands for electrically erasable programmable read-only memory and is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices to store relatively small amounts of data but allowing individual bytes to be erased and reprogrammed. EEPROMs are organized as arrays of floating-gate transistors.  EEPROMs can be programmed and erased in-circuit, by applying special programming signals.  Originally, EEPROMs were limited to single byte operations which made them slower, but modern EEPROMs allow multi-byte page operations.  It also has a limited life for erasing and reprogramming, now reaching a million operations in modern EEPROMs. 

Cystic fibrosis<====>50601<====>Cystic fibrosis  Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that affects mostly the lungs, but also the pancreas, liver, kidneys, and intestine.    Long-term issues include difficulty breathing and coughing up mucus as a result of frequent lung infections.   Other signs and symptoms may include sinus infections, poor growth, fatty stool, clubbing of the fingers and toes, and infertility in most males.   Different people may have different degrees of symptoms.   CF is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.   It is caused by the presence of mutations in both copies of the gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. 

Multiple sclerosis<====>50603<====>Multiple sclerosis    Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease in which the insulating covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged.This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems.    Specific symptoms can include double vision, blindness in one eye, muscle weakness, trouble with sensation, or trouble with coordination.   MS takes several forms, with new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms). 

Interacting boson model<====>50604<====>Interacting boson model The interacting boson model (IBM) is a model in nuclear physics in whichnucleons (protons or neutrons) pair up, essentiallyacting as a single particle with boson properties, withintegral spin of 0, 2 or 4. It is sometimes known as the Interacting boson approximation (IBA).   The IBM1/IBM-I model treats both types of nucleons the same and considers only pairs of nucleons coupled tototal angular momentum 0 and 2, called respectively, s and d bosons.  The IBM2/IBM-II model treats protons and neutrons separately. Both models are restricted to nuclei with even numbers of protons and neutrons.   The model can be used to predict vibrational and rotational modes of non-spherical nuclei. 

Cerebral palsy<====>50605<====>Cerebral palsy  Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of permanent movement disorders that appear in early childhood.   Signs and symptoms vary among people.   Often, symptoms include poor coordination, stiff muscles, weak muscles, and tremors.   There may be problems with sensation, vision, hearing, swallowing, and speaking.   Often babies with cerebral palsy do not roll over, sit, crawl, or walk as early as other children of their age.   Other symptoms may include seizures and problems with thinking or reasoning, either of which occurs in about one third of people with CP. 

Parkinsonism<====>50608<====>Parkinsonism Parkinsonism is a clinical syndrome characterized by tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability.  Parkinsonism is found in Parkinson's disease (after which it is named), however a wide range of other causes may lead to this set of symptoms, including some toxins, a few metabolic diseases, and a handful of neurological conditions other than Parkinson's disease.  About 7% of people with parkinsonism have developed their symptoms following treatment with particular medications.  Side effect of medications, mainly neuroleptic antipsychotics especially the phenothiazines (such as perphenazine and chlorpromazine), thioxanthenes (such as flupenthixol and zuclopenthixol) and butyrophenones (such as haloperidol), piperazines (such as ziprasidone), and rarely, antidepressants. 

Nuclear shell model<====>50609<====>Nuclear shell model In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, the nuclear shell model is a model of the atomic nucleus which uses the Pauli exclusion principle to describe the structure of the nucleus in terms of energy levels.The first shell model was proposed by Dmitry Ivanenko (together with E.  Gapon) in 1932.  The model was developed in 1949 following independent work by several physicists, most notably Eugene Paul Wigner, Maria Goeppert Mayer and J.  Hans D.  Jensen, who shared the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physics for their contributions. The shell model is partly analogous to the atomic shell model which describes the arrangement of electrons in an atom, in that a filled shell results in greater stability. 

Pope Leo XIII<====>50614<====>Pope Leo XIII    Pope Leo XIII ( ; born Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi Pecci;  2 March 1810 – 20 July 1903) was head of the Catholic Church from 20 February 1878 to his death.  He was the oldest pope (reigning until the age of 93), and had the third-longest confirmed pontificate, behind that of Pius IX (his immediate predecessor) and John Paul II.  He is the most recent pontiff to date to take the pontifical name of "Leo" upon being elected to the pontificate. He is well known for his intellectualism and his attempts to define the position of the Catholic Church with regard to modern thinking. 

Scyphozoa<====>50620<====>Scyphozoa  The Scyphozoa are an exclusively marine class of the phylum Cnidaria,  referred to as the true jellyfish (or "true jellies").  It may include the extinct fossil group the Conulariida, whose affinities are uncertain and widely debated. The class name Scyphozoa comes from the Greek word skyphos (σκύφος), denoting a kind of drinking cup and alluding to the cup shape of the organism. Scyphozoans have existed from the earliest Cambrian to the present.  BiologyMost species of Scyphozoa have two life history phases, including the planktonic medusa or jellyfish form, which is most evident in the warm summer months, and an inconspicuous, but longer-lived, bottom-dwelling polyp, which seasonally gives rise to new medusae. 

History of Cyprus<====>50621<====>History of Cyprus  Human habitation of Cyprus dates back to the Paleolithic era.  Cyprus's geographic position has caused Cyprus to be influenced by differing Eastern Mediterranean civilisations over the millennia. Periods of Cyprus's history from 1050 BC have been named according to styles of pottery found as follows:Cypro-Geometric I: 1050-950 BCCypro-Geometric II: 950-850 BCCypro-Geometric III: 850-700 BCCypro-Archaic I: 700-600 BCCypro-Archaic II: 600-475 BCCypro-Classical I: 475-400 BCCypro-Classical II: 400-323 BCPrehistoric Cyprus Cyprus was settled by humans in the Paleolithic period (known as the stone age) who coexisted with various dwarf animal species, such as dwarf elephants (Elephas cypriotes) and pygmy hippos (Hippopotamus minor) well into the Holocene. 

John Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach<====>50622<====>John Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach John Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach (18 October 1654 – 22 March 1686) succeeded his father Albert II as margrave of Ansbach in 1667.   He married his second wife Eleonore Erdmuthe of Saxe-Eisenach on 4 November 1681.  Their daughter Wilhelmine Charlotte Caroline, Margravine of Brandenburg-Ansbach (Caroline of Ansbach) married George II of Great Britain before he became king.  IssueBy Margravine Johanna Elisabeth of Baden-Durlach, daughter of Frederick VI, Margrave of Baden-Durlach, and his wife Christina Magdalena of the Palatinate-Zweibrücken:Margrave Leopold Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach (29 May 1674 – 21 August 1676) died in infancy. 

Chmod<====>50623<====>Chmod In Unix-like operating systems,   is the command and system call which may change the access permissions to file system objects (files and directories).  It may also alter special mode flags.  The request is filtered by the umask.  The name is an abbreviation of change mode.  HistoryA  chmod  command first appeared in AT&T Unix version 1. As systems grew in number and types of users, access control lists  were added to many file systems in addition to these most basic modes to increase flexibility. Command syntax chmod [options] mode[,mode] file1 [file2 . 

Conformal map<====>50627<====>Conformal map In mathematics, a conformal map is a function that preserves angles locally.  In the most common case, the function has a domain and an image in the complex plane. More formally, let  U  and  V  be subsets of  \mathbb{C}^n .   A function  f:U\to V  is called conformal (or angle-preserving) at a point  u_0\in U  if it preserves angles between directed curves through  u_0 , as well as preserving orientation (i. e.  mapping a tangent basis to a basis of the same orientation).  Conformal maps preserve both angles and the shapes of infinitesimally small figures, but not necessarily their size or curvature. 

James J. Hill<====>50628<====>James J.  Hill James Jerome Hill (September 16, 1838 – May 29, 1916), was a Canadian-American railroad executive.  He was the chief executive officer of a family of lines headed by the Great Northern Railway, which served a substantial area of the Upper Midwest, the northern Great Plains, and Pacific Northwest.  Because of the size of this region and the economic dominance exerted by the Hill lines, Hill became known during his lifetime as "The Empire Builder. "BiographyChildhood and youthHill was born in Eramosa Township, Wellington County, Upper Canada (now Ontario).  A childhood accident with a bow and arrow blinded him in the right eye. 

Ford Madox Ford<====>50631<====>Ford Madox Ford  Ford Madox Ford (born Ford Hermann Hueffer (   );  17 December 1873 – 26 June 1939) was an English novelist, poet, critic and editor whose journals, The English Review and The Transatlantic Review, were instrumental in the development of early 20th-century English literature. Ford is now remembered for his novels The Good Soldier (1915), the Parade's End tetralogy (1924–28) and The Fifth Queen trilogy (1906–08).  The Good Soldier is frequently included among the great literature of the 20th century, including the Modern Library 100 Best Novels,  The Observer′s "100 Greatest Novels of All Time",  and The Guardian′s "1000 novels everyone must read". 

Sequoiadendron giganteum<====>50637<====>Sequoiadendron giganteum   Sequoiadendron giganteum (giant sequoia; also known as giant redwood, Sierra redwood, Sierran redwood, Wellingtonia or simply Big Tree a nickname used by John Muir ) is the sole living species in the genus Sequoiadendron, and one of three species of coniferous trees known as redwoods, classified in the family Cupressaceae in the subfamily Sequoioideae, together with Sequoia sempervirens (coast redwood) and Metasequoia glyptostroboides (dawn redwood).  The common use of the name sequoia generally refers to Sequoiadendron giganteum, which occurs naturally only in groves on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. The etymology of the genus name has been presumed initially in The Yosemite Book by Josiah Whitney in 1868    to be in honor of Sequoyah (1767–1843), who was the inventor of the Cherokee syllabary. 

Texas Longhorn<====>50640<====>Texas Longhorn  The Texas Longhorn is a breed of cattle known for its characteristic horns, which can extend to over    tip to tip for bulls, and   tip to tip for steers and exceptional cows.  They are descendants of the first cattle in the New World, brought by Christopher Columbus and the Spanish colonists, and have  a high drought-stress tolerance.  Texas Longhorns are known for their diverse coloring, and can be any color or mix of colors, but dark red and white color mixes are the most dominant. Registries for the breed include the Texas Longhorn Breeders Association of America, founded in 1964 by the Kerr County rancher Charles Schreiner, III; the International Texas Longhorn Association, and the Cattlemen's Texas Longhorn Registry. 

Home economics<====>50649<====>Home economicsHome economics, domestic science or home science is a field of study that deals with the economics and management of the home, family and community.   It deals with the relationship between individuals, families, communities, and the environment in which they live. NameFamily and consumer science was previously known in the United States as home economics, often abbreviated "home ec" or "HE".  In 1994, various organizations, including the American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences, adopted the new term "family and consumer science" to reflect the fact that the field covers aspects outside of home life and wellness. 

Astronomy<====>50650<====>Astronomy    Astronomy (from  ) is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena.  It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution.  Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; the phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation.  More generally, all phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy.  A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole.  Astronomy is one of the oldest of the natural sciences. 

Uniform convergence<====>50652<====>Uniform convergenceIn the mathematical field of analysis, uniform convergence is a type of convergence stronger than pointwise convergence.  A sequence of functions  (f_n)  converges uniformly to a limiting function  f  on a set (for which a distance function is well-defined, aka metric space)  E  if, given any arbitrarily small positive number  \epsilon , an  N  can be found such that each of the functions  f_N, f_{N+1},f_{N+2},\ldots  differ from  f  by no more than  \epsilon  at every point  x  in  E . 

Norman Bates<====>50662<====>Norman Bates   Norman Bates is a fictional character created by Robert Bloch as the main antagonist in his 1959 novel Psycho, and portrayed by Anthony Perkins in the 1960 version of Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchcock and the Psycho franchise.  He is also portrayed by Vince Vaughn in the 1998 version of Psycho, and by Freddie Highmore in the television series Bates Motel (2013 - 2017) which retells the Psycho story over the years prior to the events of the novel and film.   Unlike the franchise produced by Universal Studios, Norman is not the principal antagonist in Bloch's subsequent novels and is succeeded by copycat killers who assume Norman's identity after his death in 1982's Psycho II. 

Frederick, Prince of Wales<====>50666<====>Frederick, Prince of Wales  Frederick, Prince of Wales, KG (1 February 1707 – 31 March 1751) was heir apparent to the British throne from 1727 until his death.  He was the eldest but estranged son of King George II and Caroline of Ansbach, as well as the father of King George III. Under the Act of Settlement passed by the English Parliament in 1701, Frederick was born fourth in the line of succession to the British throne, after his great-grandmother, paternal grandfather and father.  He moved to Great Britain following the accession of his father, and was created Prince of Wales. 

Marcy Playground<====>50670<====>Marcy Playground  Marcy Playground is an American alternative rock band consisting of three members: John Wozniak (lead vocals, guitar), Dylan Keefe (bass), and Shlomi Lavie (drums).  The band is best known for their 1997 hit "Sex and Candy". HistoryEarly yearsThe band is named after the Marcy Open grade school in Minneapolis, which is the alternative school John Wozniak attended.   He chose the name because many of his songs were inspired by his childhood.  Marcy Playground emerged in the late 1990s.  Influences include David Bowie, Paul Simon, Neil Young, Van Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd, Nirvana, Wham! and the Beatles. 

Kill Rock Stars<====>50674<====>Kill Rock Stars  Kill Rock Stars is an independent record label founded in 1991 by Slim Moon and Tinuviel Sampson,    and based in both Olympia, Washington and Portland, Oregon.  The label has released a variety of work in different genres, making it difficult to pigeonhole as having any one unified artistic mission or sound.  However, the label initially showed a commitment towards underground punk bands and to representing artists in the Olympia area music scene.   Overall, the political sensibilities of the label can be said to be left-wing, feminist, and anti-war. HistorySampson and Moon initially started the label because, in Moon's words, "I just wanted to put out my friends’ records because nobody was putting out my friends’ records. 

Laser printing<====>50677<====>Laser printing  Laser printing  is an electrostatic digital printing process.  It produces high-quality text and graphics (and moderate-quality photographs) by repeatedly passing a laser beam back and forth over a negatively charged cylinder called a "drum" to define a differentially charged image.   The drum then selectively collects electrically charged powdered ink (toner), and transfers the image to paper, which is then heated in order to permanently fuse the text and/or imagery.  As with digital photocopiers, laser printers employ a xerographic printing process.  However, laser printing differs from analog photocopiers in that the image is produced by the direct scanning of the medium across the printer's photoreceptor. 

Matthias Jakob Schleiden<====>50678<====>Matthias Jakob Schleiden Matthias Jakob Schleiden (5 April 1804  23 June 1881) was a German botanist and co-founder of cell theory, along with Theodor Schwann and Rudolf Virchow. Born in Hamburg, Schleiden was educated at the University of Jena, then practiced law in Heidelberg, but soon developed his love for botany into a full-time pursuit.   Schleiden preferred to study plant structure under the microscope.   While a professor of botany at the University of Jena, he wrote Contributions to our Knowledge of Phytogenesis (1838), in which he stated that all parts of the plant organism are composed of cells. 

Dot matrix printing<====>50679<====>Dot matrix printing Dot matrix printing is the process of computer printing from a collection of dot matrix data to a device, which can be one of:Impact dot matrix printers, what The New York Times calls "dot-matrix impact printers. "   non-impact dot matrix printers, such as inkjet, thermal, or laser printers. Dot matrix (impact) printing is a type of computer printing which uses a print head that moves back-and-forth, or in an up-and-down motion, on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like the print mechanism on a typewriter.  However, unlike a typewriter or daisy wheel printer, letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced. 

Funicular<====>50680<====>Funicular   A funicular ( ), also known as an inclined plane or cliff railway, is a type of cable railway in which a cable attached to a pair of tram-like vehicles on rails moves them up and down a steep slope, the ascending and descending vehicles counterbalancing each other.  Funiculars of one type or another have existed for hundreds of years, and they continue to be used for moving both passengers and goods.  The name "funicular" itself is derived from the Latin word  , the diminutive of  , which translates as "rope". HistoryThe oldest funicular is the Reisszug, a private line providing goods access to Hohensalzburg Castle at Salzburg in Austria. 

Line matrix printer<====>50682<====>Line matrix printer A line matrix printer is a computer printer that is a compromise between a line printer and a dot matrix printer.   Basically, it prints a page-wide line of dots.  It builds up a line of text by printing lines of dots. ApplicationsLine matrix printers are used for high-speed printing applications in industries such as manufacturing, banking, supply chain and back office environments.  In these high-volume printing industries, line matrix printers are used to produce invoices, bank statements, product shipment and transportation documentation as well as product compliance labels. Line matrix printers can print text, bar codes and graphics. 

Page printer<====>50683<====>Page printer A page printer is a computer printer which processes and prints a whole page at a time, as opposed to printers which print one line or character at a time such as line printers and dot-matrix printers.  Page printers are often all incorrectly termed “laser printers”—although virtually all laser printers are page printers, other page printing technologies also exist. ComponentsThe components of a page printer are:A print engine, "the unit within a printer that does the actual printing. "  For example, in a laser printer this would consist of the laser and drum and the mechanical paper feeds. 

Pulled rickshaw<====>50684<====>Pulled rickshaw A  pulled rickshaw (or ricksha) is a mode of human-powered transport by which a runner draws a two-wheeled cart which seats one or two people. In recent times the use of human-powered rickshaws has been discouraged or outlawed in many countries due to concern for the welfare of rickshaw workers.   Pulled rickshaws have been replaced mainly by cycle rickshaw and auto rickshaws. Overview Rickshaws are commonly believed to have been invented in Japan in the 1860s, at the beginning of a rapid period of technical advancement.   In the 19th century, rickshaw pulling became an inexpensive, popular mode of transportation across Asia. 

Edmund Clerihew Bentley<====>50685<====>Edmund Clerihew BentleyE.  C.  Bentley (full name Edmund Clerihew Bentley; 10 July 1875 30 March 1956) was a popular English novelist and humorist, and inventor of the clerihew, an irregular form of humorous verse on biographical topics.  One of the best known is this (1905):Sir Christopher WrenSaid, "I am going to dine with some men. If anyone callsSay I am designing St.  Paul's.

Inkjet printing<====>50687<====>Inkjet printing  Inkjet printing is a type of computer printing that recreates a digital image by propelling droplets of ink onto paper, plastic, or other substrates.   Inkjet printers are the most commonly used type of printer,  and range from small inexpensive consumer models to expensive professional machines. The concept of inkjet printing originated in the 20th century, and the technology was first extensively developed in the early 1950s.  Starting in the late 1970s, inkjet printers that could reproduce digital images generated by computers were developed, mainly by Epson, Hewlett-Packard (HP), and Canon.  In the worldwide consumer market, four manufacturers account for the majority of inkjet printer sales: Canon, HP, Epson, and Brother. 

Pseudotsuga macrocarpa<====>50690<====>Pseudotsuga macrocarpa Pseudotsuga macrocarpa, commonly called the bigcone spruce or bigcone Douglas-fir, is an evergreen conifer native to the mountains of southern California,   It is notable for having the largest (by far) cones in its Pseudotsuga genus, hence the name. The tree occurs from the San Rafael Mountains in central Santa Barbara County and the Tehachapi Mountains of southwestern Kern County, south through the Transverse Ranges, to the Cuyamaca Mountains in San Diego County.  The tree is shade-tolerant and prefers to grow on slopes. NamePseudotsuga macrocarpa is a Douglas-fir.  The name "bigcone spruce", though confusing as it is not a spruce species, is often still used,   and occurs in place names. 

Douglas fir<====>50691<====>Douglas fir   Pseudotsuga menziesii, commonly known as Douglas fir, Douglas-fir and Oregon pine, is an evergreen conifer species native to western North America.  One variety, the coast Douglas fir, grows along the Pacific Ocean from central British Columbia south to central California.  A second variety, the Rocky Mountain Douglas fir, grows in the Rocky Mountains from British Columbia south to Mexico.  The tree is dominant in western Washington and Oregon.  It is extensively used for timber, worldwide. NamingThe common name honors David Douglas, a Scottish botanist and collector who first reported the extraordinary nature and potential of the species. 

Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca<====>50692<====>Pseudotsuga menziesii var.  glaucaDISPLAYTITLE Pseudotsuga menziesii var.  glauca, or Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, is an evergreen conifer native to the interior mountainous regions of western North America, from central British Columbia and southwest Alberta in Canada southward through the United States to the far north of Mexico.   The range is continuous in the northern Rocky Mountains south to eastern Washington, eastern Oregon, Idaho, western and south-central Montana and western Wyoming, but becomes discontinuous further south, confined to "sky islands" on the higher mountains in Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico, with only very isolated small populations in eastern Nevada, westernmost Texas, and northern Mexico. 

Mortimer Wheeler<====>50693<====>Mortimer Wheeler    Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler   (10 September 1890 – 22 July 1976) was a British archaeologist and officer in the British Army.  Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the National Museum of Wales and London Museum, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and the founder and Honorary Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, further writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects. Born in Glasgow to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in Yorkshire before relocating to London in his teenage years.  After studying Classics at University College London (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specializing in the Romano-British period. 

Augustus Pitt Rivers<====>50695<====>Augustus Pitt Rivers  Augustus Henry Lane-Fox Pitt Rivers (14 April 1827 – 4 May 1900) was an English officer in the British Army, ethnologist, and archaeologist.   He was noted for innovations in archaeological methodology, and in the museum display of archaeological and ethnological collections.  His international collection of about 22,000 objects was the founding collection of the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford   while his collection of English archaeology from the area around Stonehenge forms the basis of the collection at The Salisbury Museum in Wiltshire.   Throughout most of his life he used the surname Lane Fox, under which his early archaeological reports are published. 

Environmental engineering<====>50702<====>Environmental engineering Environmental engineering is the branch of engineering concerned with the application of scientific and engineering principles for protection of human populations from the effects of adverse environmental factors; protection of environments, both local and global, from  potentially deleterious effects of natural and human activities; and improvement of environmental quality.  Environmental engineering can also be described as a branch of applied science and technology that addresses the issues of energy preservation, protection of assets and control of waste from human and animal activities.  Furthermore, it is concerned with finding plausible solutions in the field of public health, such as waterborne diseases, implementing laws which promote adequate sanitation in urban, rural and recreational areas. 

Construction engineering<====>50705<====>Construction engineering Construction Engineering is a professional discipline that deals with the designing, planning, construction, and management of infrastructures such as roads, tunnels, bridges, airports, railroads, facilities, buildings, dams, utilities and other projects.  Construction Engineering is considered a professional sub-practice area of civil engineering or architectural engineering. Construction technology is a related field that deals more with the practical aspects of projects.  Construction technologists or construction technicians learn some of the design aspects similar to civil engineers and some of the project site management aspects similar to construction managers.  These technicians are unique such that they are a cross between civil engineers and construction managers.

It began on April 7, 1979 as Mobile Suit Gundam, a TV series that defined the real robot or "mecha" anime genre by featuring giant robots in a militaristic setting.  The popularity of the series and its merchandise spawned a franchise that includes television series, OVAs, films, manga, novels and video games. In 2014 the Gundam franchise generated ¥80 billion per year, Bandai Namco Fiscal Year 2014 Financial Statement  ¥18. 

Middle English<====>50711<====>Middle English Middle English (ME) is collectively the varieties of the English language spoken after the Norman Conquest (1066) until the late 15th century; scholarly opinion varies but the Oxford English Dictionary specifies the period of 1150 to 1500.This stage of the development of the English language roughly followed the High to the Late Middle Ages. Middle English developed out of Late Old English, seeing many dramatic changes in its grammar, pronunciation and orthography.  Writing customs during Middle English times varied widely, but by the end of the period, about 1470, aided by the invention of the printing press, a standard based on the London dialect (Chancery Standard) had become established. 

Regional science<====>50712<====>Regional science Regional science is a field of the social sciences concerned with analytical approaches to problems that are specifically urban, rural, or regional.  Topics in regional science include, but are not limited to location theory or spatial economics, location modeling, transportation, migration analysis, land use and urban development, interindustry analysis, environmental and ecological analysis, resource management, urban and regional policy analysis, geographical information systems, and spatial data analysis.  In the broadest sense, any social science analysis that has a spatial dimension is embraced by regional scientists. OriginsRegional science was founded in the late 1940s when some economists began to become dissatisfied with the low level of regional economic analysis and felt an urge to upgrade it. 

Zygnematales<====>50713<====>Zygnematales The Zygnematales (  (zygós) and νῆμα (nḗma) (nom. ), νήματος (nḗmatos) (gen. )), also called the Conjugatales, are an order of green algae,    comprising several thousand different species in two families.  The larger family Zygnemataceae, with well-known genera such as Zygnema and Spirogyra, includes members that grow as unbranched filaments, which grow longer through normal cell division.  The smaller family Mesotaeniaceae includes the saccoderm "desmids", a group of unicellular species that were formerly classified with the "true" desmids.  Most members of both families live in freshwater, and form an important component of the algal scum that grows on or near plants, rocks, and various debris. 

Sinclair Lewis<====>50714<====>Sinclair Lewis   Harry Sinclair Lewis (February 7, 1885 – January 10, 1951) was an American novelist, short-story writer, and playwright.  In 1930, he became the first writer from the United States to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, which was awarded "for his vigorous and graphic art of description and his ability to create, with wit and humor, new types of characters. " His works are known for their insightful and critical views of American capitalism and materialism between the wars.   He is also respected for his strong characterizations of modern working women.  H. 

Piracy<====>50715<====>PiracyPiracy is an act of robbery or criminal violence by ship or boat-borne attackers upon another ship or a coastal area, typically with the goal of stealing cargo and other valuable items or properties.  Those who engage in acts of piracy are called pirates.  The earliest documented instances of piracy were in the 14th century BC, when the Sea Peoples, a group of ocean raiders, attacked the ships of the Aegean and Mediterranean civilizations.  Narrow channels which funnel shipping into predictable routes have long created opportunities for piracy,  as well as for privateering and commerce raiding. 

Quantum harmonic oscillator<====>50719<====>Quantum harmonic oscillator  The quantum harmonic oscillator is the quantum-mechanical analog of the classical harmonic oscillator.    Because an arbitrary potential can usually be approximated as a harmonic potential at the vicinity of a stable equilibrium point,  it is one of the most important model systems in quantum mechanics.  Furthermore, it is one of the few quantum-mechanical systems for which an exact, analytical solution is known. One-dimensional harmonic oscillatorHamiltonian and energy eigenstatesThe Hamiltonian of the particle is: \hat H = \frac{{\hat p}^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} k {\hat x}^2 = \frac{{\hat p}^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 {\hat x}^2\, , where   is the particle's mass,   is the force constant,  \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}  is the angular frequency of the oscillator,  \hat{x}   is the position operator (given by  ), and    \hat{p}   is the momentum operator (given by  \hat p = - i \hbar {\partial \over \partial x} \, ). 

Buccaneer<====>50720<====>Buccaneer  Buccaneers  were a kind of privateer or pirate peculiar to the Caribbean Sea during the 17th and 18th centuries. Originally the name applied to the landless hunters of wild boars and cattle in the largely uninhabited areas of Tortuga and Hispaniola.  The meat they caught was smoked over a slow fire in little huts the French called boucanes to make viande boucanée – jerked meat or jerky – which they sold to the corsairs that preyed on the shipping and settlements (largely Spanish) of the Caribbean.  Eventually the term was applied to the corsairs and (later) privateers themselves, also known as the Brethren of the Coast. 

Sully Prudhomme<====>50722<====>Sully Prudhomme   René François Armand (Sully) Prudhomme ( ; 16 March 1839 – 6 September 1907) was a French poet and essayist.  He was the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901. Born in Paris, Prudhomme originally studied to be an engineer, but turned to philosophy and later to poetry; he declared it as his intention to create scientific poetry for modern times.  In character sincere and melancholic, he was linked to the Parnassus school, although, at the same time, his work displays characteristics of its own. Early lifePrudhomme was born to a French shopkeeper. 

Convergence of random variables<====>50723<====>Convergence of random variables In probability theory, there exist several different notions of convergence of random variables.   The convergence of sequences of random variables to some limit random variable is an important concept in probability theory, and its applications to statistics and stochastic processes.  The same concepts are known in more general mathematics as stochastic convergence and they formalize the idea that a sequence of essentially random or unpredictable events can sometimes be expected to settle down into a behaviour that is essentially unchanging when items far enough into the sequence are studied.  The different possible notions of convergence relate to how such a behaviour can be characterised: two readily understood behaviours are that the sequence eventually takes a constant value, and that values in the sequence continue to change but can be described by an unchanging probability distribution. 

Weak convergence<====>50725<====>Weak convergenceIn mathematics, weak convergence may refer to: Weak convergence of random variables of a probability distributionWeak convergence of measures, of a sequence of probability measuresWeak convergence (Hilbert space) of a sequence in a Hilbert spacemore generally, convergence in weak topology in a Banach space or a topological vector space 

Extreme value theory<====>50732<====>Extreme value theory  Extreme value theory or extreme value analysis (EVA)  is a branch of statistics dealing with the extreme deviations from the median of probability distributions.  It seeks to assess, from a given ordered sample of a given random variable, the probability of events that are more extreme than any previously observed.  Extreme value analysis is widely used in many disciplines, such as structural engineering, finance, earth sciences, traffic prediction, and geological engineering.  For example, EVA might be used in the field of hydrology to estimate the probability of an unusually large flooding event, such as the 100-year flood. 

Prabuty<====>50735<====>Prabuty  Prabuty   ( ) is a town in Kwidzyn County within the Pomeranian Voivodeship of northern Poland.  In the period between 1975–98 Prabuty were part of the Elbląg Voivodeship. Geographical locationPrabuty is located approximately   18 kilometers east of Kwidzyn, 100 kilometers south-east of Gdańsk, 100 kilometers west of Olsztyn and 133 kilometers south-west of Kaliningrad. Prabuty is an important rail junction on the Warszawa–Gdynia railway. HistoryIn 1236, the Teutonic Knights under Henry III, Margrave of Meissen, destroyed an Old Prussian fortress between the lakes Sorgensee  (jez.  Dzierzgon) and Liwieniec.  The town was first mentioned in 1250 as Riesenburg. 

Iaidō<====>50739<====>Iaidō, abbreviated with  ,  is a Japanese martial art that emphasizes being aware and capable of quickly drawing the sword and responding to a sudden attack.  Christensen, Karen and Allen Guttmann et. al (2001) International Encyclopedia of Women and Sports: H-R.  Macmillan Reference USA, Page 553.  Iaido is associated with the smooth, controlled movements of drawing the sword from its scabbard (or saya), striking or cutting an opponent, removing blood from the blade, and then replacing the sword in the scabbard.  John Nauright, Charles Parrish, edited (2012) Sports Around the World: History, Culture, and Practice. 

Daishō<====>50740<====>Daishō The  —literally "big-little" —is a Japanese term for a matched pair of traditionally made Japanese swords (nihonto) worn by the samurai class in feudal Japan. DescriptionThe etymology of the word daishō becomes apparent when the terms daitō, meaning long sword, and shōtō, meaning short sword, are used; daitō + shōtō = daishō.   A daishō is typically depicted as a katana and wakizashi mounted in matching koshirae but originally the daishō was the wearing of any long and short uchigatana together.   The katana/wakizashi pairing is not the only daishō combination as generally any longer sword paired with a tantō is considered to be a daishō. 

Return of the Jedi<====>50744<====>Return of the Jedi   Return of the Jedi (also known as Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi)   is a 1983 American epic space opera film directed by Richard Marquand.  The screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas was from a story by Lucas, who was also the executive producer.  It is the third installment in the original Star Wars trilogy and the first film to use THX technology.  The film is set one year after The Empire Strikes Back  and was produced by Howard Kazanjian for Lucasfilm Ltd.  The film stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew and Frank Oz. 

Paul Simon<====>50745<====>Paul Simon   Paul Frederic Simon (born October 13, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter and actor.  Simon's musical career has spanned seven decades, with his fame and commercial success beginning as half of the duo Simon & Garfunkel, which was formed in 1964 with Art Garfunkel.  Simon was responsible for writing nearly all of the pair's songs, including three that reached No.  1 on the U. S.  singles charts: "The Sound of Silence", "Mrs.  Robinson", and "Bridge over Troubled Water".  The duo split up in 1970 at the height of their popularity and Simon began a successful solo career as a guitarist and singer-songwriter, recording three highly acclaimed albums over the next five years. 

Paris Métro<====>50748<====>Paris Métro  The Paris Métro or Métropolitain ( ) is a rapid transit system in the Paris Metropolitan Area.  A symbol of the city, it is noted for its density within the city limits and its uniform architecture, influenced by Art Nouveau.  It is mostly underground and   long.It has 303 stations,    of which 62 have transfers between lines.   There are 16 lines, numbered 1 to 14 with two lines, 3bis and 7bis, which are named because they started out as branches of lines 3 and 7; later they officially became separate lines; the Metro is still numbered as if these lines were absent. 

Carmen Miranda<====>50758<====>Carmen Miranda   Carmen Miranda GCIH, OMC   , born Maria do Carmo Miranda da Cunha (February 9, 1909 – August 5, 1955), was a Portuguese-born Brazilian samba singer, dancer, Broadway actress, and film star who was popular from the 1930s to the 1950s.  Nicknamed "The Brazilian Bombshell",   Miranda is noted for her signature fruit hat outfit she wore in her American films.  As a young woman, she designed hats in a boutique before recording her first album with composer Josué de Barros in 1929.  Miranda's 1930 recording of "Taí" ("Pra Você Gostar de Mim"), written by Joubert de Carvalho, catapulted her to stardom in Brazil as the foremost interpreter of samba. 

Elbe<====>50759<====>Elbe   The Elbe ( ;    ;    ; Low German: Elv) is one of the major rivers of Central Europe.  It rises in the Krkonoše Mountains of the northern Czech Republic before traversing much of Bohemia (Czech Republic), then Germany and flowing into the North Sea at Cuxhaven,   northwest of Hamburg.  Its total length is  .    The Elbe's major tributaries include the rivers Vltava, Saale, Havel, Mulde, Schwarze Elster, and Ohře.  The Elbe river basin, comprising the Elbe and its tributaries, has a catchment area of  , the fourth largest in Europe. 

Privateer<====>50767<====>Privateer A privateer was a private person or ship that engaged in maritime warfare under a commission of war.   The commission, also known as a letter of marque, empowered the person to carry on all forms of hostility permissible at sea by the usages of war, including attacking foreign vessels during wartime and taking them as prizes.  Captured ships were subject to condemnation and sale under prize law, with the proceeds divided between the privateer sponsors, shipowners, captains and crew.  A percentage share usually went to the issuer of the commission.  Since robbery under arms was common to seaborne trade, all merchant ships were already armed. 

People mover<====>50768<====>People mover   A people mover or automated people mover (APM) is a type of small scale automated guideway transit system.  The term is generally used only to describe systems serving relatively small areas such as airports, downtown districts or theme parks. The term was originally applied to three different systems, developed roughly at the same time.  One was Skybus, an automated mass transit system prototyped by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation beginning in 1964.  The second, alternately called the People Mover and Minirail, opened in Montreal at Expo 67.  Finally the last, called PeopleMover or WEDway PeopleMover, was an attraction that was originally presented by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and that opened at Disneyland in 1967. 

Ferry<====>50771<====>Ferry    A ferry is a merchant vessel used to carry passengers, and sometimes vehicles and cargo as well, across a body of water.   Most ferries operate regular return services.  A passenger ferry with many stops, such as in Venice, Italy, is sometimes called a water bus or water taxi. Ferries form a part of the public transport systems of many waterside cities and islands, allowing direct transit between points at a capital cost much lower than bridges or tunnels.  However, ship connections of much larger distances (such as over long distances in water bodies like the Mediterranean Sea) may also be called ferry services, especially if they carry vehicles. 

Jar Jar Binks<====>50778<====>Jar Jar Binks   Jar Jar Binks is a fictional character from the Star Wars saga created by George Lucas.  A major character in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, he also has a smaller role in Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and a one-line cameo in Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, as well as a role in the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars.  The first lead computer generated character of the franchise, he has been portrayed by Ahmed Best in most of his appearances. Jar Jar's primary role in Episode I was to provide comic relief for the audience.

Victimless crime<====>50803<====>Victimless crime A victimless crime is an illegal act that typically either directly involves only the perpetrator, or occurs between consenting adults; because it is consensual in nature, there is arguably no true victim.  Examples of these types of crimes include possession of illegal contraband, and atypical sexual behavior.   In most countries, current victimless crimes include recreational drug use, while some also include prostitution.  However, there is controversy surrounding this.   Edwin Schur and Hugo Bedau state in their book Victimless Crimes: Two Sides of a Controversy that "some of these laws produce secondary crime, and all create new 'criminals,' many of whom are otherwise law-abiding citizens and people in authority. 

Consensual crime<====>50804<====>Consensual crime  A consensual crime is a public-order crime that involves more than one participant, all of whom give their consent as willing participants in an activity that is unlawful.  Legislative bodies and interest groups sometimes rationalize the criminalization of consensual activity because they feel it offends cultural norms, or because one of the parties to the activity is considered a "victim" despite their informed consent.  Consensual crimes are sometimes described as crimes in which the victim is the state, the judicial system, or society at large and so affect the general (sometimes ideological or cultural) interests of the system, such as common sexual morality.

White Australia policy<====>50806<====>White Australia policy  The term White Australia policy comprises various historical policies that effectively barred people of non-European descent from immigrating to Australia.  There was never any specific policy titled as such, but the term was invented later to encapsulate a collection of policies that were designed to exclude people from Asia (particularly China) and the Pacific Islands (particularly Melanesia) from immigrating to Australia.  These policies were progressively dismantled between 1949 and 1973.    Competition in the gold fields between British and Chinese miners, and labour union opposition to the importation of Pacific Islanders into the sugar plantations of Queensland, reinforced the demand to eliminate or minimize low wage immigration from Asia and the Pacific Islands.

Stored energy printer<====>50863<====>Stored energy printer A stored energy printer is a computer printer that uses the energy stored in a spring or magnetic field to push a hammer through a ribbon to print a dot.  As compared to dot matrix printers that print a single column of dots at a time, this printer generally creates an entire line of dots at a time.  Therefore, it is also known as a line matrix printer.  This technology produces premium impact printers that print for millions to billions of dots per hammer.  The advantage of this technology is that it has the lowest known cost of ownership: ink is transferred by conventional typewriter-style ribbons.

It is a specialized type of hand plane with a broad base and a narrow blade that projects well beyond its base plate (giving it the nickname old woman's tooth).  The power tool form of router with an electric-motor-driven spindle is now the more common form. 

Feather<====>50873<====>Feather   Feathers are epidermal growths that form the distinctive outer covering, or plumage, on birds and other, extinct species' of dinosaurs.  They are considered the most complex integumentary structures found in vertebrates  and a premier example of a complex evolutionary novelty.They are among the characteristics that distinguish the extant birds from other living groups.    Although feathers cover most parts of the body of birds, they arise only from certain well-defined tracts on the skin.  They aid in flight, thermal insulation, and waterproofing. 

Geography of Madagascar<====>50874<====>Geography of Madagascar  Madagascar is a large island in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of southern Africa, east of Mozambique.

History of Madagascar<====>50875<====>History of Madagascar The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly by the early isolation of the landmass from the ancient supercontinents containing Africa and India, and by the island's late colonization by human settlers arriving in outrigger canoes from the Sunda islands between 200 BC and 500 AD.  These two factors facilitated the evolution and survival of thousands of endemic plant and animal species, some of which have gone extinct or are currently threatened with extinction due to the pressures of a growing human population.  Over the past two thousand years the island has received waves of settlers of diverse origins including Austronesian, Bantu, Arab, South Asian, Chinese and European populations. 

Demographics of Madagascar<====>50876<====>Demographics of MadagascarThis article is about the demographic features of the population of Madagascar, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population. Madagascar's population is predominantly of mixed Austronesian and East African origin. Population The problem with population estimation in Madagascar is that data is very old and limited.   The last population census was carried out in 1993, after an initial 1975 census.   There was an attempt at a census in 2009, but this attempt ultimately failed due to political instability.   Therefore, the demographic situation is inferred but reliability of any estimates from any source has a large margin of error.

Political history Madagascar's first President, Philibert Tsiranana, was elected when his Social Democratic Party gained power at independence in 1960 and was reelected without opposition in March 1972. 

Economy of Madagascar<====>50878<====>Economy of Madagascar   The economy of Madagascar is a market economy and is supported by Madagascar's well-established agricultural industry and emerging tourism, textile and mining industries.  Malagasy agriculture produces tropical staple crops such as rice and cassava, as well as cash crops such as vanilla and coffee.  Madagascar's wealth of natural resources   supports its sizable mining industry.  Additionally, Madagascar's status as a developing nation exempts Malagasy exports from customs protocol in some areas, notably the United States and European Union.  These exemptions have supported the growth of the Malagasy textile industry.  Despite Madagascar's natural resources and developing industries, the 2009 Malagasy political crisis—considered by the international community to be an illegal coup   —deterred foreign investments in Madagascar and caused the Malagasy economy to decline. 

Telecommunications in Madagascar<====>50879<====>Telecommunications in Madagascar Telecommunications in Madagascar include newspapers, radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet. Widespread poverty and illiteracy severely limit the penetration of television, print media, and the Internet, making radio by far the most important communications medium in the country.  Newspapers L'Express de Madagascar, private daily.  Midi Madagasikara, private daily.  Madagascar Tribune, private daily.  La Gazette de la Grande Ile, private daily.  Lakroa (Cross), Catholic weekly.  Press freedomWhile the constitution provides for freedom of the press, the ability of the press to criticize the regime is severely limited.  In particular the absence of a communications code protecting press freedoms allows authorities to prosecute journalists under libel law and the criminal code whenever the content of their reporting offends the facto regime.

Military of Madagascar<====>50881<====>Military of Madagascar The Military of Madagascar is made up of the People's Armed Forces and the National Gendarmerie.  The IISS detailed the armed forces in 2012 as including an Army of 12,500+, a Navy of 500, and a 500-strong Air Force.    An alternate report (seemingly from CIA World Factbook data) describes the People's Armed Forces as consisting of the Intervention Force, Development Force, and Aeronaval Force, which is the navy and air force.    The armed forces were involved in the 2009 Malagasy political crisis.  During World War II, Malagasy troops fought in France, Morocco, and Syria. 

United Nations Commission on Human Rights<====>50883<====>United Nations Commission on Human Rights The United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) was a functional commission within the overall framework of the United Nations from 1946 until it was replaced by the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2006.  It was a subsidiary body of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), and was also assisted in its work by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNOHCHR).  It was the UN's principal mechanism and international forum concerned with the promotion and protection of human rights. On 15 March 2006, the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to replace UNCHR with the UN Human Rights Council. 

Chelicerata<====>50884<====>Chelicerata  The subphylum Chelicerata (  or  ; New Latin, from French chélicère, from Greek khēlē "claw, chela" and kéras "horn") constitutes one of the major subdivisions of the phylum Arthropoda.  It contains the horseshoe crabs, sea spiders, and arachnids (including scorpions and spiders). The chelicerata originated as marine animals, possibly in the Cambrian period, but the first confirmed chelicerate fossils, eurypterids, date from   in the Late Ordovician period.  The surviving marine species include the four species of xiphosurans (horseshoe crabs), and possibly the 1,300 species of pycnogonids (sea spiders), if the latter are indeed chelicerates. 

Space station<====>50896<====>Space station A space station, also known as an orbital station or an orbital space station, is a spacecraft capable of supporting crewmembers, which is designed to remain in space (most commonly as an artificial satellite in low Earth orbit) for an extended period of time and for other spacecraft to dock.  A space station is distinguished from other spacecraft used for human spaceflight by lack of major propulsion or landing systems.  Instead, other vehicles transport people and cargo to and from the station.   , three space stations are in orbit: the International Space Station, which is permanently inhabited, China's Tiangong-1 (defunct) and Tiangong-2 (launched 15 September 2016, not permanently inhabited). 

French grammar<====>50897<====>French grammar  French grammar is the grammar of the French language, which in many respects is quite similar to that of the other Romance languages. French is a moderately inflected language.  Nouns and most pronouns are inflected for number (singular or plural, though in most nouns the plural is pronounced the same as the singular even if spelt differently); adjectives, for number and gender (masculine or feminine) of their nouns; personal pronouns and a few other pronouns, for person, number, gender, and case; and verbs, for tense, aspect, mood, and the person and number of their subjects.  Case is primarily marked using word order and prepositions, while certain verb features are marked using auxiliary verbs. 

Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex<====>50899<====>Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex    Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, KG, PC ( ; 10 November 1565  – 25 February 1601), was an English nobleman and a favourite of Elizabeth I.  Politically ambitious, and a committed general, he was placed under house arrest following a poor campaign in Ireland during the Nine Years' War in 1599.  In 1601, he led an abortive coup d'état against the government and was executed for treason. Early lifeEssex was born on 10 November 1565 at Netherwood near Bromyard, in Herefordshire, the son of Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex, and Lettice Knollys. 

Wavelet<====>50903<====>WaveletA wavelet is a wave-like oscillation with an amplitude that begins at zero, increases, and then decreases back to zero.  It can typically be visualized as a "brief oscillation" like one recorded by a seismograph or heart monitor.  Generally, wavelets are intentionally crafted to have specific properties that make them useful for signal processing.  Using a "reverse, shift, multiply and integrate" technique called convolution, wavelets can be combined with known portions of a damaged signal to extract information from the unknown portions. For example, a wavelet could be created to have a frequency of Middle C and a short duration of roughly a 32nd note. 

Haar wavelet<====>50905<====>Haar wavelet In mathematics, the Haar wavelet is a sequence of rescaled "square-shaped" functions which together form a wavelet family or basis.  Wavelet analysis is similar to Fourier analysis in that it allows a target function over an interval to be represented in terms of an orthonormal basis.  The Haar sequence is now recognised as the first known wavelet basis and extensively used as a teaching example. The Haar sequence was proposed in 1909 by Alfréd Haar.   Haar used these functions to give an example of an orthonormal system for the space of square-integrable functions on the unit interval [0, 1]. 

List of Fourier-related transforms<====>50907<====>List of Fourier-related transformsThis is a list of linear transformations of functions related to Fourier analysis.   Such transformations map a function to a set of coefficients of basis functions, where the basis functions are sinusoidal and are therefore strongly localized in the frequency spectrum.   (These transforms are generally designed to be invertible. )  In the case of the Fourier transform, each basis function corresponds to a single frequency component. Continuous transformsApplied to functions of continuous arguments, Fourier-related transforms include:Two-sided Laplace transformMellin transform, another closely related integral transformLaplace transformFourier transform, with special cases:Fourier series When the input function/waveform is periodic, the Fourier transform output is a Dirac comb function, modulated by a discrete sequence of finite-valued coefficients that are complex-valued in general. 

Roger Ebert<====>50908<====>Roger Ebert    Roger Joseph Ebert ( ; June 18, 1942 – April 4, 2013) was an American film critic and historian, journalist, screenwriter, and author.  He was a film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his death in 2013.  In 1975, Ebert became the first film critic to win the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism. Ebert and Chicago Tribune critic Gene Siskel helped popularize nationally televised film reviewing when they co-hosted the PBS show Sneak Previews, followed by several variously named At the Movies programs.  The two verbally sparred and traded humorous barbs while discussing films. 

Basis function<====>50909<====>Basis function In mathematics,  a basis function is an element of a particular basis for a function space.  Every continuous function in the function space can be represented as a linear combination of basis functions, just as every vector in a vector space can be represented as a linear combination of basis vectors. In numerical analysis and approximation theory, basis functions are also called blending functions, because of their use in interpolation: In this application, a mixture of the basis functions provides an interpolating function (with the "blend" depending on the evaluation of the basis functions at the data points). 

Transform coding<====>50914<====>Transform coding Transform coding is a type of data compression for "natural" data like audio signals or photographic images.  The transformation is typically lossless (perfectly reversible) on its own but is used to enable better (more targeted) quantization, which then results in a lower quality copy of the original input (lossy compression). In transform coding, knowledge of the application is used to choose information to discard, thereby lowering its bandwidth.  The remaining information can then be compressed via a variety of methods.  When the output is decoded, the result may not be identical to the original input, but is expected to be close enough for the purpose of the application. 

William Carlos Williams<====>50918<====>William Carlos Williams William Carlos Williams (September 17, 1883 – March 4, 1963) was an American poet closely associated with modernism and imagism. In addition to his writing, Williams had a long career as a physician practicing both pediatrics and general medicine.  He was affiliated with what was then known as Passaic General Hospital in Passaic, New Jersey, where he served as the hospital's chief of pediatrics from 1924 until his death.  The hospital, which is now known as St.  Mary's General Hospital, paid tribute to Williams with a memorial plaque that states "we walk the wards that Williams walked". 

Seamus Heaney<====>50920<====>Seamus Heaney   Seamus Justin Heaney,  MRIA  ( ; 13 April 1939 – 30 August 2013), was an Irish poet, playwright and translator.  He received the 1995 Nobel Prize in Literature.  Obituary: Heaney ‘the most important Irish poet since Yeats’, Irish Times, 30 August 2013.   Seamus Heaney obituary, The Guardian, 30 August 2013.  Born near Castledawson and Toomebridge, Northern Ireland, the family moved to nearby Bellaghy when he was a boy.  Heaney became a lecturer at St.  Joseph's College in Belfast in the early 1960s, after attending Queen's University and began to publish poetry. 

The Crocodile Hunter<====>50928<====>The Crocodile Hunter   The Crocodile Hunter is a wildlife documentary television series that was hosted by Steve Irwin and his wife, Terri.  The show became a popular franchise due to Irwin's unconventional approach to wildlife.  It spawned a number of separate projects, including the feature film The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course and two television spinoffs: Croc Files and The Crocodile Hunter Diaries.  The series was presented on Animal Planet, becoming the network's highest-rated series at the time, and was in international syndication on networks worldwide.  The series aired 78 episodes during five seasons, from 1996 through 2007; with a nearly 11-year run, the series remains to this day, the second longest-running program of any Discovery Communications network, behind MythBusters. 

Light rail<====>50943<====>Light rail  Light rail, light rail transit (LRT), or fast tram is urban public transport using rolling stock similar to a tramway, but operating at a higher capacity, and often on an exclusive right-of-way. There is no standard definition, but in the United States (where the terminology was devised in the 1970s from the engineering term light railway), light rail operates primarily along exclusive rights-of-way and uses either individual tramcars or multiple units coupled to form a train that is lower capacity and lower speed than a long heavy passenger train or metro system.    A few light rail networks tend to have characteristics closer to rapid transit or even commuter rail; some of these heavier rapid transit-like systems are referred to as light metros. 

Swan<====>50952<====>Swan   Swans are birds of the family Anatidae within the genus Cygnus.  The swans' close relatives include the geese and ducks.  Swans are grouped with the closely related geese in the subfamily Anserinae where they form the tribe Cygnini.  Sometimes, they are considered a distinct subfamily, Cygninae.  There are six or seven species of swan in the genus Cygnus; in addition there is another species known as the coscoroba swan, although this species is no longer considered one of the true swans.  Swans usually mate for life, though "divorce" does sometimes occur, particularly following nesting failure, and if a mate dies, the remaining swan will take up with another. 

Egyptian hieroglyphs<====>50953<====>Egyptian hieroglyphs   Egyptian hieroglyphs (   ) were the formal writing system used in Ancient Egypt.  It combined logographic, syllabic and alphabetic elements, with a total of some 1,000 distinct characters.  There were about 1,000 graphemes in the Old Kingdom period, reduced to around 750 to 850 in the classical language of the Middle Kingdom, but inflated to the order of some 5,000 signs in the Ptolemaic period.  Antonio Loprieno, Ancient Egyptian: A Linguistic Introduction (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1995), p.  12.   The standard inventory of characters used in Egyptology is Gardiner's sign list (1928–1953). 

Witness<====>50956<====>Witness   A witness is someone who has, who claims to have, or is thought, by someone with authority to compel testimony, to have knowledge relevant to an event or other matter of interest.  In law a witness is someone who, either voluntarily or under compulsion, provides testimonial evidence, either oral or written, of what he or she knows or claims to know about the matter before some official authorized to take such testimony. A percipient witness or eyewitness is one who testifies what they perceived through his or her senses (e. g: seeing, hearing, smelling, touching).   That perception might be either with the unaided human sense or with the aid of an instrument, e. 

Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones<====>50957<====>Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones   Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones is a 2002 American epic space opera film directed by George Lucas and written by Lucas and Jonathan Hales.  It is the second installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, and stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L.  Jackson, Christopher Lee, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Frank Oz. Set ten years after the events in The Phantom Menace, the galaxy is on the brink of civil war.  Led by a former Jedi named Count Dooku, thousands of planetary systems threaten to secede from the Galactic Republic. 

Sulfur dioxide<====>50958<====>Sulfur dioxide Sulfur dioxide (also sulphur dioxide) is the chemical compound with the formula  .  At standard atmosphere, it is a toxic gas with a pungent, irritating smell.  It is released naturally by volcanic activity and is produced as a by-product of the burning of fossil fuels contaminated with sulfur compounds. Structure and bondingSO 2  is a bent molecule with C 2v  symmetry point group. A valence bond theory approach considering just s and p orbitals would describe the bonding in terms of resonance between two resonance structures. The sulfur–oxygen bond has a bond order of 1. 

Italian neorealism<====>50959<====>Italian neorealism Italian neorealism ( ), also known as the Golden Age, is a national film movement characterized by stories set amongst the poor and the working class, filmed on location, frequently using non-professional actors.  Italian neorealism films mostly contend with the difficult economic and moral conditions of post-World War II Italy, representing changes in the Italian psyche and conditions of everyday life, including poverty, oppression, injustice, and desperation. HistoryItalian neorealism came about as World War II ended and Benito Mussolini's government fell, causing the Italian film industry to lose its centre.  Neorealism was a sign of cultural change and social progress in Italy. 

Joan Baez<====>50960<====>Joan Baez   Joan Chandos Baez ( ;  born January 9, 1941) is an American folk singer, songwriter, musician, and activist  whose contemporary folk music often includes songs of protest or social justice, Jackson, Ernie.

Fluent in Spanish and English, she has also recorded songs in at least six other languages.  She is regarded as a folk singer, although her music has diversified since the counterculture days of the 1960s and now encompasses everything from folk rock and pop to country and gospel music. 

John Balliol<====>50961<====>John Balliol    John Balliol  (  – late 1314), known derisively as Toom Tabard (meaning "empty coat") was King of Scots from 1292 to 1296.  Little is known of his early life.  After the death of Margaret, Maid of Norway, Scotland entered an interregnum during which several competitors for the Crown of Scotland put forward claims.   Balliol was chosen from among them as the new King of Scotland by a group of selected noblemen headed by King Edward I of England.  Edward used his influence over the process to subjugate Scotland and undermined Balliol's personal reign by treating Scotland as a vassal of England. 

List of national independence days<====>50963<====>List of national independence days  An Independence Day is an annual event commemorating the anniversary of a nation's independence or statehood, usually after ceasing to be a group or part of another nation or state; more rarely after the end of a military occupation; and in the unique case of Singapore, expulsion from Malaysia. Most countries observe their respective independence days as national holidays.  ListThe following is a partial list of independence days of countries around the world:Country Date of holiday Year celebrated Event celebrated Name of holiday1919 Independence from the United Kingdom in 1919. 

Liouville number<====>50964<====>Liouville numberIn number theory, a Liouville number is an irrational number x with the property that, for every positive integer n, there exist integers p and  q with q > 1 and such that 0 A Liouville number can thus be approximated "quite closely" by a sequence of rational numbers.  In 1844, Joseph Liouville showed that all Liouville numbers are transcendental, thus establishing the existence of transcendental numbers for the first time. The existence of Liouville numbers (Liouville's constant)Here we show that Liouville numbers exist by exhibiting a construction that produces such numbers. For any integer b ≥ 2, and any sequence of integers (a 1 , a 2 , …, ), such that a k  ∈ {0, 1, 2, …, b - 1} ∀k ∈ {1, 2, 3, …} and there are infinitely many k with a k  ≠ 0, define the number x = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{a_k}{b^{k!}} In the special case when b = 10, and a k  = 1, ∀k, the resulting number x is called Liouville's constant.

Grenoble<====>50972<====>Grenoble  Grenoble ( ;   ;  ) is a city in southeastern France, at the foot of the French Alps where the river Drac joins the Isère.  Located in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, Grenoble is the capital of the department of Isère  and is an important European scientific centre.   The city advertises itself as the "Capital of the Alps", due to its size and its proximity to the mountains. Grenoble's history goes back over 2,000 years, to a time when it was a small Gallic village.  It gained somewhat in stature by becoming the capital of the Dauphiné  in the 11th century, but Grenoble remained for most of its history a modest parliamentary and garrison city on the borders of the kingdom of France. 

List of medical abbreviations<====>50973<====>List of medical abbreviations  Abbreviations are used very frequently in medicine.  They boost efficiency as long as they are used intelligently.  The advantages of brevity should be weighed against the possibilities of obfuscation (making the communication harder for others to understand) and ambiguity (having more than one possible interpretation).  Certain medical abbreviations are avoided to prevent mistakes, according to best practices (and in some cases regulatory requirements); these are flagged in the list of abbreviations used in medical prescriptions. Orthographic stylingPeriods (stops)Periods (stops) are often used in styling abbreviations.  Prevalent practice in medicine today is often to  forego them as unnecessary.

CT scan<====>50982<====>CT scan  A CT scan, also known as computed tomography scan, makes use of computer-processed combinations of many X-ray measurements taken from different angles to produce cross-sectional (tomographic) images (virtual "slices") of specific areas of a scanned object, allowing the user to see inside the object without cutting.  Other terms include computed axial tomography (CAT scan) and computer aided tomography. Digital geometry processing is used to further generate a three-dimensional volume of the inside of the object from a large series of two-dimensional radiographic images taken around a single axis of rotation.

Lelystad<====>50994<====>Lelystad{{Infobox settlement  }}Lelystad ( ) is a municipality and a city in the centre of the Netherlands, and it is the capital of the province of Flevoland.  The city, built on reclaimed land, was founded in 1967 and was named after Cornelis Lely, who engineered the Afsluitdijk, making the reclamation possible.  Lelystad is approximately   below sea level. HistoryLelystad is built on the seabed of the former Zuiderzee.  About 6500 years ago this wetland was above high tide level and inhabited; the Netherlands have steadily subsided since.  Near Lelystad at Swifterbant, the oldest human skeletons in Western Europe were discovered. 

IJsselmeer<====>50995<====>IJsselmeer The IJsselmeer ( ; West Frisian language: Iselmar), is a closed off inland bay in the central Netherlands bordering the provinces of Flevoland, North Holland and Friesland.  It measures 1100 km² with an average depth of 5. 5 m.  The river IJssel flows into the IJsselmeer. The first two letters of the name are capitalized because IJ is a digraph or even a ligature in Dutch, so it is treated as a single letter.

Latins<====>50996<====>Latins  Latins referred originally to an Italic tribe in ancient central Italy from Latium.  As Roman power and colonization  spread Latin culture, Latins came to mean mostly unified Italic people and Romanized Iberians, Celts, Dacians, and some Illyrians whose land was conquered by Latin colonists and who have abandoned their languages and identity for Latin and were assimilated by Rome in to common Roman identity with Latinized culture and speaking Latin or a Romance language (see Latin peoples).  The original Latins were an Italic tribe inhabiting central Italy, in present-day Lazio.  Through the conquests of their most populous city-state, Rome, the Latins united all Italic tribes in to one group and then with "Romanization" or "Latinization" spread their influence across their empire.

In either late 67 or early 68, he rebelled against Emperor Nero.  Though the aims of his followers may have been more complex, Vindex, as a senator, probably had the aim simply of replacing Nero with a better emperor.  Galba, Otho and Vitellius: Careers and Controversies (Spudasmata: Studien zur Klassichen Philologie und ihren Grenzgebieten)by Charles L.  Murison p3   According to the historian Cassius Dio, Vindex "was powerful in body and of shrewd intelligence, was skilled in warfare and full of daring for any great enterprise; and he had a passionate love of freedom and a vast ambition" (Cassius Dio, 63. 

Rigging<====>51011<====>Rigging Rigging comprises the system of ropes, cables and chains, which support a sailing ship or sail boat's masts—standing rigging, including shrouds and stays—and which adjust the position of the vessel's sails and spars to which they are attached—the running rigging, including halyards, braces, sheets and vangs.    EtymologyAccording to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition "rigging" derives from Anglo-Saxon wrigan or wringing, "to clothe".  The same source points out that "rigging" a sailing vessel refers to putting all the components in place to allow it to function, including the masts, spars, sails and the rigging.    Types of riggingRigging is divided into two classes, standing, which supports the mast (and bowsprit), and running, which controls the orientation of the sails and their degree of reefing.

Slurry pipeline<====>51013<====>Slurry pipelineA slurry pipeline is a specially engineered pipeline used to move ores, such as coal or iron, or mining waste, called tailings, over long distances.  A mixture of the ore concentrate and water, called slurry, is pumped to its destination and the water is filtered out.  Due to the abrasive properties of slurry, the pipelines can be lined with high-density polyethylene (HDPE).   Slurry pipelines are used as an alternative to railroad transportation when mines are located in remote, inaccessible areas. ProcessThe concentrate of the ore is mixed with water and then pumped over a long distance to a port where it can be shipped for further processing.

Siren (mythology)<====>51017<====>Siren (mythology)  In Greek mythology, the Sirens (Greek singular:   Seirēn; Greek plural:   Seirēnes) were dangerous creatures, who lured nearby sailors with their enchanting music and singing voices to shipwreck on the rocky coast of their island.  Roman poets placed them on some small islands called Sirenum scopuli.  In some later, rationalized traditions, the literal geography of the "flowery" island of Anthemoessa, or Anthemusa,  is fixed: sometimes on Cape Pelorum and at others in the islands known as the Sirenuse, near Paestum, or in Capreae.   All such locations were surrounded by cliffs and rocks. 

Civil defense siren<====>51018<====>Civil defense siren  A civil defense siren (also known as an air-raid siren or tornado siren) is a siren used to provide emergency population warning of approaching danger and sometimes to indicate when the danger has passed.  Some (that are mostly located in small towns) are also used to call the volunteer fire department to go fight a fire.  Initially designed to warn of air raids in World War II, they were adapted to warn of nuclear attack and of natural  destructive weather patterns such as tornadoes.  The generalized nature of the siren led to many of them being replaced with more specialized warnings, such as the Emergency Alert System. 

North Norfolk Railway<====>51022<====>North Norfolk Railway    The North Norfolk Railway (NNR) – also known as the "Poppy Line" – is a heritage steam railway in Norfolk, England, running between the coastal towns of Sheringham and Holt.  It  cuts through the countryside to the east of Weybourne with views of its windmill and passes through the well preserved country station which also houses a locomotive shed together with a carriage maintenance and restoration centre.  The Norfolk Orbital Railway, an independent organisation, has plans to join and link the NNR with the Mid-Norfolk Railway. DescriptionThe line, which is just over   long, once formed part of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway. 

Electroplating<====>51025<====>ElectroplatingElectroplating is a process that uses electric current to reduce dissolved metal cations so that they form a thin coherent metal coating on an electrode.  The term is also used for electrical oxidation of anions on to a solid substrate, as in the formation of silver chloride on silver wire to make silver/silver-chloride electrodes.  Electroplating is primarily used to change the surface properties of an object (such as abrasion and wear resistance, corrosion protection, lubricity, aesthetic qualities), but may also be used to build up thickness on undersized parts or to form objects by electroforming. The process used in electroplating is called electrodeposition. 

Patronymic<====>51027<====>Patronymic    A patronymic, or patronym, is a component of a personal name based on the given name of one's father, grandfather (i. e. , an avonymic),   or an even earlier male ancestor.  A component of a name based on the name of one's mother or a female ancestor is a matronymic.  Each is a means of conveying lineage.  In such instances, a person is usually referred to by their given name, rather than their patronymic. Patronymics are still in use, including mandatory use, in many countries worldwide, although their use has largely been replaced by or transformed into patronymic surnames. 

Cinematographer<====>51028<====>CinematographerA cinematographer or director of photography (sometimes shortened to DP or DOP) is the chief over the camera and light crews working on a film, television production or other live action piece and is responsible for making artistic and technical decisions related to the image.  The study and practice of this field is referred to as cinematography. The cinematographer selects the camera, film stock, lens, filters, etc. , to realize the scene in accordance with the intentions of the director.  Relations between the cinematographer and director vary; in some instances the director will allow the cinematographer complete independence; in others, the director allows little to none, even going so far as to specify exact camera placement and lens selection. 

George Alec Effinger<====>51029<====>George Alec Effinger George Alec Effinger (January 10, 1947 – April 27, 2002) was an American science fiction author, born in Cleveland, Ohio. Writing careerEffinger was a part of the Clarion class of 1970 and had three stories in the first Clarion anthology.  His first published story was "The Eight-Thirty to Nine Slot" in Fantastic in 1971.  During his early period, he also published under a variety of pseudonyms. His first novel, What Entropy Means to Me (1972), was nominated for the Nebula Award.  He achieved his greatest success with the trilogy of Marîd Audran novels set in a 22nd-century Middle East, with cybernetic implants and modules allowing individuals to change their personalities or bodies. 

Braunschweig<====>51032<====>Braunschweig  Braunschweig ( ; Low German: Brunswiek  ), also called Brunswick in English,  is a city of 252,768 people (as of 31 December 2015),  located in the state of Lower Saxony, Germany.  It is situated north of the Harz mountains at the furthest navigable point of the Oker river, which connects to the North Sea via the rivers Aller and Weser. A powerful and influential centre of commerce in medieval Germany, Braunschweig was a member of the Hanseatic League from the 13th until the 17th century.  It was the capital city of three successive states: the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1269–1432, 1754–1807 and 1813–1814), the Duchy of Brunswick (1814–1918) and the Free State of Brunswick (1918–1946). 

Prohibition of drugs<====>51036<====>Prohibition of drugs   The prohibition of drugs through sumptuary legislation or religious law is a common means of attempting to prevent the recreational use of the certain recreational drugs and other intoxicating substances. While some drugs are illegal to possess, many governments regulate the manufacture, distribution, marketing, sale and use of certain drugs, for instance through a prescription system.  For example, amphetamines may be legal to possess if a doctor has prescribed them; otherwise, possession or sale of the drug is typically a criminal offence.   Only certain drugs are banned with a "blanket prohibition" against all possession or use (e.

Second Peace of Thorn (1466)<====>51040<====>Second Peace of Thorn (1466)The  Peace of Thorn of 1466 ( ;  ) was a peace treaty signed in the Hanseatic city of Thorn (Toruń) on 19 October 1466 between the Polish king Casimir IV Jagiellon on one side, and the Teutonic Knights on the other. The treaty concluded the Thirteen Years' War  which had begun in February 1454 with the revolt of the Prussian Confederation, led by the cities of Danzig (Gdańsk), Elbing (Elbląg), Kulm (Chełmno) and Thorn, and the Prussian gentry against the rule of the Teutonic Knights in the Monastic State. Both sides agreed to seek confirmation from Pope Paul II and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III, but the Polish side stressed (and the Teutonic side agreed) that this confirmation would not be needed for validation of the treaty. 

Paleoclimatology<====>51042<====>Paleoclimatology  Paleoclimatology (in British spelling, palaeoclimatology) is the study of changes in climate taken on the scale of the entire history of Earth.  It uses a variety of proxy methods from the Earth and life sciences to obtain data previously preserved within things such as rocks, sediments, ice sheets, tree rings, corals, shells, and microfossils.  It then uses the records to determine the past states of the Earth's various climate regions and its atmospheric system.  Studies of past changes in the environment and biodiversity often reflect on the current situation, specifically the impact of climate on mass extinctions and biotic recovery. 

Charles Lapworth<====>51043<====>Charles Lapworth    Prof Charles Lapworth, LLD, FGS (20 September 1842 – 13 March 1920) was an English geologist  who pioneered faunal analysis using index fossils and identified the Ordovician period. BiographyCharles Lapworth was born at Faringdon in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire) the son of James Lapworth.   He was trained as a teacher at the Culham Diocesan Training College near Abingdon, Oxfordshire.  He moved to the Scottish border region, where he investigated the previously little-known fossil fauna of the area.  There in 1869 he married Janet, daughter of Galashiels schoolmaster Walter Sanderson and stayed in the area. 

Guided rat<====>51045<====>Guided ratA remotely guided rat, popularly called a ratbot or robo-rat, is a rat with electrodes implanted in the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) and sensorimotor cortex of its brain.  They were developed in 2002 by Sanjiv Talwar and John Chapin at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center.   The rats wear a small electronics backpack containing a radio receiver and electrical stimulator.   The rat receives remote stimulation in the sensorimotor cortex via its backpack that causes the rat to feel a sensation in its left or right whiskers, and stimulation in the MFB that is interpreted as a reward or pleasure. 

Francesco Foscari<====>51049<====>Francesco Foscari  Francesco Foscari (19 June 1373 – 1 November 1457) was the 65th Doge of the Republic of Venice from 1423 to 1457.  His reign, the longest of all Doges in Venetian history, lasted 34 years, 6 months and 8 days, and coincided with the inception of the Italian Renaissance. Biography Francesco Foscari was born in 1373, as the oldest son of Niccolò Foscari and his wife Cateruzia Michiel.   The Foscari family had been of only moderate importance, but had managed to become one of the few noble families that secured a hereditary place in the Great Council of Venice after the so-called Serrata ("Closing") of the Great Council, and had begun to rise in prominence throughout the 14th century. 

Battle of the Crater<====>51051<====>Battle of the Crater  The Battle of the Crater was a battle of the American Civil War, part of the Siege of Petersburg.  It took place on July 30, 1864, between the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, commanded by General Robert E.  Lee and the Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Maj.  Gen.  George G.  Meade (under the direct supervision of the general-in-chief, Lt.  Gen.  Ulysses S.  Grant). After weeks of preparation, on July 30, Union forces exploded a mine in Maj.  Gen.  Ambrose E.  Burnside's IX Corps sector, blowing a gap in the Confederate defenses of Petersburg, Virginia. 

Semiotic literary criticism<====>51052<====>Semiotic literary criticism Semiotic literary criticism, also called literary semiotics, is the approach to literary criticism informed by the theory of signs or semiotics.  Semiotics, tied closely to the structuralism pioneered by Ferdinand de Saussure, was extremely influential in the development of literary theory out of the formalist approaches of the early twentieth century.  The early forms of literary semiotics grew out of formalist approaches to literature, especially Russian formalism, and structuralist linguistics, especially the Prague school.   Notable early semiotic authors included Vladimir Propp, Algirdas Julius Greimas, and Viktor Shklovsky.   These critics were concerned with a formal analysis of narrative forms which would resemble a literary mathematics, or at least a literary syntax, as far as possible. 

Psychoanalytic literary criticism<====>51053<====>Psychoanalytic literary criticismPsychoanalytic literary criticism is literary criticism or literary theory which, in method, concept, or form, is influenced by the tradition of psychoanalysis begun by Sigmund Freud. Psychoanalytic reading has been practiced since the early development of psychoanalysis itself, and has developed into a heterogeneous interpretive tradition.  As Celine Surprenant writes, 'Psychoanalytic literary criticism does not constitute a unified field.  However, all variants endorse, at least to a certain degree, the idea that literature . . .  is fundamentally entwined with the psyche'.  OverviewThe object of psychoanalytic literary criticism, at its very simplest, can be the psychoanalysis of the author or of a particularly interesting character in a given work. 

American black bear<====>51054<====>American black bear    The American black bear (Ursus americanus) is a medium-sized bear native to North America. It is the continent's smallest and most widely distributed bear species.  Black bears are omnivores, with their diets varying greatly depending on season and location.  They typically live in largely forested areas, but do leave forests in search of food.  Sometimes they become attracted to human communities because of the immediate availability of food.  The American black bear is the world's most common bear species. It is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a least-concern species, due to its widespread distribution and a large population estimated to be twice that of all other bear species combined. 

Lake Huron<====>51056<====>Lake Huron Lake Huron ( ) is one of the five Great Lakes of North America.  Hydrologically, it comprises the easterly portion of Lake Michigan–Huron, having the same surface elevation as its westerly counterpart, to which it is connected by the  ,   Straits of Mackinac.  It is shared on the north and east by the Canadian province of Ontario and on the south and west by the state of Michigan in the United States.  The name of the lake is derived from early French explorers who named it for the Huron people inhabiting the region. 

Feminist literary criticism<====>51058<====>Feminist literary criticism Feminist literary criticism is literary criticism informed by feminist theory, or more broadly, by the politics of feminism.  It uses feminist principles and ideology to critique the language of literature.  This school of thought seeks to analyze and describe the ways in which literature portrays the narrative of male domination by exploring the economic, social, political, and psychological forces embedded within literature.   This way of thinking and criticizing works can be said to have changed the way literary texts are viewed and studied, as well as changing and expanding the canon of what is commonly taught. 

Anomie<====>51067<====>Anomie   Anomie ( ) is a "condition in which society provides little moral guidance to individuals".   It is the breakdown of social bonds between an individual and the community, e. g. , under unruly scenarios resulting in fragmentation of social identity and rejection of self-regulatory values.    It was popularized by French sociologist Émile Durkheim in his influential book Suicide (1897).  Durkheim never uses the term normlessness; rather, he describes anomie as "derangement", and "an insatiable will".   Durkheim used the term "the malady of the infinite" because desire without limit can never be fulfilled; it only becomes more intense. 

Conventional superconductor<====>51070<====>Conventional superconductor Conventional superconductors are materials that display superconductivity as described by BCS theory or its extensions.  This is in contrast to unconventional superconductors, which do not.  Conventional superconductors can be either type-I or type-II. Most elemental superconductors are conventional.  Niobium and vanadium are type-II, while most other elemental superconductors are type-I.  Critical temperatures of some elemental superconductors:Element T c  (K) Al 1. 20 Hg 4. 15 Mo 0. 92 Nb 9. 26 Pb 7. 19 Sn 3. 72 Ta 4. 48 Ti 0. 39 V 5. 30 Zn 0. 88 Most compound and alloy superconductors are type-II materials. 

Natural deduction<====>51072<====>Natural deductionIn logic and proof theory, natural deduction is a kind of proof calculus in which logical reasoning is expressed by inference rules closely related to the "natural" way of reasoning.  This contrasts with Hilbert-style systems, which instead use axioms as much as possible to express the logical laws of deductive reasoning. MotivationNatural deduction grew out of a context of dissatisfaction with the axiomatizations of deductive reasoning common to the systems of Hilbert, Frege, and Russell (see, e. g. , Hilbert system).  Such axiomatizations were most famously used by Russell and Whitehead in their mathematical treatise Principia Mathematica. 

Peter Kropotkin<====>51074<====>Peter Kropotkin    Pyotr Alexeevich Kropotkin ( ;   ; December 9, 1842 – February 8, 1921) was a Russian activist, scientist, and philosopher, who advocated anarchism. Born into an aristocratic land-owning family, he attended a military school and later served as an officer in Siberia, where he participated in several geological expeditions.  He was imprisoned for his activism in 1874 and managed to escape two years later.  He spent the next 41 years in exile in Switzerland, France (where he was imprisoned for almost 4 years) and in England.  He returned to Russia after the Russian Revolution in 1917 but was disappointed by the Bolshevik form of state socialism. 

Thalidomide<====>51078<====>Thalidomide  Thalidomide, sold under the brand name Immunoprin, among others, is an immunomodulatory drug and the prototype of the thalidomide class of drugs.  Today, thalidomide is used mainly as a treatment of certain cancers (multiple myeloma) and of a complication of leprosy.  Thalidomide was first marketed in 1957 in West Germany under the trade-name Contergan.  The German drug company Chemie Grünenthal developed and sold the drug.  Primarily prescribed as a sedative or hypnotic, thalidomide also claimed to cure "anxiety, insomnia, gastritis, and tension".Afterwards, it was used against nausea and to alleviate morning sickness in pregnant women. 

Magnet<====>51079<====>Magnet A magnet is a material or object that produces a magnetic field.  This magnetic field is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, and attracts or repels other magnets.  The overall strength of a magnet is measured by its magnetic moment or, alternatively, the total magnetic flux it produces.  The local strength of magnetism in a material is measured by its magnetization. A permanent magnet is an object made from a material that is magnetized and creates its own persistent magnetic field.

Mikael Agricola<====>51083<====>Mikael Agricola  Mikael Agricola (   ; c.  1510 – 9 April 1557) was a Lutheran clergyman who became the de facto founder of literary Finnish and a prominent proponent of the Protestant Reformation in Sweden, including Finland, which was a Swedish territory at the time.  He is often called the "father of literary Finnish".  Agricola was consecrated as the bishop of Turku (Åbo) in 1554, without papal approval.   As a result, he began a reform of the Finnish church (then a part of the Church of Sweden) along Lutheran lines.   He translated the New Testament into Finnish and also produced the prayer book and hymns used in Finland's new Lutheran Church. 

Unconventional superconductor<====>51084<====>Unconventional superconductor Unconventional superconductors are materials that display superconductivity which does not conform to either the conventional BCS theory or Nikolay Bogolyubov's theory or its extensions. HistoryThe superconducting properties of  CeCu 2 Si 2 , a type ofheavy fermion material, were reported in 1979 by Frank Steglich.    For a long time it was believed that CeCu 2 Si 2    is a singlet d-wave superconductor but recently, it has become clear  that this is not correct.    In  the early eighties, many more unconventional, heavy fermion superconductors were discovered, including UBe 13 ,  UPt 3    and URu 2 Si 2 .

Francis Walsingham<====>51106<====>Francis Walsingham   Sir Francis Walsingham (  1532 – 6 April 1590) was principal secretary to Queen Elizabeth I of England from 20 December 1573 until his death and is popularly remembered as her "spymaster". Born to a well-connected family of gentry, Walsingham attended Cambridge University and travelled in continental Europe before embarking on a career in law at the age of twenty.  A committed Protestant, during the reign of the Catholic Queen Mary I of England he joined other expatriates in exile in Switzerland and northern Italy until Mary's death and the accession of her Protestant half-sister, Elizabeth. Walsingham rose from relative obscurity to become one of the small coterie who directed the Elizabethan state, overseeing foreign, domestic and religious policy. 

Poison<====>51108<====>Poison In biology, poisons are substances that cause disturbances in organisms, usually by chemical reaction or other activity on the molecular scale, when an organism absorbs a sufficient quantity.   The fields of medicine (particularly veterinary) and zoology often distinguish a poison from a toxin, and from a venom.  Toxins are poisons produced by organisms in nature, and venoms are toxins injected by a bite or sting (this is exclusive to animals).  The difference between venom and other poisons is the delivery method.  Industry, agriculture, and other sectors use poisons for reasons other than their toxicity. 

Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor<====>51109<====>Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor  Charles VII (6 August 1697 – 20 January 1745)  was the prince-elector of Bavaria from 1726 and Holy Roman Emperor from 24 January 1742 until his death in 1745.  A member of the House of Wittelsbach, Charles was the first person not born of the House of Habsburg to become emperor in over three centuries, though he was connected to that house both by blood and by marriage. Early life and careerCharles Albert was born in Brussels, the son of Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, and Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska, daughter of King John III Sobieski of Poland.

Albert Pollard says, "From 1558 for forty years the biography of Cecil is almost indistinguishable from that of Elizabeth and from the history of England. " Burghley set as the main goal of English policy the creation of a united and Protestant British Isles.  His methods were to complete the control of Ireland, and to forge an alliance with Scotland. 

Clemens August of Bavaria<====>51113<====>Clemens August of Bavaria Clemens August of Bavaria ( ) (17 August 1700 – 6 February 1761) was a member of the Wittelsbach dynasty of Bavaria and Archbishop-Elector of Cologne. BiographyClemens August (Clementus Augustus) was born in Brussels, the son of Elector Maximilian II Emanuel of Bavaria and Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska and the grandson of King John III Sobieski of Poland.  His family was split during the War of the Spanish Succession and was for many years under house arrest in Austria; only in 1715 did the family become re-united. His uncle Joseph Clemens, Elector and Archbishop of Cologne, saw to it that Clemens August received several appointments in Altötting, the Diocese of Regensburg, and at the Prince-Provostry of Berchtesgaden, and he soon received papal confirmation as Bishop of Regensburg, and later of Cologne. 

Transport economics<====>51114<====>Transport economics Transport economics is a branch of economics founded in 1959 by American economist John R.  Meyer that deals with the allocation of resources within the transport sector.  It has strong links to civil engineering.  Transport economics differs from some other branches of economics in that the assumption of a spaceless, instantaneous economy does not hold.  People and goods flow over networks at certain speeds.   Demands peak.   Advance ticket purchase is often induced by lower fares.   The networks themselves may or may not be competitive.  A single trip (the final good, in the consumer's eyes) may require the bundling of services provided by several firms, agencies and modes. 

Meissner effect<====>51117<====>Meissner effect The Meissner effect (or Meissner–Ochsenfeld effect) is the expulsion of a magnetic field from a superconductor during its transition to the superconducting state.  The German physicists Walther Meissner and Robert Ochsenfeld   discovered this phenomenon in 1933 by measuring the magnetic field distribution outside superconducting tin and lead samples.The samples, in the presence of an applied magnetic field, were cooled below their superconducting transition temperature, whereupon the samples cancelled nearly all interior magnetic fields.  They detected this effect only indirectly because the magnetic flux is conserved by a superconductor: when the interior field decreases, the exterior field increases. 

Literary theory<====>51119<====>Literary theory  The literary theory in a strict sense is the systematic study of the nature of literature and of the methods for analyzing literature.  Culler 1997, p. 1  However, literary scholarship since the 19th century often includes—in addition to, or even instead of literary theory in the strict sense—considerations of intellectual history, moral philosophy, social prophecy, and other interdisciplinary themes which are of relevance to the way humans interpret meaning.   In humanities in modern academia, the latter style of scholarship is an outgrowth of critical theory and is often called simply "theory".  Searle, John. 

Literary criticism<====>51123<====>Literary criticism   Literary criticism (or literary studies) is the study, evaluation, and interpretation of literature.  Modern literary criticism is often influenced by literary theory, which is the philosophical discussion of literature's goals and methods.  Though the two activities are closely related, literary critics are not always, and have not always been, theorists. Whether or not literary criticism should be considered a separate field of inquiry from literary theory, or conversely from book reviewing, is a matter of some controversy.  For example, the Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism  draws no distinction between literary theory and literary criticism, and almost always uses the terms together to describe the same concept. 

Pangolin<====>51124<====>Pangolin  Pangolins are mammals of the order Pholidota.  The one extant family, Manidae, has three genera: Manis, which comprises four species living in Asia; Phataginus, which comprises two species living in Africa; and Smutsia, which comprises two species also living in Africa.These species range in size from  .  A number of extinct pangolin species are also known. Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales covering their skin, and they are the only known mammals with this feature.  They live in hollow trees or burrows, depending on the species.  Pangolins are nocturnal, and their diet consists of mainly ants and termites which they capture using their long tongues. 

Pierrot<====>51126<====>Pierrot Pierrot ( ) is a stock character of pantomime and commedia dell'arte whose origins are in the late seventeenth-century Italian troupe of players performing in Paris and known as the Comédie-Italienne; the name is a diminutive of Pierre (Peter), via the suffix  .  His character in contemporary popular culture—in poetry, fiction, and the visual arts, as well as works for the stage, screen, and concert hall—is that of the sad clown, pining for love of Columbine, who usually breaks his heart and leaves him for Harlequin.

Nash embedding theorem<====>51129<====>Nash embedding theoremThe Nash embedding theorems (or imbedding theorems), named after John Forbes Nash, state that every Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded into some Euclidean space.  Isometric means preserving the length of every path.   For instance, bending without stretching or tearing a page of paper gives an isometric embedding of the page into Euclidean space because curves drawn on the page retain the same arclength however the page is bent. The first theorem is for continuously differentiable (C 1 ) embeddings and the second for analytic embeddings or embeddings that are smooth of class C k , 3 ≤ k ≤ ∞. 

College of Sorbonne<====>51130<====>College of Sorbonne The College of Sorbonne ( ) was a theological college of the University of Paris, founded in 1253 by Robert de Sorbon (1201–1274), after whom it was named.

SoftICE<====>51137<====>SoftICE   SoftICE is a kernel mode debugger for Microsoft Windows up to Windows XP.  Crucially, it is designed to run underneath Windows such that the operating system is unaware of its presence.  Unlike an application debugger, SoftICE is capable of suspending all operations in Windows when instructed.  For driver debugging this is critical due to how hardware is accessed and the kernel of the operating system functions.  Because of its low-level capabilities, SoftICE is also popular as a software cracking tool. Microsoft offers two kernel-mode debuggers, WinDbg and KD, for no charge.  However, the full capabilities of WinDbg and KD are available only when two interlinked computers are used. 

Mail<====>51138<====>Mail  The mail or post is a system for physically transporting postcards, letters, and parcels.   A postal service can be private or public, though many governments place restrictions on private systems.  Since the mid-19th century, national postal systems have generally been established as government monopolies with a fee on the article prepaid.  Proof of payment is often in the form of adhesive postage stamps, but postage meters are also used for bulk mailing.  Modern private postal systems are typically distinguished from national postal agencies by the names "courier" or "delivery service". Postal authorities often have functions other than transporting letters.

Giant-impact hypothesis<====>51143<====>Giant-impact hypothesis The giant-impact hypothesis, sometimes called the Big Splash, or the Theia Impact suggests that the Moon formed out of the debris left over from a collision between Earth and an astronomical body the size of Mars, approximately 4. 5 billion years ago, in the Hadean eon; about 20 to 100 million years after the solar system coalesced.The colliding body is sometimes called Theia, from the name of the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the Moon.    Analysis of lunar rocks, published in a 2016 report, suggests that the impact may have been a direct hit, causing a thorough mixing of both parent bodies. 

Scat singing<====>51144<====>Scat singingIn vocal jazz, scat singing is vocal improvisation with wordless vocables, nonsense syllables or without words at all.  In scat singing, the singer improvises melodies and rhythms using the voice as an instrument rather than a speaking medium. CharacteristicsStructure and syllable choiceThough scat singing is improvised, the melodic lines are often variations on scale and arpeggio fragments, stock patterns and riffs, as is the case with instrumental improvisers.  As well, scatting usually incorporates musical structure.  All of Ella Fitzgerald's scat performances of "How High the Moon", for instance, use the same tempo, begin with a chorus of a straight reading of the lyric, move to a "specialty chorus" introducing the scat chorus, and then the scat itself.

There are also Quikscript alphabets adapted for other languages, using the same letters for sounds which do not exist in English. Origins and history George Bernard Shaw, the writer, critic and playwright, was a highly vocal critic of English spelling because it lacked a coherent system for representing the phonemes of English accurately. 

Uncle Tom<====>51174<====>Uncle Tom   Uncle Tom is the title character of Harriet Beecher Stowe's 1852 novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin. The term "Uncle Tom" is also used as a derogatory epithet for an exceedingly subservient person, particularly when that person is aware of their own lower-class status based on race.  The use of the epithet is the result of later works derived from the original novel.  Original characterization and critical evaluationsAt the time of the novel's initial publication in 1851, Uncle Tom was a rejection of the existing stereotypes of minstrel shows; Stowe's melodramatic story humanized the suffering of slavery for white audiences by portraying Tom as a Jesus-like figure who is ultimately martyred, beaten to death by a cruel master because he refuses to betray the whereabouts of two women who had escaped from slavery.

Samizdat<====>51200<====>Samizdat    Samizdat was a form of dissident activity across the Soviet bloc in which individuals reproduced censored and underground publications by hand and passed the documents from reader to reader.  This grassroots practice to evade official Soviet censorship was fraught with danger, as harsh punishments were meted out to people caught possessing or copying censored materials.  Vladimir Bukovsky summarized it as follows: "Samizdat: I write it myself, edit it myself, censor it myself, publish it myself, distribute it myself, and spend jail time for it myself. " Name origin and variationsEtymologically, the word samizdat derives from sam ( , "self, by oneself") and izdat ( , an abbreviation of  , "publishing house"), and thus means "self-published". 

Coefficient<====>51203<====>Coefficient   In mathematics, a coefficient is a multiplicative factor in some term of a polynomial, a series or any expression; it is usually a number, but may be any expression.  In the latter case, the variables appearing in the coefficients are often called parameters, and must be clearly distinguished from the other variables.  For example, in 7x^2-3xy+1. 5+y, the first two terms respectively have the coefficients 7 and −3.  The third term 1. 5 is a constant.  The final term does not have any explicitly written coefficient, but is considered to have coefficient 1, since multiplying by that factor would not change the term. 

Kinase<====>51209<====>KinaseIn biochemistry, a kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate groups from high-energy, phosphate-donating molecules to specific substrates.  This process is known as phosphorylation, where the substrate gains a phosphate group and the high-energy ATP molecule donates a phosphate group.  This transesterification produces a phosphorylated substrate and ADP.  Conversely, it is referred to as dephosphorylation when the phosphorylated substrate donates a phosphate group and ADP gains a phosphate group (producing a dephosphorylated substrate and the high energy molecule of ATP).  These two processes, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, occur four times during glycolysis.  Kinases are part of the larger family of phosphotransferases. 

Slow-scan television<====>51210<====>Slow-scan television Slow Scan television (SSTV) is a picture transmission method used mainly by amateur radio operators, to transmit and receive static pictures via radio in monochrome or color. A literal term for SSTV is narrowband television.  Analog broadcast television requires at least 6 MHz wide channels, because it transmits 25 or 30 picture frames per second (in the NTSC, PAL or SECAM color systems), but SSTV usually only takes up to a maximum of 3 kHz of bandwidth.  It is a much slower method of still picture transmission, usually taking from about eight seconds to a couple of minutes, depending on the mode used, to transmit one image frame. 

Airliner<====>51215<====>Airliner An airliner is a type of aircraft for transporting passengers and air cargo.   Such aircraft are most often operated by airlines.   Although the definition of an airliner can vary from country to country, an airliner is typically defined as an aircraft intended for carrying multiple passengers or cargo in commercial service. The largest airliners are wide-body jets.   These aircraft are frequently called twin-aisle aircraft because they generally have two separate aisles running from the front to the back of the passenger cabin.  These aircraft are usually used for long-haul flights between airline hubs and major cities with many passengers. 

Culture of Egypt<====>51218<====>Culture of Egypt    The culture of Egypt has thousands of years of recorded history.  Ancient Egypt was among the earliest civilizations in Africa.  For millennia, Egypt maintained a strikingly unique, complex and stable culture that influenced later cultures of Europe.  After the Pharaonic era, Egypt itself came under the influence of Hellenism, for a time Christianity and later, Christian culture. Languages The Egyptian language, which formed a separate branch among the family of Afro-Asiatic languages, was among the first written languages and is known from the hieroglyphic inscriptions preserved on monuments and sheets of papyrus. 

Thrasamund<====>51219<====>Thrasamund Thrasamund (450–523), King of the Vandals and Alans (496–523), was the fourth king of the north African Kingdom of the Vandals, and reigned longer than any other Vandal king in Africa other than his grandfather Genseric. Thrasamund was the third son born to Genseric's fourth son, Gento, and became king in 496 after all of Genseric's sons and his own brother, King Gunthamund, had died.  Upon Gunthamund's death, he was one of only two living grandsons of Genseric, and inherited the throne in accordance with a law enacted by his grandfather, which bestowed the kingship on the eldest male member of a deceased king's family. 

Gunthamund<====>51221<====>Gunthamund Gunthamund (c.  450-496), King of the Vandals and Alans (484-496) was the third king of the north African Vandal Kingdom.  He succeeded his unpopular uncle Huneric, and for that reason alone, enjoyed a rather successful reign. Gunthamund was the second son born to Gento, the fourth and youngest son of Genseric, the founder of the Vandal kingdom in Africa.  Because most of Genseric's immediate family was dead, his elder brothers having been murdered by Huneric,  Gunthamund found himself as the eldest male member of the family when Huneric died in 484.  In accordance with his grandfather's laws on succession, which decreed that the oldest member of the family would be the successor, he was proclaimed king. 

War of Jenkins' Ear<====>51224<====>War of Jenkins' Ear The War of Jenkins' Ear (known as Guerra del Asiento in Spain) was a conflict between Britain and Spain lasting from 1739 to 1748, with major operations largely ended by 1742.  Its unusual name, coined by Thomas Carlyle in 1858,  refers to an ear severed from Robert Jenkins, a captain of a British merchant ship.  Despite stories to that effect, there is no evidence the severed ear was exhibited before the British Parliament. The seeds of conflict began with the separation of an ear from Jenkins following the boarding of his vessel by Spanish coast guards in 1731, eight years before the war began.

Industrial organization<====>51249<====>Industrial organization   In economics, industrial organization or industrial economy is a field that builds on the theory of the firm by examining the structure of (and, therefore, the boundaries between) firms and markets.  Industrial organization adds real-world complications to the perfectly competitive model, complications such as transaction costs,  limited information, and barriers to entry of new firms that may be associated with imperfect competition.  It analyzes determinants of firm and market organization and behavior as between competition  and monopoly,  including from government actions. There are different approaches to the subject.  One approach is descriptive in providing an overview of industrial organization, such as measures of competition and the size-concentration of firms in an industry.

Network File System<====>51252<====>Network File System   Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol originally developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984,allowing a user on a client computer to access files over a computer network much like local storage is accessed.  NFS, like many other protocols, builds on the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC RPC) system.  The NFS is an open standard defined in Request for Comments (RFC), allowing anyone to implement the protocol. Versions and variationsSun used version 1 only for in-house experimental purposes.  When the development team added substantial changes to NFS version 1 and released it outside of Sun, they decided to release the new version as v2, so that version interoperation and RPC version fallback could be tested.

Gordon Tullock, [1987] 2008, "public choice," The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics.  Abstract.   Its content includes the study of political behavior.  In political science, it is the subset of positive political theory that studies self-interested agents (voters, politicians, bureaucrats) and their interactions, which can be represented in a number of ways – using (for example) standard constrained utility maximization, game theory, or decision theory.   Public-choice analysis has roots in positive analysis ("what is") but is often used for normative purposes ("what ought to be") in order to identify a problem or to suggest improvements to constitutional rules (i. 

Peach<====>51257<====>Peach   The peach (Prunus persica) is a deciduous tree native to the region of Northwest China between the Tarim Basin and the north slopes of the Kunlun Shan mountains, where it was first domesticated and cultivated.   It bears an edible juicy fruit called a peach or a nectarine. The specific epithet persica refers to its widespread cultivation in Persia (modern-day Iran), whence it was transplanted to Europe.   It belongs to the genus Prunus which includes the cherry, apricot, almond and plum, in the rose family.

Iaijutsu<====>51263<====>Iaijutsu  , is a combative quick-draw sword technique.   This art of drawing the Japanese sword, katana, is one of the Japanese koryū martial art disciplines in the education of the classical warrior (bushi).  Warner, Gordon and Draeger, Donn F.  2007, 8th ed.  Japanese Swordsmanship: Technique and Practice, Boston: Weatherhill.PurposeIaijutsu is a combative sword-drawing art but not necessarily an aggressive art because iaijutsu is also a counterattack-oriented art.  Iaijutsu technique may be used aggressively to wage a premeditated surprise attack against an unsuspecting enemy.    The formulation of iaijutsu as a component system of classical bujutsu was made less for the dynamic situations of the battlefield than for the relatively static applications of the warrior's daily life off the field of battle. 

Kenjutsu<====>51265<====>Kenjutsu    is the umbrella term for all (koryū) schools of Japanese swordsmanship, in particular those that predate the Meiji Restoration.

Prince-bishop<====>51270<====>Prince-bishop   A prince-bishop is a bishop who is also the civil ruler of some secular principality and sovereignty.  Thus the principality or prince-bishopric ruled politically by a prince-bishop could wholly or largely overlap with his diocesan jurisdiction, since some parts of his diocese, even the city of his residence, could be exempt from his civil rule, obtaining the status of free imperial city.  If the episcopal see is an archbishopric, the correct term is prince-archbishop; the equivalent in the regular (monastic) clergy is prince-abbot.  A prince-bishop is usually considered an elected monarch. In the West, with the decline of imperial power from the 4th century onwards in the face of the barbarian invasions, sometimes Christian bishops of cities took the place of the Roman commander, made secular decisions for the city and led their own troops when necessary.

Translation memory<====>51288<====>Translation memoryA translation memory (TM) is a database that stores "segments", which can be sentences, paragraphs or sentence-like units (headings, titles or elements in a list) that have previously been translated, in order to aid human translators.  The translation memory stores the source text and its corresponding translation in language pairs called “translation units”.  Individual words are handled by terminology bases and are not within the domain of TM. Software programs that use translation memories are sometimes known as translation memory managers (TMM) or translation memory systems (TM systems, not to be confused with TMS, which is another type of sofware focused on managing process of translation).

Cowpox<====>51303<====>Cowpox Cowpox is an infectious disease caused by the cowpox virus.  The virus, part of the orthopoxvirus family, is closely related to the vaccinia virus.  The virus is zoonotic, meaning that it is transferable between species, such as from animal to human.  The transferral of the disease was first observed in dairymaids who touched the udders of infected cows and consequently developed the signature pustules on their hands.  Vanessa Ngan, "Viral and Skin Infections", 2009  Cowpox is more commonly found in animals other than bovines, such as rodents.  Cowpox is similar to, but much milder than, the highly contagious and often deadly smallpox disease.

History of Antarctica<====>51314<====>History of AntarcticaFor the natural history of the Antarctic continent, see Antarctica. The history of Antarctica emerges from early Western theories of a vast continent, known as Terra Australis, believed to exist in the far south of the globe.  The term Antarctic, referring to the opposite of the Arctic Circle, was coined by Marinus of Tyre in the 2nd century AD. The rounding of the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn in the 15th and 16th centuries proved that Terra Australis Incognita ("Unknown Southern Land"), if it existed, was a continent in its own right.  In 1773 James Cook and his crew crossed the Antarctic Circle for the first time but although they discovered nearby islands, they did not catch sight of Antarctica itself. 

Intellectual history<====>51319<====>Intellectual history Intellectual history refers to the historiography of ideas and thinkers.   This history cannot be considered without the knowledge of the humans who created, discussed, wrote about, and in other ways were concerned with ideas.  Intellectual history as practiced by historians is parallel to the history of philosophy as done by philosophers, and is more akin to the history of ideas.  Its central premise is that ideas do not develop in isolation from the people who create and use them, and that one must study ideas not as abstract propositions but in terms of the culture, lives, and historical contexts that produced them.

In the 19th and 20th century, it was generally Southeast and South Asia, as well as Eastern and Central Europe that suffered the most deaths from famine.  The numbers dying from famine began to fall sharply from the 1970s. Some countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, continue to have extreme cases of famine. 

Babington Plot<====>51330<====>Babington Plot   The Babington Plot was a plan in 1586 to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I, a Protestant, and put Mary, Queen of Scots, her Roman Catholic cousin, on the English throne.  It led to the Queen of Scots' execution, a direct result of a letter sent by Mary (who had been imprisoned for 19 years since 1568 in England at the behest of Elizabeth) in which she consented directly  to the assassination of Elizabeth.  The long-term goal of the plot was the invasion of England by the Spanish forces of King Philip II and the Catholic League in France, leading to the restoration of the old religion. 

Dimensionless quantity<====>51331<====>Dimensionless quantity In dimensional analysis, a dimensionless quantity is a quantity to which no physical dimension is applicable.  It is also known as a bare number or a quantity of dimension one  and the corresponding unit of measurement in the SI is one (or 1) unit   and it is not explicitly shown.  Dimensionless quantities are widely used in many fields, such as mathematics, physics, engineering, and economics.  By contrast, examples of quantities with dimensions are length, time, and speed, which are measured in dimensional units, such as metre, second and metre per second. History Quantities having dimension 1, habitually called dimensionless quantities, regularly occur in sciences, and are formally treated within the field of dimensional analysis. 

Power number<====>51332<====>Power numberFor Newton number, see also Kissing number in the sphere packing problem.The power number N p  (also known as Newton number) is a commonly used dimensionless number relating the resistance force to the inertia force. The power-number has different specifications according to the field of application. E.g., for stirrers the power number is defined as:  N_\mathrm{p} = \frac{P}{\rho n^{3} D^{5}}  with P: powerρ: fluid densityn: rotational speedD: diameter of stirrer  J Wei, J L Anderson, K B Bischoff Advances in Chemical Engineering, Volume 17 Academic Press (1991)   page 44 References See alsoReynolds numberArchimedes number

Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins<====>51357<====>Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), or simply dioxins, are a group of polyhalogenated organic compounds that are significant environmental pollutants. They are commonly but inaccurately referred to as dioxins for simplicity, because every PCDD molecule contains a dibenzo-1,4-dioxin skeletal structure, with 1,4-dioxin as the central ring.  Members of the PCDD family bioaccumulate in humans and wildlife because of their lipophilic properties, and may cause developmental disturbances and cancer. Dioxins occur as by-products in the manufacture of some organochlorides, in the incineration of chlorine-containing substances such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), in the chlorine bleaching of paper, and from natural sources such as volcanoes and forest fires.

History of North America<====>51370<====>History of North America History of North America encompasses the past developments of people populating the continent of North America.  While it was widely believed that continent first became a human habitat when people migrated across the Bering Sea 40,000 to 17,000 years ago,    recent discoveries may have pushed those estimates back at least another 90,000 years.   Regardless, migrants settled in many locations on the continent, from the Inuit of the far north to the Mayans and Aztecs of the south.  These isolated communities each developed their own unique ways of life and cultures, and their interaction with one another was limited in comparison to the extensive trade and conflict of civilizations across the Atlantic in Europe and Asia. 

History of South America<====>51372<====>History of South America  The history of South America is the study of the past, particularly the written record, oral histories, and traditions, passed down from generation to generation on the continent of South America.

The Norte Chico civilization in Peru is the oldest civilization in the Americas and one of the first six independent civilizations in the world; it was contemporaneous with the Egyptian pyramids.  It predated the Mesoamerican Olmec by nearly two millennia. While millennia of independent development were interrupted by the Portuguese and Spanish colonization of the late 15th century and the demographic collapse that followed, the continent's mestizo and indigenous cultures remain quite distinct from those of their colonizers.

Buckingham π theorem<====>51399<====>Buckingham π theoremIn engineering, applied mathematics, and physics, the Buckingham   theorem is a key theorem in dimensional analysis.   It is a formalization of Rayleigh's method of dimensional analysis.  Loosely, the theorem states that if there is a physically meaningful equation involving a certain number n of physical variables, then the original equation can be rewritten in terms of a set of p = n − k dimensionless parameters   1 ,   2 , . . . ,   p  constructed from the original variables.  (Here k is the number of physical dimensions involved; it is obtained as the rank of a particular matrix. 

Low Countries<====>51402<====>Low Countries The Low Countries or, in the geographic sense of the term, the Netherlands (  or  ,  ) is a coastal region in northwestern Europe, consisting especially of the Netherlands and Belgium, and the low-lying delta of the Rhine, Meuse, Scheldt, and Ems rivers where much of the land is at or below sea level. This wide area of Western Europe roughly stretches from the French départment Nord at its southwestern point, to German East Frisia at its northeastern point.  The Netherlands is often considered to include inland areas with strong links, such as Luxembourg today, and historically, parts of the German Rhineland. 

Half Dome<====>51408<====>Half Dome  Half Dome is a granite dome at the eastern end of Yosemite Valley in Yosemite National Park, California.  It is a well-known rock formation in the park, named for its distinct shape.  One side is a sheer face while the other three sides are smooth and round, making it appear like a dome cut in half.   The granite crest rises more than   above the valley floor. Geology The impression from the valley floor that this is a round dome that has lost its northwest half is an illusion.  From Washburn Point, Half Dome can be seen as a thin ridge of rock, an arête, that is oriented northeast-southwest, with its southeast side almost as steep as its northwest side except for the very top. 

Probability and statistics<====>51411<====>Probability and statistics  Probability and Statistics or also called Statistics and Probability are two related but separate academic disciplines. Statistical analysis often uses probability distributions, and the two topics are often studied together. However, probability theory contains much that is mostly of mathematical interest and not directly relevant to statistics. Moreover, many topics in statistics are independent of probability theory.

Fundamental theorem of algebra<====>51414<====>Fundamental theorem of algebra The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every non-constant single-variable polynomial with complex  coefficients has at least one complex root.  This includes polynomials with real coefficients, since every real number is a complex number with an imaginary part equal to zero. Equivalently (by definition), the theorem states that the field of complex numbers is algebraically closed. The theorem is also stated as follows: every non-zero, single-variable, degree n polynomial with complex coefficients has, counted with multiplicity, exactly n complex roots.  The equivalence of the two statements can be proven through the use of successive polynomial division. 

Nikos Kazantzakis<====>51418<====>Nikos Kazantzakis    Nikos Kazantzakis (   ; 18 February 1883 26 October 1957) was a Greek writer.  Widely considered a giant of modern Greek literature, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in nine different years.  Kazantzakis' novels included Zorba the Greek (published 1946 as Life and Times of Alexis Zorbas), Christ Recrucified (1948), Captain Michalis (1950, translated 'Freedom or Death), and The Last Temptation of Christ (1955).   He also wrote plays, travel books, memoirs and philosophical essays such as The Saviors of God: Spiritual Exercises.  His fame spread in the English-speaking world due to cinematic adaptations of Zorba the Greek (1964) and The Last Temptation of Christ (1988). 

Carbonic acid<====>51420<====>Carbonic acidNot to be confused with Carbolic acid, an antiquated name for phenol.  Carbonic acid  is a chemical compound with the chemical formula H 2 CO 3  (equivalently OC(OH) 2 ).  It is also a name sometimes given to solutions of carbon dioxide in water (carbonated water), because such solutions contain small amounts of H 2 CO 3 .  In physiology, carbonic acid is described as volatile acid or respiratory acid, because it is the only acid excreted as a gas by the lungs.   It plays an important role in the bicarbonate buffer system to maintain acid–base homeostasis. 

Integer sequence<====>51421<====>Integer sequenceIn mathematics, an integer sequence is a sequence (i. e. , an ordered list) of integers. An integer sequence may be specified explicitly by giving a formula for its nth term, or implicitly by giving a relationship between its terms.  For example, the sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, … (the Fibonacci sequence) is formed by starting with 0 and 1 and then adding any two consecutive terms to obtain the next one: an implicit description.  The sequence 0, 3, 8, 15, … is formed according to the formula n 2  − 1 for the nth term: an explicit definition. 

P-adic number<====>51423<====>P-adic numberDISPLAYTITLEIn mathematics, the  -adic number system for any prime number   extends the ordinary arithmetic of the rational numbers in a different  way from the extension of the rational number system to the real and complex number systems.  The extension is achieved by an alternative interpretation of the concept of "closeness" or absolute value.  In particular,  -adic numbers are considered to be close when their difference is divisible by a high power of  : the higher the power, the closer they are.  This property enables  -adic numbers to encode congruence information in a way that turns out to have powerful applications in number theory—including, for example, in the famous proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles. 

Somaliland<====>51425<====>Somaliland Somaliland ( ;    ,    ), officially the Republic of Somaliland ( ,   Jumhūrīyat Ṣūmālīlānd), is a self-declared state internationally recognised as an autonomous region of Somalia.   The government of the de facto state of Somaliland regards itself as the successor state to the former British Somaliland protectorate, which, in the form of the briefly independent State of Somaliland, united as scheduled on 1 July 1960 with the Trust Territory of Somaliland (the former Italian Somaliland) to form the Somali Republic.

Cantor's diagonal argument<====>51426<====>Cantor's diagonal argument  In set theory, Cantor's diagonal argument, also called the diagonalisation argument, the diagonal slash argument or the diagonal method, was published in 1891 by Georg Cantor as a mathematical proof that there are infinite sets which cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the infinite set of natural numbers.   Such sets are now known as uncountable sets, and the size of infinite sets is now treated by the theory of cardinal numbers which Cantor began. The diagonal argument was not Cantor's first proof of the uncountability of the real numbers, which appeared in 1874. 

British Somaliland<====>51427<====>British Somaliland   British Somaliland, officially the British Somaliland Protectorate ( ,  ) was a British protectorate in present-day northwestern Somalia.  For much of its existence, the territory was bordered by Italian Somaliland, French Somaliland and Ethiopia.  From 1940 to 1941, it was occupied by the Italians and was part of Italian East Africa.  On June 26, 1960, British Somaliland declared independence as the State of Somaliland.  On 1 July 1960, the State of Somaliland united, as scheduled, with the Trust Territory of Somaliland (the former Italian Somaliland) to form the Somali Republic (Somalia). 

Hyperreal number<====>51429<====>Hyperreal number The system of hyperreal numbers is a way of treating infinite and infinitesimal quantities.   The hyperreals, or nonstandard reals, *R, are an extension of the real numbers R that contains numbers greater than anything of the form 1 + 1 + \cdots + 1   (for any finite number of terms). Such numbers are infinite, and their reciprocals are infinitesimals.   The term "hyper-real" was introduced by Edwin Hewitt in 1948.  The hyperreal numbers satisfy the transfer principle, a rigorous version of Leibniz's heuristic Law of Continuity.   The transfer principle states that true first order statements about R are also valid in *R. 

Surreal number<====>51432<====>Surreal numberIn mathematics, the surreal number system is a totally ordered class containing the real numbers as well as infinite and infinitesimal numbers, respectively larger or smaller in absolute value than any positive real number.   The surreals share many properties with the reals, including the usual arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division); as such, they form an ordered field.   If formulated in Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory, the surreal numbers are a universal ordered field in the sense that all other ordered fields, such as the rationals, the reals, the rational functions, the Levi-Civita field, the superreal numbers, and the hyperreal numbers, can be realized as subfields of the surreals. 

Sedenion<====>51434<====>SedenionIn abstract algebra, the sedenions form a 16-dimensional noncommutative and nonassociative algebra over the reals obtained by applying the Cayley–Dickson construction to the octonions.  Unlike the octonions, the sedenions are not an alternative algebra.  The set of sedenions is denoted by  \mathbb{S} . The term sedenion is also used for other 16-dimensional algebraic structures, such as a tensor product of two copies of the biquaternions, or the algebra of 4 by 4 matrices over the reals, or that studied by  . ArithmeticLike octonions, multiplication of sedenions is neither commutative nor associative. But in contrast to the octonions, the sedenions do not even have the property of being alternative. 

Octonion<====>51436<====>OctonionIn mathematics, the octonions are a normed division algebra over the real numbers, usually represented by the capital letter O, using boldface O or blackboard bold  \mathbb O .  There are three lower-dimensional normed division algebras over the reals: the real numbers R themselves, the complex numbers C, and the quaternions H.  The octonions have eight dimensions; twice the number of dimensions of the quaternions, of which they are an extension.  They are noncommutative and nonassociative, but satisfy a weaker form of associativity, namely they are alternative. Octonions are not as well known as the quaternions and complex numbers, which are much more widely studied and used. 

Hypercomplex number<====>51438<====>Hypercomplex number  In mathematics, a hypercomplex number is a traditional term for an element of a unital algebra over the field of real numbers.  The study of hypercomplex numbers in the late 19th century forms the basis of modern group representation theory. HistoryIn the nineteenth century number systems called quaternions, tessarines, coquaternions, biquaternions, and octonions became established concepts in mathematical literature, added to the real and complex numbers.  The concept of a hypercomplex number covered them all, and called for a discipline to explain and classify them. The cataloguing project began in 1872 when Benjamin Peirce first published his Linear Associative Algebra, and was carried forward by his son Charles Sanders Peirce. 

Quaternion<====>51440<====>Quaternion Quaternion multiplication× 1 i j k 1 1 i j k i i −1 k −j j j −k −1 i k k j −i −1 In mathematics, the quaternions are a number system that extends the complex numbers.  They were first described by Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton in 1843    and applied to mechanics in three-dimensional space.  A feature of quaternions is that multiplication of two quaternions is noncommutative.  Hamilton defined a quaternion as the quotient of two directed lines in a three-dimensional space  or equivalently as the quotient of two vectors. 

Zero divisor<====>51441<====>Zero divisorIn abstract algebra, an element   of a ring   is called a left zero divisor if there exists a nonzero   such that  ,  or equivalently if the map from   to   that sends   to   is not injective.    Similarly, an element   of a ring is called a right zero divisor if there exists a nonzero   such that  .  This is a partial case of divisibility in rings.  An element that is a left or a right zero divisor is simply called a zero divisor. 

Zorn's lemma<====>51442<====>Zorn's lemma  Zorn's lemma, also known as the Kuratowski–Zorn lemma, after mathematicians Max Zorn and Kazimierz Kuratowski, is a proposition of set theory that states that a partially ordered set containing upper bounds for every chain (that is, every totally ordered subset) necessarily contains at least one maximal element. Proved by Kuratowski in 1922 and independently by Zorn in 1935,  this lemma occurs in the proofs of several theorems of crucial importance, for instance the Hahn–Banach theorem in functional analysis, the theorem that every vector space has a basis, Tychonoff's theorem in topology stating that every product of compact spaces is compact, and the theorems in abstract algebra that in a  ring  with identity every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal and that every field has an algebraic closure. 

Pythagoras' theorem<====>51451<====>Pythagoras' theorem

Singular function<====>51453<====>Singular function In mathematics, a real-valued function f on the interval [a, b] is said to be singular if it has the following properties:f is continuous on [a, b].  (**)there exists a set N of measure 0 such that for all x outside of N the derivative f ′(x) exists and is zero, that is, the derivative of f vanishes almost everywhere. f is non-constant on [a, b]. A standard example of a singular function is the Cantor function, which is sometimes called the devil's staircase (a term also used for singular functions in general).   There are, however, other functions that have been given that name. 

Mohammed Daoud Khan<====>51456<====>Mohammed Daoud Khan Mohammed Daoud Khan or Daud Khan (July 18, 1909 – April 28, 1978) was the Prime Minister of Afghanistan from 1953 to 1963 and later the President of Afghanistan.  Born into the royal family, he overthrew the Musahiban monarchy of his first cousin Mohammed Zahir Shah and declared himself as the first President of his republic in 1973 before his assassination in 1978 as a result of the Saur Revolution led by the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA).  Daoud Khan was known for his progressive policies, his efforts for the improvement of women's rights, his Pashtun nationalism, and for initiating two five-year modernization plans which increased the labor force by about 50 percent. 

AutoLISP<====>51458<====>AutoLISPAutoLISP is a dialect of the LISP programming language built specifically for use with the full version of AutoCAD and its derivatives, which include AutoCAD Map 3D, AutoCAD Architecture and AutoCAD Mechanical.Neither the application programming interface nor the interpreter to execute AutoLISP code are included in the AutoCAD LT product line.FeaturesAutoLISP is a small, dynamically scoped, dynamically typed LISP dialect with garbage collection, immutable list structure and settable symbols, lacking in such regular LISP features as macro system, records definition facilities, arrays, functions  with variable number of arguments or let bindings. 

South Platte River<====>51459<====>South Platte River  The South Platte River  is one of the two principal tributaries of the Platte River.  Flowing through the U. S.  states of Colorado and Nebraska, it is itself a major river of the American Midwest and the American Southwest/Mountain West.  Its drainage basin includes much of the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado; much of the populated region known as the Colorado Front Range and Eastern Plains; and a portion of southeastern Wyoming in the vicinity of the city of Cheyenne.   It joins the North Platte River in western Nebraska to form the Platte, which then flows across Nebraska to the Missouri. 

Machine<====>51462<====>Machine   A machine uses power to apply forces and control movement to perform an intended action.   Machines can be driven by animals and people, by natural forces such as wind and water, and by chemical, thermal, or electrical power, and include a system of mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement.   They can also include computers and sensors that monitor performance and plan movement, often called mechanical systems. Renaissance natural philosophers identified six simple machines which were the elementary devices that put a load into motion, and calculated the ratio of output force to input force, known today as mechanical advantage. 

Great Plains<====>51464<====>Great Plains    The Great Plains (sometimes simply "the Plains") is the broad expanse of flat land (a plain), much of it covered in prairie, steppe, and grassland, that lies west of the Mississippi River tallgrass prairie states and east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada.  It embracesthe entirety of the states of Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota,parts of the states of Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming and reaches into the southern portions of the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan.   The region is known for supporting extensive cattle ranching and dry farming. 

Molière<====>51465<====>Molière    Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, known by his stage name Molière (  or  ;   ; 15 January 1622 17 February 1673), was a French playwright and actor who is considered to be one of the greatest masters of comedy in Western literature.   Among Molière's best known works are The Misanthrope, The School for Wives, Tartuffe, The Miser, The Imaginary Invalid, and The Bourgeois Gentleman. Born into a prosperous family and having studied at the Collège de Clermont (now Lycée Louis-le-Grand), Molière was well suited to begin a life in the theatre.  Thirteen years as an itinerant actor helped him polish his comic abilities while he began writing, combining Commedia dell'arte elements with the more refined French comedy. 

Mold<====>51469<====>Mold   A mold ( ) or mould (  is a fungus that grows in the form of multicellular filaments called hyphae.   In contrast, fungi that can adopt a single-celled growth habit are called yeasts. Molds are a large and taxonomically diverse number of fungal species in which the growth of hyphae results in discoloration and a fuzzy appearance, especially on food.   The network of these tubular branching hyphae, called a mycelium, is considered a single organism.  The hyphae are generally transparent, so the mycelium appears like very fine, fluffy white threads over the surface. 

Mycelium<====>51470<====>Mycelium Mycelium is the vegetative part of a fungus or fungus-like bacterial colony, consisting of a mass of branching, thread-like hyphae.  The mass of hyphae is sometimes called shiro, especially within the fairy ring fungi.  Fungal colonies composed of mycelium are found in and on soil and many other substrates.  A typical single spore germinates into a homokaryotic mycelium, which cannot reproduce sexually; when two compatible homokaryotic mycelia join and form a dikaryotic mycelium, that mycelium may form fruiting bodies such as mushrooms.  A mycelium may be minute, forming a colony that is too small to see, or it may be extensive: Through the mycelium, a fungus absorbs nutrients from its environment. 

Spore<====>51472<====>Spore  In biology, a spore is a unit of sexual or asexual reproduction that may be adapted for dispersal and for survival, often for extended periods of time, in unfavourable conditions.  Spores form part of the life cycles of many plants, algae, fungi and protozoa.   Bacterial spores are not part of a sexual cycle but are resistant structures used for survival under unfavourable conditions.  Myxozoan spores release amoebulae into their hosts for parasitic infection, but also reproduce within the hosts through the pairing of two nuclei within the plasmodium, which develops from the amoebula.  Spores are usually haploid and unicellular and are produced by meiosis in the sporangium of a diploid sporophyte. 

Seat belt<====>51474<====>Seat belt  A seat belt (also known as a seatbelt or safety belt) is a vehicle safety device designed to secure the occupant of a vehicle against harmful movement that may result during a collision or a sudden stop.  A seat belt functions to reduce the likelihood of death or serious injury in a traffic collision by reducing the force of secondary impacts with interior strike hazards, by keeping occupants positioned correctly for maximum effectiveness of the airbag (if equipped) and by preventing occupants being ejected from the vehicle in a crash or if the vehicle rolls over. 

Rolf Singer<====>51478<====>Rolf Singer  Rolf Singer (June 23, 1906 – January 18, 1994) was a German-born mycologist and one of the most important taxonomists of gilled mushrooms (agarics) in the 20th century. After receiving his Ph. D.  at the University of Vienna in 1931 he worked in Munich.  By 1933, however, Singer was forced to flee Nazi Germany to Vienna due to being Jewish .  There he met his wife, Martha Singer.  From Vienna, Singer and his wife went to Barcelona, Spain, where Singer was appointed Assistant Professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona.  Persecution by the Spanish authorities on behalf of the German government forced Singer to leave Spain for France in 1934. 

Hypha<====>51480<====>Hypha  A hypha (plural hyphae, from Greek  , huphḗ, “web”) is a long, branching filamentous structure of a fungus, oomycete, or actinobacterium.In most fungi, hyphae are the main mode of vegetative growth, and are collectively called a mycelium.  StructureA hypha consists of one or more cells surrounded by a tubular cell wall.   In most fungi, hyphae are divided into cells by internal cross-walls called "septa" (singular septum).  Septa are usually perforated by pores large enough for ribosomes, mitochondria and sometimes nuclei to flow between cells.  The major structural polymer in fungal cell walls is typically chitin, in contrast to plants and oomycetes that have cellulosic cell walls. 

Jurist<====>51481<====>Jurist  A jurist (from medieval Latin) is someone who researches and studies jurisprudence (theory of law).Such a person can work as an academic, legal writer or law lecturer.   In the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and in many other Commonwealth countries, the word jurist sometimes refers to a barrister, whereas in the United States of America and Canada it often refers to a judge.   Thus a jurist, someone who studies, analyses and comments on law,  stands in contrast with a lawyer, someone who applies law on behalf of clients and thinks about it in practical terms. 

Mutualism (biology)<====>51483<====>Mutualism (biology) Mutualism is the way two organisms of different species exist in a relationship in which each individual benefits from the activity of the other.  Similar interactions within a species are known as co-operation.  Mutualism can be contrasted with interspecific competition, in which each species experiences reduced fitness, and exploitation, or parasitism, in which one species benefits at the "expense" of the other.  Symbiosis involves two species living in close proximity and includes relationships that are mutualistic, parasitic, and commensal.   Symbiotic relationships are sometimes, but not always, mutualistic. A well-known mutualism is the relationship between ungulates (such as bovines) and bacteria within their intestines. 

German Workers' Party<====>51485<====>German Workers' Party  The German Workers' Party ( , DAP) was a short-lived political party established in Weimar Germany after World War I.  It was the precursor of the Nazi Party, which was officially known as the National Socialist German Workers' Party ( , NSDAP).  The DAP only lasted from January 1919 until February 1920. OriginsThe DAP was founded in Munich in the hotel "Fürstenfelder Hof" on January 5, 1919 by Anton Drexler.   It developed out of the Freier Arbeiterausschuss für einen guten Frieden (Free Workers' Committee for a Good Peace) league, a branch of which Drexler had founded in 1918. 

Salvador Allende<====>51487<====>Salvador Allende    Salvador Guillermo Allende Gossens  ( ; 26 June 1908 – 11 September 1973) was a Chilean physician and politician, known as the first Marxist to become president of a Latin American country through open elections.    Allende's involvement in Chilean political life spanned a period of nearly forty years.  As a member of the Socialist Party, he was a senator, deputy and cabinet minister.  He unsuccessfully ran for the presidency in the 1952, 1958, and 1964 elections.  In 1970, he won the presidency in a close three-way race.  He was elected in a run-off by Congress as no candidate had gained a majority. 

Poitiers<====>51489<====>Poitiers  Poitiers ( ) is a city on the Clain river in west-central France.  It is a commune and the capital of the Vienne department and also of the Poitou.  Poitiers is a major university centre.  The centre of town is picturesque and its streets include predominantly historical architecture, especially religious architecture and especially from the Romanesque period.  Two major military battles took place near the city: in 732, the Battle of Poitiers (also known as the Battle of Tours), in which the Franks commanded by Charles Martel halted the expansion of the Umayyad Caliphate, and in 1356, the Battle of Poitiers, a key victory for the English forces during the Hundred Years' War. 

Rights<====>51490<====>Rights  Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory.   Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology.  Rights are often considered fundamental to civilization, for they are regarded as established pillars of society and culture,  and the history of social conflicts can be found in the history of each right and its development.  According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived". 

Samarkand<====>51491<====>Samarkand {{Infobox settlement  }}Samarkand (Uzbek Latin:  ; Uzbek Cyrillic and  ;  ;  ), alternatively Samarqand or Samarcand, is a city in modern-day Uzbekistan and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Central Asia.  There is evidence of human activity in the area of the city from the late Paleolithic era, though there is no direct evidence of when exactly Samarkand was founded; some theories propose that it was founded between the 8th and 7th centuries BC.  Prospering from its location on the Silk Road between China and the Mediterranean, at times Samarkand was one of the greatest cities of Central Asia. 

Battle of Verdun<====>51497<====>Battle of Verdun  The Battle of Verdun (   ,    ), fought from 21 February to 18 December 1916, was the largest and longest battle of the First World War on the Western Front between the German and French armies.  The battle took place on the hills north of Verdun-sur-Meuse in north-eastern France.  The German 5th Army attacked the defences of the Fortified Region of Verdun (RFV, Région Fortifiée de Verdun) and those of the French Second Army on the right bank of the Meuse.  Inspired by the experience of the Second Battle of Champagne in 1915, the Germans planned rapidly to capture the Meuse Heights, an excellent defensive position with good observation for the artillery to bombard Verdun. 

Western Front (World War I)<====>51499<====>Western Front (World War I) The Western Front was the main theatre of war during the First World War.  Following the outbreak of war in August 1914, the German Army opened the Western Front by invading Luxembourg and Belgium, then gaining military control of important industrial regions in France.  The tide of the advance was dramatically turned with the Battle of the Marne.  Following the Race to the Sea, both sides dug in along a meandering line of fortified trenches, stretching from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier with France, which changed little except during early 1917 and in 1918. 

Progressive rock<====>51503<====>Progressive rock   Progressive rock (shortened as prog; sometimes called art rock, classical rock or symphonic rock)  is a broad subgenre of rock music  that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s.  Initially termed "progressive pop", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk, or classical music.  Additional elements contributed to its "progressive" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of "art", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. 

Dell Hymes<====>51504<====>Dell HymesDell Hathaway Hymes (June 7, 1927 in Portland, Oregon November 13, 2009 in Charlottesville, Virginia) was a linguist, sociolinguist, anthropologist, and folklorist who established disciplinary foundations for the comparative, ethnographic study of language use.  His research focused upon the languages of the Pacific Northwest.  He was one of the first to call the fourth subfield of anthropology "linguistic anthropology" instead of "anthropological linguistics".  The terminological shift draws attention to the field's grounding in anthropology rather than in what, by that time, had already become an autonomous discipline (linguistics).  In 1972 Hymes founded the journal Language in Society and served as its editor for 22 years. 

County seat<====>51509<====>County seatA county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish.  The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, Mainland China, and Taiwan.  County towns have a similar function in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, and historically in Jamaica. FunctionIn the United States, counties are the political subdivisions of a state.   Depending on the state, counties may provide certain services to the public, impose taxes, and administer and enforce selected state laws and regulations as well as a court system (or provide regional boundaries for a state court system). 

Silk<====>51510<====>SilkSilk is a natural protein fiber, some forms of which can be woven into textiles.  The protein fiber of silk is composed mainly of fibroin and is produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons.   The best-known silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombyx mori reared in captivity (sericulture).  The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism-like structure of the silk fibre, which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles, thus producing different colors. Silk is produced by several insects, like silk worms but generally only the silk of moth caterpillars has been used for textile manufacturing. 

Prince<====>51511<====>Prince   A prince is a male ruler or member of a monarch's or former monarch's family.  Prince is also a title of  nobility, often hereditary, in some European states.  The feminine equivalent is a princess.  The English word derives, via the French word prince, from the Latin noun princeps, from primus (first) + capio (to seize), meaning "the chief, most distinguished, ruler, prince".  Historical background The Latin word prīnceps (older Latin *prīsmo-kaps, literally "the one who takes the first [place/position]"), became the usual title of the informal leader of the Roman senate some centuries before the transition to empire, the princeps senatus. 

Etiquette<====>51512<====>Etiquette Etiquette (  or  ,  ) is a code of behavior that delineates expectations for social behavior according to contemporary conventional norms within a society, social class, or group. The French word  , literally signifying a tag or label, was used in a modern sense in English around 1750.   Etiquette has changed and evolved over the years. HistoryIn the 3rd millennium BC, Ptahhotep wrote The Maxims of Ptahhotep.  The Maxims were conformist precepts extolling such civil virtues as truthfulness, self-control and kindness towards one's fellow beings.  Learning by listening to everybody and knowing that human knowledge is never perfect are a leitmotif. 

Arrow<====>51513<====>Arrow  An arrow is a fin-stabilized projectile that is shot with a bow, and usually consists of a long straight shaft with a weighty and usually pointed arrowhead attached to the front end, with fletchings and a nock at the rear end.   The use of bows and arrows by humans predates recorded history and is common to most cultures. History The oldest evidence of stone-tipped projectiles, which may or may not have been propelled by a bow (c. f.  atlatl), dating to c.  64,000 years ago, were found in Sibudu Cave, current South Africa.  The oldest evidence of the use of bows to shoot arrows dates to about 10,000 years ago; it is based on pinewood arrows found in the Ahrensburg valley north of Hamburg. 

Dam<====>51518<====>Dam  A dam is a barrier that stops or restricts the flow of water or underground streams.  Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such  as irrigation, human consumption, industrial use, aquaculture, and navigability.  Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity.  A dam can also be used to collect water or for storage of water which can be evenly distributed between locations.  Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water, while other structures such as floodgates or levees (also known as dikes) are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions. 

Pratt & Whitney<====>51519<====>Pratt & Whitney   Pratt & Whitney is an American aerospace manufacturer with global service operations.  It is a subsidiary of United Technologies (UTC).  Pratt & Whitney's aircraft engines are widely used in both civil aviation (especially airlines) and military aviation.  Its headquarters are in East Hartford, Connecticut.   As one of the "big three" aero-engine manufacturers, it competes with General Electric and Rolls-Royce, although it has also formed joint ventures with both of these companies.  In addition to aircraft engines, Pratt & Whitney manufactures gas turbines for industrial and power generation, and marine turbines. 

Low-density lipoprotein<====>51521<====>Low-density lipoprotein Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) are one of the five major groups of lipoprotein which transport all fat molecules around the body in the extracellular water.   These groups, from least dense, compared to surrounding water, (largest particles) to most dense (smallest particles), are chylomicrons (aka ULDL by the overall density naming convention), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein (HDL).  LDL delivers fat molecules to the cells and can drive the progression of atherosclerosis if they become oxidized within the walls of arteries. OverviewLipoproteins transfer lipids (fats) around the body in the extracellular fluid thereby facilitating fats to be available and up by the cells body wide via receptor-mediated endocytosis. 

Fokker<====>51522<====>Fokker   Fokker was a Dutch aircraft manufacturer named after its founder, Anthony Fokker.  The company operated under several different names, starting out in 1912 in Schwerin, Germany, moving to the Netherlands in 1919. During its most successful period in the 1920s and 1930s, it dominated the civil aviation market.  Fokker went into bankruptcy in 1996, and its operations were sold to competitors. HistoryFokker in GermanyAt age 20, while studying in Germany, Anthony Fokker built his initial aircraft, the Spin (Spider)—the first Dutch-built plane to fly in his home country.  Taking advantage of better opportunities in Germany, he moved to Berlin, where in 1912, he founded his first company, Fokker Aeroplanbau, later moving to the Görries suburb just southwest of Schwerin (at  ), where the current company was founded, as Fokker Aviatik GmbH, on 12 February 1912. 

The Pink Panther<====>51524<====>The Pink Panther   The Pink Panther is a series of comedy-mystery films featuring an inept French police detective, Inspector Jacques Clouseau.  The series began with the release of The Pink Panther (1963).  The role of Clouseau was originated by, and is most closely associated with, Peter Sellers.  Most of the films were written and directed by Blake Edwards, with theme music composed by Henry Mancini.  Elements and characters inspired by the films were adapted into other media, including books, comic books and animated series. The first film in the series derives its name from the eponymous pink diamond that has an enormous size and value. 

Haganah<====>51525<====>Haganah Haganah ( , lit.  The Defence) was a Jewish paramilitary organization in  the British Mandate of Palestine (1921–48), which became the core of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). HistoryOverviewThe evolution of Jewish defense organisations in Palestine and later Israel went from small self-defense groups active during Ottoman rule, to ever larger and more sophisticated ones during the British Mandate, leading through the Haganah to the national army of Israel, the IDF.  The evolution went step by step from Bar-Giora, to Hashomer, to Haganah, to IDF. The Jewish paramilitary organisations in the New Yishuv (the Zionist enterprise in Palestine) started with the Second Aliyah (1904 to 1914). 

Heinrich Anton de Bary<====>51526<====>Heinrich Anton de Bary  Heinrich Anton de Bary (26 January 1831 19 January 1888) was a German surgeon, botanist, microbiologist, and mycologist (fungal systematics and physiology). He is considered a founding father of plant pathology (phytopathology) as well as the founder of modern mycology.  His extensive and careful studies of the life history of fungi and contribution to the understanding of algae and higher plants were landmarks of biology. BiographyBorn in Frankfurt, Anton de Bary was one of ten children born to physician August Theodor de Bary (1802–1873) and Emilie Meyer de Bary.  His father encouraged him to join the excursions of the active group of naturalists who collected specimens in the nearby countryside. 

Elias Magnus Fries<====>51527<====>Elias Magnus Fries  Elias Magnus Fries FRS FRSE FLS RAS (15 August 1794 – 8 February 1878) was a Swedish mycologist and botanist. CareerFries was born at Femsjö (Hylte Municipality), Småland, the son of the pastor there.   He attended school in Wexio. He acquired an extensive knowledge of flowering plants from his father.  In 1811 Fries entered Lund University  where he obtained a doctorate in 1814.  In the same year he was appointed an associate professorship in botany.  He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and in 1824, became a full professor. 

Christiaan Hendrik Persoon<====>51528<====>Christiaan Hendrik Persoon  Christiaan Hendrik Persoon (1 February 1761 – 16 November 1836) was a mycologist who made additions to Linnaeus' mushroom taxonomy. Early lifePersoon was born in South Africa at the Cape of Good Hope, the third child of an immigrant Pomeranian father and Dutch mother.   His mother died soon after he was born; at the age of thirteen his father (who died a year later) sent him to Europe for his education. EducationInitially studying theology at Halle, at age 22 (in 1784) Persoon switched to medicine at Leiden and Göttingen.  He received a doctorate from the "Kaiserlich-Leopoldinisch-Carolinische Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher" in 1799. 

Tera-<====>51530<====>Tera-  Tera is a unit prefix in the metric system denoting multiplication by 10 12  or   (one trillion short scale; one billion long scale).  It has the symbol T.  Tera is derived from Greek word    , meaning "monster".   The unit prefix was confirmed for use in the International System of Units (SI) in 1960. Examples of its use:terahertz radiation: electromagnetic waves within the band of frequencies from 0. 3 to 3 THz.  Visible light is around 500 THz. terabit, tebibit, terabyte and tebibyte, units used in data storage. teragram: equal to 10 9  kg. 

Geostatistics<====>51531<====>Geostatistics  Geostatistics is a branch of statistics focusing on spatial or spatiotemporal datasets.  Developed originally to predict probability distributions of ore grades for mining operations,  it is currently applied in diverse disciplines including petroleum geology, hydrogeology, hydrology, meteorology, oceanography, geochemistry, geometallurgy, geography, forestry, environmental control, landscape ecology, soil science, and agriculture (esp.  in precision farming).  Geostatistics is applied in varied branches of geography, particularly those involving the spread of diseases (epidemiology), the practice of commerce and military planning (logistics), and the development of efficient spatial networks.  Geostatistical algorithms are incorporated in many places, including geographic information systems (GIS) and the R statistical environment  . 

Brenner Pass<====>51534<====>Brenner Pass  Brenner Pass (   ;    ) is a mountain pass through the Alps which forms the border between Italy and Austria.  It is one of the principal passes of the Eastern Alpine range and has the lowest altitude among Alpine passes of the area. Dairy cattle graze in alpine pastures throughout the summer in valleys beneath the pass and on the mountains above it.  At lower altitudes, farmers log pine trees, plant crops and harvest hay for winter fodder.  Many of the high pastures are at an altitude of over  ; a small number of them stands high in the mountains at around  . 

Hydraulic fill<====>51537<====>Hydraulic fill  A hydraulic fill is an embankment or other fill in which the materials are deposited in place by a flowing stream of water, with the deposition being selective.    Gravity, coupled with velocity control, is used to effect the selected deposition of the material. Borrow pits containing suitable material are accessible at an elevation such that the earth can be sluiced to the fill after being washed from the bank by high-pressure nozzles.  Hydraulic fill is likely to be the most economic method of construction.  Even when the source material lacks sufficient elevation, it can be elevated to the sluice by a dredge pump. 

Category 5 cable<====>51538<====>Category 5 cableCategory 5 cable, commonly referred to as Cat 5, is a twisted pair cable for computer networks.  The cable standard provides performance of up to 100 MHz and is suitable for most varieties of Ethernet over twisted pair.  Cat 5 is also used to carry other signals such as telephony and video. This cable is commonly connected using punch-down blocks and modular connectors.  Most Category 5 cables are unshielded, relying on the balanced line twisted pair design and differential signaling for noise rejection. The category 5 specification was deprecated in 2001 and is superseded by the category 5e specification. Cable standardThe specification for category 5 cable was defined in ANSI/TIA/EIA-568-A, with clarification in TSB-95. 

Washington County, New York<====>51541<====>Washington County, New York   Washington County is a county in the U. S.  state of New York.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 63,216.The county seat is Fort Edward.The county was named for President George Washington. Washington County is part of the Glens Falls, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Albany-Schenectady, NY Combined Statistical Area. HistoryWhen counties were established in New York State in 1683, the present Washington County was part of Albany County.  This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present state of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean.

Phonetic complement<====>51543<====>Phonetic complementA phonetic complement is a phonetic symbol used to disambiguate word characters (logograms) that have multiple readings, in mixed logographic-phonetic scripts such as Egyptian hieroglyphs, Akkadian cuneiform, Japanese, and Mayan.   Often they reenforce the communication of the ideogram by repeating the first or last syllable in the term. Written English has few logograms, primarily numerals, and therefore few phonetic complements.  An example is the nd of 2nd 'second', which avoids ambiguity with 2 standing for the word 'two'.  In addition to numerals, other examples include Xmas, Xianity, and   for Christmas, Christianity, and Crossing  – note the separate readings Christ and Cross. 

Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol<====>51544<====>Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing ProtocolEnhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is an advanced distance-vector routing protocol that is used on a computer network for automating routing decisions and configuration.  The protocol was designed by Cisco Systems as a proprietary protocol, available only on Cisco routers.  Partial functionality of EIGRP was converted to an open standard in 2013  and was published with informational status as   in 2016. EIGRP is used on a router to share routes with other routers within the same autonomous system.  Unlike other well known routing protocols, such as RIP, EIGRP only sends incremental updates, reducing the workload on the router and the amount of data that needs to be transmitted. 

Biblical Elam<====>51546<====>Biblical ElamElam ( ;    ‘Êlām) in the Hebrew Bible (Genesis 10:22, Ezra 4:9;) is said to be one of the sons of Shem, the son of Noah.   It is also used (as in Akkadian), for the ancient country of Elam in what is now southern Iran, whose people the Hebrews believed to be the offspring of Elam,  son of Shem (Genesis 10:22).  This implies that the Elamites were considered Semites by the Hebrews.  Their language was not one of the Semitic languages, but is considered a linguistic isolate.  Elam (the nation) is also mentioned in Genesis 14, describing an ancient war in the time of Abraham, involving a king of Elam it calls Chedorlaomer. 

United States Post Office Department<====>51547<====>United States Post Office Department  The Post Office Department (1792–1971) was the predecessor of the United States Postal Service, in the form of a Cabinet department officially from 1872 to 1971.  It was headed by the Postmaster General. The Postal Service Act signed by President George Washington on February 20, 1792, established the Department.  Postmaster General John McLean, in office from 1823 to 1829, was the first to call it the Post Office Department rather than just the "Post Office. " The organization received a boost in prestige when President Andrew Jackson invited his Postmaster General, William T. 

Montreux<====>51548<====>Montreux  Montreux ( ) is a municipality in the district of Riviera-Pays-d'Enhaut in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland.

HistoryThe earliest settlement was a Late Bronze Age village at Baugy.   Montreux lies on the north east shore of Lake Geneva at the fork in the Roman road from Italy over the Simplon Pass, where the roads to the Roman capital of Aventicum and the road into Gaul through Besançon separated. 

Postal code<====>51549<====>Postal code  A postal code (also known locally in various English-speaking countries throughout the world as a postcode, post code, Eircode, PIN Code or ZIP Code) is a series of letters or digits or both, sometimes including spaces or punctuation, included in a postal address for the purpose of sorting mail. In February 2005, 117 of the 190 member countries of the Universal Postal Union had postal code systems. Although postal codes are usually assigned to geographical areas, special codes are sometimes assigned to individual addresses or to institutions that receive large volumes of mail, such as government agencies and large commercial companies. 

ZIP Code<====>51550<====>ZIP Code ZIP Codes are a system of postal codes used by the United States Postal Service since 1963.  The term ZIP is an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan;  it was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently and quickly ( ) when senders use the code in the postal address.  The basic format consists of five digits.  An extended 'ZIP+4' code was introduced in 1983 which includes the five digits of the ZIP Code, followed by a hyphen and four additional digits that determine a more specific location. The term ZIP Code was originally registered as a servicemark by the U.

Rhineland<====>51556<====>Rhineland   The Rhineland ( ,  ) is the name used for a loosely defined area of Western Germany along the Rhine, chiefly its middle section. TermHistorically, the Rhinelands  refers (physically speaking) to a loosely defined region embracing the land on the banks of the  Rhine in Central Europe, which were settled by Ripuarian and Salian Franks and became part of Frankish Austrasia.  In the High Middle Ages, numerous Imperial States along the river emerged from the former stem duchy of Lotharingia, without developing any common political or cultural identity. A "Rhineland" conceptualization did not evolve until the 19th century after the War of the First Coalition, when a short-lived Cisrhenian Republic was established on territory conquered by French troops.

The film centres on a mentally tormented chess grandmaster and the young woman he meets while competing at a world-class tournament in Italy.  The screenplay was based on the novel The Defense (or The Luzhin Defence) by Vladimir Nabokov. Emily Watson received best actress nominations at the British Independent Film Awards and the London Film Critics Circle Awards. PlotIt's the early 1920s and Aleksandr Ivanovich 'Sascha' Luzhin (Turturro), a gifted but tormented chess player, arrives in a Northern Italian city to compete in an international chess competition. 

Cnidocyte<====>51567<====>Cnidocyte A cnidocyte (also known as a cnidoblast or nematocyte) is an explosive cell containing one giant secretory organelle or cnida (plural cnidae) that defines the phylum Cnidaria (corals, sea anemones, hydrae, jellyfish, etc. ).   Cnidae are used for prey capture and defense from predators.   Despite being morphologically simple, lacking a skeleton and many species being sessile, cnidarians prey on fish and crustaceans.  A cnidocyte fires a structure that contains the toxin, from a characteristic subcellular organelle called a cnidocyst (also known as a cnida or nematocyst).   This is responsible for the stings delivered by a cnidarian.

Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston 1997. or iridiagnosis ) is an alternative medicine technique whose proponents claim that patterns, colors, and other characteristics of the iris can be examined to determine information about a patient's systemic health.  Practitioners match their observations to iris charts, which divide the iris into zones that correspond to specific parts of the human body.  Iridologists see the eyes as "windows" into the body's state of health. Iridologists claim they can use the charts to distinguish between healthy systems and organs in the body and those that are overactive, inflamed, or distressed. 

Referendum<====>51582<====>Referendum A referendum (plural referendums, or  ) is a direct vote in which an entire electorate is invited to vote on a particular proposal.  This may result in the adoption of a new law.  In some countries, it is synonymous with a plebiscite or a vote on a ballot question. Some definitions of 'plebiscite' suggest that it is a type of vote to change the constitution or government of a country.   However, some other countries define it differently.  For example,  Australia defines 'referendum' as a vote to change the constitution, and 'plebiscite' as a vote that does not affect the constitution.

Sketch comedy<====>51610<====>Sketch comedy  Sketch comedy comprises a series of short comedy scenes or vignettes, called "sketches", commonly between one and ten minutes long.  Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television.  Often sketches are first improvised by the actors and written down based on the outcome of these improv sessions; however, such improvisation is not necessarily involved in sketch comedy. An individual comedy sketch is a brief scene or vignette of the type formerly used in vaudeville, and now used widely in comedy and variety shows, talk shows and some children's television series (such as Sesame Street).

Biology and sexual orientation<====>51614<====>Biology and sexual orientation The relationship between biology and sexual orientation is a subject of research.  A simple and singular determinant for sexual orientation has not been conclusively demonstrated; various studies point to different, even conflicting positions, but scientists hypothesize that a combination of genetic, hormonal, and social factors determine sexual orientation.Biological theories for explaining the causes of sexual orientation are favored by experts  and involve a complex interplay of genetic factors, the early uterine environment and brain structure.These factors, which may be related to the development of a heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual or asexual orientation, include genes, prenatal hormones, and brain structure. 

Montgolfier brothers<====>51621<====>Montgolfier brothers    Joseph-Michel Montgolfier (26 August 1740 – 26 June 1810) and Jacques-Étienne Montgolfier  (6 January 1745 – 2 August 1799) were paper manufacturers from Annonay, in Ardèche, France best known as inventors of the Montgolfière-style hot air balloon, globe aérostatique.  They launched the first piloted ascent, carrying Étienne.  Joseph Michel also invented the self-acting hydraulic ram (1796), Jacques Étienne founded the first paper-making vocational school and the brothers invented a process to manufacture transparent paper.

Young made notable scientific contributions to the fields of vision, light, solid mechanics, energy, physiology, language, musical harmony, and Egyptology.  He "made a number of original and insightful innovations"  in the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs (specifically the Rosetta Stone) before Jean-François Champollion eventually expanded on his work.  He was mentioned by, among others, William Herschel, Hermann von Helmholtz, James Clerk Maxwell, and Albert Einstein.  Young has been described as "The Last Man Who Knew Everything". 

Pelagius of Asturias<====>51626<====>Pelagius of AsturiasPelagius ( ,  ; c.  685 – 737) was a Visigothic nobleman  who founded the Kingdom of Asturias, ruling it from 718 until his death.  Through his victory at the Battle of Covadonga, he is credited with beginning the Reconquista, the Christian reconquest of the Iberian peninsula from the Moors.  He established an independent Christian state in opposition to Moorish hegemony. The chief sources for Pelagius's life and career are two Latin chronicles written in the late ninth century in the kingdom he founded.  The first is the Chronica Albeldensia, written at Albelda towards 881, and preserved in the Codex Vigilanus, with a continuation to 976. 

Sweet potato<====>51628<====>Sweet potato   The sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) is a dicotyledonous plant that belongs to the bindweed or morning glory family, Convolvulaceae.   Its large, starchy, sweet-tasting, tuberous roots are a root vegetable.    The young leaves and shoots are sometimes eaten as greens.  The sweet potato is only distantly related to the potato (Solanum tuberosum) and does not belong to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, but both families belong to the same taxonomic order, the Solanales. The plant is a herbaceous perennial vine, bearing alternate heart-shaped or palmately lobed leaves and medium-sized sympetalous flowers. 

Pulse-amplitude modulation<====>51630<====>Pulse-amplitude modulation Pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM), is a form of signal modulation where the message information is encoded in the amplitude of a series of signal pulse.  It is an analog pulse modulation scheme in which the amplitudes of a train of carrier pulses are varied according to the sample value of the message signal. Demodulation is performed by detecting the amplitude level of the carrier at every single period. TypesThere are two types of pulse amplitude modulation:Single polarity PAM: In this a suitable fixed DC bias is added to the signal to ensure that all the pulses are positive. 

Puffball<====>51632<====>Puffball  A puffball is a member of any of several groups of fungi in the division Basidiomycota.  The puffballs were previously treated as a taxonomic group called the Gasteromycetes or Gasteromycetidae, but they are now known to be a polyphyletic assemblage.  The distinguishing feature of all puffballs is that they do not have an open cap with spore-bearing gills.  Instead, spores are produced internally, in a spheroidal fruitbody called a gasterothecium (gasteroid ('stomach-like') basidiocarp).  As the spores mature, they form a mass called a gleba in the centre of the fruitbody that is often of a distinctive color and texture. 

Mens rea<====>51634<====>Mens rea  Mens rea ( ; Law Latin for "guilty mind"   ) is the mental element of 1) intention to commit a crime or 2) knowledge that one's action or lack of action would cause a crime to be committed.  It is a necessary element of many crimes. The standard common law test of criminal liability is expressed in the Latin phrase actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea, i. e.  "the act is not culpable unless the mind is guilty".  In jurisdictions with due process, there must be both actus reus ("guilty act") and mens rea for a defendant to be guilty of a crime (see concurrence). 

Geastrales<====>51640<====>Geastrales  Geastrales is an order of gasterocarpic basidiomycetes (fungi) that are related to Cantharellales.  The order contains the single family Geastraceae, commonly known as "earthstars", which older classifications had placed in Lycoperdales, or Phallales.   Approximately 64 species are classified in this family, divided among eight genera, including the Geastrum, Myriostoma and Sphaerobolus.   The Sphaerobolus are known as "shotgun fungus" or "cannonball fungus".  They colonize wood-based mulches and may throw black, sticky, spore-containing globs onto nearby surfaces.   The fruiting bodies of several earthstars are hygroscopic: in dry weather the "petals" will dry and curl up around the soft spore sac, protecting it. 

Pet Shop Boys<====>51641<====>Pet Shop Boys   Pet Shop Boys are an English synthpop duo, formed in London in 1981 and consisting of Neil Tennant (lead vocals, keyboards, occasional guitar) and Chris Lowe (keyboards, vocals).

Burali-Forti paradox<====>51653<====>Burali-Forti paradoxIn set theory, a field of mathematics, the Burali-Forti paradox demonstrates that constructing "the set of all ordinal numbers" leads to a contradiction and therefore shows an antinomy in a system that allows its construction.  It is named after Cesare Burali-Forti, who in 1897 published a paper proving a theorem which, unknown to him, contradicted a previously proved result by Cantor.  Bertrand Russell subsequently noticed the contradiction, and when he published it in his 1903 book "Principles of Mathematics", he stated that it had been suggested to him by Burali-Forti's paper, with the result that it came to be known by Burali-Forti's name. 

Soliton<====>51654<====>Soliton In mathematics and physics, a soliton is a self-reinforcing solitary wave packet that maintains its shape while it propagates at a constant velocity.  Solitons are caused by a cancellation of nonlinear and dispersive effects in the medium.  (The term "dispersive effects" refers to a property of certain systems where the speed of the waves varies according to frequency. ) Solitons are the solutions of a widespread class of weakly nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations describing physical systems. The soliton phenomenon was first described in 1834 by John Scott Russell (1808–1882) who observed a solitary wave in the Union Canal in Scotland. 

Severn bore<====>51655<====>Severn bore   The Severn bore is a tidal bore seen on the tidal reaches of the River Severn in south western England.  It is formed when the rising tide moves into the funnel-shaped Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary and the surging water forces its way upstream in a series of waves, as far as Gloucester and beyond.  The bore behaves differently in different stretches of the river; in the lower, wider parts it is more noticeable in the deep channels as a slight roller, while the water creeps across the sand and mudflats.  In the narrower, upper reaches, the river occupies the whole area between its banks and the bore advances in a series of waves that move upstream. 

Limey<====>51661<====>Limey  Limey is a predominantly North American slang nickname for the British people, originally referring to their sailors.   Oxford Dictionaries: Limey  Retrieved 2011-07-06 HistoryThe term is thought to have originated in the 1850s as lime-juicer , later shortened to "limey"   , and originally used as a derogatory word for sailors in the British Royal Navy.  Since the beginning of the 19th century it had been the practice of the Royal Navy of adding lemon juice to the sailors' daily ration of grog (watered-down rum).  The vitamin C (specifically   acid) in citrus fruits prevented scurvy  (see James Lind), and helped to make these sailors some of the healthiest of the time.

Semivariance<====>51666<====>SemivarianceFor the measure of downside risk, see VarianceIn spatial statistics, the empirical semivariance is described by \hat\gamma(h)=\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{n(h)}\sum_{i=1}^{n(h)}(z(x_i+h)-z(x_i))^2 where z is a datum at a particular location, h is the distance between ordered data, and n(h) is the number of paired data at a distance of h.  The semivariance is half the variance of the increments  z(x_i+h)-z(x_i) , but the whole variance of z-values at given separation distance h (Bachmaier and Backes, 2008). A plot of semivariances versus distances between ordered data in a graph is known as a semivariogram rather than a variogram.  Many authors call  2\hat\gamma(h)  a variogram, others use the terms variogram and semivariogram synonymously. 

Shoot<====>51668<====>Shoot In botany, shoots  consist of stems including their appendages, the leaves and lateral buds, flowering stems and flower buds.    The new growth from seed germination that grows upward is a shoot where leaves will develop.   In the spring, perennial plant shoots are the new growth that grows from the ground in herbaceous plants or the new stem or flower growth that grows on woody plants. In everyday speech, shoots are often synonymous with stems.  Stems, which are an integral component of shoots, provide an axis for buds, fruits, and leaves. 

Aryan Nations<====>51669<====>Aryan Nations Aryan Nations is a white supremacist    religious organization originally based in Hayden, Idaho.  Richard Girnt Butler founded the group in the 1970s, as an arm of the Christian Identity organization Church of Jesus Christ–Christian.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation has called Aryan Nations a "terrorist threat",  and the RAND Corporation has called it the "first truly nationwide terrorist network" in the United States.  HistoryThe origin of Aryan Nations is in the teachings of Wesley A.  Swift, a significant figure in the early Christian Identity movement.   Swift combined British Israelism, extreme antisemitism and political militancy. 

Quatorzain<====>51671<====>Quatorzain A quatorzain (from  Italian quattordici or French quatorze, fourteen) is a poem of fourteen lines.  Historically the term has often been used interchangeably with the term 'sonnet'.  Various writers have tried to draw distinctions between 'true' sonnets, and quatorzains. Nowadays the term is seldom used, and when it is, it usually is used to distinguish fourteen line poems that do not follow the various rules that describe the sonnet.See alsoSonnetFourteenerBref doubleReferencesOxford English DictionaryFurther reading 

Vacuous truth<====>51672<====>Vacuous truthIn mathematics and logic, a vacuous truth is a statement that asserts that all members of the empty set have a certain property.  For example, the statement "all cell phones in the room are turned off" will be true whenever there are no cell phones in the room.  In this case, the statement "all cell phones in the room are turned on" would also be vacuously true, as would the conjunction of the two: "all cell phones in the room are turned on and turned off". More formally, a relatively well-defined usage refers to a conditional statement with a false antecedent.

Hurrians<====>51681<====>Hurrians  The Hurrians ( ; cuneiform:  ; transliteration: Ḫu-ur-ri; also called Hari, Khurrites, Hourri, Churri, Hurri or Hurriter) were a people of the Bronze Age Near East.  They spoke a Hurro-Urartian language called Hurrian and lived in Anatolia and Northern Mesopotamia.  The largest and most influential Hurrian nation was the kingdom of Mitanni, the Mitanni perhaps being Indo-Iranian speakers who formed a ruling class over the Hurrians.  The population of the Indo-European-speaking Hittite Empire in Anatolia included a large population of Hurrians, and there is significant Hurrian influence in Hittite mythology.  By the Early Iron Age, the Hurrians had been assimilated with other peoples.

He won three Pulitzer Prizes—for the novel The Bridge of San Luis Rey, and for the plays Our Town and The Skin of Our Teeth —  and a U. S.  National Book Award for the novel The Eighth Day. Early yearsWilder was born in Madison, Wisconsin, the son of Amos Parker Wilder, a newspaper editor    and U. S.  diplomat, and Isabella Niven Wilder.  All of the Wilder children spent part of their childhood in China. 

Auxiliary verb<====>51685<====>Auxiliary verb An auxiliary verb (abbreviated  ) is a verb that adds functional or grammatical meaning to the clause in which it appears, such as to express tense, aspect, modality, voice, emphasis, etc.  Auxiliary verbs usually accompany a main verb.  The main verb provides the main semantic content of the clause.   An example is the verb have in the sentence I have finished my dinner.  Here, the main verb is finish, and the auxiliary have helps to express the perfect aspect.  Some sentences contain a chain of two or more auxiliary verbs.  Auxiliary verbs are also called helping verbs, helper verbs, or (verbal) auxiliaries. 

Richard Lloyd (guitarist)<====>51688<====>Richard Lloyd (guitarist)   Richard Lloyd (born October 25, 1951) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter, best known as a founding member of the rock band Television. Early lifeLloyd first became interested in music as a small child.  He saw The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show and experienced the phenomenon of Beatlemania, later going on to follow the British Invasion back to its roots in Blues and Jazz. Lloyd attended Stuyvesant High School in New York City, New York.   In his early teens he studied drums with William Kessler, who was the ghostwriter for Cozy Cole, one of the famous big-band drummers. 

Stanley Unwin (comedian)<====>51691<====>Stanley Unwin (comedian)  Stanley Unwin (7 June 1911 – 12 January 2002),  sometimes billed as "Professor" Stanley Unwin, was an English comedian, actor and comic writer. He invented his own comic language, "Unwinese",    referred to in the film Carry On Regardless (1961) as "gobbledygook".  Unwinese was a corrupted form of English in which many of the words were altered in playful and humorous ways, as in its description of Elvis Presley and his contemporaries as being "wasp-waist and swivel-hippy".  Unwin claimed that the inspiration came from his mother, who once told him that on the way home she had "falolloped (fallen) over" and "grazed her kneeclabbers". 

Pete and Dud<====>51692<====>Pete and DudPete and Dud were characters played by the comedians and entertainers Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.  The dialogue format originated in 1964 when Dudley Moore invited Peter Cook to appear in a television performance.  Cook scripted a conversation between two men from Dagenham wearing flat caps.  This proved to be very popular with television audiences and the partnership was continued during the series Not Only. . .  But Also.    Pete is a know-it-all and would-be intellectual, very much in the spirit of E.  L.  Wisty, and Dud is a put-upon Herbert in a subservient role, who tries to impress Pete with his knowledge. 

Kent M. Keith<====>51694<====>Kent M.  KeithKent M.  Keith (born in Brooklyn), is an American writer and leader in higher education.  Raised in Nebraska, California, Virginia, Rhode Island and Hawaii, where he graduated from secondary school, Keith entered Harvard College to study government.  After graduating, he read philosophy and politics at the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar,  received his law degree at Richardson School of Law at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and earned an Ed.  D.  from the Rossier School of Education at the University of Southern California. His early career was as an attorney with Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright and then as Director of the State of Hawaii Department of Planning and Economic Development. 

Franz Joseph I of Austria<====>51695<====>Franz Joseph I of Austria   Franz Joseph I or Francis Joseph I (18 August 1830 – 21 November 1916) was Emperor of Austria, King of Hungary, and monarch of other states in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, from 2 December 1848 to his death.   From 1 May 1850 to 24 August 1866 he was also President of the German Confederation.  He was the longest-reigning Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, as well as the third-longest-reigning monarch of any country in European history, after Louis XIV of France and Johann II of Liechtenstein.  In December 1848, Emperor Ferdinand abdicated the throne at Olomouc, as part of Minister-president Felix zu Schwarzenberg's plan to end the Revolutions of 1848 in Hungary. 

Fabien Barthez<====>51696<====>Fabien Barthez   Fabien Alain Barthez    ( ; born 28 June 1971)  is a French former footballer and racing driver who played as a goalkeeper with Toulouse, Marseille, AS Monaco, Manchester United, Nantes and the France national team, with whom he won the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000, and reached the final of the 2006 World Cup.  Nicknamed Le Divin Chauve ("The Divine Bald One"), due to his trademark shaved head,    Barthez is France's most capped player in the FIFA World Cup, with 17 appearances at the finals and shares the record for the most World Cup finals clean sheets with Peter Shilton, with ten. 

Deposition (law)<====>51697<====>Deposition (law) In the law of the United States, a deposition involves the taking of sworn, out-of-court oral testimony of a witness that may be reduced to a written transcript for later use in court or for discovery purposes. Depositions are commonly used in litigation in the United States and Canada, where they are called examinations for discovery.  They are almost always conducted outside court by the lawyers themselves, with no judge present to supervise the examination. Depositions developed in Canada and the United States in the nineteenth century.  Depositions are a part of the discovery process in which litigants gather information in preparation for trial. 

Extended real number line<====>51698<====>Extended real number line  In mathematics, the affinely extended real number system is obtained from the real number system   by adding two elements:   and   (read as positive infinity and negative infinity respectively).  These new elements are not real numbers.  It is useful in describing various limiting behaviors in calculus and mathematical analysis, especially in the theory of measure and integration.  The affinely extended real number system is denoted  \overline{\mathbb{R}}   or   or  . When the meaning is clear from context, the symbol   is often written simply as  . 

Superscalar processor<====>51702<====>Superscalar processor A superscalar processor is a CPU that implements a form of parallelism called instruction-level parallelism within a single processor.  In contrast to a scalar processor that can execute at most one single instruction per clock cycle, a superscalar processor can execute more than one instruction during a clock cycle by simultaneously dispatching multiple instructions to different execution units on the processor.  It therefore allows for more throughput (the number of instructions that can be executed in a unit of time) than would otherwise be possible at a given clock rate.  Each execution unit is not a separate processor (or a core if the processor is a multi-core processor), but an execution resource within a single CPU such as an arithmetic logic unit. 

Very long instruction word<====>51706<====>Very long instruction wordVery long instruction word (VLIW) refers to instruction set architectures designed to exploit instruction level parallelism (ILP).  Whereas conventional central processing units (CPU, processor) mostly allow programs to specify instructions to execute in sequence only, a VLIW processor allows programs to explicitly specify instructions to execute at the same time, concurrently, in parallel.  This design is intended to allow higher performance without the complexity inherent in some other designs. Overview The traditional means to improve performance in processors include dividing instructions into substeps so the instructions can be executed partly at the same time (termed pipelining), dispatching individual instructions to be executed independently, in different parts of the processor (superscalar architectures), and even executing instructions in an order different from the program (out-of-order execution). 

Bauhin<====>51711<====>BauhinBauhin — a family of physicians and scientists. Jean Bauhin (1511–1582): a French physician, who moved with his family to Basel after conversion to Protestantism.Two of his three sons:Gaspard Bauhin, or Caspar Bauhin (1560–1624): Swiss-French botanist.Johann Bauhin, or Jean Bauhin (1541–1613): Swiss-French botanist.Carl Linnaeus named the genus of plants Bauhinia after the two brothers. 

Russulales<====>51712<====>Russulales The Russulales are an order of the Agaricomycetes, (which include the agaric genera Russula and Lactarius and their polyporoid and corticioid relatives).  According to the Dictionary of the Fungi (10th edition, 2008), the order consists of 12 families, 80 genera, and 1767 species.According to Species Fungorum (January 2016), the order contains 13 families, 117 genera (16 not assigned to a family), and 3,060 species.  Russuloid agarics represent an independent evolutionary line of agarics, not directly related to the Agaricales. This group also includes a number of russuloid hypogeous fungi, polypores such as Bondarzewia, some tooth fungi (e. 

Taylor's theorem<====>51714<====>Taylor's theorem In calculus, Taylor's theorem gives an approximation of a k-times differentiable function around a given point by a k-th order Taylor polynomial.  For analytic functions the Taylor polynomials at a given point are finite order truncations of its Taylor series, which completely determines the function in some neighborhood of the point.  The exact content of "Taylor's theorem" is not universally agreed upon.  Indeed, there are several versions of it applicable in different situations, and some of them contain explicit estimates on the approximation error of the function by its Taylor polynomial. Taylor's theorem is named after the mathematician Brook Taylor, who stated a version of it in 1712. 

United States Atomic Energy Commission<====>51718<====>United States Atomic Energy Commission The United States Atomic Energy Commission, commonly known as the AEC, was an agency of the United States government established after World War II by U. S.  Congress to foster and control the peacetime development of atomic science and technology.  President Harry S.  Truman signed the McMahon/Atomic Energy Act on August 1, 1946, transferring the control of atomic energy from military to civilian hands, effective on January 1, 1947.   This shift gave the members of the AEC complete control of the plants, laboratories, equipment, and personnel assembled during the war to produce the atomic bomb. 

Robert Moon (postal inspector)<====>51722<====>Robert Moon (postal inspector)Robert Aurand Moon (April 15, 1917, Williamsport, Pennsylvania, USA – April 11, 2001, Leesburg, Florida, USA), sometimes called "Mr. ZIP", is considered the father of the ZIP Code or Zone Improvement Plan, a mechanism to route mail in the United States.  He developed the idea in 1944 while working as a postal inspector in Philadelphia, although his system used only the first three digits of what would eventually become a five-digit and later a nine-digit system. The first Directory of Post Offices using five-digit ZIP code numbers was published in 1963.References DEFAULTSORT 

Microsoft Bob<====>51723<====>Microsoft Bob Microsoft Bob was a Microsoft software product that was released on March 11 1995 and discontinued in early 1996.  The program was intended to provide a more user-friendly interface for the Windows 3. 1x, Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems, supplanting the Windows Program Manager.  Microsoft Bob presented screens showing a "house", with "rooms" that the user could go to containing familiar objects corresponding to computer applications—for instance, a desk with pen and paper, a checkbook, and other items.  In this case, clicking on the pen and paper would open the word processor. A cartoon dog named Rover and other cartoon characters provided guidance using speech balloons. 

Melinda Gates<====>51725<====>Melinda Gates  Melinda Ann Gates (née French; born August 15, 1964), DBE  is an American philanthropist, former Microsoft employee,    and co-founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.  She worked at Microsoft, where she was project manager for Microsoft Bob, Encarta and Expedia. Early life and educationMelinda Ann French was born on August 15, 1964 in Dallas, Texas.   She is the second of four children to Raymond Joseph French Jr. , an aerospace engineer, and Elaine Agnes Amerland, a homemaker.  French has an older sister and two younger brothers.  French, a Roman Catholic,  attended St. 

Moped<====>51727<====>Moped A moped (/ˈmoʊpɛd/ MOH-ped) is a small motorcycle, generally having a less stringent licensing requirement than motorcycles or automobiles because mopeds typically travel about the same speed as bicycles on public roads.  Mopeds by definition are driven by both an engine and bicycle pedals, but in common usage and in many jurisdictions the term moped is used for similar vehicles including a scooter. Some mopeds are of a step-through type design, while others are step-over designs, having a motorcycle-like frame, including a backbone and a raised fuel tank, mounted directly between the saddle and the head tube.  Some resemble motorized bicycles. 

Lipschitz continuity<====>51731<====>Lipschitz continuityIn mathematical analysis, Lipschitz continuity, named after Rudolf Lipschitz, is a strong form of uniform continuity for functions.  Intuitively, a Lipschitz continuous function is limited in how fast it can change: there exists a definite real number such that, for every pair of points on the graph of this function, the absolute value of the slope of the line connecting them is not greater than this real number; this bound is called a Lipschitz constant of the function (or modulus of uniform continuity).  For instance, every function that has bounded first derivatives is Lipschitz.  In the theory of differential equations, Lipschitz continuity is the central condition of the Picard–Lindelöf theorem which guarantees the existence and uniqueness of the solution to an initial value problem. 

Conveyor belt<====>51734<====>Conveyor belt A conveyor belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system (often shortened to belt conveyor).  A belt conveyor system is one of many types of conveyor systems.  A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums), with an endless loop of carrying medium—the conveyor belt—that rotates about them.  One or both of the pulleys are powered, moving the belt and the material on the belt forward.  The powered pulley is called the drive pulley while the unpowered pulley is called the idler pulley.  There are two main industrial classes of belt conveyors; Those in general material handling such as those moving boxes along inside a factory and bulk material handling such as those used to transport large volumes of resources and agricultural materials, such as grain, salt, coal, ore, sand, overburden and more. 

Dark moon<====>51735<====>Dark moon  A dark moon describes the Moon during the period it is invisible against the backdrop of the Sun in the sky.  The duration of a dark moon varies between 1. 5 and 3. 5 days, depending on its ecliptic latitude.  In astronomical usage, the new moon occurs in the middle of this period,  when the Moon and Sun are in conjunction.  This definition has entered popular usage, so that calendars will typically indicate the date of the "new moon" rather than the "dark moon".  However, "new moon" originally referred to the crescent phase on the first night it is visible, one or two days after conjunction. 

Blimp<====>51736<====>Blimp A blimp, or non-rigid airship, is an airship (dirigible) or barrage balloon  without an internal structural framework or a keel.  Unlike semi-rigid and rigid airships (e. g.  Zeppelins), blimps rely on the  pressure of the lifting gas (usually helium, rather than hydrogen) inside the envelope and the strength of the envelope itself to maintain their shape. PrincipleSince blimps keep their shape with internal overpressure, typically the only solid parts are the passenger car (gondola) and the tail fins.  A non-rigid airship that uses heated air instead of a light gas (such as helium) as a lifting medium is called a hot-air airship (sometimes there are battens near the bow, which assist with higher forces there from a mooring attachment or from the greater aerodynamic pressures there). 

Drawing board<====>51742<====>Drawing board  A drawing board (also drawing table, drafting table or architect's table) is, in its antique form, a kind of multipurpose desk which can be used for any kind of drawing, writing or impromptu sketching on a large sheet of paper or for reading a large format book or other oversized document or for drafting precise technical illustrations (such as engineering drawings or architectural drawings).  The drawing table used to be a frequent companion to a pedestal desk in a gentleman's study or private library, during the pre-industrial and early industrial era. During the Industrial Revolution draftsmanship gradually became a specialized trade and drawing tables slowly moved out of the libraries and offices of most gentlemen. 

American Pie (song)<====>51744<====>American Pie (song)  "American Pie" is a song by American singer and songwriter Don McLean.  Recorded and released on the American Pie album in 1971, the single was a number-one US hit for four weeks in 1972 and also topped the charts in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.  In the UK, the single reached No.  2 on its original 1972 release while a reissue in 1991 reached No.  12.   The song was listed as the No.  5 song on the RIAA project Songs of the Century.  A truncated version of the song was covered by Madonna in 2000 and reached No. 

Baen Books<====>51745<====>Baen Books  Baen Books is an American publishing house for science fiction and fantasy.  In science fiction, it emphasizes space opera, hard science fiction, and military science fiction.  The company was established in 1983 by science fiction publisher and editor Jim Baen.  After his death in 2006, he was succeeded as publisher by long-time executive editor Toni Weisskopf. HistoryBaen Books was founded in 1983 out of a negotiated agreement between Jim Baen and Simon & Schuster.  Simon & Schuster was undergoing massive reorganization and wanted to hire Baen to head and revitalize the science fiction line of its Pocket Books division.

Marco van Basten<====>51749<====>Marco van Basten   Marcel "Marco" van Basten ( ; born 31 October 1964) is a Dutch football manager and former football player, who played for Ajax and Milan, as well as the Netherlands national team, in the 1980s and early '90s as a forward.  He is regarded as one of the greatest European forwards and one of the greatest footballers of all time.  He has scored 300 goals in a high-profile career, but played his last match in 1993 at age 28 due to an injury which forced his retirement two years later.   He was later the head coach of Ajax and the Netherlands national team. 

Plantago<====>51755<====>Plantago  Plantago is a genus of about 200 species of small, inconspicuous plants commonly called plantains or fleaworts.  The common name plantain is shared with the unrelated cooking plantain, a kind of banana.  Most are herbaceous plants, though a few are subshrubs growing to   tall.  DescriptionThe leaves are sessile, but have a narrow part near the stem which is a pseudo-petiole.  They have three or five parallel veins that diverge in the wider part of the leaf.  Leaves are broad or narrow, depending on the species.  The inflorescences are borne on stalks typically   tall, and can be a short cone or a long spike, with numerous tiny wind-pollinated flowers. 

Tercet<====>51758<====>TercetA tercet is composed of three lines of poetry, forming a stanza or a complete poem.  Examples of Tercet formsEnglish-language haiku is an example of an unrhymed tercet poem.  A poetic triplet is a tercet in which all three lines follow the same rhyme, a a a; triplets are rather rare; they are more customarily used sparingly in verse of heroic couplets or other couplet verse, to add extraordinary emphasis.  Other types of tercet include an enclosed tercet where the lines rhyme in an a b a pattern and terza rima where the a b a pattern of a verse is continued in the next verse by making the outer lines of the next stanza rhyme with the central line of the preceding stanza, b c b, as in the terza rima or terzina form of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. 

Graves' disease<====>51760<====>Graves' disease  Graves' disease, also known as toxic diffuse goiter, is an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid.   It frequently results in and is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism.   It also often results in an enlarged thyroid.   Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism may include irritability, muscle weakness, sleeping problems, a fast heartbeat, poor tolerance of heat, diarrhea, and unintentional weight loss.   Other symptoms may include thickening of the skin on the shins, known as pretibial myxedema, and eye bulging, a condition caused by Graves' ophthalmopathy.   About 25 to 80% of people with the condition develop eye problems. 

Elias gamma coding<====>51761<====>Elias gamma coding Elias gamma code is a universal code encoding positive integers developed by Peter Elias. It is used most commonly when coding integers whose upper-bound cannot be determined beforehand. EncodingTo code a number x≥1:Let N=⌊log 2  x⌋ be the highest power of 2 it contains, so 2 N  ≤ x  N+1 . Write out N zero bits, thenAppend the binary form of x, an N+1-bit binary number. An equivalent way to express the same process:Encode N in unary; that is, as N zeroes followed by a one. Append the remaining N binary digits of x to this representation of N. 

Somerset<====>51763<====>SomersetSomerset ( ) (or archaically, Somersetshire) is a county in South West England which borders Gloucestershire and Bristol to the north, Wiltshire to the east, Dorset to the south-east and Devon to the south-west.  It is bounded to the north and west by the Severn Estuary and the Bristol Channel, its coastline facing southeastern Wales.  Its traditional border with Gloucestershire is the River Avon.   Somerset's county town is Taunton. Somerset is a rural county of rolling hills such as the Blackdown Hills, Mendip Hills, Quantock Hills and Exmoor National Park, and large flat expanses of land including the Somerset Levels. 

Rock Around the Clock<====>51764<====>Rock Around the Clock   "Rock Around the Clock" is a rock and roll song in the 12-bar blues format written by Max C.  Freedman and James E.  Myers (the latter under the pseudonym "Jimmy De Knight") in 1952.  The best-known and most successful rendition was recorded by Bill Haley & His Comets in 1954 for American Decca.  It was a number one single on both the United States and United Kingdom charts and also re-entered the UK Singles Chart in the 1960s and 1970s. It was not the first rock and roll record, nor was it the first successful record of the genre (Bill Haley had American chart success with "Crazy Man, Crazy" in 1953, and in 1954, "Shake, Rattle and Roll" sung by Big Joe Turner reached No. 

Duomo<====>51765<====>Duomo  Duomo ( ,  ) is an Italian term for a church with the features of, or having been built to serve as, a cathedral, whether or not it currently plays this rôle.   Monza Cathedral, for example, has never been a diocesan seat and is by definition not a cathedral.   On the other hand, the city of Trevi no longer has a bishop, although it once did, and the erstwhile cathedral of Emilianus of Trevi is now a mere church.  By contradistinction, the Italian word for a cathedral in sensu stricto is cattedrale.

Let L=⌊log 2  N+1⌋ be the highest power of 2 in N+1, so 2 L  ≤ N+1  L+1 . Write L zeros, followed bythe L+1-bit binary representation of N+1, followed byall but the leading bit (i. e.  the last N bits) of X. An equivalent way to express the same process:Separate X into the highest power of 2 it contains (2 N ) and the remaining N binary digits. 

Sidney Altman<====>51775<====>Sidney Altman  Sidney Altman (born May 7, 1939) is a Canadian and American    molecular biologist, who is the Sterling Professor of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology and Chemistry at Yale University.  In 1989 he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Thomas R.  Cech for their work on the catalytic properties of RNA. Family and educationAltman was born on May 7, 1939, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  His parents, Ray (Arlin), a textile worker, and Victor Altman, a grocer,  were immigrants to Canada, each coming from Eastern Europe as a young adult, in the 1920s. 

Hydrostatic equilibrium<====>51776<====>Hydrostatic equilibrium In fluid mechanics, a fluid is said to be in hydrostatic equilibrium or hydrostatic balance when it is at rest, or when the flow velocity at each point is constant over time.  This occurs when external forces such as gravity are balanced by a pressure gradient force.   For instance, the pressure-gradient force prevents gravity from collapsing Earth's atmosphere into a thin, dense shell, whereas gravity prevents the pressure gradient force from diffusing the atmosphere into space. Hydrostatic equilibrium is the current distinguishing criterion between dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies, and has other roles in astrophysics and planetary geology. 

Fleet Air Arm<====>51777<====>Fleet Air Arm    The Fleet Air Arm (FAA) is the branch of the British Royal Navy responsible for the operation of naval aircraft.  The Fleet Air Arm currently operates the AgustaWestland Merlin, Westland Sea King, and AgustaWestland Wildcat helicopters and the BAE Hawk.  Helicopters such as the Lynx and Westland Wasp have been deployed on smaller vessels since 1964, taking over the roles once performed by biplanes such as the Fairey Swordfish. The Fleet Air Arm was formed in 1924 as an organisational unit of the Royal Air Force which was then operating the aircraft embarked on RN ships – the Royal Naval Air Service having been merged with the British Army's Royal Flying Corps in 1918, to form the Royal Air Force – and did not come under the direct control of the Admiralty until mid-1939. 

Church of Satan<====>51778<====>Church of Satan   The Church of Satan is a religious organization dedicated to Satanism as codified in The Satanic Bible.

In 2001, Peter H.  Gilmore was appointed to the position of high priest, and the church's headquarters were moved to Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, New York City.  The church does not believe in the Devil, nor a Christian or Islamic notion of Satan. 

Map projection<====>51784<====>Map projectionA map projection is a systematic transformation of the latitudes and longitudes of locations from the surface of a sphere or an ellipsoid into locations on a plane.Maps cannot be created without map projections.  All map projections necessarily distort the surface in some fashion.  Depending on the purpose of the map, some distortions are acceptable and others are not; therefore, different map projections exist in order to preserve some properties of the sphere-like body at the expense of other properties.  There is no limit to the number of possible map projections. 

The Flintstones<====>51787<====>The Flintstones    The Flintstones is an American animated sitcom produced by Hanna-Barbera for ABC.  The series takes place in a romanticized Stone Age setting, depicts the lives of the titular characters and their next-door neighbors and best friends.  It was originally broadcast from September 30, 1960, to April 1, 1966, in a prime time schedule, the first such instance for an animated series. The continuing popularity of The Flintstones rested heavily on its juxtaposition of modern everyday concerns in the Stone Age setting.    The Flintstones was the most financially successful network animated franchise for three decades, until The Simpsons debuted decades later. 

Bubblegum pop<====>51788<====>Bubblegum pop  Bubblegum pop (also known as bubblegum music or simply bubblegum) is a genre of pop music with an upbeat sound contrived and marketed to appeal to pre-teens and teenagers, which may be produced in an assembly-line process, driven by producers and often using unknown singers.  Bubblegum's classic period ran from 1967 to 1972.A second wave of bubblegum began two years later and ran until 1977 when disco took over and punk rock emerged. The genre was predominantly a singles phenomenon rather than an album-oriented one.  Acts were typically manufactured in the studio using session musicians, and most bubblegum pop groups were one-hit wonders. 

E.164<====>51791<====>E. 164E. 164 is an ITU-T recommendation, titled The international public telecommunication numbering plan, that defines a numbering plan for the worldwide public switched telephone network (PSTN) and some other data networks. E. 164 defines a general format for international telephone numbers.  Plan-conforming numbers are limited to a maximum of 15 digits, excluding the international call prefix.   The presentation of a number is usually prefixed with the plus sign (+), indicating that the number includes the country calling code.  When dialing, the number must typically be prefixed with the appropriate international call prefix (in place of the plus sign), which is a trunk code to reach an international circuit from within the country of call origination.

Side-scan sonar<====>51794<====>Side-scan sonar Side-scan sonar (also sometimes called side scan sonar, sidescan sonar, side  imaging sonar, side-imaging sonar and bottom classification sonar) is a category of sonar system that is used to efficiently create an image of large areas of the sea floor. UsesSide-scan sonar may be used to conduct surveys for marine archaeology; in conjunction with seafloor samples it is able to provide an understanding of the differences in material and texture type of the seabed.  Side-scan sonar imagery is also a commonly used tool to detect debris items and other obstructions on the seafloor that may be hazardous to shipping or to seafloor installations by the oil and gas industry. 

Underwater archaeology<====>51795<====>Underwater archaeologyUnderwater archaeology is archaeology practiced underwater.   As with all other branches of archaeology, it evolved from its roots in pre-history and in the classical era to include sites from the historical and industrial eras.  Its acceptance has been a relatively late development due to the difficulties of accessing and working underwater sites, and because the application of archaeology to underwater sites initially emerged from the skills and tools developed by shipwreck salvagers.   As a result, underwater archaeology initially struggled to establish itself as bona fide archaeological research.   The situation changed when universities began teaching the subject and when a theoretical and practical base for the sub-discipline was firmly established. 

List of people on postage stamps<====>51798<====>List of people on postage stampsSince 1840, when the Penny Black featured a profile of Queen Victoria, it has been a tradition worldwide for nations to honor individuals on their postage stamps.  Typical choices include monarchs, important figures of history, politicians, cultural leaders, and (more recently) celebrities. The usual practice is for the stamp to feature a portrait of the person, either full-length or head alone.  In a few cases, the person being honored is represented by an image relating to the person's life.  However, the depiction of a work of art (such as for a Christmas stamp) is not considered to be honoring the artist.

He represented the ministry with Georg Leibbrandt in the Wannsee Conference. 

Anthony Fokker<====>51808<====>Anthony Fokker   Anton Herman Gerard "Anthony" Fokker (6 April 1890 – 23 December 1939) was a Dutch aviation pioneer and aircraft manufacturer.  He is most famous for the fighter aircraft he produced in Germany during the First World War such as the Eindecker monoplanes,  the Dr. 1 triplane and the D. VII biplane. After the treaty of Versailles forbade Germany to produce airplanes, Fokker moved his business to the Netherlands.  There his company was responsible for a variety of successful aircraft including the Fokker trimotor, a successful passenger aircraft of the inter-war years.  He died in North America in 1939. 

Fokker Dr.I<====>51809<====>Fokker Dr. I The Fokker Dr. I (Dreidecker, "triplane" in German) was a World War I fighter aircraft built by Fokker-Flugzeugwerke.

Amphora<====>51812<====>Amphora   An amphora (Greek: Αμφορέας, English plural: amphorae or amphoras) is a type of container of a characteristic shape and size, descending from at least as early as the Neolithic Period.  Amphorae were used in vast numbers for the transport and storage of various products, both liquid and dry, but mostly for wine.  They are most often ceramic, but examples in metals and other materials have been found.   Versions of the amphorae were one of many shapes used in Ancient Greek vase painting.  The amphora complements the large storage container, the pithos, which makes available capacities between one-half and two and one-half tons. 

Sumo<====>51814<====>Sumo or sumo wrestling is a competitive full-contact wrestling sport where a rikishi (wrestler) attempts to force another wrestler out of a circular ring (dohyō) or into touching the ground with anything other than the soles of his feet.  The characters 相撲 literally mean "striking one another". The sport originated in Japan, the only country where it is practiced professionally.  It is generally considered a gendai budō (a modern Japanese martial art), but this definition is misleading, as the sport has a history spanning many centuries. Many ancient traditions have been preserved in sumo, and even today the sport includes many ritual elements, such as the use of salt purification, from Shinto.

Styled as an anthropomorphic black duck, the character has appeared in cartoon series such as Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, where he usually has been depicted as the best friend and occasional arch-rival of Bugs Bunny.  Daffy was one of the first of the new "screwball" characters that emerged in the late 1930s to replace traditional everyman characters who were more popular earlier in the decade,  such as Mickey Mouse and Popeye.  Daffy starred in 130 shorts in the golden age, making him the third-most frequent character in the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons, behind Bugs Bunny's 180 appearances and Porky Pig's 162 appearances. 

Porky Pig<====>51848<====>Porky Pig Porky Pig is an animated cartoon character in the Warner Bros.  Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons.  He was the first character created by the studio to draw audiences based on his star power, and the animators created many critically acclaimed shorts using the fat little pig.

Politburo of the Communist Party of China<====>51851<====>Politburo of the Communist Party of China   The Central Politburo of the Communist Party of China formally Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, formerly known as Central Bureau (中央局) before 1927, is a group of 25 people who oversee the Communist Party of China.  Unlike politburos (political bureaus) of other Communist parties, power within the politburo is centralized in the Politburo Standing Committee, a smaller group of Politburo members.  The Politburo is nominally elected by the Central Committee.  In practice, however, analysts believe that new members of the Politburo and its Standing Committee are chosen through a series of deliberations by current Politburo members and retired Politburo Standing Committee members. 

Sidewalk<====>51852<====>Sidewalk A sidewalk (American English) or pavement (British English), also known as a footpath or footway, is a path along the side of a road.  A sidewalk may accommodate moderate changes in grade (height) and is normally separated from the vehicular section by a curb.  There may also be a median strip or road verge (a strip of vegetation, grass or bushes or trees or a combination of these) either between the sidewalk and the roadway or between the sidewalk and the boundary. In some places, the same term may also be used for a paved path, trail or footpath that is not next to a road, for example, a path through a park. 

John Doe<====>51853<====>John Doe   "John Doe" , "John Roe" or "Richard Roe" (for men), "Jane Doe" or "Jane Roe" (for women), and "Baby Doe", "Janie Doe" or  "Johnny Doe" (for children), or just "Doe" or "Roe" are multiple-use names that have two distinct usages.  Firstly, and especially in the United States, Canada and Ireland, they may refer to an unidentified person, or a party in a legal action whose identity is being withheld officially.    In the context of law enforcement in the United States, such names are often used to refer to a corpse whose identity is unknown or unconfirmed.

Albertsons<====>51857<====>Albertsons Albertsons Companies LLC   is an American grocery company founded and headquartered in Boise, Idaho.  It is privately owned and operated by investors, including Cerberus Capital Management. With 2,200 stores and more than 250,000 employees,    the company is the second largest supermarket chain in North America after Kroger, which has 2,778 stores.  Prior to its January 2015 merger with Safeway Inc.  for $9. 2 billion,  it had 1,075 supermarkets located in 29 U. S.  states under 12 different banners.  Its predecessor company, Albertsons, Inc. 

Jewel (supermarket)<====>51858<====>Jewel (supermarket)  Jewel-Osco is a supermarket chain headquartered in Itasca, Illinois, a Chicago suburb.   Jewel-Osco has 187 stores across northern, central, and western Illinois; eastern Iowa; and portions of northwest Indiana.Jewel-Osco and Jewel are currently wholly owned subsidiaries of Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons.  The company original started as a door-to-door coffee delivery service before it expanded into delivering non-perishable groceries and later into grocery stores, and supermarkets.  Prior to its 1984 acquisition by American Stores, Jewel evolved into a large multi-state holding company that operated several supermarket chains and other non-food retail chain stores located from coast to coast and had operated under several different brand names. 

Osco Drug and Sav-on Drugs<====>51860<====>Osco Drug and Sav-on Drugs   Osco Drug and Sav-on Drugs were the names of a pair of chain pharmacies that operated in the United States.  Osco Drug was founded by the Skaggs family.  Alpha Beta grocery store was purchased by American Stores in 1961.  Skaggs Drug Centers bought American Stores in 1979 and assumed the American Stores name.  Sav-on Drugs was a California-based pharmacy chain that was acquired by Osco's parent company in 1980.  Both Osco and Sav-on stores eventually came under the ownership of American Stores, then Albertsons, and finally SuperValu before the stores were sold off. 

Supermarket<====>51862<====>Supermarket   A supermarket is a self-service shop offering a wide variety of food and household products, organized into aisles.  It is larger and has a wider selection than a traditional grocery store, but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a hypermarket or big-box market. The supermarket typically comprises meat, fresh produce, dairy, and baked goods aisles, along with shelf space reserved for canned and packaged goods as well as for various non-food items such as kitchenware, household cleaners, pharmacy products and pet supplies.  Some supermarkets also sell a variety of other household products that are consumed regularly, such as alcohol (where permitted), medicine, and clothes, and some stores sell a much wider range of non-food products: DVDs, sporting equipment, board games, and seasonal items (e. 

Rocket 88<====>51864<====>Rocket 88  "Rocket 88" (originally written as Rocket "88") is a rhythm and blues song that was first recorded in Memphis, Tennessee, on  March 3 or 5, 1951 (accounts differ).   The recording was credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, who were actually Ike Turner's Kings of Rhythm. The record reached number one on the Billboard R&B chart.   Many music writers acknowledge its importance in the development of rock and roll music, with several considering it to be the first rock and roll record. Original versionThe original version of the twelve-bar blues song was credited to Jackie Brenston (Ike Turner's saxophonist) and his Delta Cats, which hit number one on the R&B charts. 

Paper clip<====>51873<====>Paper clip A paper clip (or sometimes paperclip) is a device used to hold sheets of paper together, usually made of steel wire bent to a looped shape.  Most paper clips are variations of the Gem type introduced in the 1890s or earlier, characterized by the almost two full loops made by the wire.  Common to paper clips proper is their utilization of torsion and elasticity in the wire, and friction between wire and paper.  When a moderate number of sheets are inserted between the two "tongues" of the clip, the tongues will be forced apart and cause torsion in the bend of the wire to grip the sheets together. 

Googly<====>51874<====>Googly   In cricket, a googly (or wrong 'un ) is a type of deceptive delivery bowled by a right-arm leg spin bowler.  In Australia, it is occasionally referred to as a Bosie (or Bosey), an eponym in honour of its inventor Bernard Bosanquet.  A leg spin bowler bowls in a leg spin way but it goes in the off side direction. Explanation While a normal leg break spins from the leg to the off side, away from a right-handed batsman, a googly spins the other way, from off to leg, into a right-handed batsman (and is distinct from an off break delivery). 

Pim Fortuyn List<====>51876<====>Pim Fortuyn List  The Pim Fortuyn List ( , LPF) was a right-wing populist  political party in the Netherlands.  The eponymous founder of the party was Pim Fortuyn, a charismatic former university professor and political columnist who initially had planned to contest the 2002 general election as leader of the Livable Netherlands (LN) party.  He was however dismissed as party leader in February 2002 due to controversial remarks he made in a newspaper interview on immigration-related issues, and instead founded LPF a few days later.  After gaining support in opinion polls, Fortuyn was assassinated on 6 May 2002, nine days before the election. 

Bowling (cricket)<====>51878<====>Bowling (cricket)   Bowling, in cricket, is the action of propelling the ball toward the wicket defended by a batsman.  A player skilled at bowling is called a bowler; a bowler who is also a competent batsman is known as an all-rounder.  Bowling the ball is distinguished from throwing the ball by a strictly specified biomechanical definition, which restricts the angle of extension of the elbow.  A single act of bowling the ball towards the batsman is called a ball or a delivery.  Bowlers bowl deliveries in sets of six, called an over.  Once a bowler has bowled an over, a teammate will bowl an over from the other end of the pitch. 

Gamal Abdel Nasser<====>51879<====>Gamal Abdel Nasser    Gamal Abdel Nasser Hussein ( ,    ; 15 January 1918 – 28 September 1970) was the second President of Egypt, serving from 1956 until his death.  Nasser led the 1952 overthrow of the monarchy and introduced far-reaching land reforms the following year.  Following a 1954 attempt on his life by a Muslim Brotherhood member, he cracked down on the organization, put President Muhammad Naguib under house arrest, and assumed executive office, officially becoming president  in June 1956. Nasser's popularity in Egypt and the Arab world skyrocketed after his nationalization of the Suez Canal and his political victory in the subsequent Suez Crisis. 

Hosni Mubarak<====>51884<====>Hosni Mubarak    Muhammad Hosni El Sayed Mubarak ( ,  ,  ; born 4 May 1928) is a former Egyptian military and political leader who served as the fourth President of Egypt from 1981 to 2011. Before he entered politics, Mubarak was a career officer in the Egyptian Air Force.  He served as its commander from 1972 to 1975 and rose to the rank of air chief marshal in 1973.   Some time in the 1950s, he returned to the Air Force Academy as an instructor, remaining there until early 1959.   He assumed presidency after the assassination of Anwar Sadat. 

Multiculturalism<====>51885<====>MulticulturalismMulticulturalism is a term with a range of meanings in the contexts of sociology, political philosophy, and in colloquial use.  In sociology and everyday usage, it is a synonym for "ethnic pluralism" with the two terms often used interchangeably, for example a cultural pluralism in which various ethnic groups collaborate and enter into a dialogue with one another without having to sacrifice their particular identities.  It can describe a mixed ethnic community area where multiple cultural traditions exist, or a single country within which they do.  Groups associated with an aboriginal ethnic group and foreigner ethnic groups are often the focus. 

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade<====>51888<====>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade   Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a 1989 American action-adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg, from a story co-written by executive producer George Lucas.  It is the third installment in the Indiana Jones franchise.  Harrison Ford reprises the title role and Sean Connery plays Indiana's father, Henry Jones Sr.  Other cast members featured include Alison Doody, Denholm Elliott, Julian Glover, River Phoenix, and John Rhys-Davies.  In the film, set largely in 1938, Indiana searches for his father, a Holy Grail scholar, who has been kidnapped by Nazis. 

Textile<====>51892<====>Textile  A Textile  is a flexible material consisting of a network of natural or artificial fibres (yarn or thread).  Yarn is produced by spinning raw fibres of wool, flax, cotton, hemp, or other materials to produce long strands.   Textiles are formed by weaving, knitting, crocheting, knotting, or felting. The related words fabric  and cloth  are often used in textile assembly trades (such as tailoring and dressmaking) as synonyms for textile.  However, there are subtle differences in these terms in specialized usage.  A textile is any material made of interlacing fibres, including carpeting and geotextiles. 

Putrescine<====>51894<====>Putrescine Putrescine,  or tetramethylenediamine, is a foul-smelling  organic chemical compound NH 2 (CH 2 ) 4 NH 2  (1,4-diaminobutane or butanediamine) that is related to cadaverine; both are produced by the breakdown of amino acids in living and dead organisms and both are toxic in large doses.    The two compounds are largely responsible for the foul odor of putrefying flesh, but also contribute to the odor of such processes as bad breath and bacterial vaginosis.   They are also found in semen and some microalgae, together with related molecules like spermine and spermidine. 

Cadaverine<====>51896<====>Cadaverine Cadaverine is a foul-smelling diamine compound produced by the putrefaction of animal tissue.  Cadaverine is a toxic  diamine with the formula NH 2 (CH 2 ) 5 NH 2 , which is similar to putrescine.  Cadaverine is also known by the names 1,5-pentanediamine and pentamethylenediamine. HistoryPutrescine  and cadaverine  were first described in 1885 by the Berlin physician Ludwig Brieger (1849–1919).  ProductionCadaverine is the decarboxylation product of the amino acid lysine.  Wolfgang Legrum: Riechstoffe, zwischen Gestank und Duft, Vieweg + Teubner Verlag (2011) S.  65,  .  This can be done by heating lysine with a small amount of sodium bicarbonate mixed in. 

The Archers<====>51897<====>The Archers  The Archers is the world's longest-running radio soap opera.  The British production, which has aired over 18,500 episodes, is broadcast on Radio 4, the BBC's main spoken-word channel.  Originally billed as "an everyday story of country folk", it is now described as "contemporary drama in a rural setting".    Five pilot episodes were aired in 1950 and the first episode was broadcast nationally on 1 January 1951.  A significant show in British popular culture, and with over five million listeners, it is Radio 4's most listened-to non-news programme,    With over one million listeners via the internet, the programme holds the record for BBC Radio online listening figures. 

Douglas Smith (broadcaster)<====>51899<====>Douglas Smith (broadcaster)   Douglas Smith (11th February 1924 - 15 October 1972)began his broadcasting career with the BBC European Service (now the World Service) in 1946 and later worked as an announcer and newsreader on the Home Service and the Third Programme.   He is perhaps best known as the formal announcer on Beyond Our Ken (1958–1964), its more famous successor Round the Horne (1965–1968) and the short-lived Stop Messing About (1969–1970), where his 'BBC accent' was used to comic effect.   Listeners remember him for advertising Dobbiroids (a fictional product for horses) and the huge number of naïve sound effects he made to assist in the development of humorous and often bizarre plots. 

Betty Marsden<====>51900<====>Betty Marsden   Betty Marsden (24 February 1919 – 18 July 1998) was an English comedy actress.  She is particularly remembered as a cast member of the radio series Beyond Our Ken and Round the Horne. Early lifeMarsden was born in West Derby, Liverpool,  and grew up in near poverty in Somerset.  Her music teacher recognised her talent at the age of six, and became her guardian.She attended the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts and during World War II she entertained the troops as a member of ENSA.   It was at this time that she met and married her husband, Dr Jimmy Wilson Muggoch, an army doctor from Edinburgh. 

Tyrosine kinase<====>51903<====>Tyrosine kinase A tyrosine kinase is an enzyme that can transfer a phosphate group from ATP to a protein in a cell.  It functions as an "on" or "off" switch in many cellular functions.  Tyrosine kinases are a subclass of protein kinase. The phosphate group is attached to the amino acid tyrosine on the protein.  Tyrosine kinases are a subgroup of the larger class of protein kinases that attach phosphate groups to other amino acids (serine and threonine).  Phosphorylation of proteins by kinases is an important mechanism in communicating signals within a cell (signal transduction) and regulating cellular activity, such as cell division. 

Henry Mancini<====>51905<====>Henry Mancini   Enrico Nicola "Henry" Mancini (April 16, 1924 – June 14, 1994)  was an American composer, conductor and arranger, who is best remembered for his film and television scores.  Often cited as one of the greatest composers in the history of film,  he won four Academy Awards, a Golden Globe, and twenty Grammy Awards, plus a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. His best known works include the theme to The Pink Panther film series ("The Pink Panther Theme"), "Moon River" to Breakfast at Tiffany's, and the theme to the Peter Gunn television series. 

Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)<====>51906<====>Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)  Breakfast at Tiffany's is a 1961 American romantic comedy film directed by Blake Edwards and written by George Axelrod, loosely based on Truman Capote's novella of the same name.  Starring Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard, and featuring Patricia Neal, Buddy Ebsen, Martin Balsam, and Mickey Rooney, the film was initially released on October 5, 1961 by Paramount Pictures. Hepburn's portrayal of Holly Golightly as the naïve, eccentric socialite is generally considered to be the actress's most memorable and identifiable role.  Hepburn regarded it as one of her most challenging roles, since she was an introvert required to play an extrovert. 

Luke Helder<====>51908<====>Luke Helder Lucas John "Luke" Helder (born May 5, 1981) is a former University of Wisconsin–Stout student from Pine Island, Minnesota, who earned notoriety as the Midwest Pipe Bomber in May 2002. BombingsWhile attending the University of Wisconsin–Stout and living in an apartment in Menomonie, Wisconsin, Helder planned to plant pipe bombs in mailboxes across the United States to create a smiley face shape on the United States map.  The bombs, which were packed with BBs and nails, were rigged to explode as the mailboxes were opened.  Completed and rigged bombs were found in Nebraska, Colorado, Texas, Illinois and Iowa. 

Quantum key distribution<====>51910<====>Quantum key distribution Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a secure communication method which implements a cryptographic protocol involving components of quantum mechanics.  It enables two parties to produce a shared random secret key known only to them, which can then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages.  It is often incorrectly called quantum cryptography, as it is the best-known example of a quantum cryptographic task. An important and unique property of quantum key distribution is the ability of the two communicating users to detect the presence of any third party trying to gain knowledge of the key.  This results from a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics: the process of measuring a quantum system in general disturbs the system. 

Legislation<====>51913<====>Legislation Legislation (or "statutory law") is law which has been promulgated (or "enacted") by a legislature or other governing body or the process of making it.   Before an item of legislation becomes law it may be known as a bill, and may be broadly referred to as "legislation", while it remains under consideration to distinguish it from other business.  Legislation can have many purposes: to regulate, to authorize, to outlaw, to provide (funds), to sanction, to grant, to declare or to restrict.  It may be contrasted with a non-legislative act which is adopted by an executive or administrative body under the authority of a legislative act or for implementing a legislative act. 

I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again<====>51914<====>I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again   I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again (often abbreviated as ISIRTA) is a BBC radio comedy programme that originated from the Cambridge University Footlights revue Cambridge Circus.  It had a devoted youth following, with live recordings being more akin to a rock concert than a comedy show, a tradition that continued to I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue. The pilot programme and Series 1 were broadcast on the BBC Home Service.   Series 2–9 were broadcast on the BBC Light Programme (renamed BBC Radio 2 in September 1967). It was first broadcast on 3 April 1964, the pilot programme having been broadcast on 30 December 1963 under the title "Cambridge Circus". 

Transcontinental railroad<====>51916<====>Transcontinental railroadA transcontinental railroad is a contiguous network of railroad trackage  that crosses a continental land mass with terminals at different oceans or continental borders.  Such networks can be via the tracks of either a single railroad, or over those owned or controlled by multiple railway companies along a continuous route.  Although Europe is crisscrossed by railways, the railroads within Europe are usually not considered transcontinental, with the possible exception of the historic Orient Express. Transcontinental railroads helped open up unpopulated interior regions of continents to exploration and settlement that would not otherwise have been feasible.  In many cases they also formed the backbones of cross-country passenger and freight transportation networks. 

Bill Haley & His Comets<====>51917<====>Bill Haley & His Comets   Bill Haley & His Comets were an American rock and roll band, founded in 1952 and continued until Haley's death in 1981.  The band, also known as Bill Haley and the Comets and Bill Haley's Comets (and variations thereof) From late 1954 to late 1956, the group placed nine singles in the Top 20, one of those a number one and three more in the Top Ten.  Bandleader Bill Haley had previously been a country music performer; after recording a country and western-styled version of "Rocket 88", a rhythm and blues song, he changed musical direction to a new sound which came to be called rock and roll. 

René Dumont<====>51920<====>René Dumont René Dumont (March 13, 1904 – June 18, 2001) was a French engineer in agronomy, a sociologist, and an environmental politician. BiographyDumont was born in Cambrai, Nord, in the north of France.  His father was a professor in agriculture and his grandfather was a farmer.  He graduated from the INA P-G, as an engineer in agronomy.  First sent to Vietnam (1929) at the end of his studies, he was disgusted by colonialism and returned to Paris to spend most of his career as a professor of agricultural sciences (1933–74). René Dumont started his career as a promoter of the use of chemical fertizers and mechanisation. 

Ring road<====>51922<====>Ring road   A ring road (also known as beltline, beltway, circumferential (high)way, loop or orbital) is a road or a series of connected roads encircling a town, city, or country. NomenclatureThe name "ring road" is used for the majority of metropolitan circumferential routes in the European Union, such as the Berliner Ring, the Brussels Ring, the Amsterdam Ring, the Boulevard Périphérique around Paris and the Leeds Inner and Outer ring roads.  Australia, Pakistan and India also use the term ring road, as in Melbourne's Western Ring Road, Lahore's Lahore Ring Road and Hyderabad's Outer Ring Road.  In Canada the term is the most commonly used, with "orbital" also used, but to a much lesser extent. 

Timeline of United States diplomatic history<====>51924<====>Timeline of United States diplomatic history  The diplomatic history of the United States oscillated among three positions: isolation from diplomatic entanglements of other (typically European) nations (but with economic connections to the world); alliances with European and other military partners; and unilateralism, or operating on its own sovereign policy decisions.  The US always was large in terms of area, but its population was small, only 4 million in 1790.   Population growth was rapid, reaching 7. 2 million in 1810, 32 million in 1860, 76 million in 1900, 132 million in 1940, and 316 million in 2013. 

Secotioid<====>51926<====>SecotioidSecotioid fungi are an intermediate growth form between mushroom-like hymenomycetes and closed bag-shaped gasteromycetes, where an evolutionary process of gasteromycetation has started but not run to completion.   Secotioid fungi may or may not have opening caps, but in any case they often lack the vertical geotropic orientation of the hymenophore needed to allow the spores to be dispersed by wind, and the basidiospores are not forcibly discharged or otherwise prevented from being dispersed (e. g.  gills completely inclosed and never exposed as in the secotioid form of Lentinus tigrinus)—note—some mycologists do not consider a species to be secotioid unless it has lost ballistospory. 

Amtrak<====>51928<====>Amtrak   The National Railroad Passenger Corporation, doing business as Amtrak  ,  is a passenger railroad service that provides medium- and long-distance intercity service in the contiguous United States.  Founded in 1971 to take over most of the remaining U. S.  passenger rail services, it is partially government funded yet operated and managed as a for-profit corporation.   Amtrak's headquarters is located in Union Station in Washington, D. C.  Amtrak serves more than 500 destinations in 46 states and three Canadian provinces, operating more than 300 trains each day over   of track. 

Pope Fabian<====>51929<====>Pope Fabian Fabian ( ; c.  200 – 20 January 250) was the Bishop of Rome from 10 January 236 to his death in 250, Meier, Gabriel (1909).  "Pope St.  Fabian" in The Catholic Encyclopedia.  Vol.  5.  New York: Robert Appleton Company.   succeeding Anterus.  He is famous for the miraculous nature of his election, in which a dove is said to have descended on his head to mark him as the Holy Spirit's unexpected choice to become the next pope.He was succeeded by Cornelius. Most of his papacy was characterized by amicable relations with the imperial government, and Fabian could thus bring back to Rome the bodies of Pope Pontian and the antipope Hippolytus, both of whom had died in exile in the Sardinian mines, for Christian burial. 

Kinetic energy penetrator<====>51932<====>Kinetic energy penetrator A kinetic energy penetrator (KEP, KE weapon, long-rod penetrator or LRP) is a type of ammunition designed to penetrate vehicle armour.  Like a bullet, this ammunition does not contain explosives and uses kinetic energy to penetrate the target.  Modern KEP munitions are typically of the armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) type. HistoryEarly cannons fired kinetic energy ammunition, initially consisting of round balls of worked stone and later of round balls of metal.  From the beginning, combining high muzzle energy with projectile density and hardness have been the foremost factors in the design of such weapons. 

Martin Dunwoody<====>51934<====>Martin Dunwoody  Martin John Dunwoody (born 3 November 1938) is an emeritus professor of Mathematics at the University of Southampton, England. He earned his Ph. D.  in 1964 from the Australian National University.  He held positions at the University of Sussex before becoming professor at the University of Southampton in 1992.  He has been emeritus professor since 2003. Dunwoody works on geometric group theory and low-dimensional topology.  He is a leading expert in splittings and accessibility of discrete groups, Groups acting on graphs and trees, JSJ-decompositions, the topology of 3-manifolds and the structure of their fundamental groups. 

Hymenophore<====>51937<====>HymenophoreA hymenophore refers to the hymenium-bearing structure of a fungal fruiting body. Hymenophores can be smooth surfaces, lamellae, folds, tubes, or teeth. The term was coined by Robert Hooke in 1665. 

Hymenomycete<====>51938<====>Hymenomycete Hymenomycetes was the largest class of fungi within the division Basidiomycota, but the term is no longer taxonomically relevant.  Many familiar fungi belong to this class, including bracket fungi and toadstools.This class contains the orders Agaricales, Boletales, and Russulales. Formerly a taxonomic group of basidiomycetes, now understood as polyphyletic assemblage of basidiomycetes, the term refers to fungi with fruit bodies whose hymenophore develops either not enclosed or only so with a veil (velum), which is called a gymnocarpic or hemiangiocarpic ontogeny, respectively.  Puffballs, on the other hand, have gasterocarpic development (hymenophore enclosed). 

Waveplate<====>51940<====>WaveplateA waveplate or retarder is an optical device that alters the polarization state of a light wave travelling through it.  Two common types of waveplates are the half-wave plate, which shifts the polarization direction of linearly polarized light, and the quarter-wave plate, which converts linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light and vice versa.A quarter-wave plate can be used to produce elliptical polarization as well. Waveplates are constructed out of a birefringent material (such as quartz or mica), for which the index of refraction is different for different orientations of light passing through it. 

Carlsbad<====>51943<====>CarlsbadCarlsbad may refer to:Carlsbad, California, United StatesCarlsbad, New Mexico, United StatesCarlsbad, Texas, United StatesKarlovy Vary, Czech Republic; formerly known as CarlsbadSee alsoCarlsbad Caverns National ParkCarlsbad DecreesCarlsbad Springs, OntarioCarlsbad State BeachHC Energie Karlovy VaryWest Baden Springs HotelKarlsbad (disambiguation) 

Dichroism<====>51944<====>Dichroism In optics, a dichroic material is either one which causes visible light to be split up into distinct beams of different wavelengths (colours) (not to be confused with dispersion), or one in which light rays having different polarizations are absorbed by different amounts.  In beam splitters The original meaning of dichroic, from the Greek dikhroos, two-coloured, refers to any optical device which can split a beam of light into two beams with differing wavelengths.  Such devices include mirrors and filters, usually treated with optical coatings, which are designed to reflect light over a certain range of wavelengths, and transmit light which is outside that range. 

Alexander Trocchi<====>51945<====>Alexander Trocchi    Alexander Whitelaw Robertson Trocchi (   ; 30 July 1925 – 15 April 1984) was a Scottish novelist. Early careerTrocchi was born in Glasgow to a Scottish mother and Italian father.  After working as a seaman on the Murmansk convoys, he attended the University of Glasgow.  On graduation he obtained a travelling grant that enabled him to relocate to continental Europe.  In the early 1950s he lived in Paris and edited the literary magazine Merlin, which published Henry Miller, Samuel Beckett, Christopher Logue, and Pablo Neruda, amongst others.  Although not published in Merlin, American writer Terry Southern, who lived in Paris from 1948−1952, became a close friend of both Trocchi and his colleague Richard Seaver, and the three later co-edited the anthology Writers In Revolt (1962). 

Roosevelt Island<====>51946<====>Roosevelt IslandRoosevelt Island is a narrow island in New York City's East River.

I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue<====>51953<====>I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue   I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue is a BBC radio comedy panel game.  Introduced as "the antidote to panel games", it consists of two teams of two comedians "given silly things to do" by a chairman.  The show launched in April 1972 as a parody of radio and TV panel games, and has been broadcast since on BBC Radio 4 and the BBC World Service, with repeats aired on BBC Radio 4 Extra.  The 50th series was broadcast in November and December 2007.  After a period of split chairmanship in the first series,   ("Barry Cryer, a regular panellist, who shared the chairman's duties with Lyttleton in the first series. 

Distribution (mathematics)<====>51955<====>Distribution (mathematics) Distributions (or generalized functions) are objects that generalize the classical notion of functions in mathematical analysis.   Distributions make it possible to differentiate functions whose derivatives do not exist in the classical sense.   In particular, any locally integrable function has a distributional derivative.   Distributions are widely used in the theory of partial differential equations, where it may be easier to establish the existence of distributional solutions than classical solutions, or appropriate classical solutions may not exist.  Distributions are also important in physics and engineering where many problems naturally lead to differential equations whose solutions or initial conditions are distributions, such as the Dirac delta function (which is a distribution, not merely a function as its historical name might suggest). 

Mornington Crescent (game)<====>51959<====>Mornington Crescent (game)  Mornington Crescent is a game featured in the BBC Radio 4 comedy panel show I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue, a series which satirises panel games.    The game consists of each panellist in turn announcing a landmark or street, most often a tube station on the London Underground system.  The aim is to be the first to announce "Mornington Crescent", a station on the Northern line.   Interspersed with the turns is humorous discussion amongst the panellists and host regarding the rules and legality of each move, as well as the strategy the panellists are using. 

Vulgar Latin<====>51962<====>Vulgar Latin   Vulgar Latin or Sermo Vulgaris ("common speech") was the nonstandard form(s) of Latin (as opposed to classical or refined or 'proper' literary version of the language) spoken in the Mediterranean region during and after the classical period of the Roman Empire.  It is from Vulgar Latin that the Romance languages developed; the best known are the national languages Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, and French.  Works written in Latin during classical times and the earlier Middle Ages used Classical Latin rather than Vulgar Latin, with very few exceptions (most notably sections of Gaius Petronius' Satyricon).

Weaving<====>51970<====>Weaving Weaving is a method of textile production   in which two distinct sets of yarns or threads are interlaced at right angles to form a fabric or cloth.  Other methods are knitting, crocheting, felting, and braiding or plaiting.  The longitudinal threads are called the warp and the lateral threads are the weft or filling.  (Weft or woof is an old English word meaning "that which is woven".  ) The method in which these threads are inter-woven affects the characteristics of the cloth.    Cloth is usually woven on a loom, a device that holds the warp threads in place while filling threads are woven through them.

Models of deafness<====>51984<====>Models of deafness   Various models of deafness are rooted in either the social or biological sciences.  These are the medical (or infirmity) model, the social model, and the cultural model.  The model used can affect how deaf persons are treated and their identity.   In the medical model, deafness is viewed as an undesirable condition, to be so treated.   Within the social model, the design of the deaf person's environment is viewed as the major disabling factor.   In the cultural model, the Deaf belong to a culture in which they are neither infirm nor disabled.

Shiritori<====>52012<====>Shiritori  is a Japanese word game in which the players are required to say a word which begins with the final kana of the previous word.  No distinction is made between hiragana, katakana or kanji.   "Shiritori" literally means "taking the end" or "taking the rear".    Basic rulesTwo or more people take turns to play. Only nouns are permitted. A player who plays a word ending in the mora N (ん) loses the game, as no Japanese word begins with that character. Words may not be repeated. Phrases connected by no (の) are permitted, but only in those cases where the phrase is sufficiently fossilized to be considered a "word". 

Proper motion<====>52015<====>Proper motion Proper motion is the astronomical measure of the observed changes in the apparent places of stars in the sky, as seen from the center of mass of the Solar System, compared to the abstract background of the more distant stars.    The components of proper motion in the equatorial coordinate system (of a given epoch, usually J2000. 0) are measured in seconds of time for right ascension (RA or α) and seconds of arc in declination (dec.  or δ).  Their combined value is computed as the total proper motion (μ),    which is expressed in arcseconds per year (arcsec/yr) or per century (arcsec/100 yr), where 3600 arcseconds equal one degree.

Mathematical optimization<====>52033<====>Mathematical optimization  In mathematics, computer science and operations research, mathematical optimization or mathematical programming, alternatively spelled optimisation, is the selection of a best element (with regard to some criterion) from some set of available alternatives.  In the simplest case, an optimization problem consists of maximizing or minimizing a real function by systematically choosing input values from within an allowed set and computing the value of the function.  The generalization of optimization theory and techniques to other formulations constitutes a large area of applied mathematics.  More generally, optimization includes finding "best available" values of some objective function given a defined domain (or input), including a variety of different types of objective functions and different types of domains.

He was a prolific scholar and church leader, who today is most famous for his identification of the genuine letters of the church father, Ignatius, and for his chronology that sought to establish the time and date of the creation as "the entrance of the night preceding the 23rd day of October. . .  the year before Christ 4004"; that is, around 6 pm on 22 October 4004   according to the proleptic Julian calendar. 

Motion compensation<====>52035<====>Motion compensation Motion compensation is an algorithmic technique used to predict a frame in a video, given the previous and/or future frames by accounting for motion of the camera and/or objects in the video.  It is employed in the encoding of video data for video compression, for example in the generation of MPEG-2 files.  Motion compensation describes a picture in terms of the transformation of a reference picture to the current picture.  The reference picture may be previous in time or even from the future.  When images can be accurately synthesised from previously transmitted/stored images, the compression efficiency can be improved.

Jonathan Edwards (theologian)<====>52057<====>Jonathan Edwards (theologian)  Jonathan  Edwards (October 5, 1703 – March 22, 1758) was an American revivalist preacher, philosopher, and Congregationalist Protestant theologian.  Like most of the Puritans, he held to the Reformed theology.  His colonial followers later distinguished themselves from other Congregationalists as "New Lights" (endorsing the Great Awakening), as opposed to "Old Lights" (non-revivalists).  Edwards is widely regarded as "one of America's most important and original philosophical theologians".  Edwards' theological work is broad in scope, but he was rooted in Reformed theology, the metaphysics of theological determinism, and the Puritan heritage.  Recent studies have emphasized how thoroughly Edwards grounded his life's work on conceptions of beauty, harmony, and ethical fittingness, and how central The Enlightenment was to his mindset. 

Arch<====>52070<====>Arch  An arch is a curved structure that spans an elevated space and may or may not support the weight above it.  Arches may be synonymous with vaults, but a vault may be distinguished as a continuous arch  forming a roof.  Arches appeared as early as the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamian brick architecture,  and their systematic use started with the ancient Romans, who were the first to apply the technique to a wide range of structures. Basic conceptsAn arch is a pure compression form.  It can span a large area by resolving forces into compressive stresses and, in turn eliminating tensile stresses.

Vibrio cholerae<====>52080<====>Vibrio cholerae Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative, comma-shaped bacterium.  The bacterium's natural habitat is brackish or saltwater.  Some strains of V.  cholerae cause the disease cholera.  V.  cholerae is a  facultative anaerobe    and has a flagellum at one cell pole as well as pili.  V.  cholerae can undergo respiratory and fermentative metabolism.  When ingested, V.  cholerae can cause diarrhea and vomiting in a host within several hours to 2–3 days of ingestion.  V.  cholerae was first isolated as the cause of cholera by Italian anatomist Filippo Pacini in 1854, See:Filippo Pacini (1854) "Osservazioni microscopiche e deduzioni patologiche sul cholera asiatico" (Microscopic observations and pathological deductions on Asiatic cholera), Gazzetta by tiadwe Medica Italiana:  Toscana, 2nd series, 4 (50) :  397-401 ; 4 (51) : 405-412. 

Antihydrogen<====>52081<====>Antihydrogen Antihydrogen ( ) is the antimatter counterpart of hydrogen.  Whereas the common hydrogen atom is composed of an electron and proton, the antihydrogen atom is made up of a positron and antiproton.    Scientists hope studying antihydrogen may shed light on the question of why there is more matter than antimatter in the universe, known as the baryon asymmetry problem.   Antihydrogen is produced artificially in particle accelerators.  In 1999, NASA gave a cost estimate of $62. 5 billion per gram of antihydrogen (equivalent to $  billion today), making it the most expensive material to produce. 

Cable transport<====>52082<====>Cable transport Cable transport is a broad class of transport modes that have cables as the foundation for transporting things or people, often in vehicles called cable cars.  The cable may be driven or passive; items may be moved by pulling, sliding, sailing, or by drives within the object being moved on cableways.  The use of pulleys and balancing of loads going up and down are common elements of cable transport. They are also used in mountainous areas. Common modes of cable transport are:Aerial lifts, such as:Aerial tramwayChairliftFunitelGondola liftSki liftZip lineSurface lifts, such as:Cable carCable ferryFunicularSurface liftVertical lifts, such as:ElevatorHistoryCable drawn transport has been known of since at least 250 B. 

Protein folding<====>52085<====>Protein folding  Protein folding is the physical process by which a protein chain acquires its native 3-dimensional structure, a conformation that is usually biologically functional, in an expeditious and reproducible manner.  It is the physical process by which a polypeptide folds into its characteristic and functional three-dimensional structure from random coil.    Each protein exists as an unfolded polypeptide or random coil when translated from a sequence of mRNA to a linear chain of amino acids.  This polypeptide lacks any stable (long-lasting) three-dimensional structure (the left hand side of the first figure).  As the polypeptide chain is being synthesized by the ribosome, the linear chain begins to fold into its three dimensional structure. 

Word play<====>52086<====>Word play  Word play or wordplay  (also: play-on-words) is a literary technique and a form of wit in which the words that are used become the main subject of the work, primarily for the purpose of intended effect or amusement.  Examples of word play include puns, phonetic mix-ups such as spoonerisms, obscure words and meanings, clever rhetorical excursions, oddly formed sentences, double entendres, and telling character names (such as in the play The Importance of Being Earnest, Ernest being a given name that sounds exactly like the adjective earnest). Word play is quite common in oral cultures as a method of reinforcing meaning. 

Osvaldo Ardiles<====>52088<====>Osvaldo Ardiles  Osvaldo César Ardiles (born 3 August 1952), often referred to in Britain as Ossie Ardiles,  is a football manager, pundit and former midfielder who won the 1978 FIFA World Cup as part of the Argentine national team.  He now runs his own football school in the UK called the Ossie Ardiles Soccer School. A competitive and skilled midfielder, Ardiles became a cult hero in England, along with Glenn Hoddle and compatriot Ricardo Villa, as a player for Tottenham Hotspur.  He left England for a period on loan as a result of the outbreak of the Falklands War in 1982, thus missing most of the 1982–83 English season. 

Fictionary<====>52097<====>FictionaryFictionary, also known as The Dictionary Game or simply Dictionary, is a word game in which players guess the definition of an obscure word.  Each round consists of one player selecting and announcing a word from the dictionary, and other players composing a fake definition for it.  The definitions are collected by the selector and read aloud, and players vote on which definition they believe to be correct.  Points are awarded for correct guesses, and for having a fake definition guessed by another player. GameplayThe game requires a large and preferably unabridged dictionary, a pencil, pen or other writing implement for each player, and notecards or identical pieces of paper for each player. 

Word game<====>52098<====>Word game  Word games  (also called word game puzzles) are spoken or board games often designed to test ability with language or to explore its properties. Word games are generally engaged as a source of entertainment, but have been found to serve an educational purpose as well.  For instance, young children can find enjoyment playing modestly competitive games such as Hangman, while naturally developing important language skills like spelling.  Solving crossword puzzles, which requires familiarity with a larger vocabulary, is a pastime that mature adults have long credited with keeping their minds sharp. There are popular televised word games with valuable monetary prizes for the winning contestants. 

Charades<====>52100<====>Charades Charades ( ,  )  .   is a parlor or party word guessing game.  Originally, the game was a dramatic form of literary charades: a single person would act out each syllable of a word or phrase in order, followed by the whole phrase together, while the rest of the group guessed.  A variant was to have teams who acted scenes out together while the others guessed.  Today, it is common to require the actors to mime their hints without using any spoken words, which requires some conventional gestures.  Puns and visual puns were and remain common. 

Prose<====>52103<====>Prose  Prose is a form of language that exhibits a natural flow of speech and grammatical structure rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry, where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme. BackgroundThere are critical debates on the construction of prose: ". . .  the distinction between verse and prose is clear, the distinction between poetry and prose is obscure".   Prose in its simplicity and loosely defined structure is broadly adaptable to spoken dialogue, factual discourse, and to topical and fictional writing.  It is systematically produced and published within literature, journalism (including newspapers, magazines, and broadcasting), encyclopedias, film, history, philosophy, law, and in almost all forms and processes requiring human communications. 

Albany, New York<====>52106<====>Albany, New York    Albany (   ) is the capital of the U. S.  state of New York and the seat of Albany County.  Roughly   north of New York City, Albany developed on the west bank of the Hudson River, about   south of its confluence with the Mohawk River.  The population of the City of Albany was 97,856 according to the 2010 census.  Albany constitutes the economic and cultural core of the Capital District of New York State, which comprises the Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area, including the nearby cities and suburbs of Troy, Schenectady, and Saratoga Springs. 

Cree<====>52107<====>CreeThe Cree ( ;  ) are one of the largest groups of First Nations in North America, with over 200,000 members living in Canada.  The major proportion of Cree in Canada live north and west of Lake Superior, in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the Northwest Territories.  About 38,000 live in Quebec.  In the United States, this Algonquian-speaking people historically lived from Lake Superior westward.  Today, they live mostly in Montana, where they share a reservation with the Ojibwe (Chippewa).    The documented westward migration over time has been strongly associated with their roles as traders and hunters in the North American fur trade. 

General Dynamics<====>52108<====>General Dynamics General Dynamics Corporation (GD) is an American aerospace and defense multinational corporation formed by mergers and divestitures.  It is the world's fifth-largest defense contractor based on 2012 revenues.  "Defense News Top 100 for 2012"  .  Defense News, July 22, 2013.    General Dynamics is headquartered in West Falls Church, Fairfax County, Virginia.    The company has changed markedly in the post–Cold War era of defense consolidation.  It has four main business segments: Marine Systems, Combat Systems, Information Systems Technology, and Aerospace.  General Dynamics' former Fort Worth Division manufactured the F-16 Fighting Falcon until 1993, which was one of the Western world's most-produced jet fighters. 

John C. Calhoun<====>52110<====>John C.  CalhounJohn Caldwell Calhoun ( ;  March 18, 1782 March 31, 1850) was an American statesman and political theorist from South Carolina, and the seventh Vice President of the United States from 1825 to 1832.  He is remembered for strongly defending slavery and for advancing the concept of minority rights in politics, which he did in the context of defending white Southern interests from perceived Northern threats.  He began his political career as a nationalist, modernizer, and proponent of a strong national government and protective tariffs.  By the late 1820s, his views reversed and he became a leading proponent of states' rights, limited government, nullification, and opposition to high tariffs—he saw Northern acceptance of these policies as the only way to keep the South in the Union. 

Vice president<====>52113<====>Vice president  A vice president (in British English: vice-president for governments and director for businesses) is an officer in government or business who is below a president (managing director) in rank.  It can also refer to executive vice presidents, signifying that the VP is on the executive branch of the government, university or company.  The name comes from the Latin vice meaning "in place of".   In some countries, the vice president is called the deputy president.  In everyday speech, the abbreviation VP can be used. In government In government, a vice president is a person whose primary responsibility is to act in place of the president on the event of the president's death, resignation or incapacity. 

Algonquian languages<====>52115<====>Algonquian languages The Algonquian languages (  or  ; also Algonkian) are a subfamily of Native American languages which includes most of the languages in the Algic language family.  The name of the Algonquian language family is distinguished from the orthographically similar Algonquin dialect of the indigenous Ojibwe language (Chippewa), which is a senior member of the Algonquian language family.  The term "Algonquin" has been suggested to derive from the Maliseet word elakómkwik (pronounced  ), "they are our relatives/allies".A number of Algonquian languages, like many other Native American languages, are now extinct. 

Bessie Smith<====>52116<====>Bessie Smith Bessie Smith (April 15, 1894 – September 26, 1937) was an American blues singer.  Nicknamed the Empress of the Blues, she was the most popular female blues singer of the 1920s and 1930s.   She is often regarded as one of the greatest singers of her era and was a major influence on other jazz singers.  LifeThe 1900 census indicates that her family reported that Bessie Smith was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in July 1892. The 1910 census gives her age as 16,  and a birth date of April 15, 1894 appears on subsequent documents and was observed as her birthday by the Smith family. 

Embedding<====>52119<====>Embedding  In mathematics, an embedding (or imbedding ) is one instance of some mathematical structure contained within another instance, such as a group that is a subgroup. When some object X is said to be embedded in another object Y, the embedding is given by some injective and structure-preserving map  .  The precise meaning of "structure-preserving" depends on the kind of mathematical structure of which X and Y are instances.  In the terminology of category theory, a structure-preserving map is called a morphism. The fact that a map   is an embedding is often indicated by the use of a "hooked arrow" ( );    thus:   f : X \hookrightarrow Y. 

Strabo<====>52121<====>Strabo  Strabo  ( ;   Strábōn; 64 or 63 BC   AD 24) was a Greek geographer, philosopher, and historian who lived in Asia Minor during the transitional period of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. LifeStrabo was born to an affluent family from Amaseia in Pontus (modern Amasya, Turkey),  a city that he said was situated the approximate equivalent of 75 km from the Black Sea.  Pontus had recently fallen to the Roman Republic, and although politically he was a proponent of Roman imperialism, Strabo belonged on his mother's side to a prominent family whose members had held important positions under the previous resisting regime of King Mithridates VI of Pontus.

VHS<====>52124<====>VHS  The Video Home System(VHS)    is a standard for consumer-level analog video recording on tape cassettes.  Developed by Victor Company of Japan (JVC) in the early 1970s, it was released in Japan in late 1976 and in the United States in early 1977. From the 1950s, magnetic tape video recording became a major contributor to the television industry, via the first commercialized video tape recorders (VTRs).  At that time, the devices were used only in expensive professional environments such as television studios and medical imaging (fluoroscopy).

After confirming some privileges to the Catholic Church, he is crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, by Pope Stephen V.   Berengar is forced to retreat to Verona; Guy does not pursue him into Friuli, because of the (possible) wrath of King Arnulf of Carinthia. 

Pneumonia<====>52135<====>PneumoniaPneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the small air sacs known as alveoli.   Typically symptoms include some combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and trouble breathing.Severity is variable.   Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications and conditions such as autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include other lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, and asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke, or a weak immune system. 

Citrus<====>52136<====>Citrus  Citrus is a genus of flowering trees and shrubs in the rue family, Rutaceae.  Plants in the genus produce citrus fruits, including important crops like oranges, lemons, grapefruit, pomelo and limes. The most recent research indicates an origin in Australia, New Caledonia and New Guinea.   Some researchers believe that the origin is in the part of Southeast Asia bordered by Northeast India, Burma (Myanmar) and the Yunnan province of China,    and it is in this region that some commercial species such as oranges, mandarins, and lemons originated.  Citrus fruit has been cultivated in an ever-widening area since ancient times.

They are found widely around the world in both fresh and salt water. BiologyCarideans are found in every kind of aquatic habitat, with the majority of species being marine.  Around a quarter of the described species are found in fresh water, however, including almost all the members of the species-rich family Atyidae and the Palaemonidae subfamily Palaemoninae.They include several commercially important species, such as Macrobrachium rosenbergii, and are found on every continent except Antarctica.   The marine species are found at depths to  ,    and from the tropics to the polar regions. 

Audrey Hepburn<====>52139<====>Audrey Hepburn   Audrey Hepburn ( ; born Audrey Kathleen Ruston; 4 May 1929 20 January 1993) was a British  actress, model, dancer and humanitarian.  Recognised as a film and fashion icon, Hepburn was active during Hollywood's Golden Age.  She was ranked by the American Film Institute as the third-greatest female screen legend in Golden Age Hollywood and was inducted into the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame. Born in Ixelles, a district of Brussels, Hepburn spent her childhood between Belgium, England and the Netherlands.  In Amsterdam, she studied ballet with Sonia Gaskell before moving to London in 1948, continuing her ballet training with Marie Rambert, and then performing as a chorus girl in West End musical theatre productions. 

United Nations Iraq–Kuwait Observation Mission<====>52140<====>United Nations Iraq–Kuwait Observation Mission The United Nations Iraq–Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) was established on April 9, 1991 following the Gulf War by Security Council Resolution 689 (1991) and fully deployed by early May 1991. The task of the 300 military observers was to monitor the demilitarized zone (DMZ) along the Iraq-Kuwait border and the Khawr 'Abd Allah waterway, deter border violations and report any hostile action.  On February 5, 1993, under Security Council Resolution 806, the mandate was extended to include physical action to prevent violations and the force was expanded to an intended three mechanized infantry battalions plus support. 

Inversion (meteorology)<====>52141<====>Inversion (meteorology) In meteorology, an  inversion  is a deviation from the normal change of an atmospheric property with altitude.   It almost always refers to a inversion of the thermal lapse rate, measured by radiosonde.  Air temperature increases with height to the inversion height  . An inversion traps air pollution, such as smog, close to the ground.  An inversion can also suppress convection by acting as a "cap".  If this cap is broken for any of several reasons, convection of any moisture present can then erupt into violent thunderstorms.  Temperature inversion can notoriously result in freezing rain in cold climates. 

Megacity<====>52143<====>Megacity   A megacity is usually defined as a metropolitan area with a total population in excess of ten million people.   A megacity can be a single metropolitan area or two or more metropolitan areas that converge.  The terms conurbation, metropolis and metroplex are also applied to the latter. As of 2017, there are 47 megacities in existence.  The largest of these are the metropolitan areas of Tokyo, Shanghai and Jakarta, each having a population of over 30 million inhabitants.  The United States has two megacities; the metropolitan areas of New York City and Los Angeles. 

Gabriel Lamé<====>52145<====>Gabriel Lamé  Gabriel Lamé (22 July 1795 – 1 May 1870) was a French mathematician who contributed to the theory of partial differential equations by the use of curvilinear coordinates, and the mathematical theory of elasticity. BiographyLamé was born in Tours, in today's département of Indre-et-Loire. He became well known for his general theory of curvilinear coordinates and his notation and study of classes of ellipse-like curves, now known as Lamé curves or superellipses, and defined by the equation:  \left|\,{x\over a}\,\right|^n + \left|\,{y\over b}\,\right|^n =1  where n is any positive real number. He is also known for his running time analysis of the Euclidean algorithm, marking the beginning of computational complexity theory. 

Julius Plücker<====>52146<====>Julius Plücker Julius Plücker (16 June 1801 – 22 May 1868) was a German mathematician and physicist.  He made fundamental contributions to the field of analytical geometry and was a pioneer in the investigations of cathode rays that led eventually to the discovery of the electron.  He also vastly extended the study of Lamé curves. Biography Early yearsPlücker was born at Elberfeld (now part of Wuppertal).  After being educated at Düsseldorf and at the universities of Bonn, Heidelberg and Berlin he went to Paris in 1823, where he came under the influence of the great school of French geometers, whose founder, Gaspard Monge, had only recently died. 

Sawtooth wave<====>52147<====>Sawtooth wave The sawtooth wave (or saw wave) is a kind of non-sinusoidal waveform.  It is so named based on its resemblance to the teeth of a plain-toothed saw with a zero rake angle. The convention is that a sawtooth wave ramps upward and then sharply drops .  However, in a "reverse (or inverse) sawtooth wave", the wave ramps downward and then sharply rises.  It can also be considered the extreme case of an asymmetric triangle wave.  The piecewise linear function x(t) = t - \underbrace{\lfloor t \rfloor}_{\operatorname{floor}(t)} or x(t) = t  \pmod {1} based on the floor function of time t is an example of a sawtooth wave with period 1. 

Battle of Covadonga<====>52150<====>Battle of Covadonga   The Battle of Covadonga was the first victory by Christendom military forces in Iberia since the Islamic conquest of Hispania in 711–718.  It was fought at Covadonga, most likely in the summer of 722.  The battle followed the creation in 718 of an independent Christian principality in the mountains of the northwestern region of the Iberian peninsula that grew into the Kingdom of Asturias and became a bastion of Christian resistance to the expansion of Muslim rule.  As a result, the Battle of Covadonga has been credited by historians with catalyzing the   or the "reconquest" of Christian rule to the entire peninsula. 

Triangle wave<====>52151<====>Triangle wave  A triangle wave is a non-sinusoidal waveform named for its triangular shape.   It is a periodic, piecewise linear, continuous real function. Like a square wave, the triangle wave contains only odd harmonics.   However, the higher harmonics roll off much faster than in a square wave (proportional to the inverse square of the harmonic number as opposed to just the inverse). HarmonicsIt is possible to approximate a triangle wave with additive synthesis by summing odd harmonics of the fundamental while multiplying every other odd harmonic by −1 (or, equivalently, changing its phase by π) and multiplying the amplitude of the harmonics by one over the square of their mode number,  , (which is equivalent to one over the square of their relative frequency to the fundamental). 

Cree language<====>52153<====>Cree language   Cree    (also known as Cree–Montagnais–Naskapi) is a dialect continuum of Algonquian languages spoken by approximately 117,000 people across Canada, from the Northwest Territories to Alberta to Labrador   .  If classified as one language, it is the Aboriginal language with the highest number of speakers in Canada.  Statistics Canada: 2006 Census    The only region where Cree has any official status is in the Northwest Territories, alongside eight other aboriginal languages.   The places that Cree is spoken are mainly in Fort Smith and Hay River Government of the Northwest Territories.

Grook<====>52167<====>Grook A grook ("gruk" in Danish) is a form of short aphoristic poem or rhyming aphorism, created by the Danish poet, designer, inventor and scientist Piet Hein, who wrote over 7000 of them, mostly in Danish or English.  They have been published in 20 volumes.   Some say that the name is short for "GRin & sUK" ("laugh & sigh" in Danish), but Piet Hein said he felt that the word had come out of thin air.

Dendrobranchiata<====>52171<====>Dendrobranchiata Dendrobranchiata is a suborder of decapod shrimps, commonly known as prawns.  There are 540 extant species in seven families, and a fossil record extending back to the Devonian.  They differ from related animals, such as Caridea and Stenopodidea, by the branching form of the gills and by the fact that they do not brood their eggs, but release them directly into the water.  They may reach a length of over   and a mass of  , and are widely fished and farmed for human consumption. Shrimp and prawnsWhile Dendrobranchiata and Caridea belong to different suborders of Decapoda, they are very similar in appearance, and in many contexts such as commercial farming and fisheries, they are both often referred to as "shrimp" and "prawn" interchangeably. 

Natantia<====>52172<====>NatantiaNatantia (Boas, 1880) is an obsolete taxon of decapod crustaceans, comprising those families that move predominantly by swimming – the shrimp (comprising Caridea and Procarididea), prawns (Dendrobranchiata) and boxer shrimp.  The remaining Decapoda were placed in the Reptantia, and consisted of crabs, lobsters and other large animals that move chiefly by walking along the bottom.The division between Natantia and Reptantia was replaced in 1963, when Martin Burkenroad erected the suborder Pleocyemata for those animals that brood their eggs on the pleopods, leaving Dendrobranchiata for the prawns.   Under this system, Natantia is a paraphyletic group.

Jean Racine<====>52201<====>Jean Racine    Jean Racine ( ), baptismal name Jean-Baptiste Racine (22 December 1639 21 April 1699), was a French dramatist, one of the three great playwrights of 17th-century France (along with Molière and Corneille), and an important literary figure in the Western tradition.  Racine was primarily a tragedian, producing such "examples of neoclassical perfection"  as Phèdre,  Andromaque,  and Athalie,  although he did write one comedy, Les Plaideurs,  and a muted tragedy,  Esther, for the young. Racine's plays displayed his mastery of the dodecasyllabic alexandrine; he is renowned for elegance, purity, speed, and fury,  Iphigenia; Phaedra; Athaliah - Google Books   and for what Robert Lowell described as a "diamond-edge",  and the "glory of its hard, electric rage". 

Magic square<====>52202<====>Magic squareIn recreational mathematics, a magic square  is a  n\times n  square grid (where  n  is the number of cells on each side) filled with distinct positive integers in the range  1,2,. . . ,n^2  such that each cell contains a different integer and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal.    The sum is called the magic constant or magic sum of the magic square.  A square grid with  n  cells on each side is said to have order n. In regard to magic sum, the problem of magic squares only requires the sum of each row, column and diagonal to be equal, it does not require the sum to be a particular value. 

Nanowire<====>52206<====>Nanowire A nanowire is a nanostructure, with the diameter of the order of a nanometer (10 −9  meters).  It can also be defined as the ratio of the length to width being greater than 1000.  Alternatively, nanowires can be defined as structures that have a thickness or diameter constrained to tens of nanometers or less and an unconstrained length.  At these scales, quantum mechanical effects are important — which coined the term "quantum wires".  Many different types of nanowires exist, including superconducting (e. g.  YBCO ), metallic (e. g.  Ni, Pt, Au), semiconducting (e.

The group composed and made the first recordings of many jazz standards, the most famous being "Tiger Rag".  In late 1917 the spelling of the band's name was changed to Original Dixieland Jazz Band. The band consisted of five musicians who had played in the Papa Jack Laine bands, a racially integrated group of musicians who played for parades, dances, and advertising in New Orleans. 

Free-rider problem<====>52217<====>Free-rider problem In economics, the free-rider problem occurs when those who benefit from resources, goods, or services do not pay for them, which results in an underprovision of those goods or services.For example, a free-rider may frequently ask for available parking lots (public goods) from the ones who have already paid for them, in order to benefit from free parking.  At the end of the day, one may see that the free-rider have used the parking even more than the others without paying a single penny.  The free-rider problem is the question of how to limit free riding and its negative effects in these situations. 

Corporate welfare<====>52221<====>Corporate welfareCorporate welfare is a term that analogizes corporate subsidies to welfare payments for the poor.The term is often used to describe a government's bestowal of money grants, tax breaks, or other special favorable treatment for corporations.  It highlights how wealthy corporations are less in need of such treatment than the poor.  The definition of corporate welfare is sometimes restricted to direct government subsidies of major corporations, excluding tax loopholes and all manner of regulatory and trade decisions, which, in practice, could be worth much more than any direct subsidies. Origin of termThe term "corporate welfare" was reportedly invented in 1956 by Ralph Nader.

Touring car racing<====>52243<====>Touring car racing  Touring car racing is an auto racing competition with heavily modified road-going cars.   It is popular in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Britain, Germany, Sweden and Norway. While not as fast as Formula One, the similarity of the cars both to each other and to fans' own vehicles makes for entertaining, well-supported racing.  The lesser use of aerodynamics means following cars have a much easier time passing than in F1, and the more substantial bodies of the cars makes the occasional nudging for overtaking much more acceptable as part of racing. As well as short "sprint" races, many touring car series include one or more endurance races, which last anything from 3 to 24 hours and are a test of reliability and pit crews as much as car, driver speed and consistency. 

Sports car racing<====>52244<====>Sports car racing  Sports car racing is a form of circuit auto racing with sports cars that have two seats and enclosed wheels.  They may be purpose-built (Prototype) or related to road-going models (Grand Touring). A type of hybrid between the purism of open-wheelers and the familiarity of touring car racing, this style is often associated with the annual Le Mans 24 Hours endurance race.  First run in 1923, Le Mans is one of the oldest motor races still in existence.   Other classic but now defunct sports car races include the Italian classics, the Targa Florio (1906–1977) and Mille Miglia (1927–1957), and the Mexican Carrera Panamericana (1950-1954). 

Rallying<====>52245<====>Rallying Rallying is a form of motorsport that takes place on public or private roads with modified production or specially built road-legal cars.  It is distinguished by running not on a circuit, but instead in a point-to-point format in which participants and their co-drivers drive between set control points (special stages), leaving at regular intervals from one or more start points.  Rallies may be won by pure speed within the stages or alternatively by driving to a predetermined ideal journey time within the stages. HistoryPre-World War I eraThe term "rally", as a branch of motorsport, probably dates from the first Monte Carlo Rally of January 1911. 

Alfred Jodl<====>52246<====>Alfred Jodl  Alfred Josef Ferdinand Jodl ( ; 10 May 1890 – 16 October 1946) was a German general during World War II, who served as the Chief of the Operations Staff of the Armed Forces High Command (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht). After the war, Jodl was indicted on the charges of conspiracy to commit crime against peace; planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression; war crimes; and crimes against humanity at the Allied-organised Nuremberg trials.  The principal charges against him related to his signature of the criminal Commando and Commissar Orders.  Found guilty on all charges, he was sentenced to death and executed in 1946. 

Fourier transform<====>52247<====>Fourier transform   The Fourier transform (FT) decomposes a function of time (a signal) into the frequencies that make it up, in a way similar to how a musical chord can be expressed as the frequencies (or pitches) of its constituent notes.  The Fourier transform of a function of time itself is a complex-valued function of frequency, whose absolute value represents the amount of that frequency present in the original function, and whose complex argument is the phase offset of the basic sinusoid in that frequency.  The Fourier transform is called the frequency domain representation of the original signal. 

Gujarati alphabet<====>52248<====>Gujarati alphabet  The Gujarati script (ગુજરાતી લિપિ Gujǎrātī Lipi) is an abugida, like all Nagari writing systems, and is used to write the Gujarati and Kutchi languages.  It is a variant of Devanagari script differentiated by the loss of the characteristic horizontal line running above the letters and by a number of modifications to some characters.

Eroticism<====>52357<====>Eroticism   Eroticism (from the Greek  ἔρως, eros—"desire") is a quality that causes sexual feelings,    as well as a philosophical contemplation concerning the aesthetics of sexual desire, sensuality and romantic love.  That quality may be found in any form of artwork, including painting, sculpture, photography, drama, film, music or literature.  It may also be found in advertising.  The term may also refer to a state of sexual arousal  or anticipation of such – an insistent sexual impulse, desire, or pattern of thoughts. As French novelist Honoré de Balzac stated, eroticism is dependent not just upon an individual's sexual morality, but also the culture and time in which an individual resides. 

Imaginary unit<====>52358<====>Imaginary unitThe imaginary unit or unit imaginary number ( ) is a solution to the quadratic equation  .   Although there is no real number with this property,   can be used to extend the real numbers to what are called complex numbers, using addition and multiplication.  A simple example of the use of   in a complex number is  . Imaginary numbers are an important mathematical concept, which extend the real number system   to the complex number system  , which in turn provides at least one root for every nonconstant polynomial  . 

Arapaho<====>52360<====>Arapaho  The Arapaho ( ; in French: Arapahos, Gens de Vache) are a tribe of Native Americans historically living on the plains of Colorado and Wyoming.  They were close allies of the Cheyenne tribe and loosely aligned with the Lakota and Dakota.  The Arapaho language, Heenetiit, is an Algonquian language closely related to Gros Ventre (Ahe/A'ananin), whose people are considered to have separated from the Arapaho at an early time.  The Blackfeet and Cheyenne also speak Algonquian languages, but theirs are quite different from Arapaho. By the 1850s, Arapaho bands formed two tribes: the Northern Arapaho and Southern Arapaho.

Titanic (1997 film)<====>52371<====>Titanic (1997 film)    Titanic is a 1997 American epic romance-disaster film directed, written, co-produced and co-edited by James Cameron.  A fictionalized account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, it stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. Cameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster.  Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. 

Center pivot irrigation<====>52373<====>Center pivot irrigationCenter-pivot irrigation (sometimes called central pivot irrigation), also called waterwheel and circle irrigation, is a method of crop irrigation in which equipment rotates around a pivot and crops are watered with sprinklers. A circular area centered on the pivot is irrigated, often creating a circular pattern in crops when viewed from above (sometimes referred to as crop circles).Most center pivots were initially water-powered, and today most are propelled by electric motors. HistoryCenter-pivot irrigation was invented in 1940by farmer Frank Zybach,    who lived in Strasburg, Colorado. 

Axiom of extensionality<====>52376<====>Axiom of extensionality In axiomatic set theory and the branches of logic, mathematics, and computer science that use it, the axiom of extensionality, or axiom of extension, is one of the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. Formal statementIn the formal language of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms, the axiom reads: \forall A \, \forall B \, ( \forall X \, (X \in A \iff X \in B) \Rightarrow A = B) or in words:Given any set A and any set B, if for every set X, X is a member of A if and only if X is a member of B, then A is equal to B.

Thermite<====>52381<====>Thermite  Thermite ( )   entry "thermite"  is a pyrotechnic composition of metal powder, which serves as fuel, and metal oxide.  When ignited by heat, thermite undergoes an exothermic reduction-oxidation (redox) reaction.  Most varieties are not explosive, but can create brief bursts of heat and high temperature in a small area.  Its form of action is similar to that of other fuel-oxidizer mixtures, such as black powder. Thermites have diverse compositions.  Fuels include aluminium, magnesium, titanium, zinc, silicon, and boron.  Aluminium is common because of its high boiling point and low cost. 

Watergate scandal<====>52382<====>Watergate scandal   The Watergate scandal was a major political scandal that occurred in the United States during the early 1970s, following a break-in by five men at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D. C.  on June 17, 1972, and President Richard Nixon's administration's subsequent attempt to cover up its involvement.  After the five burglars were caught and the conspiracy was discovered, Watergate was investigated by the United States Congress.  Meanwhile, Nixon's administration resisted its probes, which led to a constitutional crisis.  The term Watergate, by metonymy, has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration. 

Axiom of pairing<====>52385<====>Axiom of pairing In axiomatic set theory and the branches of logic, mathematics, and computer science that use it, the axiom of pairing is one of the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.  It was introduced by   as a special case of his axiom of elementary sets. Formal statementIn the formal language of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms, the axiom reads: \forall A \, \forall B \, \exists C \, \forall D \, [ D \in C \iff (D = A \or D = B)] or in words:Given any set A and any set B, there is a set C such that, given any set D, D is a member of C if and only if D is equal to A or D is equal to B. 

Axiom schema of specification<====>52386<====>Axiom schema of specification  In many popular versions of axiomatic set theory the axiom schema of specification, also known as the axiom schema of separation, subset axiom scheme or axiom schema of restricted comprehension is an axiom schema.   Essentially, it says that any definable subclass of a set is a set. Some mathematicians call it the axiom schema of comprehension, although others use that term for unrestricted comprehension, discussed below. Because restricting comprehension solved Russell's paradox, several mathematicians including Zermelo, Fraenkel, and Gödel considered it the most important axiom of set theory.    StatementOne instance of the schema is included for each formula φ in the language of set theory with free variables among x, w 1 , . 

Axiom schema of replacement<====>52387<====>Axiom schema of replacement In set theory, the axiom schema of replacement is a schema of axioms in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) that asserts that the image of any set under any definable mapping is also a set.  It is necessary for the construction of certain infinite sets in ZF. The axiom schema is motivated by the idea that whether a class is a set depends only on the cardinality of the class, not on the rank of its elements.  Thus, if one class is "small enough" to be a set, and there is a surjection from that class to a second class, the axiom states that the second class is also a set. 

Independence Day (1996 film)<====>52389<====>Independence Day (1996 film)   Independence Day is a 1996 American science fiction action film directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich.  The film focuses on disparate groups of people who converge in the Nevada desert in the aftermath of a worldwide attack by an extraterrestrial race of unknown origin.  With the other people of the world, they launch a last-ditch counterattack on July 4—Independence Day in the United States. While promoting Stargate in Europe, Emmerich came up with the idea for the film when fielding a question about his own belief in the existence of alien life. 

Armageddon (1998 film)<====>52390<====>Armageddon (1998 film)   Armageddon is a 1998 American science fiction disaster film directed by Michael Bay, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and released by Touchstone Pictures.

Xanthine<====>52432<====>Xanthine Xanthine (  or  ; archaically xanthic acid) (3,7-dihydropurine-2,6-dione), is a purine base found in most human body tissues and fluids and in other organisms.  A number of stimulants are derived from xanthine, including caffeine and theobromine.    Xanthine is a product on the pathway of purine degradation. It is created from guanine by guanine deaminase. It is created from hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidoreductase. It is also created from xanthosine by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP).  Xanthine is subsequently converted to uric acid by the action of the xanthine oxidase enzyme. Studies reported in 2008, based on  12 C/ 13 C isotopic ratios of organic compounds found in the Murchison meteorite, suggested that xanthine and related chemicals, including the RNA component uracil, were formed extraterrestrially.

Tait's conjecture<====>52435<====>Tait's conjecture In mathematics, Tait's conjecture states that "Every 3-connected planar cubic graph has a Hamiltonian cycle (along the edges) through all its vertices".  It was proposed by   and disproved by  , who constructed a counterexample with 25 faces, 69 edges and 46 vertices.  Several smaller counterexamples, with 21 faces, 57 edges and 38 vertices, were later proved minimal by  . The condition that the graph be 3-regular is necessary due to polyhedra such as the rhombic dodecahedron, which forms a bipartite graph with six degree-four vertices on one side and eight degree-three vertices on the other side; because any Hamiltonian cycle would have to alternate between the two sides of the bipartition, but they have unequal numbers of vertices, the rhombic dodecahedron is not Hamiltonian.

Counter-Earth<====>52459<====>Counter-Earth The Counter-Earth is a hypothetical body of the Solar system hypothesized by the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher Philolaus (c.  470 – c.  385 BC) to support his non-geocentric cosmology, in which all objects in the universe revolve around an unseen "Central Fire" (distinct from the Sun which also revolves around it).  The Greek word Antichthon ( ) means "Counter-Earth". In modern times a hypothetical planet always on the other side of the Sun from Earth has been called a "Counter-Earth",    and has been a recurring theme in UFO claims,  as well as in fiction (particularly science fiction). 

French colonization of the Americas<====>52460<====>French colonization of the AmericasThe French colonization of the Americas began in the 16th century, and continued on into the following centuries as France established a colonial empire in the Western Hemisphere.  France founded colonies in much of eastern North America, on a number of Caribbean islands, and in South America.  Most colonies were developed to export products such as fish, rice sugar, and furs. As they colonized the New World, the French established forts and settlements that would become such cities as Quebec and Montreal in Canada; Detroit, Green Bay, St.  Louis, Cape Girardeau, Mobile, Biloxi, Baton Rouge and New Orleans in the United States; and Port-au-Prince, Cap-Haïtien (founded as Cap-Français) in Haiti, Cayenne in French Guiana and São Luís (founded as Saint-Louis de Maragnan) in Brazil.

History of Greenland<====>52476<====>History of Greenland The history of Greenland is a history of life under extreme Arctic conditions: currently, an ice cap covers about 80 percent of the island, restricting human activity largely to the coasts. The first humans are thought to have arrived in Greenland around 2500 BC.  Their descendants apparently died out and were succeeded by several other groups migrating from continental North America.  There has been no evidence discovered that Greenland was known to Europeans until the 10th century, when Icelandic Vikings settled on its southwestern coast, which seems to have been uninhabited when they arrived.  The ancestors of the Inuit Greenlanders who live there today appear to have migrated there later, around 1200 AD, from northwestern Greenland. 

History of Canada<====>52477<====>History of Canada   The history of Canada covers the period from the arrival of Paleo-Indians thousands of years ago to the present day.  Prior to European colonization, the lands encompassing present-day Canada were inhabited for millennia by Indigenous peoples, with distinct trade networks, spiritual beliefs, and styles of social organization.  Some of these older civilizations had long faded by the time of the first European arrivals and have been discovered through archaeological investigations. Starting in the late 15th century, French and British expeditions explored, colonized, and fought over various places within North America in what constitutes present-day Canada. 

Dutch colonization of the Americas<====>52482<====>Dutch colonization of the Americas The Dutch colonization of the Americas began with the establishment of Dutch trading posts and plantations in the Americas, which preceded the much wider known colonisation activities of the Dutch in Asia.  While the first Dutch fort in Asia was built in 1600 (in present-day Indonesia), the first forts and settlements on the Essequibo River in Guyana date from the 1590s.  Actual colonization, with the Dutch settling in the new lands, was not as common as with other European nations.  Many of the Dutch settlements were lost or abandoned by the end of the 17th century, but the Netherlands managed to retain possession of Suriname until it gained independence in 1975, as well as the Netherlands Antilles, which remain within the Kingdom of the Netherlands today. 

Electronic mailing list<====>52483<====>Electronic mailing list  An electronic mailing list or email list is a special use of email that allows for widespread distribution of information to many Internet users.  It is similar to a traditional mailing list – a list of names and addresses – as might be kept by an organization for sending publications to its members or customers, but typically refers to four things:a list of email addresses,the people ("subscribers") receiving mail at those addresses,the publications (email messages) sent to those addresses, anda reflector, which is a single email address that, when designated as the recipient of a message, will send a copy of that message to all of the subscribers. 

Danish colonization of the Americas<====>52484<====>Danish colonization of the Americas Denmark and the former political union of Denmark–Norway had a colonial empire from the 17th through the 20th centuries, large portions of which were found in the Americas.  Denmark and Norway in one form or another also maintained land claims in Greenland since the 13th century. Greenland   Greenland, which had been settled by the Norsemen in the 980s,  submitted to Norwegian rule in 1261.  Marquardt, Ole.  "Change and Continuity in Denmark's Greenland Policy" in The Oldenburg Monarchy: An Underestimated Empire?.  Verlag Ludwig (Kiel), 2006.   Norway entered the Kalmar Union with Denmark and Sweden in 1397 and its overseas territories including Greenland became subject to the king in Copenhagen. 

History of Suriname<====>52486<====>History of Suriname The early history of Suriname dates from 3000 BCE when Native Americans first inhabited the area.  The Dutch acquired Suriname from the English, and European settlement in any numbers dates from the seventeenth century, when it was a plantation colony utilizing slavery for sugar cultivation.  With abolition in the late nineteenth century, planters sought labor from China, Madeira, India, and Indonesia, which was also colonized by the Dutch.  Although Dutch is Suriname's official language, with such a diverse population, it developed a Creole language, Sranan.  Indigenous settlementSuriname was populated millennia before the Europeans by many distinct indigenous cultures. 

Ivan Pavlov<====>52487<====>Ivan Pavlov   Ivan Petrovich Pavlov ( ;   27 February 1936) was a Russian physiologist known primarily for his work in classical conditioning. From his childhood days Pavlov demonstrated intellectual curiosity along with an unusual energy which he referred to as "the instinct for research".Inspired by the progressive ideas which D.  I.  Pisarev, the most eminent of the Russian literary critics of the 1860s, and I.  M.  Sechenov, the father of Russian physiology, were spreading, Pavlov abandoned his religious career and devoted his life to science.  In 1870 he enrolled in the physics and mathematics department at the University of Saint Petersburg in order to study natural science.

Non-repudiation<====>52491<====>Non-repudiation Non-repudiation refers to a state of affairs where the author of a statement will not be able to successfully challenge the authorship of the statement or validity of an associated contract.   The term is often seen in a legal setting wherein the authenticity of a signature is being challenged.   In such an instance, the authenticity is being "repudiated". In securityIn a general sense non-repudiation involves associating actions or changes to a unique individual.  For a secure area, for example, it may be desirable to implement a key card access system.  Non-repudiation would be violated if it were not also a strictly enforced policy to prohibit sharing of the key cards and to immediately report lost or stolen cards. 

Gor<====>52495<====>Gor  Gor   is the Counter-Earth setting for an extended series of sword and planet novels by author and philosophy professor John Norman.   The series is inspired particularly by the Barsoom series and Almuric, but is also known for its content combining philosophy, erotica and science fantasy.   The series is known for its repeated depiction of sexual fantasies involving men abducting and physically and sexually brutalizing women, who grow to enjoy their submissive state.   According to The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, Norman's "sexual philosophy" is "widely detested",  but the books have inspired a Gorean subculture. 

Nobel Prize in Physics<====>52497<====>Nobel Prize in Physics  The Nobel Prize in Physics ( ) is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who conferred the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physics.  It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The first Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to physicist Wilhelm Röntgen in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the discovery of the remarkable rays (or x-rays). 

Fork<====>52501<====>Fork   A fork, in cutlery or kitchenware, is a tool consisting of a handle with several narrow tines on one end.  The usually metal utensil is used to lift food to the mouth or to hold ingredients in place while they are being cut by a knife.  Food can be lifted either by spearing it on the tines or by holding it on top of the tines, which are often curved slightly. HistoryThe word fork comes from the Latin furca, meaning "pitchfork".  Some of the earliest known uses of forks with food occurred in Ancient Egypt, where large forks were used as cooking utensils. 

Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine<====>52502<====>Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine   The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ( ),  administered by the Nobel Foundation, is awarded once a year for outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine.  It is one of five Nobel Prizes established  in 1895 by  Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, in his will.  Nobel was personally interested in experimental physiology and wanted to establish a prize for progress through scientific discoveries in laboratories.  The Nobel Prize is presented to the recipient(s) at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death, along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award. 

British colonization of the Americas<====>52507<====>British colonization of the Americas    The British colonization of the Americas (including colonization by both the English and the Scots) began in 1607 in Jamestown, Virginia, and reached its peak when colonies had been established throughout the Americas.  The English, and later the British, were among the most important colonizers of the Americas, and their American empire came to rival the Spanish American colonies in military and economic might. Three types of colonies were established in the English overseas possessions in America of the 17th century and continued into the British Empire at the height of its power in the 18th century. 

Gwynedd<====>52508<====>Gwynedd   Gwynedd ( ;  ) is an area in north-west Wales, named after the old Kingdom of Gwynedd.  As a local government area, it is the second biggest in Wales in terms of geographical area and also one of the most sparsely populated.  A majority of the population are Welsh-speaking.  The name Gwynedd is also used for a preserved county, covering the two local government areas of Gwynedd and the Isle of Anglesey.  Culturally and historically, the name can also be used for most of North Wales (for instance, the area covered by the Gwynedd Constabulary), roughly corresponding to the territory of the Kingdom of Gwynedd at its greatest extent. 

Mores<====>52510<====>Mores   Mores (  sometimes  ;  from Latin mōrēs,  , plural form of singular  , meaning "manner", "custom", "usage", "habit") was introduced from English into American English by William Graham Sumner (1840–1910), an early U. S.  sociologist, to refer to social norms that are widely observed and are considered to have greater moral significance than others.  Mores include an aversion for societal taboos, such as incest.The mores of a society usually predicate legislation prohibiting their taboos.  Often, countries will employ specialized vice squads or vice police engaged in suppressing specific crimes offending the societal mores. 

Ulrike Meinhof<====>52517<====>Ulrike Meinhof   Ulrike Marie Meinhof (7 October 1934 – 9 May 1976) was a German far-left militant.  She co-founded the Red Army Faction (Rote Armee Fraktion or RAF) in 1970, after having worked as a journalist for the monthly left-wing magazine konkret.  She was arrested in 1972, charged with numerous murders and the formation of a criminal association.  In 1976, before the trial concluded, Meinhof was found hanged in her prison cell.  The official statement claimed that Meinhof had committed suicide, however several facts led to public controversy about her death. Early lifeUlrike Meinhof was born in 1934 in Oldenburg, Germany. 

Vale of Glamorgan<====>52519<====>Vale of Glamorgan  The Vale of Glamorgan, often referred to as The Vale, (   ) is a county borough in Wales.  With an economy based largely on agriculture and chemicals, it is the southernmost unitary authority in Wales.  Attractions include Barry Island Pleasure Park (known through the BBC sitcom, Gavin & Stacey), the Barry Tourist Railway, Porthkerry Park, St Donat's Castle, Cosmeston Lakes Country Park and Cosmeston Medieval Village.  It is also the location of Atlantic College, one of the United World Colleges. The largest town is Barry.  Other towns include Penarth, Llantwit Major and Cowbridge. 

Glamorgan<====>52520<====>Glamorgan   Glamorgan ( ), or sometimes Glamorganshire, (    or    ) is one of the thirteen historic counties of Wales and a former administrative county of Wales.  It was originally an early medieval petty kingdom of varying boundaries known as Glywysing until taken over by the Normans as a lordship.  Glamorgan is latterly represented by the three preserved counties of Mid Glamorgan, South Glamorgan and West Glamorgan.  The name also survives in that of Vale of Glamorgan, a county borough. Although initially a rural and pastoral area of little value, the area that became known as Glamorgan was a conflict point between the Norman lords and the Welsh princes, with the area being defined by a large concentration of castles. 

Bar and Bat Mitzvah<====>52526<====>Bar and Bat Mitzvah    Bar Mitzvah ( ) and Bat Mitzvah ( ) (Ashkenazi pronunciation: "Bas Mitzvah") (plural: B'nai Mitzvah for boys, and B'not Mitzvah – Ashkenazi pronunciation: "B'nos Mitzvah" – for girls) are Jewish coming of age rituals. According to Jewish law, when Jewish boys become 13 years old, they become accountable for their actions and become a bar mitzvah.  A girl becomes a bat mitzvah at the age of 12 according to Orthodox and Conservative Jews, and at the age of 13 according to Reform Jews.   Prior to reaching bar mitzvah age, the child's parents hold the responsibility for the child's actions. 

7-Dehydrocholesterol<====>52533<====>7-Dehydrocholesterol   7-Dehydrocholesterol is a zoosterol that functions in the serum as a cholesterol precursor, and is converted to vitamin D 3  in the skin, therefore functioning as provitamin-D 3 .  The presence of this compound in human skin enables humans to manufacture vitamin D 3  (cholecalciferol) from ultraviolet rays in the sun light, via an intermediate isomer pre-vitamin D 3 .  It is also found in the milk of several mammalian species.   In insects it is a precursor for the hormone ecdysone, required for reaching adulthood.   It was discovered by Nobel-laureate organic chemist Adolf Windaus. 

Axiom of empty set<====>52534<====>Axiom of empty set In axiomatic set theory, the axiom of empty set is an axiom of Kripke–Platek set theory and the variant of general set theory that Burgess (2005) calls "ST," and a demonstrable truth in Zermelo set theory and Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, with or without the axiom of choice. Formal statementIn the formal language of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms, the axiom reads: \exists x\, \forall y\, \lnot (y \in x) or in words:There is a set such that no element is a member of it. InterpretationWe can use the axiom of extensionality to show that there is only one empty set. 

Nationalist Party (Australia)<====>52536<====>Nationalist Party (Australia)    The Nationalist Party was an Australian political party.  It was formed on 17 February 1917 from a merger between the conservative Commonwealth Liberal Party and the National Labor Party, the latter formed by Prime Minister Billy Hughes and his supporters after the 1916 Labor Party split over World War I conscription.  The Nationalist Party was in government (from 1923 in coalition with the Country Party) until electoral defeat in 1929.  From that time it was the main opposition to the Labor Party until it merged with pro-Joseph Lyons Labor defectors to form the United Australia Party (UAP) in 1931. 

54 BC<====>52537<====>54 BC   Year 54 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Appius and Ahenobarbus (or, less frequently, year 700 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 54 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placeRoman RepublicConsuls: Appius Claudius Pulcher and Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus.

55 BC<====>52538<====>55 BC   Year 55 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Crassus and Pompey (or, less frequently, year 699 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 55 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placeRoman RepublicConsuls: Marcus Licinius Crassus and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus. Consuls Marcus Licinius Crassus and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus pass the Lex Trebonia.

Melanocyte<====>52541<====>Melanocyte Melanocytes (  or    ) are melanin-producing neural-crest derived  cells located in the bottom layer (the stratum basale) of the skin's epidermis, the middle layer of the eye (the uvea),    the inner ear,    meninges,    bones,    and heart.Melanin is the pigment primarily responsible for skin color.  Once synthesised, melanin is contained in a special organelle called a melanosome and moved along arm-like structures called dendrites, so as to reach the keratinocytes. MelanogenesisThrough a process called melanogenesis, melanocytes produce melanin, which is a pigment found in the skin, eyes, and hair. 

Aldo Moro<====>52544<====>Aldo Moro  Aldo Romeo Luigi Moro ( ; 23 September 1916 – 9 May 1978) was an Italian statesman and a prominent member of the Christian Democracy party.  He served as 38th Prime Minister of Italy, from 1963 to 1968, and then from 1974 to 1976.  He was one of Italy's longest-serving post-war Prime Ministers, holding power for a combined total of more than six years; due to his accommodation with the Communist leader Enrico Berlinguer, known as Historic Compromise, Moro is widely considered one of the most prominent fathers of the Italian centre-left and one of the greatest and most popular leaders in the history of the Italian Republic. 

Semiology (Gregorian Chant)<====>52545<====>Semiology (Gregorian Chant)Not to be confused with Music semiology.  Semiology (from Greek σημεῖον sēmeion, "a sign, a mark") is a branch of Gregorian Chant research.  Semiology refers specifically to the study of the neumes as found in the earliest fully notated manuscripts of Gregorian Chant, the oldest of which have been dated to the 9th century.  The first application of the term 'semiology' (which first appeared in the 1960s) for the study of Latin chant was made by Dom Eugène Cardine (1905–1988), a monk of the Abbey of Solesmes.  In this context, 'semiology' is understood as 'the study of musical signs'. 

Genesis (band)<====>52546<====>Genesis (band)Genesis were an English rock band formed at Charterhouse School, Godalming, Surrey in 1967.  The most commercially successful and longest-lasting line-up consisted of keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford and drummer/singer Phil Collins.  Significant former members were guitarist Steve Hackett and original lead singer Peter Gabriel.  The band underwent many changes in musical style over its career, from folk music to progressive rock in the 1970s, before moving towards pop at the end of the decade.  They have sold 21. 5 million RIAA-certified albums in the United States and their worldwide sales are estimated to be between 100 million and 150 million. 

Jehovah's Witnesses<====>52547<====>Jehovah's Witnesses  Jehovah's Witnesses is a millenarian restorationist Christian denomination with nontrinitarian beliefs distinct from mainstream Christianity.  Sources for descriptors:Millenarian:  Restorationist:  Christian:Denomination:The group reports a worldwide membership of more than 8. 3 million adherents involved in evangelism and an annual Memorial attendance of more than 20 million.Jehovah's Witnesses are directed by the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses, a group of elders in Warwick, New York, which establishes all doctrines  based on its interpretations of the Bible.    They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent, and that the establishment of God's kingdom over the earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity. 

Carl Bildt<====>52548<====>Carl Bildt    Nils Daniel Carl Bildt (born 15 July 1949) is a Swedish politician and diplomat who was Prime Minister of Sweden from 1991 to 1994.  He was the leader of the Moderate Party from 1986 to 1999.  Bildt served as Sweden's Minister for Foreign Affairs from October 2006 to October 2014. He had been noted internationally as a mediator in the Yugoslav wars, serving as the European Union's Special Envoy to the Former Yugoslavia from June 1995, co-chairman of the Dayton Peace Conference in November 1995 and High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina from December 1995 to June 1997, immediately after the Bosnian War. 

Star Wars (film)<====>52549<====>Star Wars (film)Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope) is a 1977 American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas.  It is the first film in the original Star Wars trilogy and the beginning of the Star Wars franchise.  Starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing, Alec Guinness, David Prowse, James Earl Jones, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Peter Mayhew, the film's plot focuses on the Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia (Fisher), and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empire's space station, the Death Star. 

Axiom of power set<====>52552<====>Axiom of power setIn mathematics, the axiom of power set is one of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms of axiomatic set theory. In the formal language of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms, the axiom reads: \forall x \, \exists y \, \forall z \, [z \in y \iff \forall w \, (w \in z \Rightarrow w \in x)] where y is the Power set of x,  \mathcal{P}(x) .  In English, this says:Given any set x, there is a set  \mathcal{P}(x)  such that, given any set z, this set z is a member of  \mathcal{P}(x)  if and only if every element of z is also an element of x. 

Axiom of union<====>52553<====>Axiom of unionIn axiomatic set theory, the axiom of union is one of the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, stating that, for any set x there is a set y whose elements are precisely the elements of the elements of x.  It was introduced by  .  Together with the axiom of pairing this implies that for any two sets, there is a set (called their union) that contains exactly the elements of both.  Together with the axiom of replacement the axiom of union implies that one can form the union of a family of sets indexed by a set. 

Defense Information Systems Agency<====>52555<====>Defense Information Systems Agency  The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), known as the Defense Communications Agency (DCA) until 1991, is a United States Department of Defense (DoD) combat support agency composed of military, federal civilians, and contractors.  DISA provides information technology (IT) and communications support to the President, Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the military services, the combatant commands, and any individual or system contributing to the defense of the United States. According to the mission statement on the agency website, DISA “provides, operates, and assures command and control, information sharing capabilities, and a globally accessible enterprise information infrastructure in direct support to joint warfighters, National level leaders, and other mission and coalition partners across the full spectrum of operations. 

United States Department of Justice<====>52563<====>United States Department of Justice The United States Department of Justice (DOJ), also known as the Justice Department, is a federal executive department of the U. S.  government, responsible for the enforcement of the law and administration of justice in the United States, equivalent to the justice or interior ministries of other countries.  The department was formed in 1870 during the Ulysses S.  Grant administration.  In its early years, the DOJ vigorously prosecuted Ku Klux Klan members. The Department of Justice administers several federal law enforcement agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). 

Partial differential equation<====>52564<====>Partial differential equationIn mathematics, a partial differential equation (PDE) is a differential equation that contains unknown multivariable functions and their partial derivatives.  (A special case is ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which deal with functions of a single variable and their derivatives. ) PDEs are used to formulate problems involving functions of several variables, and are either solved by hand, or used to create a relevant computer model. PDEs can be used to describe a wide variety of phenomena such as sound, heat, electrostatics, electrodynamics, fluid dynamics, elasticity, or quantum mechanics.  These seemingly distinct physical phenomena can be formalised similarly in terms of PDEs. 

Partial derivative<====>52565<====>Partial derivativeIn mathematics, a partial derivative of a function of several variables is its derivative with respect to one of those variables, with the others held constant (as opposed to the total derivative, in which all variables are allowed to vary).  Partial derivatives are used in vector calculus and differential geometry. The partial derivative of a function  f(x, y, \dots)  with respect to the variable  x  is variously denoted by f^\prime_x,\ f_x,\ \partial_x f,\ D_xf,\ D_1f,\  \frac{\partial}{\partial x}f, \text{ or }  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}.  Sometimes, if  z=f(x, y, \dots),  the partial derivative of  z  with respect to  x  is denoted as  {\partial z}\over{\partial x}. 

John Goldsmith (linguist)<====>52566<====>John Goldsmith (linguist)   John Anton Goldsmith is the Edward Carson Waller Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago, with appointments in linguistics and computer science.His Ph. D thesis introduced autosegmental phonology, which regards phonological phenomena as a collection of parallel tiers with individual segments representing certain features of speech.  Goldsmith's research ranges from phonology to computational linguistics.  His recent research deals with unsupervised learning of linguistic structure, as well as in extending computational linguistics algorithms to bioinformatics. BiographyHe was educated at Swarthmore College, where he obtained his B. A.  in 1972, and at MIT, where he completed his Ph. 

Autosegmental phonology<====>52567<====>Autosegmental phonology Autosegmental phonology is a framework of phonological analysis proposed by John Goldsmith in his PhD thesis in 1976 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). As a theory of phonological representation, autosegmental phonology developed a formal account of ideas that had been sketched in earlier work by several linguists, notably Bernard Bloch (1948), Charles Hockett (1955) and J.  R.  Firth (1948).  On such a view, phonological representations consist of more than one linear sequence of segments; each linear sequence constitutes a separate tier.  The co-registration of elements (or autosegments) on one tier with those on another is represented by association lines. 

Igbo language<====>52570<====>Igbo language Igbo ( ;  ;  ; Laurie Bauer, 2007, The Linguistics Student's Handbook, Edinburgh ), is the principal native language of the Igbo people, an ethnic group of southeastern Nigeria.  The language has approximately 24 million speakers, who live mostly in Nigeria and are primarily of Igbo descent.  Igbo is written in the Latin script, which was introduced by British colonialists. Igbo has over 20 dialects, though dialect levelling appears to be occurring.   A standard literary language was developed in 1972 based on the Owerri (Isuama) and Umuahia (such as Ohuhu) dialects, though it omits the nasalization and aspiration of those varieties. 

Halogen lamp<====>52571<====>Halogen lampA halogen lamp, also known as a tungsten halogen, quartz-halogen or quartz iodine lamp, is an incandescent lamp consisting of a tungsten filament sealed into a compact transparent envelope that is filled with a mixture of an inert gas and a small amount of a halogen such as iodine or bromine.  The combination of the halogen gas and the tungsten filament produces a halogen cycle chemical reaction which redeposits evaporated tungsten to the filament, increasing its life and maintaining the clarity of the envelope.  Because of this, a halogen lamp can be operated at a higher temperature than a standard gas-filled lamp of similar power and operating life, producing light of a higher luminous efficacy and color temperature. 

The Sound Pattern of English<====>52572<====>The Sound Pattern of English  The Sound Pattern of English (frequently referred to as SPE) is a 1968 work on phonology (a branch of linguistics) by Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle.  It presents a view of the phonology of English, and has been very influential in both the field of phonology and in the analysis of the English language.  Chomsky and Halle present a view of phonology as a linguistic subsystem, separate from other components of the grammar, that transforms an underlying phonemic sequence according to rules and produces as its output the phonetic form that is uttered by a speaker. 

Real line<====>52580<====>Real line  In mathematics, the real line, or real number line is the line whose points are the real numbers.   That is, the real line is the set   of all real numbers, viewed as a geometric space, namely the Euclidean space of dimension one.  It can be thought of as a vector space (or affine space), a metric space, a topological space, a measure space, or a linear continuum. Just like the set of real numbers, the real line is usually denoted by the symbol   (or alternatively,   \mathbb{R}  , the letter “R” in blackboard bold). 

The Smiths<====>52581<====>The Smiths   The Smiths were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1982.  The band consisted of vocalist Morrissey, guitarist Johnny Marr, bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce.  Critics have called them one of the most important bands to emerge from the British independent music scene of the 1980s.  Q magazine's Simon Goddard argued in 2007 that the Smiths were "the one truly vital voice of the '80s", "the most influential British guitar group of the decade" and the "first indie outsiders to achieve mainstream success on their own terms".   The NME named the Smiths the "most influential artist ever" in a 2002 poll, over the Beatles.

While the Byzantine fleet is engaged against the Arabs in the Mediterranean, the Rus' forces reach the gates of Constantinople.  Emperor Romanos I organizes the defense of the capital and assembles 15 old ships (equipped with throwers of Greek fire) under the chamberlain (protovestiarios) Theophanes. 

Thespis<====>52585<====>Thespis Thespis ( ;  ; fl.  6th century BC) of Icaria (present-day Dionysos, Greece), according to certain Ancient Greek sources and especially Aristotle, was the first person ever to appear on stage as an actor playing a character in a play (instead of speaking as him or herself).   In other sources, he is said to have introduced the first principal actor in addition to the chorus.  Thespis was a singer of dithyrambs (songs about stories from mythology with choric refrains).  He is credited with introducing a new style in which one singer or actor performed the words of individual characters in the stories, distinguishing between the characters with the aid of different masks.

The Population Bomb<====>52590<====>The Population Bomb The Population Bomb is a best-selling book written by Stanford University Professor Paul R.  Ehrlich and his wife, Anne Ehrlich (who was uncredited), in 1968. It warned of mass starvation of humans in the 1970s and 1980s due to overpopulation, as well as other major societal upheavals, and advocated immediate action to limit population growth.  Fears of a "population explosion" were widespread in the 1950s and 1960s, but the book and its author brought the idea to an even wider audience.

Monoculture<====>52599<====>Monoculture Monoculture is the agricultural practice of producing or growing a single crop, plant, or livestock species, variety, or breed in a field or farming system at a time.  Polyculture, where more than one crop is grown in the same space at the same time, is the alternative to monoculture.   Monoculture is widely used in both industrial farming and organic farming and has allowed increased efficiency in planting and harvest. Continuous monoculture, or monocropping, where the same species is grown year after year,  can lead to the quicker buildup of pests and diseases, and then rapid spread where a uniform crop is susceptible to a pathogen.

More specifically, tobacco refers to any of various plants of the genus Nicotiana (especially N. 

Baking<====>52634<====>BakingBaking is a method of cooking food that uses prolonged dry heat, normally in an oven, but also in hot ashes, or on hot stones.  The most common baked item is bread but many other types of foods are baked.   Heat is gradually transferred "from the surface of cakes, cookies, and breads to their centre.  As heat travels through, it transforms batters and doughs into baked goods with a firm dry crust and a softer centre".   p. 38   Baking can be combined with grilling to produce a hybrid barbecue variant by using both methods simultaneously, or one after the other. 

Boiling<====>52636<====>BoilingBoiling is the rapid vaporization of a liquid, which occurs when a liquid is heated to its boiling point, the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding atmosphere.  The higher the pressure the higher the boiling point.  There are two main types of boiling; nucleate boiling where small bubbles of vapour form at discrete points, and critical heat flux boiling where the boiling surface is heated above a certain critical temperature and a film of vapor forms on the surface.  Transition boiling is an intermediate, unstable form of boiling with elements of both types.

Van de Graaff generator<====>52642<====>Van de Graaff generator  A Van de Graaff generator is an electrostatic generator which uses a moving belt to accumulate electric charge on a hollow metal globe on the top of an insulated column, creating very high electric potentials.  It produces very high voltage direct current (DC) electricity at low current levels.  It was invented by American physicist Robert J.  Van de Graaff in 1929.The potential difference achieved by modern Van de Graaff generators can be as much as 5 megavolts.  A tabletop version can produce on the order of 100,000 volts and can store enough energy to produce a visible spark. 

Cysteine<====>52644<====>Cysteine   Cysteine (abbreviated as Cys or C)  is a semi-essential    proteinogenic amino acid with the formula HO 2 CCH(NH 2 )CH 2 SH.  It is encoded by the codons UGU and UGC.  The thiol side chain in cysteine often participates in enzymatic reactions, as a nucleophile.   The thiol is susceptible to oxidization to give the disulfide derivative cystine, which serves an important structural role in many proteins.  When used as a food additive, it has the E number E920. Cysteine has the same structure as serine, but with one of its oxygen atoms replaced by sulfur; replacing it with selenium gives selenocysteine. 

Camera<====>52648<====>Camera   A camera is an  optical instrument for recording or capturing images, which may be stored locally, transmitted to another location, or both.  The images may be individual still photographs or sequences of images constituting videos or movies.  The camera is a remote sensing device as it senses subjects without any contact .  The word camera comes from camera obscura, which means "dark chamber" and is the Latin name of the original device for projecting an image of external reality onto a flat surface.  The modern photographic camera evolved from the camera obscura. 

Acetylcholine<====>52649<====>Acetylcholine Acetylcholine (ACh) is an organic chemical that functions in the brain and body of many types of animals, including humans, as a neurotransmitter—a chemical released by nerve cells to send signals to other cells.Its name is derived from its chemical structure: it is an ester of acetic acid and choline.  Parts in the body that use or are affected by acetylcholine are referred to as cholinergic.  Substances that interfere with acetylcholine activity are called anticholinergics. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used at the neuromuscular junction—in other words, it is the chemical that motor neurons of the nervous system release in order to activate muscles. 

Squash (sport)<====>52653<====>Squash (sport) Squash is a ball sport played by two (singles) or four players (doubles) in a four-walled court with a small, hollow rubber ball.  The players must alternate in striking the ball with their racket and hit the ball onto the playable surfaces of the four walls of the court. The game was formerly called squash rackets, a reference to the "squashable" soft ball used in the game (compared with the harder ball used in its sister game rackets). The governing body of Squash, the World Squash Federation (WSF) is recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), but the sport is not part of the Olympic Games, despite a number of applications.

Racket (sports equipment)<====>52664<====>Racket (sports equipment) A racket or racquet  is a sports implement consisting of a handled frame with an open hoop across which a network of strings or catgut is stretched tightly.  It is used for striking a ball or shuttlecock in games such as squash, tennis, racquetball, and badminton.  Collectively, these games are known as racket sports.  This predecessor to the modern game of squash, rackets, is played with   wooden rackets.  While squash equipment has evolved in the intervening century, rackets equipment has changed little. The frame of rackets for all sports was traditionally made of laminated wood and the strings of animal intestine known as catgut.

Deejay (Jamaican)<====>52672<====>Deejay (Jamaican)   In  Jamaican music, a deejay (DJ) is a reggae or dancehall musician who sings and "toasts" to an instrumental riddim. Deejays are not to be confused with DJs from other music genres like hip-hop, where they select and play music.  Dancehall/reggae DJs who select riddims to play are called selectors.  Deejays whose style is nearer to singing are sometimes called singjays. The term deejay came about as a result of the act of some selectors of the 1960s and 1970s such as U-Roy or King Stitt toasting to the version side of popular records of the time. 

Strouhal number<====>52675<====>Strouhal numberIn dimensional analysis, the Strouhal number (St) is a dimensionless number describing oscillating flow mechanisms.  The parameter is named after Vincenc Strouhal, a Czech physicist who experimented in 1878 with wires experiencing vortex shedding and singing in the wind.    The Strouhal number is an integral part of the fundamentals of fluid mechanics. The Strouhal number is often given as;  \mathrm{St}= {f L\over U},  where f is the frequency of vortex shedding, L is the characteristic length (for example hydraulic diameter, or the airfoil thickness) and U is the flow velocity.  In certain cases like heaving (plunging) flight, this characteristic length is the amplitude of oscillation. 

Greek literature<====>52682<====>Greek literature Greek literature dates from ancient Greek literature, beginning in 800 BC, to the modern Greek literature of today.  Ancient Greek literature was written in an Ancient Greek dialect.  This literature ranges from the oldest surviving written works until works from approximately the fifth century AD.  This time period is divided into the Preclassical, Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman periods.  Preclassical Greek literature primarily revolved around myths and include the works of Homer; the Iliad and the Odyssey.  The Classical period saw the dawn of drama and history. Three philosophers are especially notable: Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. 

Ancient Greek architecture<====>52684<====>Ancient Greek architectureThe architecture of ancient Greece is the architecture produced by the Greek-speaking people (Hellenic people) whose culture flourished on the Greek mainland, the Peloponnese, the Aegean Islands, and in colonies in Anatolia and Italy for a period from about 900 BC until the 1st century AD, with the earliest remaining architectural works dating from around 600 BC.  Ancient Greek architecture is best known from its temples, many of which are found throughout the region, mostly as ruins but many substantially intact.  The second important type of building that survives all over the Hellenic world is the open-air theatre, with the earliest dating from around 525-480 BC. 

Ancient Roman architecture<====>52685<====>Ancient Roman architecture Ancient Roman architecture adopted the external language of classical Greek architecture for the purposes of the ancient Romans, but differed from Greek buildings, becoming a new architectural style.  The two styles are often considered one body of classical architecture.   Roman architecture flourished in the Roman Republic and even more so under the Empire, when the great majority of surviving buildings were constructed.  It used new materials, particularly concrete, and newer technologies such as the arch and the dome to make buildings that were typically strong and well-engineered.   Large numbers remain in some form across the empire, sometimes complete and still in use. 

Romanesque architecture<====>52686<====>Romanesque architectureRomanesque architecture is an architectural style of medieval Europe characterized by semi-circular arches.  There is no consensus for the beginning date of the Romanesque style, with proposals ranging from the 6th to the 11th century, this later date being the most commonly held.  It developed in the 12th century into the Gothic style, marked by pointed arches.  Examples of Romanesque architecture can be found across the continent, making it the first pan-European architectural style since Imperial Roman architecture.  The Romanesque style in England is traditionally referred to as Norman architecture. Combining features of ancient Roman and Byzantine buildings and other local traditions, Romanesque architecture is known by its massive quality, thick walls, round arches, sturdy pillars, barrel vaults, large towers and decorative arcading. 

Classical architecture<====>52687<====>Classical architectureClassical architecture usually denotes architecture which is more or less consciously derived from the principles of Greek and Roman architecture of classical antiquity, or sometimes even more specifically, from the works of Vitruvius.

Although classical styles of architecture can vary greatly, they can in general all be said to draw on a common "vocabulary" of decorative and constructive elements. In much of the Western world, different classical architectural styles have dominated the history of architecture from the Renaissance until the second world war, though it continues to inform many architects to this day.

Filet crochet<====>52699<====>Filet crochetFilet crochet is a type of crocheted fabric.  This type of crocheted lace is gridlike because it uses only two crochet stitches: the chain stitch and the double crochet stitch (U. S.  terminology; known in some other countries as chain stitch and treble).  Old filet patterns used a treble or triple stitch vertically but chained two between the vertical stitches.   This was to prevent distortion of some patterns.  Chain stitches use less yarn than double crochet stitches, which results in a visual difference in appearance between the two kinds of stitch.   Filet crochet forms patterns by filling in parts of a mostly chain stitch mesh with double crochet stitches. 

Tunisian crochet<====>52701<====>Tunisian crochetTunisian crochet, also known as Afghan crochet, is a type of crochet that uses an elongated hook, often with a stopper on the handle end, called an Afghan hook.

The work is begun with the traditional starting chain, a series of slip stitches.   Once the chain is completed, the first row is worked by inserting the hook back into the previous link of the chain, and a loop from the free end of the yarn is grabbed with the hook and pulled back through the link.
