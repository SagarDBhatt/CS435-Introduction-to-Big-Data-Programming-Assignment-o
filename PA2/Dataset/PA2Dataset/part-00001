Common Gateway Interface<====>7220<====>Common Gateway Interface In computing, Common Gateway Interface (CGI) offers a standard protocol for web servers to execute programs that execute like Console applications (also called Command-line interface programs) running on a server that generates web pages dynamically. Such programs are known as CGI scripts or simply as CGIs.  The specifics of how the script is executed by the server are determined by the server.   In the common case, a CGI script executes at the time a request is made and generates HTML.    In brief, the CGI program receives HTTP forms data via Unix/Linux standard input, and most other data (such as URL paths, URL arguments, and HTTP header data) via well-known Unix/Linux process environment variables. 

Choctaw<====>7222<====>Choctaw  The Choctaw (In the Choctaw language, Chahta) Common misspellings and variations in other languages include Chacta,  Tchakta  and Chocktaw .   are a Native American people originally occupying what is now the Southeastern United States (modern-day Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, and Louisiana).  Their Choctaw language belongs to the Muskogean language family group. The Choctaw are descendants of the peoples of the Hopewell and Mississippian cultures, who lived throughout the east of the Mississippi River valley and its tributaries.  About 1,700 years ago, the Hopewell people built Nanih Waiya, a great earthwork mound located in what is central present-day Mississippi. 

Chemical affinity<====>7225<====>Chemical affinityIn chemical physics and physical chemistry, chemical affinity is the electronic property by which dissimilar chemical species are capable of forming chemical compounds.    Chemical affinity can also refer to the tendency of an atom or compound to combine by chemical reaction with atoms or compounds of unlike composition. HistoryEarly theoriesThe idea of affinity is extremely old.   Many attempts have been made at identifying its origins.    The majority of such attempts, however, except in a general manner, end in futility since "affinities" lie at the basis of all magic, thereby pre-dating science. 

Comet Hale–Bopp<====>7227<====>Comet Hale–Bopp  Comet Hale–Bopp (formally designated C/1995 O1) is a comet that was perhaps the most widely observed of the 20th century, and one of the brightest seen for many decades. Hale–Bopp was discovered on July 23, 1995 separately by Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp prior to it becoming naked-eye visible on Earth.  Although predicting the maximum apparent brightness of new comets with any degree of certainty is difficult, Hale–Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997.  It was visible to the naked eye for a record 18 months, twice as long as the previous record holder, the Great Comet of 1811. 

Conspiracy<====>7230<====>Conspiracy  A conspiracy is a secret agreement by people to commit something wrong or illegal.  Depending on the circumstances, a conspiracy may be a crime, or a civil wrong. A "conspiracy theory" is an explanation of an event or situation that invokes an unwarranted conspiracy. Types of conspiraciesConspiracy (civil), an agreement between people to deceive, mislead, or defraud others of their legal rights or to gain an unfair advantageConspiracy (criminal), an agreement between people to break the law in the future, in some cases having committed an act to further that agreementConspiracy (political), an agreement between people with the goal of gaining political power or meeting a political objectiveHub-and-spoke conspiracy, a conspiracy in which one or more principal conspirators (the "hub") enter into several similar agreements with others (the "spokes") who know concerted action is contemplated, usually where the success of the concerted action depends on the participation of the other spokesSee alsoConspiracy theoryReferences External links    

Cholistan Desert<====>7232<====>Cholistan Desert  The Cholistan Desert ( ; Punjabi:  ), also locally known as Rohi ( ), sprawls   from Bahawalpur, Punjab, Pakistan and covers an area of  .  It adjoins the Thar Desert, extending over to Sindh and into India. The word Cholistan is derived from the Turkic word chol,  meaning desert.  The people of Cholistan lead a semi-nomadic life, moving from one place to another in search of water and fodder for their animals.  The dry bed of the Hakra River runs through the area, along which many settlements of the Indus Valley Civilization have been found. 

Causantín mac Cináeda<====>7233<====>Causantín mac Cináeda   or   (in Modern Gaelic:  ; died 877) was a king of the Picts.  He is often known as Constantine I in reference to his place in modern lists of kings of Scots, but contemporary sources described   only as a Pictish king.  A son of   ("Kenneth MacAlpin"), he succeeded his uncle   as Pictish king following the latter's death on 13 April 862.  It is likely that  's (Constantine I) reign witnessed increased activity by Vikings, based in Ireland, Northumbria and northern Britain.  He died fighting one such invasion. 

Constantine II (emperor)<====>7234<====>Constantine II (emperor) Constantine II ( ; Jones, pg.  223  January/February 316 – 340) was Roman Emperor from 337 to 340.  Son of Constantine the Great and co-emperor alongside his brothers, his attempt to exert his perceived rights of primogeniture led to his death in a failed invasion of Italy in 340. CareerThe eldest son of Constantine the Great and Fausta, after the death of his half-brother Crispus, Constantine II was born in Arles in February 316  and raised as a Christian.  On 1 March 317, he was made Caesar.   In 323, at the age of seven, he took part in his father's campaign against the Sarmatians. 

Constantine II of Scotland<====>7235<====>Constantine II of Scotland   Constantine, son of Áed (Medieval Gaelic: Constantín mac Áeda; Modern Gaelic: Còiseam mac Aoidh, known in most modern regnal lists as Constantine II; died 952) was an early King of Scotland, known then by the Gaelic name Alba.  The Kingdom of Alba, a name which first appears in Constantine's lifetime, was situated in modern day Scotland.  The core of the kingdom was formed by the lands around the River Tay.  Its southern limit was the River Forth, northwards it extended towards the Moray Firth and perhaps to Caithness, while its western limits are uncertain.

An inbound call centre is operated by a company to administer incoming product support or information enquiries from consumers.  Outbound call centres are operated for telemarketing, solicitation of charitable or political donations, debt collection and market research.  A contact centre is a location for centralised handling of individual communications, including letters, faxes, live support software, social media, instant message, and e-mail.    A call centre has an open workspace for call centre agents, with work stations that include a computer for each agent, a telephone set/headset connected to a telecom switch, and one or more supervisor stations. 

Charles Messier<====>7246<====>Charles Messier  Charles Messier ( ; 26 June 1730 – 12 April 1817) was a French astronomer most notable for publishing an astronomical catalogue consisting of nebulae and star clusters that came to be known as the 110 "Messier objects".  The purpose of the catalogue was to help astronomical observers, in particular comet hunters such as himself, distinguish between permanent and transient visually diffuse objects in the sky. BiographyMessier was born in Badonviller in the Lorraine region of France, being the tenth of twelve children of Françoise B.  Grandblaise and Nicolas Messier, a Court usher.  Six of his brothers and sisters died while young and in 1741, his father died. 

Cemetery H culture<====>7247<====>Cemetery H culture  The Cemetery H culture was a Bronze Age culture in the Punjab region of what is now Pakistan and north-western India, from about 1900 BCE until about 1300 BCE.  It was a regional form of the late phase of the Harappan (Indus Valley) civilisation (alongside the Jhukar culture of Sindh and Rangpur culture of Gujarat), and it has also been connected with the early stages of the Indo-Aryan migrations. OriginsThe Cemetery H culture was located in and around the Punjab region in present-day India and Pakistan.  It was named after a cemetery found in "area H" at Harappa.

Crankshaft<====>7249<====>Crankshaft A crankshaft—related to crank—is a mechanical part able to perform a conversion between reciprocating motion and rotational motion.  In a reciprocating engine, it translates reciprocating motion of the piston into rotational motion; whereas in a reciprocating compressor, it converts the rotational motion into reciprocating motion.  In order to do the conversion between two motions, the crankshaft has "crank throws" or "crankpins", additional bearing surfaces whose axis is offset from that of the crank, to which the "big ends" of the connecting rods from each cylinder attach. It is typically connected to a flywheel to reduce the pulsation characteristic of the four-stroke cycle, and sometimes a torsional or vibrational damper at the opposite end, to reduce the torsional vibrations often caused along the length of the crankshaft by the cylinders farthest from the output end acting on the torsional elasticity of the metal. 

Central nervous system<====>7251<====>Central nervous system The central nervous system (CNS) is the part of the nervous system consisting of the brain and spinal cord.  The central nervous system is so named because it integrates information it receives from, and coordinates and influences the activity of, all parts of the bodies of bilaterally symmetric animals—that is, all multicellular animals except sponges and radially symmetric animals such as jellyfish—and it contains the majority of the nervous system.  Many consider the retina    and the optic nerve (2nd cranial nerve),    as well as the olfactory nerves (1st) and olfactory epithelium    as parts of the CNS, synapsing directly on brain tissue without intermediate ganglia. 

Cell cycle<====>7252<====>Cell cycle  The cell cycle or cell-division cycle is  the series of events that take place in a cell leading to its division and duplication of its DNA (DNA replication) to produce two daughter cells.  In bacteria, which lack a cell nucleus, the cell cycle is divided into the B, C, and D periods.  The B period extends from the end of cell division to the beginning of DNA replication.   DNA replication occurs during the C period.   The D period refers to the stage between the end of DNA replication and the splitting of the bacterial cell into two daughter cells. 

Connection (dance)<====>7255<====>Connection (dance) In partner dancing, connection is a physical communication method used by a pair of dancers to facilitate synchronized dance movement, in which one dancer (the "lead") directs the movements of the other dancer (the "follower") by means of non-verbal directions conveyed through a physical connection between the dancers.  It is an essential technique in many types of partner dancing and is used extensively in partner dances that feature significant physical contact between the dancers, including the Argentine Tango, Lindy Hop, Balboa, East Coast Swing, West Coast Swing, Salsa, and Modern Jive. Other forms of communication, such as visual cues or spoken cues, sometimes aid in connecting with one's partner, but are often used in specific circumstances (e. 

Caste<====>7257<====>Caste   Caste is a form of social stratification characterized by endogamy, hereditary transmission of a lifestyle which often includes an occupation, status in a hierarchy, and customary social interaction and exclusion.    Although caste systems exist in various regions, its paradigmatic ethnographic example is the division of Indian society into rigid social groups, with roots in India's ancient history and persisting until today.   However, the economic significance of the caste system in India has been declining as a result of urbanization and affirmative action programs.   A subject of much scholarship by sociologists and anthropologists, the Indian caste system is sometimes used as an analogical basis for the study of caste-like social divisions existing outside India. 

Coral 66<====>7262<====>Coral 66 CORAL (Computer On-line Real-time Applications Language) is a programming language originally developed in 1964 at the Royal Radar Establishment (RRE), Malvern, UK, as a subset of JOVIAL.   Coral 66 was subsequently developed by I.  F.  Currie and M.  Griffiths under the auspices of IECCA (Inter-Establishment Committee forComputer Applications).  Its official definition,   edited by Woodward, Wetherall and Gorman, was first published in 1970. OverviewCoral 66 is a general-purpose programming language based on ALGOL 60, with some features from Coral 64, JOVIAL, and FORTRAN.  It includes structured record types (as in Pascal) and supports the packing of data into limited storage (also as in Pascal). 

Rhyming slang<====>7264<====>Rhyming slang  Rhyming slang is a form of slang word construction in the English language that uses rhyme.  It is especially prevalent in the UK, Ireland and Australia.  It started in the early 19th century in the East End of London; hence its alternative name, Cockney rhyming slang.  In the United States, especially the criminal underworld of the West Coast between 1880 and 1920, rhyming slang has sometimes been known as Australian slang.The construction of rhyming slang involves replacing a common word with a phrase of two or more words, the last of which rhymes with the original word; then, in almost all cases, omitting, from the end of the phrase, the secondary rhyming word (which is thereafter implied),Bryson, a humourist, states that there is a special name given to this omission: "the word that rhymes is almost always dropped. 

Canchim<====>7265<====>CanchimThe Canchim breed is a breed of beef cattle developed in Central Brazil by crossing European Charolais cattle with Indubrazil cattle already kept in Brazil where Asian Zebu type cattle are best suited to the tropical conditions.  When compared with Zebu bulls, Canchim bulls produce the same number of calves, but heavier and of superior quality.  Compared to European breeds, the Canchim bull produces calves with the same weight but in larger numbers.  The fast-growing progeny, from crossbred zebu cows with Canchim bulls, can be slaughtered at 18 months old from feedlots after weaning, up to 24 months old from feedlots after grazing and at 30 months from grazing on the range. 

Communist Party of the Soviet Union<====>7271<====>Communist Party of the Soviet Union   The Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( ), abbreviated in English as CPSU (  , which was the founding and ruling political party of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR or Soviet Union).  The CPSU was the sole governing party of the Soviet Union until 1990, when the Congress of People's Deputies modified the article of the constitution which had granted the CPSU a monopoly over the political system.  The party was founded in 1912 by the Bolsheviks (a faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, RSDLP), a revolutionary group led by Vladimir Lenin which seized power in the aftermath of the October Revolution of 1917. 

Christianity and homosexuality<====>7272<====>Christianity and homosexuality  Within Christianity, there are a variety of views on the issues of sexual orientation and homosexuality.  The many Christian denominations vary in their position, from condemning homosexual acts as sinful, through being divided on the issue, to seeing it as morally acceptable.  Even within a denomination, individuals and groups may hold different views.  Further, not all members of a denomination necessarily support their church's views on homosexuality. Historically, from the earliest days, Christians have taught that same-sex acts are contrary to Biblical teaching: Tertullian (155 – c.  240),  Cyprian (c.  200 – 258),  Ambrosiaster (300s),  John Chrysostom (c. 

Chadic languages<====>7273<====>Chadic languages The Chadic languages are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family that is spoken in parts of the Sahel.  They include 150 languages spoken across northern Nigeria, southern Niger, southern Chad, Central African Republic and northern Cameroon.  The most widely spoken Chadic language is Hausa, a lingua franca of much of inland Eastern West Africa. CompositionNewman (1977) classified the languages into the four groups which have been accepted in all subsequent literature.  Further subbranching, however, has not been as robust; Blench (2006), for example, only accepts the A/B bifurcation of East Chadic.  West Chadic. 

Cushitic languages<====>7274<====>Cushitic languages The Cushitic languages are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family.  They are spoken primarily in the Horn of Africa (Somalia, Eritrea, Djibouti, and Ethiopia), as well as the Nile Valley (Sudan and Egypt), and parts of the African Great Lakes region (Tanzania and Kenya). The Cushitic languages with the greatest number of total speakers are Oromo (>25 million),  Somali (16. 5 million),  Beja (3. 2 million),  Sidamo (3 million),  and Afar (2 million).   Oromo is the working language of the Oromia Region in Ethiopia.Somali is one of two official languages of Somalia, and as such is the only Cushitic language accorded official language status at the country level. 

Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code<====>7279<====>Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code    Chapter 11 is a chapter of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, which permits reorganization under the bankruptcy laws of the United States.  Chapter 11 bankruptcy is available to every business, whether organized as a corporation, partnership or sole proprietorship, and to individuals, although it is most prominently used by corporate entities.   In contrast, Chapter 7 governs the process of a liquidation bankruptcy (although liquidation can go under this chapter), while Chapter 13 provides a reorganization process for the majority of private individuals. Chapter 11 in generalWhen a business is unable to service its debt or pay its creditors, the business or its creditors can file with a federal bankruptcy court for protection under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 11. 

Controversy<====>7283<====>Controversy  Controversy is a state of prolonged public dispute or debate, usually concerning a matter of conflicting opinion or point of view.  The word was coined from the Latin controversia, as a composite of controversus – "turned in an opposite direction," from contra – "against" – and vertere – to turn, or versus (see  ), hence, "to turn against. "The most applicable or well known controversial subjects, topics or areas are politics, religion, philosophy, parenting and sex.History is similarly controversial.  Other prominent areas of controversy are economics, science, finances, culture, education, the military, society, celebrities, organisation, the media, age, gender, and race. 

Centromere<====>7284<====>Centromere The centromere is the part of a chromosome that links a pair of sister chromatids (a dyad).  During mitosis, spindle fibers attach to the centromere via the kinetochore. Centromeres were first thought to be genetic loci that direct the behavior of chromosomes. The physical role of the centromere is to act as the site of assembly of the kinetochores – a highly complex multiprotein structure that is responsible for the actual events of chromosome segregation – i. e.  binding microtubules and signalling to the cell cycle machinery when all chromosomes have adopted correct attachments to the spindle, so that it is safe for cell division to proceed to completion and for cells to enter anaphase.

Cartography<====>7294<====>Cartography  Cartography (from Greek χάρτης khartēs, "papyrus, sheet of paper, map"; and γράφειν graphein, "write") is the study and practice of making maps.  Combining science, aesthetics, and technique, cartography builds on the premise that reality can be modeled in ways that communicate spatial information effectively. The fundamental problems of traditional cartography are to:Set the map's agenda and select traits of the object to be mapped.  This is the concern of map editing.  Traits may be physical, such as roads or land masses, or may be abstract, such as toponyms or political boundaries. Represent the terrain of the mapped object on flat media. 

Cardiac glycoside<====>7296<====>Cardiac glycoside Cardiac glycosides are a class of organic compounds that increase the output force of the heart and decrease its rate of contractions by acting on the cellular sodium-potassium ATPase pump.Their beneficial medical uses are as treatments for congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias; however, their relative toxicity prevents them from being widely used.   Most commonly found as secondary metabolites in several plants such as foxglove plants, these compounds nevertheless have a diverse range of biochemical effects regarding cardiac cell function and have also been suggested for use in cancer treatment.  ClassificationGeneral StructureThe general structure of a cardiac glycoside consists of a steroid glycoside molecule attached to a sugar and an R group. 

Colonialism<====>7299<====>Colonialism Colonialism is the policy of a nation seeking to extend or retain its authority over other people or territories, generally with the aim of developing or exploiting them to the benefit of the colonizing country and helping the colonies modernize in terms defined by the colonizers, especially in economics, religion and health. The European colonial period was the era from the 15th century to 1914 when Spain, Portugal, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Germany and several  smaller European countries  established colonies outside Europe.  The system practically ended 1945-1975 when nearly all colonies became independent.  At first, the countries followed a policy of mercantilism, designed to strengthen the home economy at the expense of rivals, so the colonies were usually allowed to trade only with the mother country. 

Casablanca<====>7301<====>Casablanca  Casablanca ( ;  ; local informal name: Kaẓa), located in the central-western part of Morocco bordering the Atlantic Ocean, is the largest city in Morocco.  It is also the largest city in the Maghreb, as well as one of the largest and most important cities in Africa, both economically and demographically. Casablanca is Morocco's chief port and one of the largest financial centers on the continent.  According to the 2014 population estimate, the city has a population of about 3. 35 million in the urban area and over 6. 8 million in the Casablanca-Settat region. 

Cross<====>7303<====>Cross   A cross is a geometrical figure consisting of two intersecting lines or bars, usually perpendicular to each other.  The lines usually run vertically and horizontally.  A cross of oblique lines, in the shape of the Latin letter X, is also termed a saltire in heraldic terminology. NameThe word cross is recorded in 10th-century Old English as cros, exclusively for the instrument of Christ's crucifixion, replacing the native Old English word rood.  The word's history is complicated; it appears to have entered English from Old Irish, possibly via Old Norse, ultimately from the Latin crux (or its accusative crucem and its genitive crucis), "stake, cross". 

Coordination complex<====>7304<====>Coordination complex In chemistry, a coordination complex consists of a central atom or ion, which is usually metallic and is called the coordination centre, and a surrounding array of bound molecules or ions, that are in turn known as ligands or complexing agents.  Introduction to Coordination Chemistry by Geoffrey A.  Lawrance 20092010 John Wiley & Sons.   .  Online  .   Many metal-containing compounds, especially those of transition metals, are coordination complexes.   A coordination complex whose centre is a metal atom is called a metal complex. Nomenclature and terminology Coordination complexes are so pervasive that their structures and reactions are described in many ways, sometimes confusingly. 

Coleco<====>7305<====>Coleco Coleco Industries, Inc.  was an American company founded in 1932 by Maurice Greenberg as The Connecticut Leather Company.    It became a highly successful toy company in the 1980s, known for its mass-produced version of Cabbage Patch Kids dolls and its video game consoles, the Coleco Telstar dedicated consoles and ColecoVision.While the company disappeared in 1988 as a result of bankruptcy, the Coleco brand was revived in 2005, and remains active to this day. CompanyColeco Industries, Inc.  started life in 1932 as The Connecticut Leather Company.  Initially the business supplied leather and "shoe findings" to shoe repairers. 

ColecoVision<====>7306<====>ColecoVision  The ColecoVision is Coleco Industries' second-generation home video-game console which was released in August 1982.   The ColecoVision offered a closer experience to more powerful arcade game systems compared to competitors such as the Atari 2600, along with the means to expand the system's basic hardware. The initial catalog of twelve games included Nintendo's Donkey Kong as the pack-in cartridge, Sega's graphically impressive Zaxxon, and some lesser known arcade titles that found a larger audience on the console, such as Lady Bug, Cosmic Avenger, and Venture.  Approximately 145 titles in total were published as ROM cartridges for the system between 1982 and 1984.

Conventional warfare<====>7310<====>Conventional warfare  Conventional warfare is a form of warfare conducted by using conventional weapons and battlefield tactics between two or more states in open confrontation.  The forces on each side are well-defined, and fight using weapons that primarily target the opponent's military.  It is normally fought using conventional weapons, and not with chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons. The general purpose of conventional warfare is to weaken or destroy the opponent's military, thereby negating its ability to engage in conventional warfare.  In forcing capitulation, however, one or both sides may eventually resort to unconventional warfare tactics. Formation of the state The state was first advocated by Plato, then found more acceptance in the consolidation of power under the Roman Catholic Church. 

Chauvinism<====>7312<====>Chauvinism   Chauvinism is a form of extreme patriotism and a  belief in national superiority and glory.  Whereas patriotism and nationalism may represent temperate pride, chauvinism is .  It can be also defined as "an irrational belief in the superiority or dominance of one's own group or people".Moreover, the chauvinist's own people are seen as unique and special while the rest of the people are considered weak or inferior.  According to legend, French soldier Nicolas Chauvin was badly wounded in the Napoleonic wars.  He received a pension for his injuries but it was not enough to live on. 

Hypothetical types of biochemistry<====>7316<====>Hypothetical types of biochemistryHypothetical types of biochemistry are forms of biochemistry speculated to be scientifically viable but not proven to exist at this time.The kinds of living organisms currently known on Earth all use carbon compounds for basic structural and metabolic functions, water as a solvent, and DNA or RNA to define and control their form.  If life exists on other planets or moons, it may be chemically similar; it is also possible that there are organisms with quite different chemistries   —for instance involving other classes of carbon compounds, compounds of another element, or another solvent in place of water. 

Creation myth<====>7322<====>Creation mythA creation myth (or cosmogonic myth) is a symbolic narrative of how the world began and how people first came to inhabit it. , "Creation myths are symbolic stories describing how the universe and its inhabitants came to be.  Creation myths develop through oral traditions and therefore typically have multiple versions. "   While in popular usage the term myth often refers to false or fanciful stories, members of cultures often ascribe varying degrees of truth to their creation myths.  "In common usage the word 'myth' refers to narratives or beliefs that are untrue or merely fanciful; the stories that make up national or ethnic mythologies describe characters and events that common sense and experience tell us are impossible. 

Crucifix<====>7324<====>Crucifix  A crucifix (from Latin cruci fixus meaning "(one) fixed to a cross") is an image of Jesus on the cross, as distinct from a bare cross.  The representation of Jesus himself on the cross is referred to in English as the corpus (Latin for "body").   The crucifix is a principal symbol for many groups of Christians, and one of the most common forms of the Crucifixion in the arts.  It is especially important in the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church, but is also used in the Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Assyrian, and Eastern Catholic Churches, as well as by many Lutheran   and Anglican churches. 

Copernican principle<====>7327<====>Copernican principle  In physical cosmology, the Copernican principle, is an alternative name of the mediocrity principle, or the  principle of relativity, stating that  humans (the Earth, or the Solar system) are not privileged observers of the universe.  Named for Copernican heliocentrism, it is a working assumption that arises from a modified cosmological extension of Copernicus's argument of a moving Earth.   In some sense, it is equivalent to the mediocrity principle. Origin and implicationsHermann Bondi named the principle after Copernicus in the mid-20th century, although the principle itself dates back to the 16th-17th century paradigm shift away from the Ptolemaic system, which placed Earth at the center of the universe. 

Cyprinidae<====>7329<====>Cyprinidae  The Cyprinidae  are the family of freshwater fishes, collectively called  cyprinids, that includes the carps, the true minnows, and their relatives (for example, the barbs and barbels).   Also commonly called the "carp family", or "minnow family", Cyprinidae is the largest known fish family and the largest vertebrate animal family in general, with about 3,000 living and extinct species in about 370 genera.Eschmeyer, W. N. , Fong, J. D.  (2015) Species by family/subfamily in the Catalog of Fishes, California Academy of Sciences (retrieved 2 July 2015)  The family belongs to the ostariophysian order Cypriniformes, of whose genera and species the cyprinids make more than two-thirds. 

Complementary DNA<====>7330<====>Complementary DNA    In genetics, complementary DNA (cDNA) is DNA synthesized from a single stranded RNA (e. g. , messenger RNA (mRNA) or microRNA) template in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme reverse transcriptase.  cDNA is often used to clone eukaryotic genes in prokaryotes.   When scientists want to express a specific protein in a cell that does not normally express that protein (i. e. , heterologous expression), they will transfer the cDNA that codes for the protein to the recipient cell.   cDNA is also produced naturally by retroviruses (such as HIV-1, HIV-2, simian immunodeficiency virus, etc. 

Cellular digital packet data<====>7331<====>Cellular digital packet data  Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) was a wide-area mobile data service which used unused bandwidth normally used by AMPS mobile phones between 800 and 900 MHz to transfer data.  Speeds up to 19. 2 kbit/s were possible.  The service was discontinued in conjunction with the retirement of the parent AMPS service; it has been functionally replaced by faster services such as 1xRTT, EV-DO, and UMTS/HSPA. Developed in the early 1990s, CDPD was large on the horizon as a future technology.  However, it had difficulty competing against existing slower but less expensive Mobitex and DataTac systems, and never quite gained widespread acceptance before newer, faster standards such as GPRS became dominant. 

Creature of statute<====>7335<====>Creature of statute A creature of statute (also known as creature of the state) is a legal entity, such as a corporation, created by statute.  Creatures of statute may include municipalities and other artificial legal entities or relationships.Thus, when a statute in some fashion requires the formation of a corporate body—often for governmental purposes—such bodies when formed are known as "creatures of statute. " The same concept is also expressed with the phrase "creature of the state. " The term "creature of statute" is most common to the United States.  In the United Kingdom, these bodies are simply called statutory corporations (or statutory bodies) and generally have some governmental function. 

General Conference on Weights and Measures<====>7339<====>General Conference on Weights and Measures  The General Conference on Weights and Measures (  – CGPM) is the senior of the three Inter-governmental organizations established in 1875 under the terms of the Metre Convention ( ) to represent the interests of member states.   The treaty, which also set up two further bodies, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (  – CIPM) and the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (  –  BIPM), was drawn up to coordinate international metrology and to coordinate the development of the metric system. The conference meets in Sèvres (south-west of Paris) every four to six years. 

Cowboy Bebop<====>7341<====>Cowboy Bebop    is a 1998 anime television series animated by Sunrise featuring a production team led by director Shinichirō Watanabe, screenwriter Keiko Nobumoto, character designer Toshihiro Kawamoto, mechanical designer Kimitoshi Yamane, and composer Yoko Kanno.  The twenty-six episodes ("sessions") of the series are set in the year 2071, and follow the lives of a bounty hunter crew traveling on their spaceship called Bebop.  Cowboy Bebop explores philosophical concepts including existentialism, existential ennui, and loneliness. The series premiered in Japan on TV Tokyo from April 3 until June 26, 1998, broadcasting only twelve episodes and a special due to its controversial adult-themed content. 

Clement of Alexandria<====>7342<====>Clement of Alexandria  Titus Flavius Clemens ( ; c.  150 – c.  215),  known as Clement of Alexandria to distinguish him from the earlier Clement of Rome, was a Christian theologian who taught at the Catechetical School of Alexandria.  A convert to Christianity, he was an educated man who was familiar with classical Greek philosophy and literature.  As his three major works demonstrate, Clement was influenced by Hellenistic philosophy to a greater extent than any other Christian thinker of his time, and in particular by Plato and the Stoics.   His secret works, which exist only in fragments, suggest that he was also familiar with pre-Christian Jewish esotericism and Gnosticism. 

Cogito ergo sum<====>7344<====>Cogito ergo sumis a Latin philosophical proposition by   usually translated into English as "I think, therefore I am".  The phrase originally appeared in French as   in his Discourse on the Method, so as to reach a wider audience than Latin would have allowed.   It appeared in Latin in his later Principles of Philosophy.  As Descartes explained, "we cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt. . . . " A fuller form, penned by Antoine Léonard Thomas, aptly captures Descartes’s intent:   ("I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am"). 

Carl Barks<====>7345<====>Carl Barks   Carl Barks (March 27, 1901 – August 25, 2000) was an American cartoonist, author, and painter.  He is best known for his comics about Donald Duck and as the creator of Scrooge McDuck.  He worked anonymously until late in his career; fans dubbed him The Duck Man and The Good Duck Artist.  In 1987, Barks was one of the three inaugural inductees of the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame. Barks worked for the Disney Studio and Western Publishing where he created Duckburg and many of its inhabitants, such as Scrooge McDuck (1947), Gladstone Gander (1948), the Beagle Boys (1951), The Junior Woodchucks (1951), Gyro Gearloose (1952), Cornelius Coot (1952), Flintheart Glomgold (1956), John D. 

Centimetre–gram–second system of units<====>7346<====>Centimetre–gram–second system of units  The centimetre–gram–second system of units (abbreviated CGS or cgs) is a variant of the metric system based on the centimetre as the unit of length, the gram as the unit of mass, and the second as the unit of time.  All CGS mechanical units are unambiguously derived from these three base units, but there are several different ways of extending the CGS system to cover electromagnetism. The CGS system has been largely supplanted by the MKS system based on the metre, kilogram, and second, which was in turn extended and replaced by the International System of Units (SI). 

Christology<====>7355<====>Christology  Christology (from Greek Χριστός Khristós and  ,  ) is the field of study within Christian theology which is primarily concerned with the ontology and person of Jesus as recorded in the canonical Gospels and the epistles of the New Testament.  Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus by Gerald O'Collins 2009   pp.  1–3  Compare:    Primary considerations include the ontology and person of Jesus in conjunction with His relationship with that of God the Father.  As such, Christology is concerned with the details of Jesus' ministry, his acts and teachings, to arrive at a clearer understanding of who he is in his person, and his role in salvation. 

Complaint<====>7357<====>Complaint   In legal terminology, a complaint is any formal legal document that sets out the facts and legal reasons (see: cause of action) that the filing party or parties (the plaintiff(s)) believes are sufficient to support a claim against the party or parties against whom the claim is brought (the defendant(s)) that entitles the plaintiff(s) to a remedy (either money damages or injunctive relief).  For example, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) that govern civil litigation in United States courts provide that a civil action is commenced with the filing or service of a pleading called a complaint. 

Casimir III the Great<====>7362<====>Casimir III the Great  Casimir III the Great ( ; 30 April 1310 – 5 November 1370) reigned as the King of Poland from 1333 to 1370.  He was the son of King Władysław I ("the Elbow-high") and Duchess Jadwiga of Kalisz, and the last Polish king from the Piast dynasty.    Kazimierz inherited a kingdom weakened by war and made it prosperous and wealthy.  He reformed the Polish army and doubled the size of the kingdom.  He reformed the judicial system and introduced a legal code, gaining the title "the Polish Justinian. "    Kazimierz built extensively and founded the University of Kraków Saxton, 1851, p. 

Complexity<====>7363<====>Complexity  Complexity characterises the behaviour of a system or model whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, meaning there is no reasonable higher instruction to define the various possible interactions.    The stem of the word "complexity" - complex - combines the Latin roots com (meaning "together") and plex (meaning "woven").  Contrast "complicated" where plic (meaning "folded") refers to many layers.  A complex system is thereby characterised by its inter-dependencies, whereas a complicated system is characterised by its layers. Complexity is generally used to characterize something with many parts where those parts interact with each other in multiple ways, culminating in a higher order of emergence greater than the sum of its parts. 

Chastity<====>7366<====>Chastity  Chastity is sexual conduct of a person that is deemed praiseworthy and virtuous according to the moral standards and guidelines of their culture, civilization or religion.  The term has become closely associated (and is often used interchangeably) with sexual abstinence, especially before marriage and outside marriage.   EtymologyThe words "chaste" and "chastity" stem from the Latin adjective castus meaning "pure".  The words entered the English language around the middle of the 13th century; at that time they meant slightly different things.  "Chaste" meant "virtuous or pure from unlawful sexual intercourse" (referring to extramarital sex), Chaste at etymonline. 

Cosmic microwave background<====>7376<====>Cosmic microwave background  The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is electromagnetic radiation left over from an early stage of the universe in Big Bang cosmology.  In older literature, the CMB is also variously known as cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) or "relic radiation".  The CMB is a faint cosmic background radiation filling all space that is an important source of data on the early universe because it is the oldest electromagnetic radiation in the universe, dating to the epoch of recombination.  With a traditional optical telescope, the space between stars and galaxies (the background) is completely dark. 

Comparative law<====>7378<====>Comparative lawComparative law is the study of differences and similarities between the law of different countries.   More specifically, it involves study of the different legal "systems" (or "families") in existence in the world, including the common law, the civil law, socialist law, Canon law, Jewish Law, Islamic law, Hindu law, and Chinese law.  It includes the description and analysis of foreign legal systems, even where no explicit comparison is undertaken.   The importance of comparative law has increased enormously in the present age of internationalism, economic globalization and democratization. HistoryThe origins of modern comparative law can be traced back to 18th century Europe, although, prior to that, legal scholars had always practiced comparative methodologies. 

Cyberspace<====>7381<====>Cyberspace  Cyberspace refers to interconnected technology.  The term entered the popular culture from science fiction and the arts but is now used by technology strategists, security professionals, government, military and industry leaders and entrepreneurs to describe the domain of the global technology environment.  Others consider cyberspace to be just a notional environment in which communication over computer networks occurs.   The word became popular in the 1990s when the uses of the Internet, networking, and digital communication were all growing dramatically and the term "cyberspace" was able to represent the many new ideas and phenomena that were emerging. 

The Maritimes<====>7382<====>The Maritimes   The Maritimes, also called the Maritime provinces or the Canadian Maritimes, is a region of Eastern Canada consisting of three provinces: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island (PEI).  The Maritimes had a population of 1,813,606 in 2016.   The Maritimes, along with a fourth province – Canada's easternmost province, Newfoundland and Labrador – make up the region of Atlantic Canada. Located along the Atlantic coast, various aquatic sub-basins are located in the Maritimes, such as the Gulf of Maine and Gulf of St.  Lawrence.  The region is located northeast of New England, southeast of Quebec's Gaspé Peninsula, and southwest of the island of Newfoundland. 

Cyril of Alexandria<====>7383<====>Cyril of AlexandriaCyril of Alexandria ( ;  ; c.  376 – 444) was the Patriarch of Alexandria from 412 to 444.  He was enthroned when the city was at the height of its influence and power within the Roman Empire.  Cyril wrote extensively and was a leading protagonist in the Christological controversies of the late-4th and 5th centuries.  He was a central figure in the Council of Ephesus in 431, which led to the deposition of Nestorius as Patriarch of Constantinople. Cyril is counted among the Church Fathers and the Doctors of the Church, and his reputation within the Christian world has resulted in his titles Pillar of Faith and Seal of all the Fathers, but Theodosius II, the Roman Emperor, condemned him for behaving like a "proud pharaoh", and the Nestorian bishops at the Council of Ephesus declared him a heretic, labelling him as a "monster, born and educated for the destruction of the church. 

Cyril of Jerusalem<====>7387<====>Cyril of Jerusalem   Cyril of Jerusalem ( ;  ) was a distinguished theologian of the early Church (  313    386 AD).  He is venerated as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Church and the Anglican Communion.  In 1883, Cyril was declared a Doctor of the Church by Pope Leo XIII.  He is highly respected in the Palestinian Christian Community. About the end of 350 AD he succeeded Maximus as Bishop of Jerusalem, but was exiled on more than one occasion due to the enmity of Acacius of Caesarea, and the policies of various emperors. 

Hanukkah<====>7388<====>Hanukkah    Hanukkah (   ;    , Tiberian:  , usually spelled  , pronounced   in Modern Hebrew,   or   in Yiddish; a transliteration also romanized as Chanukah or Ḥanukah) is a Jewish holiday commemorating the rededication of the Holy Temple (the Second Temple) in Jerusalem at the time of the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire.  Hanukkah is observed for eight nights and days, starting on the 25th day of Kislev according to the Hebrew calendar, which may occur at any time from late November to late December in the Gregorian calendar. 

Christian views on marriage<====>7390<====>Christian views on marriageMarriage is the legal union of a couple as spouses—an intimate and complementing union, generally between a man and a woman, in which the two become one physically in the whole of life.  When a man and a woman get married, they commit themselves to spending their lives in a new relationship.  It is a partnership of love, made richer and deeper through sex.  Like many people, Christians regard it as the best context for nurturing children.  It is also seen as the best (many Christians would say the only) setting for sex. 

Class (computer programming)<====>7392<====>Class (computer programming) In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).    In many languages, the class name is used as the name for the class (the template itself), the name for the default constructor of the class (a subroutine that creates objects), and as the type of objects generated by instantiating the class; these distinct concepts are easily conflated.  When an object is created by a constructor of the class, the resulting object is called an instance of the class, and the member variables specific to the object are called instance variables, to contrast with the class variables shared across the class. 

Color blindness<====>7397<====>Color blindness   Color blindness, also known as color vision deficiency, is the decreased ability to see color or differences in color.   Color blindness can make some educational activities difficult.   Buying fruit, picking clothing, and reading traffic lights can be more challenging, for example.   Problems, however, are generally minor and most people adapt.   People with total color blindness, however, may also have decreased visual acuity and be uncomfortable in bright environments.   The most common cause of color blindness is an inherited fault in the development of one or more of the three sets of color sensing cones in the eye. 

Computer security<====>7398<====>Computer security Cyber security, computer security or IT security is the protection of computer systems from the theft and damage to their hardware, software or information, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. Cyber security includes controlling physical access to the hardware, as well as protecting against harm that may come via network access, data and code injection.   Also, due to malpractice by operators, whether intentional or accidental, IT security is susceptible to being tricked into deviating from secure procedures through various methods.  The field is of growing importance due to the increasing reliance on computer systems and the Internet,  wireless networks such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, the growth of "smart" devices, including smartphones, televisions and tiny devices as part of the Internet of Things. 

Chris Cunningham<====>7400<====>Chris Cunningham    Chris Cunningham (born 15 October 1970)  is a British video artist.  He has primarily directed music videos for ambient music and electronica acts such as Autechre and Aphex Twin.   He has also created art installations and directed short movies.   He was approached to direct a movie version of the cyberpunk novel Neuromancer, but nothing came of early discussions.   In the 2000s, Cunningham began doing music production work.   He has also designed album artwork for a variety of musicians. Early workAfter seeing Cunningham's work on the 1995 film version of Judge Dredd, Stanley Kubrick head-hunted Cunningham  to design and supervise animatronic tests of the central robot child character in his version of the film A. 

Centaur<====>7401<====>Centaur  A centaur ( ;  , Kéntauros,  ), or occasionally hippocentaur, is a mythological creature with the upper body of a human and the lower body and legs of a horse.   MythologyOriginThe centaurs were usually said to have been born of Ixion and Nephele (the cloud made in the image of Hera).  Another version, however, makes them children of a certain Centaurus, who mated with the Magnesian mares.  This Centaurus was either himself the son of Ixion and Nephele (inserting an additional generation) or of Apollo and Stilbe, daughter of the river god Peneus. 

Chemotaxis<====>7403<====>Chemotaxis Chemotaxis (from chemo- + taxis) is the movement of an organism in response to a chemical stimulus.   Somatic cells, bacteria, and other single-cell or multicellular organisms direct their movements according to certain chemicals in their environment.  This is important for bacteria to find food (e. g. , glucose) by swimming toward the highest concentration of food molecules, or to flee from poisons (e. g. , phenol).  In multicellular organisms, chemotaxis is critical to early development (e. g. , movement of sperm towards the egg during fertilization) and subsequent phases of development (e. g. , migration of neurons or lymphocytes) as well as in normal function. 

Cheshire<====>7406<====>Cheshire    Cheshire ( ;  archaically the County Palatine of Chester)  is a county in North West England, bordering Merseyside and Greater Manchester to the north, Derbyshire to the east, Staffordshire and Shropshire to the south and Wales to the west.  Cheshire's county town is Chester; the largest town is Warrington.  Other major towns include Congleton, Crewe, Ellesmere Port, Macclesfield, Northwich, Runcorn, Widnes, Wilmslow, and Winsford.    The county covers   and has a population of around 1 million.  It is mostly rural, with a number of small towns and villages supporting the agricultural and other industries which produce Cheshire cheese, salt, chemicals and silk. 

County town<====>7407<====>County town   A county town in the United Kingdom or Ireland is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the de facto main town of a county.  The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based.  Many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county.  For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire.   Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. 

Constitution of Canada<====>7411<====>Constitution of CanadaThe Constitution of Canada  is the supreme law in Canada;the country's constitution is an amalgamation of codified acts and uncodified traditions and conventions.  Canada is one of the oldest constitutional democracies in the world.The  constitution outlines Canada's system of government, as well as the civil rights of all Canadian citizens and those in Canada.    The composition of the Constitution of Canada is defined in subsection 52(2) of the Constitution Act, 1982 as consisting of the Canada Act 1982 (including the Constitution Act, 1982), all acts and orders referred to in the schedule (including the Constitution Act, 1867, formerly the British North America Act, 1867), and any amendments to these documents. 

Crochet<====>7424<====>Crochet Not to be confused with Crotchet, the common name for a Quarter note in music. Crochet ( ;    ) is a process of creating fabric by interlocking loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials using a crochet hook.The name is derived from the French term crochet, meaning 'small hook'.  These are made of materials such as metal, wood, or plastic and are manufactured commercially and produced in artisan workshops.  The salient difference between crochet and knitting, beyond the implements used for their production, is that each stitch in crochet is completed before proceeding with the next one, while knitting keeps a large number of stitches open at a time. 

Electromagnetic coil<====>7425<====>Electromagnetic coil An electromagnetic coil is an electrical conductor such as a wire in the shape of a  , spiral or helix.    Electromagnetic coils are used in electrical engineering, in applications where electric currents interact with magnetic fields, in devices such as electric motors, generators, inductors, electromagnets, transformers, and sensor coils.   Either an electric current is passed through the wire of the coil to generate a magnetic field,  or conversely an external time-varying magnetic field through the interior of the coil generates an EMF (voltage) in the conductor. 

Charles I of England<====>7426<====>Charles I of England    Charles I (19 November 1600 – 30 January 1649)  was monarch of the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 27 March 1625 until his execution in 1649. Charles was born into the House of Stuart as the second son of King James VI of Scotland, but after his father inherited the English throne in 1603, he moved to England, where he spent much of the rest of his life.  He became heir apparent to the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland on the death of his elder brother, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1612. 

Counter-Strike (video game)<====>7431<====>Counter-Strike (video game)   Counter-Strike (also known as Half-Life: Counter-Strike) is a first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation.  It was initially developed and released as a Half-Life modification by Minh "Gooseman" Le and Jess Cliffe in 1999, before Le and Cliffe were hired and the game's intellectual property acquired.  Counter-Strike was released by Valve on the Microsoft Windows platform in 2000.  The game spawned a franchise, and is the first installment in the Counter-Strike series.  Several remakes and Ports of Counter-Strike have been released on the Xbox console, as well as OS X and Linux. 

Camille Pissarro<====>7434<====>Camille Pissarro   Camille Pissarro ( ; 10 July 1830 – 13 November 1903) was a Danish-French Impressionist and Neo-Impressionist painter born on the island of St Thomas (now in the US Virgin Islands, but then in the Danish West Indies).  His importance resides in his contributions to both Impressionism and Post-Impressionism.  Pissarro studied from great forerunners, including Gustave Courbet and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot.  He later studied and worked alongside Georges Seurat and Paul Signac when he took on the Neo-Impressionist style at the age of 54. In 1873 he helped establish a collective society of fifteen aspiring artists, becoming the "pivotal" figure in holding the group together and encouraging the other members. 

Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures<====>7435<====>Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures  The diagnostic tests in cardiology are methods of identifying heart conditions associated with healthy vs.  unhealthy, pathologic heart function. BedsideHistoryObtaining a medical history is always the first "test", part of understanding the likelihood of significant disease, as detectable within the current limitations of clinical medicine.  Yet heart problems often produce no symptoms until very advanced, and many symptoms, such as palpitations and sensations of extra or missing heart beats correlate poorly with relative heart health vs disease.  Hence, a history alone is rarely sufficient to diagnose a heart condition. AuscultationAuscultation employs a stethoscope to more easily hear various normal and abnormal sounds, such as normal heart beat sounds and the usual heart beat sound changes associated with breathing versus heart murmurs. 

Carlo Collodi<====>7437<====>Carlo Collodi  Carlo Lorenzini, better known by the pen name Carlo Collodi ( ; 24 November 1826 – 26 October 1890), was an Italian author and journalist,  widely known for his world-renowned fairy tale novel The Adventures of Pinocchio. Early lifeCollodi was born in Florence on 24 November 1826.  He spent most of his childhood in the town of Collodi where his mother was born. His mother was a farmer's daughter and his father was a cook. He had 10 siblings but seven died at a young age. CareerDuring the Italian wars of Independence in 1848 and 1860 Collodi served as a volunteer with the Tuscan army. 

Constructible number<====>7439<====>Constructible number In geometry and algebra, a real number   is constructible if and only if, given a line segment of unit length, a line segment of length | | can be constructed with compass and straightedge in a finite number of steps.    Not all real numbers are constructible and to describe those that are, algebraic techniques are usually employed.  However, in order to employ those techniques, it is useful to first associate points with constructible numbers. A point in the Euclidean plane is a constructible point if it is either endpoint of the given unit segment, or the point of intersection of two lines determined by previously obtained constructible points, or the intersection of such a line and a circle having a previously obtained constructible point as a center passing through another constructible point, or the intersection of two such circles. 

Carson City, Nevada<====>7441<====>Carson City, Nevada   Carson City, officially the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City, is an independent city and the capital of the US state of Nevada, named after the mountain man Kit Carson.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 55,274.The majority of the population of the town lives in Eagle Valley, on the eastern edge of the Carson Range, a branch of the Sierra Nevada, about   south of Reno.  The town originated as a stopover for California bound emigrants, but developed into a city with the Comstock Lode, a silver strike in the mountains to the northeast. 

Clark Kent<====>7442<====>Clark Kent {{Infobox comics character   In 1978, the first of four Superman films was made in which Clark Kent and Superman were portrayed by Christopher Reeve (with teenage Kent played by Jeff East in the first film).  This was followed nearly two decades later by a fifth film called Superman Returns with Brandon Routh giving a performance very similar to Reeve's.  In contrast to George Reeves' intellectual Clark Kent, Reeve's version is much more of an awkward fumbler and bungler, although Reeve is also an especially athletic, dashing and debonair Superman.  Clark Kent's hair is always absolutely flat, while Superman's hair has a slight wave and is parted on the opposite side as Kent's. 

Classification of finite simple groups<====>7445<====>Classification of finite simple groups In mathematics, the classification of the finite simple groups is a theorem stating that every finite simple group belongs to one of four broad classes described below.  These groups can be seen as the basic building blocks of all finite groups, in a way reminiscent of the way the prime numbers are the basic building blocks of the natural numbers.   The Jordan–Hölder theorem is a more precise way of stating this fact about finite groups.  However, a significant difference from  integer factorization is that such "building blocks" do not necessarily determine  a unique group, since there might be many non-isomorphic groups with the same composition series or, put in another way, the extension problem does not have a unique solution.

Circumcision and law<====>7447<====>Circumcision and law  Laws restricting, regulating, or banning circumcision, some dating back to ancient times, have been enacted in many countries and communities.  In a number of modern states, circumcision is presumed to be legal, but laws pertaining to assault or child custody have been applied in cases involving circumcision.  In the case of non-therapeutic circumcision of children, proponents of laws in favor of the procedure often point to the rights of the parents or practitioners, namely the right of freedom to religion.  Those against the procedure point to the boy's right of freedom from religion. 

Called to Common Mission<====>7449<====>Called to Common Mission Called to Common Mission is an agreement between The Episcopal Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), establishing full communion between them.  It was ratified by the ELCA in 1999, the ECUSA in 2000, after the narrow failure of a previous agreement.  Its principal author on the Episcopal side was the J.  Robert Wright.   Under the agreement, they recognize the validity of each other's baptisms and ordinations.  The agreement provided that the ELCA would accept the historical episcopate, something which became controversial in the ELCA.  In response to concerns about the meaning of CCM, bishops in the ELCA drafted Tucson Resolution, which presented the official ELCA position. 

Context menu<====>7450<====>Context menu A context menu (also called contextual, shortcut, and pop up or pop-up menu) is a menu in a graphical user interface (GUI) that appears upon user interaction, such as a right-click mouse operation.  A context menu offers a limited set of choices that are available in the current state, or context, of the operating system or application to which the menu belongs.  Usually the available choices are actions related to the selected object.  From a technical point of view, such a context menu is a graphical control element. HistoryContext menus first appeared in the Smalltalk environment on the Xerox Alto computer, where they were called pop-up menus. 

Jews as the chosen people<====>7451<====>Jews as the chosen people   In Judaism, "chosenness" is the belief that the Jews, via descent from the ancient Israelites, are the chosen people, i. e.  chosen to be in a covenant with God.  The idea of the Israelites being chosen by God is found most directly in the Book of Deuteronomy  as the verb bahar ( ), and is alluded to elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible using other terms such as "holy people".   Much is written about these topics in rabbinic literature.  The three largest Jewish denominations— Orthodox Judaism, Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism—maintain the belief that the Jews have been chosen by God for a purpose. 

Chaparral<====>7455<====>Chaparral Chaparral is a shrubland or heathland plant community found primarily in the US state of California and in the northern portion of the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico.  It is shaped by a Mediterranean climate (mild, wet winters and hot dry summers) and wildfire, featuring summer-drought-tolerant plants with hard sclerophyllous evergreen leaves, as contrasted with the associated soft-leaved, drought-deciduous, scrub community of coastal sage scrub, found below the chaparral biome.   Chaparral covers 5% of the state of California, and associated Mediterranean shrubland an additional 3. 5%.The name comes from the Spanish word for scrub oak, chaparro. 

Clipper<====>7461<====>Clipper A clipper was a very fast sailing ship of the middle third of the 19th century.  They had three masts and a square rig.  They were generally narrow for their length, small by later 19th century standards, could carry limited bulk freight, and had a large total sail area.  Clipper ships were mostly constructed in British and American shipyards, though France, Brazil, the Netherlands and other nations also produced some.  Clippers sailed all over the world, primarily on the trade routes between the United Kingdom and its colonies in the east, in trans-Atlantic trade, and on the New York-to-San Francisco route round Cape Horn during the California Gold Rush. 

Clive Anderson<====>7462<====>Clive Anderson   Clive Stuart Anderson (born 10 December 1952 in Stanmore, Middlesex) is an English television and radio presenter, comedy writer and former barrister.  Winner of a British Comedy Award in 1991,  Anderson began experimenting with comedy and writing comedic scripts during his 15-year legal career, before starring in Whose Line Is It Anyway? on BBC Radio 4, then later Channel 4.  He has also hosted a number of radio programmes, and made guest appearances on Have I Got News for You, Mock the Week and  QI.  Early lifeAnderson was educated at Stanburn Primary School and Harrow County School for Boys  where his group of friends included Geoffrey Perkins and Michael Portillo. 

Cold fusion<====>7463<====>Cold fusion    Cold fusion is a hypothesized type of nuclear reaction that would occur at, or near, room temperature.  This is compared with the "hot" fusion which takes place naturally within stars, under immense pressure and at temperatures of millions of degrees, and distinguished from muon-catalyzed fusion.  There is currently no accepted theoretical model that would allow cold fusion to occur. In 1989 Martin Fleischmann (then one of the world's leading electrochemists) and Stanley Pons reported that their apparatus had produced anomalous heat ("excess heat") of a magnitude they asserted would defy explanation except in terms of nuclear processes. 

Coal tar<====>7466<====>Coal tar  Coal tar is a thick dark liquid which is a by-product of the production of coke and coal gas from coal.    It has both medical and industrial uses.    As a medication it is used to treat psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff).   It is used by application to the affected area and may be used together with ultraviolet light therapy.Industrial uses include preservation of railway ties and improving the surface of roads.   Side effects include skin irritation, sun sensitivity, allergic reactions, and skin discoloration.

Catherine of Siena<====>7471<====>Catherine of Siena  Saint Catherine of Siena   (March 25, 1347 in Siena – April 29, 1380 in Rome), was a tertiary of the Dominican Order and a Scholastic philosopher and theologian.  She also worked to bring the papacy of Gregory XI back to Rome from its displacement in France and to establish peace among the Italian city-states.  She is believed, in Catholicism, to have had miraculous visions and felt herself to be united in marriage with Jesus,    stating in her letters that she wore the wedding ring he gave her but that it was invisible. 

Charles Lyell<====>7472<====>Charles Lyell    Sir Charles Lyell, 1st Baronet,   (14 November 1797 – 22 February 1875) was a Scottish geologist who popularised the revolutionary work of James Hutton.  He is best known as the author of Principles of Geology, which presented uniformitarianism–the idea that the Earth was shaped by the same scientific processes still in operation today–to the broad general public.  Principles of Geology also challenged theories popularised by Georges Cuvier, which were the most accepted and circulated ideas about geology in Europe at the time.  Cannon, Walter F.

Founded in 1905, the club's home ground since then has been Stamford Bridge.    Chelsea won the First Division title in 1955, various cup competitions between 1965 and 1971 and 21 trophies since 1997,  including six titles, seven FA Cups, five League Cups and four FA Community Shields, one UEFA Champions League, two UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, one UEFA Europa League and one UEFA Super Cup. Chelsea's regular kit colours are royal blue shirts and shorts with white socks. 

CANDU reactor<====>7475<====>CANDU reactor The CANDU, for Canada Deuterium Uranium, is a Canadian pressurized heavy water reactor design used to generate electric power.  The acronym refers to its deuterium oxide (heavy water) moderator and its use of (originally, natural) uranium fuel.  CANDU reactors were first developed in the late 1950s and 1960s by a partnership between Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL), the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, Canadian General Electric, and other companies. There have been two major types of CANDU reactors, the original design of around 500 MWe that was intended to be used in multi-reactor installations in large plants, and the rationalized CANDU 6 in the 600 MWe class that is designed to be used in single stand-alone units or in small multi-unit plants. 

Cuitláhuac<====>7477<====>Cuitláhuac  Cuitláhuac ( ,  ) (c.  1476 – 1520)   or Cuitláhuac (in Spanish orthography;  ,   , honorific form Cuitlahuatzin) was the 10th tlatoani (ruler) of the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan for 80 days during the year Two Flint (1520).  Chimalpahin (1997): pp.  56–57, 164–165, 216–217.  BiographyEarly rule of TenochtitlanCuitláhuac was the eleventh son of the ruler Axayacatl and a younger brother of Moctezuma II, the previous ruler of Tenochtitlan.   His mother's father, also called Cuitlahuac, had been ruler of Iztapalapa,  and the younger Cuitláhuac also ruled there initially. 

Cuauhtémoc<====>7478<====>Cuauhtémoc  Cuauhtémoc ( ,   also known as Cuauhtemotzin, Guatimozin or Guatemoc; c.  1495) was the Aztec ruler (tlatoani) of Tenochtitlan from 1520 to 1521, making him the last Aztec Emperor.   The name Cuauhtemōc means "one who has descended like an eagle", and is commonly rendered in English as "Descending Eagle", as in the moment when an eagle folds its wings and plummets down to strike its prey.  This is a name that implies aggressiveness and determination. Cuauhtémoc took power in 1520 as successor of Cuitláhuac and was a cousin of the late emperor Moctezuma II. 

Cross section (physics)<====>7480<====>Cross section (physics) When two particles interact, their mutual cross section is the area transverse to their relative motion within which they must meet in order to scatter from each other.  If the particles are hard spheres that interact only upon contact, their scattering cross section is related to their geometric size.  If the particles interact through some action-at-a-distance force, such as electromagnetism or gravity, their scattering cross section is generally larger than their geometric size.  When a cross section is specified as a function of some final-state variable, such as particle angle or energy, it is called a "differential cross section". 

Christian mythology<====>7482<====>Christian mythology   Christian mythology is the body of myths associated with Christianity.  The term encompasses a broad variety of stories and legends.  Various authors have used it to refer to the mythological and allegorical elements found in the Bible, such as the story of the Leviathan.  The term has been applied to myths and legends from the Middle Ages, such as the story of Saint George and the Dragon, the stories of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, and the legends of the Parsival.  John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost has been classified as a work of "Christian mythology" by multiple commentators. 

Corporation<====>7485<====>Corporation    A corporation is a company or group of people authorized to act as a single entity (legally a person) and recognized as such in law.  Early incorporated entities were established by charter (i. e.  by an ad hoc act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature).  Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration. Corporations come in many different types but are usually divided by the law of the jurisdiction where they are chartered into two kinds: by whether they can issue stock or not, or by whether they are formed to make a profit or not. 

Fairchild Channel F<====>7487<====>Fairchild Channel F The Fairchild Channel F is a home video game console released by Fairchild Semiconductor in November 1976 across North America  at the retail price of $169. 95.  It was also released in Japan in October the following year.  It has the distinction of being the first programmable ROM cartridge–based video game console, and the first console to use a microprocessor.  It was launched as the Video Entertainment System, or VES, but when Atari released its VCS the next year, Fairchild renamed its machine.  By 1977, the Fairchild Channel F had sold 250,000 units, trailing behind sales of the VCS. 

Collation<====>7489<====>Collation Collation is the assembly of written information into a standard order.  Many systems of collation are based on numerical order or alphabetical order, or extensions and combinations thereof.  Collation is a fundamental element of most office filing systems, library catalogs, and reference books. Collation differs from classification in that classification is concerned with arranging information into logical categories, while collation is concerned with the ordering of items of information, usually based on the form of their identifiers.  Formally speaking, a collation method typically defines a total order on a set of possible identifiers, called sort keys, which consequently produces a total preorder on the set of items of information (items with the same identifier are not placed in any defined order). 

Civil Rights Act<====>7490<====>Civil Rights ActCivil Rights Act may refer to several acts of the United States Congress, including:Civil Rights Act of 1866, extending the rights of emancipated slaves by stating that any person born in the United States regardless of race is a US citizenCivil Rights Act of 1871, prohibiting ethnic violence against African AmericansCivil Rights Act of 1875, prohibiting discrimination in "public accommodations"; found unconstitutional in 1883 as Congress could not regulate conduct of individualsCivil Rights Act of 1957, establishing the Civil Rights CommissionCivil Rights Act of 1960, establishing federal inspection of local voter registration pollsCivil Rights Act of 1964, prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin by federal and state governments as well as some public placesCivil Rights Act of 1968, prohibiting discrimination in sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, creed, and national originCivil Rights Act of 1991, providing the right to trial by jury on discrimination claims and introducing the possibility of emotional distress damages, while limiting the amount that a jury could awardSee alsoCivil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, specifying that recipients of federal funds must comply with civil rights laws in all areas, not just in the particular program or activity that received federal fundingList of short titlesUnruh Civil Rights Act, a 1959 Californian law prohibiting discrimination in housingVoting Rights Act of 1965 

Cola<====>7491<====>Cola   Cola is a sweetened, carbonated soft drink, made from ingredients that contain caffeine from the kola nut and non-cocaine derivatives from coca leaves, flavored with vanilla and other ingredients.  Most colas now use other flavoring (and caffeinating) ingredients with a similar taste.  Colas became popular worldwide after pharmacist John Pemberton invented Coca-Cola in 1886.His non-alcoholic recipe was inspired by the coca wine of pharmacist Angelo Mariani, created in 1863.  Modern colas usually contain caramel color, caffeine, and sweeteners such as sugar or high-fructose corn syrup.  They now come in numerous different brands. 

Capability Maturity Model<====>7492<====>Capability Maturity ModelThe Capability Maturity Model (CMM)  is a development model created after a study of data collected from organizations that contracted with the U. S.  Department of Defense, who funded the research.   The term "maturity" relates to the degree of formality and optimization of processes, from ad hoc practices, to formally defined steps, to managed result metrics, to active optimization of the processes. The model's aim is to improve existing software development processes, but it can also be applied to other processes. OverviewThe Capability Maturity Model was originally developed as a tool for objectively assessing the ability of government contractors' processes to implement a contracted software project. 

RDX<====>7499<====>RDX   RDX is the organic compound with the formula (O 2 NNCH 2 ) 3 .  It is a white solid without smell or taste, widely used as an explosive.   Chemically, it is classified as a nitramide, chemically similar to HMX.  A more energetic explosive than TNT, it was used widely in World War II. It is often used in mixtures with other explosives and plasticizers or phlegmatizers (desensitizers).  RDX is stable in storage and is considered one of the most energetic and brisant of the military high explosives.    NameRDX also is known, but less commonly, as cyclonite, hexogen (particularly in Russian, French, German and German-influenced languages), T4, and, chemically, as cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine. 

Christianity and Judaism<====>7502<====>Christianity and Judaism   Christianity is rooted in Second Temple Judaism, but the two religions diverged in the first centuries of the Christian Era.  Christianity emphasizes correct belief (or orthodoxy), focusing on the New Covenant as mediated through Jesus Christ,    as recorded in the New Testament.  Judaism places emphasis on right conduct (or orthopraxy), focusing on the Mosaic Covenant, as recorded in the Torah and Talmud. Christians believe in individual salvation from sin through repentance and receiving Jesus Christ as their God and Savior through Faith in Christianity.  Jews believe in individual and collective participation in an eternal dialogue with God through tradition, rituals, prayers and ethical actions. 

Cesare Borgia<====>7504<====>Cesare Borgia  Cesare Borgia ( ; Catalan:  ;  ,  ; 13 September 1475   – 12 March 1507), Duke of Valentinois,  was an Italian   condottiero, nobleman, politician, and cardinal, whose fight for power was a major inspiration for The Prince by Machiavelli.  He was the son of Pope Alexander VI (r.  1492–1503, born Rodrigo Borgia) and his long-term mistress Vannozza dei Cattanei.  He was the brother of Lucrezia Borgia; Giovanni Borgia (Juan), Duke of Gandia; and Gioffre Borgia (Jofré in Valencian), Prince of Squillace.   He was half-brother to Don Pedro Luis de Borja (1460–88) and Girolama de Borja, children of unknown mothers. 

Chronicle<====>7507<====>Chronicle  A chronicle ( , from Greek  , from  , chronos, "time") is a historical account of facts and events ranged in chronological order, as in a time line.  Typically, equal weight is given for historically important events and local events, the purpose being the recording of events that occurred, seen from the perspective of the chronicler.  This is in contrast to a narrative or history, which sets selected events in a meaningful interpretive context and excludes those the author does not see as important. Where a chronicler obtained the information varies; some chronicles are written from first-hand knowledge, some are from witnesses or participants in events, still others are accounts passed mouth to mouth prior to being written down. 

Concentration<====>7512<====>Concentration In chemistry, concentration is the abundance of a constituent divided by the total volume of a mixture.  Several types of mathematical description can be distinguished: mass concentration, molar concentration, number concentration, and volume concentration.The term concentration can be applied to any kind of chemical mixture, but most frequently it refers to solutes and solvents in solutions.  The molar (amount) concentration has variants such as normal concentration and osmotic concentration.  Qualitative descriptionOften in informal, non-technical language, concentration is described in a qualitative way, through the use of adjectives such as "dilute" for solutions of relatively low concentration and "concentrated" for solutions of relatively high concentration. 

Christine Lavin<====>7514<====>Christine Lavin  Christine Lavin (born January 2, 1952) is a New York City-based singer-songwriter and promoter of contemporary folk music.   She has recorded numerous solo albums, and has also recorded with other female folk artists under the name Four Bitchin' Babes.   She has also put together several compilation albums of contemporary folk artists, including her latest Just One Angel, 22 singer/songwriters singing Christmas/Hanukah/Solstice/New Year's songs including actor Jeff Daniels, Grammy-winners Janis Ian and Julie Gold, and the Guitar Man Of Central Park David Ippolito. She is known for her sense of humor, which is expressed in both her music and her onstage performances. 

Cutter Expansive Classification<====>7515<====>Cutter Expansive ClassificationThe Cutter Expansive Classification system is a library classification system devised by Charles Ammi Cutter.  The system was the basis for the top categories of the Library of Congress Classification.  History of the Expansive ClassificationCharles Ammi Cutter (1837–1903), inspired by the decimal classification of his contemporary Melvil Dewey, and with Dewey's initial encouragement, developed his own classification scheme for the Winchester Town Library and then the Boston Athenaeum,  at which he served as librarian for twenty-four years.  He began work on it around the year 1880, publishing an overview of the new system in 1882. 

Cem Karaca<====>7516<====>Cem Karaca  Muhtar Cem Karaca (5 April 1945 – 8 February 2004) was a prominent Turkish rock musician and one of the most important figures in the Anatolian rock movement.   He is a graduate of Robert College.  He worked with various Turkish rock bands such as Apaşlar, Kardaşlar, Moğollar and Dervişan.  With these bands, he brought a new understanding and interpretation to Turkish Rock.  BiographyHe was the only child of Mehmet İbrahim Karaca, a theatre actor of Azerbaijani origin,and İrma Felekyan (Toto Karaca), a popular opera, theatre and movie actress  of Armenian origin. 

Calista Flockhart<====>7517<====>Calista Flockhart Calista Kay Flockhart (born November 11, 1964)  is an American actress.  She is best known for starring as the title character in the legal comedy-drama series Ally  McBeal (1997–2002), Kitty Walker in the drama series Brothers & Sisters (2006–2011) and Cat Grant in the superhero drama series Supergirl (2015–present).  She has also been featured in a number of films, including the comedy film The Birdcage (1996), the romantic comedy film A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999), and the drama film Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her (2000). 

Convolution<====>7519<====>Convolution In mathematics (and, in particular, functional analysis) convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions (f and g) to produce a third function, that is typically viewed as a modified version of one of the original functions, giving the integral of the pointwise multiplication of the two functions as a function of the amount that one of the original functions is translated . Convolution is similar to cross-correlation.  For discrete real valued signals, they differ only in a time reversal in one of the signals.  For continuous signals, the cross-correlation operator is the adjoint operator of the convolution operator. 

Calico<====>7521<====>Calico Calico (in British usage since 1505 ) is a plain-woven textile made from unbleached and often not fully processed cotton.  It may contain unseparated husk parts, for example.  The fabric is far less fine than muslin, but less coarse and thick than canvas or denim, but it is still very cheap owing to its unfinished and undyed appearance. The fabric was originally from the city of Calicut in southwestern India.  It was made by the traditional weavers called cāliyans.  The raw fabric was dyed and printed in bright hues, and calico prints became popular in Europe. 

Calorimetry<====>7522<====>Calorimetry Calorimetry is the science or act of measuring changes in state variables of a body for the purpose of deriving the heat transfer associated with changes of its state due, for example, to chemical reactions, physical changes, or phase transitions under specified constraints.    Calorimetry is performed with a calorimeter.  The word calorimetry is derived from the Latin word calor, meaning heat and the Greek word μέτρον (metron), meaning measure.   Scottish physician and scientist Joseph Black, who was the first to recognize the distinction between heat and temperature, is said to be the founder of the science of calorimetry. 

Charles Evans Hughes<====>7525<====>Charles Evans Hughes  Charles Evans Hughes Sr.  (April 11, 1862 – August 27, 1948) was an American statesman, Republican politician from New York, and the 11th Chief Justice of the United States.  He was also the 36th Governor of New York, the Republican presidential nominee in the 1916 presidential election, and the 44th United States Secretary of State. Born to Welsh immigrants in New York, Hughes became a prominent attorney and academic.  After taking part in the Armstrong Investigation, he won election as the Governor of New York, serving in that position from 1907–1910.  He became known as a progressive reformer and an admirer of Britain's New Liberalism, enacting legislation such as the Moreland Act. 

Concept album<====>7527<====>Concept album  A concept album is an album in which its tracks hold a larger purpose or meaning collectively than they do individually.    This is typically achieved through a single central narrative or theme, which can be instrumental, compositional, or lyrical.   Sometimes the term is referenced to albums considered to be of "uniform excellence" rather than an LP with an explicit musical or lyrical motif.   The exact criterion for a "concept album" varies among critics, with no discernible consensus.    The format originates with folk singer Woody Guthrie's Dust Bowl Ballads (1940) and subsequently popularized by traditional pop singer Frank Sinatra's 1940s–50s string of albums, but the term is more often associated with rock music. 

Cro-hook<====>7530<====>Cro-hookThe cro-hook, is a special double-ended crochet hook used to make double-sided crochet.  It employs the use of a long double-ended hook, which permits the maker to work stitches on or off from either end.Because the hook has two ends, two alternating colors of thread can be used simultaneously and freely interchanged, working loops over the hook. Crafts using a double-ended hook are commercially marketed as Cro-hook and Crochenit.  Cro-hook is a variation of Tunisian crochet and also shows similarities with the Afghan stitch used to make Afghan scarves, but the fabric is typically softer with greater elasticity. 

Clavichord<====>7531<====>Clavichord The clavichord is a European stringed keyboard instrument that was used largely in the late Medieval, through the Renaissance, Baroque and Classical eras.  Historically, it was mostly used as a practice instrument and as an aid to composition, not being loud enough for larger performances.  The clavichord produces sound by striking brass or iron strings with small metal blades called tangents.  Vibrations are transmitted through the bridge(s) to the soundboard. NameThe name is derived from the Latin word clavis, meaning "key" (associated with more common clavus, meaning "nail, rod, etc. ") and chorda (from Greek χορδή) meaning "string, especially of a musical instrument". 

Centripetal force<====>7534<====>Centripetal force    A centripetal force (from Latin centrum, "center" and petere, "to seek" ) is a force that makes a body follow a curved path.  Its direction is always orthogonal to the motion of the body and towards the fixed point of the instantaneous center of curvature of the path.  Isaac Newton described it as "a force by which bodies are drawn or impelled, or in any way tend, towards a point as to a centre".   In Newtonian mechanics, gravity provides the centripetal force responsible for astronomical orbits. One common example involving centripetal force is the case in which a body moves with uniform speed along a circular path. 

Checksum<====>7538<====>Checksum A checksum is a small-sized datum derived from a block of digital data for the purpose of detecting errors which may have been introduced during its transmission or storage.   It is usually applied to an installation file after it is received from the download server.   By themselves, checksums are often used to verify data integrity but are not relied upon to verify data authenticity. The actual procedure which yields the checksum from a data input is called a checksum function or checksum algorithm.  Depending on its design goals, a good checksum algorithm will usually output a significantly different value, even for small changes made to the input. 

City University of New York<====>7541<====>City University of New York   The City University of New York (CUNY; pron. :  ) is the public university system of New York City, and the largest urban university system in the United States.  CUNY and the State University of New York (SUNY) are separate and independent university systems, despite the fact that both public institutions receive funding from New York State.  CUNY, however, is only located in New York City, while SUNY is located in the entire state, including New York City. Enrollment and demographicsCUNY is the third-largest university system in the United States, in terms of enrollment, behind the State University of New York (SUNY), and the California State University system. 

Computational complexity theory<====>7543<====>Computational complexity theory Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other.  A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm. A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used.  The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. 

Camelot<====>7546<====>Camelot   Camelot is a castle and court associated with the legendary King Arthur.  Absent in the early Arthurian material, Camelot first appeared in 12th-century French romances and, after the Lancelot-Grail cycle, eventually came to be described as the fantastic capital of Arthur's realm and a symbol of the Arthurian world.  The stories locate it somewhere in Great Britain and sometimes associate it with real cities, though more usually its precise location is not revealed.  Most scholars regard it as being entirely fictional, its geography being perfect for chivalric romance writers.  Nevertheless, arguments about the location of the "real Camelot" have occurred since the 15th century and continue to rage today in popular works and for tourism purposes. 

Contras<====>7548<====>Contras    The Contras were the various U. S. -backed and funded right-wing rebel groups that were active from 1979 to the early 1990s in opposition to the left-wing, socialist Sandinista Junta of National Reconstruction government in Nicaragua.  Among the separate contra groups, the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN) emerged as the largest by far.  In 1987, virtually all contra organizations were united, at least nominally, into the Nicaraguan Resistance. During their war against the Nicaraguan government, the Contras committed a large number of human rights violations and used terrorist tactics,   carrying out more than 1300 terrorist attacks. 

Craig Venter<====>7550<====>Craig Venter  John Craig Venter (born October 14, 1946) is an American biotechnologist, biochemist, geneticist, and businessman.  He is known for being involved with sequencing the second human genome  and assembled the first team to transfect a cell with a synthetic chromosome.    Venter founded Celera Genomics, The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) and the J.  Craig Venter Institute (JCVI).  He was the co-founder of Human Longevity Inc. , served as its CEO until 2017, and is executive chairman of the board of directors.He was listed on Time magazine's 2007 and 2008 Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world. 

Carl Rogers<====>7554<====>Carl Rogers  Carl Ransom Rogers (January 8, 1902 – February 4, 1987) was an American psychologist and among the founders of the humanistic approach (or client-centered approach) to psychology.  Rogers is widely considered to be one of the founding fathers of psychotherapy research and was honored for his pioneering research with the Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions by the American Psychological Association (APA) in 1956. The person-centered approach, his own unique approach to understanding personality and human relationships, found wide application in various domains such as psychotherapy and counseling (client-centered therapy), education (student-centered learning), organizations, and other group settings. 

Casimir effect<====>7555<====>Casimir effect  In quantum field theory, the Casimir effect and the Casimir–Polder force are physical forces arising from a quantized field.  They are named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Casimir who predicted them in 1948. The typical example is of the two uncharged conductive plates in a vacuum, placed a few nanometers apart.  In a classical description, the lack of an external field means that there is no field between the plates, and no force would be measured between them.   When this field is instead studied using the quantum electrodynamic vacuum, it is seen that the plates do affect the virtual photons which constitute the field, and generate a net force  – either an attraction or a repulsion depending on the specific arrangement of the two plates. 

Coin<====>7558<====>Coin   A coin is a small, flat, (usually) round piece of metal or plastic used primarily as a medium of exchange or legal tender.  They are standardized in weight, and produced in large quantities at a mint in order to facilitate trade.  They are most often issued by a government. Coins are usually metal or alloy, or sometimes made of synthetic materials.  They are usually disc shaped.  Coins made of valuable metal are stored in large quantities as bullion coins.  Other coins are used as money in everyday transactions, circulating alongside banknotes.  Usually the highest value coin in circulation (i.

Classical Kuiper belt object<====>7561<====>Classical Kuiper belt object A classical Kuiper belt object, also called a cubewano (  "QB1-o"),  is a low-eccentricity Kuiper belt object (KBO) that orbits beyond Neptune and is not controlled by an orbital resonance with Neptune.  Cubewanos have orbits with semi-major axes in the 40–50 AU range and, unlike Pluto, do not cross Neptune’s orbit.  That is, they have low-eccentricity and sometimes low-inclination orbits like the classical planets. The name "cubewano" derives from the first trans-Neptunian object (TNO) found after Pluto and Charon,  .   Similar objects found later were often called "QB1-o's", or "cubewanos", after this object, though the term "classical" is much more frequently used in the scientific literature. 

Foreign policy of the United States<====>7564<====>Foreign policy of the United States    The foreign policy of the United States is the way in which it interacts with foreign nations and sets standards of interaction for its organizations, corporations and system citizens of the United States. The officially stated goals of the foreign policy of the United States, including all the Bureaus and Offices in the United States Department of State,  as mentioned in the Foreign Policy Agenda of the Department of State, are "to build and sustain a more democratic, secure, and prosperous world for the benefit of the American people and the international community. 

Christmas in Poland<====>7565<====>Christmas in Poland Christmas in Poland is a major annual celebration, as in most countries of the Christian world.  The observance of Christmas developed gradually over the centuries, beginning in ancient times; combining old Polish pagan customs with the religious ones introduced after the Christianization of Poland by the Catholic Church.  Later influences include mutual permeating of local traditions and various folk cultures.  It is one of the most important religious holidays for Poles, who follow a somewhat strict traditional custom.  Christmas trees are decorated and lit in family rooms on the day of Christmas Eve. 

Carousel (musical)<====>7566<====>Carousel (musical) Carousel is the second musical by the team of Richard Rodgers (music) and Oscar Hammerstein II (book and lyrics).  The 1945 work was adapted from Ferenc Molnár's 1909 play Liliom, transplanting its Budapest setting  to the Maine coastline.   The story revolves around  carousel barker Billy Bigelow, whose romance with millworker Julie Jordan comes at the price of both their jobs.   He attempts a robbery to provide for Julie and their unborn child; after it goes wrong, he is given a chance to make things right.   A secondary plot line deals with millworker Carrie Pipperidge and her romance with ambitious fisherman Enoch Snow. 

Christian alternative rock<====>7572<====>Christian alternative rock   Christian alternative rock is a form of alternative rock music that is lyrically grounded in a Christian worldview.  Some critics have suggested that unlike CCM and older Christian rock, Christian alternative rock generally emphasizes musical style over lyrical content as a defining genre characteristic,    though the degree to which the faith appears in the music varies from artist to artist. HistoryChristian alternative music has its roots in the early 1980s, as the earliest efforts at Christian punk and new wave were recorded by artists like Andy McCarroll and Moral Support, Undercover, The 77s, Steve Scott, Adam Again, Quickflight, Daniel Amos, Youth Choir (later renamed The Choir), Lifesavers Underground, Michael Knott, The Altar Boys, Breakfast with Amy, Steve Taylor, 4-4-1, David Edwards and Vector. 

Clive Barker<====>7573<====>Clive BarkerClive Barker (born 5 October 1952) is an English writer, film director, and visual artist.  Barker came to prominence in the mid-1980s with a series of short stories, the Books of Blood, which established him as a leading horror writer.  He has since written many novels and other works, and his fiction has been adapted into films, notably the Hellraiser and Candyman series.  He was also the executive producer of the film Gods and Monsters. Barker's paintings and illustrations have been featured in galleries in the United States as well as within his own books. 

Comic fantasy<====>7574<====>Comic fantasy Comic fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy that is primarily humorous in intent and tone.  Usually set in imaginary worlds, comic fantasy often includes puns on and parodies of other works of fantasy.  It is sometimes known as low fantasy in contrast to high fantasy, which is primarily serious in intent and tone.   The term "low fantasy" is used to represent other types of fantasy, however, so while comic fantasies may also correctly be classified as low fantasy, many examples of low fantasy are not comic in nature. LiteratureThe subgenre rose in the nineteenth century. 

CLU (programming language)<====>7575<====>CLU (programming language)  CLU is a  programming language created at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) by Barbara Liskov and her students between 1974 and 1975.  While it did not find extensive use, it introduced many features that are used widely now, and is seen as a step in the development of object-oriented programming (OOP). Key contributions include abstract data types,  call-by-sharing, iterators, multiple return values (a form of parallel assignment), type-safe parameterized types, and type-safe variant types.  It is also notable for its use of classes with constructors and methods, but without inheritance. ClustersThe syntax of CLU was based on ALGOL, then the starting point for most new language designs. 

History of the Soviet Union (1982–91)<====>7577<====>History of the Soviet Union (1982–91)   The history of the Soviet Union from 1982 through 1991 spans the period from Leonid Brezhnev's death and funeral until the dissolution of the Soviet Union.  Due to the years of Soviet military buildup at the expense of domestic development, economic growth stagnated.  Failed attempts at reform, a standstill economy, and the success of the United States against the Soviet Union's forces in the war in Afghanistan led to a general feeling of discontent, especially in the Baltic republics and Eastern Europe.  Greater political and social freedoms, instituted by the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, created an atmosphere of open criticism of the communist regime. 

Corsican language<====>7578<====>Corsican language Corsican (corsu or lingua corsa) is a Romance language within the Italo-Dalmatian subfamily.  It is closely related to the Italian language and especially to its Tuscan branch.  It is spoken and written on the islands of Corsica (France) and northern Sardinia (Italy).  Corsican used to play the role of a vernacular, while Italian was the official language in Corsica until 1859; afterwards Italian was replaced by French, owing to the acquisition of the island by France from the Republic of Genoa in 1768.  Over the next two centuries, the use of French grew to the extent that, by the Liberation in 1945, all islanders had a working knowledge of French. 

Commodore International<====>7580<====>Commodore International Commodore International (or Commodore International Limited) was an American home computer and electronics manufacturer founded by Jack Tramiel.  Commodore International (CI), along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM), participated in the development of the home–personal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s.  The company developed and marketed the world's best-selling desktop computer, the Commodore 64 (1982),    and released its Amiga computer line in July 1985.  With quarterly sales ending 1983 of $49 million, Commodore was one of the world's largest personal computer manufacturers.  HistoryFounding and early yearsThe company that would become Commodore Business Machines, Inc. 

Commodore (rank)<====>7581<====>Commodore (rank)  Commodore is a naval rank used in many navies that is superior to a navy captain, but below a rear admiral.  Non-English-speaking nations often use the rank of flotilla admiral or counter admiral or senior captain as an equivalent, although counter admiral may also correspond to rear admiral. Traditionally, "commodore" is the title for any officer assigned to command more than one ship at a time, even temporarily, much as "captain" is the traditional title for the commanding officer of a single ship even if the officer's official title in the service is a lower rank. 

Cauchy–Riemann equations<====>7583<====>Cauchy–Riemann equations In the field of complex analysis in mathematics, the Cauchy–Riemann equations, named after Augustin Cauchy and Bernhard Riemann, consist of a system of two partial differential equations which, together with certain continuity and differentiability criteria, form a necessary and sufficient condition for a complex function to be complex differentiable, that is, holomorphic.   This system of equations first appeared in the work of Jean le Rond d'Alembert  .  Later, Leonhard Euler connected this system to the analytic functions  .    then used these equations to construct his theory of functions.  Riemann's dissertation   on the theory of functions appeared in 1851. 

Chaim Topol<====>7585<====>Chaim Topol Chaim Topol ( , born September 9, 1935) , also spelled Haym Topol,  mononymously known as Topol,  is an Israeli theatrical, film, and television actor, singer, comedian, voice artist, film producer, author, and illustrator.  He is best known for his portrayal of Tevye the dairyman in the musical Fiddler on the Roof on stage and screen, a role he performed more than 3,500 times in shows and revivals from the late 1960s through 2009.Topol began his acting career during his Israeli army service in the Nahal entertainment troupe, and later toured Israel with kibbutz theatre and satirical theatre companies. 

Christadelphians<====>7586<====>Christadelphians   The Christadelphians ( ) are a millenarian Christian group who hold a view of Biblical Unitarianism.  There are approximately 50,000 Christadelphians in around 120 countries.   The movement developed in the United Kingdom and North America in the 19th century around the teachings of John Thomas, who coined the name Christadelphian "The Christadelphians, or brethren in Christ . . .  The very name 'Christadelphian' was coined by the founder of the movement, John Thomas, at the time of the American Civil War principally to provide a distinctive nomenclature for the use of the civil authorities [. 

Cable television<====>7587<====>Cable television  Cable television is a system of delivering television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables, or in more recent systems, light pulses through fiber-optic cables.  This contrasts with broadcast television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television; or satellite television, in which the television signal is transmitted by a communications satellite orbiting the Earth and received by a satellite dish on the roof.    FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone services, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables. 

Cholera<====>7591<====>Cholera    Cholera is an infection of the small intestine by some strains of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Symptoms may range from none, to mild, to severe.The classic symptom is large amounts of watery diarrhea that lasts a few days.   Vomiting and muscle cramps may also occur.   Diarrhea can be so severe that it leads within hours to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.   This may result in sunken eyes, cold skin, decreased skin elasticity, and wrinkling of the hands and feet.Dehydration can cause the skin to turn bluish. 

Caldera<====>7592<====>Caldera A caldera is a large cauldron-like depression that forms following the evacuation of a magma chamber/reservoir.  When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time, structural support for the crust above the magma chamber is lost.  The ground surface then collapses downward into the partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter).  Although sometimes described as a crater, the feature is actually a type of sinkhole, as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact.  Only seven known caldera-forming collapses have occurred since the start of the 20th century, most recently at Bárðarbunga volcano in Iceland. 

Calculator<====>7593<====>Calculator  An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics. The first solid state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s.  The pocket sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the first microprocessor, the Intel 4004, developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company Busicom.  They later became used commonly within the petroleum industry (oil and gas). Modern electronic calculators vary: from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers.  They became popular in the mid-1970s (as integrated circuits made their size and cost small). 

Cash register<====>7594<====>Cash register   A cash register, also referred to as a till in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries, is a mechanical or electronic device for registering and calculating transactions at a point of sale.   It is usually attached to a drawer for storing cash and other valuables.  The cash register is also usually attached to a printer, that can print out receipts for record keeping purposes. HistoryAn early mechanical cash register was invented by James Ritty and John Birch following the American Civil War.  James was the owner of a saloon in Dayton, Ohio, USA, and wanted to stop employees from pilfering his profits. 

Processor design<====>7597<====>Processor design Processor design is the design engineering task of creating a microprocessor, a component of computer hardware.  It is a subfield of computer engineering (design, development and implementation) and electronics engineering (fabrication).  The design process involves choosing an instruction set and a certain execution paradigm (e. g.  VLIW or RISC) and results in a microarchitecture described in e. g.  VHDL or Verilog.  This description is then manufactured employing some of the various semiconductor device fabrication processes.  This results in a die which is bonded onto a chip carrier.  This chip carrier is then soldered onto, or inserted into a socket on, a printed circuit board (PCB). 

Carinatae<====>7598<====>Carinatae Carinatae is the group of all birds and their extinct relatives to possess a keel, or "carina", on the underside of the breastbone used to anchor large flight muscles. ClassificationDefinitionTraditionally, Carinatae were defined as all birds whose sternum (breast bone) has a keel (carina).  The keel is a strong median ridge running down the length of the sternum.  This is an important area for the attachment of flight muscles.  Thus, all flying birds have a pronounced keel.  Ratites, all of whom are flightless, lack a strong keel.  Thus, living birds were divided into carinates (keeled) and ratites (from ratis, "raft", referring to the flatness of the sternum). 

Cocktail<====>7599<====>Cocktail When used to refer to any generic alcoholic mixed drink, cocktail may mean any beverage that contains two or more ingredients if at least one of those ingredients contains alcohol. Usage and related termsWhen a mixed drink contains only a distilled spirit and a mixer, such as soda  or fruit juice, it is a highball; many of the International Bartenders Association Official Cocktails are highballs.   When a cocktail contains only a distilled spirit and a liqueur, it is a duo and when it adds a mixer, it is a trio.  Additional ingredients may be sugar, honey, milk, cream, and  various herbs. 

Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria<====>7601<====>Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria   The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria (الكنيسة القبطية الارثوذكسية) is an Oriental Orthodox Christian church based in Egypt, Northeast Africa and the Middle East.   The head of the Church and the See of Alexandria is the Patriarch of Alexandria on the Holy See of Saint Mark, who also carries the title of Coptic Pope.  The See of Alexandria is titular, and today the Coptic Pope presides from Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in the Abbassia District in Cairo.  With 18–22 million members worldwide, whereof about 10 to 15 million are in Egypt (see Demographics section below), it is the country's largest Christian church. 

Family International<====>7602<====>Family International   The Family International (TFI) is a cult   that started in 1968 in Huntington Beach, California, USA.  It was originally called Teens for Christ and later gained notoriety as The Children of God (COG).  It was later renamed and reorganized as The Family of Love, which was eventually shortened to The Family.  It is currently called The Family International.  It is infamous for advocating incest with minor-age children, including by one of its leaders, Karen Zerby.  OverviewTFI initially spread a message of salvation, apocalypticism, spiritual "revolution and happiness" and distrust of the outside world, which the members called The System. 

Code of Hammurabi<====>7604<====>Code of Hammurabi  The Code of Hammurabi is a well-preserved Babylonian code of law of ancient Mesopotamia, dating back to about 1754 BC (Middle Chronology).   It is one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant length in the world.  The sixth Babylonian king, Hammurabi, enacted the code, and partial copies exist on a 2. 25 metre (7. 5 ft) stone stele and consists of 282 laws, with scaled punishments, adjusting "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" (lex talionis)  as graded depending on social status, of slave versus free man or woman. 

Rum and Coke<====>7605<====>Rum and Coke    Rum and Coke, or a Cuba Libre ( ;  , "Free Cuba" libre here an adjective, not a verb), is a highball cocktail consisting of cola, rum, and traditionally lime juice on ice. The cocktail originated in the early 20th century in Cuba, after the country won independence in the Spanish–American War.  It quickly became popular across Cuba and in many other countries, and has been one of the world's most popular alcoholic drinks.  Traditionally, the cola ingredient is Coca-Cola ("Coke"), and the alcohol is a Cuban light rum such as Bacardi. 

Collagen helix<====>7607<====>Collagen helix In collagen, the collagen helix, or type-2 helix, is a major shape in secondary structure.  It consists of a triple helix made of the repetitious amino acid sequence glycine - X - Y, where X and Y are frequently proline or hydroxyproline.A collagen triple helix has 3. 3 residues per turn.  Each of the three chains is stabilized by the steric repulsion due to the pyrrolidine rings of proline and hydroxyproline residues.  The pyrrolidine rings keep out of each other’s way when the polypeptide chain assumes this extended helical form, which is much more open than the tightly coiled form of the alpha helix. 

Cosmic censorship hypothesis<====>7609<====>Cosmic censorship hypothesisThe weak and the strong cosmic censorship hypotheses are two mathematical conjectures about the structure of singularities arising in general relativity. Singularities that arise in the solutions of Einstein's equations are typically hidden within event horizons, and therefore cannot be seen from the rest of spacetime.  Singularities that are not so hidden are called naked.  The weak cosmic censorship hypothesis was conceived by Roger Penrose in 1969 and posits that no naked singularities, other than the Big Bang singularity, exist in the universe. BasicsSince the physical behavior of singularities is unknown, if singularities can be observed from the rest of spacetime, causality may break down, and physics may lose its predictive power. 

Catholic (term)<====>7610<====>Catholic (term)   The word catholic (with lowercase c; derived via Late Latin catholicus, from the Greek adjective   (katholikos), meaning "universal"  ) comes from the Greek phrase   (katholou), meaning "on the whole", "according to the whole" or "in general", and is a combination of the Greek words   meaning "about" and   meaning "whole".    The term Catholic (usually written with uppercase C in English) was first used to describe the Christian Church in the early 2nd century to emphasize its universal scope.  In the context of Christian ecclesiology, it has a rich history and several usages. 

Crystal Eastman<====>7611<====>Crystal Eastman Crystal Catherine Eastman (June 25, 1881 – July 8, 1928)was an American lawyer, antimilitarist, feminist, socialist, and journalist.  She is best remembered as a leader in the fight for women's suffrage, as a co-founder and co-editor with her brother Max Eastman of the radical arts and politics magazine The Liberator, co-founder of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, and co-founder in 1920 of the American Civil Liberties Union.  In 2000 she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York. Early life and educationCrystal Eastman was born in Marlborough, Massachusetts, on June 25, 1881, the third of four children. 

Christopher Alexander<====>7612<====>Christopher Alexander    Christopher Wolfgang Alexander (born 4 October 1936 in Vienna, Austria)   is a widely influential architect and design theorist, and currently emeritus professor at the University of California, Berkeley.  His theories about the nature of human-centered design have affected fields beyond architecture, including urban design, software, sociology and others.Alexander has designed and personally built over 100 buildings, both as an architect and a general contractor.   In software, Alexander is regarded as the father of the pattern language movement.  The first wiki—the technology behind Wikipedia—led directly from Alexander's work, according to its creator, Ward Cunningham. 

Clabbers<====>7614<====>ClabbersClabbers is a game played by tournament Scrabble players for fun, or occasionally at Scrabble variant tournaments.   The name derives from the fact that the words CLABBERS and SCRABBLE form an anagram pair. RulesThe rules are identical to those of Scrabble, except that valid plays are only required to form anagrams of acceptable words; in other words, the letters in a word do not need to be placed in the correct order.  If a word is challenged, the player who played the word must then name an acceptable word that anagrams to the tiles played. Because the number of "words" that can be formed is vastly larger than in standard English, the board usually ends up tightly packed in places, and necessarily quite empty in others. 

Corum Jhaelen Irsei<====>7617<====>Corum Jhaelen Irsei Corum Jhaelen Irsei ("the Prince in the Scarlet Robe") is the name of a fictional fantasy hero in a series of two trilogies written by author Michael Moorcock. SynopsisCorum is the last survivor of the Vadhagh race and an incarnation aspect of the Eternal Champion, a being that exists in all worlds to ensure there is "Cosmic Balance". CollectionsThe Swords TrilogyThis trilogy consists of The Knight of the Swords (1971), The Queen of the Swords (1971), and The King of the Swords (1971).  In the United Kingdom it has been collected as an omnibus edition titled Corum, Swords of Corum and most recently Corum: The Prince in the Scarlet Robe (vol. 

Complex instruction set computer<====>7622<====>Complex instruction set computer Complex instruction set computing (CISC  ) is a processor design, where single  instructions can execute several low-level operations (such as a load from memory, an arithmetic operation, and a memory store) or are capable of multi-step operations or addressing modes within single instructions.  The term was retroactively coined in contrast to reduced instruction set computer (RISC)   and has therefore become something of an umbrella term for everything that is not RISC, from large and complex mainframe computers to simplistic microcontrollers where memory load and store operations are not separated from arithmetic instructions. 

Cetacea<====>7626<====>Cetacea Cetacea ( ) are a widely distributed and diverse clade of aquatic mammals that today consists of the whales, dolphins, and porpoises.  Cetaceans are carnivorous and finned.  Most species live in the sea, some in rivers.  The name is derived from the Latin cetus "whale", itself from the Greek  κῆτος kētos "huge fish".  There are around 89 extant species, which are divided into two groups or parvorders, the Odontoceti or toothed whales, a group of more than 70 species that includes the dolphins and porpoises, and the Mysticeti or baleen whales, of which there are now 15 species. 

The Canterbury Tales<====>7627<====>The Canterbury TalesThe Canterbury Tales (  ) is a collection of 24 stories that runs to over 17,000 lines written in Middle English by Geoffrey Chaucer between 1387 and 1400.   In 1386, Chaucer became Controller of Customs and Justice of Peace and, in 1389, Clerk of the King's work.   It was during these years that Chaucer began working on his most famous text, The Canterbury Tales.  The tales (mostly written in verse, although some are in prose) are presented as part of a story-telling contest by a group of pilgrims as they travel together on a journey from London to Canterbury to visit the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral. 

Christine de Pizan<====>7628<====>Christine de Pizan  Christine de Pizan (also seen as de Pisan;   ; 1364 – c.  1430) was an Italian French late medieval author.  Her most famous literary works are The Book of the City of Ladies and The Treasure of the City of Ladies.  She served as a court writer for several dukes (Louis of Orleans, Philip the Bold of Burgundy, and John the Fearless of Burgundy) and the French royal court during the reign of Charles VI.  She wrote both poetry and prose works such as biographies.  She completed forty-one works during her 30-year career from 1399 to 1429. 

Catharism<====>7630<====>Catharism   Catharism ( ; from the Greek:  , katharoi, "the pure [ones]")   was a Christian dualist or Gnostic revival  movement that thrived in some areas of Southern Europe, particularly northern Italy and what is now southern France, between the 12th and 14th centuries.  The followers were known as Cathars and are now mainly remembered for a prolonged period of persecution by the Catholic Church which did not recognise their belief as truly Christian.   Catharism appeared in Europe in the Languedoc region of France in the 11th century and this is when the name first appears. 

Cerebrospinal fluid<====>7632<====>Cerebrospinal fluid   Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless body fluid found in the brain and spinal cord.  It is produced in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations.  There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day.  CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull.  The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow. The CSF occupies the subarachnoid space (between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater) and the ventricular system around and inside the brain and spinal cord. 

Charles F. Hockett<====>7635<====>Charles F.  Hockett  Charles Francis Hockett (January 17, 1916 – November 3, 2000) was an American linguist who developed many influential ideas in American structuralist linguistics.  He represents the post-Bloomfieldian phase of structuralism often referred to as "distributionalism" or "taxonomic structuralism".  His academic career spanned over half a century at Cornell and Rice universities. Professional and academic careerEducationAt the age of 16, Hockett enrolled at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio where he received a Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in ancient history.  While enrolled at Ohio State, Hockett became interested in the work of Leonard Bloomfield, a leading figure in the field of structural linguistics. 

Consilience<====>7638<====>Consilience In science and history, consilience (also convergence of evidence or concordance of evidence) refers to the principle that evidence from independent, unrelated sources can "converge" to strong conclusions.  That is, when multiple sources of evidence are in agreement, the conclusion can be very strong even when none of the individual sources of evidence is significantly so on its own.  Most established scientific knowledge is supported by a convergence of evidence: if not, the evidence is comparatively weak, and there will not likely be a strong scientific consensus. The principle is based on the unity of knowledge; measuring the same result by several different methods should lead to the same answer. 

Clarence Brown<====>7642<====>Clarence Brown  Clarence Leon Brown (May 10, 1890 – August 17, 1987) was an American film director. Early lifeBorn in Clinton, Massachusetts, the son of Larkin Harry Brown (1866-1942) a cotton manufacturer and Katherine Ann Brown (née Gaw) (1865-1954), Brown moved to Tennessee when he was 11 years old.  He attended Knoxville High School  and the University of Tennessee, both in Knoxville, Tennessee, graduating from the university at the age of 19 with two degrees in engineering.   An early fascination in automobiles led Brown to a job with the Stevens-Duryea Company, then to his own Brown Motor Car Company in Alabama. 

Conciliation<====>7643<====>Conciliation    Conciliation is an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process whereby the parties to a dispute use a conciliator, who meets with the parties both separately and together in an attempt to resolve their differences.  They do this by lowering tensions, improving communications, interpreting issues, encouraging parties to explore potential solutions and assisting parties in finding a mutually acceptable outcome. Conciliation differs from arbitration in that the conciliation process, in and of itself, has no legal standing, and the conciliator usually has no authority to seek evidence or call witnesses, usually writes no decision, and makes no award. 

Cyclone (programming language)<====>7645<====>Cyclone (programming language) The Cyclone programming language is intended to be a safe dialect of the C language. Cyclone is designed to avoid buffer overflows and other vulnerabilities that are endemic in C programs, without losing the power and convenience of C as a tool for system programming.Cyclone development was started as a joint project of AT&T Labs Research and Greg Morrisett's group at Cornell in 2001. Version 1.0 was released on May 8, 2006.Language featuresCyclone attempts to avoid some of the common pitfalls of C, while still maintaining its look and performance. To this end, Cyclone places the following limits on programs: NULL  checks are inserted to prevent segmentation faultsPointer arithmetic is limitedPointers must be initialized before use (this is enforced by definite assignment analysis)Dangling pointers are prevented through region analysis and limits on  free() Only "safe" casts and unions are allowed goto  into scopes is disallowed switch  labels in different scopes are disallowedPointer-returning functions must execute  return  setjmp  and  longjmp  are not supportedTo maintain the tool set that C programmers are used to, Cyclone provides the following extensions:Never- NULL  pointers do not require  NULL  checks"Fat" pointers support pointer arithmetic with run-time bounds checkingGrowable regions support a form of safe manual memory managementGarbage collection for heap-allocated valuesTagged unions support type-varying argumentsInjections help automate the use of tagged unions for programmersPolymorphism replaces some uses of  void * varargs are implemented as fat pointersExceptions replace some uses of  setjmp  and  longjmp For a better high-level introduction to Cyclone, the reasoning behind Cyclone and the source of these lists, see this paper.Cyclone looks, in general, much like C, but it should be viewed as a C-like language.Pointer typesCyclone implements three kinds of pointer: *  (the normal type) @  (the never- NULL  pointer), and ?  (the only type with pointer arithmetic allowed, "fat" pointers).The purpose of introducing these new pointer types is to avoid common problems when using pointers. Take for instance a function, called  foo  that takes a pointer to an int: int foo(int *); Although the person who wrote the function  foo  could have inserted  NULL  checks, let us assume that for performance reasons they did not. Calling  foo(NULL);  will result in undefined behavior (typically, although not necessarily, a SIGSEGV signal being sent to the application). To avoid such problems, Cyclone introduces the  @  pointer type, which can never be  NULL . Thus, the "safe" version of  foo  would be: int foo(int @); This tells the Cyclone compiler that the argument to  foo  should never be  NULL , avoiding the aforementioned undefined behavior. The simple change of  *  to  @  saves the programmer from having to write  NULL  checks and the operating system from having to trap  NULL  pointer dereferences.  This extra limit, however, can be a rather large stumbling block for most C programmers, who are used to being able to manipulate their pointers directly with arithmetic. Although this is desirable, it can lead to buffer overflows and other "off-by-one"-style mistakes. To avoid this, the  ?  pointer type is delimited by a known bound, the size of the array. Although this adds overhead due to the extra information stored about the pointer, it improves safety and security. Take for instance a simple (and naïve)  strlen  function, written in C: int strlen(const char *s){    int iter = 0;    if (s == NULL)  return 0;    while (s[iter] != '\0') {  iter++;    }    return iter;} This function assumes that the string being passed in is terminated by NULL ( '\0' ). However, what would happen if  char buf[] = {'h','e','l','l','o','!'};  were passed to this string? This is perfectly legal in C, yet would cause  strlen  to iterate through memory not necessarily associated with the string  s . There are functions, such as  strnlen  which can be used to avoid such problems, but these functions are not standard with every implementation of ANSI C. The Cyclone version of  strlen  is not so different from the C version: int strlen(const char ? s){   int iter, n = s.size;   if (s == NULL) return 0;   for (iter = 0; iter  Here,  strlen  bounds itself by the length of the array passed to it, thus not going over the actual length. Each of the kinds of pointer type can be safely cast to each of the others, and arrays and strings are automatically cast to  ?  by the compiler. (Casting from  ?  to  *  invokes a bounds check, and casting from  ?  to  @  invokes both a  NULL  check and a bounds check. Casting from  *  or  ?  results in no checks whatsoever; the resulting  ?  pointer has a size of 1.)Dangling pointers and region analysisConsider the following code, in C: char *itoa(int i){   char buf[20];   sprintf(buf,"%d",i);   return buf;} Function  itoa  allocates an array of chars  buf  on the stack and returns a pointer to the start of  buf . However the memory used on the stack for  buf  is deallocated when the function returns, so the returned value cannot be used safely outside of the function. While gcc and other compilers will warn about such code, the following will typically compile without warnings: char *itoa(int i){   char buf[20], *z;   sprintf(buf,"%d",i);   z = buf;   return z;} gcc can produce warnings for such code as a side-effect of option -O2 or -O3, but there are no guarantees that all such errors will be detected.Cyclone does regional analysis of each segment of code, preventing dangling pointers, such as the one returned from this version of  itoa . All of the local variables in a given scope are considered to be part of the same region, separate from the heap or any other local region. Thus, when analyzing  itoa , the Cyclone compiler would see that  z  is a pointer into the local stack, and would report an error.See alsoCMLRustReferences Cyclone User ManualCyclone: a Type-safe Dialect of C by Dan Grossman, Michael Hicks, Trevor Jim, and Greg Morrisett - published January 2005External linksCyclone HomepageOld web site since official web site is not available.Cyclone 1.0 source code RPM Cyclone - Source code repositoriesCyclone - FAQCyclone for C programmersPresentations:Cyclone:  A Type-Safe Dialect of CCyclone: A Memory-Safe C-Level Programming Language DEFAULTSORT

Counter (digital)<====>7647<====>Counter (digital) A counter circuit is usually constructed of a number of flip-flops connected in cascade.  Counters are a very widely used component in digital circuits, and are manufactured as separate integrated circuits and  also incorporated as parts of larger integrated circuits. Electronic countersIn electronics, counters can be implemented quite easily using register-type circuits such as the flip-flop, and a wide variety of classified  into:Asynchronous (ripple) counter – changing state bits are used as clocks to subsequent state flip-flopsSynchronous counter – all state bits change under control of a single clockDecade counter – counts through ten states per stageUp/down counter – counts both up and down, under command of a control inputRing counter – formed by a shift register with feedback connection in a ringJohnson counter – a twisted ring counterCascaded counterModulus counter.

CMI's scientific activities are managed from the President's office in Oxford, United Kingdom.  The institute is "dedicated to increasing and disseminating mathematical knowledge. " It gives out various awards and sponsorships to promising mathematicians.  The institute was founded in 1998 through the sponsorship of Boston businessman Landon T.  Clay.  Harvard mathematician Arthur Jaffe was the first president of CMI.  While the institute is best known for its Millennium Prize Problems, it carries out a wide range of activities, including a postdoctoral program (ten Clay Research Fellows are supported currently), conferences, workshops, and summer schools. 

Cerebral arteriovenous malformation<====>7659<====>Cerebral arteriovenous malformation A cerebral arteriovenous malformation (cerebral AVM, CAVM, cAVM) is an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in the brain—specifically, an arteriovenous malformation in the cerebrum. Signs and symptomsThe most frequently observed problems, related to an AVM, are headaches and seizures, backaches, neckaches and eventual nausea, as the coagulated blood makes its way down to be dissolved in the individual's spinal fluid.  It is supposed that 15% of the population, at detection, have no symptoms at all.   Other common symptoms are a pulsing noise in the head, progressive weakness and numbness and vision changes as well as debilitating, excruciating pain. 

Comparative method (linguistics)<====>7660<====>Comparative method (linguistics) In linguistics, the comparative method is a technique for studying the development of languages by performing a feature-by-feature comparison of two or more languages with common descent from a shared ancestor, in order to extrapolate back to infer the properties of that ancestor.  The comparative method may be contrasted with the method of internal reconstruction, in which the internal development of a single language is inferred by the analysis of features within that language.   Ordinarily both methods are used together to reconstruct prehistoric phases of languages, to fill in gaps in the historical record of a language, to discover the development of phonological, morphological, and other linguistic systems, and to confirm or refute hypothesised relationships between languages. 

Council of Constance<====>7661<====>Council of Constance   The Council of Constance is the 15th-century ecumenical council recognized by the Catholic Church, held from 1414 to 1418 in the Bishopric of Constance.  The council ended the Western Schism, by deposing or accepting the resignation of the remaining papal claimants and electing Pope Martin V. The council also condemned Jan Hus as a heretic and facilitated his execution by the civil authority.  It also ruled on issues of national sovereignty, the rights of pagans, and just war in response to a conflict between the Kingdom of Poland and the Order of the Teutonic Knights. 

Churches Uniting in Christ<====>7662<====>Churches Uniting in Christ Churches Uniting in Christ (CUIC) is an ecumenical organization that brings together ten mainline American denominations (including both predominantly white and predominantly black churches), and was inaugurated on January 20, 2002 in Memphis, Tennessee on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel.   It is the successor organization to the Consultation on Church Union. HistoryOriginsCUIC is the successor organization to the Consultation on Church Union (COCU), which had been founded in 1962.  The original task of COCU was to negotiate a consensus  between its nine (originally four) member communions (it also included three "advisory participant" churches). 

Canadian Unitarian Council<====>7663<====>Canadian Unitarian Council  Canadian Unitarian Council ( ) (CUC) formed on May 14, 1961 to be the national organization for Canadians who belong to the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) (the UUA formed a day later, on May 15, 1961).  Until 2002, almost all member   of the CUC were also members of the UUA, and most services to CUC member congregations were provided by the UUA.  However, after an agreement between the CUC and the UUA, most services since 2002 have been provided by the CUC to its own member congregations, with the UUA continuing to provide ministerial settlement services. 

Charles Mingus<====>7668<====>Charles Mingus  Charles Mingus Jr.  (April 22, 1922 – January 5, 1979) was an American jazz double bassist, pianist, composer and bandleader.  His compositions retained the hot and soulful feel of hard bop, drawing heavily from black gospel music and blues, while sometimes containing elements of Third Stream, free jazz, and classical music.  He once cited Duke Ellington and church as his main influences. Mingus espoused collective improvisation, similar to the old New Orleans jazz parades, paying particular attention to how each band member interacted with the group as a whole.  In creating his bands, he looked not only at the skills of the available musicians, but also their personalities. 

Centimetre<====>7669<====>Centimetre   A centimetre (international spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures; symbol cm) or centimeter (American spelling) is a unit of length in the metric system, equal to one hundredth of a metre, centi being the SI prefix for a factor of  .   The centimetre was the base unit of length in the now deprecated centimetre–gram–second (CGS) system of units. Though for many physical quantities, SI prefixes for factors of 10 3 —like milli- and kilo-—are often preferred by technicians, the centimetre remains a practical unit of length for many everyday measurements.

Committee on Data for Science and Technology<====>7671<====>Committee on Data for Science and Technology    The Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) was established in 1966 as an interdisciplinary committee of the International Council for Science.  It seeks to improve the compilation, critical evaluation, storage, and retrieval of data of importance to science and technology. CODATA sponsors the CODATA international conference  every two years.   Task Group on Fundamental Constants CODATA is best known for (and sometimes confused with) its Task Group on Fundamental Constants (TGFC).   Established in 1969, its purpose is to periodically provide the international scientific and technological communities with an internationally accepted set of values of the fundamental physical constants and closely related conversion factors for use worldwide. 

Chuck Jones<====>7672<====>Chuck Jones  Charles Martin "Chuck" Jones (September 21, 1912 – February 22, 2002) was an American animator, filmmaker, cartoonist, author, artist, and screenwriter, best known for his work with Warner Bros.  Cartoons on the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts.  He wrote, produced, and/or directed many classic animated cartoon shorts starring Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Wile E.  Coyote and the Road Runner, Pepé Le Pew, Porky Pig, Michigan J.  Frog, the Three Bears, and a slew of other Warner characters. After his career at Warner Bros.  ended in 1962, Jones started Sib Tower 12 Productions, and began producing cartoons for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, including a new series of Tom and Jerry shorts and the television adaptation of Dr. 

Costume<====>7673<====>Costume Costume is the distinctive style of dress of an individual or group that reflects their class, gender, profession, ethnicity, nationality, activity or epoch. The term also was traditionally used to describe typical appropriate clothing for certain activities, such as riding costume, swimming costume, dance costume, and  evening costume.   Appropriate and acceptable costume is subject to changes in fashion and local cultural norms.   This general usage has gradually been replaced by the terms "dress", "attire" or "wear" and usage of "costume" has become more limited to unusual or out-of-date clothing and to attire intended to evoke a change in identity, such as theatrical, Halloween, and mascot costumes. 

Cable car (railway)<====>7674<====>Cable car (railway) A cable car (cable tram elsewhere, apart from North America) is a type of cable transportation used for mass transit where rail cars are hauled by a continuously moving cable running at a constant speed.  Individual cars stop and start by releasing and gripping this cable as required.  Cable cars are distinct from funiculars, where the cars are permanently attached to the cable, and cable railways, which are similar to funiculars, but where the rail vehicles are attached and detached manuallyHistoryThe first cable-operated railway, employing a moving rope that could be picked up or released by a grip on the cars wasthe Fawdon railway (or wagonway) in 1826, a Colliery railway line. 

Creaky voice<====>7676<====>Creaky voice In linguistics, creaky voice (sometimes called laryngealisation, pulse phonation, vocal fry, or glottal fry) is a special kind of phonation   in which the arytenoid cartilages in the larynx are drawn together; as a result, the vocal folds are compressed rather tightly, becoming relatively slack and compact.  They normally vibrate irregularly at 20–50 pulses per second, about two octaves below the frequency of normal voicing, and the airflow through the glottis is very slow.  Although creaky voice may occur with very low pitch, as at the end of a long intonation unit, it can also occur with a higher pitch. 

Computer monitor<====>7677<====>Computer monitorA computer monitor is an output device which displays information in pictorial form.  A monitor usually comprises the display device, circuitry, casing, and power supply.  The display device in modern monitors is typically a thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) with LED backlighting having replaced cold-cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlighting.  Older monitors used a cathode ray tube (CRT).  Monitors are connected to the computer via VGA, Digital Visual Interface (DVI), HDMI, DisplayPort, Thunderbolt, low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) or other proprietary connectors and signals. Originally, computer monitors were used for data processing while television receivers were used for entertainment. 

ClearType<====>7681<====>ClearType ClearType is  Microsoft's implementation of subpixel rendering technology in rendering text in a font system.  ClearType attempts to improve the appearance of text on certain types of computer display screens by sacrificing color fidelity for additional intensity variation.  This trade-off is asserted to work well on LCD flat panel monitors. ClearType was first announced at the November 1998 COMDEX exhibition.  The technology was first introduced in software in January 2000  as an always-on feature of Microsoft Reader, which was released to the public in August 2000. ClearType was significantly changed with the introduction of DirectWrite in Windows 7. 

Centriole<====>7682<====>Centriole   In cell biology a centriole is a cylindrical cell structure    composed mainly of a protein called tubulin that is found in most eukaryotic cells.  An associated pair of centrioles, surrounded by a shapeless mass of dense material, called the pericentriolar material, or PCM, makes up a compound structure called a centrosome.  Centrioles are present in the cells of most eukaryotes, for example those of animals.  However, they are absent from conifers (pinophyta), flowering plants (angiosperms) and most fungi, and are only present in the male gametes of charophytes, bryophytes, seedless vascular plants, cycads, and ginkgo. 

Creation science<====>7683<====>Creation science   Creation science or scientific creationism  is a branch of creationism that claims to provide scientific support for the Genesis creation narrative in the Book of Genesis and disprove or reexplain the scientific facts,  theories and scientific paradigms about geology,cosmology, biological evolution,   archeology,   history, and linguistics.  The overwhelming consensus of the scientific community is that creation science is a religious, not a scientific, view.  It fails to qualify as a science because it lacks empirical support, supplies no tentative hypotheses, and resolves to describe natural history in terms of scientifically untestable supernatural causes.

Cirth<====>7689<====>Cirth  The Cirth ( ; plural of certh  , in Sindarin meaning runes) are a semi-artificial script, with letters shaped on those of actual runic alphabets, invented by J.  R.  R.  Tolkien for the constructed languages he devised and used in his works.  Cirth is written with a capital letter when referring to the writing system; the runes themselves can be called cirth. In the fictional history of Middle-earth, the original Certhas Daeron was created by the elf Daeron, and was later expanded into what was known as the Angerthas Daeron.  Although the Cirth were later largely replaced by the Tengwar, they were adopted by Dwarves to write down their Khuzdul language (Angerthas Moria and Angerthas Erebor) because their straight lines were better suited to carving than the curved strokes of the Tengwar. 

Lockheed C-130 Hercules<====>7697<====>Lockheed C-130 Hercules  The Lockheed C-130 Hercules is a four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft designed and built originally by Lockheed (now Lockheed Martin).  Capable of using unprepared runways for takeoffs and landings, the C-130 was originally designed as a troop, medevac, and cargo transport aircraft.  The versatile airframe has found uses in a variety of other roles, including as a gunship (AC-130), for airborne assault, search and rescue, scientific research support, weather reconnaissance, aerial refueling, maritime patrol, and aerial firefighting.  It is now the main tactical airlifter for many military forces worldwide.  Over forty variants and versions of the Hercules, including a civilian one marketed as the Lockheed L-100, operate in more than 60 nations. 

Commodore 1570<====>7699<====>Commodore 1570  The Commodore 1570 is a 5¼" floppy disk drive for the Commodore 128 home/personal computer.  It is a single-sided, 170 kB version of the Commodore 1571, released as a stopgap measure when Commodore International was unable to provide large enough quantities of 1571s due to a shortage of double-sided drive mechanisms (supplied from an outside manufacturer).  Like the 1571, it can read and write both GCR and MFM disk formats. The 1570 utilizes a 1571 logic board in a cream-colored original-1541-like case with a drive mechanism similar to the 1541's except that it was equipped with track-zero detection. 

Commodore 1571<====>7700<====>Commodore 1571  The Commodore 1571 is Commodore's high-end 5¼" floppy disk drive.  With its double-sided drive mechanism, it has the ability to use double-sided, double-density (DS/DD) floppy disks natively.  This is in contrast to its predecessors, the 1541 and 1570, which can fully read and write such disks only if the user manually flipped them over to access the second side.  Because flipping the disk also reverses the direction of rotation, the two methods are not interchangeable; disks which had their back side created in a 1541 by flipping them over would have to be flipped in the 1571 too, and the back side of disks written in a 1571 using the native support for two-sided operation could not be read in a 1541. 

Cocaine<====>7701<====>Cocaine  Cocaine, also known as coke, is a strong stimulant mostly used as a recreational drug.It is commonly snorted, inhaled as smoke, or as a solution injected into a vein.   Mental effects may include loss of contact with reality, an intense feeling of happiness, or agitation.   Physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and large pupils.High doses can result in very high blood pressure or body temperature.   Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes. 

Cartesian coordinate system<====>7706<====>Cartesian coordinate system  A Cartesian coordinate system is a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a pair of numerical coordinates, which are the signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular directed lines, measured in the same unit of length.  Each reference line is called a coordinate axis or just axis (plural axes) of the system, and the point where they meet is its origin, at ordered pair  .  The coordinates can also be defined as the positions of the perpendicular projections of the point onto the two axes, expressed as signed distances from the origin.

Joint Chiefs of Staff: composition; functions.   The CMC reports directly to the United States Secretary of the Navy and is responsible for ensuring the organization, policy, plans, and programs for the Marine Corps as well as advising the President, the Secretary of Defense, the National Security Council,  the Homeland Security Council,  and the Secretary of the Navy on matters involving the Marine Corps. 

California Department of Transportation<====>7710<====>California Department of Transportation  The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) is an executive department within the U. S.  state of California. Caltrans manages the state highway system (which includes the California Freeway and Expressway System) and is involved with public transportation systems throughout the state.  It supports Amtrak California and the Capitol Corridor. The department is part of the state cabinet-level California State Transportation Agency (CalSTA). Like the majority of state government agencies, Caltrans is headquartered in Sacramento.  In 2015, Caltrans released a new mission statement: "Provide a safe, sustainable, integrated and efficient transportation system to enhance California’s economy and livability. 

Continuation War<====>7712<====>Continuation War   The Continuation War ( ;  ; 25 June 1941 – 19 September 1944) consisted of hostilities between Finland and the Soviet Union from 1941 to 1944.  The Continuation War began 15 months after the end of the Winter War, which was also fought between Finland and the Soviet Union.In the Soviet Union, the war was considered part of the Great Patriotic War.  Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Finland, Moscow, 1974.Germany regarded its operations in the region as part of its overall war efforts on the Eastern Front, and it provided Finland with critical material support and military cooperation. 

Chinese remainder theorem<====>7713<====>Chinese remainder theoremThe Chinese remainder theorem is a theorem of number theory, which states that if one knows the remainders of the Euclidean division of an integer   by several integers, then one can determine uniquely the remainder of the division of   by the product of these integers, under the condition that the divisors are pairwise coprime. The theorem was first discovered in the 3rd century AD by the Chinese mathematician Sunzi in Sunzi Suanjing. The Chinese remainder theorem is widely used for computing with large integers, as it allows replacing a computation for which one knows a bound on the size of the result by several similar computations on small integers. 

Cyril M. Kornbluth<====>7716<====>Cyril M.  Kornbluth   Cyril M.  Kornbluth (July 2, 1923  – March 21, 1958) was an American science fiction author and a member of the Futurians.  He used a variety of pen-names, including Cecil Corwin, S.  D.  Gottesman, Edward J.  Bellin, Kenneth Falconer, Walter C.  Davies, Simon Eisner, Jordan Park, Arthur Cooke, Paul Dennis Lavond and Scott Mariner.The "M" in Kornbluth's name may have been in tribute to his wife, Mary Byers;  Kornbluth's colleague and collaborator Frederik Pohl confirmed Kornbluth's lack of any actual middle name in at least one interview. 

Coprophagia<====>7720<====>Coprophagia  Coprophagia ( )  or coprophagy ( ) is the consumption of feces.  The word is derived from the Greek κόπρος copros, "feces" and φαγεῖν phagein, "to eat".  Coprophagy refers to many kinds of feces-eating, including eating feces of other species (heterospecifics), of other individuals (allocoprophagy), or one's own (autocoprophagy) – those once deposited or taken directly from the anus.  In humans, coprophagia has been observed in individuals with mental illnesses, as well as as an unconventional sexual act.  Some animal species eat feces as a normal behavior, in particular in the Lagomorpha (rabbits, hares, and pikas) doing so to allow tough plant materials to be digested more efficiently by passing twice through the digestive tract. 

C. L. Moore<====>7721<====>C.  L.  Moore  Catherine Lucille Moore (January 24, 1911 – April 4, 1987) was an American science fiction and fantasy writer, who most often used the pen name C.  L.  Moore.  She was among the first women to write in either genre (though earlier woman writers in these genres include Sophie Wenzel Ellis, Clare Winger Harris, Lilith Lorraine, Greye La Spina, Francis Stevens, Leslie F.  Stone, and Everil Worrell).  Moore's work paved the way for many other female speculative fiction writers.  She and her first husband Henry Kuttner were prolific co-authors under their own names and three pseudonyms. 

Compactron<====>7722<====>CompactronCompactrons are a type of thermionic valve, or  vacuum tube, which contain arrangements of diodes, triodes, or pentodes in multiple combination arrays, as well as high or low-voltage and power types.  The are, in effect, multiple tubes packed into a single body. HistoryThe Compactron is a 12-pin Duodecar base vacuum tube family introduced in 1961 by General Electric in Owensboro, Kentucky   to compete with transistorized electronics during the solid state transition.Television sets were a primary application. Use was prevalent in televisions because transistors were slow to achieve the high power and frequency capabilities needed particularly in color television sets. 

Carmichael number<====>7723<====>Carmichael numberIn number theory, a Carmichael number is a composite number  n  which satisfies the modular arithmetic congruence relation: b^{n-1}\equiv 1\pmod{n} for all integers  b  which are relatively prime to  n .  They are named for Robert Carmichael. The Carmichael numbers are the subset K 1  of the Knödel numbers. Equivalently, a Carmichael number is a composite number  n  for which b^n\equiv b\pmod{n} for all integers  b .  OverviewFermat's little theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer b, the number b  p  − b is an integer multiple of p. 

Controlled Substances Act<====>7727<====>Controlled Substances Act The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) is the statute establishing federal U. S.  drug policy under which the manufacture, importation, possession, use and distribution of certain substances is regulated.  It was passed by the 91st United States Congress as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 and signed into law by President Richard Nixon.   The Act also served as the national implementing legislation for the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. The legislation created five Schedules (classifications), with varying qualifications for a substance to be included in each.  Two federal agencies, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), determine which substances are added to or removed from the various schedules, although the statute passed by Congress created the initial listing.

Christian countercult movement<====>7731<====>Christian countercult movement  The Christian countercult movement or Christian anti-cult movement is a social movement of certain  Protestant evangelical and fundamentalist  and other Christian ministries ("discernment ministries" ) and individual activists who oppose religious sects they consider "cults".  OverviewChristian countercult activism stems mainly from evangelicalism or fundamentalism.  The countercult movement asserts that particular Christian sects whose beliefs they deem to be partially or wholly not in accordance with the Bible are erroneous.  It also states that a religious sect can be considered a cult if its beliefs involve a denial of what they view as any of the essential Christian teachings such as salvation, the Trinity,  Jesus himself as a person, the ministry and miracles of Jesus, his crucifixion, his resurrection, the Second Coming and the Rapture.

Central Pacific Railroad<====>7734<====>Central Pacific Railroad  The Central Pacific Railroad (CPRR) was a rail route between California and Utah built eastwards from the West Coast in the 1860s, to complete the western part of the "First Transcontinental Railroad" in North America.  It later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. Many 19th century national proposals to build a transcontinental railroad failed because of the energy consumed by political disputes over slavery.  With the secession of the South, the modernizers in the Republican Party controlled the US Congress.  They passed legislation authorizing the railroad, with financing in the form of government railroad bonds. 

Clairvoyance<====>7737<====>Clairvoyance   Clairvoyance (/klɛɹˈvɔɪəns/ or /klɛəˈvɔɪəns/) (from French clair meaning "clear" and voyance meaning "vision") is the alleged ability to gain information about an object, person, location, or physical event through extrasensory perception.    Any person who is claimed to have some such ability is said accordingly to be a clairvoyant (/klerˈvɔɪənt/)  ("one who sees clearly"). Claims for the existence of paranormal and psychic abilities such as clairvoyance have not been supported by scientific evidence published in high impact factor peer reviewed journals.  Carroll, Robert Todd.  (2003).  "Clairvoyance".  Retrieved 2014-04-30.   Parapsychology explores this possibility, but the existence of the paranormal is not accepted by the scientific community. 

Chiropractic<====>7738<====>Chiropractic   Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine mostly concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, especially the spine. Proponents claim that such disorders affect general health via the nervous system.These claims are not backed by any evidence.  The main chiropractic treatment technique involves manual therapy, especially spinal manipulation therapy (SMT), manipulations of other joints and soft tissues.    AHCPR Pub No.  98-N002.   Its foundation is at odds with mainstream medicine, and chiropractic is sustained by pseudoscientific ideas such as subluxation and "innate intelligence" that are not based on sound science. 

Carbide<====>7739<====>Carbide In chemistry, a carbide is a compound composed of carbon and a less electronegative element.   Carbides can be generally classified by the chemical bonds type as follows: (i) salt-like, (ii) covalent compounds, (iii) interstitial compounds, and (iv) "intermediate" transition metal carbides.  Examples include calcium carbide (CaC 2 ), silicon carbide (SiC), tungsten carbide (WC) (often called simply carbide when referring to machine tooling), and cementite (Fe 3 C),    each used in key industrial applications.  The naming of ionic carbides is not systematic. Salt-like (saline) carbidesSalt-like carbides are composed of highly electropositive elements such as the alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and group 3 metals, including scandium, yttrium, and lanthanum.

Crete senesi are literally ‘Senese clays’, and the distinctive grey colouration of the soil gives the landscape an appearance often described as lunar.  This characteristic clay, known as mattaione, represents the sediments of the Pliocene sea which covered the area between 2. 5 and 4. 5 million years ago. 

Christmas tree<====>7770<====>Christmas tree  A Christmas tree is a decorated tree, usually an evergreen conifer such as spruce, pine, or fir or an artificial tree of similar appearance, associated with the celebration of Christmas.  The modern Christmas tree was developed in medieval Livonia (present-day Estonia and Latvia) and early modern Germany, where devout Christians brought decorated trees into their homes.  It acquired popularity beyond the Lutheran areas of Germanyand the Baltic countries during the second half of the 19th century, at first among the upper classes.    The tree was traditionally decorated with "roses made of colored paper, apples, wafers, tinsel, [and] sweetmeats". 

Carrier battle group<====>7772<====>Carrier battle group   A carrier battle group (CVBG) consists of an aircraft carrier (designated CV) and its large number of escorts, together defining the group.  The first naval task forces built around carriers appeared just prior to and during World War II.  The Imperial Japanese Navy, IJN, was the first to assemble a large number of carriers into a single task force, known as Kido Butai.  This task force was used with devastating effect in the Imperial Japanese Navy's Attack on Pearl Harbor.  Kido Butai operated as the IJN's main carrier battle group until four of its carriers were sunk at the Battle of Midway.

Chianti<====>7781<====>Chianti A Chianti wine ( ) is any wine produced in the Chianti region, in central Tuscany, Italy.  It was historically associated with a squat bottle enclosed in a straw basket, called a fiasco ("flask"; pl.  fiaschi).  However, the fiasco is only used by a few makers of the wine as most Chianti is now bottled in more standard shaped wine bottles.  Baron Bettino Ricasoli (later Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Italy) created the Chianti recipe of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Canaiolo and 15% Malvasia bianca in the middle of the 19th century.  J.  Robinson (ed) "The Oxford Companion to Wine" Third Edition  pg 162-163 Oxford University Press 2006   The first definition of a wine-area called Chianti was made in 1716. 

Coriolis force<====>7783<====>Coriolis force In physics, the Coriolis force is an inertial force  that acts on objects that are in motion relative to a rotating reference frame.  In a reference frame with clockwise rotation, the force acts to the left of the motion of the object.  In one with anticlockwise rotation, the force acts to the right.  Deflection of an object due to the Coriolis force is called the Coriolis effect.  Though recognized previously by others, the mathematical expression for the Coriolis force appeared in an 1835 paper by French scientist Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis, in connection with the theory of water wheels. 

Challenger Deep<====>7786<====>Challenger Deep The Challenger Deep is the deepest known point in the Earth's seabed hydrosphere, with a depth of   by direct measurement from submersibles, and slightly more by sonar bathymetry.  It is in the Pacific Ocean, at the southern end of the Mariana Trench near the Mariana Islands group.  The Challenger Deep is a relatively small slot-shaped depression in the bottom of a considerably larger crescent-shaped oceanic trench, which itself is an unusually deep feature in the ocean floor.  Its bottom is about   long and   wide, with gently sloping sides.   The closest land to the Challenger Deep is Fais Island (one of the outer islands of Yap),   southwest, and Guam,   to the northeast.

On a practical basis, Berthollet was the first to demonstrate the bleaching action of chlorine gas, and was first to develop a solution of sodium hypochlorite as a modern bleaching agent. BiographyClaude Louis Berthollet was born in  Talloires, near Annecy, then part of the Duchy of Savoy, in 1749. 

Constitution of Chile<====>7791<====>Constitution of Chile  The current Political Constitution of the Republic of Chile, approved by Chilean voters in a controversial plebiscite on September 11, 1980, under the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, partially effective March 11, 1981, fully effective 11 March 1990 and amended considerably on August 17, 1989 (via referendum) and on September 22, 2005 (legislatively), and also in 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, replaced the earlier constitution of 1925.  It is Chile's eighth constitution.  Legitimacy According to law professor, Camel Cazor Aliste, the Constitution of 1980 has problems of legitimacy stemming from two facts: First, the writing commission was not representative of the political spectrum of Chile. 

Crystallography<====>7794<====>Crystallography  Crystallography is the experimental science of determining the arrangement of atoms in crystalline solids (see crystal structure).  The word "crystallography" derives from the Greek words crystallon "cold drop, frozen drop", with its meaning extending to all solids with some degree of transparency, and graphein "to write".   In July 2012, the United Nations recognised the importance of the science of crystallography by proclaiming that 2014 would be the International Year of Crystallography.

Critical psychology<====>7801<====>Critical psychology Critical psychology is a perspective on psychology that draws extensively on critical theory.  Critical psychology challenges mainstream psychology and attempts to apply psychological understandings in more progressive ways, often looking towards social change as a means of preventing and treating psychopathology. One of critical psychology's main criticisms of conventional psychology is that it fails to consider or deliberately ignores the way power differences between social classes and groups can affect the mental and physical well-being of individuals or groups of people.  It does this, in part, because it tends to explain behavior at the level of the individual. 

Crossfire<====>7803<====>Crossfire  A crossfire (also known as interlocking fire) is a military term for the siting of weapons (often automatic weapons such as assault rifles or sub-machine guns) so that their arcs of fire overlap.   Plainclothes and Off-duty Officer Survival: 0398055289John Charles Cheek, Tony Lesce - 1988 "Bunching up nullifies any chance of catching an adversary in a cross-fire.  Figure 13.  Crossfire is a very powerful tactic.  It enables a pair of combatants to catch an opponent from two directions at once.  Cross-fire can even menace an adversary . . "  This tactic came to prominence in World War I. 

Cruising (maritime)<====>7806<====>Cruising (maritime) Cruising by boat is a lifestyle that involves living for extended time on a vessel while traveling from place to place for pleasure.   Cruising generally refers to trips of a few days or more, and can extend to round-the-world voyages. History Boats were almost exclusively used for working purposes prior to the nineteenth century.  In 1857, the philosopher Henry David Thoreau, with his book Canoeing in Wilderness chronicling his canoe voyaging in the wilderness of Maine, was the first to convey the enjoyment of spiritual and lifestyle aspects of cruising. The modern conception of cruising for pleasure was first popularised by the Scottish explorer and sportsman John MacGregor. 

Cavitation<====>7807<====>Cavitation Cavitation is the formation of vapour cavities in a liquid, small liquid-free zones ("bubbles" or "voids"), that are the consequence of forces acting upon the liquid.  It usually occurs when a liquid is subjected to rapid changes of pressure that cause the formation of cavities in the liquid where the pressure is relatively low.  When subjected to higher pressure, the voids implode and can generate an intense shock wave. Cavitation is a significant cause of wear in some engineering contexts.  Collapsing voids that implode near to a metal surface cause cyclic stress through repeated implosion.  This results in surface fatigue of the metal causing a type of wear also called "cavitation". 

Cyprinodontiformes<====>7808<====>Cyprinodontiformes Cyprinodontiformes   is an order of ray-finned fish, comprising mostly small, freshwater fish.    Many popular aquarium fish, such as killifish and live-bearers, are included.   They are closely related to the Atheriniformes and are occasionally included with them.   A colloquial term for the order as a whole is toothcarps, though they are not actually close relatives of the true carps – the latter belong to the superorder Ostariophysi, while the toothcarps are Acanthopterygii. The families of Cyprinodontiformes can be divided into three groups: viviparous and ovoviviparous (all species give live birth), and oviparous (all species egg-laying).

Click consonant<====>7816<====>Click consonant Click consonants, or clicks, are speech sounds that occur as consonants in many languages of Southern Africa and in three languages of East Africa.  Examples familiar to English-speakers are the Tut-tut (British spelling) or Tsk! Tsk! (American spelling) used to express disapproval or pity, the tchick! used to spur on a horse, and the clip-clop! sound children make with their tongue to imitate a horse trotting. Technically, clicks are obstruents articulated with two closures (points of contact) in the mouth, one forward and one at the back.  The enclosed pocket of air is rarefied by a sucking action of the tongue (in technical terminology, clicks have a lingual ingressive airstream mechanism). 

The Cider House Rules<====>7817<====>The Cider House Rules  The Cider House Rules (1985) is John Irving's sixth published novel, a Bildungsroman, and was later adapted into a film (1999) and a stage play by Peter Parnell.

Consumer<====>7818<====>Consumer  A consumer is a person or organization that uses economic services or commodities.  Economics and marketingThe consumer is the one who pays something to consume goods and services produced.  As such, consumers play a vital role in the economic system of a nation.  Without consumer demand, producers would lack one of the key motivations to produce: to sell to consumers.  The consumer also forms part of the chain of distribution. Recently in marketing instead of marketers generating broad demographic profiles and Fisio-graphic profiles of market segments, marketers have started to engage in personalized marketing, permission marketing, and mass customization.

Civilian Conservation Corps<====>7821<====>Civilian Conservation Corps The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was a public work relief program that operated from 1933 to 1942 in the United States for unemployed, unmarried men.  Originally for young men ages 18–25, it was eventually expanded to young men ages 17–28.   Robert Fechner was the first director of the agency, succeeded by James McEntee following Fechner's death.  The CCC was a major part of President Franklin D.  Roosevelt's New Deal that provided unskilled manual labor jobs related to the conservation and development of natural resources in rural lands owned by federal, state, and local governments. 

Caribbean Sea<====>7822<====>Caribbean Sea  The Caribbean Sea ( ;    ) is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean in the tropics of the Western Hemisphere.  It is bounded by Mexico and Central America to the west and south west, to the north by the Greater Antilles starting with Cuba, to the east by the Lesser Antilles, and to the south by the north coast of South America. The entire area of the Caribbean Sea, the numerous islands of the West Indies, and adjacent coasts, are collectively known as the Caribbean.  The Caribbean Sea is one of the largest seas and has an area of about  . 

Colin Maclaurin<====>7824<====>Colin Maclaurin   Colin Maclaurin ( ;  ;  1 February 1698 – 14 June 1746)  was a Scottish mathematician who made important contributions to geometry and algebra.   The Maclaurin series, a special case of the Taylor series, is named after him. Owing to changes in orthography since that time (his name was originally rendered as “M‘Laurine” ), his surname is alternatively written MacLaurin.  Early lifeMaclaurin was born in Kilmodan, Argyll.  His father, Reverend and Minister of Glendaruel John Maclaurin, died when Maclaurin was in infancy, and his mother died before he reached nine years of age. 

Celestial globe<====>7825<====>Celestial globe Celestial globes show the apparent positions of the stars in the sky.  They omit the Sun, Moon, and planets because the positions of these bodies vary relative to those of the stars, but the ecliptic, along which the Sun moves, is indicated. There is an issue regarding the “handedness” of celestial globes.  If the globe is constructed so that the stars are in the positions they actually occupy on the imaginary celestial sphere, then the star field will appear back-to-front on the surface of the globe (all the constellations will appear as their mirror images).  This is because the view from Earth, positioned at the centre of the celestial sphere, is of the inside of the celestial sphere, whereas the celestial globe is viewed from the outside. 

Covenant-breaker<====>7827<====>Covenant-breaker   Covenant-breaker is a term used by Bahá'ís to refer to a person who has been excommunicated from the Bahá'í community for the act of covenant-breaking, roughly defined as active opposition to the Bahá'í Faith from a current member.  According to Bahá'í law, only the head of the religion, currently the Universal House of Justice, has the authority to declare a person a covenant-breaker.   A person may be declared a covenant-breaker for actions which are seen as challenging the unity of the Bahá'í community, not for personal matters such as failure to obey Bahá'í law or conversion to another religion. 

Concord, Michigan<====>7828<====>Concord, Michigan  Concord is a village in Jackson County in the U. S.  state of Michigan.  The population was 1,050 at the 2010 census.  The village is located at  , west of Spring Arbor, Michigan. HistoryConcord first received a post office in 1836.   It was incorporated as a village in 1871.  The Michigan Historical Center operates a museum in Concord called the Mann House.  The Mann House is an excellent example of typical middle-class domestic architecture of the early 1880s and features the family's sleigh and buggy as well as Jackson's Michigan State Prison made furniture. 

Chaos Computer Club<====>7829<====>Chaos Computer Club  The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) is Europe's largest association of hackers  with 5,500 registered members.    It is incorporated as an eingetragener Verein in Germany, with local chapters (called Erfa-Kreise) in various cities in Germany and other German-speaking countries. Some chapters in Switzerland are organized in the independent sister association Chaos Computer Club Schweiz instead. The CCC describes itself as "a galactic community of life forms, independent of age, sex, race or societal orientation, which strives across borders for freedom of information. . . . " In general, the CCC advocates more transparency in government, freedom of information, and the human right to communication. 

Convention (norm)<====>7830<====>Convention (norm)  A convention is a set of  , stipulated, or generally accepted  s, norms, social norms, or  , often taking the form of a custom. Certain types of rules or customs may become law and regulatory legislation may be introduced to formalize or enforce the convention (for example, laws that define on which side of the road vehicles must be driven).  In a social context, a convention may retain the character of an "unwritten law" of custom (for example, the manner in which people greet each other, such as by shaking each other's hands). 

Complete metric space<====>7832<====>Complete metric space In mathematical analysis, a metric space M is called complete (or a Cauchy space) if every Cauchy sequence of points in M has a limit that is also in M or, alternatively, if every Cauchy sequence in M converges in M. Intuitively, a space is complete if there are no "points missing" from it (inside or at the boundary).  For instance, the set of rational numbers is not complete, because e. g.   \sqrt{2}  is "missing" from it, even though one can construct a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers that converges to it.  (See the examples below. 

The Amazing Criswell<====>7833<====>The Amazing Criswell  For the mentalist Kreskin (born 1935), see The Amazing Kreskin. Jeron Criswell King (August 18, 1907 – October 4, 1982), born Jeron Criswell Konig, and known by his stage-name The Amazing Criswell  , was an American psychic known for wildly inaccurate predictions.  In person, he went by Charles Criswell King, and was sometimes credited as Jeron King Criswell. Criswell was flamboyant, with spit curled hair, a   style of speaking, and a sequined tuxedo.  He owned a coffin in which he claimed to sleep.  He grew up in a troubled family in Indiana with relatives who owned a funeral home, and said that he became comfortable with sleeping in caskets in the storeroom. 

Chain reaction<====>7834<====>Chain reaction A chain reaction is a sequence of reactions where a reactive product or by-product causes additional reactions to take place.  In a chain reaction, positive feedback leads to a self-amplifying chain of events. Chain reactions are one way in which systems which are in thermodynamic non-equilibrium can release energy or increase entropy in order to reach a state of higher entropy.  For example, a system may not be able to reach a lower energy state by releasing energy into the environment, because it is hindered or prevented in some way from taking the path that will result in the energy release. 

Caddie<====>7837<====>Caddie In golf, a caddie (or caddy) is the person who carries a player's bag and clubs, and gives insightful advice and moral support.  A good caddie is aware of the challenges and obstacles of the golf course being played, along with the best strategy in playing it.  This includes knowing overall yardage, pin placements and club selection.  A caddie is not usually an employee of a private club or resort.  They are classified as an "independent contractor," meaning that he or she is basically self-employed and does not receive any benefits or perks from his association with the club. 

Compound turbine<====>7838<====>Compound turbineA compound turbine is a steam turbine in which there are two casings, a high-pressure casing and a low-pressure casing, operating in concert to extract work from a single source of steam.  The steam is partially expanded in the high-pressure casing, then exhausted to the low-pressure casing.  Tandem compound or cross compoundThe rotor arrangement can be either tandem-compound  in which the two axles are joined end to end, or cross-compound in which the two turbines have separate axles.  In the cross-compound case two separate generators are usually supplied, although a gearbox can reduce this to one. 

Corona<====>7839<====>Corona A corona (Latin, 'crown') is an aura of plasma that surrounds the Sun and other stars.  The Sun's corona extends millions of kilometres into space and is most easily seen during a total solar eclipse, but it is also observable with a coronagraph.  The word corona is a Latin word meaning "crown", from the Ancient Greek κορώνη (korōnè, “garland, wreath”). The high temperature of the Sun's corona gives it unusual spectral features, which led some in the 19th century to suggest that it contained a previously unknown element, "coronium".  Instead, these spectral features have since been explained by highly ionized iron (Fe-XIV). 

Chrono Cross<====>7840<====>Chrono Cross    is a 1999 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the PlayStation video game console.  It is the successor to Chrono Trigger, which was released in 1995 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.  Chrono Cross was designed primarily by scenarist and director Masato Kato, who had help from other designers who also worked on Chrono Trigger, including art director Yasuyuki Honne and composer Yasunori Mitsuda.  Nobuteru Yūki designed the characters of the game. The story of Chrono Cross focuses on a teenage boy named Serge and a theme of parallel worlds. 

Planned economy<====>7843<====>Planned economy  A planned economy is a type of economic system where investment and the allocation of capital goods is performed through economy-wide economic and production plans.  A planned economy may be based on centralized, decentralized or participatory forms of economic planning.    A command economy or administrative command economy refers to the nominally-planned economies of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc, highlighting the central role of hierarchical administration in guiding the allocation of resources in these economic systems as opposed to planned coordination.Planned economies are usually associated with Soviet-type central planning, which involves centralized state planning and administrative decision making. 

Common chimpanzee<====>7844<====>Common chimpanzee The common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), also known as the robust chimpanzee, is a species of great ape.  Colloquially, the common chimpanzee is often called the chimpanzee (or "chimp"), though this term can be used to refer to both species in the genus Pan: the common chimpanzee and the closely related bonobo, formerly called the pygmy chimpanzee.  Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows  both species of chimpanzee are the sister taxon to the modern human lineage. The common chimpanzee is covered in coarse black hair, but has a bare face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. 

Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease<====>7845<====>Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease  Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) is one of the hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies, a group of varied inherited disorders of the peripheral nervous system characterized by progressive loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation across various parts of the body.  Currently incurable, this disease is the most commonly inherited neurological disorder, and affects approximately 1 in 2,500 people. CMT was previously classified as a subtype of muscular dystrophy.    Signs and symptomsSymptoms of CMT usually begin in early childhood or early adulthood, but can begin later.  Some people do not experience symptoms until their early thirties or forties. 

Central pontine myelinolysis<====>7846<====>Central pontine myelinolysis Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) is a neurological disorder caused by severe damage of the myelin sheath of nerve cells in the area of the brainstem termed the pons, predominately of iatrogenic, treatment-induced cause.  It is characterized by acute paralysis,  dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), and dysarthria (difficulty speaking), and other neurological symptoms. Central pontine myelinolysis was first described by Adams et al.  in 1959 as a clinicopathological entity.  The original paper described four cases with fatal outcomes, and the findings on autopsy.  The cause was not known then but the authors suspected either a toxin or a nutritional deficiency. 

Crystallographic defect<====>7849<====>Crystallographic defectCrystalline solids exhibit a periodic crystal structure.  The positions of atoms or molecules occur on repeating fixed distances, determined by the unit cell parameters.  However, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in most crystalline materials is not perfect.  The regular patterns are interrupted by crystallographic defects.  Ehrhart, P.  (1991) Properties and interactions of atomic defects in metals and alloys, volume 25 of Landolt-Börnstein, New Series III, chapter 2, p.  88, Springer, Berlin    Point defectsPoint defects are defects that occur only at or around a single lattice point.  They are not extended in space in any dimension. 

Chomsky normal form<====>7850<====>Chomsky normal formIn formal language theory, a context-free grammar G is said to be in Chomsky normal form (first described by Noam Chomsky)  if all of its production rules are of the form:    A → BC,   orA → a,   orS → ε,where A, B, and C are nonterminal symbols, a is a terminal symbol (a symbol that represents a constant value), S is the start symbol, and ε denotes the empty string.   Also, neither B nor C may be the start symbol, and the third production rule can only appear if ε is in L(G), namely, the language produced by the context-free grammar G. 

Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty<====>7851<====>Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is a multilateral treaty that bans all nuclear explosions, for both civilian and military purposes, in all environments.  It was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 September 1996, but has not entered into force, as eight specific states have not ratified the treaty. HistoryThe movement for international control of nuclear weapons began in 1945, with a call from Canada and United Kingdom for a conference on the subject.   In June 1946, Bernard Baruch, an emissary of President Harry S.  Truman, proposed the Baruch Plan before the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, which called for an international system of controls on the production of atomic energy. 

Dance<====>7885<====>Dance Dance is a performing art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement.  This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture.   Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin. An important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of theatrical and participatory dance,  although these two categories are not always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether social, ceremonial, competitive, erotic, martial, or sacred/liturgical. 

Drew Barrymore<====>7886<====>Drew Barrymore   Drew Blythe Barrymore (born February 22, 1975)    is an American actress, author, director, model and producer.  She is a member of the Barrymore family of American stage and film actors, and a granddaughter of actor John Barrymore.  Beginning as a child actress on television, she soon transitioned to feature films, including her biggest box office success, E. T.  the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). Following a highly publicized, turbulent childhood marked by drug and alcohol abuse with two stints in rehab,   she released her autobiography, Little Girl Lost (1991).  Barrymore appeared in a string of successful films, including Poison Ivy (1992), Scream (1996), and Ever After (1998). 

D. W. Griffith<====>7888<====>D.  W.  Griffith  David Wark Griffith (January 22, 1875 – July 23, 1948)    was an American director, writer, and producer who pioneered modern filmmaking techniques. Griffith is most remembered for The Birth of a Nation (1915) and Intolerance (1916).The Birth of a Nation made use of advanced camera and narrative techniques, and its popularity set the stage for the dominance of the feature-length film in the United States.  Since its release, the film has sparked significant controversy surrounding race in the United States,   focusing on its negative depiction of black people and the glorification of the Ku Klux Klan. 

Dune<====>7890<====>Dune In physical geography, a dune is a hill of loose sand built by aeolian processes (wind) or the flow of water.Dunes occur in different shapes and sizes, formed by interaction with the flow of air or water.  Most kinds of dunes are longer on the stoss (upflow) side, where the sand is pushed up the dune, and have a shorter "slip face" in the lee side.  The valley or trough between dunes is called a slack.  A "dune field" or erg is an area covered by extensive dunes.  Dunes occur in some deserts and along some coasts. 

David Lynch<====>7891<====>David Lynch    David Keith Lynch (born January 20, 1946) is an American director, screenwriter, producer, painter, musician, actor, and photographer.  He has been described by The Guardian as "the most important director of this era. "  AllMovie called him "the Renaissance man of modern American filmmaking,"  while the success of his films has led to him being labelled "the first popular Surrealist. " Born to a middle-class family in Missoula, Montana, Lynch spent his childhood traveling around the United States, before going on to study painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where he first made the transition to producing short films. 

David Cronenberg<====>7892<====>David Cronenberg  David Paul Cronenberg,   (born March 15, 1943) is a Canadian director, screenwriter and actor.   Cronenberg is one of the principal originators of what is commonly known as the body horror or visceral horror genre.  This style of filmmaking explores people's fears of bodily transformation and infection.  In his films, the psychological is typically intertwined with the physical. In the first half of his career, he explored these themes mostly through horror and science fiction, although his work has since expanded beyond these genres.  His films have won numerous awards, including the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival for his film Crash (1996). 

Dale Earnhardt<====>7893<====>Dale Earnhardt    Ralph Dale Earnhardt Sr.  ( ; April 29, 1951 – February 18, 2001),    known professionally as Dale Earnhardt, was an American professional stock car racing driver and team owner, best known for his involvement in stock car racing for NASCAR.

Vladimir Harkonnen<====>7901<====>Vladimir Harkonnen The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is a fictional character and antagonist from the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert.  He is primarily featured in the 1965 novel Dune and is also a prominent character in the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy (1999-2001) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J.  Anderson.  The character is brought back as a ghola in the Herbert/Anderson sequels which conclude the original series, Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007). ConceptionFrank Herbert wanted a harsh-sounding name for the antagonists of his novel, Dune.  Herbert came across the name "Härkönen" in a California telephone book and thought that it sounded "Soviet" (it is in fact Finnish), which touched a nerve with Cold War-era readers. 

Piter De Vries<====>7902<====>Piter De Vries  Piter De Vries is a fictional character from the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert.  He is primarily featured in the 1965 novel Dune, but also appears in the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy (1999–2001) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J.  Anderson. De Vries is portrayed by Brad Dourif in David Lynch's 1984 film Dune, and by Jan Unger in the 2000 Dune miniseries. CharacterIn the service of the ruthless Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, De Vries is a Mentat — a human specially trained to perform mental functions rivaling computers, which are forbidden universe-wide.  In addition, De Vries has been "twisted" into an amoral sadist by his Tleilaxu creators. 

Diffie–Hellman key exchange<====>7903<====>Diffie–Hellman key exchange Diffie–Hellman key exchange (DH) Synonyms of Diffie–Hellman key exchange include:Diffie–Hellman–Merkle key exchangeDiffie–Hellman key agreementDiffie–Hellman key establishmentDiffie–Hellman key negotiationExponential key exchangeDiffie–Hellman protocolDiffie–Hellman handshake  is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel and was one of the first public-key protocols as originally conceptualized by Ralph Merkle and named after Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. DH is one of the earliest practical examples of public key exchange implemented within the field of cryptography.  Traditionally, secure encrypted communication between two parties required that they first exchange keys by some secure physical channel, such as paper key lists transported by a trusted courier. 

Destry Rides Again<====>7906<====>Destry Rides Again  Destry Rides Again is a 1939 western starring Marlene Dietrich and James Stewart, and directed by George Marshall.  The supporting cast includes Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, Brian Donlevy, Allen Jenkins, Irene Hervey, Billy Gilbert, Bill Cody, Jr. , Lillian Yarbo, and Una Merkel.  Although the title comes from Max Brand's popular novel, which inspired the earlier screenplay with Tom Mix, this version is almost entirely unrelated to either. In 1996, Destry Rides Again was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". 

Derivative<====>7921<====>Derivative   The derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value).  Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus.   For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object's velocity: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances. The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. 

Dravidian languages<====>7922<====>Dravidian languagesThe Dravidian languages are a language family spoken mainly in southern India and parts of eastern and central India, as well as in Sri Lanka with small pockets in southwestern Pakistan, southern Afghanistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan,  and overseas in other countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore.  The Dravidian languages with the most speakers are Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam.  There are also small groups of Dravidian-speaking scheduled tribes, who live outside Dravidian-speaking areas, such as the Kurukh in Eastern India and Gondi in Central India.    Though some scholars have argued that the Dravidian languages may have been brought to India by migrations in the fourth or third millennium BCEor even earlier,   the Dravidian languages cannot easily be connected to any other language family, and they could well be indigenous to India. 

Dracula<====>7923<====>Dracula   Dracula is an 1897 Gothic horror novel by Irish author Bram Stoker.  It introduced Count Dracula, and established many conventions of subsequent vampire fantasy.   The novel tells the story of Dracula's attempt to move from Transylvania to England so that he may find new blood and spread the undead curse, and of the battle between Dracula and a small group of men and a woman led by Professor Abraham Van Helsing. Dracula has been assigned to many literary genres including vampire literature, horror fiction, the gothic novel, and invasion literature.  The novel has spawned numerous theatrical, film, and television interpretations. 

David Hume<====>7925<====>David Hume David Hume ( ; born David Home; 7 May 1711 NS  (26 April 1711 OS)  – 25 August 1776) was a Scottish philosopher, historian, economist, and essayist, who is best known today for his highly influential system of philosophical empiricism, skepticism, and naturalism. Hume's empiricist approach to philosophy places him with John Locke, Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes as a British Empiricist.   Beginning with his A Treatise of Human Nature (1739), Hume strove to create a total naturalistic science of man that examined the psychological basis of human nature. 

Dalton Trumbo<====>7928<====>Dalton Trumbo  James Dalton Trumbo (December 9, 1905 – September 10, 1976) was an American screenwriter and novelist who scripted many award-winning films including Roman Holiday, Exodus, Spartacus, and Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo.  One of the Hollywood Ten, he refused to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1947 during the committee's investigation of communist influences in the motion picture industry.   He, along with the other members of the Hollywood Ten and hundreds of other industry professionals, was subsequently blacklisted by that industry.  His talents as one of the top screenwriters allowed him to continue working clandestinely, producing work under other authors' names. 

Delaware<====>7930<====>DelawareDelaware ( )  is one of the 50 states of the United States, located in the Mid-Atlantic or Northeastern region.   It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland, to the north by Pennsylvania, and to the east by New Jersey and the Atlantic Ocean.  The state takes its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor.  Delaware occupies the northeastern portion of the Delmarva Peninsula.  It is the second smallest and sixth least populous state, but the sixth most densely populated. 

Dictionary<====>7931<====>Dictionary A dictionary, sometimes known as a wordbook, is a collection of words in one or more specific languages, often arranged alphabetically (or by radical and stroke for ideographic languages), which may include information on definitions, usage, etymologies, phonetics, pronunciations, translation, etc.  Webster's New World College Dictionary, Fourth Edition, 2002  or a book of words in one language with their equivalents in another, sometimes known as a lexicon.   It is a lexicographical product which shows inter-relationships among the data.  A broad distinction is made between general and specialized dictionaries.  Specialized dictionaries include words in specialist fields, rather than a complete range of words in the language. 

David D. Friedman<====>7935<====>David D.  Friedman  David Director Friedman (born February 12, 1945) is an American economist, physicist, legal scholar, and libertarian theorist.  He is known for his textbook writings on microeconomics and the libertarian theory of anarcho-capitalism, which is the subject of his most popular book, The Machinery of Freedom.   Besides The Machinery of Freedom, he has authored several other books and articles, including Price Theory: An Intermediate Text (1986), Law's Order: What Economics Has to Do with Law and Why It Matters (2000), Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life (1996), and Future Imperfect (2008).  Life and workDavid Friedman is the son of economists Rose and Milton Friedman. 

Diatomic molecule<====>7938<====>Diatomic molecule Diatomic molecules are molecules composed of only two atoms, of the same or different chemical elements.  The prefix di- is of Greek origin, meaning "two".  If a diatomic molecule consists of two atoms of the same element, such as hydrogen (H 2 ) or oxygen (O 2 ), then it is said to be homonuclear.  Otherwise, if a diatomic molecule consists of two different atoms, such as carbon monoxide (CO) or nitric oxide (NO), the molecule is said to be heteronuclear. The only chemical elements that form stable homonuclear diatomic molecules at standard temperature and pressure (STP) (or typical laboratory conditions of 1 bar and 25 °C) are the gases hydrogen (H 2 ), nitrogen (N 2 ), oxygen (O 2 ), fluorine (F 2 ), and chlorine (Cl 2 ). 

Duopoly<====>7939<====>Duopoly A duopoly (from Greek δύο, duo (two) + πωλεῖν, polein (to sell)) is a form of oligopoly where only two sellers exist in one market.  In practice, the term is also used where two firms have dominant control over a market.  It is the most commonly studied form of oligopoly due to its simplicity. Duopoly models in economics and game theoryThere are two principal duopoly models, Cournot duopoly and Bertrand duopoly:The Cournot model, which shows that two firms assume each other's output and treat this as a fixed amount, and produce in their own firm according to this. 

Dungeons & Dragons<====>7940<====>Dungeons & Dragons   Dungeons & Dragons (abbreviated as D&D Mead, Malcomson; Dungeons & Dragons FAQ  or DnD) is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game (RPG) originally designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson.  It was first published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules, Inc.  (TSR).  The game has been published by Wizards of the Coast (now a subsidiary of Hasbro) since 1997.  It was derived from miniature wargames with a variation of Chainmail serving as the initial rule system.   D&D  publication is commonly recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game industry. 

Double jeopardy<====>7941<====>Double jeopardy    Double jeopardy is a procedural defence  that prevents an accused person from being tried again on the same (or similar) charges and on the same facts, following a valid acquittal or conviction. If this issue is raised, evidence will be placed before the court, which will normally rule as a preliminary matter whether the plea is substantiated; if it is, the projected trial will be prevented from proceeding.  In some countries, including Canada, Mexico and the United States, the guarantee against being "twice put in jeopardy" is a constitutional right.    In other countries, the protection is afforded by statute. 

Disbarment<====>7942<====>Disbarment    Disbarment is the removal of a lawyer from a bar association or the practice of law, thus revoking his or her law license or admission to practice law.  Disbarment is usually a punishment for unethical or criminal conduct.  Procedures vary depending on the law society. GermanyIn Germany, the Berufsverbot is a ban on practicing a profession, which can be issued to a lawyer for misconduct, Volksverhetzung or for serious mismanagement of personal finances. In April 1933, the Nazi government issued a Berufsverbot forbidding the practice of law by Jews, communists, and other political opponents, except for those protected by the Frontkämpferprivileg. 

Dog tag<====>7946<====>Dog tag  "Dog tags" is an informal but common term for the identification tags worn by military personnel.  The tags are primarily used for the identification of dead and wounded soldiers; they have personal information about the soldiers and convey essential basic medical information, such as blood type  and history of inoculations.  The tags often indicate religious preference as well.  Dog tags are usually fabricated from a corrosion-resistant metal.  They commonly contain two copies of the information, either in the form of a single tag that can be broken in half or two identical tags on the same chain. 

Drum<====>7950<====>Drum The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments.  In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone.Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a drum stick, to produce sound.  There is usually a resonance head on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead.  Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. 

Delphi<====>7951<====>Delphi  Delphi (  or  ;    )  is famous as the ancient sanctuary that grew rich as the seat of Pythia, the oracle consulted about important decisions throughout the ancient classical world.  Moreover, the Greeks considered Delphi the navel (or centre) of the world, as represented by the stone monument known as the Omphalos of Delphi. It occupies an impressive site on the south-western slope of Mount Parnassus, overlooking the coastal plain to the south and the valley of Phocis.  It is now an extensive archaeological site with a modern town of the same name nearby. 

Digital Equipment Corporation<====>7952<====>Digital Equipment Corporation  Digital Equipment Corporation, also known as DEC and using the trademark Digital, was a major American company in the computer industry from the 1950s to the 1990s. DEC was a leading vendor of computer systems, including computers, software, and peripherals.  Their PDP and successor VAX products were the most successful of all minicomputers in terms of sales. DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq, in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry.  The merger did not work well and Compaq soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. 

Dead Kennedys<====>7954<====>Dead Kennedys   Dead Kennedys are an American punk rock band that formed in San Francisco, California, in 1978.  The band was one of the first American hardcore bands to make a significant impact in the United Kingdom. Dead Kennedys' lyrics were usually political in nature, satirizing establishment political figures (both liberal and conservative) and authority in general, as well as popular culture and even the punk movement itself.  During their initial incarnation between 1978 and 1986, they attracted considerable controversy for their provocative lyrics and artwork.  Several stores refused to stock their recordings, provoking debate about censorship in rock music; in the mid 1980s, vocalist and primary lyricist Jello Biafra became an active campaigner against the Parents Music Resource Center. 

DNA<====>7955<====>DNA    Deoxyribonucleic acid ( ;  DNA) is a thread-like chain of nucleotides carrying the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses.  DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life.  Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. The two DNA strands are called polynucleotides since they are composed of simpler monomer units called nucleotides. 

Kennedy family<====>7957<====>Kennedy familyThe Kennedy family is an American political family that has been prominent in American politics, public service, and business.  At least one Kennedy family member held federal elective office in every year between 1947 and 2011, and then from 2013 onwards, a span of time comprising more than a quarter of the nation's existence.The descendants of Joseph P.  Kennedy, Sr.  and Rose Kennedy include six members of the United States House of Representatives or Senate, one of whom became president of the United States; as well as two U. 

Democracy<====>7959<====>Democracy Democracy (   , literally "rule of the people"), in modern usage, is a system of government in which the citizens exercise power directly or elect representatives from among themselves to form a governing body, such as a parliament.   Democracy is sometimes referred to as "rule of the majority".   Democracy is a system of processing conflicts in which outcomes depend on what participants do, but no single force controls what occurs and its outcomes.  The uncertainty of outcomes is inherent in democracy, which makes all forces struggle repeatedly for the realization of their interests, being the devolution of power from a group of people to a set of rules. 

Logical disjunction<====>7962<====>Logical disjunction  In logic and mathematics, or is the truth-functional operator of (inclusive) disjunction, also known as alternation; the or of a set of operands is true if and only if one or more of its operands is true.   The logical connective that represents this operator is typically written as ∨ or +. "A or B" is true if A is true, or if B is true, or if both A and B are true. In logic, or by itself means the inclusive or, distinguished from an exclusive or, which is false when both of its arguments are true, while an "or" is true in that case. 

Disjunctive syllogism<====>7963<====>Disjunctive syllogism In classical logic, disjunctive syllogism   (historically known as modus tollendo ponens) is a valid argument form  which is a syllogism having a disjunctive statement for one of its premises.   The breach is a safety violation, or it is not subject to fines. The breach is not a safety violation. Therefore, it is not subject to fines. In propositional logic, disjunctive syllogism (also known as disjunction elimination and or elimination, or abbreviated ∨E),is a valid rule of inference.  If we are told that at least one of two statements is true; and also told that it is not the former that is true; we can infer that it has to be the latter that is true. 

Definition<====>7964<====>Definition  A definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols).   Definitions can be classified into two large categories, intensional definitions (which try to give the essence of a term) and extensional definitions (which proceed by listing the objects that a term describes).  Lyons, John.  "Semantics, vol.  I. " Cambridge: Cambridge (1977).  p. 158 and on.   Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples.  A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions. 

Disco<====>7966<====>Disco   Disco is a musical style originating in the early 1970s.  It began to emerge from America's urban nightlife scene, where it had been curtailed to house parties and makeshift discotheques from the middle of the decade onwards, after which, it began making regular mainstream appearances, gaining popularity and increasing airplay on radio.  Its popularity was achieved sometime during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s.  Its initial audiences in the U. S.  were club-goers, both male and female, from the African American, Italian American, Shapiro, Peter.  "Turn the Beat Around: The Rise and Fall of Disco", Macmillan, 2006.

Donegal fiddle tradition<====>7973<====>Donegal fiddle tradition  The Donegal fiddle tradition is the way of playing the fiddle that is traditional in County Donegal, Ireland.  It is one of the distinct fiddle traditions within Irish traditional music.    The distinctness of the Donegal tradition developed due to the close relations between Donegal and Scotland, and the Donegal repertoire and style has influences from Scottish fiddle music.  For example, in addition to the standard tune types such as Jigs and Reels, the Donegal tradition also has Highlands (influenced by the Scottish Strathspey).  The distinctiveness of the Donegal tradition led to some conflict between Donegal players and representatives of the mainstream tradition when Irish traditional music was organised in the 1960s. 

Double-barreled shotgun<====>7975<====>Double-barreled shotgunA double-barreled shotgun is a shotgun with two parallel barrels, allowing two shots to be fired. ConstructionModern double-barreled shotguns, often known as doubles, are almost universally break open actions, with the barrels tilting up at the rear to expose the breech ends of the barrels for unloading and reloading.   Since there is no reciprocating action needed to eject and reload the shells, doubles are more compact than repeating designs such as pump action or lever-action shotguns. Barrel configuration Double-barreled shotguns come in two basic configurations: the side-by-side shotgun (SxS) and the over/under shotgun ("over and under", O/U, etc. 

Dessert<====>7976<====>Dessert   Dessert ( ) is a confectionery course that concludes a main meal.  The course usually consists of sweet foods, and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine or liqueur, but may include coffee, cheeses, nuts, or other savory items.  In some parts of the world, such as much of central and western Africa, and most parts of China, there is no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal. The term "dessert" can apply to many confections, such as cakes, tarts, cookies, biscuits, gelatins, pastries, ice creams, pies, puddings, custards, and sweet soups.  Fruit is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its naturally occurring sweetness. 

Data Encryption Standard<====>7978<====>Data Encryption Standard The Data Encryption Standard (DES,  ) is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of electronic data.  Although now considered insecure, it was highly influential in the advancement of modern cryptography. Developed in the early 1970s at IBM and based on an earlier design by Horst Feistel, the algorithm was submitted to the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) following the agency's invitation to propose a candidate for the protection of sensitive, unclassified electronic government data.  In 1976, after consultation with the National Security Agency (NSA), the NBS eventually selected a slightly modified version (strengthened against differential cryptanalysis, but weakened against brute-force attacks), which was published as an official Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for the United States in 1977. 

Double-hulled tanker<====>7983<====>Double-hulled tankerA double-hulled tanker refers to an oil tanker which has a double hull.  They reduce the likelihood of leaks occurring than in single-hulled tankers, and their ability to prevent or reduce oil spills led to double hulls being standardized for oil tankers and other types of ships including by the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships or MARPOL Convention. After the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster in Alaska in 1989, the US Government required all new oil tankers built for use between US ports to be equipped with a full double hull. 

Drink<====>7984<====>Drink   A drink or beverage is a liquid intended for human consumption. In addition to their basic function of satisfying thirst, drinks play important roles in human culture.  Common types of drinks include plain water, milk, juices, coffee, tea, and soft drinks.  In addition, alcoholic drinks such as wine, beer, and liquor, which contain the drug ethanol, have been part of human culture and development for 8,000 years. Non-alcoholic drinks often signify drinks that would normally contain alcohol, such as beer and wine, but are made with less than . 5 percent alcohol by volume.  The category includes drinks that have undergone an alcohol removal process such as non-alcoholic beers and de-alcoholized wines. 

Dill<====>7985<====>Dill  Dill (Anethum graveolens) is an annual herb in the celery family Apiaceae.  It is the only species in the genus Anethum.  Dill is widely grown in Eurasia where its leaves and seeds are used as a herb or spice for flavouring food. GrowthDill grows up to  , with slender hollow stems and alternate, finely divided, softly delicate leaves   long.  The ultimate leaf divisions are   broad, slightly broader than the similar leaves of fennel, which are threadlike, less than   broad, but harder in texture.  The flowers are white to yellow, in small umbels   diameter. 

Dual space<====>7988<====>Dual spaceIn mathematics, any vector space V has a corresponding dual vector space (or just dual space for short) consisting of all linear functionals on V, together with the vector space structure of pointwise addition and scalar multiplication by constants. The dual space as defined above is defined for all vector spaces, and to avoid ambiguity may also be called the algebraic dual space.   When defined for a topological vector space, there is a subspace of the dual space, corresponding to continuous linear functionals, called the continuous dual space. Dual vector spaces find application in many branches of mathematics that use vector spaces, such as in tensor analysis with finite-dimensional vector spaces. 

Dianetics<====>7989<====>Dianetics    Dianetics (from Greek dia, meaning "through", and nous, meaning "mind") is a set of ideas and practices regarding the metaphysical relationship between the mind and body created by science fiction writer L.  Ron Hubbard; Dianetics is practiced by followers of Scientology , the Nation of Islam (as of 2010)    and independent Dianeticist groups.  Dianetics has achieved no acceptance as a scientific theory and is widely considered to be a pseudoscience.   Dianetics divides the mind into three parts: the conscious "analytical mind", the subconscious "reactive mind", and the somatic mind. 

Data warehouse<====>7990<====>Data warehouseIn computing, a data warehouse (DW or DWH), also known as an enterprise data warehouse (EDW), is a system used for reporting and data analysis, and is considered a core component of business intelligence.   DWs are central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources.  They store current and historical data in one single place    that are used for creating analytical reports for workers throughout the enterprise.    The data stored in the warehouse is uploaded from the operational systems (such as marketing or sales).  The data may pass through an operational data store and may require data cleansing  for additional operations to ensure data quality before it is used in the DW for reporting. 

Disperser<====>7991<====>Disperser  A disperser is a one-sided extractor.   Where an extractor requires that every event gets the same probability under the uniform distribution and the extracted distribution, only the latter is required for a disperser.  So for a disperser, an event  A \subseteq \{0,1\}^{m}  we have: Pr_{U_{m}}[A] > 1 - \epsilon Definition (Disperser): A  (k, \epsilon) -disperser is a function Dis: \{0,1\}^{n}\times \{0,1\}^{d}\rightarrow \{0,1\}^{m} such that for every distribution  X  on  \{0,1\}^{n}  with  H_{\infty}(X) \geq k  the support of the distribution  Dis(X,U_{d})  is of size at least  (1-\epsilon)2^{m} . 

Devonian<====>7992<====>Devonian  The Devonian is a geologic period and system of the Paleozoic, spanning 60 million years from the end of the Silurian,   million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Carboniferous,   Mya.It is named after Devon, England, where rocks from this period were first studied. The first significant adaptive radiation of life on dry land occurred during the Devonian.  Free-sporing vascular plants began to spread across dry land, forming extensive forests which covered the continents.  By the middle of the Devonian, several groups of plants had evolved leaves and true roots, and by the end of the period the first seed-bearing plants appeared. 

David Thompson (explorer)<====>7994<====>David Thompson (explorer)David Thompson (30 April 1770 – 10 February 1857) was a British-Canadian fur trader, surveyor, and map-maker, known to some native peoples as Koo-Koo-Sint or "the Stargazer. " Over Thompson's career, he travelled some   across North America, mapping   of North America along the way.For this historic feat, Thompson has been described as the "greatest land geographer who ever lived. " Early lifeDavid Thompson was born in Westminster, Middlesex, to recent Welsh migrants David and Ann Thompson.  When Thompson was two, his father died. 

Dioscoreales<====>7995<====>Dioscoreales  The Dioscoreales are an order of monocotyledonous flowering plants in modern classification systems, such as the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Web.   Within the monocots Dioscoreales are grouped in the lilioid monocots where they are in a sister group relationship with the Pandanales.  Of necessity the Dioscoreales contain the family Dioscoreaceae which includes the yam (Dioscorea) that is used as an important food source in many regions around the globe.  Older systems tended to place all lilioid monocots with reticulate veined leaves (such as Smilacaceae and Stemonaceae together with Dioscoraceae) in Dioscoreales. 

Dentistry<====>8005<====>Dentistry    Dentistry is a branch of medicine that consists of the study, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases, disorders and conditions of the oral cavity, commonly in the dentition  but also the oral mucosa, and of adjacent and related structures and tissues, particularly in the maxillofacial (jaw and facial) area.   Although primarily associated with teeth among the general public, the field of dentistry or dental medicine is not limited to teeth but includes other aspects of the craniofacial complex including the temperomandibular and other supporting structures.  Dentistry is often also understood to subsume the now largely defunct medical specialty of stomatology (the study of the mouth and its disorders and diseases) for which reason the two terms are used interchangeably in certain regions. 

Diameter<====>8007<====>Diameter  In geometry, a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle.  It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle.  Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere. In more modern usage, the length of a diameter is also called the diameter.  In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter (which refers to the line itself), because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length, this being twice the radius r. 

Direct examination<====>8008<====>Direct examination  The  direct examination or examination-in-chief is one stage in the process of   evidence from witnesses in a court of law.  Direct examination is the questioning of a witness by the party who called him or her, in a trial.   Direct examination is usually performed to elicit evidence in support of facts which will satisfy a required element of a party's claim or defense. In direct examination, one is generally prohibited from asking leading questions.  This prevents a lawyer from feeding answers to a favorable witness.  An exception to this rule occurs if one side has called a witness, but it is either understood, or becomes clear, that the witness is hostile to the questioner's side of the controversy. 

Alcohol intoxication<====>8011<====>Alcohol intoxication   Alcohol intoxication, also known as drunkenness among other names, is a physiological condition that may result in psychological alterations of consciousness.  Symptoms of alcohol intoxication include euphoria, flushed skin, and decreased social inhibition at lower doses,  with larger doses producing progressively severe impairments of balance, and decision-making ability as well as nausea or vomiting from alcohol's disruptive effect on the semicircular canals of the inner ear and chemical irritation of the gastric mucosa.   Extreme levels of blood-borne alcohol may result in coma or death.  Alcohol intoxication is the result of drinking alcohol such that it entering the bloodstream faster than it can be metabolized by the body. 

Data compression<====>8013<====>Data compression In signal processing, data compression, source coding,   or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Compression can be either lossy or lossless.  Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy.  No information is lost in lossless compression.  Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information.  The process of reducing the size of a data file is often referred to as data compression.  In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding; encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted. 

History of the Democratic Republic of the Congo<====>8022<====>History of the Democratic Republic of the Congo   The region that is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo was first settled about 80,000 years ago.  The Kingdom of Kongo remained present in the region between the 14th and the early 19th centuries.  Belgian colonization began when King Leopold II founded the Congo Free State, a corporate state run solely by King Leopold.  Reports of widespread murder and torture in the rubber plantations led the Belgian government to seize the Congo from Leopold II and establish the Belgian Congo.  Under Belgian rule, the colony was run with the presence of numerous Christian organizations that wanted to Westernize the Congolese people. 

Geography of the Democratic Republic of the Congo<====>8023<====>Geography of the Democratic Republic of the CongoThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is by the Congo River Basin, which covers an area of almost  .  The country's only outlet to the Atlantic Ocean is a narrow strip of land on the north bank of the Congo River. The vast, low-lying central area is a plateau-shaped basin sloping toward the west, covered by tropical rainforest and criss-crossed by rivers, a large area of this has been categorized by the World Wildlife Fund as the Central Congolian lowland forests ecoregion.  The forest center is surrounded by mountainous terraces in the west, plateaus merging into savannahs in the south and southwest. 

Demographics of the Democratic Republic of the Congo<====>8024<====>Demographics of the Democratic Republic of the CongoThis article is about the demographic features of the population of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population. As many as 250 ethnic groups have been distinguished and named.  The most numerous people are the Luba, Mongo, and Bakongo. Although 700 local languages and dialects are spoken, the linguistic variety is bridged both by the use of French and the intermediary languages Kongo, Luba-Kasai, Swahili, and Lingala. PopulationAccording to   the total population was   in  , compared to only 12,184,000 in 1950. 

Economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo<====>8025<====>Economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Sparsely populated in relation to its area, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is home to a vast potential of natural resources and mineral wealth.  Its untapped deposits of raw minerals are estimated to be worth in excess of US$24 trillion.  Despite this, the economy has declined drastically since the mid-1980s.    At the time of its independence in 1960, the Democratic Republic of the Congo was the second most industrialized country in Africa after South Africa.  It boasted a thriving mining sector and its agriculture sector was relatively productive. 

Politics of the Democratic Republic of the Congo<====>8026<====>Politics of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Politics of the Democratic Republic of Congo take place in a framework of a republic in transition from a civil war to a semi-presidential republic. On 18 and 19 December 2005, a successful nationwide referendum was carried out on a draft constitution, which set the stage for elections in 2006.  The voting process, though technically difficult due to the lack of infrastructure, was facilitated and organized by the Congolese Independent Electoral Commission with support from the UN mission to the Congo (MONUC).  Early UN reports indicate that the voting was for the most part peaceful, but spurred violence in many parts of the war-torn east and the Kasais. 

Telecommunications in the Democratic Republic of the Congo<====>8027<====>Telecommunications in the Democratic Republic of the CongoTelecommunications in the Democratic Republic of the Congo include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet. Radio and television Radio stations: Two state-owned radio stations are supplemented by more than 100 private radio stations; transmissions of at least 2 international broadcasters are available (2007); "Communications: Democratic Republic of the Congo", World Factbook, U. S.  Central Intelligence Agency, 7 January 2014.  Retrieved 24 January 2014.  27 stations (2005); 13 stations: 3 AM, 11 FM, and 2 shortwave (2001); 16 stations: 3 AM, 12 FM, and 1 shortwave (1999). Radios: 18. 

Transport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo<====>8028<====>Transport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Ground transport in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has always been difficult.   The terrain and climate of the Congo Basin present serious barriers to road and rail construction, and the distances are enormous across this vast country.

Particular trends, styles, and attitudes would be associated with and regarded as defining particular decades (which became known as "The Twenties", "The Sixties", and so on).Century Decades 2nd millennium BC 18th century BC 1790s BC  1780s BC  1770s BC  1760s BC  1750s BC  1740s BC  1730s BC  1720s BC  1710s BC  1700s BC 17th century BC 1690s BC  1680s BC  1670s BC  1660s BC  1650s BC  1640s BC  1630s BC  1620s BC  1610s BC  1600s BC 16th century BC 1590s BC  1580s BC  1570s BC  1560s BC  1550s BC  1540s BC  1530s BC  1520s BC  1510s BC  1500s BC 15th century BC 1490s BC  1480s BC  1470s BC  1460s BC  1450s BC  1440s BC  1430s BC  1420s BC  1410s BC  1400s BC 14th century BC 1390s BC  1380s BC  1370s BC  1360s BC  1350s BC  1340s BC  1330s BC  1320s BC  1310s BC  1300s BC 13th century BC 1290s BC  1280s BC  1270s BC  1260s BC  1250s BC  1240s BC  1230s BC  1220s BC  1210s BC  1200s BC 12th century BC 1190s BC  1180s BC  1170s BC  1160s BC  1150s BC  1140s BC  1130s BC  1120s BC  1110s BC  1100s BC 11th century BC 1090s BC  1080s BC  1070s BC  1060s BC  1050s BC  1040s BC  1030s BC  1020s BC  1010s BC  1000s BC 1st millennium BC 10th century BC 990s BC  980s BC  970s BC  960s BC  950s BC  940s BC  930s BC  920s BC  910s BC  900s BC 9th century BC 890s BC  880s BC  870s BC  860s BC  850s BC  840s BC  830s BC  820s BC  810s BC  800s BC 8th century BC 790s BC  780s BC  770s BC  760s BC  750s BC  740s BC  730s BC  720s BC  710s BC  700s BC 7th century BC 690s BC  680s BC  670s BC  660s BC  650s BC  640s BC  630s BC  620s BC  610s BC  600s BC 6th century BC 590s BC  580s BC  570s BC  560s BC  550s BC  540s BC  530s BC  520s BC  510s BC  500s BC 5th century BC 490s BC  480s BC  470s BC  460s BC  450s BC  440s BC  430s BC  420s BC  410s BC  400s BC 4th century BC 390s BC  380s BC  370s BC  360s BC  350s BC  340s BC  330s BC  320s BC  310s BC  300s BC 3rd century BC 290s BC  280s BC  270s BC  260s BC  250s BC  240s BC  230s BC  220s BC  210s BC  200s BC 2nd century BC 190s BC  180s BC  170s BC  160s BC  150s BC  140s BC  130s BC  120s BC  110s BC  100s BC 1st century BC 90s BC  80s BC  70s BC  60s BC  50s BC  40s BC  30s BC  20s BC  10s BC   The 0s BC is not a decade, as it contains only nine years, not ten, due to there being no year zero.  1st millennium 1st century  The 0s is not a decade, as it contains only nine years, not ten, due to there being no year zero.   10s  20s  30s  40s  50s  60s  70s  80s  90s 2nd century 100s  110s  120s  130s  140s  150s  160s  170s  180s  190s 3rd century 200s  210s  220s  230s  240s  250s  260s  270s  280s  290s 4th century 300s  310s  320s  330s  340s  350s  360s  370s  380s  390s 5th century 400s  410s  420s  430s  440s  450s  460s  470s  480s  490s 6th century 500s  510s  520s  530s  540s  550s  560s  570s  580s  590s 7th century 600s  610s  620s  630s  640s  650s  660s  670s  680s  690s 8th century 700s  710s  720s  730s  740s  750s  760s  770s  780s  790s 9th century 800s  810s  820s  830s  840s  850s  860s  870s  880s  890s 10th century 900s  910s  920s  930s  940s  950s  960s  970s  980s  990s 2nd millennium 11th century 1000s  1010s  1020s  1030s  1040s  1050s  1060s  1070s  1080s  1090s 12th century 1100s  1110s  1120s  1130s  1140s  1150s  1160s  1170s  1180s  1190s 13th century 1200s  1210s  1220s  1230s  1240s  1250s  1260s  1270s  1280s  1290s 14th century 1300s  1310s  1320s  1330s  1340s  1350s  1360s  1370s  1380s  1390s 15th century 1400s  1410s  1420s  1430s  1440s  1450s  1460s  1470s  1480s  1490s 16th century 1500s  1510s  1520s  1530s  1540s  1550s  1560s  1570s  1580s  1590s 17th century 1600s  1610s  1620s  1630s  1640s  1650s  1660s  1670s  1680s  1690s 18th century 1700s  1710s  1720s  1730s  1740s  1750s  1760s  1770s  1780s  1790s 19th century 1800s  1810s  1820s  1830s  1840s  1850s  1860s  1870s  1880s  1890s 20th century 1900s  1910s  1920s  1930s  1940s  1950s  1960s  1970s  1980s  1990s 3rd millennium 21st century 2000s  2010s  2020s  2030s  2040s  2050s  2060s  2070s  2080s  2090s    See alsoList of yearsList of centuriesList of millenniaNotes 

Douglas Engelbart<====>8081<====>Douglas Engelbart  Douglas Carl Engelbart (January 30, 1925 – July 2, 2013) was an American engineer and inventor, and an early computer and Internet pioneer.  He is best known for his work on founding the field of human–computer interaction, particularly while at his Augmentation Research Center Lab in SRI International, which resulted in creation of the computer mouse, and the development of hypertext, networked computers, and precursors to graphical user interfaces.  These were demonstrated at The Mother of All Demos in 1968.  Engelbart's Law, the observation that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential, is named after him. 

Diamond<====>8082<====>Diamond  Diamond (  or  ) is a metastable allotrope of carbon, where the carbon atoms are arranged in a variation of the face-centered cubic crystal structure called a diamond lattice.  Diamond is less stable than graphite, but the conversion rate from diamond to graphite is negligible at standard conditions.  Diamond is renowned as a material with superlative physical qualities, most of which originate from the strong covalent bonding between its atoms.  In particular, diamond has the highest hardness and thermal conductivity of any bulk material.  Those properties determine the major industrial application of diamond in cutting and polishing tools and the scientific applications in diamond knives and diamond anvil cells. 

Dr. Dre<====>8083<====>Dr.  Dre Andre Romelle Young(born February 18, 1965),  better known by his stage name Dr.  Dre, is an American rapper, record producer, and entrepreneur.  He is the founder and current CEO of Aftermath Entertainment and Beats Electronics.  Dre was previously the co-owner of, and an artist on, Death Row Records.  He has produced albums for and overseen the careers of many rappers, including 2Pac, The D. O. C. , Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Xzibit, Knoc-turn'al, 50 Cent, The Game, and Kendrick Lamar.  He is credited as a key figure in the popularization of West Coast G-funk, a style of rap music characterized as synthesizer-based with slow, heavy beats. 

Delicate Arch<====>8085<====>Delicate Arch Delicate Arch is    freestanding natural arch located in Arches National Park near Moab, Utah, USA.   It is the most widely recognized landmark in Arches National Park and is depicted on Utah license plates and on a postage stamp commemorating Utah's centennial anniversary of admission to the Union in 1996.  The Olympic torch relay for the 2002 Winter Olympics passed through the arch.    HistoryBecause of its distinctive shape, the arch was known as "the Chaps" and "the Schoolmarm's Bloomers" by local cowboys.    It was given its current name by Frank Beckwith, leader of the Arches National Monument Scientific Expedition, who explored the area in the winter of 1933–1934. 

Deed poll<====>8086<====>Deed poll  A deed poll (plural: deeds poll) is a legal document binding only to a single person or several persons acting jointly to express an active intention.  It is, strictly speaking, not a contract because it binds only one party and expresses an intention instead of a promise. Use for changing name The most common use is a name change through a deed of change of name   (often referred to simply as a deed poll).  Deeds poll are used for this purpose in countries including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Hong Kong and Singapore.  In the UK, a deed poll can also be used to change a child's name, as long as everyone with parental responsibility for the child consents to it and the child does not object to it. 

Documentary film<====>8088<====>Documentary film A documentary film is a nonfictional motion picture intended to document some aspect of reality, primarily for the purposes of instruction, education, or maintaining a historical record.   Such films were originally shot on film stock—the only medium available—but now include video and digital productions that can be either direct-to-video, made into a TV show, or released for screening in cinemas.  "Documentary" has been described as a "filmmaking practice, a cinematic tradition, and mode of audience reception" that is continually evolving and is without clear boundaries.  DefinitionPolish writer and filmmaker Bolesław Matuszewski was among those who identified the mode of documentary film. 

Day of the Tentacle<====>8090<====>Day of the Tentacle   Day of the Tentacle, also known as Maniac Mansion II: Day of the Tentacle,is a 1993 graphic adventure game developed and published by LucasArts.  It is the sequel to the 1987 game Maniac Mansion.  The game's plot follows Bernard Bernoulli and his friends Hoagie and Laverne as they attempt to stop the evil Purple Tentacle—a sentient, disembodied tentacle—from taking over the world.  The player takes control of the trio and solves puzzles while using time travel to explore different periods of history. Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer co-led the game's development, their first time in such a role. 

Douglas Adams<====>8091<====>Douglas Adams Douglas Noel Adams (11 March 1952 – 11 May 2001) was an English author, scriptwriter, essayist, humorist, satirist and dramatist. Adams is best known as the author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which originated in 1978 as a BBC radio comedy before developing into a "trilogy" of five books that sold more than 15 million copies in his lifetime and generated a television series, several stage plays, comics, a computer game, and in 2005 a feature film.  Adams's contribution to UK radio is commemorated in The Radio Academy's Hall of Fame. 

Drum and bass<====>8092<====>Drum and bass  Drum and bass ( ) (also written as "drum 'n' bass" or "drum & bass"; commonly abbreviated as "D&B", "DnB" or "D'n'B") is a genre and branch of electronic music which emerged from rave and jungle scenes in England during the early 1990s.The style is often characterised by fast breakbeats (typically 160–180 beats per minute ) with heavy bass and sub-bass lines,    sampled sources, and synthesizers. The popularity of drum and bass at its commercial peak ran parallel to several other homegrown dance styles in the UK including big beat and hard house. 

Donald Knuth<====>8095<====>Donald Knuth  Donald Ervin Knuth (    ; born January 10, 1938) is an American computer scientist, mathematician, and professor emeritus at Stanford University. He is the author of the multi-volume work The Art of Computer Programming.  He contributed to the development of the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms and systematized formal mathematical techniques for it.  In the process he also popularized the asymptotic notation.  In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches of theoretical computer science, Knuth is the creator of the TeX computer typesetting system, the related METAFONT font definition language and rendering system, and the Computer Modern family of typefaces. 

Dairy product<====>8097<====>Dairy product Dairy products or milk products are a type of food produced from or containing the milk of mammals, primarily cattle, water buffaloes, goats, sheep, camels, and humans.    Dairy products include food items such as yogurt, cheese, and butter.   A facility that produces dairy products is known as a dairy, or dairy factory.  Dairy products are consumed worldwide, with the exception of much of East and Southeast Asia and also some parts of central Africa. Types of dairy products  Milk after optional homogenization, pasteurization, in several grades after standardization of the fat level, and possible addition of the bacteria Streptococcus lactis and Leuconostoc citrovorumCrème fraîche, slightly fermented creamClotted cream, thick, spoonable cream made by heating milkSingle cream, double cream and whipping creamSmetana, Central and Eastern European variety of sour creamCultured milk resembling buttermilk, but uses different yeast and bacterial culturesKefir, fermented milk drink from the Northern CaucasusKumis/Airag, slightly fermented mares' milk popular in Central AsiaPowdered milk (or milk powder), produced by removing the water from (usually skim) milkWhole milk productsButtermilk productsSkim milkWhey productsHigh milk-fat and nutritional products (for infant formulas)Cultured and confectionery productsCondensed milk, milk which has been concentrated by evaporation, with sugar added for reduced process time and longer life in an opened canKhoa, milk which has been completely concentrated by evaporation, used in Indian cuisine including gulab jamun, peda, etc.)Evaporated milk, (less concentrated than condensed) milk without added sugarRicotta, acidified whey, reduced in volumeInfant formula, dried milk powder with specific additives for feeding human infantsBaked milk, a variety of boiled milk that has been particularly popular in RussiaButter, mostly milk fat, produced by churning creamButtermilk, the liquid left over after producing butter from cream, often dried as livestock feedGhee, clarified butter, by gentle heating of butter and removal of the solid matterSmen, a fermented, clarified butter used in Moroccan cookingAnhydrous milkfat (clarified butter)Cheese, produced by coagulating milk, separating from whey and letting it ripen, generally with bacteria and sometimes also with certain moldsCurds, the soft, curdled part of milk (or skim milk) used to make cheesePaneerWhey, the liquid drained from curds and used for further processing or as a livestock feedCottage cheeseQuarkCream cheese, produced by the addition of cream to milk and then curdled to form a rich curd or cheeseFromage fraisCasein areCaseinates, sodium or calcium salts of caseinMilk protein concentrates and isolatesWhey protein concentrates and isolates, reduced lactose wheyHydrolysates, milk treated with proteolytic enzymes to alter functionalityMineral concentrates, byproduct of demineralizing wheyYogurt, milk fermented by Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sometimes with additional bacteria, such as Lactobacillus acidophilusDooghLassi, Indian subcontinentLebenClabber, milk naturally fermented to a yogurt-like stateGelato, slowly frozen milk and water, lesser fat than ice creamIce cream, slowly frozen cream, milk, flavors and emulsifying additives (dairy ice cream)Ice milk, low-fat version of ice creamFrozen custardFrozen yogurt, yogurt with emulsifiersOtherViiliKajmakFilmjölkPiimäVlaDulce de lecheSkyrJunket, milk solidified with rennetQuicheMilk ChocolateHealthDairy products can cause some issues for individuals who have lactose intolerance or a milk allergy.  Excessive consumption of dairy products can contribute significant amounts of cholesterol and saturated fat to the diet which can increase the risk of heart disease, and cause other serious health problems. There is no excess cardiovascular risk with dietary calcium intake but calcium supplements are associated with a higher risk of coronary artery calcification. Drinking milk or other dairy products does not cause mucus production, and will not make cold or asthma symptoms worse.  This widely held belief stems from some people mistaking the thin coat of residue left behind after consuming milk or ice cream for mucus. Michigan Dairy Review "Ten Common Myths about Dairy Foods Zey UstunolDept. of Food Science and Human Nutrition https://msu.edu/~mdr/vol15no2/myths.html Consumption patterns worldwideRates of dairy consumption vary widely worldwide. High-consumption countries consume more than 150 kg per capita per year: Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Costa Rica, most European counties , Israel, Kyrgyzstan, North America and Pakistan. Medium-consumption countries consume 30 to 150 kg per capita per year: India, Iran, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Mongolia, New Zealand, North and Southern Africa, most of the Middle East, and most of Latin America and the Caribbean. Low-consumption countries consume under 30 kg per capita per year: Senegal, most of Central Africa, and most of East and Southeast Asia. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, "Dairy production and products: Milk and milk products" [1]  AvoidanceSome groups avoid dairy products for non-health related reasons:Religious – Some religions restrict or do not allow for the consumption of dairy products. For example, some scholars of Jainism advocate not consuming any dairy products because dairy is perceived to involve violence against cows. Strict Judaism requires that meat and dairy products not be served at the same meal, served or cooked in the same utensils, or stored together, as prescribed in  . Vegans – Veganism is the avoidance of all animal products, including dairy products, most often due to the ethics regarding how dairy products are produced. The ethical reasons for avoiding dairy include how dairy is produced, how the animals are handled, and the environmental effect of dairy production.

Dollar<====>8100<====>Dollar  Dollar (often represented by the dollar sign $) is the name of more than twenty currencies, including (ordered by population) those of the United States, Canada, Australia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Liberia, Jamaica, and Namibia.  The U. S.  dollar is the official currency of East Timor, Ecuador, El Salvador, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Palau, the Caribbean Netherlands, U. S.  territories such as Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the United States Virgin Islands and for banknotes, Panama.  Generally, one dollar is divided into one hundred cents. HistoryOn 15 January 1520, the Czech Kingdom of Bohemia began minting coins from silver mined locally in Joachimsthal (Czech Jáchymov) and marked on reverse with the Czech lion. 

Dysprosium<====>8102<====>Dysprosium Dysprosium is a chemical element with symbol Dy and atomic number 66.  It is a rare earth element with a metallic silver luster.  Dysprosium is never found in nature as a free element, though it is found in various minerals, such as xenotime.  Naturally occurring dysprosium is composed of seven isotopes, the most abundant of which is  164 Dy. Dysprosium was first identified in 1886 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, but it was not isolated in pure form until the development of ion exchange techniques in the 1950s.  Dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements. 

Deforestation<====>8103<====>Deforestation    Deforestation, clearance, or clearing is the removal of a forest or stand of trees where the land is thereafter converted to a non-forest use.   Examples of deforestation include conversion of forestland to farms, ranches, or urban use.  The most concentrated deforestation occurs in tropical rainforests.   About 30% of Earth's land surface is covered by forests.  Deforestation occurs for multiple reasons: trees are cut down to be used for building or sold as fuel (sometimes in the form of charcoal or timber), while cleared land is used as pasture for livestock and plantation. 

Desertification<====>8104<====>Desertification Desertification is a type of land degradation in which a relatively dry area of land becomes increasingly arid, typically losing its bodies of water as well as vegetation and wildlife.  Geist (2005), p.  2  It is caused by a variety of factors, such as through climate change (particularly the current global warming) and through the overexploitation of soil through human activity.   When deserts appear automatically over the natural course of a planet's life cycle, then it can be called a natural phenomenon; however, when deserts emerge due to the rampant and unchecked depletion of nutrients in soil that are essential for it to remain arable, then a virtual "soil death" can be spoken of,  which traces its cause back to human overexploitation. 

Dumbarton Bridge (California)<====>8117<====>Dumbarton Bridge (California) The Dumbarton Bridge is the southernmost of the highway bridges across San Francisco Bay in California.  Carrying over 81,000 vehicles daily, it is the shortest bridge across San Francisco Bay at  .  Its eastern end is in Fremont, near Newark in the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge, and its western end is in Menlo Park.  Bridging State Route 84 across the bay, it has three lanes each way and a separated bike/pedestrian lane along its south side.  Like the San Mateo Bridge to the north, power lines parallel the bridge. TollsTolls are only collected from westbound traffic at the toll plaza on the east side of the bay. 

Dallas Cowboys<====>8121<====>Dallas Cowboys    The Dallas Cowboys are a professional American football team based in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex.

The team is headquartered in Frisco, Texas, and plays its home games at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, which opened for the 2009 season.  The stadium took its current name prior to the 2013 season.   The Cowboys joined the NFL as an expansion team in  .   The team's national following might best be represented by its NFL record of consecutive sell-outs. 

Denver Broncos<====>8122<====>Denver Broncos The Denver Broncos are an American football team based in Denver, Colorado.  The Broncos compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) West division.

The Broncos have played at Sports Authority Field at Mile High since  , after previously playing at Mile High Stadium from 1960 to 2000. 

D<====>8123<====>D   D (named dee   ) is the fourth letter of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet. HistoryEgyptian hieroglyph  door Phoenician  daleth Greek  Delta Etruscan  D Roman  D  O31 The Semitic letter Dāleth may have developed from the logogram for a fish or a door.  There are many different Egyptian hieroglyphs that might have inspired this.  In Semitic, Ancient Greek and Latin, the letter represented  ; in the Etruscan alphabet the letter was superfluous but still retained (see letter B). 

Delta (letter)<====>8124<====>Delta (letter)    Delta (uppercase Δ, lowercase δ or 𝛿;   délta,   ) is the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet.  In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 4.  It was derived from the Phoenician letter dalet 𐤃,  Letters that come from delta include Latin D and Cyrillic Д. A river delta (originally, the Nile River delta) is so named because its shape approximates the upper-case letter delta (the shape is a triangle).  Despite a popular legend, this use of the word delta was not coined by Herodotus. 

Digamma<====>8125<====>Digamma   Digamma, waw, or wau (uppercase: Ϝ, lowercase: ϝ, numeral: ϛ) is an archaic letter of the Greek alphabet.  It originally stood for the sound   but it has principally remained in use as a Greek numeral for 6.  Whereas it was originally called waw or wau, its most common appellation in classical Greek is digamma; as a numeral, it was called episēmon during the Byzantine era and is now known as stigma after the Byzantine ligature combining σ-τ  as ϛ. Digamma or wau was part of the original archaic Greek alphabet as initially adopted from Phoenician. 

Dose<====>8126<====>Dose Dose means quantity (in units of energy/mass) in the fields of nutrition, medicine, and toxicology.  Dosage is the rate of application of a dose, although in common and imprecise usage, the words are sometimes used synonymously. Dose can also mean quantity (in units of number/area) in the fields of Surface science and Ion implantation.

Dilbert<====>8127<====>Dilbert    Dilbert is an American comic strip written and illustrated by Scott Adams, first published on April 16, 1989.   The strip is known for its satirical office humor about a white-collar, micromanaged office featuring engineer Dilbert as the title character.  The strip has spawned dozens of books, an animated television series, a video game, and hundreds of Dilbert-themed merchandise items.  Dilbert Future and The Joy of Work are among the most read books in the series.  Adams received the National Cartoonists Society Reuben Award in 1997 and the Newspaper Comic Strip Award in the same year for his work on the strip. 

Dialect<====>8128<====>Dialect The term dialect (from Latin  ,  , from the Ancient Greek word  ,  , "discourse", from  ,  , "through" and  ,  , "I speak") is used in two distinct ways to refer to two different types of linguistic phenomena:One usage refers to a variety of a language that is a characteristic of a particular group of the language's speakers.   Under this definition, the dialects or varieties of a particular language are closely related and, despite their differences, are most often largely mutually intelligible, especially if close to one another on the dialect continuum. 

Digitalis<====>8129<====>Digitalis Digitalis (   or   ) is a genus of about 20 species of herbaceous perennials, shrubs, and biennials commonly called foxgloves. This genus was traditionally placed in the figwort family Scrophulariaceae, but recent phylogenetic research has placed it in the much enlarged family Plantaginaceae.This genus is native to western and southwestern Europe,    western and central Asia and northwestern Africa.  The scientific name means "finger-like" and refers to the ease with which a flower of Digitalis purpurea can be fitted over a human fingertip. 

Dendrite<====>8131<====>Dendrite   Dendrites (from Greek δένδρον déndron, "tree"), also dendrons, are branched protoplasmic extensions of a nerve cell that propagate the electrochemical stimulation received from other neural cells to the cell body, or soma, of the neuron from which the dendrites project.  Electrical stimulation is transmitted onto dendrites by upstream neurons (usually their axons) via synapses which are located at various points throughout the dendritic tree.  Dendrites play a critical role in integrating these synaptic inputs and in determining the extent to which action potentials are produced by the neuron.   Dendritic arborization , also known as dendritic branching, is a multi-step biological process by which neurons form new dendritic trees and branches to create new synapses. 

Dalai Lama<====>8133<====>Dalai Lama  Dalai Lama   (US);   (UK)  (Standard Tibetan: ཏཱ་ལའི་བླ་མ་, Tā la'i bla ma  ) is a title given to spiritual leaders of the Tibetan people.  They are part of the Gelug or "Yellow Hat" school of Tibetan Buddhism, the newest of the schools of Tibetan Buddhism.   The Dalai Lama title was created by Altan Khan, the Prince of Shunyi, granted by Ming Dynasty,  in 1578.The 14th and current Dalai Lama is Tenzin Gyatso. The Dalai Lama is considered to be the successor in a line of tulkus (living Buddhas, masters) who are believed  to be incarnations of Avalokiteśvara,  a Bodhisattva of Compassion. 

Damages<====>8134<====>Damages   In law, damages are an award, typically of money, to be paid to a person as compensation for loss or injury.    The rules for damages can and frequently do vary based on the type of claim which is presented (e. g. , breach of contract versus a tort claim) and the jurisdiction. At common law, damages are categorized into compensatory (or actual) damages,  and punitive damages.   Compensatory damages are further categorized into special damages, which are economic losses such as loss of earnings, property damage and medical expenses, and general damages, which are noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering and emotional distress. 

Dualism<====>8135<====>Dualism    Dualism (from the Latin word duo meaning "two")  denotes the state of two parts.  The term dualism was originally coined to denote co-eternal  binary opposition, a meaning that is preserved in metaphysical and philosophical duality discourse but has been more generalized in other usages to indicate a system which contains two essential parts. Moral dualism is the belief of the great complement of or conflict between the benevolent and the malevolent.  It simply implies that there are two moral opposites at work, independent of any interpretation of what might be "moral" and independent of how these may be represented. 

Disaster<====>8137<====>Disaster   A disaster is a serious disruption, occurring over a relatively short time, of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental loss and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources.  In contemporary academia, disasters are seen as the consequence of inappropriately managed risk.  These risks are the product of a combination of both hazards and vulnerability.  Hazards that strike in areas with low vulnerability will never become disasters, as in the case of uninhabited regions. 

Dino Zoff<====>8138<====>Dino Zoff  Dino Zoff ( ; born 28 February 1942) is a former Italian professional football goalkeeper and is the oldest winner ever of the World Cup, which he earned as captain of the Italian national team in the 1982 tournament in Spain, at the age of 40 years, 4 months and 13 days, also winning the award for best goalkeeper of the tournament, and being elected to the team of the tournament, for his performances, keeping two clean-sheets, an honour he also received after winning the 1968 European Championship on home soil; he is the only Italian player to have won both the World Cup and the European Championship.    Zoff also achieved great club success with Juventus, winning 6 Serie A titles, 2 Coppa Italia titles, and an UEFA Cup, also reaching two European Champions' Cup finals in the 1972–73 and 1982–83 seasons, as well as finishing second in the 1973 Intercontinental Cup final.Zoff was a goalkeeper of outstanding ability, and he has a place in the history of the sport among the very best in this role,being named the 3rd greatest goalkeeper of the 20th century by the IFFHS behind Lev Yashin and Gordon Banks. IFFHS' Century Elections   – rsssf.com – by Karel Stokkermans, RSSSF.  He holds the record for the longest playing time without allowing goals in international tournaments (1142 minutes) set between 1972 and 1974.  With 112 caps, he is the sixth most capped player for the Azzurri. In 2004 Pelé named him as one of the 125 greatest living footballers. In the same year, Zoff placed fifth in the UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll, and was elected as Italy's golden player of the past 50 years. He also placed second in the 1973 Ballon d'Or, as he narrowly missed out on a treble with Juventus. In 1999, Zoff placed 47th in World Soccer Magazine's 100 Greatest Players of the Twentieth Century.   After retiring as a footballer, Zoff went on to pursue a managerial career, coaching the Italian national team, with which he reached the Euro 2000 Final, and several other Italian clubs, including his former club Juventus, with which he won an UEFA Cup and a Coppa Italia double during the 1989–90 season, trophies he had also won as a player. In September 2014, Zoff published his Italian autobiography Dura Solo un Attimo la Gloria ("Glory only Lasts a Moment").   Early lifeDino Zoff was born in Mariano del Friuli, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy into a farming family. Upon his father's suggestion, Zoff initially also pursued studies to be a mechanic in case his football career proved to be unsuccessful. As a young aspiring footballer, Zoff was also interested in other sports, and his two main role models were the cyclist Fausto Coppi, and the race walker Abdon Pamich.    Club careerUdinese, Mantova and NapoliZoff's career got off to an inauspicious start, when at the age of fourteen he had trials with Inter Milan and Juventus, but was rejected due to a lack of height.  Five years later, having grown by 33 centimetres (supposedly due to his grandmother Adelaide's recommended increased daily intake of eight eggs),he made his Serie A debut with Udinese on 24 September 1961, in a 5–2 defeat to Fiorentina, although Zoff was not criticised for any of the goals he conceded.    Zoff made only four appearances in his first season for Udinese, as they were relegated to Serie B. He played the next season as the club's starting goalkeeper, helping the club to Serie A promotion, before moving to Mantova in 1963, where he spent four seasons, making 131 appearances. His performances for Mantova in the top flight caught the attention of larger clubs, while Italy's national coach at the time, Edmondo Fabbri, even considered bringing him as a back-up for the 1966 FIFA World Cup, although he ultimately chose to bring Enrico Albertosi, Roberto Anzolin, and Pierluigi Pizzaballa instead. In 1967, Zoff was transferred to Napoli, in exchange for fellow goalkeeper Claudio Bandoni, and a transfer fee of 130 million Lire; he spent five seasons in Naples, making 143 Serie A appearances with the club. During this time, he began to achieve increasing recognition in Italy, also making his International debut with the Italian national side in 1968, and earning a place in Italy's squads at Euro 68 and the 1970 World Cup.   JuventusFollowing his achievements with the national side, and due to his performances during his time with Napoli, Zoff was signed by Juventus in 1972, at the age of 30, where he resumed his success. In eleven years with Juventus, Zoff won the Serie A championship six times, the Coppa Italia twice and the UEFA Cup once, also reaching two European Cup finals, another semi-final in 1978 (during which Zoff played a decisive role in the club's shoot-out victory over Ajax in the quarter-finals by saving two penalties),    and the semi-finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup during the 1979–80 season.  In 1973, he placed second in the Ballon d'Or, following his Serie A title victory, also narrowly missing out on an historical treble with Juventus, after reaching both the European Cup and the Coppa Italia finals that season, in which his club were defeated, however; Juventus also finished as runners-up in the 1973 Intercontinental Cup that year. In winning the 1977 UEFA Cup Final against Athletic Bilbao, Zoff came out on top aginst his 'twin', the Basque goalkeeper José Ángel Iribar. Overall, Zoff made 479 appearances for Juventus in all competitions, making 330 Serie A appearances with the club (all of which came consecutively, a club record),  74 in the Coppa Italia, 71 in European Competitions, and 4 in other Club Competitions. He is currently Juventus's 6th record appearance holder in all competitions, their 7th all-time appearance holder in Serie A, their 3rd all-time appearance holder in the Coppa Italia, their 7th all-time appearance holder in UEFA Club competitions, and their 9th all-time appearance holder in international club competitions.   Zoff won his final Serie A championship with Juventus during the 1981–82 Serie A season, also winning the 1982 FIFA World Cup with Italy that year, as his team's captain. During the following 1982–83 season, the final season of his career, Dino Zoff won the Coppa Italia with defending Serie A champions Juventus, and he reached his second European Cup final with the club in 1983; Juventus were defeated 1–0 by Hamburg in Athens on 25 May, after Zoff was beaten by Felix Magath's long-distance strike; this was the final match of his career. His final league appearance came in a 4–2 home win over Genoa on 15 May 1983. Club recordsUpon retirement, Zoff held the records for the oldest Serie A player, at the age of 41, and the most Serie A appearances (570 matches) for more than 20 years, until the 2005–06 season, when the records were broken by Lazio goalkeeper Marco Ballotta, and A.C. Milan defender Paolo Maldini respectively. Behind only former A.C. Milan goalkeeper Sebastiano Rossi, who overtook him during the 1993–94 season, Zoff has conceded the fewest goals in a single Serie A season; behind only Gianluigi Buffon and Sebastiano Rossi, he has also gone the most time unbeaten in Serie A without conceding a goal, producing a 903-minute unbeaten streak during the 1972–73 season, a record that stood until Rossi overtook him in the 1993–94 season;  Buffon broke the record during the 2015–16 season.He also held the Serie A record for most consecutive clean sheets alongside Rossi (9), until Gianluigi Buffon overtook them both with his 10th consecutive clean sheet in 2016. With 570 Serie A appearances, Zoff is also the sixth highest appearance holder in Serie A of all time, and he is the fourth oldest player in Serie A to have ever played a match.  He holds the record for most consecutive matches played in Serie A (332), a streak which went unbroken from 21 May 1972 (in a 0–0 home draw with Napoli against Bologna), until his final league appearance with Juventus in 1983.  At 41 years and 86 days, Zoff is also the oldest player to have appeared in a European Cup or UEFA Champions League Final.   International careerPrior to representing the senior Italian side, Zoff had won a gold medal with the Italy under-23 side at the 1963 Mediterranean Games. On 20 April 1968, Zoff made his senior debut for Italy, playing in a 2–0 win against Bulgaria in the quarter finals of the 1968 European Championships, in Naples.    Zoff ended up being promoted to starting goalkeeper over his perceived career rival Enrico Albertosi  during the tournament, and Italy proceeded to win the European Championship on home soil, with Zoff taking home a winners' medal after only his fourth international appearance, keeping two clean sheets, and winning the award for the best goalkeeper of the tournament. Zoff was left out of the Italian starting eleven in the 1970 World Cup, however, and was Albertosi's deputy throughout the tournament, as Italy went on to reach the final of the World Cup, and was defeated 4–1 by Brazil. He returned to the starting line-up, however, ahead of Albertosi, in Italy's disappointing 1974 World Cup campaign, during which they would be eliminated in the first round.  From 1972 onwards, Zoff became Italy's undisputed number 1, and he participated in the 1978 World Cup with Italy, during which he managed a fourth-place finish, keeping 3 clean-sheets. Italy were eliminated in the semi-final, in a 2–1 loss to the Netherlands. After the match, Zoff was criticised for making a fairly uncommon error, as he was beaten by a strike from distance by Arie Haan.  Zoff was also Italy's starting goalkeeper once again at the 1980 European Championships on home soil, however, helping his side to reach the semi-finals, finishing the tournament in fourth place once again. During the 1980 European Championship, Zoff kept three clean sheets, only conceding one goal in the bronze medal match, which Italy would lose on penalties; Zoff was elected as the goalkeeper of the tournament once again, an honour he had previously managed after winning the tournament in 1968. Throughout these two tournaments, Zoff established a record for most consecutive minutes unbeaten in a European Championship, which was later beaten by Iker Casillas in 2012. Zoff had also established the record for most minutes unbeaten European Championship qualifying, which was also beaten, by compatriot Buffon in 2011. He still holds the record, however, for most consecutive minutes without conceding a goal at the European Championships including qualifying, having kept eight consecutive cleans heets between 1975 and 1980, while going unbeaten for 784 minutes. Alongside Casillas, Buffon, and Thomas Myhre, he is the goalkeeper with the fewest goals conceded in a single edition of the European Championships, having conceded only one goal in the 1968 European Championships; of these players, only Zoff and Casillas won the title while achieving this feat.Zoff's greatest accomplishment, however, came in the 1982 World Cup in Spain, where he captained Italy to victory in the tournament at the age of 40, making him the oldest ever winner of the World Cup; throughout the tournament, he kept two clean sheets, and produced a crucial goal-line save in the final minutes of the last second-round group match against favourites Brazil on 5 July, which enabled the Italians to earn a 3–2 victory and advance to the semi-finals of the competition. On 11 July, at the age of 40 years and 133 days, he became the oldest player ever to feature in a World Cup final;    following Italy's 3–1 victory over West Germany at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid, he followed in the footsteps of compatriot Gianpiero Combi (1934) as only the second goalkeeper to captain a World Cup-winning side (later Iker Casillas repeated this feat for Spain in the 2010 World Cup). Due to his performances, he was voted as the Best Goalkeeper of the Tournament. Regarding Zoff's importance during Italy's victorious World Cup campaign, his manager Enzo Bearzot said of him:   Zoff also holds the record for the longest stretch (1142 minutes) without allowing any goals in international football, set between 1972 and 1974. That clean sheet stretch was ended by Haitian player Manno Sanon's beautiful goal during the 1974 World Cup. Zoff made his final appearance for Italy on 29 May 1983, in a 2–0 away loss to Sweden, in an Euro 1984 qualifying match. At the time of his retirement, Zoff's 112 caps were the most ever by a member of the Italian national team. He currently sits in sixth place in this category, as well as second among goalkeepers, with Gianluigi Buffon having surpassed the latter record.  Style of playZoff was a traditional, effective, and experienced goalkeeper, who usually favoured efficiency and caution over flamboyance when making saves, although he was also capable of producing spectacular dives and decisive saves when necessary due to his strength and athleticism. He was particularly regarded for his outstanding positioning and handling of the ball, in particular when coming out to collect crosses, as well as his concentration, consistency, calm mindset, and composure under pressure; he also possessed good reactions and excellent shot-stopping abilities. Zoff was also noted for his attention to detail during matches, as well as his ability to read the game, anticipate his opponents, communicate with his defenders, and organise his back-line, which also enabled him to start attacking plays quickly from the back after claiming the ball. Despite his serious and reserved character, Zoff also drew praise for his leadership skills, correct behaviour, and competitive spirit, which led him to serve as captain of his national side, and enabled him to inspire a sense of calmness and confidence in his teammates. On occasion, however, Zoff was accused by certain pundits of occasionally struggling when facing long-range shots, and for not always being particularly adept at stopping penalties. Known for his work-rate in training, dedication, and discipline as a footballer, in addition to his goalkeeping skills, Zoff also stood out for his stamina, longevity, and determination, which enabled him to avoid injuries and have an extensive and highly successful career; due to his constant desire to improve himself, he was able to maintain a consistent level of performance throughout his entire career, even with his advancing age towards the end of his career, into his late 30s and early 40s.Considered one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time,in 1999 he was elected in a poll by the IFFHS as the third best goalkeeper of the 20th Century – after Lev Yashin (1st) and Gordon Banks (2nd) – as well as Italy's best keeper of the century, and the second best European keeper of the century – behind only Yashin.  Coaching careerAfter his retirement as a player, Zoff went into coaching, joining the technical staff at Juventus, initially as a goalkeeping coach, although this experienced proved to be unsatisfactory for him.  He subsequently coached the Italian Olympic side, his first experience as a coach, helping the team to qualify for the 1988 Summer Olympic Games in Seoul, before returning to Juventus in a coaching role; the Italian Olympic side eventually managed a fourth-place finish in the final tournament. Zoff served as Juventus's head coach from 1988 to 1990.  In 1990, he was sacked, however, despite winning the UEFA Cup and the Coppa Italia during the 1989–90 season, while also helping the club to a third-place finish in the league.  He then joined Lazio, where he became the coach in 1994, and later the club's sporting director, winning the Coppa Italia in 1998, and helping the club to an UEFA Cup final the same season, and was defeated by compatriots Inter.  In 1998, Zoff was appointed as the head coach of the Italian national team. Although Italy were still cautious and organised defensively, Zoff used a more open, fluid, and attacking style of play than that used by his more defensive Italian coaching predecessors Cesare Maldini and Arrigo Sacchi. Zoff helped the team to qualify for Euro 2000, and he introduced several younger players to the team, such as Francesco Totti, Gianluca Zambrotta, Stefano Fiore, Massimo Ambrosini, Christian Abbiati, Marco Delvecchio, and Vincenzo Montella.  Although Italy were not favourites, he coached a young Italy squad to a second-place finish in Euro 2000, suffering a 2–1 extra-time defeat at the hands of reigning World Cup Champions France in the final, due to a golden goal by David Trezeguet. En route to the final, a ten-man Italy had eliminated co-hosts the Netherlands in the semi-finals in a penalty shoot-out, after a 0–0 draw, following extra-time. In the final of the tournament, Italy had been 1–0 up for most of the second half, and were less than sixty seconds away from winning the tournament, before France forward Sylvain Wiltord scored in the fourth and final minute of stoppage time to equalise, and send the match into extra time. Despite reaching the final, Zoff resigned a few days later, following strong criticism from A.C. Milan president and politician Silvio Berlusconi.  Zoff was voted the World Soccer Manager of the Year in 2000. Zoff returned to defending Serie A, Coppa Italia, and Supercoppa Italiana champions Lazio as a manager for the next season, replacing Sven-Göran Eriksson in 2001, and finishing third in Serie A. The following season, he resigned on 20 September, after only the third match, due to a poor start to the 2001–02 season.  In 2005, he was named the coach of Fiorentina as a replacement for Sergio Buso. Despite saving the team from relegation on the last day of the season, Zoff was let go.Style of managementAs a manager, Zoff was known for his use of tactics based upon the zona mista system, which is a cross between the catenaccio man-marking and zonal marking systems. His teams often used a sweeper, who, in addition to his defensive duties and organisational responsibilities, was also required to start plays from the back. He preferred not to base his team's play on set plays and formations, as he believed that cultivating a good relationship with his players and fostering a winning team mentality were the keys to getting the best out of them. Personal lifeZoff is married to Annamaria Passereini; they have a son, Marco, born in 1967.    On 28 November 2015, it was reported Zoff was hospitalized for three weeks with a viral neurological infection, which made it difficult for him to walk.   On 23 December 2015, it was reported Zoff had been recovering well, however stating, "For the first time in my life, I was actually afraid... When I say scared, I wasn't afraid for myself, but for those around me. My wife, my son, my grandchildren. My tribe, basically. I would've really hurt them by leaving." He also revealed, "One night I saw two figures at the end of my bed. They had the faces of Gaetano Scirea [one of his deceased teammates] and Enzo Bearzot [one of his deceased coaches]. They were both smiling. I wasn't asleep, it wasn't a dream. I told them: 'Not yet, not now.' And I am still here."

Dipsacales<====>8141<====>Dipsacales The Dipsacales are an order of flowering plants, included within the asterid group of dicotyledons.  In the APG III system of 2009, the order includes only two families, Adoxaceae and a broadly defined Caprifoliaceae.   Some well-known members of the Dipsacales order are honeysuckle, elder, viburnum, and valerian. Under the Cronquist system, the order included Adoxaceae, Caprifoliaceae sensu stricto, Dipsacaceae, and Valerianaceae.   Under the 2003 APG II system, the circumscription of the order was much the same but the system allowed either a broadly circumscribed Caprifoliaceae including the families Diervillaceae, Dipsacaceae, Linnaeaceae, Morinaceae, and Valerianaceae, or these families being kept separate. 

December<====>8143<====>DecemberDecember is the 12th and final month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian Calendars.  It is the seventh and last month to have the length of 31 days.  December got its name from the Latin word decem (meaning ten) because it was originally the tenth month of the year in the Roman calendar, which began in March.  The winter days following December were not included as part of any month.  Later, the months of January and February were created out of the monthless period and added to the beginning of the calendar, but December retained its name.

Dante Alighieri<====>8169<====>Dante Alighieri  Dante Alighieri ( ), simply called Dante ( ,  ,  ; c.  1265 – 1321) , was a major Italian poet of the Late Middle Ages/Early Renaissance.  His Divine Comedy, originally called   (modern Italian: Commedia) and later christened   by Boccaccio, is widely considered the most important poem of the Middle Ages and the greatest literary work in the Italian language.   In the late Middle Ages, the majority of poetry was written in Latin, and therefore accessible only to affluent and educated readers.  In De vulgari eloquentia (On Eloquence in the Vernacular), however, Dante defended use of the vernacular in literature. 

Dave Brubeck<====>8176<====>Dave Brubeck  David Warren Brubeck (December 6, 1920 – December 5, 2012) was an American jazz pianist and composer, considered to be one of the foremost exponents of cool jazz.  He wrote a number of jazz standards, including "In Your Own Sweet Way" and "The Duke".  Brubeck's style ranged from refined to bombastic, reflecting his mother's attempts at classical training and his improvisational skills.  His music is known for employing unusual time signatures, and superimposing contrasting rhythms, meters, and tonalities. His long-time musical partner, alto saxophonist Paul Desmond, wrote the saxophone melody for the Dave Brubeck Quartet's best remembered piece, "Take Five",  which is in   time and has endured as a jazz classic on one of the top-selling jazz albums, Time Out. 

Dye<====>8179<====>Dye A dye is a colored substance that has an affinity to the   to which it is being applied.  The dye is generally applied in an aqueous solution, and may require a mordant to improve the fastness of the dye on the fiber.    Both dyes and pigments are colored, because they absorb only some wavelengths of visible light.  Dyes are usually soluble in water whereas  pigments are insoluble.  Some dyes can be rendered insoluble with the addition of salt to produce a lake pigment. Natural The majority of natural dyes are derived from plant sources: roots, berries, bark, leaves, and wood, fungi, and lichens. 

Examples of differential equations<====>8181<====>Examples of differential equationsDifferential equations arise in many problems in physics, engineering, and other sciences.  The following examples show how to solve differential equations in a few simple cases when an exact solution exists. Separable first-order ordinary differential equations Equations in the form  \frac {dy}{dx} = f(x)g(y)  are called separable and solved by  \frac {dy}{g(y)} = f(x)dx  and thus  \int\frac {dy}{g(y)} = \int f(x)dx .  Prior to dividing by  g(y) , one needs to check if there are stationary (also called equilibrium)solutions  y=const  satisfying  g(y)=0 . Separable (homogeneous) first-order linear ordinary differential equations A separable linear ordinary differential equation of the first order must be homogeneous and has the general form \frac{dy}{dt} + f(t) y = 0 where  f(t)  is some known function.

Dejima<====>8185<====>Dejima   ,  in old Western documents Latinised as Decima, Desjima, Dezima, Disma or Disima, was a Dutch trading post notable for being the single place of direct trade and exchange between Japan and the outside world during the Edo period. It was a small fan-shaped artificial island formed by digging a canal through a small peninsula in the bay of Nagasaki in 1634 by local merchants.  Dejima was built to constrain foreign traders.  Originally built to house Portuguese traders, it was used by the Dutch as a trading post from 1641 until 1853.  Covering an area of   or  , it was later integrated into the city through the process of land reclamation. 

Descriptive statistics<====>8187<====>Descriptive statisticsDescriptive statistics (in the count noun sense) are summary statistics that quantitatively describe or summarize features of a collection of information,  while descriptive statistics in the mass noun sense is the process of using and analyzing those statistics.  Descriptive statistics is distinguished from inferential statistics (or inductive statistics), in that descriptive statistics aims to summarize a sample, rather than use the data to learn about the population that the sample of data is thought to represent.  This generally means that descriptive statistics, unlike inferential statistics, is not developed on the basis of probability theory.    Even when a data analysis draws its main conclusions using inferential statistics, descriptive statistics are generally also presented. 

Demographic statistics<====>8189<====>Demographic statistics  Among the kindsof data that national leaders need are the demographic statistics of their population.  Records of births, deaths, marriages, immigration and emigration and a regular census of population provide information that is key to making sound decisions about national policy. A useful summary of such data is the population pyramid.  It provides data about the sex and age distribution of the population in an accessible graphical format. Another summary is called the life table.  For a cohort of persons born in the same year, it traces and projects their life experiences from birth to death. 

Detective fiction<====>8192<====>Detective fiction  Detective fiction is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detective—either professional, amateur or retired—investigates a crime, often murder.  The detective genre began around the same time as speculative fiction and other genre fiction in the mid-nineteenth century and has remained extremely popular, particularly in novels.  Some of the most famous heroes of detective fiction include C.  Auguste Dupin, Sherlock Holmes, and Hercule Poirot.  Juvenile stories featuring The Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, and The Boxcar Children have also remained in print for several decades. Beginnings of detective fictionIn ancient literatureSome scholars  have suggested that certain ancient and religious texts bear similarities to what would later be called detective fiction.

Diatonic scale<====>8202<====>Diatonic scale  In western music theory, a diatonic scale is a heptatonic scale that includes five whole steps (whole tones) and two half steps (semitones) in each octave, in which the two half steps are separated from each other by either two or three whole steps, depending on their position in the scale.  This pattern ensures that, in a diatonic scale spanning more than one octave, all the half steps are maximally separated from each other (i. e.  separated by at least two whole steps).  The word "diatonic" comes from the Greek  , meaning progressing through tones. 

Deutschlandlied<====>8203<====>Deutschlandlied    The " " (English: "Song of Germany",  ; also known as " ", or "The Song of the Germans"), or part of it, has been the national anthem of Germany since 1922, except in East Germany, whose anthem was "Auferstanden aus Ruinen" ("Risen from Ruins") from 1949 to 1990. Since World War II and the fall of Nazi Germany, only the third stanza has been used as the national anthem.

HM Prison Dartmoor<====>8206<====>HM Prison Dartmoor   HM Prison Dartmoor is a Category C men's prison, located in Princetown, high on Dartmoor in the English county of Devon.  Its high granite walls dominate this area of the moor.  The prison is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall, and is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. HistoryIn 1805, Great Britain was at war with Napoleonic France, a conflict during which thousands of prisoners were taken and confined in prison "hulks" or derelict ships.  This was considered unsafe, partially due to the proximity of the Royal Naval dockyard at Devonport (then called Plymouth Dock), and as living conditions were appalling in the extreme, a prisoner of war depot was planned in the remote isolation of Dartmoor. 

Dilation and curettage<====>8207<====>Dilation and curettage  Dilation (or dilatation) and curettage (D&C) refers to the dilation (widening/opening) of the cervix and surgical removal of part of the lining of the uterus and/or contents of the uterus by scraping and scooping (curettage).  It is a therapeutic gynecological procedure as well as the most often used method of first trimester miscarriage or abortion. D&C normally refers to a procedure involving a curette, also called sharp curettage.   However, some sources use the term D&C to refer more generally to any procedure that involves the processes of dilation and removal of uterine contents, which includes the more common suction curettage procedures of manual and electric vacuum aspiration. 

Doctor Who<====>8209<====>Doctor WhoDoctor Who is a British science-fiction television programme produced by the BBC since 1963.

Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired.  Accompanied by a number of companions, the Doctor combats a variety of foes, while working to save civilisations  and help people in need. 

Democritus<====>8211<====>Democritus   Democritus ( ;  , Dēmókritos, meaning "chosen of the people";    ) was an Ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher primarily remembered today for his formulation of an atomic theory of the universe.  Barnes (1987).  Democritus was born in Abdera, Thrace, Russell, pp.  64–65.   around 460 BC, although some thought it was 490 BC.  His exact contributions are difficult to disentangle from those of his mentor Leucippus, as they are often mentioned together in texts.  Their speculation on atoms, taken from Leucippus, bears a passing and partial resemblance to the 19th-century understanding of atomic structure that has led some to regard Democritus as more of a scientist than other Greek philosophers; however, their ideas rested on very different bases. 

Disc golf<====>8212<====>Disc golf Disc golf   (also called Frisbee Golf  or sometimes Frolf ) is a flying disc sport in which players throw a disc at a target, and is played using rules similar to golf.It is often played on a course of 9 or 18 holes, but other formats are common.

Players seek to complete a course in the lowest number of total throws. 

Decimal<====>8214<====>Decimal   The decimal numeral system (also called base-ten positional numeral system, and occasionally called denary) is the standard system for denoting integer and non-integer numbers.  It is the extension to non-integer numbers of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system.   The way of denoting numbers in the decimal system is often referred to as Decimal notation.  A decimal numeral, or just decimal, or, improperly decimal number, refers generally to the notation of a number in the decimal system, which contains a decimal separator (for example 10. 00 or 3. 14159).  Sometimes these terms are used for any numeral in the decimal system.

They are almost always referred to as just "the Dorians", as they are called in the earliest literary mention of them in the Odyssey,  where they already can be found inhabiting the island of Crete. They were diverse in way of life and social organization, varying from the populous trade center of the city of Corinth, known for its ornate style in art and architecture, to the isolationist, military state of Sparta.

Dice<====>8244<====>Dice Dice (singular die or dice;  from Old French dé; from Latin datum "something which is given or played" ) are small throwable objects with multiple resting positions, used for generating random numbers.  Dice are suitable as gambling devices for games like craps and are also used in non-gambling tabletop games. A traditional die is a cube, with each of its six faces showing a different number of dots (pips) from 1 to 6.  When thrown or rolled, the die comes to rest showing on its upper surface a random integer from one to six, each value being equally likely. 

Dumpster diving<====>8246<====>Dumpster diving  Dumpster diving, commonly referred to in the UK and many parts of Europe as totting,    skipping, skip diving or skip salvage,  is a popular form of modern salvaging of waste in large commercial, residential, industrial and construction containers to find items that have been discarded by their owners, but that may prove useful to the picker.  It is not confined to dumpsters specifically, and may cover standard household waste containers, landfills or small dumps. Different terms are used to refer to different forms of this activity.   For picking materials from the curbside trash collection, curb shopping, trash picking or street scavenging are sometimes used. 

Digital synthesizer<====>8247<====>Digital synthesizerA digital synthesizer is a synthesizer that uses digital signal processing (DSP) techniques to make musical sounds.  This in contrast to older analog synthesizers, which produce music using analog electronics, and samplers, which play back digital recordings of acoustic, electric, or electronic instruments.  Some digital synthesizers emulate analog synthesizers others include sampling capability in addition to digital synthesis. HistoryThe very earliest digital synthesis experiments were made with computers, as part of academic research into sound generation.  In 1973,    the Japanese company Yamaha licensed the algorithms for frequency modulation synthesis (FM synthesis) from John Chowning, who had experimented with it at Stanford University since 1971.

"Explications of the concept of music usually begin with the idea that music is organized sound.  They go on to note that this characterization is too broad, since there are many examples of organized sound that are not music, such as human speech, and the sounds non-human animals and machines make"  .  Many authorities have suggested definitions, but defining music turns out to be more difficult than might first be imagined. 

Dayton, Ohio<====>8253<====>Dayton, Ohio   Dayton ( ) is the sixth-largest city in the state of Ohio and is the county seat of Montgomery County.  A small portion of the city extends into Greene County.In the 2010 census, the population was 141,759, and the Dayton metropolitan area had 799,232 residents, making it Ohio's fourth-largest metropolitan area, after Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Columbus and the 63rd-largest in the United States.The Dayton-Springfield-Greenville Combined Statistical Area had a population of 1,080,044 in 2010, making it the 43rd-largest in the United States. 

Diode<====>8254<====>Diode A diode is a two-terminal electronic component that conducts current primarily in one direction (asymmetric conductance); it has low (ideally zero) resistance in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other.  A semiconductor diode, the most common type today, is a crystalline piece of semiconductor material with a p–n junction connected to two electrical terminals.   A vacuum tube diode has two electrodes, a plate (anode) and a heated cathode.  Semiconductor diodes were the first semiconductor electronic devices.  The discovery of crystals' rectifying abilities was made by German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1874.

Daedalus<====>8258<====>Daedalus In Greek mythology, Daedalus ( ;   Daidalos "cunningly wrought", perhaps related to δαιδάλλω "to work artfully";   ; Etruscan: Taitale) was a skillful craftsman and artist.    He is the father of Icarus, the uncle of Perdix, and possibly also the father of Iapyx, although this is unclear. FamilyHis parentage was supplied as a later addition to the mythos, providing him with a father in Metion,  Eupalamus,  or Palamaon,  and a mother, Alcippe,  Iphinoe,  or Phrasmede.   Daedalus had two sons: Icarus  and Iapyx,  along with a nephew either Talus or Perdix. 

Deception Pass<====>8259<====>Deception Pass Deception Pass is a strait separating Whidbey Island from Fidalgo Island, in the northwest part of the U. S.  state of Washington.  It connects Skagit Bay, part of Puget Sound, with the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  A pair of bridges known collectively as Deception Pass Bridge cross Deception Pass, and the bridges are on the National Register of Historic Places. HistoryThe Deception Pass area has been home to various Coast Salish tribes for thousands of years.  The first Europeans to see Deception Pass were members of the 1790 expedition of Manuel Quimper on the Princesa Real. 

Dominoes<====>8262<====>Dominoes   Dominoes is a family of boardgames played with rectangular "domino" tiles.   Each domino is a rectangular tile with a line dividing its face into two square ends.  Each end is marked with a number of spots (also called pips, nips, or dobs) or is blank.  The backs of the dominoes in a set are indistinguishable, either blank or having some common design.  The domino gaming pieces (colloquially nicknamed bones, cards, tiles, tickets, stones, chips, or spinners ) make up a domino set, sometimes called a deck or pack.   The traditional Sino-European domino set consists of 28 dominoes, featuring all combinations of spot counts between zero and six. 

Dissociation constant<====>8263<====>Dissociation constantIn chemistry, biochemistry, and pharmacology, a dissociation constant ( K_d ) is a specific type of equilibrium constant that measures the propensity of a larger object to separate (dissociate) reversibly into smaller components, as when a complex falls apart into its component molecules, or when a salt splits up into its component ions.   The dissociation constant is the inverse of the association constant.  In the special case of salts, the dissociation constant can also be called an ionization constant.  For a general reaction: {A}_\mathit{x}{B}_\mathit{y}   \mathit{x}{A} + \mathit{y}{B} in which a complex  \ce{A}_x \ce{B}_y  breaks down into x A subunits and y B subunits, the dissociation constant is defined K_d = \frac{[\ce A]^x [\ce B]^y}{[\ce A_x \ce B_y]} where [A], [B], and [A x B y ] are the concentrations of A, B, and the complex A x B y , respectively. 

Dimensional analysis<====>8267<====>Dimensional analysisIn engineering and science, dimensional analysis is the analysis of the relationships between different physical quantities by identifying their base quantities (such as length, mass, time, and electric charge) and units of measure (such as miles vs.  kilometers, or pounds vs.  kilograms vs.  grams) and tracking these dimensions as calculations or comparisons are performed.   Converting from one dimensional unit to another is often somewhat complex.  Dimensional analysis, or more specifically the factor-label method, also known as the unit-factor method, is a widely used technique for such conversions using the rules of algebra.    The concept of physical dimension was introduced by Joseph Fourier in 1822.

Constantius allows him to live as a private citizen on a state pension. 508 – Clovis I, king of the Franks, is baptized into the Catholic faith at Reims, by Saint Remigius. 

Digital television<====>8271<====>Digital television    Digital television (DTV) is the transmission of television signals, including the sound channel, using digital encoding, in contrast to the earlier television technology, analog television, in which the video and audio are carried by analog signals.   It is an innovative advance that represents the first significant evolution in television technology since color television in the 1950s.    Digital TV can transmit multiple channels in the same bandwidth occupied by a single channel of analog television,  and provides many new features that analog television cannot.   A switchover from analog to digital broadcasting began around 2006 in some countries, and many industrial countries have now completed the changeover, while other countries are in various stages of adaptation. 

Declaration of Arbroath<====>8274<====>Declaration of Arbroath The Declaration of Arbroath is a declaration of Scottish independence, made in 1320.  It is in the form of a letter in Latin submitted to Pope John XXII, dated 6 April 1320, intended to confirm Scotland's status as an independent, sovereign state and defending Scotland's right to use military action when unjustly attacked. Generally believed to have been written in the Arbroath Abbey by Bernard of Kilwinning, then Chancellor of Scotland and Abbot of Arbroath,  and sealed by fifty-one magnates and nobles, the letter is the sole survivor of three created at the time.  The others were a letter from the King of Scots, Robert I, and a letter from four Scottish bishops which all presumably made similar points. 

Digital data<====>8276<====>Digital data Digital data, in information theory and information systems, are discrete, discontinuous representations of information or works, as contrasted with continuous, or analog signals which behave in a continuous manner, or represent information using a continuous function. Although digital representations are the subject matter of discrete mathematics, the information represented can be either discrete, such as numbers and letters, or it can be continuous, such as sounds, images, and other measurements. The word digital comes from the same source as the words digit and digitus (the Latin word for finger), as fingers are often used for discrete counting.  Mathematician George Stibitz of Bell Telephone Laboratories used the word digital in reference to the fast electric pulses emitted by a device designed to aim and fire anti-aircraft guns in 1942. 

Demon<====>8280<====>Demon    A demon (from Koine Greek   daimónion) is a supernatural and often malevolent being prevalent in religion, occultism, literature, fiction, mythology and folklore. In Ancient Near Eastern religions as well as in the Abrahamic traditions, including ancient and medieval Christian demonology, a demon is considered a harmful spiritual entity, below the heavenly planes  which may cause demonic possession, calling for an exorcism.  In Western occultism and Renaissance magic, which grew out of an amalgamation of Greco-Roman magic, Jewish Aggadah and Christian demonology,  a demon is believed to be a spiritual entity that may be conjured and controlled. 

Domino effect<====>8286<====>Domino effect A domino effect or chain reaction is the cumulative effect produced when one event sets off a chain of similar events.   The term is best known as a mechanical effect, and is used as an analogy to a falling row of dominoes.  It typically refers to a linked sequence of events where the time between successive events is relatively small.  It can be used literally (an observed series of actual collisions) or metaphorically (causal linkages within systems such as global finance or politics).  The term domino effect is used both to imply that an event is inevitable or highly likely (it's already started to happen), and conversely to imply that an event is impossible or highly unlikely (the one domino left standing). 

Diffusion pump<====>8293<====>Diffusion pumpDiffusion pumps use a high speed jet of vapor to direct gas molecules in the pump throat down into the bottom of the pump and out the exhaust.  Invented in 1915 by Wolfgang Gaede  using mercury vapor, and improved by Irving Langmuir and W.  Crawford, they were the first type of high vacuum pumps operating in the regime of free molecular flow, where the movement of the gas molecules can be better understood as diffusion than by conventional fluid dynamics.  Gaede used the name diffusion pump since his design was based on the finding that gas cannot diffuse against the vapor stream, but will be carried with it to the exhaust. 

Domenico Alberti<====>8299<====>Domenico AlbertiDomenico Alberti (c.  1710 – 14 October 1740) was an Italian singer, harpsichordist, and composer. Alberti was born in Venice    and studied music with Antonio Lotti.  He wrote operas, songs, and sonatas for keyboard instruments, for which he is best known today.  These sonatas frequently employ arpeggiated accompaniment in the left hand in one of several patterns that are now collectively known as Alberti bass.  Alberti was one of the earliest composers to use these patterns, but was not the first or only.   The most well-known of these patterns consists of regular broken chords, with the lowest note sounding first, then the highest, then the middle and then the highest again. 

Doris Day<====>8300<====>Doris Day   Doris Day (born Doris Mary Ann Kappelhoff; April 3, 1922) is an American actress, singer, and animal welfare activist.  After she began her career as a big band singer in 1939, her popularity increased with her first hit recording "Sentimental Journey" (1945).  After leaving Les Brown & His Band of Renown to embark on a solo career, she recorded more than 650 songs from 1947 to 1967, which made her one of the most popular and acclaimed singers of the 20th century. Day's film career began with the 1948 film Romance on the High Seas, and its success sparked her twenty-year career as a motion picture actress. 

Distillation<====>8301<====>DistillationDistillation is the process of separating the components or substances from a liquid mixture by selective boiling  and condensation.  Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components), or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components of the mixture.  In either case the process exploits differences in the volatility of the mixture's components.  In industrial chemistry, distillation is a unit operation of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process and not a chemical reaction. Commercially, distillation has many applications.  For example:In the fossil fuel industry, distillation is a major class of operation at oil refineries for transforming crude oil into fuels and chemical feed stocks. 

David Hilbert<====>8302<====>David Hilbert  David Hilbert  ( ; 23 January 1862 – 14 February 1943) was a German mathematician.  He is recognized as one of the most influential and universal mathematicians of the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Hilbert discovered and developed a broad range of fundamental ideas in many areas, including invariant theory and the axiomatization of geometry.  He also formulated the theory of Hilbert spaces,  one of the foundations of functional analysis. Hilbert adopted and warmly defended Georg Cantor's set theory and transfinite numbers.  A famous example of his leadership in mathematics is his 1900 presentation of a collection of problems that set the course for much of the mathematical research of the 20th century. 

Down syndrome<====>8303<====>Down syndromeDown syndrome (DS or DNS), also known as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21.It is typically associated with physical growth delays, characteristic facial features and mild to moderate intellectual disability.The average IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental ability of an 8- or 9-year-old child, but this can vary widely.   The parents of the affected individual are typically genetically normal. 

Dyslexia<====>8305<====>DyslexiaDyslexia, also known as reading disorder, is characterized by trouble with reading despite normal intelligence. Different people are affected to varying degrees.   Problems may include difficulties in spelling words, reading quickly, writing words, "sounding out" words in the head, pronouncing words when reading aloud and understanding what one reads.    Often these difficulties are first noticed at school.   When someone who previously could read loses their ability, it is known as alexia.   The difficulties are involuntary and people with this disorder have a normal desire to learn. 

Delft<====>8308<====>Delft{{Infobox settlement  }}Delft ( ) is a city and municipality in the European country of the Netherlands.  There it is located in the province of South Holland.  Delft is popular tourist attraction in the country.  It is home to Delft University of Technology ("TU Delft"), regarded as center of technological research and development in the Netherlands, Delft Blue pottery and the currently reigning House of Orange-Nassau. Delft is located roughly between Rotterdam, to the south, and The Hague, to the north.  Together with them, it is part of both Rotterdam–The Hague Metropolitan Area and the Randstad. 

Duesberg hypothesis<====>8309<====>Duesberg hypothesis  The Duesberg hypothesis is the claim, associated with University of California, Berkeley professor Peter Duesberg, that various noninfectious factors such as but not limited to, recreational and pharmaceutical drug use are the cause of AIDS, and that HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is merely a harmless passenger virus.   The most prominent supporters of this hypothesis are Duesberg himself, biochemist and vitamin proponent David Rasnick, and journalist Celia Farber.  The scientific community contends that Duesberg's arguments are the result of cherry-picking predominantly outdated scientific data  and selectively ignoring evidence in favor of HIV's role in AIDS. 

Dinosaur<====>8311<====>Dinosaur    Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles  of the clade Dinosauria.  They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 231 million years ago,    although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research.They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201 million years ago; their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.  The fossil record indicates that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs,    having evolved from earlier theropods during the late Jurassic Period. 

Diamagnetism<====>8315<====>DiamagnetismDiamagnetic materials are repelled by a magnetic field; an applied magnetic field creates an induced magnetic field in them in the opposite direction, causing a repulsive force.   In contrast, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic materials are attracted by a magnetic field.   Diamagnetism is a quantum mechanical effect that occurs in all materials; when it is the only contribution to the magnetism, the material is called diamagnetic.In paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances the weak diamagnetic force is overcome by the attractive force of magnetic dipoles in the material.   The magnetic permeability of diamagnetic materials is less than μ 0 , the permeability of vacuum. 

Duke of Marlborough (title)<====>8317<====>Duke of Marlborough (title)  Duke of Marlborough (   ) is a title in the Peerage of England.  It was created by Queen Anne in 1702 for John Churchill, 1st Earl of Marlborough (1650–1722), the noted military leader.  In historical text, it is often to him that an unqualified use of the title refers.  The name of the dukedom refers to Marlborough in Wiltshire.  It is one of the few titles in the peerage which allows for suo jure female inheritance, and the only current dukedom to do so. The earldom of Marlborough was held by the family of Ley from its creation 1626 until its extinction with the death of the 4th earl in 1679.

Difference engine<====>8324<====>Difference engine A difference engine is an automatic mechanical calculator designed to tabulate polynomial functions.  The name derives from the method of divided differences, a way to interpolate or tabulate functions by using a small set of polynomial coefficients.  Most mathematical functions commonly used by engineers, scientists and navigators, including logarithmic and trigonometric functions, can be approximated by polynomials, so a difference engine can compute many useful tables of numbers. The historical difficulty in producing error-free tables by teams of mathematicians and human "computers" spurred Charles Babbage's desire to build a mechanism to automate the process. History J. 

Draupnir<====>8326<====>Draupnir In Norse mythology, Draupnir (Old Norse "the dripper" Orchard (1997:34).  ) is a gold ring possessed by the god Odin with the ability to multiply itself: Every ninth night, eight new rings 'drip' from Draupnir, each one of the same size and weight as the original. Draupnir was forged by the dwarven brothers Brokkr and Eitri (or Sindri).  Brokkr and Eitri made this ring as one of a set of three gifts which included Mjöllnir and Gullinbursti.  They made these gifts in accordance with a wager Loki made saying that Brokk and Eitri could not make better gifts than the three made by the Sons of Ivaldi. 

Divergence<====>8328<====>Divergence  In vector calculus, divergence is a vector operator that produces a scalar field, giving the quantity of a vector field's source at each point.  More technically, the divergence represents the volume density of the outward flux of a vector field from an infinitesimal volume around a given point. As an example, consider air as it is heated or cooled.  The velocity of the air at each point defines a vector field.  While air is heated in a region, it expands in all directions, and thus the velocity field points outward from that region.  The divergence of the velocity field in that region would thus have a positive value.

Decision problem<====>8336<====>Decision problem In computability theory and computational complexity theory, a decision problem is a problem that can be posed as a yes-no question of the input values.  Decision problems typically appear in mathematical questions of decidability, that is, the question of the existence of an effective method to determine the existence of some object or its membership in a set; some of the most important problems in mathematics are undecidable. For example, the problem "given two numbers x and y, does x evenly divide y?" is a decision problem.   The answer can be either 'yes' or 'no', and depends upon the values of x and y. 

Domain Name System<====>8339<====>Domain Name System  The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network.  It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.  Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols.  By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality on the Internet, that has been in use since 1985.

David Janssen<====>8343<====>David Janssen  David Janssen (born David Harold Meyer, March 27, 1931 – February 13, 1980) was an American film and television actor who is best known for his starring role as Dr.  Richard Kimble in the television series The Fugitive (1963–1967).  Janssen also had the title roles in three other series: Richard Diamond, Private Detective; Harry O; and O'Hara, U. S.  Treasury. In 1996 TV Guide ranked him number 36 on its 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time list.    Early lifeJanssen was born in 1931 in Naponee, a village in Franklin County in southern Nebraska, to Harold Edward Meyer, a banker (May 12, 1906 – November 4, 1990) and Berniece Graf (May 11, 1910 – November 26, 1995). 

Docetism<====>8344<====>Docetism In Christianity, docetism (from the Greek   dokeĩn (to seem) dókēsis (apparition, phantom),   is the doctrine that the phenomenon of Christ, his historical and bodily existence, and above all the human form of Jesus, was mere semblance without any true reality.    Broadly it is taken as the belief that Jesus only seemed to be human, and that his human form was an illusion.  The word   Dokētaí (illusionists) referring to early groups who denied Jesus' humanity, first occurred in a letter by Bishop Serapion of Antioch (197–203),  who discovered the doctrine in the Gospel of Peter, during a pastoral visit to a Christian community using it in Rhosus, and later condemned it as a forgery. 

Greek drachma<====>8347<====>Greek drachma   Drachma (   ,  ;  pl.  drachmae or drachmas) was the currency used in Greece during several periods in its history:An ancient Greek currency unit issued by many Greek city states during a period of ten centuries, from the Archaic period throughout the Classical period, the Hellenistic period up to the Roman period under Greek Imperial Coinage. Three modern Greek currencies, the first introduced in 1832 and the last replaced by the euro in 2001 (at the rate of 340. 75 drachma to the euro).  The euro did not begin circulating until 2002 but the exchange rate was fixed on 19 June 2000, with legal introduction of the euro taking place in January 2002. 

Denarius<====>8349<====>Denarius  In the Roman currency system, the dēnārius (pronunciation:  ;dēnāriī (pronunciation:  ) was a small silver coin first minted about 211 BC during the Second Punic War.   It became the most common coin produced for circulation but was slowly debased in weight and silver content until its replacement by the double denarius, called the antoninianus, early in the 3rd century AD.  The word dēnārius is derived from the Latin dēnī "containing ten", as its value was 10 assēs, although in the middle of the 2nd century BC it was recalibrated so that it was now worth sixteen assēs or four sēstertiī. 

Della Rovere<====>8350<====>Della Rovere  The Della Rovere family ( ; literally "of the Oak Tree") is a noble family of Italy.  Coming from modest beginnings in Savona, Liguria, the family rose to prominence through nepotism and ambitious marriages arranged by two della Rovere popes, Francesco della Rovere, who ruled as Pope Sixtus IV (1471–1484) and his nephew Giuliano (Pope Julius II, 1503–1513).   Pope Sixtus IV built the Sistine Chapel, which is named for him.  The Basilica San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome is the family church of the della Rovere. Guidobaldo da Montefeltro adopted Francesco Maria I della Rovere, his sister's child and nephew of Pope Julius II.

Definable real number<====>8361<====>Definable real numberDefinable real numbers are those that can be uniquely specified by a description.   The description may be expressed as a construction or as a formula of a formal language.  For example, the positive square root of 2,  \sqrt{2} , can be defined as the unique positive solution to the equation  x^2  = 2 , and it can be constructed with a compass and straightedge. Different notions of description give rise to different notions of definability.   Specific varieties of definable numbers include the  constructible numbers of geometry, the algebraic numbers, and the computable numbers. 

Diego de Almagro<====>8362<====>Diego de Almagro  Diego de Almagro, (   –  July 8, 1538), also known as El Adelantado and El Viejo, was a Spanish conquistador and a companion.  Later was a rival of Francisco Pizarro.  He participated in the Spanish conquest of Peru and was credited as the first European discoverer of Chile.  Later, Almagro lost his left eye battling with coastal natives in the New World.  In 1525 he joined the Pizarro brothers and Hernándo de Luque at Panama for the conquest of Peru. Early yearsDiego de Almagro was born and raised in Almagro, Ciudad Real, Spain with parents Juan de Montenegro and Elvira Gutiérrez. 

Divinity<====>8363<====>Divinity In religion, divinity or godhead is the state of things that are believed to come from a supernatural power or deity, such as a god, supreme being, creator deity, or spirits, and are therefore regarded as sacred and holy.  Wiktionary: "divine (comparative more divine, superlative most divine)1) of or pertaining to a god2) eternal, holy, or otherwise supernatural3) of superhuman or surpassing excellence4) beautiful, heavenly  divine - Dictionary. com.   Such things are regarded as divine due to their transcendental origins or because their attributes or qualities are superior or supreme relative to things of the Earth. 

Depth of field<====>8367<====>Depth of field In optics, particularly as it relates to film and photography, depth of field (DOF), also called focus range or effective focus range, is the distance between the nearest and farthest objects in a scene that appear acceptably sharp in an image.  Although a lens can precisely focus at only one distance at a time, the decrease in sharpness is gradual on each side of the focused distance, so that within the DOF, the unsharpness is imperceptible under normal viewing conditions. In some cases, it may be desirable to have the entire image sharp, and a large DOF is appropriate. 

Dumnonii<====>8368<====>Dumnonii  The Dumnonii or Dumnones were a British tribe who inhabited Dumnonia, the area now known as Devon and Cornwall (and some areas of present-day Dorset and Somerset) in the further parts of the South West peninsula of Britain, from at least the Iron Age up to the early Saxon period.  They were bordered to the east by the Durotriges tribe. EtymologyWilliam Camden, in his 1607 edition of Britannia, describes Cornwall and Devon as being two parts of the same 'country' which: Camden had learnt some Welsh during the course of his studies and it would appear that he is the origin of the interpretation of Dumnonii as "deep valley dwellers" from his understanding of the Welsh of his time. 

Declaration of independence<====>8372<====>Declaration of independence   A declaration of independence or declaration of statehood is an assertion by a defined territory that it is independent and constitutes a state.  Such places are usually declared from part or all of the   of another nation or failed nation, or are breakaway territories from within the larger state.  In 2010, the UN's International Court of Justice ruled in an advisory opinion in Kosovo that "International law contains no prohibition on declarations of independence",    though the state from which the territory wishes to secede may regard the declaration as rebellion, which may lead to a war of independence or a constitutional settlement to resolve the crisis. 

Drag racing<====>8373<====>Drag racing  Drag racing is a type of motor racing in which automobiles or motorcycles (usually specially prepared for the purpose) compete, usually two at a time, to be first to cross a set finish line.  The race follows a short, straight course from a standing start over a measured distance, most commonly ¼ mile ( ), with a shorter ( ) becoming increasingly popular, as it has become the standard for nitromethane-fuelled Top Fuel dragsters and funny cars, where some major bracket races and other sanctioning bodies have adopted it as the standard, while the ⅛ mi ( _ is also popular in some circles. 

Draugr<====>8375<====>Draugr  The draugr or draug ( , plural  ; modern  ,   and Danish, Swedish, and  ), also called   , literally "again-walker" ( ) is an undead creature from Norse mythology. The word draugr can be traced to a Proto-Indo European stem *  "phantom", from *  "deceive".    The Old Norse meaning of the word is a revenant.  The will appears to be strong, strong enough to draw the hugr [animate will] back to one's body.  These reanimated individuals were known as draugar.  However, though the dead might live again, they could also die again. 

Day<====>8376<====>Day  A day, a unit of time, is approximately the period of time during which the Earth completes one rotation with respect to the Sun (solar day). In 1960, the second was redefined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth in year 1900, and was designated the SI base unit of time.  The unit of measurement "day", was redefined as 86 400 SI seconds and symbolized d.  In 1967, the second and so the day were redefined by atomic electron transition.A civil day is usually 86 400 seconds, plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time. 

Database<====>8377<====>Database  A database is an organized collection of data.    A relational database, more restrictively, is a collection of schemas, tables, queries, reports, views, and other elements. Database designers typically organize the data to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information, such as (for example) modelling the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies. A database-management system (DBMS) is a computer-software application that interacts with end-users, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data.  A general-purpose DBMS allows the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases. 

Dipole<====>8378<====>Dipole In electromagnetism, there are two kinds of dipoles:An electric dipole is a separation of positive and negative charges.  The simplest example of this is a pair of electric charges of equal magnitude but opposite sign, separated by some (usually small) distance.  A permanent electric dipole is called an electret. A magnetic dipole is a closed circulation of electric current.  A simple example of this is a single loop of wire with some constant current through it.   Dipoles can be characterized by their dipole moment, a vector quantity.  For the simple electric dipole given above, the electric dipole moment points from the negative charge towards the positive charge, and has a magnitude equal to the strength of each charge times the separation between the charges. 

Draught beer<====>8387<====>Draught beer   Draught beer, also spelt  draft,  is beer served from a cask or keg rather than from a bottle or can.  Draught beer served from a pressurised keg is also known as   NameUntil Joseph Bramah patented the beer engine in 1785, beer was served directly from the barrel and carried to the customer.  The Old English   ("carry; pull") developed into a series of related words including drag, draw, and draught.  By the time Bramah's beer pumps became popular, the use of the term draught to refer to the acts of serving or drinking beer was well established and transferred easily to beer served via the hand pumps. 

Major depressive disorder<====>8389<====>Major depressive disorderMajor depressive disorder (MDD), also known simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by at least two weeks of low mood that is present across most situations.   It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause.   People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or hear things that others cannot.   Some people have periods of depression separated by years in which they are normal while others nearly always have symptoms present.   Major depressive disorder can negatively affect a person's personal, work, or school life, as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health. 

Diana (mythology)<====>8391<====>Diana (mythology) Diana (Classical Latin:  ) was the goddess of the hunt, the moon, and nature in Roman mythology, associated with wild animals and woodland, and having the power to talk to and control animals.  She was equated with the Greek goddess Artemis, Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia, The Book People, Haydock, 1995, p.  215.   though she had an independent origin in Italy. Diana was known as the virgin goddess of childbirth and women.  She was one of the three maiden goddesses, along with Minerva and Vesta, who swore never to marry.  Oak groves and deer were especially sacred to her.

Among his honours are four Academy Award nominations, a Grammy for Batman,  an Emmy for Desperate Housewives, , six Saturn Awards for Best Music, the 2002 Richard Kirk Award,  and the Disney Legend Award. 

Dimension<====>8398<====>Dimension In physics and mathematics, the dimension of a mathematical space (or object) is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it.    Thus a line has a dimension of one because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on it for example, the point at 5 on a number line.  A surface such as a plane or the surface of a cylinder or sphere has a dimension of two because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on it for example, both a latitude and longitude are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere.

Duodecimal<====>8400<====>Duodecimal   The duodecimal system (also known as base 12 or dozenal) is a positional notation numeral system using twelve as its base.  In this system, the number ten may be written by a rotated "2" ( 2 ) and the number eleven by a rotated "3" ( 3 ).  This notation was introduced by Sir Isaac Pitman.   These digit forms are available as Unicode characters on computerized systems since June 2015    as ↊ (Code point 218A) and ↋ (Code point 218B), respectively.   Other notations use "A", "T", or "X" for ten and "B" or "E" for eleven. 

David Hayes Agnew<====>8401<====>David Hayes Agnew David Hayes Agnew (November 24, 1818 March 22, 1892) was an American surgeon. BiographyAgnew was born on November 24, 1818, Nobleville, Pennsylvania, (present-day Christiana).  His parents were Robert Agnew and Agnes Noble.  Agnew grew up as a Christian.  He was surrounded by a family of doctors and had always known he was going to become a physician.  “From the time that he was first able to play, he would ride a cane for a horse, and, clad in one of his father’s vests, which reached nearly to his heels, he would stuff his pockets with bottles and powders, and pretend to visit his patients. 

Diving<====>8402<====>Diving   Diving is the sport of jumping or falling into water from a platform or springboard, usually while performing acrobatics.  Diving is an internationally recognized sport that is part of the Olympic Games.   In addition, unstructured and non-competitive diving is a recreational pastime. Diving is one of the most popular Olympic sports with spectators.   Competitors possess many of the same characteristics as gymnasts and dancers, including strength, flexibility, kinaesthetic judgment and air awareness.  Some professional divers were originally gymnasts or dancers as both the sports have similar characteristics to diving.  Dmitri Sautin holds the record for most Olympic diving medals won, by winning eight medals in total between 1992 and 2008. 

Dative case<====>8406<====>Dative caseThe dative case (abbreviated  , or sometimes   when it is a core argument) is a grammatical case used in some languages to indicate, among other uses, the noun to which something is given, as in "Maria  Jacobo  potum dedit", Latin for "Maria gave  Jacob  a drink".  In these examples, the dative marks what would be considered the indirect object of a verb in English. Sometimes the dative has functions unrelated to giving.  In Scottish Gaelic and Irish, the term dative case is used in traditional grammars to refer to the prepositional case-marking of nouns following simple prepositions and the definite article.

Situated on the Timor Sea, Darwin is the largest city in the sparsely populated Northern Territory, with a  population of 145,916.    Estimated resident population, 30 June 2016.   It is the smallest and most northerly of the Australian capital cities, and acts as the Top End's regional centre. Darwin's proximity to South East Asia makes it a link between Australia and countries such as Indonesia and East Timor.  The Stuart Highway begins in Darwin, ending at Port Augusta in South Australia. 

Dictator<====>8409<====>Dictator  A dictator is a political leader who possesses absolute power and wields it in an oppressive or abusive manner.  A state of which is ruled by a dictator is called a dictatorship.  The word originated as the title of a magistrate in the Roman Republic appointed by the Senate to rule the republic in times of emergency (see Roman dictator and justitium).  Like the term "tyrant" (which was originally a respectable Ancient Greek title), and to a lesser degree "autocrat", "dictator" came to be used almost exclusively as a non-titular term for oppressive, even abusive rule, yet it had rare modern titular use.

Darwinism<====>8411<====>Darwinism  Darwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by the English naturalist Charles Darwin (1809–1882) and others, stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce.  Also called Darwinian theory, it originally included the broad concepts of transmutation of species or of evolution which gained general scientific acceptance after Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859, including concepts which predated Darwin's theories.  It subsequently referred to the specific concepts of natural selection, the Weismann barrier, or the central dogma of molecular biology.

Dartmoor Preservation Association<====>8414<====>Dartmoor Preservation Association   Dartmoor Preservation Association (DPA) is one of the oldest environmental or amenity bodies in the UK.  It was founded in 1883.  Kelly, M.  "Quartz and Feldspar.  Dartmoor: A British Landscape in Modern Times", Jonathan Cape, London, 2015,It concerns itself with Dartmoor, a National Park in Devon, south-west England.  It began with two main areas of concern.  Firstly, commoners’ rights were being eroded through army use, including the firing of live artillery shells, and piecemeal enclosure of land around the margins.  Moore, Stuart A. 

Dartmouth College<====>8418<====>Dartmouth College   Dartmouth College (   ) is a private Ivy League research university in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States.  Established in 1769 by Eleazar Wheelock, it is the ninth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.   Although founded as a school to educate Native Americans in Christian theology and the English way of life, Dartmouth primarily trained Congregationalist ministers throughout its early history before it gradually secularized, emerging at the turn of the 20th century from relative obscurity into national prominence. 

Dartmouth, Devon<====>8419<====>Dartmouth, Devon    Dartmouth is a town and civil parish in the English county of Devon.

Dodo<====>8420<====>Dodo    The dodo (Raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of Mauritius, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean.  The dodo's closest genetic relative was the also extinct Rodrigues solitaire, the two forming the subfamily Raphinae of the family of pigeons and doves.  The closest living relative of the dodo is the Nicobar pigeon.  A white dodo was once thought to have existed on the nearby island of Réunion, but this is now thought to have been confusion based on the Réunion ibis and paintings of white dodos. 

Sideroxylon grandiflorum<====>8421<====>Sideroxylon grandiflorum Sideroxylon grandiflorum, known as tambalacoque or dodo tree, is a long-lived tree in the family Sapotaceae, endemic to Mauritius.  It is valued for its timber. The Sideroxylon grandiflorum fruit is analogous to the peach.  They are both termed drupes because both have a hard endocarp, or pit, surrounding the seed, with the endocarp naturally splitting along a fracture line during germination. In 1973, it was thought that this species was dying out.  There were supposedly only 13 specimens left, all estimated to be about 300 years old.  The true age could not be determined because tambalacoque has no growth rings. 

Dwight Schultz<====>8425<====>Dwight Schultz  William Dwight Schultz (born November 24, 1947) is an American actor and voice artist.  He is known for his roles as Captain "Howling Mad" Murdock on the 1980s action series The A-Team, and as Reginald Barclay in Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Voyager and the film Star Trek: First Contact.    He is also well known in animation as the mad scientist Dr.  Animo in the Ben 10 series, Chef Mung Daal in the children's cartoon Chowder, and Eddie the Squirrel in CatDog.  Early lifeSchultz was born in Baltimore, Maryland, of German descent, and is a Roman Catholic. 

Density<====>8429<====>DensityThe density, or more precisely, the volumetric mass density, of a substance is its mass per unit volume.  The symbol most often used for density is ρ (the lower case Greek letter rho), although the Latin letter D can also be used.  Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume:   \rho = \frac{m}{V}, where ρ is the density, m is the mass, and V is the volume.  In some cases (for instance, in the United States oil and gas industry), density is loosely defined as its weight per unit volume,  although this is scientifically inaccurate – this quantity is more specifically called specific weight.

Diedrich Hermann Westermann<====>8437<====>Diedrich Hermann WestermannDiedrich Hermann Westermann (June 24, 1875–May 31, 1956) was a German missionary, Africanist, and linguist.  He substantially extended and revised the work of Carl Meinhof, his teacher, although he rejected some of Meinhof's theories only implicitly.  Westermann is seen as one of the founders of modern African linguistics.  He carried out extensive linguistic and anthropological research in the area ranging from Senegal eastwards to the Upper Nile.  His linguistic publications cover a wide range of African languages, including the Gbe languages, Nuer, Kpelle, Shilluk, Hausa, and Guang.  Westermann's comparative work, begun in 1911, initially brought together much of today's Niger–Congo and Nilo-Saharan language phyla under the name Sudanic languages. 

Diacritic<====>8439<====>Diacritic  A diacritic – also diacritical mark, diacritical point, or diacritical sign – is a glyph added to a letter, or basic glyph.  The term derives from the Ancient Greek   (diakritikós, "distinguishing"), from   (diakrī́nō, "to distinguish").  Diacritic is primarily an adjective, though sometimes used as a noun, whereas diacritical is only ever an adjective.  Some diacritical marks, such as the acute ( ´ ) and grave ( ` ), are often called accents.  Diacritical marks may appear above or below a letter, or in some other position such as within the letter or between two letters. 

Didgeridoo<====>8443<====>Didgeridoo    The didgeridoo ( ) (also known as a didjeridu) is a wind instrument developed by Indigenous Australians of northern Australia potentially within the last 1,500 years and still in widespread use today both in Australia and around the world.  It is sometimes described as a natural wooden trumpet or "drone pipe".  Musicologists classify it as a brass aerophone.  There are no reliable sources stating the didgeridoo's exact age.  Archaeological studies of rock art in Northern Australia suggest that the people of the Kakadu region of the Northern Territory have been using the didgeridoo for less than 1,000 years, based on the dating of paintings on cave walls and shelters from this period. 

Developmental biology<====>8449<====>Developmental biology Developmental biology is the study of the process by which animals and plants grow and develop.  Developmental biology also encompasses the biology of regeneration, asexual reproduction, metamorphosis, and the growth and differentiation of stem cells in the adult organism. In the late 20th century, the discipline has largely transformed into evolutionary developmental biology. PerspectivesThe main processes involved in the embryonic development of animals are: regional specification, morphogenesis, cell differentiation, growth, and the overall control of timing explored in evolutionary developmental biology.  Regional specification refers to the processes that create spatial pattern in a ball or sheet of initially similar cells.

Dartmoor wildlife<====>8453<====>Dartmoor wildlife Dartmoor and the fact that a great deal of it is undisturbed for much of the year is an encouragement to the wildlife. The more common mammals include:  Dartmoor ponies, rabbits, foxes, otters, badgers, grey squirrels, weasels, stoats, hares and deer.  Rumours abound of large wild cats such as cougars roaming wild on the moor, but little evidence has been forthcoming and until anything more substantial is available these reports should be filed under the general heading of cryptozoology. Herds of cattle and domestic sheep can be seen apparently roaming free on the moor.  All are owned by farmers and let out to graze. 

Double planet<====>8454<====>Double planet In astronomy, a double planet (also binary planet) is a binary system where both objects are of planetary mass.  The term is not recognized by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) and is therefore not an official classification.   At its 2006 General Assembly, the International Astronomical Union considered a proposal that Pluto and Charon be reclassified as a double planet,    but the proposal was abandoned in favor of the current definition of planet.  In promotional materials advertising the SMART-1 mission and pre-dating the IAU planet definition, the European Space Agency once referred to the Earth–Moon system as a double planet. 

Denaturation (biochemistry)<====>8456<====>Denaturation (biochemistry) Denaturation is a process in which proteins or nucleic acids lose the quaternary structure, tertiary structure and secondary structure which is present in their native state, by application of some external stress or compound such as a strong acid or base, a concentrated inorganic salt, an organic solvent (e. g. , alcohol or chloroform), radiation or heat.   If proteins in a living cell are denatured, this results in disruption of cell activity and possibly cell death.  Protein denaturation is also a consequence of cell death.    Denatured proteins can exhibit a wide range of characteristics, from conformational change and loss of solubility to aggregation due to the exposure of hydrophobic groups. 

Dwight L. Moody<====>8459<====>Dwight L.  Moody   Dwight Lyman Moody (February 5, 1837 – December 22, 1899), also known as D.  L.  Moody, was an American evangelist and publisher connected with the Holiness Movement, who founded the Moody Church, Northfield School and Mount Hermon School in Massachusetts (now Northfield Mount Hermon School), Moody Bible Institute and Moody Publishers. Early lifeDwight Moody was born in Northfield, Massachusetts, to a large family.  His father, Edwin J.  Moody (1800–1841), a small farmer and stonemason, died at the age of 41, when Dwight was only four years old;  his mother was Betsey Moody (née Holton; 1805–1896). 

Dieting<====>8460<====>Dieting Dieting is the practice of eating food in a regulated and supervised fashion to decrease, maintain, or increase body weight.  In other words, it is conscious control or restriction of the diet.  A restricted diet is often used by those who are overweight or obese, sometimes in combination with physical exercise, to reduce body weight.  Some people follow a diet to gain weight (usually in the form of muscle).  Diets can also be used to maintain a stable body weight and improve health.  In particular, diets can be designed to prevent or treat diabetes. 

Dubnium<====>8463<====>Dubnium  Dubnium is a synthetic chemical element with symbol Db and atomic number 105.  Dubnium is highly radioactive: the most stable known isotope, dubnium-268, has a half-life of just over a day.  This greatly limits the extent of research on dubnium. Dubnium does not occur naturally on Earth and is produced artificially.  The first discovery of the element was claimed by the Soviet Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in 1968, followed in 1970 by the American University of California.  Both teams proposed their names for the new element and used them without formal approval. 

Disaccharide<====>8464<====>DisaccharideA disaccharide (also called a double sugar or biose ) is the sugar formed when two monosaccharides (simple sugars) are joined by glycosidic linkage.  Like monosaccharides, disaccharides are soluble in water.  Three common examples are sucrose, lactose,  and maltose. Disaccharides are one of the four chemical groupings of carbohydrates  (monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides).  The most common types of disaccharides—sucrose, lactose, and maltose—have twelve carbon atoms, with the general formula C 12 H 22 O 11 .  The differences in these disaccharides are due to atomic arrangements within the molecule.  The joining of simple sugars into a double sugar happens by a condensation reaction, which involves the elimination of a water molecule from the functional groups only. 

Dactylic hexameter<====>8465<====>Dactylic hexameter Dactylic hexameters are the meter of Greek and Latin epic, didactic and pastoral poetry, and of Latin satire.  Outstanding writers of poetry in dactylic hexameters include Homer, Hesiod, Empedocles, Theocritus, Lucretius, Virgil, Horace, Ovid and Juvenal, among many others.  Dactylic hexameters also form part of elegiac poetry in both languages, alternating with dactylic pentameters. StructureA dactylic hexameter has six (in Greek ἕξ, hex) feet.  In strict dactylic hexameter, each foot would be a dactyl (a long and two short syllables), but classical meter allows for the substitution of a spondee (two long syllables) in place of a dactyl in most positions. 

Dorado<====>8466<====>Dorado  Dorado (English pronunciation:  ) is a constellation in the southern sky.  It was named in the late 16th century and is now one of the 88 modern constellations.  Its name refers to the dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus), which is known as dorado in Portuguese, although it has also been depicted as a swordfish.  Dorado contains most of the Large Magellanic Cloud, the remainder being in the constellation Mensa.  The South Ecliptic pole also lies within this constellation. Even though the name Dorado is not Latin but Portuguese, astronomers give it the Latin genitive form Doradus when naming its stars; it is treated (like the adjacent asterism Argo Navis) as a feminine proper name of Greek origin ending in -ō (like Io or Callisto or Argo), which have a genitive ending -ūs. 

Draco (lawgiver)<====>8467<====>Draco (lawgiver)  Draco ( ;  , Drakōn; fl.  c.  7th century BC) was the first recorded legislator of Athens in Ancient Greece.  He replaced the prevailing system of oral law and blood feud by a written code to be enforced only by a court.  Draco was the first democratic legislator, inasmuch as he was requested by the Athenian citizens to be a lawgiver for the city-state, but the citizens were fully unaware that Draco would establish harsh laws.   Draco's written law was characterized by its harshness.  To this day, the adjective draconian refers to similarly unforgiving rules or laws, in English For a look at the use of the term "draconian" in English today, see: and other western languages. 

Determinant<====>8468<====>Determinant In linear algebra, the determinant is a useful value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix.   The determinant of a matrix   is denoted  ,  , or  .  It can be viewed as the scaling factor of the transformation described by the matrix. In the case of a   matrix the specific formula for the determinant is: \begin{align}|A| = \begin{vmatrix} a & b\\c & d \end{vmatrix}=ad - bc . \end{align} Similarly, suppose we have a 3 × 3 matrix A, and we want the specific formula for its determinant  : \begin{align}|A| = \begin{vmatrix} a & b & c\\d & e & f\\g & h & i \end{vmatrix} &= a\,\begin{vmatrix} e & f\\h & i \end{vmatrix} - b\,\begin{vmatrix} d & f\\g & i \end{vmatrix} + c\,\begin{vmatrix} d & e\\g & h \end{vmatrix}\\ &= aei+bfg+cdh-ceg-bdi-afh. 

David Ricardo<====>8470<====>David Ricardo   David Ricardo (18 April 1772 – 11 September 1823) was a British political economist, one of the most influential of the classical economists along with Thomas Malthus, Adam Smith and James Mill.   Personal life Born in London, England, Ricardo was the third of 17 children of a Sephardic Jewish family of Portuguese origin who had recently relocated from the Dutch Republic.His father, Abraham Ricardo, was a successful stockbroker.    He began working with his father at the age of 14.   At age 21, Ricardo eloped with a Quaker, Priscilla Anne Wilkinson, and, against his father's wishes, converted to the Unitarian faith. 

Delphinus<====>8471<====>Delphinus  Delphinus   is a constellation in the northern sky, close to the celestial equator.  Its name is Latin for dolphin.  Delphinus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains among the 88 modern constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union.  It is one of the smaller constellations, ranked 69th in size. Delphinus' brightest stars form a distinctive asterism that can easily be recognized.  It is bordered (clockwise from north) by Vulpecula the fox, Sagitta the arrow, Aquila the eagle, Aquarius the water-carrier, Equuleus the foal and Pegasus the flying horse. 

Disk storage<====>8472<====>Disk storage Disk storage (also sometimes called the drive storage) is a general category of storage mechanisms where data is recorded by various electronic, magnetic, optical, or mechanical changes to a surface layer of one or more rotating disks.  A disk drive is a device implementing such a storage mechanism.  Notable types are the hard disk drive (HDD) containing a non-removable disk, the floppy disk drive (FDD) and its removable floppy disk, and various optical disc drives (ODD) and associated optical disc media. (The spelling disk and disc are used interchangeably except where trademarks preclude one usage, e. 

Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington<====>8474<====>Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington    Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington,   (1 May 1769 – 14 September 1852) was an Anglo-Irish soldier and statesman who was one of the leading military and political figures of 19th-century Britain.  His defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 puts him in the first rank of Britain's military heroes. Wellesley was born in Dublin, into the Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland.  He was commissioned as an ensign in the British Army in 1787, serving in Ireland as aide-de-camp to two successive Lords Lieutenant of Ireland. 

Disk operating system<====>8476<====>Disk operating system  A disk operating system (abbreviated DOS) is a computer operating system that can use a disk storage device, such as a floppy disk, hard disk drive, or optical disc.  A disk operating system must provide a file system for organizing, reading, and writing files on the storage disk.  Strictly speaking, this definition does not apply to current generations of operating systems, such as versions of Microsoft Windows in use, and is more appropriately used only for older generations of operating systems. Disk operating systems were available for mainframes, microprocessors and home computers and were usually loaded from the disks themselves as part of the boot process. 

Doublespeak<====>8478<====>Doublespeak  Doublespeak is a language that deliberately obscures, disguises, distorts, or reverses the meaning of words.  Doublespeak may take the form of euphemisms (e. g. , "downsizing" for layoffs, "servicing the target" for bombing   ), in which case it is primarily meant to make the truth sound more palatable.  It may also refer to intentional ambiguity in language or to actual inversions of meaning.  In such cases, doublespeak disguises the nature of the truth.   Doublespeak is most closely associated with political language.Origins and conceptsThe term "doublespeak" originates in George Orwell's book Nineteen Eighty-Four. 

Dressed to Kill (1980 film)<====>8481<====>Dressed to Kill (1980 film)  Dressed to Kill is a 1980 American erotic thriller film written and directed by Brian De Palma and starring Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen, and Keith Gordon.  It centers on the murder of a housewife and an investigation involving a young prostitute who witnessed the murder, the victim’s teenaged son, and her psychiatrist.  The original music score is composed by Pino Donaggio. PlotKate Miller is a sexually frustrated housewife who is in therapy with New York City psychiatrist Dr.  Robert Elliott.  During an appointment, Kate attempts to seduce him, but Elliott rejects her advances. 

Diesel cycle<====>8483<====>Diesel cycle    The Diesel cycle is a combustion process of a reciprocating internal combustion engine.  In it, fuel is ignited by heat generated during the compression of air in the combustion chamber, into which fuel is then injected.  This is in contrast to igniting the fuel-air mixture with a spark plug as in the Otto cycle (four-stroke/petrol) engine.  Diesel engines are used in aircraft, automobiles, power generation, diesel-electric locomotives, and both surface ships and submarines.   The Diesel cycle is assumed to have constant pressure during the initial part of the combustion phase ( V_2  to  V_3  in the diagram, below). 

Deus Ex (video game)<====>8484<====>Deus Ex (video game)  Deus Ex ( ) is a 2000 action role-playing video game developed by Ion Storm and published by Eidos Interactive.  Set in a cyberpunk-themed dystopian world in the year 2052, the story follows JC Denton, an   agent given superhuman abilities by nanotechnology, as he sets out to combat hostile forces in a world ravaged by inequality and a deadly plague.  His missions entangle him in a conspiracy that brings him into conflict with the Triad, Majestic 12, and the Illuminati. Deus Ex s gameplay combines elements of the first-person shooter with stealth elements, adventure, and role-playing genres, allowing for its tasks and missions to be completed in a variety of ways, that in turn lead to differing outcomes. 

Diego Maradona<====>8485<====>Diego MaradonaDiego Armando Maradona Franco ( , born 30 October 1960) is an Argentine retired professional footballer.  He has served as a manager and coach at other clubs as well as the national team of Argentina.  Many in the sport, including football writers, players, and fans, regard Maradona as the greatest football player of all time.  He was joint FIFA Player of the 20th Century with Pelé.   "Maradona or Pele?".  CNN Sports Illustrated, 10 December 2000.  Retrieved 13 March 2013 An advanced playmaker who operated in the classic number 10 position, Maradona is the first player in football history to set the world record transfer fee twice, first when he transferred to Barcelona for a then world record £5 million, and second, when he transferred to Napoli for another record fee £6. 

David Brewster<====>8487<====>David Brewster    Sir David Brewster  KH PRSE FRS FSA(Scot) FSSA MICE  (11 December 1781 10 February 1868) was a British physicist, mathematician, astronomer, inventor, writer, historian of science and university principal. Most noted for his contributions to the field of optics, he studied the double refraction by compression and discovered the photoelastic effect,  which gave birth to the field of optical mineralogy.  A.  D.  Morrison-Low (2004) "Brewster, Sir David (1781–1868)" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography    For his work, William Whewell dubbed him the "Father of modern experimental optics" and "the Johannes Kepler of Optics. 

Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling<====>8488<====>Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling   Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) is an in-band telecommunication signaling system using the voice-frequency band over telephone lines between telephone equipment and other communications devices and switching centers.  DTMF was first developed in the Bell System in the United States, and became known under the trademark Touch-Tone for use in push-button telephones supplied to telephone customers, starting in 1963.    DTMF is standardized as ITU-T Recommendation Q. 23.   It is also known in the UK as MF4. The Touch-Tone system using a telephone keypad gradually replaced the use of rotary dial and has become the industry standard for  landline and mobile service. 

Deuterocanonical books<====>8489<====>Deuterocanonical books The deuterocanonical books (from the Greek meaning "belonging to the second canon") are the books and passages of the Christian Old Testament that are not part of the Hebrew Bible.  The term, used since the 16th century by the Catholic Church and sometimes by Orthodox Christianity,  distinguishes these texts from the protocanonical books, which are the books contained in the Hebrew canon.  The distinction arose as a result of the debate in the early Church as to which texts should be classified as canonical.  The term is used as a matter of convenience by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and other Churches to refer to books of their Old Testament which are not part of the Masoretic Text. 

Discus throw<====>8490<====>Discus throw   The discus throw ( ) is a track and field event in which an athlete throws a heavy frisbee—called a discus—in an attempt to mark a farther distance than their competitors.  It is an ancient sport, as demonstrated by the fifth-century-BC Myron statue, Discobolus.  Although not part of the modern pentathlon, it was one of the events of the ancient Greek pentathlon, which can be dated back to at least to 708 BC.  HistoryDiscus is a routine part of most modern track-and-field meets at all levels and is a sport which is particularly iconic of the Olympic Games. 

Discrete mathematics<====>8492<====>Discrete mathematics  Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than  .  In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying "smoothly", the objects studied in discrete mathematics – such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic  – do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values.   Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as calculus and analysis.  Discrete objects can often be enumerated by integers.  More formally, discrete mathematics has been characterized as the branch of mathematics dealing with countable sets  (sets that have the same cardinality as subsets of the natural numbers, including rational numbers but not real numbers). 

Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane<====>8494<====>Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane   Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, commonly known as DDT, is a colorless, tasteless, and almost odorless crystalline chemical compound, an organochlorine, originally developed as an insecticide, and ultimately becoming infamous for its environmental impacts.  First synthesized in 1874, DDT's insecticidal action was discovered by the Swiss chemist Paul Hermann Müller in 1939.  DDT was used in the second half of World War II to control malaria and typhus among civilians and troops.  Müller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for his discovery of the high efficiency of DDT as a contact poison against several arthropods" in 1948. 

Data set<====>8495<====>Data set A data set (or dataset) is a collection of data.  Most commonly a data set  corresponds to the contents of a single database table, or a single statistical data matrix, where every column of the table represents a particular variable, and each row corresponds to a given member of the data set in question.  The data set lists values for each of the variables, such as height and weight of an object, for each member of the data set.   Each value is known as a datum.  The data set may comprise data for one or more members, corresponding to the number of rows. 

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders<====>8498<====>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental DisordersThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and offers a common language and standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders.  It is used, or relied upon, by clinicians, researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, the legal system, and policy makers together with alternatives such as the ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders, produced by the WHO.  The DSM is now in its fifth edition, the DSM-5, published on May 18, 2013.  The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, and from a United States Army manual. 

Dar es Salaam<====>8500<====>Dar es Salaam  Dar es Salaam (from    , "the house of peace"; formerly Mzizima) is the former capital and largest city in Tanzania.  It is the largest city in East Africa by population, as well as a regionally important economic centre.Located on the Swahili coast, the city is one of the fastest growing cities in the world.    Until 1974, Dar es Salaam served as Tanzania’s capital city, at which point the capital city commenced transferring to Dodoma, which was officially completed in 1996.  However, as of 2017, it continues to remain a focus of central government bureaucracy, although this is in the process of fully moving to Dodoma. 

Distributed computing<====>8501<====>Distributed computing  Distributed computing  is  a field of computer science that studies distributed systems.  A distributed system is a model in which components located on networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages.The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal.  Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, lack of a global clock, and independent failure of components.   Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications. A computer program that runs in a distributed system is called a distributed program, and distributed programming is the process of writing such programs. 

Dublin<====>8504<====>Dublin Dublin ( ,) is the capital of and largest city in Ireland.    Dublin is in the province of Leinster on the east coast of Ireland, at the mouth of the River Liffey and bordered on the South by the Wicklow Mountains.  The city has an urban area population of 1,173,179.   The population of the Dublin Region,  , was 1,347,359 people.  There is archaeological debate regarding precisely where Dublin was established by Celtic-speaking people in the 7th century.Later expanded as a Viking settlement, the Kingdom of Dublin became Ireland's principal city following the Norman invasion. 

DirectX<====>8506<====>DirectX  Microsoft DirectX is a collection of application programming interfaces (APIs) for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming and video, on Microsoft platforms.  Originally, the names of these APIs all began with Direct, such as Direct3D, DirectDraw, DirectMusic, DirectPlay, DirectSound, and so forth.  The name DirectX was coined as a shorthand term for all of these APIs (the X standing in for the particular API names) and soon became the name of the collection.  When Microsoft later set out to develop a gaming console, the X was used as the basis of the name Xbox to indicate that the console was based on DirectX technology. 

Slalom skiing<====>8508<====>Slalom skiingSlalom is an alpine skiing and alpine snowboarding discipline, involving skiing between poles or gates.  These are spaced more closely than those in giant slalom, super giant slalom and downhill, necessitating quicker and shorter turns.   Internationally, the sport is contested at the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships, and at the Olympic Winter Games. The term may also refer to waterskiing on one ski. History The word "slalom" is from the Morgedal/Seljord dialect of Norwegian slalåm: "sla," meaning slightly inclining hillside, and "låm," meaning track after skis.    The inventors of modern skiing classified their trails according to their difficulty. 

Dachshund<====>8518<====>Dachshund   The dachshund (  oror   ) is a short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed. The standard size dachshund was developed to scent, chase, and flush out badgers and other burrow-dwelling animals, while the miniature dachshund was bred to hunt smaller prey such as rabbits.  In the United States, they have also been used to track wounded deer and hunt prairie dogs. Dachshunds also participate in conformation shows, field trials and many other events organized through pure-bred dog organizations such as the American Kennel Club (AKC).  According to the AKC, the dachshund is ranked in 13th place in popularity amongst dog breeds in the United States. 

Data structure<====>8519<====>Data structure   In computer science, a data  structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.  UsageData structures can implement one or more particular abstract data types (ADT), which specify the operations that can be performed on a data structure and the computational complexity of those operations.  In comparison, a data structure is a concrete implementation of the space  provided by an ADT. 

Dmitri Shostakovich<====>8520<====>Dmitri Shostakovich   Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich ( ,  ;   9 August 1975) was a Russian composer and pianist.  He is regarded as one of the major composers of the 20th century.Shostakovich achieved fame in the Soviet Union under the patronage of Soviet chief of staff Mikhail Tukhachevsky, but later had a complex and difficult relationship with the government.  Nevertheless, he received accolades and state awards and served in the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR (1947–1962)  and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (from 1962 until his death). 

Doom (1993 video game)<====>8521<====>Doom (1993 video game) Doom (typeset as DOOM in official documents)  is a 1993 science fiction horror-themed first-person shooter (FPS) video game by id Software.  It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in video game history, for having helped to pioneer the now-ubiquitous first-person shooter.  The original game was divided into three nine-level episodes and was distributed via shareware and mail order.  The Ultimate Doom, an updated release of the original game featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail. In Doom, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine, who became popularly known as "Doomguy"    , fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from Hell. 

Denver<====>8522<====>Denver    Denver ( ), officially the City and County of Denver, is the capital and most populous municipality of the U. S.  state of Colorado.  Denver is in the South Platte River Valley on the western edge of the High Plains just east of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.  The Denver downtown district is immediately east of the confluence of Cherry Creek with the South Platte River, approximately   east of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.  Denver is nicknamed the Mile High City because its official elevation is exactly one mile ( ) above sea level, making it the highest major city in the United States. 

Deuterium<====>8524<====>Deuterium   Deuterium (or hydrogen-2, symbol   or  , also known as heavy hydrogen) is one of two stable isotopes of hydrogen (the other being protium, or hydrogen-1).  The nucleus of deuterium, called a deuteron, contains one proton and one neutron, whereas the far more common protium has no neutron in the nucleus.  Deuterium has a natural abundance in Earth's oceans of about one atom in   of hydrogen.  Thus deuterium accounts for approximately 0. 0156% (or, on a mass basis, 0. 0312%) of all the naturally occurring hydrogen in the oceans, while protium accounts for more than 99. 

Digital signal processing<====>8525<====>Digital signal processing  Digital signal processing (DSP) is the use of digital processing, such as by computers, to perform a wide variety of signal processing operations.   The signals processed in this manner are a sequence of numbers that represent samples of a continuous variable in a domain such as time, space, or frequency. Digital signal processing and analog signal processing are subfields of signal processing.  DSP applications include audio and speech processing, sonar, radar and other sensor array processing, spectral density estimation, statistical signal processing, digital image processing, signal processing for telecommunications, control systems, biomedical engineering, seismology, among others. 

Discordianism<====>8527<====>Discordianism Discordianism is a paradigm based upon the book Principia Discordia,  written by Greg Hill with Kerry Wendell Thornley in 1963, the two working under the pseudonyms Malaclypse the Younger and Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst.  According to its primary historian (Adam Gorightly) Discordianism was founded as a parody religion.  Many outside observers still regard Discordianism as a parody religion although some of its adherents may utilize it as a legitimate religion, or a metaphor for a governing philosophy.  The Principia Discordia, if read literally, encourages the worship of Eris, a. k. a.  Discordia, the goddess of chaos, or archetypes and or ideals associated with her. 

Disjunction introduction<====>8528<====>Disjunction introduction Disjunction introduction or addition (also called or introduction)    is a rule of inference of propositional logic and almost every other deduction system.  The rule makes it possible to introduce disjunctions to logical proofs.  It is the inference that if P is true, then P or Q must be true. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is a man or pigs are flying in formation over the English Channel. The rule can be expressed as: \frac{P}{\therefore P \or Q} where the rule is that whenever instances of " P " appear on lines of a proof, " P \or Q " can be placed on a subsequent line. 

Disjunction elimination<====>8529<====>Disjunction elimination In propositional logic, disjunction elimination   (sometimes named proof by cases, case analysis, or or elimination), is the valid argument form and rule of inference that allows one to eliminate a disjunctive statement from a logical proof.  It is the inference that  if a statement  P  implies a statement  Q  and a statement  R  also implies  Q , then if either  P  or  R  is true, then  Q  has to be true.  The reasoning is simple: since at least one of the statements P and R is true, and since either of them would be sufficient to entail Q, Q is certainly true. 

Dead Sea<====>8530<====>Dead Sea   The Dead Sea (    lit.  Sea of Salt;The first article al- is unnecessary and usually not used.  ) is a salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east and Israel and Palestine to the west.  Its surface and shores are   below sea level,Earth's lowest elevation on land.  The Dead Sea is   deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world.  With a salinity of 342 g/kg, or 34. 2%, (in 2011), it is 9. 6 times as salty as the ocean and one of the world's saltiest bodies of water. 

Dragon<====>8531<====>DragonA dragon is a legendary creature, typically scaled or fire-spewing and with serpentine, reptilian or avian traits, that features in the myths of many cultures around world.  The two most well-known cultural traditions of dragon are:The European dragon, derived from  European folk traditions and ultimately related to Balkans and Western Asian mythologies.  Most are depicted as reptilian creatures with animal-level intelligence, and are uniquely six-limbed (four legs and a separate set of wings). The Chinese dragon, with counterparts in Japan (namely the Japanese dragon), Korea and other East Asian and South Asian countries. 

Depeche Mode<====>8533<====>Depeche Mode   Depeche Mode   are an English electronic band that formed in Basildon, Essex in 1980.  The group consists of founders Dave Gahan (lead vocals), Martin Gore (guitar, keyboards, vocals), and Andy Fletcher (keyboards, bass).  Depeche Mode released their debut album Speak & Spell in 1981, bringing the band onto the British new wave scene.  Original band member Vince Clarke (keyboards, guitar), left the band after the release of the album, leaving the band as a trio to record A Broken Frame, released the following year.  Gore took over the lead songwriting duties and, later in 1982, Alan Wilder (drums, percussion, keyboards) officially joined the band to fill Clarke's spot, establishing a line up that would continue for the next 13 years. 

Differential cryptanalysis<====>8536<====>Differential cryptanalysisDifferential cryptanalysis is a general form of cryptanalysis applicable primarily to block ciphers, but also to stream ciphers and cryptographic hash functions.  In the broadest sense, it is the study of how differences in information input can affect the resultant difference at the output.  In the case of a block cipher, it refers to a set of techniques for tracing differences through the network of transformation, discovering where the cipher exhibits non-random behavior, and exploiting such properties to recover the secret key (cryptography key). HistoryThe discovery of differential cryptanalysis is generally attributed to Eli Biham and Adi Shamir in the late 1980s, who published a number of attacks against various block ciphers and hash functions, including a theoretical weakness in the Data Encryption Standard (DES). 

Document type definition<====>8537<====>Document type definitionA document type definition (DTD) is a set of markup declarations that define a document type for an SGML-family markup language (SGML, XML, HTML). A Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal building blocks of an XML document.  It defines the document structure with a list of legal elements and attributes.  A DTD can be declared inline inside an XML document, or as an external reference.  XML uses a subset of SGML DTD.  , newer XML namespace-aware schema languages (such as W3C XML Schema and ISO RELAX NG) have largely superseded DTDs.  A namespace-aware version of DTDs is being developed as Part 9 of ISO DSDL. 

Devil<====>8539<====>Devil   The Devil (from Greek:   diábolos "slanderer, accuser")  designate the personification of evil in various cultures.   In Abrahamic religions he is often identified with Satan.  In Christianity he is the primary opponent of God.    Christianity identifies the Devil ("Satan") with the serpent who tempted Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, and describes him as a "fallen angel" who terrorizes the world through evil,  is the antithesis of Truth,  and shall be condemned, together with the fallen angels who follow him, to eternal fire at the Last Judgement. 

Diesel engine<====>8540<====>Diesel engine   The diesel engine (also known as a compression-ignition or CI engine), named after Rudolf Diesel, is an internal combustion engine in which ignition of the fuel which is injected into the combustion chamber is caused by the elevated temperature of the air in the cylinder due to mechanical compression (adiabatic compression).  Diesel engines work by compressing only the air.  This increases the air temperature inside the cylinder to such a high degree that atomised diesel fuel that is injected into the  combustion chamber ignites spontaneously.  This contrasts with spark-ignition engines such as a petrol engine (gasoline engine) or gas engine (using a gaseous fuel as opposed to petrol), which use a spark plug to ignite an air-fuel mixture. 

Drawing<====>8544<====>Drawing Drawing is a form of visual art in which a person uses various drawing instruments to mark paper or another two-dimensional medium.  Instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, inked brushes, wax colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, various kinds of erasers, markers, styluses, various metals (such as silverpoint) and electronic drawing. A drawing instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark.  The most common support for drawing is paper, although other materials, such as cardboard, plastic, leather, canvas, and board, may be used.  Temporary drawings may be made on a blackboard or whiteboard or indeed almost anything. 

Dedham, Massachusetts<====>8545<====>Dedham, Massachusetts   Dedham   is a town in and the county seat of Norfolk County, Massachusetts, United States.   The population was 24,729 at the 2010 census.   It is located on Boston's southwest border.  On the northwest it is bordered by Needham, on the southwest by Westwood and on the southeast by Canton.  The town was first settled in 1635. History Settled in 1635 by people from Roxbury and Watertown, Dedham was incorporated in 1636.  It became the county seat of Norfolk County when the county was formed from parts of Suffolk County on March 26, 1793. 

Book of Deuteronomy<====>8547<====>Book of Deuteronomy  The Book of Deuteronomy (from  , Deuteronómion, "second law";  , Devārīm, "[spoken] words") is the fifth book of the Torah (a section of the Hebrew Bible) and the Christian Old Testament.  The Hebrew title is taken from the opening phrase Eleh ha-devarim, "These are the words. . . ".  The English title "Deuteronomy" comes from the Greek deuteronomion, meaning "second law", taken from the Septuagint's (Greek) phrase to deuteronomion touto, "this second law", in  .  This Greek phrase is itself a mistranslation of the Hebrew mishneh haTorah hazoth, "a copy of this law". 

David<====>8551<====>David David  is described in the Hebrew Bible as the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah. In the biblical narrative, David is a young shepherd who first gains fame as a musician and later by killing Goliath.  He becomes a favorite of King Saul and a close friend of Saul's son Jonathan.  Worried that David is trying to take his throne, Saul turns on David.  After Saul and Jonathan are killed in battle, David is anointed as King.  David conquers Jerusalem, taking the Ark of the Covenant into the city, and establishing the kingdom founded by Saul.

The producers were Matthew Householder and Bill Roper. Building on the success of its predecessor Diablo (1996), Diablo II was one of the most popular games of 2000.  Madigan, Jamie.  "GameSpy. 

Design<====>8560<====>Design  Design is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object, system or measurable human interaction (as in architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams, and sewing patterns).    Design has different connotations in different fields (see design disciplines below).  In some cases, the direct construction of an object (as in pottery, engineering, management, coding, and graphic design) is also considered to use design thinking. Designing often necessitates considering the aesthetic, functional, economic, and sociopolitical dimensions of both the design object and design process.  It may involve considerable research, thought, modeling, interactive adjustment, and re-design. 

Denormalization<====>8561<====>Denormalization Denormalization is a strategy used on a previously-normalized database to increase performance .  In computing, denormalization is the process of trying to improve the read performance of a database, at the expense of losing some write performance, by adding redundant copies of data or by grouping data.It is often motivated by performance or scalability in relational database software needing to carry out very large numbers of read operations.  Denormalization should not be confused with Unnormalized form.  Databases/tables must first be normalized to efficiently denormalize them. A normalized design will often "store" different but related pieces of information in separate logical tables (called relations). 

Differential topology<====>8562<====>Differential topology In mathematics, differential topology is the field dealing with differentiable functions on differentiable manifolds.  It is closely related to differential geometry and together they make up the geometric theory of differentiable manifolds. DescriptionDifferential topology considers the properties and structures that require only a smooth structure on a manifold to be defined.   Smooth manifolds are 'softer' than manifolds with extra geometric structures, which can act as obstructions to certain types of equivalences and deformations that exist in differential topology.  For instance, volume and Riemannian curvature are invariants that can distinguish different geometric structures on the same smooth manifold—that is, one can smoothly "flatten out" certain manifolds, but it might require distorting the space and affecting the curvature or volume. 

Diffeomorphism<====>8564<====>Diffeomorphism  In mathematics, a diffeomorphism is an isomorphism of smooth manifolds.  It is an invertible function that maps one differentiable manifold to another such that both the function and its inverse are smooth. DefinitionGiven two manifolds M and N, a differentiable map f : M → N is called a diffeomorphism if it is a bijection and its inverse f −1  : N → M is differentiable as well.  If these functions are r times continuously differentiable, f is called a C r -diffeomorphism. Two manifolds M and N are diffeomorphic (symbol usually being ≃) if there is a diffeomorphism f from M to N. 

Dune Messiah<====>8567<====>Dune Messiah Dune Messiah is a science fiction novel by Frank Herbert, the second in his Dune series of six novels.  It was originally serialized in Galaxy magazine in 1969.  The American and British editions have different prologues summarizing events in the previous novel.  Dune Messiah and its sequel Children of Dune were collectively adapted by the Sci-Fi Channel in 2003 into a miniseries entitled Frank Herbert's Children of Dune.  In 2002, the Science Fiction Book Club also published the two novels in one volume.  ==Plot summary== Twelve years after the events described in Dune (1965), Paul "Muad'Dib" Atreides rules as Emperor. 

Duke Nukem 3D<====>8569<====>Duke Nukem 3D   Duke Nukem 3D is a first-person shooter video game developed by 3D Realms and published by GT Interactive Software.  It is a sequel to the platform games Duke Nukem and Duke Nukem II, published by 3D Realms. Duke Nukem 3D features the adventures of the titular Duke Nukem, voiced by Jon St.  John, who fights against an alien invasion on Earth.  Along with Wolfenstein 3D and Doom, Duke Nukem 3D is considered to be responsible for popularizing first-person shooters, and was released to major acclaim.  Reviewers praised the interactivity of the environments, gameplay, level design, and unique risqué humor, a mix of pop-culture satire and lampooning of over-the-top Hollywood action heroes. 

Daoism–Taoism romanization issue<====>8573<====>Daoism–Taoism romanization issue  In English, the words Daoism and Taoism (  or  ) are the subject of an ongoing controversy over the preferred romanized spelling for the native Chinese philosophy/ religion of taoism.  The root Chinese word 道 "way, path" is romanized tao in the older Wade–Giles system and dào in the modern Pinyin system.  The sometimes heated arguments over Taoism vs.  Daoism involve sinology, phonemes, loanwords, and politics. Phonetic transcription (representing each distinct speech sound with a separate symbol) is shown with the   enclosed in square brackets [ ], and phonemic transcription (representing a small set of speech sounds that a particular language distinguishes) is enclosed within virgules or slashes / /. 

Tao Te Ching<====>8574<====>Tao Te ChingThe Tao Te Ching ( ),  .   also known by its pinyin romanizations Daodejing and Dao De Jing, is a Chinese classic text traditionally credited to the 6th-century BCE sage Laozi.  The text's authorship, date of composition and date of compilation are debated.   The oldest excavated portion dates back to the late 4th century BCE,  but modern scholarship dates other parts of the text as having been written—or at least compiled—later than the earliest portions of the Zhuangzi.  The Tao Te Ching, along with the Zhuangzi, is a fundamental text for both philosophical and religious Taoism. 

Detroit Lions<====>8577<====>Detroit Lions   The Detroit Lions are a professional American football team based in Detroit, Michigan.  The Lions compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) North division.  The team plays its home games at Ford Field in Downtown Detroit. Originally based in Portsmouth, Ohio and called the Portsmouth Spartans, the team formally joined the NFL on July 12, 1930 and began play in the 1930 season.   Despite success within the NFL, they could not survive in Portsmouth, then the NFL's smallest city.  The team was purchased and relocated to Detroit for the 1934 season. 

Dyne<====>8578<====>Dyne The dyne (symbol dyn, from Greek δύναμις, dynamis, meaning power, force) is a unit of force specified in the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS), a predecessor of the modern SI.  One dyne is equal to 10 micronewtons, 10 −5 N or to 10 nsn (nanosthenes) in the old metre–tonne–second system of units.  Equivalently, the dyne is defined as "the force required to accelerate a mass of one gram at a rate of one centimetre per second squared": 1 dyn = 1 g⋅cm/s 2  = 10 −5  kg⋅m/s 2  = 10 −5  N1 N = 1 kg⋅m/s 2  = 10 5  g⋅cm/s 2  = 10 5  dynThe dyne per centimetre is a unit traditionally used to measure surface tension. 

Detroit Tigers<====>8579<====>Detroit Tigers The Detroit Tigers are an American professional baseball team based in Detroit, Michigan.  The Tigers compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) Central division.  One of the AL's eight charter franchises, the club was founded in Detroit in  .

The Tigers have won four World Series championships ( ,  ,  , and  ), 11 AL pennants (1907, 1908, 1909, 1934, 1935, 1940, 1945, 1968, 1984, 2006, 2012), and four AL Central division championships (2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014). 

Diocletian<====>8580<====>Diocletian  Diocletian ( ;  ), born Diocles (244–312),was a Roman emperor from 284 to 305.  Born to a family of low status in Dalmatia, Diocletian rose through the ranks of the military to become Roman cavalry commander to the Emperor Carus.  After the deaths of Carus and his son Numerian on campaign in Persia, Diocletian was proclaimed emperor.  The title was also claimed by Carus' other surviving son, Carinus, but Diocletian defeated him in the Battle of the Margus.  Diocletian's reign stabilized the empire and marks the end of the Crisis of the Third Century. 

Deism<====>8582<====>Deism    Deism (  or    ; derived from Latin "deus" meaning "god") is a philosophical position that posits that God (or in some cases, gods) does not interfere directly with the world; conversely it can also be stated as a system of belief which posits God's existence as the cause of all things, and admits His perfection (and usually the existence of natural law and Providence) but rejects Divine revelation or direct intervention of God in the universe by miracles.   It also rejects revelation as a source of religious knowledge and asserts that reason and observation of the natural world are sufficient to determine the existence of a single creator or absolute principle of the universe. 

Dramaturge<====>8584<====>DramaturgeA dramaturge or dramaturg is a professional within a theatre or opera company who deals mainly with research and development of plays or operas.   Its modern-day function was originated by the innovations of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, an 18th-century German playwright, philosopher, and theorist about theatre.  ResponsibilitiesOne of the dramaturge's contributions is to categorize and discuss the various types of plays or operas, their interconnectedness and their styles.   The responsibilities of a dramaturge vary from one theatre or opera company to the next.   They might include the hiring of actors, the development of a season of plays or operas with a sense of coherence among them, assistance with and editing of new plays or operas by resident or guest playwrights or composers/librettists, the creation of programs or accompanying educational services, helping the director with rehearsals, and serving as elucidator of history or spokesperson for deceased or otherwise absent playwrights or composers. 

Dyson sphere<====>8586<====>Dyson sphereA Dyson sphere is a hypothetical megastructure that completely encompasses a star and captures most or all of its power output.  The first contemporary description of the structure was by Olaf Stapledon in his science fiction novel Star Maker (1937), in which he described "every solar system. . .  surrounded by a gauze of light traps, which focused the escaping solar energy for intelligent use. "  The concept was later popularized by Freeman Dyson in his 1960 paper "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation".Dyson speculated that such structures would be the logical consequence of the escalating energy needs of a technological civilization and would be a necessity for its long-term survival. 

Democide<====>8587<====>Democide Democide is a term revived and redefined by the political scientist R.  J.  Rummel as "the murder of any person or people by their government, including genocide, politicide and mass murder".  Government-sponsored large-scale killings for racial or political reasons would be considered democide under Rummel's definition.  Democide can also include deaths arising from "intentionally or knowingly reckless and depraved disregard for life"; this brings into account many deaths arising through various neglects and abuses, such as forced mass starvation.  Rummel explicitly excludes battle deaths in his definition.  Capital punishment, actions taken against armed civilians during mob action or riot, and the deaths of noncombatants killed during attacks on military targets so long as the primary target is military, are not considered democide.

He later establishes his political power with the co-operation of the Roman Senate. 536 – Gothic War: The Byzantine general Belisarius enters Rome unopposed; the Gothic garrison flee the capital. 730 – Battle of Marj Ardabil: The Khazars annihilate an Umayyad army and kill its commander, Al-Jarrah Ibn Abdallah Al-Hakami. 1425 – The Catholic University of Leuven is founded. 1531 – The Virgin of Guadalupe first appears to Juan Diego at Tepeyac, Mexico City. 1688 – Glorious Revolution: Williamite forces defeat Jacobites at Battle of Reading, forcing flight of James II from the country. 

Diaspora studies<====>8591<====>Diaspora studies Diaspora studies is an academic field established in the late 20th century to study dispersed ethnic populations, which are often termed diaspora peoples.  The usage of the term diaspora carries the connotation of forced resettlement, due to expulsion, coercion, slavery, racism, or war, especially nationalist conflicts.  Academic institutesThe International Institute for Diasporic and Transcultural Studies (IIDTS) — a transnational institute incorporating Jean Moulin University (Lyons, France), the University of Cyprus, Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China) and Liverpool Hope University (UK) — is a dedicated research network operating in a transdisciplinary logic and focused on cultural representation (and auto-representation) of diasporic communities throughout the world. 

Domitian<====>8592<====>Domitian  Domitian ( ;  ;  24 October 51 – 18 September 96) was Roman emperor from 81 to 96.  He was the younger brother of Titus and son of Vespasian, his two predecessors on the throne, and the last member of the Flavian dynasty.   During his reign, his authoritarian rule put him at sharp odds with the senate, whose powers he drastically curtailed. Domitian had a minor and largely ceremonial role during the reigns of his father and brother.  After the death of his brother, Domitian was declared emperor by the Praetorian Guard.   His 15-year reign was the longest since that of Tiberius. 

Damascus steel<====>8593<====>Damascus steel Damascus steel was a type of steel used for manufacturing sword blades in the Near East made with wootz steel.   These swords are characterized by distinctive patterns of banding and mottling reminiscent of flowing water.  Such blades were reputed to be tough, resistant to shattering, and capable of being honed to a sharp, resilient edge.    The steel is named after Damascus, the capital city of Syria.  It may either refer to swords made or sold in Damascus directly, or it may just refer to the aspect of the typical patterns, by comparison with  Damask fabrics (which are themselves named after Damascus). 

Stab-in-the-back myth<====>8594<====>Stab-in-the-back myth The stab-in-the-back myth ( ,  )  was the notion, widely believed and promulgated in right-wing circles in Germany after 1918, that the German Army did not lose World War I on the battlefield but was instead betrayed by the civilians on the home front, especially the republicans who overthrew the monarchy in the German Revolution of 1918–19.  Advocates denounced the German government leaders who signed the Armistice on November 11, 1918, as the "November Criminals" ( ). When the Nazis came to power in 1933, they made the legend an integral part of their official history of the 1920s, portraying the Weimar Republic as the work of the "November criminals" who used the stab in the back myth to seize power while betraying the nation. 

Davenport, Iowa<====>8599<====>Davenport, Iowa  Davenport is the county seat of Scott County in Iowa and is located along the Mississippi River on the eastern border of the state.  It is the largest of the Quad Cities, a metropolitan area with a population estimate of 382,630 and a CSA population of 474,226; it is the 90th largest CSA in the nation. Davenport was founded on May 14, 1836 by Antoine Le Claire and was named for his friend, George Davenport, a colonel who was stationed at nearby Fort Armstrong during the Black Hawk War.  According to the 2010 census, the city had a population of 99,685 (making it Iowa's third-largest city). 

Diffraction<====>8603<====>Diffraction Diffraction refers to various phenomena that occur when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit.  It is defined as the bending of light around the corners of an obstacle or aperture into the region of geometrical shadow of the obstacle.  In classical physics, the diffraction phenomenon is described as the interference of waves according to the Huygens–Fresnel principle.  These characteristic behaviors are exhibited when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit that is comparable in size to its wavelength.  Similar effects occur when a light wave travels through a medium with a varying refractive index, or when a sound wave travels through a medium with varying acoustic impedance. 

Stephen Donaldson (activist)<====>8605<====>Stephen Donaldson (activist) Stephen Donaldson (July 27, 1946 – July 18, 1996), born Robert Anthony Martin, Jr and also known by the pseudonym Donny the Punk, was an American bisexual political activist.  He is best known for his pioneering activism in LGBT rights and prison reform, and for his writing about punk rock and subculture. Childhood and adolescence (1946–1965)The son of a career naval officer, Donaldson spent his early childhood in different seaport cities in the eastern United States and in Germany.Donaldson later described his father Robert, the son of Italian and German immigrants, as a man who "frowned on display of emotion" and his mother Lois as "an English, Scottish Texan, artistic, free-spirited, emotional, impulsive. 

Dolmen<====>8608<====>Dolmen A dolmen ( ) is a type of single-chamber megalithic tomb, usually consisting of two or more vertical megaliths supporting a large flat horizontal capstone ("table"), although there are also more complex variants.  Most date from the early Neolithic (4000 3000 BC).  Dolmens were typically covered with earth or smaller stones to form a tumulus.  In many instances, that covering has weathered away, leaving only the stone "skeleton" of the burial mound intact. It remains unclear when, why, and by whom the earliest dolmens were made.  The oldest known dolmens are in Western Europe, where they were set in place around 7,000 years ago. 

Declination<====>8612<====>Declination In astronomy, declination (abbreviated dec; symbol δ) is one of the two angles that locate a point on the celestial sphere in the equatorial coordinate system, the other being hour angle.  Declination's angle is measured north or south of the celestial equator, along the hour circle passing through the point in question.    The root of the word declination (Latin, declinatio) means "a bending away" or "a bending down".  It comes from the same root as the words incline ("bend toward") and recline ("bend backward").    Explanation Declination in astronomy is comparable to geographic latitude, projected onto the celestial sphere, and hour angle is likewise comparable to longitude. 

Diaspora<====>8613<====>Diaspora  A diaspora (from Greek διασπορά, "scattering, dispersion")    is a scattered population whose origin lies within a smaller geographic locale.   Diaspora can also refer to the movement of the population from its original homeland. Diaspora has come to refer particularly to historical mass dispersions of an involuntary nature, such as the expulsion of Jews from Judea and the fleeing of Greeks after the fall of Constantinople.  Other examples are the African Trans-Atlantic slave trade, the southern Chinese or Indians during the coolie trade, the Irish during and after the Irish Famine, the Palestinian diaspora,   and the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries in the 20th century, the exile and deportation of Circassians, and the emigration of Anglo-Saxon warriors and their families after the Norman Conquest of England, many of whom found employment in Constantinople and bolstered the elite bodyguard of the emperor, the Varangian Guard. 

List of dog breeds<====>8615<====>List of dog breedsDogs have been selectively bred for thousands of years, sometimes by inbreeding dogs from the same ancestral lines, sometimes by mixing dogs from very different lines.   The process continues today, resulting in a widening in appearance without speciation, "from the Chihuahua to the Great Dane. " The following list uses a wide interpretation of "breed. " Breeds are usually categorized by the functional type from which the breed was developed.  The basic types are companion dogs, guard dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, and working dogs, although there are many other types and subtypes.  Breeds listed here may be traditional breeds with long histories as registered breeds, rare breeds with their own registries, or new breeds that may still be under development.

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol<====>8622<====>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol    The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on TCP/IP networks whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so they can communicate with other IP networks.  TechTarget Network: DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)  A DHCP server enables computers to request IP addresses and networking parameters automatically from the Internet service provider (ISP), reducing the need for a network administrator or a user to manually assign IP addresses to all network devices.   In the absence of a DHCP server, a computer or other device on the network needs to be manually assigned an IP address.

Differential geometry<====>8625<====>Differential geometry Differential geometry is a mathematical discipline that uses the techniques of differential calculus, integral calculus, linear algebra and multilinear algebra to study problems in geometry.  The theory of plane and space curves and surfaces in the three-dimensional Euclidean space formed the basis for development of differential geometry during the 18th century and the 19th century. Since the late 19th century, differential geometry has grown into a field concerned more generally with the geometric structures on differentiable manifolds.  Differential geometry is closely related to differential topology and the geometric aspects of the theory of differential equations.  The differential geometry of surfaces captures many of the key ideas and techniques characteristic of this field.

Diego Garcia<====>8630<====>Diego Garcia   Diego Garcia is an atoll just south of the equator in the central Indian Ocean, and the largest of 60 small islands comprising the Chagos Archipelago.  It was settled by the French in the 1790s and was transferred to British rule after the Napoleonic Wars.  It was one of the "Dependencies" of the British Colony of Mauritius until it was detached for inclusion in the newly created British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) in 1965.  Between 1968 and 1973, the population was forcibly removed by the United Kingdom and the United States to establish an American base through intimidation of locals and denying the return of any who left the island.

Door<====>8637<====>Door A door is a moving mechanism used to block off and allow access to, an entrance to or within an enclosed space, such as a building, room or vehicle.  Doors normally consist of one or two solid panels, with or without windows, that swing using hinges horizontally.  These hinges are attached to the door's edge but there are also doors that slide, fold or spin.  The main purpose of a door is to control physical access. Doors are significant in preventing the spread of fire and as a barrier to noise.  Many doors are equipped with locking mechanisms to allow entrance to certain people and keep out others. 

Database normalization<====>8640<====>Database normalization Database normalization, or simply normalization, is the process of restructuring a relational database in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.  It was first proposed by Edgar F.  Codd as an integral part of his relational model. Normalization entails organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a database to ensure that their dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity constraints.  It is accomplished by applying some formal rules either by a process of synthesis (creating a new database design) or decomposition (improving an existing database design). 

Desmothoracid<====>8641<====>Desmothoracid Order Desmothoracida, the desmothoracids, are a group of heliozoan protists, usually sessile and found in freshwater environments.  The adult is a spherical cell around 10-20 μm in diameter surrounded by a perforated organic lorica, or shell, with many radial pseudopods projecting through the holes to capture food.  These are supported by small bundles of microtubules that arise near a point on the nuclear membrane.   Unlike other heliozoans, the microtubules are not in any regular geometric array, there does not appear to be a microtubule organizing center, and there is no distinction between the outer and inner cytoplasm. 

Dalhousie University<====>8642<====>Dalhousie University   Dalhousie University (commonly known as Dal) is a public research university in Nova Scotia, Canada, with three campuses in Halifax, a fourth in Bible Hill, and medical teaching facilities in Saint John, New Brunswick.  Dalhousie offers more than 4,000 courses and 180 degree programs in twelve undergraduate, graduate, and professional faculties.   The university is a member of the U15, a group of research-intensive universities in Canada. Dalhousie was established as a nonsectarian college in 1818 by the eponymous Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie.  The college did not hold its first class until 1838, until then operating sporadically due to financial difficulties. 

Molecular diffusion<====>8643<====>Molecular diffusion Molecular diffusion, often simply called diffusion, is the thermal motion of all (liquid or gas) particles at temperatures above absolute zero.  The rate of this movement is a function of temperature, viscosity of the fluid and the size (mass) of the particles.  Diffusion explains the net flux of molecules from a region of higher concentration to one of lower concentration.  Once the concentrations are equal the molecules continue to move, but since there is no concentration gradient the process of molecular diffusion has ceased and is instead governed by the process of self-diffusion, originating from the random motion of the molecules. 

Declension<====>8645<====>Declension In linguistics, declension is the inflection (changing the form of a word) of nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, numerals, and articles to indicate number (at least singular and plural), case (nominative or subjective, genitive or possessive, etc. ), and/or gender.  A declension is also a group of nouns that follow a particular pattern of inflection. Declension occurs in many of the world's languages.  Among modern languages, declension is an important aspect of Arabic, Finnish, Turkish, many Amerindian languages such as Quechua, Bantu languages such as Zulu, Slavic languages such as Russian, some Germanic languages such as High German, and some others. 

Daffynition<====>8648<====>Daffynition A daffynition (derived from   and definition) is a pun format involving the reinterpretation of an existing word, on the basis that it sounds like another word (or group of words).  They are similar to transpositional puns, but often much less complex and easier to create.    Some daffynitions may be puns.  For example, "a hangover is the wrath of grapes" is a play on the title of the book The Grapes of Wrath.  A subclass of daffynition is the goofinition which relies strictly on literal associations and correct spellings, such as "lobster = a weak tennis player".

The most successful teams are Ajax (33), PSV (23) and Feyenoord (14).  Important teams of the past are HVV (10 titles), Sparta Rotterdam (6 titles) and Willem II (3 titles). The annual match that marks the beginning of the season is called the Johan Cruijff Schaal (Johan Cruyff Shield).  Contenders are the champions and the cup winners of the previous season. In women's football, the KNVB and its Belgian counterpart, the Royal Belgian Football Association (KBVB/URBSFA), jointly organize the top-level BeNe League. 

Dragon 32/64<====>8650<====>Dragon 32/64    The Dragon 32 and Dragon 64 are home computers that were built in the 1980s.  The Dragons are very similar to the TRS-80 Color Computer, and were produced for the European market by Dragon Data, Ltd. , in Port Talbot, Wales, and for the US market by Tano of New Orleans, Louisiana.  The model numbers reflect the primary difference between the two machines, which have 32 and 64 kilobytes of RAM, respectively. Product historyIn the early 1980s, the British home computer market was booming.  New machines were released almost monthly.  In August 1982, Dragon Data joined the fray with the Dragon 32; the Dragon 64 followed a year later. 

Dark matter<====>8651<====>Dark matter    Dark matter is a hypothetical type of matter distinct from ordinary matter such as protons, neutrons, electrons, and neutrinos. Dark matter has never been directly observed; however, its existence would explain a number of otherwise puzzling astronomical observations. The name refers to the fact that it does not emit or interact with observable electromagnetic radiation, such as light, and is thus invisible to the entire electromagnetic spectrum.    Although dark matter has not been directly observed, its existence and properties are inferred from unexplained mass in gravitational lensing calculations, which affects the motions of baryonic matter and light.

He served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate for six years.   Atchison served as a major general in the Missouri State Militia in 1838 during Missouri's Mormon War and as a Confederate brigadier general during the American Civil War under Major General Sterling Price in the Missouri Home Guard.  He is best known for the questionable claim that for one day (March 4, 1849) he may have been Acting President of the United States. 

Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit<====>8663<====>Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit  Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit ( ;  ; 24 May 1686 – 16 September 1736) was a Dutch-German-Polish physicist, inventor, and scientific instrument maker.  A pioneer of exact thermometry,  he helped lay the foundations for the era of precision thermometry by inventing the mercury-in-glass thermometer (first practical, accurate thermometer) and Fahrenheit scale (first standardized temperature scale to be widely used).  Encyclopædia Britannica  "Science & Technology: Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit" [1]  Fahrenheit was born in Danzig/Gdańsk, a predominantly German-speaking Hanseatic city in the Pomeranian Voivodeship of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, but lived most of his life in the Dutch Republic (1701–1736) and was one of the notable representatives in the Golden Age of Dutch science and technology.

It is supported by μClinux.  It was designed by Motorola in Hong Kong and released in 1995.  The DragonBall's major design win was in earlier versions of the Palm Computing platform; however, from Palm OS 5 onwards it has been superseded by ARM-based processors from Texas Instruments and Intel.  The processor is also used in some of the AlphaSmart line of portable word processors.  Examples include the Dana and Dana Wireless. 

Double-slit experiment<====>8667<====>Double-slit experiment  The modern double-slit experiment is a demonstration that light and matter can display characteristics of both classically defined waves and particles; moreover, it displays the fundamentally probabilistic nature of quantum mechanical phenomena.  The original experiment was performed by Davisson and Germer in 1927. A simpler form of the double-slit experiment was performed by Thomas Young in 1801 (well before quantum mechanics).  He believed it demonstrated that the wave theory of light was correct, and his experiment is sometimes referred to as Young's experiment .  While there is no doubt that Young's demonstration of optical interference, using sunlight, pinholes and cards, played a vital part in the acceptance of the wave theory of light, there is some question as to whether he ever actually performed a double-slit interference experiment.

Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications<====>8674<====>Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications  Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (Digital European Cordless Telecommunications), usually known by the acronym DECT, is a standard primarily used for creating cordless telephone systems.  It originated in Europe, where it is the universal standard, replacing earlier cordless phone standards, such as 900 MHz CT1 and CT2.    Beyond Europe, it has been adopted by Australia, and most countries in Asia and South America.  North American adoption was delayed by United States radio frequency regulations.  This forced development of a variation of DECT, called DECT 6. 0, using a slightly different frequency range which makes these units incompatible with systems intended for use in other areas, even from the same manufacturer.

Don't ask, don't tell<====>8690<====>Don't ask, don't tell"Don't ask, don't tell" (DADT) was the official United States policy on military service by gays, bisexuals, and lesbians, instituted by the Clinton Administration on February 28, 1994, when Department of Defense Directive 1304. 26 issued on December 21, 1993, took effect,  lasting until September 20, 2011.  The policy prohibited military personnel from discriminating against or harassing closeted homosexual or bisexual service members or applicants, while barring openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual persons from military service.  This relaxation of legal restrictions on service by gays and lesbians in the armed forces was mandated by United States federal law   ( ), which was signed November 30, 1993. 

Divination<====>8691<====>Divination   Divination (from Latin divinare "to foresee, to be inspired by a god",  related to divinus, divine) is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of an occultic, standardized process or ritual.   Used in various forms throughout history, diviners ascertain their interpretations of how a querent should proceed by reading signs, events, or omens, or through alleged contact with a supernatural agency.  Divination can be seen as a systematic method with which to organize what appear to be disjointed, random facets of existence such that they provide insight into a problem at hand. 

Diet of Nuremberg<====>8693<====>Diet of Nuremberg The Diets of Nuremberg, also called the Imperial Diets of Nuremberg, took place at different times between the Middle Ages and the 17th century.  The first Diet of Nuremberg, in 1211, elected the future emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen as German king. At the Diet of 1356 the Emperor Charles IV issued the Golden Bull of 1356, which required each Holy Roman Emperor to summon the first Imperial Diet after his election at Nuremberg.  Apart from that, a number of other diets were held there. Important to Protestantism (and the Turks)  were the Diets of 1522 ("First Diet of Nuremberg"), 1524 ("Second Diet of Nuremberg") and 1532 ("Third Diet of Nuremberg").

DNA ligase<====>8697<====>DNA ligaseDNA ligase is a specific type of enzyme, a ligase, ( ) that facilitates the joining of DNA strands together by catalyzing the formation of a phosphodiester bond.  It plays a role in repairing single-strand breaks in duplex DNA in living organisms, but some forms (such as DNA ligase IV) may specifically repair double-strand breaks (i. e.  a break in both complementary strands of DNA).  Single-strand breaks are repaired by DNA ligase using the complementary strand of the double helix as a template,    with DNA ligase creating the final phosphodiester bond to fully repair the DNA. 

Dewey Decimal Classification<====>8699<====>Dewey Decimal Classification  The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), or Dewey Decimal System, is a proprietary library classification system first published in the United States by Melvil Dewey in 1876.   It has been revised and expanded through 23 major editions, the latest issued in 2011, and has grown from a four-page pamphlet in 1876.  It is also available in an abridged version suitable for smaller libraries.  It is currently maintained by the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC), a non-profit cooperative that serves libraries.  OCLC licenses access to an online version for catalogers called WebDewey. The Decimal Classification introduced the concepts of relative location and relative index which allow new books to be added to a library in their appropriate location based on subject.

Darwin Awards<====>8703<====>Darwin Awards  The Darwin Awards are a tongue-in-cheek honor, originating in Usenet newsgroup discussions around 1985.  They recognize individuals who have supposedly contributed to human evolution by selecting themselves out of the gene pool via death or sterilization by their own actions. The project became more formalized with the creation of a website in 1993, and followed up by a series of books starting in 2000, authored by Wendy Northcutt.  The criterion for the awards states, "In the spirit of Charles Darwin, the Darwin Awards commemorate individuals who protect our gene pool by making the ultimate sacrifice of their own lives.

The story idea came from smuggling in the 18th century Romney Marsh,  where brandy and tobacco were brought in at night by boat from France to avoid high tax.  Minor battles were fought, sometimes at night, between gangs of smugglers, such as the Hawkhurst Gang, and the Revenue, supported by the army and local militias in the South, Kent and the West, Sussex. 

Dhrystone<====>8709<====>DhrystoneDhrystone is a synthetic computing benchmark program developed in 1984 by Reinhold P.  Weicker intended to be representative of system (integer) programming.  The Dhrystone grew to become representative of general processor (CPU) performance.  The name "Dhrystone" is a pun on a different benchmark algorithm called Whetstone.  With Dhrystone, Weicker gathered meta-data from a broad range of software, including programs written in FORTRAN, PL/1, SAL, ALGOL 68, and Pascal.  He then characterized these programs in terms of various common constructs: procedure calls, pointer indirections, assignments, etc.  From this he wrote the Dhrystone benchmark to correspond to a representative mix.

Doppler effect<====>8724<====>Doppler effect The Doppler effect (or the Doppler shift) is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave for an observer who is moving relative to the wave source.It is named after the Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, who described the phenomenon in 1842.  A common example of Doppler shift is the change of pitch heard when a vehicle sounding a horn approaches and recedes from an observer.  Compared to the emitted frequency, the received frequency is higher during the approach, identical at the instant of passing by, and lower during the recession.

Volkssturm<====>8730<====>Volkssturm  The Volkssturm ( , "people's storm"  ) was a national militia established by Nazi Germany during the last months of World War II.  It was not set up by the German Army, the ground component of the combined German Wehrmacht armed forces, but by the Nazi Party on the orders of Adolf Hitler and its official existence was not announced until 16 October 1944.  Burleigh (2001).  The Third Reich: A New History, p.  786.   It was staffed by conscripting males between the ages of 16 and 60 years who were not already serving in some military unit as part of a German Home Guard. 

Director's cut<====>8731<====>Director's cut  A director's cut is an edited version of a film (or television episode, music video, commercial, or video game) that is supposed to represent the director's own approved edit.  'Cut' explicitly refers to the process of film editing; in preparing a film for release, the director's cut is preceded by the assembly and rough editor's cut and usually followed by the final cut meant for the public film release. Director's cuts of film are not generally released to the public, because on most films the director does not have a final cut privilege.  The production company, distributors, and/or studio (anybody with money invested in the film) can impose changes that they think will make the film profit more at the box office. 

Digital video<====>8733<====>Digital video   Digital video is a representation of moving visual images in the form of encoded digital data.  This is in contrast to analog video, which represents moving visual images with analog signals.  Digital video comprises a series of digital images displayed in rapid succession.  In contrast, one of the key analog methods, motion picture film, uses a series of photographs which are projected in rapid succession.  Standard film stocks such as 16 mm and 35 mm record at 24 frames per second.  For video, there are two frame rate standards: NTSC, at about 30 frames per second, and PAL at 25 frames per second. 

BIND<====>8735<====>BIND  BIND  , or named  , is the most widely used Domain Name System (DNS) software on the Internet.   On Unix-like operating systems it is the de facto standard.  The software was originally designed at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) in the early 1980s.  The name originates as an acronym of Berkeley Internet Name Domain,    reflecting the application's use within UCB.  The software consists, most prominently, of the DNS server component, called named, a contracted form of name daemon.  In addition the suite contains various administration tools, and a DNS resolver interface library. 

Djbdns<====>8736<====>Djbdns  The djbdns software package is a DNS implementation.  It was created by Daniel J.  Bernstein in response to his frustrations with repeated security holes in the widely used BIND DNS software.  As a challenge, Bernstein offered a $1000 prize    for the first person to find a security hole in djbdns, which was awarded    in March 2009 to Matthew Dempsky.  , djbdns's tinydns component was the second most popular DNS server in terms of the number of domains for which it was the authoritative server, and third most popular in terms of the number of DNS hosts running it. 

Dylan (programming language)<====>8741<====>Dylan (programming language)  Dylan   is a multi-paradigm programming language that includes support for functional and object-oriented programming, and is dynamic and reflective while providing a programming model designed to support efficient machine code generation, including fine-grained control over dynamic and static behaviors.  It was created in the early 1990s by a group led by Apple Computer. A concise and thorough overview of the language may be found in the Dylan Reference Manual.  Dylan derives from Scheme and Common Lisp and adds an integrated object system derived from the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS).  In Dylan, all values (including numbers, characters, functions, and classes) are first-class objects. 

Dublin Core<====>8742<====>Dublin Core The Dublin Core Schema is a small set of vocabulary terms that can be used to describe web resources (video, images, web pages, etc. ), as well as physical resources such as books or CDs, and objects like artworks.   The full set of Dublin Core metadata terms can be found on the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) website.   The original set of 15 classic  metadata terms, known as the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES),    is endorsed in the following standards documents:IETF RFC 5013 ISO Standard 15836-2009 NISO Standard Z39. 

Document Object Model<====>8743<====>Document Object Model    The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent application programming interface that treats a HTML, XHTML, or XML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document.  The objects can be manipulated programmatically and any visible changes occurring as a result may then be reflected in the display of the document.    The principal standardization of DOM was handled by the World Wide Web Consortium, which last developed a recommendation in 2004.  WHATWG took over development of the standard, publishing it as a living document. 

Design pattern<====>8745<====>Design pattern A design pattern is the re-usable form of a solution to a design problem.  The idea was introduced by the architect Christopher Alexander Alexander, A Pattern Language  and has been adapted for various other disciplines, most notably computer science.  Gamma et al. , 1994, Design Patterns (the "Gang of Four" book) DetailsAn organized collection of design patterns that relate to a particular field is called a pattern language.  This language gives a common terminology for discussing the situations designers are faced with.  Documenting a pattern requires explaining why a particular situation causes problems, and how the components of the pattern relate to each other to give the solution. 

N,N-Dimethyltryptamine<====>8748<====>N,N-Dimethyltryptamine DISPLAYTITLE  N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT or N,N-DMT) is a tryptamine molecule which occurs in many plants and animals.   It can be consumed as a powerful psychedelic drug and has historically been prepared by various cultures for ritual and healing purposes.Rick Strassman labeled it "the spirit molecule".   In most countries, DMT is illegal. DMT has a relatively short duration of action, intense effects and rapid onset.  For that reason, DMT was known as the "businessman's trip" during the 1960s in the United States, as a user could access the full depth of a psychedelic experience in considerably less time than with other substances such as LSD or magic mushrooms. 

Da capo<====>8750<====>Da capo   Da capo,  , is an Italian musical term that means "from the beginning"  (literally, "from the head").  It is often abbreviated as D. C.  The term is a directive to repeat the previous part of music, often used to save space, and thus is an easier way of saying to repeat the music from the beginning. In small pieces, this might be the same thing as a repeat.  But in larger works, D. C.  might occur after one or more repeats of small sections, indicating a return to the very beginning. 

Dominatrix<====>8751<====>Dominatrix  A dominatrix ( ), plural dominatrixes or dominatrices ( ), is a woman who takes the dominant role in BDSM activities.  A dominatrix might be of any sexual orientation, but her orientation does not necessarily limit the genders of her submissive partners.  The role of a dominatrix may not even involve physical pain toward the submissive; her domination can be verbal, involving humiliating tasks, or servitude.  A dominatrix is typically a paid professional ("pro-domme") as the term "dominatrix" is little-used within the non-professional BDSM scene. The term domme is a coined pseudo-French female variation of the slang dom (short for dominant). 

Flag of Denmark<====>8752<====>Flag of Denmark The flag of Denmark ( ,  ) The word Dannebrog is recorded since the 16th century, and in the opinion of  A. D.  Jørgensen ("Om Danebroges Oprindelse",  Historiske Afhandlinger 2, 1899) the word may be of medieval coinage. Old Danish brog continues Old Norse brók "piece of cloth; breeches, trousers"; the word is not now current in Danish outside of composition,   the Ordbog over det danske Sprog (1920 edition) listed it as "dated or poetic" (foræld.  og poet. ) for "trousers".   is red with a white Scandinavian cross that extends to the edges of the flag; the vertical part of the cross is shifted to the hoist side. 

Dharma<====>8753<====>Dharma  Dharma (  ,  ;  ,  , translit.  dhamma) is a key concept with multiple meanings in the Indian religions – Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism  and Jainism.There is no single-word translation for Dharma in Western languages.  In Hinduism, Dharma signifies behaviors that are considered to be in accord with rta, the order that makes life and universe possible,   and includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and "right way of living".  see:"Dharma", The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th Ed.  (2013), Columbia University Press, Gale,  ;Steven Rosen (2006), Essential Hinduism, Praeger,  , Chapter 3. 

Daniel Dennett<====>8756<====>Daniel Dennett  Daniel Clement Dennett III (born March 28, 1942)   is an American philosopher, writer, and cognitive scientist whose research centers on the philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, and philosophy of biology, particularly as those fields relate to evolutionary biology and cognitive science.  As of 2017, he is the co-director of the Center for Cognitive Studies and the Austin B.  Fletcher Professor of Philosophy at Tufts University.  Dennett is an atheist and secularist, a member of the Secular Coalition for America advisory board,  and a member of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, as well as an outspoken supporter of the Brights movement. 

Darwin's Dangerous Idea<====>8757<====>Darwin's Dangerous Idea  Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life is a 1995 book by Daniel Dennett, in which Dennett looks at some of the repercussions of Darwinian theory.  The crux of the argument is that, whether or not Darwin's theories are overturned, there is no going back from the dangerous idea that design (purpose or what something is for) might not need a designer.  Dennett makes this case on the basis that natural selection is a blind process, which is nevertheless sufficiently powerful to explain the evolution of life.  Darwin's discovery was that the generation of life worked algorithmically, that processes behind it work in such a way that given these processes the results that they tend toward must be so. 

Douglas Hofstadter<====>8758<====>Douglas Hofstadter Douglas Richard Hofstadter (born February 15, 1945) is an American professor of cognitive science whose research focuses on the sense of "I" (sense of self in relation to the external world),   consciousness, analogy-making, artistic creation, literary translation, and discovery in mathematics and physics.

Dahomey<====>8765<====>Dahomey    The Kingdom of Dahomey ( ) was an African kingdom (located in the area of the present-day country of Benin) that existed from about 1600 until 1894, when the last king, Béhanzin, was defeated by the French, and the country was annexed into the French colonial empire.  Dahomey developed on the Abomey Plateau amongst the Fon people in the early 17th century and became a regional power in the 18th century by conquering key cities on the Atlantic coast. For much of the 18th and 19th centuries, the Kingdom of Dahomey was a key regional state, eventually ending tributary status to the Oyo Empire. 

Dragoon<====>8767<====>Dragoon  Dragoons originally were a class of mounted infantry, who used horses for mobility but dismounted to fight on foot.   From the early 18th century onward, dragoons were increasingly employed as conventional light or medium cavalry, trained for combat with swords from horseback.  Dragoon regiments were established in most European armies during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The name is derived from a type of firearm, called a "dragon", which was a handgun version of a blunderbuss, carried by dragoons of the French Army.   The title has been retained in modern times by a number of armoured or ceremonial mounted regiments. 

Dulcimer<====>8768<====>Dulcimer A dulcimer is a type of musical string instrument.  It is a species of zither.  Among its forms are:Hammered dulcimer, free-standing, most frequently but not always trapezoidal in shape, with many strings struck by handheld "hammers".  This type of instrument is found in many cultures, especially in England, in the British Isles and in the north of continental Europe.  Most countries have their own name for the instrument, for instance in Thailand it is called a khim, in India it is called Santoor and many have different tuning systems.  Being a struck string instrument, it is considered to be among the ancestors of the piano. 

Dutch West India Company<====>8769<====>Dutch West India Company Dutch West India Company ( ,   or  ;  ) was a chartered company (known as the "WIC") of Dutch merchants as well as foreign investors.  Among its founders was Willem Usselincx (1567–1647).   On June 3, 1621, it was granted a charter for a trade monopoly in the Dutch West Indies by the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands and given jurisdiction over Dutch participation in the Atlantic slave trade, Brazil, the Caribbean, and North America.  The area where the company could operate consisted of West Africa (between the Tropic of Cancer and the Cape of Good Hope) and the Americas, which included the Pacific Ocean and the eastern part of New Guinea. 

Dyula language<====>8771<====>Dyula language    Jula (or Dyula, Dioula) is a Mande language spoken in Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and Mali.  It is one of the Manding languages and is most closely related to Bambara, being mutually intelligible with Bambara as well as Malinke.  It is a trade language in West Africa and is spoken by millions of people, either as a first or second language.  It is written in the Arabic script and the Latin script, as well as in the indigenous N'Ko script. A movie spoken in Dyula is Fanta Régina Nacro's Night of Truth. 

Desi Arnaz<====>8774<====>Desi Arnaz    Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Acha III (March 2, 1917 – December 2, 1986), better known as Desi Arnaz or Desi Arnaz, Sr. , was a Cuban-born American actor, musician, and television producer.  He is best remembered for his role as Ricky Ricardo on the American television series sitcom I Love Lucy.  He co-starred on that show with Lucille Ball, to whom he was married at the time.  He and Ball are generally credited as the inventors of the syndicated rerun, which they pioneered with the I Love Lucy series.    Arnaz and Lucille Ball cofounded and ran the television production company Desilu Productions, originally to market I Love Lucy to television networks. 

DNA virus<====>8777<====>DNA virusA DNA virus is a virus that has DNA as its genetic material and replicates using a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase.  The nucleic acid is usually double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) but may also be single-stranded DNA (ssDNA).  DNA viruses belong to either Group I or Group II of the Baltimore classification system for viruses.  Single-stranded DNA is usually expanded to double-stranded in infected cells.  Although Group VII viruses such as hepatitis B contain a DNA genome, they are not considered DNA viruses according to the Baltimore classification, but rather reverse transcribing viruses because they replicate through an RNA intermediate. 

Daniel Ortega<====>8778<====>Daniel Ortega   José Daniel Ortega Saavedra ( ; born November 11, 1945) is a Nicaraguan politician who has been President of Nicaragua since 2007; previously he was leader of Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990, first as Coordinator of the Junta of National Reconstruction (1979–1985) and then as President (1985–1990).  A leader in the socialist Sandinista National Liberation Front (Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional, FSLN), his policies in government have seen the implementation of leftist reforms across Nicaragua. Born into a working-class family, from an early age Ortega opposed ruling President Anastasio Somoza Debayle, widely recognized as a dictator, and became involved in the underground movement against his regime. 

Destroyer<====>8779<====>Destroyer In naval terminology, a destroyer is a fast, maneuverable long-endurance warship intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet, convoy or battle group and defend them against smaller powerful short-range attackers.  They were originally developed in the late 19th century as a defence against torpedo boats, and by the time of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, these "torpedo boat destroyers" (TBDs) were "large, swift, and powerfully armed torpedo boats designed to destroy other torpedo boats. "  Although the term "destroyer" had been used interchangeably with "TBD" and "torpedo boat destroyer" by navies since 1892, the term "torpedo boat destroyer" had been generally shortened to simply "destroyer" by nearly all navies by the First World War. 

Debian GNU/Hurd<====>8780<====>Debian GNU/Hurd  Debian GNU/Hurd is the Debian project's distribution of the GNU operating system, using the GNU Hurd microkernel. Debian GNU/Hurd has been in development since 1998,    and made a formal release in May 2013, with 78% of the software packaged for Debian GNU/Linux ported to the GNU Hurd.The Debian GNU/Hurd developers were hoping to be able to release it with Debian "Wheezy"   in 2013.   However, Hurd is not yet an official Debian release, and is maintained and developed as an unofficial port. According to the GNU/Hurd compatibility guide, the current version is compatible with laptops but there is no PCMCIA support yet. 

Dorothy Parker<====>8781<====>Dorothy Parker  Dorothy Parker (August 22, 1893 – June 7, 1967) was an American poet, writer, critic, and satirist, best known for her wit, wisecracks and eye for 20th-century urban foibles. From a conflicted and unhappy childhood, Parker rose to acclaim, both for her literary output in publications such as The New Yorker and as a founding member of the Algonquin Round Table.  Following the breakup of the circle, Parker traveled to Hollywood to pursue screenwriting.  Her successes there, including two Academy Award nominations, were curtailed when her involvement in left-wing politics led to a place on the Hollywood blacklist. 

Dylan Thomas<====>8783<====>Dylan Thomas    Dylan Marlais Thomas (27 October 1914 – 9 November 1953) was a Welsh poet and writer whose works include the poems "Do not go gentle into that good night" and "And death shall have no dominion"; the 'play for voices' Under Milk Wood; and stories and radio broadcasts such as A Child's Christmas in Wales and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog.  He became widely popular in his lifetime and remained so after his premature death at the age of 39 in New York City.  By then he had acquired a reputation, which he had encouraged, as a "roistering, drunken and doomed poet". 

Fern Hill<====>8785<====>Fern HillFern Hill (1945) is a poem by Dylan Thomas, first published in the October, 1945, Horizon magazine, with its first book publication as the last poem in Deaths and Entrances. The house Fernhill is just outside Llangain in Carmarthenshire.  Thomas had extended stays here in the 1920s with his aunt Annie and her husband, Jim Jones.  His holidays here have been recalled in interviews with his schoolboy friends, and both the house and the Thomas family network in the area are detailed in the same book.  Linguistic considerationsThe poem starts as a straightforward evocation of his childhood visits to his Aunt Annie's farm:Now as I was young and easy under the apple boughsAbout the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,The night above the dingle starry,In the middle section, the idyllic scene is expanded upon, reinforced by the lilting rhythm of the poem, the dreamlike, pastoral metaphors and allusion to Eden.

Detroit Red Wings<====>8795<====>Detroit Red Wings  The Detroit Red Wings are a professional ice hockey team based in Detroit.  They are members of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL)  and are one of the Original Six teams of the league.   Founded in 1926, the team was known as the Detroit Cougars from then until 1930.  For the 1930–31 and 1931–32 seasons the team was called the Detroit Falcons, and in 1932 changed their name to the Red Wings., the Red Wings have won the most Stanley Cup championships of any NHL franchise based in the United States (11)  and are third overall in total Stanley Cup championships, behind the Montreal Canadiens (24) and Toronto Maple Leafs (13). 

Demiurge<====>8796<====>Demiurge   In the Platonic, Neopythagorean, Middle Platonic, and Neoplatonic schools of philosophy, the demiurge ( ) is an artisan-like figure responsible for fashioning and maintaining the physical universe.  The term was adopted by the Gnostics.  Although a fashioner, the demiurge is not necessarily the same as the creator figure in the monotheistic sense, because the demiurge itself and the material from which the demiurge fashions the universe are both considered to be consequences of something else.  Depending on the system, they may be considered to be either uncreated and eternal, or considered to be the product of some other entity. 

Doubravka of Bohemia<====>8798<====>Doubravka of Bohemia  Doubravka of Bohemia or Dobrawa, Dąbrówka ( ,  ) (ca.  940/45 – 977) was a Bohemian princess of the Přemyslid dynasty and by marriage Duchess of the Polans. She was the daughter of Boleslav I the Cruel, Duke of Bohemia, whose wife may have been the mysterious Biagota.According to earlier sources, Dobrawa urged her husband Mieszko I of Poland to accept baptism in 966, the year after their marriage.  Modern historians believe, however, that the change of religion by Mieszko was one of the points discussed in the Polish-Bohemian agreement concluded soon before his marriage with Dobrawa. 

D. B. Cooper<====>8799<====>D.  B.  Cooper    D.  B.  Cooper is a media epithet popularly used to refer to an unidentified man who hijacked a Boeing 727 aircraft in the airspace between Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington, on November 24, 1971.  He extorted $200,000 in ransom ( ) and parachuted to an uncertain fate.  Despite an extensive manhunt and protracted FBI investigation, the perpetrator has never been located or identified.  The case remains the only unsolved air piracy in commercial aviation history.    While available evidence and a preponderance of expert opinion suggested from the beginning that Cooper probably did not survive his high-risk jump,  the FBI nevertheless maintained an active investigation for 45 years following the hijacking. 

Distributism<====>8805<====>Distributism Distributism (also known as distributionism  or distributivism)  is an economic ideology that developed in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century based upon the principles of Catholic social teaching, especially the teachings of Pope Leo XIII in his  encyclical Rerum novarum and Pope Pius XI in Quadragesimo anno.   Many  Christian Democratic political parties have advocated for distributism in their economic policies.OverviewAccording to distributists, property ownership is a fundamental right,  and the means of production should be spread as widely as possible, rather than being centralized under the control of the state (state socialism), a few individuals (plutocracy), or corporations (corporatocracy). 

Dehydroepiandrosterone<====>8807<====>Dehydroepiandrosterone {{Chembox }}Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), also known as androstenolone, is an endogenous steroid hormone.   It is one of the most abundant circulating steroids in humans,  in whom it is produced in the adrenal glands,  the gonads, and the brain,  where it functions as a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of the androgen and estrogen sex steroids. However, DHEA also has a variety of potential biological effects in its own right, binding to an array of nuclear and cell surface receptors,    and acting as a neurosteroid and neurotrophin. 

Discrete Fourier transform<====>8811<====>Discrete Fourier transform  In mathematics, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) converts a finite sequence of equally-spaced samples of a function into a same-length sequence of equally-spaced samples of the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT), which is a complex-valued function of frequency.  The interval at which the DTFT is sampled is the reciprocal of the duration of the input sequence.   An inverse DFT is a Fourier series, using the DTFT samples as coefficients of complex sinusoids at the corresponding DTFT frequencies.   It has the same sample-values as the original input sequence.   The DFT is therefore said to be a frequency domain representation of the original input sequence. 

Dual polyhedron<====>8815<====>Dual polyhedronIn geometry, any polyhedron is associated with a second dual figure, where the vertices of one correspond to the faces of the other and the edges between pairs of vertices of one correspond to the edges between pairs of faces of the other.   Such dual figures remain combinatorial or abstract polyhedra, but not all are also geometric polyhedra.   Starting with any given polyhedron, the dual of its dual is the original polyhedron. Duality preserves the symmetries of a polyhedron.  Therefore, for many classes of polyhedra defined by their symmetries, the duals also belong to a symmetric class. 

Double bass<====>8816<====>Double bass  The double bass, or simply the bass (and numerous other names), is the largest and lowest-pitched bowed string instrument in the modern symphony orchestra.  It is a transposing instrument and is typically notated one octave higher than tuned to avoid excessive ledger lines below the staff.  The double bass is the only modern bowed string instrument that is tuned in fourths (like a viol), rather than fifths, with strings usually tuned to E 1 , A 1 , D 2  and G 2 .  The instrument's exact lineage is still a matter of some debate, with scholars divided on whether the bass is derived from the viol or the violin family. 

Deicide (band)<====>8817<====>Deicide (band) Deicide is an American death metal band formed in 1987 by brothers and guitarists Brian and Eric Hoffman and drummer Steve Asheim as "Carnage", then hiring bassist/vocalist Glen Benton and becoming "Amon".  They would later change the band name to Deicide in 1989.  The band rose to mainstream success in 1992 with their second album Legion,  and is credited as the second best-selling death metal band of the Soundscan Era, after Cannibal Corpse.Since their debut album in 1990, Deicide has released eleven studio albums, one live album, two compilation albums and two live DVDs.

Division of labour<====>8824<====>Division of labour   The division of labour is the separation of tasks in any  system so that participants may specialize.   Individuals, organisations, and nations are endowed with or acquire specialized capabilities and either form combinations or trade to take advantage of the capabilities of others in addition to their own.  Specialized capabilities may include equipment or natural resources in addition to skills and training and complex combinations of such assets are often important, as when multiple items of specialized equipment and skilled operators are used to produce a single product.  The division of labour is the motive for trade and the source of economic interdependence.

Brief History of the Miner's Flame Safety Lamp at minerslamps. net.  Accessed 7 July 20121  It consists of a wick lamp with the flame enclosed inside a mesh screen.  It was created for use in coal mines, to reduce the danger of explosions due to the presence of methane and other flammable gases, called firedamp or minedamp. History Davy's invention was preceded by that of William Reid Clanny, an Irish doctor at Bishopwearmouth, who had read a paper to the Royal Society in May 1813. 

Docklands Light Railway<====>8827<====>Docklands Light Railway    The Docklands Light Railway (DLR) is an automated light metro system opened in 1987 to serve the redeveloped Docklands area of East London, England.   It reaches north to Stratford, south to Lewisham across the River Thames, west to   and   in the City of London financial district, and east to Beckton, London City Airport, and to Woolwich Arsenal south of the river. The system uses minimal staffing on trains and at major interchange stations; the four below-ground stations are staffed to comply with underground station fire and safety requirements. 

Dundee<====>8828<====>DundeeDundee ( ;    ), officially the City of Dundee, is Scotland's fourth-largest city and the 51st-most-populous built-up area in the United Kingdom.  The mid-year population estimate for 2016 was 148,270, giving Dundee a population density of 2,478/km 2  or 6,420/sq mi, the second-highest in Scotland.  It lies within the eastern central Lowlands on the north bank of the Firth of Tay, which feeds into the North Sea.

Do Not Adjust Your Set<====>8829<====>Do Not Adjust Your Set   Do Not Adjust Your Set (DNAYS) was a television series produced originally by Rediffusion, London, then, by the fledgling Thames Television for British commercial television channel ITV from 26 December 1967 to 14 May 1969.  The show took its name from the message (frequently seen on the TV screen in those days) which was displayed when there was a problem with transmission. It included early appearances of Denise Coffey, David Jason, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin; the last three became members of the Monty Python comedy troupe soon afterwards.  Although originally conceived as a children's programme, it quickly acquired a following amongst many adults, including future Pythons John Cleese and Graham Chapman (as mentioned by Cleese himself in the "Paying my ex-wife" stage performance tour, October 2010). 

West Memphis Three<====>8832<====>West Memphis ThreeThe West Memphis Three are three men who – while teenagers – were tried and convicted, in 1994, of the 1993 murders of three boys in West Memphis, Arkansas.  Damien Echols was sentenced to death, Jessie Misskelley, Jr.  was sentenced to life imprisonment plus two 20-year sentences, and Jason Baldwin was sentenced to life imprisonment.  During the trial, the prosecution asserted that the children were killed as part of a Satanic ritual. A number of documentaries have explored the case.  Celebrities and musicians have held fundraisers in the belief that the three young men convicted of the crime are innocent.

David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty<====>8837<====>David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty   Admiral of the Fleet David Richard Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty   (17 January 1871 – 11 March 1936) was a Royal Navy officer.  After serving in the Mahdist War and then the response to the Boxer Rebellion, he commanded the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron at the Battle of Jutland in 1916, a tactically indecisive engagement after which his aggressive approach was contrasted with the caution of his commander Admiral Sir John Jellicoe.  He is remembered for his comment at Jutland that "There seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today", after two of his ships exploded. 

Dictum of Kenilworth<====>8838<====>Dictum of Kenilworth The Dictum of Kenilworth, issued on 31 October 1266, was a pronouncement designed to reconcile the rebels of the Barons' War with the royal government of England.  After the baronial victory at the Battle of Lewes in 1264, Simon de Montfort took control of royal government, but at the Battle of Evesham the next year Montfort was killed, and King Henry III restored to power.  A group of rebels held out in the stronghold of Kenilworth Castle, however, and their resistance proved hard to crush. A siege of the castle was started, but through papal intervention King Henry later entered on a more conciliatory path. 

London Docklands<====>8839<====>London Docklands   London Docklands is the name for the riverfront and former docks in London, the capital of the United Kingdom.  Situated in east and southeast London, it forms part of the boroughs of Southwark, Tower Hamlets, Lewisham, Newham and Greenwich.  The docks were formerly part of the Port of London, at one time the world's largest port.  Following the closure of the docks, the area became derelict and poverty-ridden by the 1980s.  The Docklands' regeneration began later that decade; it has now been redeveloped principally for commercial and residential use.  The name London Docklands was used for the first time in a government report on redevelopment plans in 1971, and has since become virtually universally adopted. 

Diesel multiple unit<====>8840<====>Diesel multiple unit   A diesel multiple unit or DMU is a multiple-unit train powered by on-board diesel engines.  A DMU requires no separate locomotive, as the engines are incorporated into one or more of the carriages.  Diesel-powered single-unit railcars are also generally classed as DMUs.  Diesel-powered units may be further classified by their transmission type: diesel–electric (DEMU), diesel–mechanical (DMMU) or diesel–hydraulic (DHMU). DesignThe diesel engine may be located above the frame in an engine bay or under the floor.  Driving controls can be at both ends, on one end, or in a separate car. 

Donald A. Wollheim<====>8843<====>Donald A.  Wollheim  Donald Allen Wollheim (October 1, 1914 – November 2, 1990) was an American science fiction editor, publisher, writer, and fan.  As an author, he published under his own name as well as under pseudonyms, including David Grinnell.    A founding member of the Futurians, he was a leading influence on science fiction development and fandom in the 20th century United States.  Ursula K.  Le Guin called Wollheim "the tough, reliable editor of Ace Books, in the Late Pulpalignean Era, 1966 and ’67, " which is when he published her first two novels, in an Ace Double. 

Digital cinema<====>8844<====>Digital cinema Digital cinema refers to the use of digital technology to distribute or project motion pictures as opposed to the historical use of reels of motion picture film, such as 35 mm film.  Whereas film reels have to be shipped to movie theaters, a digital movie can be distributed to cinemas in a number of ways: over the Internet or dedicated satellite links, or by sending hard drives or optical discs such as Blu-ray discs.  Digital movies are projected using a digital video projector instead of a film projector.  Digital cinema is distinct from high-definition television and does not necessarily use traditional television or other traditional high-definition video standards, aspect ratios, or frame rates. 

Democratic Progressive Party<====>8845<====>Democratic Progressive PartyThe Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is a liberal , anti-communist political party in Taiwan, and the dominant party in the Pan-Green Coalition.  It is currently the majority ruling party, controlling both the presidency and the unicameral Legislative Yuan. Founded in 1986, the DPP is one of two major parties in Taiwan, along with the historically dominant Kuomintang.  It has traditionally been associated with strong advocacy of human rights, anti-communism and a distinct Taiwanese identity.  The current leader is President Tsai Ing-wen, the second member of the DPP to hold the office. 

Datura<====>8846<====>Datura    Datura is a genus of nine species of poisonous vespertine flowering plants belonging to the family Solanaceae.  They are commonly known as daturas, but also known as devil's trumpets,  not to be confused with angel's trumpets, its closely related genus Brugmansia.  They are also sometimes called moonflowers, jimsonweed, devil's weed, hell's bells, thorn-apple, and many more.  Its precise and natural distribution is uncertain, owing to its extensive cultivation and naturalization throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the globe.  Its distribution within the Americas and North Africa, however, is most likely restricted to the United States and Mexico and Southern Canada in North America, and Tunisia in Africa, where the highest species diversity occurs. 

Commutator subgroup<====>8847<====>Commutator subgroupIn mathematics, more specifically in abstract algebra, the commutator subgroup or derived subgroup of a group is the subgroup generated by all the commutators of the group.   The commutator subgroup is important because it is the smallest normal subgroup such that the quotient group of the original group by this subgroup is abelian.  In other words, G/N is abelian if and only if N contains the commutator subgroup.  So in some sense it provides a measure of how far the group is from being abelian; the larger the commutator subgroup is, the "less abelian" the group is.

Digital compositing<====>8858<====>Digital compositing Digital compositing is the process of digitally assembling multiple images to make a final image, typically for print, motion pictures or screen display.   It is the digital analogue of optical film compositing. MathematicsThe basic operation used in digital compositing is known as 'alpha blending', where an opacity value, 'α', is used to control the proportions of two input pixel values that end up a single output pixel. As a simple example, suppose two images of the same size are available and they are to be composited.  The input images are referred to as the foreground image and the background image. 

Dandy<====>8859<====>Dandy A dandy, historically, is a man who places particular importance upon physical appearance, refined language, and leisurely hobbies, pursued with the appearance of nonchalance in a cult of self.A dandy could be a self-made man who strove to imitate an aristocratic lifestyle despite coming from a middle-class background, especially in late 18th- and early 19th-century Britain. Previous manifestations of the petit-maître (French for small master) and the Muscadin have been noted by John C.  Prevost,  but the modern practice of dandyism first appeared in the revolutionary 1790s, both in London and in Paris. 

Dubbing (filmmaking)<====>8860<====>Dubbing (filmmaking)    Dubbing, mixing or re-recording is a post-production process used in filmmaking and video production in which additional or supplementary recordings are "mixed" with original production sound to create the finished soundtrack. The process usually takes place on a dub stage.  After sound editors edit and prepare all the necessary tracks – dialogue, automated dialogue replacement (ADR), effects, Foley, music – the dubbing mixers proceed to balance all of the elements and record the finished soundtrack.  Dubbing is sometimes confused with ADR, also known as "additional dialogue replacement", "automated dialogue recording", and "looping",   in which the original actors re-record and synchronize audio segments. 

Delaunay triangulation<====>8864<====>Delaunay triangulation In mathematics and computational geometry,  a Delaunay triangulation (also known as a Delone triangulation) for a given set P of discrete points in a plane is a triangulation DT(P) such that no point in P is inside the circumcircle of any triangle in DT(P).  Delaunay triangulations maximize the minimum angle of all the angles of the triangles in the triangulation; they tend to avoid sliver triangles.  The triangulation is named after Boris Delaunay for his work on this topic from 1934.    For a set of points on the same line there is no Delaunay triangulation (the notion of triangulation is degenerate for this case). 

Defendant<====>8865<====>DefendantA defendant is a person accused of   committing a crime in criminal prosecution or a person against whom some type of civil relief is being sought in a civil case. Terminology varies from one jurisdiction to another.  For example, Scots law does not use the term "defendant"; the terms "accused" or "panel" are used instead in criminal proceedings, and "defender" in civil proceedings.  Criminal defendantsIn a criminal trial, a defendant is a person accused (charged) of committing an offense (a crime; an act defined as punishable under criminal law).  The other party to a criminal trial is usually a public prosecutor, but in some jurisdictions, private prosecutions are allowed. 

Domitius Afer<====>8873<====>Domitius AferGnaeus Domitius Afer (died 59) was a Roman orator and advocate, born at Nemausus (Nîmes) in Gallia Narbonensis.   He flourished in the reigns of Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero.  LifeHe became praetor in 25 AD, and gained the favor of Tiberius by accusing Claudia Pulchra, the second cousin of Agrippina, of adultery and the use of magic arts against the emperor, in 26 AD.  Tacitus, Annales iv. 52   From this time he became one of the most celebrated orators in Rome, but sacrificed his character by conducting accusations for the government.   In the following year, 27 AD, he is again mentioned by Tacitus as the accuser of Quinctilius Varus, the son of Claudia Pulchra.

Recreational use of dextromethorphan<====>8879<====>Recreational use of dextromethorphan  Dextromethorphan, or DXM, a common active ingredient found in many over-the-counter cough suppressant cold medicines, is used as a recreational drug and entheogen for its dissociative effects.   It has almost no psychoactive effects at medically recommended doses.  Dextromethorphan has powerful dissociative properties when administered in doses well above those considered therapeutic for cough suppression.Recreational use of DXM is sometimes referred to in slang form as "robo-tripping," whose prefix derives from the Robitussin brand name, or Triple Cs, which derives from the Coricidin brand.  (The pills were printed with "CCC" for "Coricidin Cough and Cold.

Doctor (title)<====>8881<====>Doctor (title)   Doctor is an academic title that originates from the Latin word of the same spelling and meaning.   The word is originally an agentive noun of the Latin verb'to teach'.  It has been used as an academic title in Europe since the 13th century, when the first doctorates were awarded at the University of Bologna and the University of Paris.  Having become established in European universities, this usage spread around the world.  Contracted "Dr" or "Dr. ", it is used as a designation for a person who has obtained a Doctorate (e.

He followed his brother Kenneth I to the Pictish throne. ReignThe Chronicle of the Kings of Alba says that Domnall reigned for four years, matching the notices in the Annals of Ulster of his brother's death in February 858 and his own in April 862.   The Chronicle notes: The laws of Áed Find are entirely lost, but it has been assumed that, like the laws attributed to Giric and Constantine II (Causantín mac Áeda), these related to the church and in particular to granting the privileges and immunities common elsewhere. 

Danse Macabre<====>8884<====>Danse MacabreThe Danse Macabre (from the French language), also called the Dance of Death, is an artistic genre of allegory of the Late Middle Ages on the universality of death: no matter one's station in life, the Dance Macabre unites all. The Danse Macabre consists of the dead or a personification of death summoning representatives from all walks of life to dance along to the grave, typically with a pope, emperor, king, child, and laborer.  They were produced as mementos mori, to remind people of the fragility of their lives and how vain were the glories of earthly life. 

David Abercromby<====>8885<====>David Abercromby David Abercromby was a 17th-century Scottish physician and writer, thought to have died in 1702.  Andrew Pyle (editor), Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers (2000), article pp.  2-7.    Brought up at Douai as a Roman Catholic by Jesuit priests, he was converted to Protestantism in 1682 and came to abjure popery, and published Protestancy proved Safer than Popery (1686). WorksHis medical reputation was based on his Tuta ac efficax luis venereae saepe absque mercurio ac semper absque salivatione mercuriali curando methodus (1684) which was translated into French, Dutch and German.   Two other works by him were De Pulsus Variatione (1685), and Ars explorandi medicas facultates plantarum ex solo sapore (1688); his Opuscula were collected in 1687. 

Deconstruction<====>8886<====>Deconstruction  Deconstruction is philosopher Jacques Derrida's critique of the relationship between text and meaning.  Derrida's approach consists in conducting readings of texts with an ear to what runs counter to the structural unity or intended sense of a particular text.  The purpose is to expose that the object of language, and that which any text is founded upon, is irreducibly complex, unstable, or impossible.  Throughout his readings, Derrida hoped to show deconstruction at work, i. e. , the ways that this originary complexity—which by definition cannot ever be completely known—works its structuring and destructuring effects. Many debates in continental philosophy surrounding ontology, epistemology, ethics, aesthetics, hermeneutics, and philosophy of language refer to Derrida's observations. 

Direct product<====>8887<====>Direct productIn mathematics, one can often define a direct product of objects already known, giving a new one.  This generalizes the Cartesian product of the underlying sets, together with a suitably defined structure on the product set.  More abstractly, one talks about the product in category theory, which formalizes these notions. Examples are the product of sets (see Cartesian product), groups (described below), the product of rings and of other algebraic structures.  The product of topological spaces is another instance. There is also the direct sum – in some areas this is used interchangeably, in others it is a different concept. 

Déjà vu<====>8888<====>Déjà vu  Déjà vu ( ) is the feeling that the situation currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past.Déjà vu is a feeling of familiarity, and déjà vécu (the feeling of having "already lived through" something) is a feeling of recollection.   Scientific approaches reject the explanation of déjà vu as "precognition" or "prophecy", but rather explain it as an anomaly of memory, which creates a distinct impression that an experience is "being recalled".    This explanation is supported by the fact that the sense of "recollection" at the time is strong in most cases, but the circumstances of the "previous" experience (when, where, and how the earlier experience occurred) are uncertain or believed to be impossible. 

Dionysius Thrax<====>8892<====>Dionysius ThraxDionysius Thrax ( ,  , Contemporary Koine:  ; 170–90 BC) was a Hellenistic grammarian and a pupil of Aristarchus of Samothrace.  His place of origin was not Thrace as the epithet "Thrax" denotes, but probably Alexandria (his father's descent was Thracian).  He lived and worked in this city but later taught at Rhodes. The first extant grammar of Greek, Art of Grammar (  Tékhnē grammatiké) is attributed to him but many scholars today doubt that the work really belongs solely to him due to the difference between the technical approach of most of the work and the more literary approach (similar to the 2nd century's Alexandrian tradition) of the first few sections.

Discrimination<====>8900<====>Discrimination   In human social affairs, discrimination is treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction in favor of or against, a person based on the group, class, or category to which the person is perceived to belong rather than on individual attributes.  This includes treatment of an individual or group, based on their actual or perceived membership in a certain group or social category, "in a way that is worse than the way people are usually treated".   It involves the group's initial reaction or interaction going on to influence the individual's actual behavior towards the group leader or the group, restricting members of one group from opportunities or privileges that are available to another group, leading to the exclusion of the individual or entities based on logical or irrational decision making. 

Double-ended queue<====>8904<====>Double-ended queue  In computer science, a  double-ended queue (dequeue, often abbreviated to deque) is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue, for which elements can be added to or removed from either the front (head) or back (tail).   It is also often called a head-tail linked list, though properly this refers to a specific data structure implementation of a deque (see below). Naming conventionsDeque is sometimes written dequeue, but this use is generally deprecated in technical literature or technical writing because dequeue is also a verb meaning "to remove from a queue".   Nevertheless, several libraries and some writers, such as Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman in their textbook Data Structures and Algorithms, spell it dequeue. 

Diene<====>8905<====>Diene In organic chemistry a diene (   ) or diolefin (   ) is a hydrocarbon that contains two carbon double bonds.   Dienes occur occasionally in nature.   Conjugated dienes are widely used as monomers in the polymer industry. ClassesDienes can be divided into three classes, depending on the relative location of the double bonds: Cumulated dienes have the double bonds sharing a common atom as in a group of compounds called allenes. Conjugated dienes have conjugated double bonds separated by one single bond. Unconjugated dienes have the double bonds separated by two or more single bonds. 

Diatessaron<====>8906<====>Diatessaron The Diatessaron; ( ),  (c.  160–175) is the most prominent early Gospel harmony, and was created by Tatian, an early Christian Assyrian apologist and ascetic.   Tatian sought to combine all the textual material he found in the four gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—into a single coherent narrative of Jesus's life and death.   However, and in contradistinction to most later gospel harmonists, Tatian appears not to have been motivated by any aspiration to validate the four separate canonical gospel accounts; or to demonstrate that, as they stood, they could each be shown as being without inconsistency or error.

DDR SDRAM<====>8922<====>DDR SDRAM  Double data rate synchronous dynamic random-access memory (DDR SDRAM) is a class of memory integrated circuits used in computers.  DDR SDRAM, also called DDR1 SDRAM, has been superseded by DDR2 SDRAM, DDR3 SDRAM and DDR4 SDRAM.  None of its successors are forward or backward compatible with DDR1 SDRAM, meaning DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4 memory modules will not work in DDR1-equipped motherboards, and vice versa. Compared to single data rate (SDR) SDRAM, the DDR SDRAM interface makes higher transfer rates possible by more strict control of the timing of the electrical data and clock signals.  Implementations often have to use schemes such as phase-locked loops and self-calibration to reach the required timing accuracy.

Decca Navigator System<====>8949<====>Decca Navigator System The Decca Navigator System was a hyperbolic radio navigation system which allowed ships and aircraft to determine their position by receiving radio signals from fixed navigational beacons.  The system used phase comparison of low frequencies from 70 to 129 kHz, as opposed to pulse timing systems like Gee and LORAN.  This made it much easier to implement the receivers using 1940s electronics. The system was invented in the US, but development was carried out by Decca in the UK.  It was first deployed by the Royal Navy during World War II when the Allied forces needed a system which could be used to achieve accurate landings and was not known to the Germans and thus free of jamming.

DNA replication<====>9015<====>DNA replicationIn molecular biology, DNA replication is the biological process of producing two identical replicas of DNA from one original DNA molecule.  This process occurs in all living organisms and is the basis for biological inheritance.  The cell possesses the distinctive property of division, which makes replication of DNA essential. DNA is made up of a double helix of two complementary strands.  During replication, these strands are separated.   Each strand of the original DNA molecule then serves as a template for the production of its counterpart, a process referred to as semiconservative replication.  Cellular proofreading and error-checking mechanisms ensure near perfect fidelity for DNA replication.

Discounted cash flow<====>9023<====>Discounted cash flow  In finance, discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis is a method of valuing a project, company, or asset using the concepts of the time value of money.  All future cash flows are estimated and discounted by using cost of capital to give their present values (PVs).  The sum of all future cash flows, both incoming and outgoing, is the net present value (NPV), which is taken as the value of the cash flows in question.  Using DCF analysis to compute the NPV takes as input cash flows and a discount rate and gives as output a present value; the opposite process—takes cash flows and a price (present value) as inputs, and provides as output the discount rate—this is used in bond markets to obtain the yield.

Dementia praecox<====>9059<====>Dementia praecoxDementia praecox (a "premature dementia" or "precocious madness") is a disused psychiatric diagnosis that originally designated a chronic, deteriorating psychotic disorder characterized by rapid cognitive disintegration, usually beginning in the late teens or early adulthood.  Over the years, the term "dementia praecox" was gradually replaced by "schizophrenia", which remains in current diagnostic use. The term "dementia praecox" was first used in 1891 by Arnold Pick (1851–1924), a professor of psychiatry at Charles University in Prague.   His brief clinical report described the case of a person with a psychotic disorder resembling hebephrenia.  German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (1856–1926) popularised it in his first detailed textbook descriptions of a condition that eventually became a different disease concept and relabeled as schizophrenia. 

Dolphin<====>9061<====>Dolphin    Dolphins are a widely distributed and diverse group of aquatic mammals.  They are an informal grouping within the order Cetacea, excluding whales and porpoises, so to zoologists the grouping is paraphyletic.  The dolphins comprise the extant families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the new world river dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin).  There are 40 extant species of dolphins.  Dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates.  Cetaceans' closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. 

Division ring<====>9067<====>Division ringIn abstract algebra, a division ring, also called a skew field, is a ring in which division is possible.

The mission was extended twice to include an encounter with comet 19P/Borrelly and further engineering testing.  Problems during its initial stages and with its star tracker led to repeated changes in mission configuration.  While the flyby of the asteroid was only a partial success, the encounter with the comet retrieved valuable information. 

Jacques-Louis David<====>9072<====>Jacques-Louis David  Jacques-Louis David ( ;  ; 30 August 1748 – 29 December 1825) was a French painter in the Neoclassical style, considered to be the preeminent painter of the era.  In the 1780s his cerebral brand of history painting marked a change in taste away from Rococo frivolity toward a classical austerity and severity, heightened feeling  harmonizing with the moral climate of the final years of the Ancien Régime. David later became an active supporter of the French Revolution and friend of Maximilien Robespierre (1758–1794), and was effectively a dictator of the arts under the French Republic.

Diophantine equation<====>9109<====>Diophantine equation In mathematics, a Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation, usually in two or more unknowns, such that only the integer solutions are sought or studied (an integer solution is a solution such that all the unknowns take integer values).  A linear Diophantine equation is an equation that sums two monomials of degree zero or one.   An exponential Diophantine equation is one in which exponents on terms can be unknowns. Diophantine problems have fewer equations than unknown variables and involve finding integers that work correctly for all equations.  In more technical language, they define an algebraic curve, algebraic surface, or more general object, and ask about the lattice points on it. 

Diophantus<====>9110<====>Diophantus  Diophantus of Alexandria ( ; born probably sometime between AD 201 and 215; died around 84 years old, probably sometime between AD 285 and 299) was an Alexandrian Hellenistic mathematician, who was the author of a series of books called Arithmetica, many of which are now lost.  Sometimes called "the father of algebra", his texts deal with solving algebraic equations.  While reading  Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac's edition of Diophantus' Arithmetica, Pierre de Fermat concluded that a certain equation considered by Diophantus had no solutions, and noted in the margin without elaboration that he had found  "a truly marvelous proof of this proposition," now referred to as Fermat's Last Theorem.

The Daleks were conceived by science-fiction writer Terry Nation and first appeared in the 1963 Doctor Who serial The Daleks, in the shells designed by Raymond Cusick. Drawing inspirations from the real-life example of the Nazis, the Daleks are merciless and pitiless cyborg aliens, demanding total conformity,  bent on conquest of the universe and the extermination of what they see as inferior races.  Their catchphrase, "Exterminate!", is a well-recognised reference in British popular culture. 

Davy Jones (musician)<====>9141<====>Davy Jones (musician)    David Thomas Jones (30 December 1945 – 29 February 2012) was an English singer-songwriter, musician, actor and businessman best known as a member of the band the Monkees, and for starring in the TV series of the same name.  His acting credits include a Tony-nominated role as the Artful Dodger in the original London and Broadway productions of Oliver! as well as a starring cameo role in a hallmark episode of The Brady Bunch television show and later reprised parody film; Love, American Style; and My Two Dads.  Jones is considered one of the great teen idols. 

Dolly (sheep)<====>9146<====>Dolly (sheep)  Dolly (5 July 1996 – 14 February 2003) was a female domestic sheep, and the first mammal cloned from an adult somatic cell, using the process of nuclear transfer. GenesisDolly was cloned by Keith Campbell, Ian Wilmut and colleagues at the Roslin Institute, part of the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, and the biotechnology company PPL Therapeutics, based near Edinburgh.  The funding for Dolly's cloning was provided by PPL Therapeutics and the UK's Ministry of Agriculture.She was born on 5 July 1996 and died from a progressive lung disease five months before her seventh birthday. 

Dolores Fuller<====>9156<====>Dolores Fuller   Dolores Agnes Fuller (née Eble; March 10, 1923 – May 9, 2011 ) was an American actress and songwriter best known as the one-time girlfriend of the low-budget film director Ed Wood.  She played the protagonist's girlfriend in Glen or Glenda, co-starred in Wood's Jail Bait, and had a minor role in his Bride of the Monster.  Later, Elvis Presley recorded a number of her songs written for his films. Film careerHer first screen appearance was at the age of 10, when she appeared briefly in Frank Capra’s It Happened One Night.  According to Fuller,  the female lead in Bride of the Monster was written for her but Wood gave it to Loretta King instead. 

De jure<====>9160<====>De jure   In law and government, de jure (  or  ;    ) describes practices that are legally recognised, whether or not the practices exist in reality.In contrast,   ("in fact" or "in practice") describes situations that exist in reality, even if not legally recognised.The terms are often used to contrast different scenarios: for a colloquial example, "I know that, de jure, this is supposed to be a parking lot, but now that the flood has left four feet of water here, it’s a de facto swimming pool". 

Des Moines, Iowa<====>9163<====>Des Moines, Iowa   Des Moines   is the capital and the most populous city in the U. S.  state of Iowa.  It is also the county seat of Polk County.  A small part of the city extends into Warren County.   It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to "Des Moines" in 1857.   It is on and named after the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the French colonial name, Rivière des Moines, meaning "River of the Monks".  The city's population was 203,433 as of the 2010 census. 

Donald Campbell<====>9164<====>Donald Campbell    Donald Malcolm Campbell,   (23 March 1921 4 January 1967) was a British speed record breaker who broke eight absolute world speed records on water and on land in the 1950s and 1960s.  He remains the only person to set both world land and water speed records in the same year (1964).  He died during a speed attempt at the Lake District in northern England. Family and personal lifeDonald Campbell was born at Canbury House, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey,the son of Malcolm, later Sir Malcolm Campbell, holder of 13 world speed records in the 1920s and 30s in the Bluebird cars and boats, and his second wife, Dorothy Evelyn   Whittall. 

Directed set<====>9165<====>Directed setIn mathematics, a directed set (or a directed preorder or a filtered set) is a nonempty set A together with a reflexive and transitive binary relation ≤ (that is, a preorder), with the additional property that every pair of elements has an upper bound.   In other words, for any a and b in A there must exist c in A with a ≤ c and b ≤ c. The notion defined above is sometimes called an upward directed set.  A downward directed set is defined analogously,  meaning when every pair of elements is bounded below. 

Edward Bellamy<====>9209<====>Edward Bellamy   Edward Bellamy (March 26, 1850 – May 22, 1898) was an American author and socialist, most famous for his utopian novel, Looking Backward, a tale set in the distant future of the year 2000.  Bellamy's vision of a harmonious future world inspired the formation of at least 165 "Nationalist Clubs" dedicated to the propagation of Bellamy's political ideas and working to make them a practical reality.  BiographyEarly yearsEdward Bellamy was born in Chicopee, Massachusetts.  His father was Rufus King Bellamy (1816–1886), a Baptist minister and a descendant of Joseph Bellamy.

Economics<====>9223<====>Economics Economics (UK English:  ,  ;  US English:  ,   ) is the social science that studies the production, distribution, and  consumption of goods and services.    Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions  of economic agents and how economies work.  Microeconomics analyzes basic elements in the economy, including individual agents and markets, their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions.  Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers.  Macroeconomics analyzes the entire economy (meaning aggregated production, consumption, savings, and investment) and issues affecting it, including unemployment of resources (labour, capital, and land), inflation, economic growth, and the public policies that address these issues (monetary, fiscal, and other policies). 

Electronic paper<====>9225<====>Electronic paper   Electronic paper and e-paper are display devices that mimic the appearance of ordinary ink on paper.   Unlike conventional backlit flat panel displays that emit light, electronic paper displays reflect light like paper.  This may make them more comfortable to read, and provide a wider viewing angle than most light-emitting displays.  The contrast ratio in electronic displays available as of 2008 approaches newspaper, and newly (2008) developed displays are slightly better.   An ideal e-paper display can be read in direct sunlight without the image appearing to fade. Many electronic paper technologies hold static text and images indefinitely without electricity. 

Earth<====>9228<====>Earth{{Infobox planet }}Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life.  According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago.  Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite.  Earth revolves around the Sun in 365. 26 days, a period known as an Earth year.  During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366. 26 times.  Earth's axis of rotation is tilted, producing seasonal variations on the planet's surface. 

English Channel<====>9230<====>English ChannelThe English Channel ( , "The Sleeve";  , "Sleeve Channel";  , "Sea of Brittany";  , "British Sea"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and links the southern part of the North Sea to the Atlantic Ocean.   It is the busiest shipping area in the world. It is about   long and varies in width from   at its widest to   in the Strait of Dover.  "English Channel".  The Columbia Encyclopedia, 2004.

Eiffel Tower<====>9232<====>Eiffel Tower The Eiffel Tower (   ;    )  is a wrought iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France.  It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. Constructed from 1887–89 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world; 6. 

Ethical egoism<====>9235<====>Ethical egoism  Ethical egoism  is the normative ethical position that moral agents ought to do what is in their own self-interest.  It differs from psychological egoism, which claims that people can only act in their self-interest.  Ethical egoism also differs from rational egoism, which holds that it is rational to act in one's self-interest.  Ethical egoism holds, therefore, that actions whose consequences will benefit the doer can be considered ethical in this sense. Ethical egoism contrasts with ethical altruism, which holds that moral agents have an obligation to help others.  Egoism and altruism both contrast with ethical utilitarianism, which holds that a moral agent should treat one's self (also known as the subject) with no higher regard than one has for others (as egoism does, by elevating self-interests and "the self" to a status not granted to others). 

Evolution<====>9236<====>Evolution Evolution is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations.    Evolutionary processes give rise to biodiversity at every level of biological organisation, including the levels of species, individual organisms, and molecules.  Repeated formation of new species (speciation), change within species (anagenesis), and loss of species (extinction) throughout the evolutionary history of life on Earth are demonstrated by shared sets of morphological and biochemical traits, including shared DNA sequences.These shared traits are more similar among species that share a more recent common ancestor, and can be used to reconstruct a biological "tree of life" based on evolutionary relationships (phylogenetics), using both existing species and fossils. 

Ernst Mayr<====>9238<====>Ernst MayrNot to be confused with Ernst Mayr (computer scientist), Ernst Mayer, Ernst Meyer, Ernest Mayer or Ernest May.  Ernst Walter Mayr ( ; 5 July 1904 – 3 February 2005)was one of the 20th century's leading evolutionary biologists.  He was also a renowned taxonomist, tropical explorer, ornithologist, philosopher of biology, and historian of science.   His work contributed to the conceptual revolution that led to the modern evolutionary synthesis of Mendelian genetics, systematics, and Darwinian evolution, and to the development of the biological species concept. Although Charles Darwin and others posited that multiple species could evolve from a single common ancestor, the mechanism by which this occurred was not understood, creating the species problem. 

Europe<====>9239<====>EuropeEurope is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere.  It is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.  It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia.  Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.

Euglenozoa<====>9241<====>Euglenozoa The euglenozoa are a large group of flagellate excavates.  They include a variety of common free-living species, as well as a few important parasites, some of which infect humans.  There are two main subgroups, the euglenids and kinetoplastids.  Euglenozoa are unicellular, mostly around 15-40 µm in size, although some euglenids get up to 500 µm long.  StructureMost euglenozoa have two flagella, which are inserted parallel to one another in an apical or subapical pocket.  In some these are associated with a cytostome or mouth, used to ingest bacteria or other small organisms.  This is supported by one of three sets of microtubules that arise from the flagellar bases; the other two support the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the cell. 

Epistemology<====>9247<====>Epistemology   Epistemology ( ;  ) is the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge.  Epistemology studies the nature of knowledge, justification, and the rationality of belief.  Much of the debate in epistemology centers on four areas: (1) the philosophical analysis of the nature of knowledge and how it relates to such concepts as truth, belief, and justification,(2) various problems of skepticism, (3) the sources and scope of knowledge and justified belief, and (4) the criteria for knowledge and justification.  Epistemology addresses such questions as "What makes justified beliefs justified?",  "What does it mean to say that we know something?"  and fundamentally "How do we know that we know?" The term 'Epistemology' was first used by Scottish philosopher James Frederick Ferrier in 1854. 

Esperanto<====>9248<====>Esperanto   Esperanto (  or  ;   ) is a constructed international auxiliary language.  With an estimated two million speakers worldwide,  it is the most widely spoken constructed language in the world.   The Polish-Jewish ophthalmologist L.  L.  Zamenhof published the first book detailing Esperanto,  , in Warsaw on  .  The name of Esperanto derives from   (  translates as "one who hopes"), the pseudonym under which Zamenhof published Unua Libro.   OverviewZamenhof had three goals, as he wrote in Unua Libro:"To render the study of the language so easy as to make its acquisition mere play to the learner. 

Engineering<====>9251<====>Engineering  Engineering is the application of mathematics, science, economics, empirical evidence, social knowledge, and practical knowledge to invent, innovate, design, build, maintain, research, and improve structures, machines, tools, systems, components, materials, processes, solutions, and organizations.   See glossary of engineering. The discipline of engineering encompasses a range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics, applied science, and types of application. The term engineering is derived from the Latin ingenium, meaning "cleverness" and  ingeniare, meaning "to contrive, devise".  DefinitionThe American Engineers' Council for Professional Development (ECPD, the predecessor of ABET) ABET History  has defined "engineering" as: The creative application of scientific principles to design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works utilizing them singly or in combination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their behavior under specific operating conditions; all as respects an intended function, economics of operation and safety to life and property. 

Education<====>9252<====>Education    Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits.  Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research.  Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves.    Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational.  The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship. 

Encyclopedia<====>9253<====>Encyclopedia    An encyclopedia or encyclopaedia is a reference work or compendium providing summaries of information from either all branches of knowledge or from a particular field or discipline.  Encyclopedias are divided into articles or entries that are often arranged alphabetically by article name    and sometimes by thematic categories.  Encyclopedia entries are longer and more detailed than those in most dictionaries.   Generally speaking, unlike dictionary entries which focus on linguistic information about words, such as their meaning, pronunciation, use, and grammatical forms, encyclopedia articles focus on factual information concerning the subject named in the article’s title. 

Enigma machine<====>9256<====>Enigma machine  The Enigma machines were a series of electro-mechanical rotor cipher machines developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic and military communication.  Enigma was invented by the German engineer Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War I.Early models were used commercially from the early 1920s, and adopted by military and government services of several countries, most notably Nazi Germany before and during World War II.   Several different Enigma models were produced, but the German military models, having a plugboard, were the most complex. 

Enzyme<====>9257<====>Enzyme    Enzymes   are macromolecular biological catalysts.  Enzymes accelerate chemical reactions.  The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called substrates and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules known as products.  Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzyme catalysis in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life.  Metabolic pathways depend upon enzymes to catalyze individual steps.  The study of enzymes is called enzymology and a new field of pseudoenzyme analysis has recently grown up, recognising that during evolution, some enzymes have lost the ability to carry out biological catalysis, which is often reflected in their amino acid sequences and unusual 'pseudocatalytic' properties. 

Ethics<====>9258<====>Ethics   Ethics or moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct.  Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy "Ethics"  The term ethics derives  ,  .  The branch of philosophy axiology comprises the sub-branches of ethics and aesthetics, each concerned with values.  Ethics seeks to resolve questions of human morality by defining concepts such as good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice, justice and crime.  As a field of intellectual enquiry, moral philosophy also is related to the fields of moral psychology, descriptive ethics, and value theory. 

Equivalence relation<====>9259<====>Equivalence relation  In mathematics, an equivalence relation is a binary relation that is at the same time a reflexive relation, a symmetric relation and a transitive relation.  As a consequence of these properties an equivalence relation provides a partition of a set into equivalence classes. NotationAlthough various notations are used throughout the literature to denote that two elements a and b of a set are equivalent with respect to an equivalence relation R, the most common are "a ~ b" and "a ≡ b", which are used when R is the obvious relation being referenced, and variations of "a ~ R  b", "a ≡ R  b", or "aRb" otherwise. 

Equivalence class<====>9260<====>Equivalence class In mathematics, when the elements of some set S have a notion of equivalence (formalized as an equivalence relation) defined on them, then one may naturally split the set S into equivalence classes.  These equivalence classes are constructed so that elements a and b belong to the same equivalence class if and only if a and b are equivalent. Formally, given a set   and an equivalence relation   on  , the equivalence class of an element   in   is the set \{ x \in S \mid x \sim a \} of elements which are equivalent to  . 

Entertainment<====>9262<====>Entertainment   Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight.  It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention.   Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar.  Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. 

Ether<====>9263<====>Ether Ethers ( ) are a class of organic compounds that contain an ether group—an oxygen atom connected to two alkyl or aryl groups.   They have the general formula R–O–R′, where R and R′ represent the alkyl or aryl groups.  Ethers can again be classified into two varieties: if the alkyl groups are the same on both sides of the oxygen atom, then it is a simple or symmetrical ether, whereas if they are different, the ethers are called mixed or unsymmetrical ethers.   A typical example of the first group is the solvent and anesthetic diethyl ether, commonly referred to simply as "ether" ( ). 

Ecliptic<====>9264<====>Ecliptic  The ecliptic is the circular path on the celestial sphere that the Sun appears to follow over the course of a year; it is the basis of the ecliptic coordinate system.  The term also refers to the plane of this path, which is coplanar with Earth's orbit around the Sun (and hence the Sun's apparent orbit around Earth).    The ecliptic is not normally noticeable from Earth's surface because Earth rotates, carrying the observer through the cycles of sunrise and sunset, which obscure the Sun's apparent motion against the background of fixed stars. Sun's apparent motionThe motions as described above are simplifications. 

List of former sovereign states<====>9269<====>List of former sovereign states A historical state or historical sovereign state is a state that once existed, but has since been dissolved due to conflict, war, rebellion, annexation, or uprising. This page lists sovereign states, countries, nations, empires or territories that have ceased to exist as political entities, grouped geographically and by constitutional nature.   Criteria for inclusionThe criteria for inclusion in this list is similar to that of the List of states with limited recognition.  To be included here, a polity must have claimed statehood and either:had de facto control over a territory, a population, a government, a capacity to enter into relations with other states, orhave been recognised as a state by at least one other state. 

Ellipse<====>9277<====>Ellipse  In mathematics, an ellipse is a curve in a plane surrounding two focal points such that the sum of the distances to the two focal points is constant for every point on the curve.  As such, it is a generalization of a circle, which is a special type of an ellipse having both focal points at the same location.  The shape of an ellipse (how "elongated" it is) is represented by its eccentricity, which for an ellipse can be any number from 0 (the limiting case of a circle) to arbitrarily close to but less than 1. 

Elephant<====>9279<====>Elephant Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea.  Three species are currently recognized: the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L.  cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus).  Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.  Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. 

Evolutionary linguistics<====>9281<====>Evolutionary linguistics  Evolutionary linguistics is a subfield of psycholinguistics that studies the psychosocial and cultural factors involved in the origin of language and the development of linguistic universals.The main challenge in this research is the lack of empirical data: spoken language leaves practically no traces.  This led to the abandonment of the field for more than a century, despite the common origins of language hinted at by the relationships among individual languages established by the field of historical linguistics.  Since the late 1980s, the field has been revived in the wake of progress  made in the related fields of Biolinguistics, psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, evolutionary anthropology, evolutionary psychology, universal grammar, and cognitive science. 

ECHELON<====>9282<====>ECHELON   ECHELON, originally a secret government code name, is a surveillance program (signals intelligence/SIGINT collection and analysis network) operated by the US with the aid of four other signatory nations to the UKUSA Security Agreement Given the 5 dialects that use the terms, UKUSA can be pronounced from "You-Q-SA" to "Oo-Coo-SA", AUSCANNZUKUS can be pronounced from "Oz-Can-Zuke-Us" to "Orse-Can-Zoo-Cuss". From Talk:UKUSA Agreement: "Per documents officially released by both the Government Communications Headquarters and the National Security Agency, this agreement is referred to as the UKUSA Agreement.  This name is subsequently used by media sources reporting on the story, as written in new references used for the article. 

Equation<====>9284<====>Equation In mathematics, an equation is a statement of an equality containing one or more variables.  Solving the equation consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true.  Variables are also called unknowns and the values of the unknowns which satisfy the equality are called solutions of the equation.  There are two kinds of equations: identities and conditional equations.  An identity is true for all values of the variable.  A conditional equation is true for only particular values of the variables.   Each side of an equation will contain one or more terms. 

Ethical naturalism<====>9285<====>Ethical naturalismEthical naturalism (also called moral naturalism or naturalistic cognitivistic definism)  is the meta-ethical view which claims that:Reductive naturalismEthical sentences express propositions. Some such propositions are true. Those propositions are made true by objective features of the world, independent of human opinion. These moral features of the world are reducible to some set of non-moral featuresorNon-reductive naturalismEthical sentences express propositions. Some such propositions are true. Those propositions are made true by objective features of the world, independent of human opinion. These moral features of the world are not reducible to some set of non-moral features, but are supervened by some set of non-moral featuresThis makes ethical naturalism a definist form of moral realism, which is in turn a form of cognitivism. 

Ethical non-naturalism<====>9286<====>Ethical non-naturalism Ethical non-naturalism is the meta-ethical view which claims that:Ethical sentences express propositions. Some such propositions are true. Those propositions are made true by objective features of the world, independent of human opinion. These moral features of the world are not reducible to any set of non-moral features. This makes ethical non-naturalism a non-definist form of moral realism, which is in turn a form of cognitivism.  Ethical non-naturalism stands in opposition to ethical naturalism, which claims that moral terms and properties are reducible to non-moral terms and properties, as well as to all forms of moral anti-realism, including ethical subjectivism (which denies that moral propositions refer to objective facts), error theory (which denies that any moral propositions are true), and non-cognitivism (which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all). 

Elvis Presley<====>9288<====>Elvis PresleyElvis Aaron Presley  (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer, musician, and actor.  Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the "King of Rock and Roll" or simply "the King". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old.  His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African American music to a wider audience. 

The Evil Dead<====>9294<====>The Evil DeadThe Evil Dead is a 1981 American supernatural horror film written and directed by Sam Raimi and executive produced by Raimi and Bruce Campbell, who also stars alongside Ellen Sandweiss and Betsy Baker.  The film focuses on five college students vacationing in an isolated cabin in a remote wooded area.  After they find an audiotape that releases a legion of demons and spirits, members of the group suffer from demonic possession, leading to increasingly gory mayhem.  Raimi and the cast produced the short film Within the Woods as a "prototype" to build the interest of potential investors, which secured Raimi US$90,000 to produce The Evil Dead. 

Economic calculation problem<====>9297<====>Economic calculation problem The economic calculation problem is a criticism of using economic planning as a substitute for market-based allocation of the factors of production.  It was first proposed by Ludwig von Mises in his 1920 article "Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth" and later expanded upon by Friedrich Hayek. In his first article, Mises describes the nature of the price system under capitalism and describes how individual subjective values are translated into the objective information necessary for rational allocation of resources in society.  In market exchanges, prices reflect the supply and demand of resources, labor, and products. 

Erasmus Darwin<====>9299<====>Erasmus Darwin    Erasmus Darwin (12 December 1731 18 April 1802) was an English physician.  One of the key thinkers of the Midlands Enlightenment, he was also a natural philosopher, physiologist, slave-trade abolitionist,    inventor and poet. His poems included much natural history, including a statement of evolution and the relatedness of all forms of life. He was a member of the Darwin–Wedgwood family, which includes his grandsons Charles Darwin and Francis Galton.  Darwin was a founding member of the Lunar Society of Birmingham, a discussion group of pioneering industrialists and natural philosophers. He turned down an invitation of George III's to become a physician to the King. 

Ediacaran<====>9300<====>Ediacaran  The Ediacaran Period ( ), spans 94 million years from the end of the Cryogenian Period 635 million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Cambrian Period 541 Mya.  It marks the end of the  Proterozoic Eon, and the beginning of the Phanerozoic Eon.  It is named after the Ediacara Hills of South Australia. The Ediacaran Period's status as an official geological period was ratified in 2004 by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), making it the first new geological period declared in 120 years.   Although the Period takes its name from the Ediacara Hills where geologist Reg Sprigg first discovered fossils of the eponymous Ediacara biota in 1946, the type section is located in the bed of the Enorama Creek  within Brachina Gorge  in the Flinders Ranges of South Australia, at   . 

Erotica<====>9301<====>Erotica Erotica is any artistic work that deals substantively with erotically stimulating or sexually arousing subject matter.   All forms of art may depict erotic content, including painting, sculpture, photography, drama, film, music or literature.  Erotica has high-art aspirations, differentiating it from commercial pornography.  Curiosa is erotica and pornography as discrete,  collectible items, usually in published or printed form. Erotica and pornographyDistinction is often made between erotica and pornography (as well as the lesser known genre of sexual entertainment, ribaldry), although some viewers may not distinguish between them.  A key distinction, some have argued, is that pornography's objective is the graphic depiction of sexually explicit scenes, while erotica "seeks to tell a story that involves sexual themes" that include a more plausible depiction of human sexuality than in pornography. 

Existence<====>9302<====>Existence    Existence, in its most generic terms, comprises the state of being real  and the ability to physically interact with the universe or multiverse.  What existence is exactly is up for interpretation; and, is one of the most important and fundamental topics of ontology, the philosophical study of the nature of being, existence, or reality in general, as well as of the basic categories of being and their relations.  Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics, ontology deals with questions concerning what entities exist or can be said to exist, (for instance: "Does the stellar structure UDFj-39546284 exist?"), and how such entities can be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to similarities and differences. 

Demand-pull inflation<====>9307<====>Demand-pull inflationDemand-pull inflation is asserted to arise when aggregate demand in an economy outpaces aggregate supply.  It involves inflation rising as real gross domestic product rises and unemployment falls, as the economy moves along the Phillips curve.  This is commonly described as "too much money chasing too few goods".   More accurately, it should be described as involving "too much money spent chasing too few goods", since only money that is spent on goods and services can cause inflation.  This would not be expected to happen, unless the economy is already at a full employment level. 

Cost-push inflation<====>9308<====>Cost-push inflation Cost-push inflation is a type of inflation caused by substantial increases in the cost of important goods or services where no suitable alternative is available.  A situation that has been often cited of this was the oil crisis of the 1970s, which some economists see as a major cause of the inflation experienced in the Western world in that decade.  It is argued that this inflation resulted from increases in the cost of petroleum imposed by the member states of OPEC.  Since petroleum is so important to industrialized economies, a large increase in its price can lead to the increase in the price of most products, raising the price level. 

Extractor (mathematics)<====>9309<====>Extractor (mathematics)An  (N,M,D,K,\epsilon)  -extractor is a bipartite graph with  N  nodes on the left and  M  nodes on the right such that each node on the left has  D  neighbors (on the right), which has the added property thatfor any subset  A  of the left vertices of size at least  K , the distribution on right vertices obtained by choosing a random node in  A  and then following a random edge to get a node x on the right side is  \epsilon -close to the uniform distribution in terms of total variation distance.A disperser is a related graph. An equivalent way to view an extractor is as a bivariate function  E : [N] \times [D] \rightarrow [M]  in the natural way. With this view it turns out that the extractor property is equivalent to: for any source of randomness  X  that gives  n  bits with min-entropy  \log K , the distribution   E(X,U_D)   is  \epsilon -close to  U_M , where  U_T  denotes the uniform distribution on  [T] .Extractors are interesting when they can be constructed with small  K,D,\epsilon  relative to  N  and  M  is as close to  KD  (the total randomness in the input sources) as possible.Extractor functions were originally researched as a way to extract randomness from weakly random sources. See randomness extractor.Using the probabilistic method it is easy to show that extractor graphs with really good parameters exist. The challenge is to find explicit or polynomial time computable examples of such graphs with good parameters. Algorithms that compute extractor (and disperser) graphs have found many applications in computer science.ReferencesRonen Shaltiel, Recent developments in extractors - a survey

Enterprise resource planning<====>9310<====>Enterprise resource planning   Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is the integrated management of core business processes, often in real-time and mediated by software and technology.  ERP is usually referred to as a category of business-management software — typically a suite of integrated applications—that an organization can use to collect, store, manage and interpret data from these many business activities. ERP provides an integrated and continuously updated  view of core business processes using common databases maintained by a database management system.  ERP systems track business resources—cash, raw materials, production capacity—and the status of business commitments: orders, purchase orders, and payroll. 

Endocrinology<====>9311<====>Endocrinology  Endocrinology (from Greek  , endon, "within";  , krīnō, "to separate"; and  ,  ) is a branch of biology and medicine dealing with the endocrine system, its diseases, and its specific secretions known as hormones.  It is also concerned with the integration of developmental events proliferation, growth, and differentiation, and the psychological or behavioral activities of metabolism, growth and development, tissue function, sleep, digestion, respiration, excretion, mood, stress, lactation, movement, reproduction, and sensory perception caused by hormones.  Specializations include behavioral endocrinology    and comparative endocrinology. The endocrine system consists of several glands, all in different parts of the body, that secrete hormones directly into the blood rather than into a duct system. 

Endocrine system<====>9312<====>Endocrine system The endocrine system is the collection of glands of an organism that secrete hormones directly into the circulatory system to be carried towards distant target organs.  In humans, the major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands.   In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems.  The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine.    Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. 

Expander graph<====>9313<====>Expander graphIn combinatorics, an expander graph is a sparse graph that has strong connectivity properties, quantified using vertex, edge or spectral expansion as described below.  Expander constructions have spawned research in pure and applied mathematics, with several applications to complexity theory, design of robust computer networks, and the theory of error-correcting codes.  DefinitionsIntuitively, an expander is a finite, undirected multigraph in which every subset of the vertices that  is not "too large" has a "large" boundary.  Different formalisations of these notions give rise to different notions of expanders: edge expanders, vertex expanders, and spectral expanders, as defined below. 

England<====>9316<====>England   England  is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west.  The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest.  England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south.  The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south, and includes over 100 smaller named islands such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight. 

European Union<====>9317<====>European Union  The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of   member states that are located primarily  in Europe.  It has an area of   , and an estimated population of over 510 million.  The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states.  EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade,  agriculture,  fisheries, and regional development. 

Eriocaulales<====>9319<====>Eriocaulales Eriocaulales is a botanical name for an order of flowering plants. The name was published by Nakai. In the Cronquist system the name was used for an order placed in the subclass Commelinidae. The order consisted of one family only (1981):order Eriocaulalesfamily EriocaulaceaeThe APG IV system assigns these plants to the order Poales.  

Ericales<====>9320<====>Ericales  The Ericales are a large and diverse order of dicotyledons, including, for example, tea, persimmon, blueberry, Brazil nut, and azalea.  The order includes trees, bushes, lianas, and herbaceous plants.  Together with ordinary autophytic plants, the Ericales include chlorophyll-deficient mycoheterotrophic plants (e. g. , Sarcodes sanguinea) and carnivorous plants (e. g. , genus Sarracenia). Many species have five petals, often grown together.  Fusion of the petals as a trait was traditionally used to place the order in the subclass Sympetalae.  Mycorrhiza is an interesting property, frequently associated with the Ericales.  Indeed, symbiosis with root fungi is quite common among the order representatives, and three kinds of it can be found exclusively among Ericales (namely, ericoid, arbutoid and monotropoid mycorrhiza). 

Edward Sapir<====>9321<====>Edward Sapir  Edward Sapir ( ; January 26, 1884 – February 4, 1939) was an Prussian-American anthropologist-linguist, who is widely considered to be one of the most important figures in the early development of the discipline of linguistics.   Sapir was born in German Pomerania; his parents emigrated to United States of America when he was a child.  He studied Germanic linguistics at Columbia, where he came under the influence of Franz Boas who inspired him to work on Native American languages.  While finishing his Ph. D.  he went to California to work with Alfred Kroeber documenting the indigenous languages there.

Easter egg<====>9324<====>Easter egg  Easter eggs, also called Paschal eggs,  are decorated eggs that are usually used as gifts on the occasion of Easter or springtime celebration.  As such, Easter eggs are common during the season of Eastertide (Easter season).  The oldest tradition is to use dyed and painted chicken eggs, but a modern custom is to substitute chocolate eggs wrapped in colourful foil, or plastic eggs filled with confectionery such as chocolate.  Although eggs, in general, were a traditional symbol of fertility and rebirth,    in Christianity, for the celebration of Eastertide, Easter eggs symbolize the empty tomb of Jesus, from which Jesus resurrected. 

Easter<====>9325<====>EasterEaster, Traditional names for the feast in English are "Easter Day", as in the Book of Common Prayer, "Easter Sunday", used by James Ussher (The Whole Works of the Most Rev.  James Ussher, Volume 4) and Samuel Pepys (The Diary of Samuel Pepys, Volume 2) and plain "Easter", as in books printed in 1575, 1584, 1586  also called Pascha (Greek, Latin)  or Resurrection Sunday,  is a festival and holiday celebrating the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, described in the New Testament as having occurred on the third day of his burial after his crucifixion by the Romans at Calvary   30 AD. 

Euclid<====>9331<====>Euclid    Euclid ( ;   Eukleidēs  ; fl.  300 BC), sometimes given the name Euclid of Alexandria    to distinguish him from Euclides of Megara, was a Greek mathematician, often referred to as the "founder of geometry"  or the "father of geometry".  He was active in Alexandria during the reign of Ptolemy I (323–283 BC).  His Elements is one of the most influential works in the history of mathematics, serving as the main textbook for teaching mathematics (especially geometry) from the time of its publication until the late 19th or early 20th century. 

Errol Morris<====>9332<====>Errol Morris  Errol Mark Morris (born February 5, 1948) is an American film director primarily of documentaries examining and investigating, among other things, authorities and eccentrics.  He is perhaps best known for his 1988 documentary The Thin Blue Line, commonly cited among the best and most influential documentaries ever made.  In 2003, his documentary film The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S.  McNamara won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.  BiographyEarly lifeMorris was born on February 5, 1948, and raised in a Jewish family in Hewlett, New York.  After being treated for strabismus in childhood, he refused to wear an eye patch. 

Ethan Allen<====>9333<====>Ethan Allen  Ethan Allen (  Allen's date of birth is made confusing by calendrical differences caused by the conversion between the Julian and Gregorian calendars.  The first change offsets the date by 11 days.   The second is that, at the time of Allen's birth, the New Year began on March 25.   As a result, while his birth is officially recorded as happening on January 10, 1737, conversions due to these changes make the date in the modern calendar January 21, 1738.  Adjusting for the movement of the New Year to January changes the year to 1738; adjusting for the Gregorian calendar changes the date from January 10 to 21. 

Ecuador<====>9334<====>Ecuador   Ecuador (   ,  ) ( ), officially the Republic of Ecuador ( ,   which literally translates as "Republic of the Equator";  ), is a representative democratic republic in northwestern South America, bordered by Colombia on the north, Peru on the east and south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west.  Ecuador also includes the Galápagos Islands in the Pacific, about   west of the mainland.  The capital city is Quito, while the largest city is Guayaquil. What is now Ecuador was home to a variety of Amerindian groups that were gradually incorporated into the Inca Empire during the 15th century. 

History of Ecuador<====>9335<====>History of Ecuador The History of Ecuador extends over an 8,000-year period.  During this time a variety of cultures and territories influenced what has become the Republic of Ecuador.  The history can be divided into five eras: Pre-Columbian, the Conquest, the Colonial Period, the War of Independence, Gran Colombia, and Simón Bolívar the final separation of his vision into what is known today as the Republic of Ecuador. Pre-Columbian Ecuador  During the pre-Inca period, people lived in ans, which formed great tribes, some allied with each other to form powerful confederations, as the Confederation of Quito.  But none of these confederations could resist the formidable momentum of the Tawantinsuyu. 

Geography of Ecuador<====>9336<====>Geography of Ecuador  Ecuador is a country in western South America, bordering the Pacific Ocean at the Equator, for which the country is named.  Ecuador encompasses a wide range of natural formations and climates, from the desert-like southern coast to the snowcapped peaks of the Andes mountain range to the plains of the Amazon Basin.  Cotopaxi in Ecuador is one of the world's highest active volcanos.  It also has a large series of rivers that follow the southern border and spill into the northwest area of Peru. Area and borders Ecuador is located on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and has 2,237 km of coastline. 

Ecuadorians<====>9337<====>Ecuadorians  Ecuadorians are the citizens of the Republic of Ecuador, or their descendants abroad who identify with the Ecuadorian culture and descent.  Ecuador is a multiethnic society, a home to people of various ethnic origins; as a result, Ecuadorians do not equate their nationality with their ethnicity, but rather their allegiance or affinity for Ecuador.  Majority of Ecuadorians trace their origins to one or more of three geographical sources of human migrations to the territory of modern Ecuador: the pre-Hispanic indigenous populations who settled the region over 15,000 years ago, the Europeans (principally Spaniards which are also the source of the Spanish language) who arrived over five centuries ago, and ultimately the sub-Saharan Africans who were imported to New Spain as slaves during the same period. 

Politics of Ecuador<====>9338<====>Politics of Ecuador  The politics of Ecuador are multi-party.   The central government polity is a four-yearly elected presidential, unicameral representative democracy.  The President of Ecuador is head of state and head of government on a multi-party system, leading a cabinet with further executive power.  Legislative power is not limited to the National Assembly as it may to a lesser degree be exercised by the executive which consists of the President convening an appointed executive cabinet.   Subsequent acts of the National Assembly are supreme over Executive Orders where sufficient votes have been cast by the legislators. 

Economy of Ecuador<====>9339<====>Economy of EcuadorThe economy of Ecuador is based mostly on exports of oil, bananas, shrimp, gold, other primary agricultural products and money transfers from nearly a million Ecuadorian emigrants employed abroad.  In 2002, oil accounted for about one-third of public-sector revenue and 40% of export earnings.  Ecuador is the world's largest exporter of bananas ($936. 5 million in 2002) and a major exporter of shrimp ($251 million in 2002).  Exports of non-traditional products such as flowers ($291 million in 2002) and canned fish ($333 million in 2002) have grown in recent years.

Ecuador's principal foreign-policy objectives have traditionally included defense of its territory from both external aggression and internal subversion as well as support for the objectives of the UN and the OAS. 

Geography of Egypt<====>9348<====>Geography of Egypt  The geography of Egypt relates to two regions: North Africa and Southwest Asia. Egypt has coastlines on the Mediterranean Sea, the River Nile and the Red Sea.  Egypt borders Libya to the west, the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, and Sudan to the south.  Egypt has an area of 1,001,449 km 2  (386,662 mi 2 ). The longest straight-line distance in Egypt from north to south is 1,024 km (636 mi), while that from east to west measures 1,240 km (771 mi).  More than 2,900 km (1800 mi) of coastline on the Mediterranean Sea, the Gulf of Suez, the Gulf of Aqaba, and the gulf shoreGovernorates Egypt is divided into 27 governorates, which include two city-governorates: Alexandria (Alexandria Governorate) and Cairo (Cairo Governorate). 

Demographics of Egypt<====>9349<====>Demographics of Egypt  Egypt is the most populous country in the Arab World and the third-most populous on the African continent (after Nigeria and Ethiopia).  About 95%   of the country's 93 million people (2017)  live along the banks of the Nile and in the Nile Delta, which fans out north of Cairo; and along the Suez Canal.  These regions are among the world's most densely populated, containing an average of over 3,820 persons per square mile (1,540 per km². ), as compared to 181 persons per sq.  mi.  for the country as a whole. 

Politics of Egypt<====>9350<====>Politics of Egypt  The politics of Egypt is based on republicanism, with a semi-presidential system of government, established following the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, and the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak.  The President is elected for two four-year terms and the Parliament is unicameral.  The President can appoint up to 5% of the total number of seats in Parliament, and can also dissolve it.  Parliament can also impeach the President.  Egypt was traditionally ruled by royals until 1952, but the first free elected President was in 2012.  The Parliament of Egypt is the oldest legislative chamber in Africa and the Middle East. 

Economy of Egypt<====>9351<====>Economy of Egypt The economy of Egypt was a highly centralized planned economy focused on import substitution under President Gamal Abdel Nasser.  In the 1990s, a series of International Monetary Fund arrangements, coupled with massive external debt relief resulting from Egypt's participation in the Gulf War coalition, helped Egypt improve its macroeconomic performance. Since 2000, the pace of structural reforms, including fiscal, monetary policies, taxation, privatization and new business legislations, helped Egypt move towards a more market-oriented economy and prompted increased foreign investment.  The reforms and policies have strengthened macroeconomic annual growth results which averaged 8% annually between 2004 and 2009 but the government largely failed to equitably share the wealth and the benefits of growth have failed to trickle down to improve economic conditions for the broader population, especially with the growing problem of unemployment and underemployment.

Demographics of Estonia<====>9389<====>Demographics of EstoniaThe demographics of Estonia in the twenty-first century result from historical trends over more than a thousand years, as with most European countries, but have been disproportionately influenced by events in the last half of the twentieth century.  The rise and fall of the Soviet Union, including the annexation and eventual independence of Estonia, has had a major effect on Estonia's ethnic makeup and educational achievement. Languages spoken in Estonia largely reflect the ethnic groups composing the country, and thus have changed with historical trends affecting the ethnic makeup of the country.  Religion plays a small part in the lives of most Estonians, largely  as a result of the Soviet occupation from 1944–1991.

The economy of Estonia is strongly influenced by developments in the Finnish and Swedish economies.   OverviewBefore the Second World War, Estonia's economy was based on agriculture, but there was a significant knowledge sector, with the university city of Tartu known for scientific contributions, and a growing industrial sector, similar to that of neighbouring Finland.  Products such as butter, milk and cheese were widely known on the western European markets.  The main markets were Germany and the United Kingdom, and only 3% of all commerce was with the neighbouring USSR. 

Telecommunications in Estonia<====>9392<====>Telecommunications in Estonia The National Telecommunications act in the second period of Estonian independence granted a monopoly on international and local fixed line telephony to Estonian Telecom (Eesti Telecom).   In the process of privatization, a concession was granted to liberalize mobile, CATV and packet-switched telecommunications.   This concession was critical for developing a competitive market.  Three licensed mobile operators encouraged one of the highest rates of mobile telephony penetration in the world.   CATV licenses were granted at a local level, and while it was a more natural monopoly, pirate operators proliferated within populous cities in the 1990s.

The forcible incorporation of Estonia into the Soviet Union in 1940 was not generally recognised by the international community and the Estonian diplomatic service continued to operate in some countries.  Following the restoration of independence from the Soviet Union, Russia was one of the first nations to re-recognize Estonia's independence (the first country to do so was Iceland on 22 August 1991).  Estonia's immediate priority after regaining its independence was the withdrawal of Russian (formerly Soviet) forces from Estonian territory.

Foreign relations of Ethiopia<====>9406<====>Foreign relations of Ethiopia  Many historians trace modern Ethiopia's foreign policy to the reign of Emperor Tewodros II, whose primary concerns were the security of Ethiopia's traditional borders, obtaining technology from Europe (or modernization), and to a lesser degree Ethiopian rights to the monastery of Dar-es-Sultan in the city of Jerusalem.   Tewodros' diplomatic efforts, however, ended disastrously with the British expedition of 1868 which concluded with his death.  Despite the efforts of his successor Emperor Yohannes IV to establish a relationship with the United Kingdom, Ethiopia was ignored by the world powers until the opening of the Suez Canal, and more important, the Mahdist War, drew outside attention to her once more. 

Europa Island<====>9407<====>Europa Island Europa Island ( ) is a   low-lying tropical atoll in the Mozambique Channel, about a third of the way from southern Madagascar to southern Mozambique.  The island had never been inhabited until 1820, when the French family Rosier moved to it.  The island officially became a possession of France in 1897.  The island, garrisoned by a detachment from Réunion, has a weather station and is visited by scientists.   Though uninhabited, it is part of the "Scattered Islands" of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands administrative region.  Europa Island was the setting of a 1968 episode of "The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau",  partly focusing on the breeding habits of the green sea turtle. 

Euclidean geometry<====>9417<====>Euclidean geometry  Euclidean geometry is a mathematical system attributed to the Alexandrian Greek mathematician Euclid, which he described in his textbook on geometry: the Elements.  Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms, and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these.  Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians,  Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and logical system.   The Elements begins with plane geometry, still taught in secondary school as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of formal proof. 

Epic poetry<====>9418<====>Epic poetry    An epic poem, epic, epos, or epopee  is a lengthy narrative poem, ordinarily concerning a serious subject containing details of heroic deeds and events significant to a culture or nation.   Milman Parry and Albert Lord have argued that the Homeric epics, the earliest works of Western literature, were fundamentally an oral poetic form.  These works form the basis of the epic genre in Western literature.  Nearly all of Western epic (including Virgil's Aeneid and Dante's Divine Comedy) self-consciously presents itself as a continuation of the tradition begun by these poems. 

Eocene<====>9419<====>Eocene The Eocene (   ) Epoch, lasting from  , is a major division of the geologic timescale and the second epoch of the Paleogene Period in the Cenozoic Era.  The Eocene spans the time from the end of the Paleocene Epoch to the beginning of the Oligocene Epoch.  The start of the Eocene is marked by a brief period in which the concentration of the carbon isotope  13 C in the atmosphere was exceptionally low in comparison with the more common isotope  12 C.  The end is set at a major extinction event called the Grande Coupure (the "Great Break" in continuity) or the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event, which may be related to the impact of one or more large bolides in Siberia and in what is now Chesapeake Bay.

Ethology<====>9425<====>Ethology Ethology is the scientific and objective study of animal behaviour, usually with a focus on behaviour under natural conditions, and viewing behaviour as an evolutionarily adaptive trait.   Behaviourism is a term that also describes the scientific and objective study of animal behaviour, usually referring to measured responses to stimuli or trained behavioural responses in a laboratory context, without a particular emphasis on evolutionary adaptivity.   Many naturalists have studied aspects of animal behaviour throughout history.  Ethology has its scientific roots in the work of Charles Darwin and of American and German ornithologists of the late 19th and early 20th century, including Charles O. 

Electromagnetic radiation<====>9426<====>Electromagnetic radiation    In physics, electromagnetic radiation (EM radiation or EMR) refers to the waves (or their quanta, photons) of the electromagnetic field, propagating (radiating) through space-time, carrying electromagnetic radiant energy.   It includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, (visible) light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.  "Classically, electromagnetic radiation consists of electromagnetic waves, which are synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields that propagate at the speed of light through a vacuum.   The oscillations of the two fields are perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of energy and wave propagation, forming a transverse wave. 

Ernest Hemingway<====>9428<====>Ernest HemingwayErnest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899 – July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, short story writer, and journalist.  His economical and understated style had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations.  Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954.  He published seven novels, six short story collections, and two non-fiction works.  Additional works, including three novels, four short story collections, and three non-fiction works, were published posthumously. 

Young and Innocent<====>9429<====>Young and Innocent  Young and Innocent (American title: The Girl Was Young) is a 1937 British crime thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Nova Pilbeam and Derrick De Marney.  Based on the 1936 novel A Shilling for Candles by Josephine Tey, the film is about a young man on the run from a murder charge who enlists the help of a woman who must put herself at risk for his cause.  It is notable for an elaborately staged crane shot Hitchcock devised towards the end of the film, which identifies the real murderer. PlotOn a stormy night, at a retreat on the English coast, Christine Clay (Pamela Carme), a successful actress, argues passionately with her jealous ex-husband Guy (George Curzon).

Electrical telegraph<====>9450<====>Electrical telegraph An electrical telegraph is a telegraph that uses electrical signals, usually conveyed via dedicated telecommunication lines or radio. The electrical telegraph, or more commonly just telegraph, superseded optical semaphore telegraph systems, thus becoming the first form of electrical telecommunications.  In a matter of decades after their creation in the 1830s, electrical telegraph networks permitted people and commerce to transmit messages across both continents and oceans almost instantly, with widespread social and economic impacts. History Early work From early studies of electricity, electrical phenomena were known to travel with great speed, and many experimenters worked on the application of electricity to communications at a distance. 

Establishing shot<====>9454<====>Establishing shot An establishing shot in filmmaking and television production sets up, or establishes the context for a scene by showing the relationship between its important figures and objects.It is generally a long or extreme-long shot at the beginning of a scene indicating where, and sometimes when, the remainder of the scene takes place.   Establishing shots were more common during the classical era of filmmaking than they are now.  Today's filmmakers tend to skip the establishing shot in order to move the scene along more quickly. 

Etruscan language<====>9455<====>Etruscan language The Etruscan language ( )  was the spoken and written language of the Etruscan civilization, in Italy, in the ancient region of Etruria (modern Tuscany plus western Umbria and northern Latium) and in parts of Campania, Lombardy, Veneto, and Emilia-Romagna, where the Etruscans were later displaced by Gauls.  Etruscan influenced Latin, but was eventually completely superseded by it.  The Etruscans left around 13,000 inscriptions which have been found so far, only a small minority of which are of significant length, some bilingual inscriptions with texts also in Latin, Greek or Phoenician, and a few dozen loanwords, such as the name Roma (from Etruscan Ruma,  but Etruscan's influence was significant. 

Election<====>9457<====>ElectionAn election is a formal group decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office.  "Election (political science)," Encyclopedia Britanica Online.  Retrieved 18 August 2009  Elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century.   Elections may fill offices in the legislature, sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and local government.  This process is also used in many other private and business organizations, from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations.  The universal use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype, ancient Athens, where the Elections were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using sortition, also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot. 

Enniskillen<====>9459<====>Enniskillen    Enniskillen ( ,    ) is a town and civil parish in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland.  It is located almost exactly in the centre of the county, between the Upper and Lower sections of Lough Erne.  It had a population of 13,823 in the 2011 census.  It was the seat of local government for the former Fermanagh District Council, and is the county town of Fermanagh as well as its largest town. HistoryThe town's name comes from the  .  This refers to Cethlenn, a figure in Irish mythology who may have been a goddess. 

Longest word in English<====>9467<====>Longest word in English  The identity of the longest word in English depends upon the definition of what constitutes a word in the English language, as well as how length should be compared.  In addition to words derived naturally from the language's roots (without any known intentional invention), English allows new words to be formed by coinage and construction; place names may be considered words; technical terms may be arbitrarily long.  Length may be understood in terms of orthography and number of written letters, or (less commonly) phonology and the number of phonemes. Word  Letters  Characteristics  Dispute189,819 Chemical name of titin, the largest known protein Technical; not in dictionary; disputed whether it is a word  Methionylglutaminylarginyltyrosylglutamyl.

Externalization<====>9471<====>Externalization In Freudian psychology, externalization is an unconscious defense mechanism by which an individual "projects" his or her own internal characteristics onto the outside world, particularly onto other people.   For example, a patient who is overly argumentative might instead perceive others as argumentative and himself as blameless. Like other defense mechanisms, externalization is a protection against anxiety and is, therefore, part of a healthy, normally functioning mind.  However, if taken to excess, it can lead to the development of a neurosis. Externalization can also be used in the context of a corporation.  A corporation that externalizes its costs onto society and the environment is not taking full responsibility and ownership of these costs. 

Euro<====>9472<====>Euro    The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the European Union.  Currently 19 of   member states use the euro (eurozone).  It is the second most traded currency in the foreign exchange market after the United States dollar.   The euro is subdivided into 100 cents (defined as eurocent). The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans  .   Outside Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency. 

European Central Bank<====>9474<====>European Central BankThe European Central Bank (ECB; German: Europäische Zentralbank (EZB), French: Banque centrale européenne (BCE)) is the central bank for the euro and administers monetary policy of the eurozone, which consists of 19 EU member states and is one of the largest currency areas in the world.  It is one of the world's most important central banks and is one of the seven institutions of the European Union (EU) listed in the Treaty on European Union (TEU).  The capital stock of the bank is owned by the central banks of all 28 EU member states. 

Electron<====>9476<====>Electron    of the ray components.  However, this produced a value that was more than a thousand times greater than what was expected, so little credence was given to his calculations at the time.   In 1892 Hendrik Lorentz suggested that the mass of these particles (electrons) could be a consequence of their electric charge.  In 1896, the British physicist J.  J.  Thomson, with his colleagues John S.  Townsend and H.  A.  Wilson,  performed experiments indicating that cathode rays really were unique particles, rather than waves, atoms or molecules as was believed earlier. 

Europium<====>9477<====>Europium  Europium is a chemical element with symbol Eu and atomic number 63.  It was isolated in 1901 and is named after the continent of Europe.   It is a moderately hard, silvery metal which readily oxidizes in air and water.  Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, europium usually assumes the oxidation state +3, but the oxidation state +2 is also common.  All europium compounds with oxidation state +2 are slightly reducing.  Europium has no significant biological role and is relatively non-toxic compared to other heavy metals.  Most applications of europium exploit the phosphorescence of europium compounds. 

Erbium<====>9478<====>Erbium Erbium is a chemical element with symbol Er and atomic number 68.  A silvery-white solid metal when artificially isolated, natural erbium is always found in chemical combination with other elements.  It is a lanthanide, a rare earth element, originally found in the gadolinite mine in Ytterby in Sweden, from which it got its name. Erbium's principal uses involve its pink-colored Er 3+  ions, which have optical fluorescent properties particularly useful in certain laser applications.  Erbium-doped glasses or crystals can be used as optical amplification media, where Er 3+  ions are optically pumped at around 980 or   and then radiate light at   in stimulated emission. 

Einsteinium<====>9479<====>Einsteinium  Einsteinium is a synthetic element with symbol Es and atomic number 99.  It is the seventh transuranic element, and an actinide. Einsteinium was discovered as a component of the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Albert Einstein.  Its most common isotope einsteinium-253 (half-life 20. 47 days) is produced artificially from decay of californium-253 in a few dedicated high-power nuclear reactors with a total yield on the order of one milligram per year.  The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. 

Edmund Stoiber<====>9480<====>Edmund Stoiber Edmund Rüdiger Stoiber (born 28 September 1941) is a German politician, who was the 16th Minister President of the state of Bavaria between 1993 and 2007 and chairman of the Christian Social Union (CSU) between 1998 and 2007.  In 2002 he candidated for the office of Chancellor of Germany in the federal election but in one of the narrowest elections in German history lost against Gerhard Schröder.  On 18 January 2007, he announced his decision to step down from the posts of minister-president and party chairman by 30 September, after having been under fire in his own party for weeks.

Erfurt's old town is one of the most intact medieval cities in Germany   having survived World War II with little damage. 

Enya<====>9482<====>Enya    Eithne Pádraigín Ní Bhraonáin (anglicised as Enya Patricia Brennan; born 17 May 1961), known as Enya, is an Irish singer, songwriter, musician and producer.  Born into a musical family and raised in the Irish speaking area of Gweedore in County Donegal, Enya began her music career when she joined her family's Celtic band Clannad in 1980 on keyboards and backing vocals.  She left in 1982 with their manager and producer Nicky Ryan to pursue a solo career, with Ryan's wife Roma Ryan as her lyricist.  Enya developed her distinct sound over the following four years with multi-tracked vocals and keyboards with elements of new age, Celtic, classical, church, and folk music. 

East Berlin<====>9483<====>East Berlin    East Berlin (rus.  Восточный Берлин - Vostochniy Berlin) existed from 1949 to 1990 and consisted of the Soviet sector of Berlin established in 1945.  The American, British, and French sectors became West Berlin, strongly associated with West Germany, while East Berlin was the de facto capital of East Germany.  From 13 August 1961 until 9 November 1989, East Berlin was separated from West Berlin by the Berlin Wall. In East German official usage, it became widespread in the 1970s to refer to the Western part of the city as "Westberlin", whilst calling the Eastern part simply "Berlin". 

List of international environmental agreements<====>9486<====>List of international environmental agreements This is a list of international environmental agreements. Most of the following agreements are legally binding for countries that have formally ratified them.  Some, such as the Kyoto Protocol, differentiate between types of countries and each nation's respective responsibilities under the agreement.  Several hundred international environmental agreements exist but most link only a limited number of countries.  These bilateral or sometimes trilateral agreements are only binding for the countries that have ratified them but are nevertheless essential in the international environmental regime.  Including the major conventions listed below, more than 3,000 international environmental instruments have been identified by the Canada Research Chair in International Political Economy in its TIPEA project . 

Epsilon<====>9487<====>Epsilon  Epsilon (uppercase  , lowercase   or lunate  ;  ) is the fifth letter of the Greek alphabet, corresponding phonetically to a mid  front unrounded vowel  .  In the system of Greek numerals it has the value five.  It was derived from the Phoenician letter He .  Letters that arose from epsilon include the Roman E, Ë and Ɛ, and Cyrillic Е, È, Ё, Є and Э. The name of the letter was originally   ( ), but the name was changed to   (e psilon "simple e") in the Middle Ages to distinguish the letter from the digraph  , a former diphthong that had come to be pronounced the same as epsilon. 

Eta<====>9488<====>Eta  Eta (uppercase  , lowercase  ;   ē̂ta   or   ita  ) is the seventh letter of the Greek alphabet.  Originally denoting  a consonant /h/, its sound value in the classical Attic dialect of Ancient Greek was a long vowel  , raised to   in hellenistic Greek, a process known as iotacism. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 8.  It was derived from the Phoenician letter heth .  Letters that arose from eta include the Latin H and the Cyrillic letter И. 

Eskimo<====>9491<====>Eskimo  Eskimo is an English term for the indigenous peoples who have traditionally inhabited the northern circumpolar region from eastern Siberia (Russia) to across Alaska (of the United States), Canada, and Greenland.    The two main peoples known as "Eskimo" are: (1) the Alaskan Iñupiat peoples, Greenlandic Inuit, and the mass-grouping Inuit peoples of Canada, and (2) the Yupik of eastern Siberia and Alaska.  The Yupik comprise speakers of four distinct Yupik languages: one used in the Russian Far East and the others among people of Western Alaska, Southcentral Alaska and along the Gulf of Alaska coast. 

Epiphenomenalism<====>9496<====>Epiphenomenalism Epiphenomenalism is a mind–body philosophy marked by the belief that basic physical events (sense organs, neural impulses, and muscle contractions) are causal with respect to mental events (thought, consciousness, and cognition).  Mental events are viewed as completely dependent on physical functions and, as such, have no independent existence or causal efficacy; it is a mere appearance.  Fear seems to make the heart beat faster; though, according to epiphenomenalism, the state of the nervous system causes the heart to beat faster.Because mental events are a kind of overflow that cannot cause anything physical, yet have non-physical properties, epiphenomenalism is viewed as a form of property dualism. 

Esperantujo<====>9498<====>Esperantujo  Esperantujo ( ) or Esperantio   ( ) is the community of speakers of the Esperanto and their culture, as well the places and institutions where the language is used.  The term is used "as if it were a country. " Although it does not occupy its own area of Earth's surface, it can be said to constitute the 120 countries which have their own national Esperanto association. Etymology and terminologyThe word is formed analogously to country names.  In Esperanto, the names of countries were traditionally formed from the ethnic name of their inhabitants plus the suffix -ujo,  for example "France" was Francujo, from franco (a Frenchman). 

Ethernet<====>9499<====>Ethernet Ethernet   is a family of computer networking technologies commonly used in local area networks (LAN), metropolitan area networks (MAN) and wide area networks (WAN).    It was commercially introduced in 1980 and first standardized in 1983 as IEEE 802. 3,    and has since been refined to support higher bit rates and longer link distances.  Over time, Ethernet has largely replaced competing wired LAN technologies such as token ring, FDDI and ARCNET. The original 10BASE5 Ethernet uses coaxial cable as a shared medium, while the newer Ethernet variants use twisted pair and fiber optic links in conjunction with hubs or switches.

Edward Jenner<====>9506<====>Edward Jenner   Edward Jenner, FRS ( ; 17 May 1749 – 26 January 1823) was an English physician and scientist who was the pioneer of smallpox vaccine, the world's first vaccine. The terms "vaccine" and "vaccination" are derived from Variolae vaccinae (smallpox of the cow), the term devised by Jenner to denote cowpox.  He used it in 1796 in the long title of his Inquiry into the Variolae vaccinae known as the Cow Pox, in which he described the protective effect of cowpox against smallpox.  Jenner is often called "the father of immunology", and his work is said to have "saved more lives than the work of any other human".

Electronic music<====>9510<====>Electronic music    Electronic music is music that employs electronic musical instruments, digital instruments and circuitry-based music technology.  In general, a distinction can be made between sound produced using electromechanical means (electroacoustic music), and that produced using electronics only.  "The stuff of electronic music is electrically produced or modified sounds.  . . .  two basic definitions will help put some of the historical discussion in its place: purely electronic music versus electroacoustic music" ( ).   Electromechanical instruments include mechanical elements, such as strings, hammers, and so on, and electric elements, such as magnetic pickups, power amplifiers and loudspeakers. 

Edvard Grieg<====>9514<====>Edvard Grieg    Edvard Hagerup Grieg ( ; 15 June 1843 4 September 1907) was a Norwegian composer and pianist.  He is widely considered one of the leading Romantic era composers, and his music is part of the standard classical repertoire worldwide.  His use and development of Norwegian folk music in his own compositions put the music of Norway in the international spectrum, as well as helping to develop a national identity, much as Jean Sibelius and Antonín Dvořák did in Finland and Bohemia, respectively.Edvard Grieg is the most celebrated person from the city of Bergen, with numerous statues depicting his image, and many cultural entities named after him: the city's largest concert building (Grieghallen), its most advanced music school (Grieg Academy) and its professional choir (Edvard Grieg Kor). 

Emancipation Proclamation<====>9515<====>Emancipation Proclamation   The Emancipation Proclamation, or Proclamation 95, was a presidential proclamation and executive order issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863.   It changed the federal legal status of more than 3 million enslaved people in the designated areas of the South from slave to free.  As soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally free.  Ultimately, the rebel surrender liberated and resulted in the proclamation's application to all of the designated slaves.   It did not cover slaves in Union areas that were freed by state action (or by the 13th amendment in December 1865). 

Erwin Rommel<====>9516<====>Erwin Rommel Erwin Rommel (15 November 1891 – 14 October 1944) was a German general and military theorist.  Popularly known as the Desert Fox, he served as field marshal in the Wehrmacht of Nazi Germany  during World War II. Rommel was a highly decorated officer in World War I and was awarded the Pour le Mérite for his actions on the Italian Front.  In 1937 he published his classic book on military tactics, Infantry Attacks, drawing on his experiences from World War I.  In World War II, he distinguished himself as the commander of the 7th Panzer Division during the 1940 invasion of France. 

Edmund Husserl<====>9518<====>Edmund Husserl  Edmund Gustav Albrecht Husserl ( ;   ; 8 April 1859 – 27 April 1938)  was a German   philosopher who established the school of phenomenology.  In his early work, he elaborated critiques of historicism and of psychologism in logic based on analyses of intentionality.  In his mature work, he sought to develop a systematic foundational science based on the so-called phenomenological reduction.  Arguing that transcendental consciousness sets the limits of all possible knowledge, Husserl re-defined phenomenology as a transcendental-idealist philosophy.  Husserl's thought profoundly influenced the landscape of twentieth-century philosophy, and he remains a notable figure in contemporary philosophy and beyond. 

Electrical engineering<====>9531<====>Electrical engineering  Electrical engineering is a professional engineering discipline that generally deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism.  This field first became an identifiable occupation in the later half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electric power distribution and use.  Subsequently, broadcasting and recording media made electronics part of daily life.   The invention of the transistor, and later the integrated circuit, brought down the cost of electronics to the point they can be used in almost any household object. Electrical engineering has now subdivided into a wide range of subfields including electronics, digital computers, computer engineering, power engineering, telecommunications, control systems, radio-frequency engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, and microelectronics. 

Electromagnetism<====>9532<====>Electromagnetism    Electromagnetism is a branch of physics involving the study of the electromagnetic force, a type of physical interaction that occurs between electrically charged particles.  The electromagnetic force usually exhibits electromagnetic fields such as electric fields, magnetic fields and light, and is one of the four fundamental interactions (commonly called forces) in nature.  The other three fundamental interactions are the strong interaction, the weak interaction and gravitation.  The word electromagnetism is a compound form of two Greek terms, ἤλεκτρον ēlektron, "amber", and μαγνῆτις λίθος magnētis lithos,  which means "Μagnesian stone",  a type of iron ore. 

Euphemism<====>9534<====>Euphemism A euphemism   is a generally innocuous word or expression used in place of one that may be found offensive or suggest something unpleasant.   Some euphemisms are intended to amuse; while others use bland, inoffensive terms for things the user wishes to downplay.  Euphemisms are used to refer to taboo topics (such as disability, sex, excretion, and death) in a polite way, or to mask profanity.  EtymologyThe word comes from Greek   (euphemia) "the use of words of good omen", which is a compound of eû ( ) "good, well" and phḗmē (φήμη) "prophetic speech; rumour, talk". 

Edmund Spenser<====>9536<====>Edmund Spenser    Edmund Spenser ( ; 1552/1553 – 13 January 1599) was an English poet best known for The Faerie Queene, an epic poem and fantastical allegory celebrating the Tudor dynasty and Elizabeth I.  He is recognized as one of the premier craftsmen of nascent Modern English verse, and is often considered one of the greatest poets in the English language. LifeEdmund Spenser was born in East Smithfield, London, around the year 1552, though there is some ambiguity as to the exact date of his birth.  His parenthood is obscure, but he was probably the son of John Spenser,  a journeyman clothmaker. 

Electricity generation<====>9540<====>Electricity generationElectricity generation is the process of generating electric power from sources of primary energy.  For electric utilities in the electric power industry, it is the first stage in the delivery of electricity to end users, the other stages being transmission, distribution, energy storage and recovery, using pumped-storage methods. A characteristic of electricity is that it is not a primary energy freely present in nature in remarkable amounts and it must be produced.  Production is carried out in power plants.  Electricity is most often generated at a power station by electromechanical generators, primarily driven by heat engines fueled by combustion or nuclear fission but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and wind. 

Design of experiments<====>9541<====>Design of experiments   The design of experiments (DOE, DOX, or experimental design) is the design of any task that aims to describe or explain the variation of information under conditions that are hypothesized to reflect the variation.  The term is generally associated with experiments in which the design introduces conditions that directly affect the variation, but may also refer to the design of quasi-experiments, in which natural conditions that influence the variation are selected for observation. In its simplest form, an experiment aims at predicting the outcome by introducing a change of the preconditions, which is represented by one or more independent variables, also referred to as "input variables" or "predictor variables. 

Empirical research<====>9545<====>Empirical researchEmpirical research is research using empirical evidence.  It is a way of gaining knowledge by means of direct and indirect observation or experience.  Empiricism values such research more than other kinds.  Empirical evidence (the record of one's direct observations or experiences) can be analyzed quantitatively or qualitatively.  Quantifying the evidence or making sense of it in qualitative form, a researcher can answer empirical questions, which should be clearly defined and answerable with the evidence collected (usually called data).  Research design varies by field and by the question being investigated.  Many researchers combine qualitative and quantitative forms of analysis to better answer questions which cannot be studied in laboratory settings, particularly in the social sciences and in education. 

Engineering statistics<====>9546<====>Engineering statisticsEngineering statistics combines engineering and statistics:  Design of Experiments (DOE) is a methodology for formulating scientific and engineering problems using statistical models.  The protocol specifies a randomization procedure for the experiment and specifies the primary data-analysis, particularly in hypothesis testing.  In a secondary analysis, the statistical analyst further examines the data to suggest other questions and to help plan future experiments.  In engineering applications, the goal is often to optimize a process or product, rather than to subject a scientific hypothesis to test of its predictive adequacy.  Box, G. 

Edgar Allan Poe<====>9549<====>Edgar Allan PoeEdgar Allan Poe ( ; born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849) was an American writer, editor, and literary critic.  Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre.   He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story.  Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. 

Electricity<====>9550<====>Electricity   Electricity is the set of  physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of electric charge.  Although initially considered a phenomenon separate from magnetism, since the development of Maxwell's equations, both are recognized as part of a single phenomenon: electromagnetism.  Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others.  The presence of an electric charge, which can be either positive or negative, produces an electric field.  The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field. When a charge is placed in a location with a non-zero electric field, a force will act on it. 

Empedocles<====>9553<====>Empedocles  Empedocles ( ;    , Empedoklēs; c.  490 – c.  430 BC) was a Greek pre-Socratic philosopher and a citizen of Acragas (Agrigentum), a Greek city in Sicily.  Empedocles' philosophy is best known for originating the cosmogenic theory of the four classical elements.  He also proposed forces he called Love and Strife which would mix as well as separate the elements.  These physical speculations were part of a history of the universe which also dealt with the origin and development of life. Influenced by the Pythagoreans, Empedocles was a vegetarian who supported the doctrine of reincarnation. 

Ericaceae<====>9555<====>Ericaceae   The Ericaceae are a family of flowering plants, commonly known as the heath or heather family, found most commonly in acid and infertile growing conditions.  The family is large, with c.  4250 known species spread across 124 genera,    making it the 14th most species-rich family of flowering plants.   The many well-known and economically important members of the Ericaceae include the cranberry, blueberry, huckleberry, rhododendron (including azaleas), and various common heaths and heathers (Erica, Cassiope, Daboecia, and Calluna for example).  DescriptionThe Ericaceae contain a morphologically diverse range of taxa, including herbs, dwarf shrubs, shrubs, and trees. 

Electrical network<====>9559<====>Electrical network  An electrical network is an interconnection of electrical components (e. g.  batteries, resistors, inductors, capacitors, switches) or a model of such an interconnection, consisting of electrical elements (e. g.  voltage sources, current sources, resistances, inductances, capacitances).    An electrical circuit is a network consisting of a closed loop, giving a return path for the current.  Linear electrical networks, a special type consisting only of sources (voltage or current), linear lumped elements (resistors, capacitors, inductors), and linear distributed elements (transmission lines), have the property that signals are linearly superimposable.   They are thus more easily analyzed, using powerful frequency domain methods such as Laplace transforms, to determine DC response, AC response, and transient response. 

Empty set<====>9566<====>Empty set In mathematics, and more specifically set theory, the empty set is the unique set having no elements; its size or cardinality (count of elements in a set) is zero.  Some axiomatic set theories ensure that the empty set exists by including an axiom of empty set; in other theories, its existence can be deduced.  Many possible properties of sets are vacuously true for the empty set. Null set was once a common synonym for "empty set", but is now a technical term in measure theory and describes a set that is not necessarily empty.   The empty set may also be called the void set. 

Egoism<====>9567<====>EgoismEgoism is an ethical theory that treats self-interest as the foundation of morality. OriginLatin word "ego" meaning "I" .FormsEthical egoism, the doctrine that holds that individuals ought to do what is in their self-interestPsychological egoism, the doctrine that holds that individuals are always motivated by self-interestRational egoism, the belief that it is rational to act in one's self-interestThe terms "egoism" and "egotism" may also refer to:Egotism, an excessive or exaggerated sense of self-importanceSolipsism (sometimes called egoism), the belief that only one's self exists, or that only the experiences of one's self can be verifiedEgoist anarchism, a form of anarchism, as most often represented by Max StirnerEgocentrism, lack of emotional obligation to "put oneself in other peoples' shoes"Philosophers who developed philosophical systems of egoismFriedrich NietzscheAyn RandMax StirnerSee also Altruism, the selfless concern for the welfare of othersEnlightened self-interest, a philosophy in ethics which states that persons who act to further the interests of others (or the interests of the group or groups to which they belong), ultimately serve their own self-interest.Individualism, a focus on the individual as opposed to societyIndividualist anarchism, anarchism that exalts the supremacy of the individualMachiavellianism, a tendency to deceive and manipulate others for personal gainPost-egoism, a philosophy aiming beyond egoismSelfishness, denoting the precedence given in thought or deed to the self, i.e., self-interest or self concernSelfism, a pejorative term referring to any philosophy, doctrine, or tendency that upholds explicitly selfish principles as being desirableSuitheism, the belief in self as a deityReferences 

Endomorphism<====>9569<====>Endomorphism In mathematics, an endomorphism is a morphism (or homomorphism) from a mathematical object to itself.   For example, an endomorphism of a vector space   is a linear map,  , and an endomorphism of a group,  , is a group homomorphism  .  In general, we can talk about endomorphisms in any category.  In the category of sets, endomorphisms are functions from a set S to itself. In any category, the composition of any two endomorphisms of   is again an endomorphism of  .   It follows that the set of all endomorphisms of   forms a monoid, denoted   (or   to emphasize the category  ). 

Eric Hoffer<====>9574<====>Eric Hoffer  Eric Hoffer (July 25, 1902 – May 21, 1983)  was an American moral and social philosopher.  He was the author of ten books and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in February 1983.  His first book, The True Believer (1951), was widely recognized as a classic, receiving critical acclaim from both scholars and laymen, "Hoffer, Eric".  Encyclopædia Britannica, from Encyclopædia Britannica 2003 Ultimate Reference Suite CD-ROM.  Copyright 1994–2002 Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.

Life and careerMuch of the details of Hoffer's early life is through his own accounts, with no concrete proof, other than his word, and some aspects of it have been challenged by historians. 

European Coal and Steel Community<====>9577<====>European Coal and Steel Community  The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was an organisation of 6 European countries set up after World War II to regulate their industrial production under a centralised authority.  It was formally established in 1951 by the Treaty of Paris, signed by Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.  The ECSC was the first international organisation to be based on the principles of supranationalism,  and started the process of formal integration which ultimately led to the European Union. The ECSC was first proposed by French foreign minister Robert Schuman on 9 May 1950 as a way to prevent further war between France and Germany. 

European Economic Community<====>9578<====>European Economic CommunityThe European Economic Community (EEC) was a regional organisation which aimed to bring about economic integration among its member states.  It was created by the Treaty of Rome of 1957.   Upon the formation of the European Union (EU) in 1993, the EEC was incorporated and renamed as the European Community (EC).  In 2009 the EC's institutions were absorbed into the EU's wider framework and the community ceased to exist. The Community's initial aim was to bring about economic integration, including a common market and customs union, among its six founding members: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany. 

European Free Trade Association<====>9580<====>European Free Trade AssociationThe European Free Trade Association (EFTA) is a regional trade organization and free trade area consisting of four European states: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.The organization operates in parallel with the European Union (EU), and all four member states participate in the European Single Market.   They are not, however, party to the European Union Customs Union. EFTA was historically one of the two dominant western European trade blocs, but is now much smaller and closely associated with its historical competitor, the European Union.  It was established on 3 May 1960 to serve as an alternative trade bloc for those European states that were unable or unwilling to join the then European Economic Community (EEC) (which subsequently became the European Union). 

European Parliament<====>9581<====>European Parliament    The European Parliament (EP) is the directly elected parliamentary institution of the European Union (EU).  Together with the Council of the European Union (the Council) and the European Commission, it exercises the legislative function of the EU.  The Parliament is composed of 751 members, who represent the second-largest democratic electorate in the world (after the Parliament of India) and the largest trans-national democratic electorate in the world (375 million eligible voters in 2009). It has been directly elected every five years by universal suffrage since 1979.  However, voter turnout at European Parliament elections has fallen consecutively at each election since that date, and has been under 50% since 1999. 

European Council<====>9582<====>European CouncilThe European Council, charged with defining the European Union's (EU) overall political direction and priorities, is the institution of the EU that comprises the heads of state or government of the member states, along with the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission.  The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy also takes part in its meetings.Established as an informal summit in 1975, the European Council was formalised as an institution in 2009 upon the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. 

Euthanasia<====>9587<====>EuthanasiaEuthanasia (from  ; "good death": εὖ, eu; "well" or "good" – θάνατος, thanatos; "death") is the practice of intentionally ending a life to relieve pain and suffering.   There are different euthanasia laws in each country.  The British House of Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics defines euthanasia as "a deliberate intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life, to relieve intractable suffering".In the Netherlands and Belgium, euthanasia is understood as "termination of life by a doctor at the request of a patient".   The Dutch law however, does not use the term 'euthanasia' but includes it under the broader definition of "assisted suicide and termination of life on request". 

Extraterrestrial life<====>9588<====>Extraterrestrial life   Extraterrestrial life, Where "extraterrestrial" is derived from the Latin extra ("beyond", "not of") and   ("of Earth", "belonging to Earth").   also called alien life (or, if it is a sentient or relatively complex individual, an "extraterrestrial" or "alien"), is life that occurs outside of Earth and that probably did not originate from Earth.  These hypothetical life forms may range from simple prokaryotes to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. The Drake equation speculates about the existence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.  The science of extraterrestrial life in all its forms is known as exobiology. 

European Strategic Program on Research in Information Technology<====>9589<====>European Strategic Program on Research in Information TechnologyEuropean Strategic Program on Research in Information Technology (ESPRIT) was a series of integrated programmes of information technology research and development projects and industrial technology transfer measures.  It was a European Union initiative managed by the Directorate General for Industry (DG III) of the European Commission.  ProgrammesFive ESPRIT programmes (ESPRIT 0 to ESPRIT 4) ran consecutively from 1983 to 1998.  ESPRIT 4 was succeeded by the Information Society Technologies (IST) programme in 1999. ProjectsSome of the projects and products supported by ESPRIT are:  SIP - Advanced Algorithms and Architectures for Speech and Image Processing, a partnership between Thomson-CSF, AEG, CSELT and ENSPS (ESPRIT P26), to develop the algorithmic and architectural techniques required for recognizing and understanding spoken or visual signals and to demonstrate these techniques in suitable applications. 

E. E. Cummings<====>9591<====>E.  E.  Cummings  Edward Estlin "E.  E. " Cummings (October 14, 1894 – September 3, 1962), often styled as e e cummings, as he sometimes signed his name, was an American poet, painter, essayist, author, and playwright.  He wrote approximately 2900 poems, two autobiographical novels, four plays, and several essays. Life Early yearsEdward Estlin Cummings was born on October 14, 1894, in Cambridge, Massachusetts to Edward Cummings and the former Rebecca Haswell Clarke, a well-known Unitarian couple in the city.  His father was a professor at Harvard University and later became nationally known as the minister of South Congregational Church in Boston, Massachusetts. 

East River<====>9592<====>East River    The East River is a salt water tidal estuary in New York City.  The waterway, which is actually not a river despite its name, connects Upper New York Bay on its south end to Long Island Sound on its north end.  It separates the borough of Queens on Long Island from the Bronx on the North American mainland, and also divides Manhattan from Queens and Brooklyn, which is also on Long Island.  Hodges, Godfrey.  "East RIver" in Jackson, pp. 393-93  Because of its connection to Long Island Sound, it was once also known as the Sound River. 

Existentialism<====>9593<====>Existentialism  Existentialism ( )  is a tradition of philosophical enquiry associated mainly with certain 19th and 20th-century European philosophers who, despite profound doctrinal differences,Oxford Companion to Philosophy, ed.  Ted Honderich, New York (1995), p.  259.   shared the belief that philosophical thinking begins with the human subject—not merely the thinking subject, but the acting, feeling, living human individual.   While the predominant value of existentialist thought is commonly acknowledged to be freedom, its primary virtue is authenticity.   In the view of the existentialist, the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been called "the existential attitude", or a sense of disorientation, confusion, or dread in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world. 

Ellipsis<====>9596<====>Ellipsis   An ellipsis (plural ellipses; from the  , élleipsis, "omission" or " ") is a series of dots (typically three, such as "…") that usually indicates an intentional omission of a word, sentence, or whole section from a text without altering its original meaning.  Background Depending on their context and placement in a sentence, ellipses can  indicate an unfinished thought, a leading statement, a slight pause, an echoing voice, or a nervous or awkward silence.   Aposiopesis is the use of an ellipsis to trail off into silence—for example: "But I thought he was    When placed at the beginning or end of a sentence, the ellipsis can also inspire a feeling of melancholy or longing. 

Enola Gay<====>9597<====>Enola Gay    } The Enola Gay ( ) is a Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber, named for Enola Gay Tibbets, the mother of the pilot, Colonel Paul Tibbets, who selected the aircraft while it was still on the assembly line.  On 6 August 1945, during the final stages of World War II, it became the first aircraft to drop an atomic bomb.  The bomb, code-named "Little Boy", was targeted at the city of Hiroshima, Japan, and caused unprecedented destruction.  Enola Gay participated in the second atomic attack as the weather reconnaissance aircraft for the primary target of Kokura. 

Electronvolt<====>9598<====>Electronvolt In physics, the electronvolt   (symbol eV, also written electron-volt and electron volt) is a unit of energy equal to approximately   joules (symbol J).  By definition, it is the amount of energy gained (or lost) by the charge of a single electron moving across an electric potential difference of one volt.  Thus it is 1 volt (1 joule per coulomb,  ) multiplied by the elementary charge (e, or  ).  Therefore, one electronvolt is equal to    Historically, the electronvolt was devised as a standard unit of measure through its usefulness in electrostatic particle accelerator sciences because a particle with charge q has an energy   after passing through the potential V; if q is quoted in integer units of the elementary charge and the terminal bias in volts, one gets an energy in eV. 

Electrochemistry<====>9601<====>ElectrochemistryElectrochemistry is the branch of physical chemistry that studies the relationship between electricity, as a measurable and quantitative phenomenon, and identifiable chemical change, with either electricity considered an outcome of a particular chemical change or vice versa.  These reactions involve electric charges moving between electrodes and an electrolyte (or ionic species in a solution).  Thus electrochemistry deals with the interaction between electrical energy and chemical change. When a chemical reaction is caused by an externally supplied current, as in electrolysis, or if an electric current is produced by a spontaneous chemical reaction as in a battery, it is called an electrochemical reaction. 

Edinburgh<====>9602<====>EdinburghEdinburgh ( ;  ;  ) is the capital city of Scotland and one of its 32 council areas.  It is located in Lothian on the Firth of Forth's southern shore. Recognised as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is home to the Scottish Parliament and the seat of the monarchy in Scotland.  Historically part of Midlothian, the city has long been a centre of education, particularly in the fields of medicine, Scots law, literature, the sciences and engineering.  It is the second largest financial centre in the United Kingdom  and the city's historical and cultural attractions have made it the United Kingdom's second most popular tourist destination, attracting over one million overseas visitors each year. 

Ernest Rutherford<====>9603<====>Ernest Rutherford Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson,    (30 August 1871 – 19 October 1937) was a New Zealand-born British physicist who came to be known as the father of nuclear physics.Encyclopædia Britannica considers him to be the greatest experimentalist since Michael Faraday (1791–1867).  In early work, Rutherford discovered the concept of radioactive half-life, proved that radioactivity involved the nuclear transmutation of one chemical element to another, and also differentiated and named alpha and beta radiation.    This work was performed at McGill University in Canada. 

Many-worlds interpretation<====>9604<====>Many-worlds interpretationThe many-worlds interpretation is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that asserts the objective reality of the universal wavefunction and denies the actuality of wavefunction collapse.  Many-worlds implies that all possible alternate histories and futures are real, each representing an actual "world" (or "universe").  In layman's terms, the hypothesis states there is a very large—perhaps infinite   —number of universes, and everything that could possibly have happened in our past, but did not, has occurred in the past of some other universe or universes.  The theory is also referred to as MWI, the relative state formulation, the Everett interpretation, the theory of the universal wavefunction, many-universes interpretation,  multi-history or just many-worlds. 

E-commerce<====>9611<====>E-commerce  E-commerce is a transaction of buying or selling online.  Electronic commerce draws on technologies such as mobile commerce, electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing, online transaction processing, electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems.  Modern electronic commerce typically uses the World Wide Web for at least one part of the transaction's life cycle although it may also use other technologies such as e-mail.  Typical e-commerce transactions include the purchase of online books (such as Amazon) and music purchases (music download in the form of digital distribution such as iTunes Store), and to a less extent, customized/personalized online liquor store inventory services. 

Euler's formula<====>9613<====>Euler's formula  Euler's formula, named after Leonhard Euler, is a mathematical formula in complex analysis that establishes the fundamental relationship between the trigonometric functions and the complex exponential function.  Euler's formula states that for any real number   e^{ix} = \cos x + i\sin x, where   is the base of the natural logarithm,   is the imaginary unit, and   and   are the trigonometric functions cosine and sine respectively, with the argument   given in radians.  This complex exponential function is sometimes denoted   ("cosine plus i sine").  The formula is still valid if   is a complex number, and so some authors refer to the more general complex version as Euler's formula. 

Édouard Manet<====>9615<====>Édouard Manet    Édouard Manet (  or  ;  ; 23 January 1832 – 30 April 1883) was a French painter.  He was one of the first 19th-century artists to paint modern life, and a pivotal figure in the transition from Realism to Impressionism. Born into an upper-class household with strong political connections, Manet rejected the future originally envisioned for him, and became engrossed in the world of painting.  His early masterworks, The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe) and Olympia, both 1863, caused great controversy and served as rallying points for the young painters who would create Impressionism. 

Evolutionarily stable strategy<====>9616<====>Evolutionarily stable strategy An evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is a strategy which, if adopted by a population in a given environment, cannot be invaded by any alternative strategy that is initially rare.   It is relevant in game theory, behavioural ecology, and evolutionary psychology.  An ESS is an equilibrium refinement of the Nash equilibrium.  It is a Nash equilibrium that is "evolutionarily" stable: once it is fixed in a population, natural selection alone is sufficient to prevent alternative (mutant) strategies from invading successfully.  The theory is not intended to deal with the possibility of gross external changes to the environment that bring new selective forces to bear. 

Extremophile<====>9619<====>Extremophile  An extremophile (from Latin   meaning "extreme" and Greek   ( ) meaning "love") is an organism that thrives in physically or geochemically extreme conditions that are detrimental to most life on Earth.    In contrast, organisms that live in more moderate environments may be termed mesophiles or neutrophiles. CharacteristicsIn the 1980s and 1990s, biologists found that microbial life has great flexibility for surviving in extreme environments—niches that are acidic or extraordinarily hot, for example—that would be completely inhospitable to complex organisms.  Some scientists even concluded that life may have begun on Earth in hydrothermal vents far under the ocean's surface. 

Education reform<====>9620<====>Education reformEducation reform is the name given to the goal of changing public education.  Historically, reforms have taken different forms because the motivations of reformers have differed.  However, since the 1980s, education reform has been focused on changing the existing system from one focused on inputs to one focused on outputs (i. e. , student achievement).  In the United States, education reform acknowledges and encourages public education as the primary source of K-12 education for American youth.  Education reformers desire to make public education into a market (in the form of an input-output system), where accountability creates high-stakes from curriculum standards tied to standardized tests. 

Ellensburg, Washington<====>9621<====>Ellensburg, Washington  Ellensburg is a city in, and the county seat of, Kittitas County, Washington, United States.  The population was 19,786 in a 2016 census estimate.  Ellensburg is located just east of the Cascade Range on Interstate 90 and is known as the most centrally located city in the state.  Ellensburg is the home of Central Washington University (CWU). The surrounding Kittitas Valley is internationally known for the timothy hay that it produces.  There are several local hay brokering and processing operations that ship to Pacific Rim countries.  Downtown Ellensburg has many historic buildings, many of which were constructed in the late 19th century. 

Eugene, Oregon<====>9623<====>Eugene, Oregon  Eugene (   ) is a city of the Pacific Northwest located in the U. S.  state of Oregon.  It is located at the southern end of the Willamette Valley, near the confluence of the McKenzie and Willamette Rivers, about   east of the Oregon Coast.  As of the 2010 census, Eugene had a population of 156,185; it is the second most populous city in the state (after Portland) and the county seat of Lane County.The Eugene-Springfield, Oregon metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is the 146th largest metropolitan statistical area in the US and the third-largest in the state, behind the Portland Metropolitan Area and the Salem Metropolitan Area. 

Elizabeth Barrett Browning<====>9627<====>Elizabeth Barrett Browning   Elizabeth Barrett Browning (née Moulton-Barrett,  ; 6 March 1806 – 29 June 1861) was an English poet of the Victorian era, popular in Britain and the United States during her lifetime. Born in County Durham, the eldest of 12 children, Elizabeth Barrett wrote poetry from about the age of six.  Her mother's collection of her poems forms one of the largest extant collections of juvenilia by any English writer.  At 15 she became ill, suffering intense head and spinal pain for the rest of her life.  Later in life she also developed lung problems, possibly tuberculosis. 

Enlil<====>9628<====>Enlil Enlil (   , "Lord Storm")   was the ancient Mesopotamian god of wind, air, earth, and storms.   He is first attested as the chief deity of the Sumerian pantheon,  but he was later worshipped by the Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and Hurrians.  Enlil's primary center of worship was the Ekur temple in the city of Nippur, which was believed to have been built by Enlil himself and was regarded as the "mooring-rope" of heaven and earth.  He himself was believed to be so holy that not even the other gods could look upon him. 

Ecology<====>9630<====>Ecology  Ecology (from  , "house", or "environment"; -λογία, "study of")  is the scientific analysis and study of interactions among organisms and their environment.   See glossary of ecology.    It is an interdisciplinary field that includes biology, geography, and Earth science.  Ecology includes the study of interactions that organisms have with each other, other organisms, and with abiotic components of their environment.  Topics of interest to ecologists include the diversity, distribution, amount (biomass), and number (population) of particular organisms, as well as cooperation and competition between organisms, both within and among ecosystems. 

Glossary of country dance terms<====>9631<====>Glossary of country dance terms An alphabetic list of modern Country dance terminology;Active Couple - for long-ways sets with more than one couple dancing, the active couple is the couple doing the more complicated movement during any given portion of the dance.  For duple dances, that is every other couple, and for triple dances, every third couple is the active couple.   The term is applicable to triplet dances, where typically the active couple is the only couple that is active.  In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, only the active couple—the "1st couple"—initiated the action, other couples supporting their movements and joining in as needed, until they also took their turn as leading couples. 

Ecosystem<====>9632<====>Ecosystem An ecosystem is a community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment (things like air, water and mineral soil), interacting as a system.    These biotic and abiotic components are regarded as linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows.As ecosystems are defined by the network of interactions among organisms, and between organisms and their environment, Schulze et al.  (2005), p. 400  they can be of any size but usually encompass specific, limited spaces  (although some scientists say that the entire planet is an ecosystem). 

E (mathematical constant)<====>9633<====>E (mathematical constant)    The number   is a mathematical constant, approximately equal to 2. 71828, which appears in many different settings throughout mathematics.  It was discovered by the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli while studying compound interest,    where   arises as the limit of   as   approaches infinity.  The number   can also be calculated as the sum of the infinite series  e =  \displaystyle\sum\limits_{n = 0}^{ \infty} \dfrac{1}{n!} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1\cdot 2} + \frac{1}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3} + \cdots Also called Euler's number after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler,   is different from  , the Euler–Mascheroni constant, which is sometimes called simply Euler's constant. 

Euler–Maclaurin formula<====>9637<====>Euler–Maclaurin formulaIn mathematics, the Euler–Maclaurin formula provides a powerful connection between integrals (see calculus) and sums.   It can be used to approximate integrals by finite sums, or conversely to evaluate finite sums and infinite series using integrals and the machinery of calculus.  For example, many asymptotic expansions are derived from the formula, and Faulhaber's formula for the sum of powers is an immediate consequence. The formula was discovered independently by Leonhard Euler and Colin Maclaurin around 1735 (and later generalized as Darboux's formula).   Euler needed it to compute slowly converging infinite series while Maclaurin used it to calculate integrals. 

Epimenides paradox<====>9638<====>Epimenides paradoxThe Epimenides paradox reveals a problem with self-reference in logic. It is named after the Cretan philosopher Epimenides of Knossos (alive circa 600 BC) who is credited with the original statement. A typical description of the problem is given in the book Gödel, Escher, Bach, by Douglas Hofstadter:Epimenides was a Cretan who made one immortal statement: "All Cretans are liars. "A paradox of self-reference arises when one considers whether it is possible for Epimenides to have spoken the truth. Logical paradoxThomas Fowler (1869) states the paradox as follows: "Epimenides the Cretan says, 'that all the Cretans are liars,' but Epimenides is himself a Cretan; therefore he is himself a liar. 

Engine<====>9640<====>Engine  An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one form of energy into mechanical energy.    Heat engines burn a fuel to create heat which is then used to do work.  Electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion; pneumatic motors use compressed air; and clockwork motors in wind-up toys use elastic energy.  In biological systems, molecular motors, like myosins in muscles, use chemical energy to create forces and eventually motion. TerminologyThe word engine derives from  Old French  , from the Latin ingenium–the root of the word  .  Pre-industrial weapons of war, such as catapults, trebuchets and battering rams, were called siege engines, and knowledge of how to construct them was often treated as a military secret. 

Economic and monetary union<====>9643<====>Economic and monetary union  An economic and monetary union is a type of trade bloc which is composed of an economic union (common market and customs union) with a monetary union. It is to be distinguished from a mere monetary union (e.g. the Latin Monetary Union in the 19th century), which does not involve a common market.  This is the sixth stage of economic integration. EMU is established through a currency-related trade pact. An intermediate step between pure EMU and a complete economic integration is the fiscal union.List of economic and monetary unions Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union (1999/2002) with the Euro for the Eurozone membersde facto the OECS Eastern Caribbean Currency Union with the East Caribbean dollar in the CSME (2006) de facto Switzerland–Liechtenstein Additionally the autonomous and dependent territories, such as some of the EU member state special territories, are sometimes treated as separate customs territory from their mainland state or have varying arrangements of formal or de facto customs union, common market and currency union (or combinations thereof) with the mainland and in regards to third countries through the trade pacts signed by the mainland state.

European Environment Agency<====>9644<====>European Environment Agency  The European Environment Agency (EEA) is the agency of the European Union (EU) that provides independent information on the environment, thereby helping those involved in developing, adopting, implementing and evaluating environmental policy, as well as informing the general public.   The agency is governed by a management board composed of representatives of the governments of its 33 member states, a European Commission representative and two scientists appointed by the European Parliament, assisted by a committee of scientists. The EEA was established by the European Economic Community (EEC) Regulation 1210/1990 (amended by EEC Regulation 933/1999 and EC Regulation 401/2009) and became operational in 1994. 

Erlang (programming language)<====>9646<====>Erlang (programming language)  Erlang (   ) is a general-purpose, concurrent, functional programming language, as well as a garbage-collected runtime system. The term Erlang is used interchangeably with Erlang/OTP, or OTP, which consists of the Erlang runtime system, a number of ready-to-use components mainly written in Erlang, and a set of design principles for Erlang programs.  The Erlang runtime system is known for its designs that are well suited for systems with the following characteristics:DistributedFault-tolerantSoft real-time, Highly available, non-stop applicationsHot swapping, where code can be changed without stopping a system.  The Erlang programming language is known for the following properties: Hitchhiker’s Tour of theBEAM – Robert Virding   Immutable dataPattern matchingFunctional programmingThe sequential subset of the Erlang language supports eager evaluation, single assignment, and dynamic typing. 

Euphoria (programming language)<====>9647<====>Euphoria (programming language) Euphoria is a programming language originally created by Robert Craig of Rapid Deployment Software  in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  Initially developed (though not publicly released) on the Atari ST,  the first commercial release  was for the 16-bit DOS platform and was proprietary.  In 2006, with the release of version 3,  Euphoria became open-source software.  The openEuphoria Group continues to administer and develop the project.    In December 2010, the openEuphoria Group released version 4  of openEuphoria along with a new identity and mascot for the project.  OpenEuphoria is currently available for Windows, Linux, macOS and three flavors of . 

Energy<====>9649<====>Energy In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on, or to heat, the object.  The second law of thermodynamics imposes limitations on the capacity of a system to transfer energy by performing work, since some of the system's energy might necessarily be "consumed" in the form of heat instead.  See e. g. Energy is a conserved quantity; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed.  The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton. 

Expected value<====>9653<====>Expected value In probability theory, the expected value of a random variable, intuitively, is the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents.  For example, the expected value in rolling a six-sided dic e is 3. 5, because the average of all the numbers that come up in an extremely large number of rolls is close to 3. 5.  Less roughly, the law of large numbers states that the arithmetic mean of the values almost surely converges to the expected value as the number of repetitions approaches infinity.  The expected value is also known as the expectation, mathematical expectation, EV, average, mean value, mean, or first moment. 

Electric light<====>9656<====>Electric light    An electric light is a device that produces visible light from electric current.  It is the most common form of artificial lighting and is essential to modern society,  providing interior lighting for buildings and exterior light for evening and nighttime activities.  In technical usage, a replaceable component that produces light from electricity is called a lamp.   Lamps are commonly called light bulbs; for example, the incandescent light bulb.Lamps usually have a base made of ceramic, metal, glass or plastic, which secures the lamp in the socket of a light fixture. 

Edgar Rice Burroughs<====>9657<====>Edgar Rice Burroughs  Edgar Rice Burroughs (September 1, 1875 – March 19, 1950) was an American fiction writer best known for his celebrated and prolific output in the adventure and science-fiction genres.    Among the most notable of his creations are the jungle man Tarzan, the heroic Mars adventurer John Carter and the fictional landmass within Earth known as Pellucidar.  Burroughs' California ranch is now the center of the Tarzana neighborhood in Los Angeles. BiographyEarly life and familyBurroughs was born on September 1, 1875, in Chicago, Illinois (he later lived for many years in the suburb of Oak Park), the fourth son of Major George Tyler Burroughs (1833–1913), a businessman and Civil War veteran, and his wife, Mary Evaline (Zieger) Burroughs (1840–1920). 

Eugène Viollet-le-Duc<====>9658<====>Eugène Viollet-le-Duc  Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc ( ; 27 January 1814 – 17 September 1879)  was a French architect and theorist, famous for his interpretive "restorations" of medieval buildings.  Born in Paris, he was a major Gothic Revival architect. His works were largely restorative and few of his independent building designs were ever realised.  Strongly contrary to the prevailing Beaux-Arts architectural trend of his time, much of his design work was largely derided by his contemporaries.  He was the architect hired to design the internal structure of the Statue of Liberty, but died before the project was completed. 

Endocarditis<====>9659<====>Endocarditis Endocarditis is an inflammation of the inner layer of the heart, the endocardium.  It usually involves the heart valves.  Other structures that may be involved include the interventricular septum, the chordae tendineae, the mural endocardium, or the surfaces of intracardiac devices.  Endocarditis is characterized by lesions, known as vegetations, which is a mass of platelets, fibrin, microcolonies of microorganisms, and scant inﬂammatory cells.In the subacute form of infective endocarditis, the vegetation may also include a center of granulomatous tissue, which may fibrose or calcify.    There are several ways to classify endocarditis. 

Euler's sum of powers conjecture<====>9660<====>Euler's sum of powers conjectureEuler's conjecture is a disproved conjecture in mathematics related to Fermat's last theorem.   It was proposed by Leonhard Euler in 1769.  It states that for all integers   and   greater than 1, if the sum of    th powers of positive integers is itself a  th power, then   is greater than or equal to  . The conjecture represents an attempt to generalize Fermat's last theorem, which is the special case  : if  , then  . Although the conjecture holds for the case   (which follows from Fermat's last theorem for the third powers), it was disproved for   and  . 

Book of Exodus<====>9662<====>Book of Exodus  The Book of Exodus or, simply, Exodus (from  , éxodos, meaning "going out";  , we'elleh shəmōṯ, "These are the names", the beginning words of the text: "These are the names of the sons of Israel"  ), is the second book of the Torah and the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament) immediately following Genesis.  The book tells how the Israelites leave slavery in Egypt through the strength of Yahweh, the God who has chosen Israel as his people.  Led by their prophet Moses they journey through the wilderness to Mount Sinai, where Yahweh promises them the land of Canaan (the "Promised Land") in return for their faithfulness. 

Electronics<====>9663<====>Electronics  Electronics is the science of controlling electrical energy electrically, in which the electrons have a fundamental role.  Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components (such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, integrated circuits, optoelectronics, and sensors), associated passive electrical components, and interconnection technologies.  Commonly, electronic devices contain circuitry consisting primarily or exclusively of active semiconductors supplemented with passive elements; such a circuit is described as an electronic circuit. The science of electronics is considered to be a branch of physics and electrical engineering.   The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible. 

Erewhon<====>9664<====>ErewhonErewhon: or, Over the Range    is a novel by Samuel Butler which was first published anonymously in 1872.   The title is also the name of a country, supposedly discovered by the protagonist.  In the novel, it is not revealed where Erewhon is, but it is clear that it is a fictional country.  Butler meant the title to be understood as the word "nowhere" backwards even though the letters "h" and "w" are transposed.    The book is a satire on Victorian society.  The first few chapters of the novel dealing with the discovery of Erewhon are in fact based on Butler's own experiences in New Zealand where, as a young man, he worked as a sheep farmer on Mesopotamia Station for about four years (1860–64), and explored parts of the interior of the South Island and which he wrote about in his A First Year in Canterbury Settlement (1863). 

Ectopia (medicine)<====>9665<====>Ectopia (medicine)An ectopia ( ) is a displacement or malposition of an organ or other body part, which is then referred to as ectopic ( ). Most ectopias are congenital, but some may happen later in life.ExamplesEctopic ACTH syndrome, also known as small-cell carcinoma.Ectopic calcification, a pathologic deposition of calcium salts in tissues or bone growth in soft tissuesCerebellar tonsillar ectopia, aka Chiari malformation, a herniation of the brain through the foramen magnum, which may be congenital or caused by trauma. Ectopic cilia, a hair growing where it isn't supposed to be, commonly an eyelash on an abnormal spot on the eyelid, distichiaEctopia cordis, the displacement of the heart outside the body during fetal development Ectopic enamel, a tooth abnormality, where enamel is found in an unusual location, such as at the root of a toothEctopic expression, the expression of a gene in an abnormal place in an organismEctopic hormone, a hormone produced by a tumor, such as small-cell carcinoma, can cause Cushing's syndrome Ectopia lentis, the displacement of the crystalline lens of the eyeNeuronal ectopiaEctopic pancreas, displacement of pancreatic tissue in the body with no connection, anatomical or vascular, to the pancreasEctopic recombination, the recombination between sequences (like leu2 sequences) present at different genomic locationsRenal ectopia occurs when both kidneys are on the same side of the bodyEctopic testis, a testis that has moved to an unusual locationEctopic thymus,  where thymus tissue is found in an abnormal locationEctopic thyroid, where an entire or parts of the thyroid are located elsewhere in the bodyEctopic toothEctopic ureter, where the ureter terminates somewhere other than the urinary bladderEctopia vesicae,  a congenital anomality in which part of the urinary bladder is present outside the bodySee alsoEctopic beat of the heartCervical ectropionEctopic pregnancy, where the fertilized egg implants anywhere other than the uterine wallHeterotopia (medicine)

Entorhinal cortex<====>9667<====>Entorhinal cortex The entorhinal cortex (EC) (ento = interior, rhino = nose, entorhinal = interior to the rhinal sulcus) is an area of the brain located in the medial temporal lobe and functioning as a hub in a widespread network for memory and navigation.  The EC is the main interface between the hippocampus and neocortex.  The EC-hippocampus system plays an important role in declarative (autobiographical/episodic/semantic) memories and in particular spatial memories including memory formation, memory consolidation, and memory optimization in sleep.  The EC is also responsible for the pre-processing (familiarity) of the input signals in the reflex nictitating membrane response of classical trace conditioning, the association of impulses from the eye and the ear occurs in the entorhinal cortex. 

Ernst Haeckel<====>9668<====>Ernst Haeckel    Ernst Heinrich Philipp August Haeckel ( ; 16 February 1834 – 9 August 1919 ) was a German biologist, naturalist, philosopher, physician, professor, marine biologist, and artist who discovered, described and named thousands of new species, mapped a genealogical tree relating all life forms, and coined many terms in biology, including anthropogeny, ecology, phylum, phylogeny,  stem cell, and Protista.  Haeckel promoted and popularised Charles Darwin's work in Germany and developed the influential but no longer widely held recapitulation theory ("ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny") claiming that an individual organism's biological development, or ontogeny, parallels and summarises its species' evolutionary development, or phylogeny. 

Evolutionism<====>9670<====>EvolutionismEvolutionism was a common 19th century belief that organisms inherently improve themselves through progressive inherited change over time (orthogenesis), and increase in complexity through evolution.    The belief went on to include cultural evolution and social evolution.In the 1970s the term Neo-Evolutionism was used to describe the idea "that human beings sought to preserve a familiar style of life unless change was forced on them by factors that were beyond their control".  The term is sometimes also colloquially used to refer to the modern synthesis, a scientific theory that describes how biological evolution occurs through natural selection and Mendelian genetics. 

Entscheidungsproblem<====>9672<====>Entscheidungsproblem  In mathematics and computer science, the   ( , German for "decision problem") is a challenge posed by David Hilbert in 1928.   The problem asks for an algorithm that takes as input a statement of a first-order logic (possibly with a finite number of axioms beyond the usual axioms of first-order logic) and answers "Yes" or "No" according to whether the statement is universally valid, i. e. , valid in every structure satisfying the axioms.  By the completeness theorem of first-order logic, a statement is universally valid if and only if it can be deduced from the axioms, so the   can also be viewed as asking for an algorithm to decide whether a given statement is provable from the axioms using the rules of logic. 

Einhard<====>9674<====>EinhardEinhard (also Eginhard or Einhart;  ;   775 – March 14, 840 AD) was a Frankish scholar and courtier.  Einhard was a dedicated servant of Charlemagne and his son Louis the Pious; his main work is a biography of Charlemagne, the Vita Karoli Magni, "one of the most precious literary bequests of the early Middle Ages. " Public lifeEinhard was from the eastern German-speaking part of the Frankish Kingdom.  Born into a family of  landowners of some importance, his parents sent him to be educated by the monks of Fulda - one of the most impressive centres of learning in the Frank lands - perhaps due to his small stature which restricted his riding and sword-fighting ability, Einhard concentrated his energies towards scholarship and especially to the mastering of Latin. 

Ester<====>9675<====>Ester In chemistry, an ester is a chemical compound derived from an acid (organic or inorganic) in which at least one –OH (hydroxyl) group is replaced by an –O–alkyl (alkoxy) group.    Usually, esters are derived from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol.   Glycerides, which are fatty acid esters of glycerol, are important esters in biology, being one of the main classes of lipids, and making up the bulk of animal fats and vegetable oils.  Esters with low molecular weight are commonly used as fragrances and found in essential oils and pheromones.  Phosphoesters form the backbone of DNA molecules. 

Endosymbiont<====>9677<====>EndosymbiontAn endosymbiont or endobiont    is any organism that lives to mutual benefit within the body or cells of another organism, i. e.  in an endosymbiosis (Greek: ἔνδον endon "within", σύν syn "together" and βίωσις biosis "living").   Examples are nitrogen-fixing bacteria (called rhizobia), which live in root nodules on legume roots, single-cell algae inside reef-building corals, and bacterial endosymbionts that provide essential nutrients to about 10–15% of insects. Many instances of endosymbiosis are obligate; that is, either the endosymbiont or the host cannot survive without the other, such as the gutless marine worms of the genus Riftia, which get nutrition from their endosymbiotic bacteria. 

Exponential function<====>9678<====>Exponential function In mathematics, an exponential function is a function of the form in which the input variable   occurs as an exponent.   A function of the form  f(x)=b^{x+c} , where  c  is a constant, is also considered an exponential function and can be rewritten as  f(x)=ab^x , with  a=b^c .  As functions of a real variable, exponential functions are uniquely characterized by the fact that the growth rate of such a function (i. e. , its derivative) is directly proportional to the value of the function.   The constant of proportionality of this relationship is the natural logarithm of the base  b : The constant e ≈ 2. 

Prince Eugene of Savoy<====>9679<====>Prince Eugene of Savoy  Prince Eugene of Savoy (French: François-Eugène de Savoie, Italian: Principe Eugenio di Savoia-Carignano, German: Prinz Eugen von Savoyen; 18 October 1663 – 21 April 1736) was a general of the Imperial Army and statesman of the Holy Roman Empire and the Archduchy of Austria and one of the most successful military commanders in modern European history, rising to the highest offices of state at the Imperial court in Vienna. Born in Paris, Eugene grew up around the French court of King Louis XIV.  Based on his poor physique and bearing, the Prince was initially prepared for a career in the church, but by the age of 19 he had determined on a military career. 

Emanuel Leutze<====>9683<====>Emanuel Leutze Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze (May 24, 1816 July 18, 1868) was a German American history painter best known for his painting Washington Crossing the Delaware.  He is associated with the Düsseldorf school of painting. BiographyPhiladelphiaLeutze was born in Schwäbisch Gmünd, Württemberg, Germany, and was brought to the United States as a child.   His parents settled first in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and then at Philadelphia.   His early education was good, though not especially in the direction of art.  The first development of his artistic talent occurred while he was attending the sickbed of his father, when he attempted drawing to occupy the long hours of waiting. 

Erasmus Alberus<====>9684<====>Erasmus Alberus Erasmus Alberus (c.  1500 – 5 May 1553) was a German humanist, Lutheran reformer, and poet. LifeHe was born in the village of Bruchenbrücken (now part of Friedberg, Hesse) about the year 1500.  Although his father Tilemann Alber was a schoolmaster, his early education was neglected.   Ultimately in 1518 he found his way to the University of Wittenberg, where he studied theology.  He had the good fortune to attract the attention of Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon, and subsequently became one of Luther's most active helpers in the Protestant Reformation.  Not only did he fight for the Protestant cause as a preacher and theologian, but he was almost the only member of Luther's party who was able to confront the Roman Catholics with the weapon of literary satire. 

Earley parser<====>9685<====>Earley parserIn computer science, the Earley parser is an algorithm for parsing strings that belong to a given context-free language, though (depending on the variant) it may suffer problems with certain nullable grammars.   The algorithm, named after its inventor, Jay Earley, is a chart parser that uses dynamic programming; it is mainly used for parsing in computational linguistics.  It was first introduced in his dissertation    in 1968 (and later appeared in abbreviated, more legible form in a journal   ). Earley parsers are appealing because they can parse all context-free languages, unlike LR parsers and LL parsers, which are more typically used in compilers but which can only handle restricted classes of languages. 

Ethiopian cuisine<====>9686<====>Ethiopian cuisine Ethiopian cuisine ( ) characteristically consists of vegetable and often very spicy meat dishes.  This is usually in the form of wat, a thick stew, served atop injera, a large sourdough flatbread, Javins, Marie.  "Eating and Drinking in Ethiopia. "   Gonomad. com.  Accessed July 2011.   which is about   in diameter and made out of fermented teff flour.   Ethiopians eat exclusively with their right hands, using pieces of injera to pick up bites of entrées and side dishes.   Utensils are optional. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church prescribes a number of fasting (tsom,  ) periods, including Wednesdays, Fridays, and the entire Lenten season, so Ethiopian cuisine contains many dishes that are vegan. 

Epistle of James<====>9688<====>Epistle of James   The Epistle of James ( ), the Book of James, or simply James, is one of the twenty-one epistles (didactic letters) in the New Testament. The author identifies himself as "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ," who is writing to "the twelve tribes scattered abroad" (James 1:1).  The epistle is traditionally attributed to James the brother of Jesus (James the Just),   and the audience is generally considered to be Jewish Christians, who were dispersed outside Palestine due to persecution.    Framed within an overall theme of patient perseverance during trials and temptations, James writes to encourage believers to live consistently with what they have learned in Christ. 

Epistle of Jude<====>9689<====>Epistle of Jude  The Epistle of Jude, often shortened to Jude, is the next-to-last book of the New Testament and is traditionally attributed to Jude, the servant of Jesus and the brother of James the Just. CompositionThe letter of Jude was one of the disputed books of the Canon.    The links between the Epistle and 2 Peter, its use of the Apocryphal Books, and its brevity raised concern.   It is one of the shortest books in the Bible, being only 25 verses long. ContentJude urges his readers to defend the deposit of Christ's doctrine that had been closed by the time he wrote his epistle, and to remember the words of the apostles spoken somewhat before. 

Eusebius Amort<====>9692<====>Eusebius AmortEusebius Amort (November 15, 1692 – February 5, 1775) was a German Roman Catholic theologian. LifeAmort was born at Bibermuhle, near Tolz, in Upper Bavaria.   He studied at Munich, and at an early age joined the Canons Regular at Polling, where, shortly after his ordination in 1717, he taught theology and philosophy.  The Parnassus Boicus learned society was based on a plan started in 1720 by three Augustinian fathers: Eusebius Amort, Gelasius Hieber (1671-1731), a famous preacher in the German language and Agnellus Kandler (1692-1745), a genealogist and librarian.  The initial plans fell through, but in 1722 they issued the first volume of the Parnassus Boicus journal, communicating interesting information from the arts and sciences. 

Episcopi vagantes<====>9693<====>Episcopi vagantes(singular:  , Latin for wandering bishops or stray bishops) are those persons consecrated, in a "clandestine or irregular way," as Christian bishops outside the structures and canon law of the established churches; those regularly consecrated but later excommunicated, and not in communion with any generally recognized diocese; and those who have in communion with them small groups that appear to exist solely for the bishop's sake.  David V.  Barrett, in the Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements, specifies that now   are "those independent bishops who collect several different lines of transmission of apostolic succession, and who will happily (and sometimes for a fee) consecrate anyone who requests it. 

Elizabeth Garrett Anderson<====>9695<====>Elizabeth Garrett Anderson   Elizabeth Garrett Anderson (9 June 1836 – 17 December 1917) was an English physician and suffragist, and the first woman to qualify in Britain as a physician and surgeon.   She was the co-founder of the first hospital staffed by women, the first dean of a British medical school, the first female doctor of medicine in France, the first woman in Britain to be elected to a school board and, as Mayor of Aldeburgh, the first female mayor and magistrate in Britain. Early lifeElizabeth Garrett was born on 9 June 1836 in Whitechapel, London, the second of eleven children of Newson Garrett (1812–1893), from Leiston, Suffolk, and his wife, Louisa   Dunnell (1813–1903), from London. 

Erosion<====>9696<====>Erosion In earth science, erosion is the action of surface processes (such as water flow or wind) that removes soil, rock, or dissolved material from one location on the Earth's crust, and then transport it away to another location    (not to be confused with weathering which involves no movement).  The particulate breakdown of rock or soil into clastic sediment is referred to as physical or mechanical erosion; this contrasts with chemical erosion, where soil or rock material is removed from an area by its dissolving into a solvent (typically water), followed by the flow away of that solution. 

Euclidean space<====>9697<====>Euclidean space  In geometry, Euclidean space encompasses the two-dimensional Euclidean plane, the three-dimensional space of Euclidean geometry, and certain other spaces.  It is named after the Ancient Greek mathematician Euclid of Alexandria.   The term "Euclidean" distinguishes these spaces from other types of spaces considered in modern geometry.  Euclidean spaces also generalize to higher dimensions. Classical Greek geometry defined the Euclidean plane and Euclidean three-dimensional space using certain postulates, while the other properties of these spaces were deduced as theorems.  Geometric constructions are also used to define rational numbers.  When algebra and mathematical analysis became developed enough, this relation reversed and now it is more common to define Euclidean space using Cartesian coordinates and the ideas of analytic geometry. 

Edwin Austin Abbey<====>9700<====>Edwin Austin Abbey  Edwin Austin Abbey   (April 1, 1852 – August 1, 1911) was an American muralist, illustrator, and painter.  He flourished at the beginning of what is now referred to as the "golden age" of illustration, and is best known for his drawings and paintings of Shakespearean and Victorian subjects, as well as for his painting of Edward VII's coronation.His most famous set of murals, The Quest of the Holy Grail, adorns the Boston Public Library. BiographyAbbey was born in Philadelphia in 1852.  He studied art at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts  under Christian Schuessele. 

Evolutionary psychology<====>9703<====>Evolutionary psychology   Evolutionary psychology is a theoretical approach in the social and natural sciences that examines psychological structure from a modern evolutionary perspective.  It seeks to identify which human psychological traits are evolved adaptations – that is, the functional products of natural selection or sexual selection in human evolution.  Adaptationist thinking about physiological mechanisms, such as the heart, lungs, and immune system, is common in evolutionary biology.  Some evolutionary psychologists apply the same thinking to psychology, arguing that the modularity of mind is similar to that of the body and with different modular adaptations serving different functions. 

Languages of Europe<====>9705<====>Languages of Europe   Most languages of Europe belong to the Indo-European language family.  Out of a total population of 740 million (as of 2010), some 94% are native speakers of an Indo-European language;within Indo-European, the three largest phyla are Slavic, Germanic and Romance, with more than 200 million speakers each, between them accounting for close to 90% of Europeans.  Smaller phyla of Indo-European found in Europe include Hellenic (Greek, c.  10 million), Baltic (c.  7 million), Albanian (c.  5 million), Indo-Aryan (Romani, c.  1. 5 million) and Celtic (c.  1 million).

Electronegativity<====>9707<====>Electronegativity Electronegativity, symbol  χ , is a chemical property that describes the tendency of an atom to attract a shared pair of electrons (or electron density) towards itself.An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and the distance at which its valence electrons reside from the charged nucleus.  The higher the associated electronegativity number, the more an element or compound attracts electrons towards it. The term "electronegativity" was introduced by Jöns Jacob Berzelius in 1811,   though the concept was known even before that and was studied by many chemists including Avogadro. 

European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages<====>9708<====>European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages  The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (ECRML) is a European treaty (CETS 148) adopted in 1992  under the auspices of the Council of Europe to protect and promote historical regional and minority languages in Europe.  The preparation for the charter was undertaken by the predecessor to the current Congress of Local and Regional Authorities, the Standing Conference of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe because involvement of local and regional government was essential.  The actual charter was written in the Parliamentary Assembly based on the Congress' Recommendations. 

English Civil War<====>9709<====>English Civil War    The English Civil War (1642–1651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians ("Roundheads") and Royalists ("Cavaliers") over, principally, the manner of England's government.  The first (1642–1646) and second (1648–1649) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third (1649–1651) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament.  The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. The overall outcome of the war was threefold: the trial and execution of Charles I (1649); the exile of his son, Charles II (1651); and the replacement of English monarchy with, at first, the Commonwealth of England (1649–1653) and then the Protectorate under the personal rule of Oliver Cromwell (1653–1658) and subsequently his son Richard (1658–1659). 

Elementary algebra<====>9710<====>Elementary algebra Elementary algebra encompasses some of the basic concepts of algebra, one of the main branches of mathematics.  It is typically taught to secondary school students and builds on their understanding of arithmetic.  Whereas arithmetic deals with specified numbers,  algebra introduces quantities without fixed values, known as variables.   This use of variables entails a use of algebraic notation and an understanding of the general rules of the operators introduced in arithmetic.   Unlike abstract algebra, elementary algebra is not concerned with algebraic structures outside the realm of real and complex numbers. The use of variables to denote quantities allows general relationships between quantities to be formally and concisely expressed, and thus enables solving a broader scope of problems.

Excalibur<====>9717<====>Excalibur  Excalibur, or Caliburn, is the legendary sword of King Arthur, sometimes also attributed with magical powers or associated with the rightful sovereignty of Great Britain.  Sometimes Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone (the proof of Arthur's lineage) are said to be the same weapon, but in most versions they are considered separate.  Excalibur was associated with the Arthurian legend very early.  In Welsh, it is  called Caledfwlch; in Cornish, Calesvol; in Breton, Kaledvoulc'h; and in Latin, Caliburnus. Forms and etymologiesThe name Excalibur ultimately derives from the Welsh Caledfwlch (and Breton Kaledvoulc'h, Middle Cornish Calesvol) which is a compound of   "hard" and    "breach, cleft".

Ecuador–United States relations<====>9725<====>Ecuador–United States relations  The Republic of Ecuador and the United States of America maintained close ties based on mutual interests in maintaining democratic institutions; combating cannabis  and cocaine; building trade, investment, and financial ties; cooperating in fostering Ecuador's economic development; and participating in inter-American organizations.  Ties are further strengthened by the presence of an estimated 150,000-200,000 Ecuadorians living in the United States and by 24,000 U. S.  citizens visiting Ecuador annually, and by approximately 15,000 U. S.  citizens residing in Ecuador.   The United States assists Ecuador's economic development directly through the Agency for International Development (USAID) program in Ecuador and through multilateral organizations such as the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank. 

Eight-ball<====>9727<====>Eight-ball  Eight-ball (often spelled 8-ball or eightball, and sometimes called solids and stripes, spots and stripes in the UK  or, more rarely, bigs and littles/smalls, and highs and lows) is a pool (pocket billiards) game popular in much of the world, and the subject of international professional and amateur competition.  Played on a pool table with six pockets, the game is so universally known in some countries that beginners are often unaware of other pool games and believe the word "pool" itself refers to eight-ball .  The game has numerous variations, mostly regional.  Standard eight-ball is the second most competitive professional pool game, after nine-ball, and for the last several decades ahead of straight pool . 

Earned value management<====>9728<====>Earned value management Earned value management (EVM), or Earned Value Project/Performance Management (EVPM) is a project management technique for measuring project performance and progress in an objective manner. OverviewEarned value management is a project management technique for measuring project performance and progress.  It has the ability to combine measurements of the project management triangle:ScopeTimeCostsIn a single integrated system, Earned Value Management is able to provide accurate forecasts of project performance problems, which is an important contribution for project management. Early EVM research showed that the areas of planning and control are significantly impacted by its use; and similarly, using the methodology improves both scope definition as well as the analysis of overall project performance. 

Electron microscope<====>9730<====>Electron microscopeAn electron microscope is a microscope that uses a beam of accelerated electrons as a source of illumination.  As the wavelength of an electron can be up to 100,000 times shorter than that of visible light photons, electron microscopes have a higher resolving power than light microscopes and can reveal the structure of smaller objects.  A scanning transmission electron microscope has achieved better than 50 pm resolution in annular dark-field imaging mode    and magnifications of up to about 10,000,000x whereas most light microscopes are limited by diffraction to about 200 nm resolution and useful magnifications below 2000x. 

List of recently extinct bird species<====>9731<====>List of recently extinct bird speciesThis page refers only to birds that have gone extinct since the year 1500 and usually were subject to scientific study while alive. For a list of early taxa of birds known only from fossils, see List of fossil birds.  For birds extinct in Late Quaternary prehistoric times and usually known from specimens not completely fossilized, see Late Quaternary prehistoric birds. Since 1500, over 190 species of birds have become extinct, and this rate of extinction seems to be increasing.  The situation is exemplified by Hawaii, where 30% of all known recently extinct bird taxa originally lived. 

Eli Whitney<====>9732<====>Eli Whitney    Eli Whitney (December 8, 1765 – January 8, 1825) was an American inventor best known for inventing the cotton gin.   This was one of the key inventions of the Industrial Revolution and shaped the economy of the Antebellum South.Whitney's invention made upland short cotton into a profitable crop, which strengthened the economic foundation of slavery in the United States.  Despite the social and economic impact of his invention, Whitney lost many profits in legal battles over patent infringement for the cotton gin.  Thereafter, he turned his attention into securing contracts with the government in the manufacture of muskets for the newly formed United States Army. 

The American Prisoner<====>9734<====>The American Prisoner   The American Prisoner is a British novel written by Eden Phillpotts and published in 1904    and adapted into a film by the same name in 1929.   The story concerns an English woman who lives at Fox Tor farm, and an American captured during the American Revolutionary War and held at the prison at Princetown on Dartmoor. The heroine's father, Maurice Malherb, is based on Thomas Windeatt. In the novel Malherb is a miscreant who destroys Childe's tomb and beats his servant.   He is depicted as a victim of his own bad temper rather than a sadist. 

Electromagnetic field<====>9735<====>Electromagnetic field  An electromagnetic field (also EMF or EM field) is a physical field produced by electrically charged objects.   It affects the behavior of charged objects in the vicinity of the field.  The electromagnetic field extends indefinitely throughout space and describes the electromagnetic interaction.  It is one of the four fundamental forces of nature (the others are gravitation, weak interaction and strong interaction). The field can be viewed as the combination of an electric field and a magnetic field.  The electric field is produced by stationary charges, and the magnetic field by moving charges (currents); these two are often described as the sources of the field. 

Empire State Building<====>9736<====>Empire State Building The Empire State Building is a 102-story  Art Deco skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.  Designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon and completed in 1931, the building has a roof height of   and stands a total of   tall, including its antenna.  Its name is derived from "Empire State", the nickname of New York.    the building is the 5th-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States and the 28th-tallest in the world.  It is also the 6th-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas. 

Eugenics<====>9737<====>Eugenics   Eugenics ( ; from Greek εὐγενής eugenes 'well-born' from εὖ eu, 'good, well' and γένος genos, 'race, stock, kin')   is a set of beliefs and practices that aims at improving the genetic quality of a human population.The exact definition of eugenics has been a matter of debate since the term was coined by Francis Galton in 1883.   The concept predates this coinage, with Plato suggesting applying the principles of selective breeding to humans around 400 BCE. Frederick Osborn's 1937 journal article "Development of a Eugenic Philosophy"    framed it as a social philosophy—that is, a philosophy with implications for social order. 

Email<====>9738<====>Email   Electronic Mail (email or e-mail) is a method of exchanging messages between people using electronic devices.  Email first entered limited use in the 1960s and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email.  Email operates across computer networks, which today is primarily the Internet.  Some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be online at the same time, in common with instant messaging.  Today's email systems are based on a store-and-forward model.  Email servers accept, forward, deliver, and store messages.  Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need to connect only briefly, typically to a mail server or a webmail interface, for as long as it takes to send or receive messages. 

Emoticon<====>9739<====>Emoticon  An emoticon ( ,  , rarely pronounced  )is a pictorial representation of a facial expression using ASCII characters, usually punctuation marks, numbers and letters, to express a person's feelings or mood.  The first ASCII emoticons,  :-)  and  :-( , were written by Scott Fahlman in 1982, but emoticons actually originated on the PLATO IV computer system in 1972.  In Western countries, emoticons are usually written at a right angle to the direction of the text.  Users from Japan popularized a kind of emoticon called kaomoji (顔文字; lit. 

Erdős number<====>9742<====>Erdős numberThe Erdős number ( ) describes the "collaborative distance" between mathematician   and another person, as measured by authorship of mathematical papers. The same principle has been applied in other fields where a particular individual has collaborated with a large and broad number of peers.  The American Mathematical Society provides a free online tool to determine the Erdős number of every mathematical author listed in the Mathematical Reviews catalogue.    OverviewPaul Erdős (1913–1996) was an influential Hungarian mathematician who in the latter part of his life spent a great deal of time writing papers with a large number of colleagues, working on solutions to outstanding mathematical problems. 

School voucher<====>9750<====>School voucher  A school voucher, also called an education voucher, in a voucher system, is a certificate of government funding for a student at a school chosen by the student or the student's parents.  The funding is usually for a particular year, term or semester.  In some countries, states or local jurisdictions, the voucher can be used to cover or reimburse home schooling expenses.  In some countries, vouchers only exist for tuition at private schools.  According to a 2017 review of the economics literature on school vouchers, "the evidence to date is not sufficient to warrant recommending that vouchers be adopted on a widespread basis; however, multiple positive findings support continued exploration. 

E. B. White<====>9751<====>E.  B.  White  Elwyn Brooks "E.  B. " White (July 11, 1899 – October 1, 1985)  was an American writer and a world federalist .  For more than fifty years, he was a contributor to The New Yorker magazine.  He was also a co-author of the English language style guide The Elements of Style, which is commonly known as Strunk & White.  In addition, he wrote books for children, including Stuart Little (c.  1945), Charlotte's Web (c.  1952), and The Trumpet of the Swan (c.  1970).  In a 2012 survey of School Library Journal readers, Charlotte's Web was voted the top children's novel. 

Evangelist (Latter Day Saints)<====>9752<====>Evangelist (Latter Day Saints)In the Latter Day Saint movement, an evangelist is an ordained office of the ministry.  In some denominations of the movement, an evangelist is referred to as a patriarch.  However, the latter term was deprecated by the Community of Christ after the church began ordaining women to the priesthood.  Other denominations, such as The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite), have an evangelist position independent of the original "patriarch" office instituted movement founder Joseph Smith. Early Latter Day Saint movementThe first use of the term "evangelist" in Latter Day Saint theology were mainly consistent with how the term is used by Protestants and Catholics. 

Elegiac couplet<====>9755<====>Elegiac coupletThe elegiac couplet is a poetic form used by Greek lyric poets for a variety of themes usually of smaller scale than the epic.   Roman poets, particularly Propertius, Tibullus  and Ovid, adopted the same form in Latin many years later.   As with the English heroic, each couplet usually makes sense on its own, while forming part of a larger work. Each couplet consists of a hexameter verse followed by a pentameter verse.  The following is a graphic representation of its scansion.   Note that - is a long syllable, u a short syllable, and U is either one long syllable or two short syllables:- U | - U | - U | - U | - u u | - -- U | - U | - || - u u | - u u | -The form was felt by the ancients to contrast the rising action of the first verse with a falling quality in the second. 

Exabyte<====>9756<====>Exabyte  The exabyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information.  In the International System of Units (SI), the prefix exa indicates multiplication by the sixth power of 1000 (10 18 ).   Therefore, one exabyte is one quintillion bytes (short scale).  The symbol for the exabyte is EB. 1 EB =   =   =   = 1000 petabytes =   =  . A related unit, the exbibyte, using a binary prefix, is equal to   (= , about 15% larger. One thousand exabytes (1000 EB) is equal to one zettabyte (1 ZB). 

Era<====>9758<====>Era  An era is a span of time defined for the purposes of chronology or historiography, as in the regnal eras in the history of a given monarchy, a calendar era used for a given calendar, or the geological eras defined for the history of Earth. Comparable terms are epoch, age, period, saeculum, aeon (Greek aion) and   Sanskrit yuga. Etymology The word has been in use in English since 1615, and is derived from Late Latin aera "an era or epoch from which time is reckoned," probably identical to Latin æra "counters used for calculation," plural of æs "brass, money". 

Eschatology<====>9760<====>Eschatology   Eschatology   is a part of theology concerned with the final events of history, or the ultimate destiny of humanity.  This concept is commonly referred to as the "end of the world" or "end times".  The word arises from the Greek   eschatos meaning "last" and -logy meaning "the study of", first used in English around 1844.   The Oxford English Dictionary defines eschatology as "the part of theology concerned with death, judgment, and the final destiny of the soul and of humankind".  In the context of mysticism, the phrase refers metaphorically to the end of ordinary reality and reunion with the Divine. 

Ecumenical council<====>9762<====>Ecumenical council    An ecumenical council (or oecumenical council; also general council)  is a conference of ecclesiastical dignitaries and theological experts convened to discuss and settle matters of Church doctrine and practice in which those entitled to vote are convoked from the whole world (oikoumene) and which secures the approbation of the whole Church.  The word "ecumenical" derives from the Late Latin oecumenicus "general, universal", from Greek oikoumenikos "from the whole world", from he oikoumene ge "the inhabited world (as known to the ancient Greeks); the Greeks and their neighbors considered as developed human society (as opposed to barbarian lands)", in later use "the Roman world" and in the Christian sense in ecclesiastical Greek, from oikoumenos, present passive participle of oikein "inhabit", from oikos "house, habitation. 

Exoplanet<====>9763<====>Exoplanet   An exoplanet ( ,  )  or extrasolar planet is a planet outside our solar system that orbits a star.  The first evidence of an exoplanet was noted as early as 1917, but was not recognized as such.   However, the first scientific detection of an exoplanet was in 1988.  Shortly afterwards, the first confirmed detection was in 1992.   HARPS (since 2004) has discovered about a hundred exoplanets while the Kepler space telescope (since 2009) has found more than two thousand.   Kepler has also detected a few thousand  candidate planets,of which about 11% may be false positives. 

Emma Goldman<====>9764<====>Emma Goldman    Emma Goldman ( , 1869 May 14, 1940) was an anarchist political activist and writer.  She played a pivotal role in the development of anarchist political philosophy in North America and Europe in the first half of the 20th century. Born in Kovno, Russian Empire (now Kaunas, Lithuania) to a Jewish family, Goldman emigrated to the United States in 1885.  University of Illinois at Chicago Biography of Emma Goldman  .  UIC Library Emma Goldman Collection.  Retrieved on December 13, 2008.   Attracted to anarchism after the Haymarket affair, Goldman became a writer and a renowned lecturer on anarchist philosophy, women's rights, and social issues, attracting crowds of thousands. 

Equuleus<====>9765<====>Equuleus Equuleus   is a constellation.  Its name is Latin for 'little horse', a foal.  It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations.  It is the second smallest of the modern constellations (after Crux), spanning only 72 square degrees.  It is also very faint, having no stars brighter than the fourth magnitude. Notable featuresStars The brightest star in Equuleus is Alpha Equulei, traditionally called Kitalpha, a yellow star magnitude 3. 9, 186 light-years from Earth.  Its traditional name means "the section of the horse".

Eucharist<====>9767<====>Eucharist   The Eucharist ( ; also called Holy Communion or the Lord's Supper,  among other names) is a Christian rite that is considered a sacrament in most churches and an ordinance in others.  According to the New Testament, the rite was instituted by Jesus Christ during his Last Supper; giving his disciples bread and wine during the Passover meal, Jesus commanded his followers to "do this in memory of me" while referring to the bread as "my body" and the wine as "my blood".Through the Eucharistic celebration Christians  remember Christ's sacrifice of himself on the cross. 

Eclipse<====>9770<====>Eclipse An eclipse is an astronomical event that occurs when an astronomical object is temporarily obscured, either by passing into the shadow of another body or by having another body pass between it and the viewer.  This alignment of three celestial objects is known as a syzygy.   Apart from syzygy, the term eclipse is also used when a spacecraft reaches a position where it can observe two celestial bodies so aligned.  An eclipse is the result of either an occultation (completely hidden) or a transit (partially hidden). The term eclipse is most often used to describe either a solar eclipse, when the Moon's shadow crosses the Earth's surface, or a lunar eclipse, when the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow. 

Ed (text editor)<====>9771<====>Ed (text editor)    is a line editor for the Unix operating system.  It was one of the first parts of the Unix operating system that was developed, in August 1969.It remains part of the POSIX and Open Group standards for Unix-based operating systems,  alongside more sophisticated full-screen editors such as vi. History and influenceThe ed text editor was one of the first three key elements of the Unix operating system—assembler, editor, and shell—developed by Ken Thompson in August 1969 on a PDP-7 at AT&T Bell Labs.    Many features of ed came from the qed text editor developed at Thompson's alma mater University of California, Berkeley. 

Edlin<====>9772<====>Edlin  Edlin is a line editor, and the only text editor provided with early versions of MS-DOS.  Although superseded in MS-DOS 5. 0 and later by the full-screen edit command, and by Notepad in Microsoft Windows, it continues to be included in the 32-bit versions of current Microsoft operating systems. HistoryEdlin was created by Tim Paterson in two weeks in 1980, for Seattle Computer Products's 86-DOS (QDOS)  based on the CP/M line editor ED.  Microsoft acquired 86-DOS and sold it as MS-DOS, so Edlin was included in v1. 0–v5. 0 of MS-DOS, after which the only editor included was the new full-screen MS-DOS Editor in v6. 

EBCDIC<====>9773<====>EBCDICExtended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code  (EBCDIC   [1] ;  ) is an eight-bit character encoding used mainly on IBM mainframe and IBM midrange computer operating systems.  It descended from the code used with punched cards and the corresponding six bit binary-coded decimal code used with most of IBM's computer peripherals of the late 1950s and early 1960s.    It is supported by various non-IBM platforms, such as Fujitsu-Siemens' BS2000/OSD, OS-IV, MSP, and MSP-EX, the SDS Sigma series, and Unisys VS/9 and MCP. HistoryEBCDIC was devised in 1963 and 1964 by IBM and was announced with the release of the IBM System/360 line of mainframe computers. 

Endoplasmic reticulum<====>9775<====>Endoplasmic reticulum  The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a type of organelle found in eukaryotic cells that forms an interconnected network of flattened, membrane-enclosed sacs or tube-like structures known as cisternae.  The membranes of the ER are continuous with the outer nuclear membrane.  The endoplasmic reticulum occurs in most types of eukaryotic cells, but is absent from red blood cells and spermatozoa.  There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum: rough and smooth.  The outer (cytosolic) face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with ribosomes that are the sites of protein synthesis.  The rough endoplasmic reticulum is especially prominent in cells such as hepatocytes.

Electronic data interchange<====>9790<====>Electronic data interchange Electronic data interchange (EDI) is the concept of businesses communicating electronically certain information that was traditionally communicated on paper.   The two classic examples of such information are purchase orders and invoices.   Standards for EDI exist to facilitate parties transacting such instruments without having to make special arrangements. EDI has existed for more than 30 years, and there are many EDI standards (including X12, EDIFACT, ODETTE, etc. ), some of which address the needs of specific industries or regions.   It also refers specifically to a family of standards.   In 1996, the National Institute of Standards and Technology defined electronic data interchange as "the computer-to-computer interchange of strictly formatted messages that represent documents other than monetary instruments. 

Extravehicular activity<====>9792<====>Extravehicular activity Extravehicular activity (EVA) is any activity done by an astronaut or cosmonaut outside a spacecraft beyond the Earth's appreciable atmosphere.  The term most commonly applies to a spacewalk made outside a craft orbiting Earth (such as the International Space Station), but also has applied to lunar surface exploration (commonly known as moonwalks) performed by six pairs of American astronauts in the Apollo program from 1969 to 1972.  On each of the last three of these missions, astronauts also performed deep-space EVAs on the return to Earth, to retrieve film canisters from the outside of the spacecraft. 

Erin Brockovich<====>9799<====>Erin Brockovich  Erin Brockovich (born June 22, 1960) is an American legal clerk and environmental activist, who, despite her lack of formal education in the law, was instrumental in building a case against the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) of California in 1993.  Her successful lawsuit was the subject of a 2000 film, Erin Brockovich, which starred Julia Roberts.  Since then, Brockovich has become a media personality as well, hosting the TV series Challenge America with Erin Brockovich on ABC and Final Justice on Zone Reality.  She is the president of Brockovich Research & Consulting. 

Electric charge<====>9804<====>Electric charge  Electric charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field.  There are two types of electric charges: positive and negative (commonly carried by protons and electrons respectively).  Like charges repel and unlike attract.  An object with an absence of net charge is referred to as  .   The SI derived unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C).  In electrical engineering, it is also common to use the ampere-hour (Ah), and, in chemistry, it is common to use the elementary charge (e) as a unit. 

Ellis Island<====>9806<====>Ellis Island  Ellis Island, in Upper New York Bay, was the gateway for over 12 million immigrants to the U. S.  as the United States' busiest immigrant inspection station for over 60 years    from 1892 until 1954.  Ellis Island was opened January 1, 1892.   The island was greatly expanded with land reclamation between 1892 and 1934.  Before that, the much smaller original island was the site of Fort Gibson and later a naval magazine.  The island was made part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument in 1965 and has hosted a museum of immigration since 1990. 

Euripides<====>9808<====>Euripides   Euripides (  or  ;   ;  ) (c.  480 – c.  406 BC) was a tragedian of classical Athens.  Along with Aeschylus and Sophocles, he is one of the three ancient Greek tragedians for whom a significant number of plays have survived.  Some ancient scholars attributed 95 plays to him but according to the Suda it was 92 at most.  Of these, 18 or 19 have survived more or less complete (there has been debate about his authorship of Rhesus, largely on stylistic grounds)  and there are also fragments, some substantial, of most of the other plays.

Extinction event<====>9813<====>Extinction event An extinction event (also known as a mass extinction or biotic crisis) is a widespread and rapid decrease in the biodiversity on Earth.  Such an event is identified by a sharp change in the diversity and abundance of multicellular organisms.  It occurs when the rate of extinction increases with respect to the rate of speciation.  Because most diversity and biomass on Earth is microbial, and thus difficult to measure, recorded extinction events affect the easily observed, biologically complex component of the biosphere rather than the total diversity and abundance of life.  Extinction occurs at an uneven rate. 

E. E. Smith<====>9814<====>E.  E.  Smith    Edward Elmer Smith (also E.  E.  Smith, E.  E.  Smith, Ph. D. , E.  E.  "Doc" Smith, Doc Smith, "Skylark" Smith, or—to his family—Ted; May 2, 1890 – August 31, 1965) was an American food engineer (specializing in doughnut and pastry mixes) and an early science-fiction author, best known for the Lensman and Skylark series.  He is sometimes called the father of space opera. BiographyFamily and educationEdward Elmer Smith was born in Sheboygan, Wisconsin on May 2, 1890, to Fred Jay Smith and Caroline Mills Smith, both staunch Presbyterians of British ancestry. 

Évariste Galois<====>9815<====>Évariste Galois  Évariste Galois ( ; 25 October 1811 – 31 May 1832) was a French mathematician born in Bourg-la-Reine.  While still in his teens, he was able to determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals, thereby solving a problem standing for 350 years.  His work laid the foundations for Galois theory and group theory,    two major branches of abstract algebra, and the subfield of Galois connections.  He died at age 20 from wounds suffered in a duel.  LifeEarly lifeGalois was born on 25 October 1811 to Nicolas-Gabriel Galois and Adélaïde-Marie (born Demante). 

Ennius<====>9820<====>EnniusQuintus Ennius ( ; c.  239 – c.  169 BC) was a writer and poet who lived during the Roman Republic.  He is often considered the father of Roman poetry.  He was born in Rudiae,  formerly a small town located near modern Lecce in the heel of Italy (ancient Calabria), and could speak Oscan as well as Latin and Greek.  Although only fragments of his works survive, his influence in Latin literature was significant, particularly in his use of Greek literary models. BiographyVery little is reliably known about the life of Ennius.  His contemporaries hardly mentioned him and much that is related about him could have been embroidered from references to himself in his now fragmentary writings. 

Eris (mythology)<====>9823<====>Eris (mythology)Eris ( ;  , "Strife") is the Greek goddess of strife and discord.  Her name is the equivalent of Latin Discordia, which means "discord".  Eris' Greek opposite is Harmonia, whose Latin counterpart is Concordia.  Homer equated her with the war-goddess Enyo, whose Roman counterpart is Bellona.  The dwarf planet Eris is named after the goddess. EtymologyEris is of uncertain etymology; connections with the verb ὀρίνειν orinein, "to raise, stir, excite," and the proper name Ἐρινύες Erinyes have been suggested.  R.  S.  P.  Beekes rejects these derivations and suggested a Pre-Greek origin.

Ethnocentrism<====>9827<====>Ethnocentrism  Ethnocentrism is judging another culture solely by the values and standards of one's own culture.Ethnocentric individuals judge other groups relative to their own ethnic group or culture, especially with concern for language, behavior, customs, and religion.  These ethnic distinctions and subdivisions serve to define each ethnicity's unique cultural identity.    Ethnocentrism may be overt or subtle, and while it is considered a natural proclivity of human psychology in everyday life, it has developed a generally negative connotation.   In anthropology, cultural relativism is seen as an antithesis and an antonym to ethnocentrism. 

Execution unit<====>9828<====>Execution unit   In computer engineering, an execution unit (also called a functional unit) is a part of the central processing unit (CPU) that performs the operations and calculations as instructed by the computer program.  It may have its own internal control sequence unit, which is not to be confused with the CPU's main control unit, some registers, and other internal units such as an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), address generation unit (AGU), floating-point unit (FPU), load-store unit (LSU) or some smaller and more specific components.  It is common for modern CPUs to have multiple parallel execution units, referred to as superscalar designs.

All Council of Europe member states are party to the Convention and new members are expected to ratify the convention at the earliest opportunity. 

Eureka Rebellion<====>9833<====>Eureka Rebellion   The Eureka Rebellion was a rebellion in 1854, instigated by gold miners in Ballarat, Victoria, Australia, who revolted against the colonial authority of the United Kingdom.  The Battle of the Eureka Stockade, by which the rebellion is popularly known, was fought between miners and the colonial forces of Australia on the 3rd December 1854 at Eureka Lead and named for the stockade structure built by miners during the conflict.   The rebellion resulted in the deaths of at least 27 people, the majority of whom were rebels. The rebellion was the culmination of a period of civil disobedience in the Ballarat region during the Victorian gold rush with miners objecting to the expense of a miner's licence, taxation via the licence without representation, and the actions of the government, the police and military. 

Escape from New York<====>9835<====>Escape from New York  Escape from New York is a 1981 American dystopian science-fiction action film co-written, co-scored and directed by John Carpenter.  The film is set in what was near-future of 1997, in a crime-ridden United States that has converted Manhattan Island in New York City into the country's maximum security prison.  When Air Force One is hijacked by terrorists and crashes into New York City, ex-soldier and federal prisoner Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is given 24 hours to rescue the President of the United States. Carpenter wrote the film in the mid-1970s as a reaction to the Watergate scandal. 

Ethylene<====>9837<====>Ethylene Ethylene (IUPAC name: ethene) is a hydrocarbon which has the formula   or H 2 C=CH 2 .   It is a colorless flammable gas with a faint "sweet and musky" odour when pure.   It is the simplest alkene (a hydrocarbon with carbon-carbon double bonds). Ethylene is widely used in the chemical industry, and its worldwide production (over 150 million tonnes in 2016 ) exceeds that of any other organic compound.   Much of this production goes toward polyethylene, a widely used plastic containing polymer chains of ethylene units in various chain lengths. 

Eiffel (programming language)<====>9838<====>Eiffel (programming language)  Eiffel is an object-oriented programming language designed by Bertrand Meyer (an object-orientation proponent and author of Object-Oriented Software Construction) and Eiffel Software.  Meyer conceived the language in 1985 with the goal of increasing the reliability of commercial software development;  the first version becoming available in 1986.  In 2005, Eiffel became an ISO-standardized language. The design of the language is closely connected with the Eiffel programming method.  Both are based on a set of principles, including design by contract, command–query separation, the uniform-access principle, the single-choice principle, the open–closed principle, and option–operand separation. 

Ezra<====>9839<====>Ezra  Ezra ( ;  ,  ;  fl.  480–440 BCE), also called Ezra the Scribe ( ,  ) and Ezra the Priest in the Book of Ezra, was a Jewish scribe and a priest.

According to the Hebrew Bible he was a descendant of Seraiah ( )  the last High Priest to serve in the First Temple ( ), and a close relative of Joshua the first High Priest of the Second Temple (  CJB and similar translations only; see also  ). 

Elijah<====>9840<====>Elijah  Elijah ( , meaning "My God is Yahu/Jah"  ) or Elias ( ;    Elías;   Elyāe; Arabic: إلياس or إليا, Ilyās or Ilyā) was a prophet and a miracle worker who lived in the northern kingdom of Israel  during the reign of Ahab (9th century BC), according to the Books of Kings in the Hebrew Bible.  In 1 Kings 18, Elijah defended the worship of the Jewish God over that of the Canaanite deity Baal.  God also performed many miracles through Elijah, including resurrection (raising the dead), bringing fire down from the sky, and entering Heaven alive "by a whirlwind". 

Expressive aphasia<====>9841<====>Expressive aphasia  Expressive aphasia, also known as Broca's aphasia, is characterized by partial loss of the ability to produce language (spoken, manual,    or written), although comprehension generally remains intact.   A person with expressive aphasia will exhibit effortful speech.  Speech generally includes important content words, but leaves out function words that have only grammatical significance and not real-world meaning, such as prepositions and articles.This is known as "telegraphic speech".  The person's intended message may still be understood but his or her sentence will not be grammatically correct.  In very severe forms of expressive aphasia, a person may only speak using single word utterances. 

Ephesus<====>9843<====>Ephesus   Ephesus ( ;    Ephesos;  ; may ultimately derive from Hittite Apasa) was an ancient Greek city   on the coast of Ionia, three kilometres southwest of present-day Selçuk in İzmir Province, Turkey.  It was built in the 10th century BC on the site of the former Arzawan capital   by Attic and Ionian Greek colonists.  During the Classical Greek era it was one of the twelve cities of the Ionian League.  The city flourished after it came under the control of the Roman Republic in 129 BC. The city was famed for the nearby Temple of Artemis (completed around 550 BC), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. 

JavaScript<====>9845<====>JavaScript JavaScript (  ), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language.  Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production.  It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games.  The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine.  Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA. 

Exile<====>9855<====>Exile    To be in exile means to be away from one's home (i. e.  city, state, or country), while either being explicitly refused permission to return or being threatened with imprisonment or death upon return.  It can be a form of punishment and solitude.    It is common to distinguish between "internal exile", i. e. , forced resettlement within the country of residence, and "external exile", which is deportation outside the country of residence.   Although most commonly used to describe an individual situation, the term is also used for groups (especially ethnic or national groups), or for an entire government.

European Free Alliance<====>9864<====>European Free Alliance   The European Free Alliance (EFA) is a European political coalition that consists of various regionalist  political parties in Europe.  Members parties advocate either for full political independence and sovereignty, or some form of devolution or self-governance for their country or region.   The alliance has generally limited its membership to progressive parties;  therefore, only a fraction of European regionalist parties are members of the EFA. Since 1999 the EFA and the European Green Party (EGP) have joined forces within Greens–European Free Alliance (Greens/EFA) group in the European Parliament, albeit some EFA members have joined other groups from time to time.

Until 10 November 2012, the party was known as European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR).   The ALDE Party is affiliated with the Liberal International.  Having developed from a loose confederation of national political parties in the 1970s, the ALDE Party is a recognised European political party incorporated as a non-profit association under Belgian law. 

European People's Party group<====>9866<====>European People's Party group The European People's Party group (EPP Group) is the political group in the European Parliament consisting of deputies (MEPs) from the member parties of the European People's Party (EPP). In this respect, there is a distinction between the European People's Party itself (a European-level party of centre-right national political parties from across Europe) and the EPP Group in the European Parliament.  The EPP mostly comprises politicians of Christian democratic, conservative and liberal-conservative orientation.The European People's Party was officially founded as a European political party in 1976. 

European United Left–Nordic Green Left<====>9867<====>European United Left–Nordic Green Left European United Left–Nordic Green Left (Gauche unitaire européenne, GUE-NGL) is a left-wing political group in the European Parliament,    established in 1995.  The group comprises political parties of  socialist and communist orientation.

Exploit (computer security)<====>9875<====>Exploit (computer security)An exploit (from the English verb to exploit, meaning "to use something to one’s own advantage") is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic (usually computerized).  Such behavior frequently includes things like gaining control of a computer system, allowing privilege escalation, or a denial-of-service (DoS or related DDoS) attack. ClassificationThere are several methods of classifying exploits.  The most common is by how the exploit communicates to the vulnerable software. 

Erg<====>9877<====>Erg  The erg is a unit of energy and work equal to 10 −7  joules.  It originated in the centimetre–gram–second (CGS) system of units.  It has the symbol erg.  The erg is not an SI unit.  Its name is derived from ergon (’έργον) a Greek word meaning work or task.  An erg is the amount of work done by a force of one dyne exerted for a distance of one centimeter.  In the CGS base units, it is equal to one gram centimeter-squared per second-squared (g·cm 2 /s 2 ).  It is thus equal to 10 −7  joules or 100 nanojoules (nJ) in SI units. 

Everway<====>9878<====>Everway  Everway is a fantasy role-playing game   first published by Wizards of the Coast under their Alter Ego brand in the mid-1990s.  Its lead designer was Jonathan Tweet.   Marketed as a "Visionary Roleplaying Game", it has often been characterized as an innovative piece with a limited commercial success.  Wizards later abandoned the line, and Rubicon Games purchased it, and published several supplements.  The line was sold again to Gaslight Press in February 2001. The game has a fantasy setting of the multiverse type, with many different worlds, some of which differed from generic fantasy. 

Eurocard (printed circuit board)<====>9883<====>Eurocard (printed circuit board) Eurocard is a European standard format for PCB cards that can be plugged together into a standardized subrack.  The subrack consists of a series of slotted card guides on the top and bottom, into which the cards are slid so they stand on end, like books on a shelf.  At the "back" of each card is one or more connectors, which plug into mating connectors on a backplane that closes the rear of the subrack. DimensionsAs the cards are assumed to be installed in a vertical orientation, the usual meanings of height and width are transposed: A card might be 233. 

Electron counting<====>9890<====>Electron countingElectron counting is a formalism used for classifying compounds and for explaining or predicting electronic structure and bonding.    Many rules in chemistry rely on electron-counting:Octet rule is used with Lewis structures for main group elements, especially the lighter ones such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen,Eighteen-electron rule in inorganic chemistry and organometallic chemistry of transition metals,Polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory for cluster compounds, including transition metals and main group elements such as boron including Wade's rules for polyhedral cluster compounds, including transition metals and main group elements and mixtures thereof. Atoms that do not obey their rule are called "electron-deficient" when they have too few electrons to achieve a noble gas configuration, or "hypervalent" when they have too many electrons. 

Entropy<====>9891<====>Entropy In statistical mechanics, entropy (usual symbol  ) is related to the number of microscopic configurations   that a thermodynamic system can have when in a state as specified by some macroscopic variables.  Specifically, assuming for simplicity that each of the microscopic configurations is equally probable, the entropy of the system is the natural logarithm of that number of configurations, multiplied by the Boltzmann constant  .  Formally, S = k_{\mathrm{B}} \ln \Omega \text{ (assuming equiprobable states)}.  This is consistent with 19th-century formulas for entropy in terms of heat and temperature, as discussed below. 

Expert<====>9892<====>Expert  An expert is someone who has a prolonged or intense experience through practice and education in a particular field.  Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of   or skill whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by peers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain.  An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study.  Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. 

Economy of Afghanistan<====>9895<====>Economy of Afghanistan The economy of Afghanistan has had significant improvement in the last decade due to the infusion of billions of dollars in international assistance and remittances from Afghan expatriates.  The assistance that came from expatriates and outside investors saw this increase when there was more political reliability after the fall of  the Taliban regime. The nation's GDP stands at about $64. 08 billion with an exchange rate of $18. 4 billion (2014), and the GDP per capita is about $2,000.  It imports over $6 billion worth of goods but exports only $658 million, mainly fruits and nuts. 

Elf<====>9896<====>Elf An elf (plural: elves) is a type of human-shaped supernatural being in Germanic mythology and folklore.  In medieval Germanic-speaking cultures, elves seem generally to have been thought of as beings with magical powers and supernatural beauty, ambivalent towards everyday people and capable of either helping or hindering them.   However, the details of these beliefs have varied considerably over time and space, and have flourished in both pre-Christian and Christian cultures. The word elf is found throughout the Germanic languages and seems originally to have meant 'white being'.  Reconstructing the early concept of an elf depends largely on texts, written by Christians, in Old and Middle English, medieval German, and Old Norse. 

Evil<====>9897<====>Evil Evil, in a general context, is the absence or opposite of that which is described as being good.  Often, evil denotes profound immorality.In certain religious contexts, evil has been described as a supernatural force.   Definitions of evil vary, as does the analysis of its motives.   However, elements that are commonly associated with evil involve unbalanced behavior involving anger, revenge, fear, hatred, psychological trauma, expediency, selfishness, ignorance, or neglect.  In cultures with an Abrahamic religious influence, evil is usually perceived as the dualistic antagonistic opposite of good, in which good should prevail and evil should be defeated. 

Epistle to the Hebrews<====>9901<====>Epistle to the Hebrews  The Epistle to the Hebrews, or Letter to the Hebrews, or in the Greek manuscripts, simply To the Hebrews ( Πρὸς Έβραίους)  is one of the books of the New Testament. The text is traditionally attributed to  Paul the Apostle, but doubt on Pauline authorship is reported by Eusebius,  and modern biblical scholarship considers its authorship unknown,  perhaps written in deliberate imitation of the style of Paul.   Scholars of Greek consider its writing to be more polished and eloquent than any other book of the New Testament.  The book has earned the reputation of being a masterpiece. 

Esther<====>9902<====>Esther  Esther ( ;  ), born Hadassah ( ), is the eponymous heroine of the Book of Esther. According to the Hebrew Bible, Esther was a Jewish queen of the Persian king Ahasuerus.  Ahasuerus is traditionally identified with Xerxes I during the time of the Achaemenid Empire, although Josephus wrote that Esther's king husband was Xerxes' son Artaxerxes.   In his Historia Scholastica Petrus Comestor identified Ahasuerus (Esther 1:1) as Artaxerxes III who reconquered Egypt.   Her story is the basis for the celebration of Purim in Jewish tradition. In the Bible King Ahasuerus displayed his wealth for 180 days then held a 7 day feast in Susa (Shoushan). 

Entamoeba<====>9903<====>Entamoeba   Entamoeba is a genus of Amoebozoa found as internal parasites or commensals of animals. In 1875, Fedor Lösch described the first proven case of  amoebic dysentery in St.  Petersburg, Russia.  He referred to the amoeba he observed microscopically as 'Amoeba coli'; however it is not clear whether he was using this as a descriptive term or intended it as a formal taxonomic name.   The genus Entamoeba was defined by Casagrandi and Barbagallo for the species Entamoeba coli, which is known to be a commensal organism.   Lösch's organism was renamed Entamoeba histolytica by Fritz Schaudinn in 1903; he later died, in 1906, from a self-inflicted infection when studying this amoeba. 

England national football team<====>9904<====>England national football team    The England national football team represents England in international football and is controlled by The Football Association, the governing body for football in England.   England are one of the two oldest national teams in football; alongside Scotland, whom they played in the world's first international football match in 1872.  England's home ground is Wembley Stadium, London, and their headquarters is at St George's Park, Burton upon Trent.  The teams current manager is Gareth Southgate.  Although part of the United Kingdom, England has always had a representative side that plays in major professional tournaments, though not in the Olympic Games, as the IOC has always recognised United Kingdom representative sides. 

Eureka, Missouri<====>9907<====>Eureka, MissouriEureka is a city located in St.  Louis County, Missouri, United States between the cities of St.  Louis and Pacific along Interstate 44.  It is a portion of the Greater St.  Louis metro area.  As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 10,189.Since 1971, Eureka has been known as the home of the amusement park Six Flags St.  Louis. HistoryThe village of Eureka was platted in 1858  along the route of the Pacific Railroad.  By 1890, the village consisted of about 100 homes. 

Equation of state<====>9908<====>Equation of state In physics and thermodynamics, an equation of state is a thermodynamic equation relating state variables which describe the state of matter under a given set of physical conditions, such as pressure, volume, temperature (PVT), or internal energy.Equations of state are useful in describing the properties of fluids, mixtures of fluids, solids, and the interior of stars.  OverviewThe most prominent use of an equation of state is to correlate densities of gases and liquids to temperatures and pressures.  One of the simplest equations of state for this purpose is the ideal gas law, which is roughly accurate for weakly polar gases at low pressures and moderate temperatures. 

Ecclesiastes<====>9910<====>Ecclesiastes  Ecclesiastes  ( ; Greek: Ἐκκλησιαστής, Ekklēsiastēs,  , qōheleṯ) is one of 24 books of the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible, where it is classified as one of the Ketuvim (or "Writings").  Originally written c.  450-180 BCE, it is among the canonical Wisdom Books in the Old Testament of most denominations of Christianity.  The title Ecclesiastes is a Latin transliteration of the Greek translation of the Hebrew Kohelet (meaning "Gatherer", but traditionally translated as "Teacher" or "Preacher" ), the pseudonym used by the author of the book. The book is a musing by a King of Jerusalem as he relates his experiences and draws lessons from them, often self-critical. 

Ezekiel<====>9911<====>Ezekiel  Ezekiel ( ;  , Y'ḥezqel,  ) is the central protagonist of the Book of Ezekiel in the Hebrew Bible. In Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, Ezekiel is acknowledged as a Hebrew prophet.  In Judaism and Christianity, he is also viewed as the 6th-century BCE author of the Book of Ezekiel that reveals prophecies regarding the destruction of Jerusalem, the restoration to the land of Israel, and what some call the Millennial Temple visions, or the Third Temple. LifeThe author of the Book of Ezekiel presents himself as Ezekiel, the son of Buzzi, born into a priestly (Kohen) lineage. 

Executable and Linkable Format<====>9914<====>Executable and Linkable Format In computing, the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF, formerly named Extensible Linking Format), is a common standard file format for executable files, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps.  First published in the specification for the application binary interface (ABI) of the Unix operating system version named System V Release 4 (SVR4),  and later in the Tool Interface Standard, Tool Interface Standard (TIS) Executable and Linking Format (ELF) Specification Version 1. 2 (May 1995)  it was quickly accepted among different vendors of Unix systems.  In 1999, it was chosen as the standard binary file format for Unix and Unix-like systems on x86 processors by the 86open project.

Over 90 space missions have been launched since 1958, and it is still active.  Starting with Explorer 6, it has been operated by NASA, with regular collaboration with a variety of other institutions, including many international partners. HistoryThe Explorers program was the United States's first successful attempt to launch an artificial satellite.  It began as a U. S.  Army proposal (Project Orbiter) to place a scientific satellite into orbit during the International Geophysical Year; however, that proposal was rejected in favor of the U. 

Electronic oscillator<====>9920<====>Electronic oscillatorAn electronic oscillator is an electronic circuit that produces a periodic, oscillating electronic signal, often a sine wave or a square wave.    Oscillators convert direct current (DC) from a power supply to an alternating current (AC) signal.   They are widely used in many electronic devices.   Common examples of signals generated by oscillators include signals broadcast by radio and television transmitters, clock signals that regulate computers and quartz clocks, and the sounds produced by electronic beepers and video games.  Oscillators are often characterized by the frequency of their output signal:A low-frequency oscillator (LFO) is an electronic oscillator that generates a frequency below approximately 20 Hz.

Such a company may more easily transfer to or merge with companies in other member states. 2,827 registrations have been reported as of 14 August 2017, including the following nine components (18%) of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index of leading Euro Area companies (excluding the SE designation): Airbus, Allianz, BASF, E. 

Electronic mixer<====>9924<====>Electronic mixer  An electronic mixer is a device that combines two or more electrical or electronic signals into one or two composite output signals.  There are two basic circuits that both use the term mixer, but they are very different types of circuits: additive mixers and multiplicative mixers. Simple additive mixers use Kirchhoff's circuit laws to add the currents of two or more signals together, and this terminology ("mixer") is only used in the realm of audio electronics where audio mixers are used to add together audio signals such as voice signals, music signals, and sound effects. Multiplicative mixers multiply  together two time-varying input signals instantaneously (instant-by-instant). 

Eubulides<====>9925<====>EubulidesEubulides ( ; fl.  4th century BCE) of Miletus was a philosopher of the Megarian school, and a pupil of Euclid of Megara.   He is famous for his paradoxes. LifeEubulides was a pupil of Euclid of Megara, Diogenes Laërtius, ii.  108  the founder of the Megarian school.  He was a contemporary of Aristotle, against whom he wrote with great bitterness.   He taught logic to Demosthenes,  and he is also said to have taught Apollonius Cronus, the teacher of Diodorus Cronus, and the historian Euphantus.  He may have been the author of a book about Diogenes of Sinope. 

ETA (separatist group)<====>9926<====>ETA (separatist group)   ETA ( ;  ), an acronym for Euskadi Ta Askatasuna ( ; "Basque Homeland and Liberty"),   is a formerly armed leftist Basque nationalist and separatist organization in the Basque Country (in northern Spain and southwestern France).   The group was founded in 1959 and later evolved from a group promoting traditional Basque culture to a paramilitary group engaged in a violent campaign of bombing, assassinations and kidnappings in the Southern Basque Country and throughout Spanish territory.  Its goal was gaining independence for the Basque Country.    Goiz Argi. 

Endomembrane system<====>9927<====>Endomembrane system The endomembrane system is composed of the different membranes that are suspended in the cytoplasm within a eukaryotic cell.  These membranes divide the cell into functional and structural compartments, or organelles.  In eukaryotes the organelles of the endomembrane system include: the nuclear membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, vesicles, endosomes  and the cell membrane, among others.  The system is defined more accurately as the set of membranes that form a single functional and developmental unit, either being connected directly, or exchanging material through vesicle transport.   Importantly, the endomembrane system does not include the membranes of chloroplasts or mitochondria, but might have evolved from the latter (see below: Evolution). 

Ethnology<====>9928<====>Ethnology   Ethnology (from the Greek ἔθνος, ethnos meaning "nation" ) is the branch of anthropology that compares and analyses the characteristics of different peoples and the relationship between them (cf.  cultural, social, or sociocultural anthropology).    Scientific discipline Compared to ethnography, the study of single groups through direct contact with the culture, ethnology takes the research that ethnographers have compiled and then compares and contrasts different cultures. The term ethnologia (ethnology) is credited to Adam Franz Kollár (1718-1783) who used and defined it in his Historiae ivrisqve pvblici Regni Vngariae amoenitates published in Vienna in 1783. 

Espagnole sauce<====>9929<====>Espagnole sauceIn cooking, espagnole sauce ( ) is one of Auguste Escoffier's five mother sauces that are the basis of sauce-making in classic French cooking.   This type of sauce was already compiled in different Spanish cooking handbooks of the late 19th century.   Escoffier popularized the recipe, which is still followed today.  Escoffier (1903), Le Guide culinaire, Editions Flammarion Espagnole has a strong taste and is rarely used directly on food.  As a mother sauce it serves as the starting point for many derivatives, such as Sauce Africaine, Sauce Bigarade, Sauce Bourguignonne, sauce aux champignons, sauce charcutière, sauce chasseur, Sauce Chevreuil and demi-glace. 

Amplifier<====>9931<====>Amplifier  An amplifier, electronic amplifier or (informally) amp is an electronic device that can increase the power of a signal (a time-varying voltage or current).  An amplifier uses electric power from a power supply to increase the amplitude of a signal.   The amount of amplification provided by an amplifier is measured by its gain: the ratio of output voltage, current, or power to input.   An amplifier is a circuit that has a power gain greater than one.An amplifier can either be a separate piece of equipment or an electrical circuit contained within another device. 

Escort carrier<====>9932<====>Escort carrierThe escort carrier or escort aircraft carrier (US hull classification symbol CVE), also called a "jeep carrier" or "baby flattop" in the United States Navy (USN) or "Woolworth Carrier" by the Royal Navy, was a small and slow type of aircraft carrier used by the Royal Navy, the Imperial Japanese Navy and Imperial Japanese Army Air Force, and the United States Navy in World War II.  They were typically half the length and a third the displacement of larger fleet carriers.  While they were slower, carried fewer planes and were less well armed and armored, escort carriers were cheaper and could be built quickly, which was their principal advantage. 

Extreme sport<====>9933<====>Extreme sport Extreme sports are recreational activities perceived as involving a high degree of risk.  These activities often involve speed, height, a high level of physical exertion, and highly specialized gear.  SummaryThe definition of an extreme sport is not exact and the origin of the term is unclear, but it gained popularity in the 1990s when it was picked up by marketing companies to promote the X Games and when the Extreme Sports Channel and Extreme. com launched.  More recently, the commonly used definition from research is  "a competitive (comparison or self-evaluative) activity within which the participant is subjected to natural or unusual physical and mental challenges such as speed, height, depth or natural forces and where fast and accurate cognitive perceptual processing may be required for a successful outcome" by Dr. 

Eadgyth<====>9935<====>Eadgyth   Edith of England, also spelt Eadgyth or Ædgyth ( ,  ; 910 – 26 January 946), a member of the House of Wessex, was German queen from 936 until her death, by her marriage with King Otto I. LifeEdith was born to the reigning English king Edward the Elder by his second wife, Ælfflæd, and hence was a granddaughter of King Alfred the Great.  In 919 her sister Eadgifu married the West Frankish king Charles the Simple.  Nothing is known of Edith until at the request of the East Frankish king Henry the Fowler, who wished to stake a claim to equality and to seal the alliance between the two Saxon kingdoms, her half-brother King Æthelstan sent his sisters Edith and Edgiva to Germany. 

Kingdom of Essex<====>9937<====>Kingdom of Essex  The kingdom of the East Saxons ( ;  ), today referred to as the Kingdom of Essex, was one of the seven traditional kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy.   It was founded in the 6th century and covered the territory later occupied by the counties of Essex, Hertfordshire, Middlesex and (for a short while) Kent.  Kings of Essex were frequently subservient to foreign overlords.  The last king of Essex was Sigered and in 825, he ceded the kingdom to Egbert of Wessex. ExtentThe kingdom was bounded to the north by the River Stour and the Kingdom of East Anglia, to the south by the River Thames and Kent, to the east lay the North Sea and to the west Mercia. 

Æthelberht of Kent<====>9941<====>Æthelberht of Kent  Æthelberht ( ; also Æthelbert, Aethelberht, Aethelbert or Ethelbert, Old English Æðelberht,  ;   560 – 24 February 616) was King of Kent from about 589 until his death.  The eighth-century monk Bede, in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, lists him as the third king to hold imperium over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.  In the late ninth century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, he is referred to as a bretwalda, or "Britain-ruler".  He was the first English king to convert to Christianity. Æthelberht was the son of Eormenric, succeeding him as king, according to the Chronicle. 

Erwin Schrödinger<====>9942<====>Erwin Schrödinger    Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander Schrödinger ( ;   ; 12 August 1887 – 4 January 1961), sometimes written as   or  , was a Nobel Prize-winning Austrian physicist who developed a number of fundamental results in the field of quantum theory, which formed the basis of wave mechanics: he formulated the wave equation (stationary and time-dependent Schrödinger equation) and revealed the identity of his development of the formalism and matrix mechanics.  Schrödinger proposed an original interpretation of the physical meaning of the wave function. In addition, he was the author of many works in various fields of physics: statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, physics of dielectrics, colour theory, electrodynamics, general relativity, and cosmology, and he made several attempts to construct a unified field theory.

Ed Sullivan<====>9946<====>Ed Sullivan   Edward Vincent "Ed" Sullivan (September 28, 1901 – October 13, 1974) was an American television personality, sports and entertainment reporter, and syndicated columnist for the New York Daily News and the Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate.   He is principally remembered as the creator and host of the television variety program The Toast of the Town, later popularly—and, eventually, officially—renamed The Ed Sullivan Show.  Broadcast for 23 years from 1948 to 1971, it set a record as the longest-running variety show in US broadcast history.    "It was, by almost any measure, the last great TV show," said television critic David Hinckley. 

Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun<====>9948<====>Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun Élisabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun (Marie Élisabeth Louise; 16 April 1755 – 30 March 1842), also known as Madame Lebrun, was a prominent French painter. Her artistic style is generally considered part of the aftermath of Rococo, while she often adopted a neoclassical style.  Vigée Le Brun cannot be considered a pure Rococo or Neoclassical painter.  Her subject matter and color palette can be classified as Rococo, however, her style is aligned with the emergence of Neoclassicism.  Vigée Le Brun created a name for herself in Ancien Régime society by serving as the portrait painter to Marie Antoinette. 

Epistle to the Galatians<====>9949<====>Epistle to the Galatians  The Epistle to the Galatians, often shortened to Galatians, is the ninth book of the New Testament.  It is a letter from Paul the Apostle to a number of Early Christian communities in Galatia.  Scholars have suggested that this is either the Roman province of Galatia in southern Anatolia, or a large region defined by an ethnic group of Celtic people in central Anatolia.    Paul is principally concerned with the controversy surrounding Gentile Christians and the Mosaic Law during the Apostolic Age.  Paul argues that the Gentile Galatians do not need to adhere to the tenets of the Mosaic Law, particularly circumcision, by contextualizing the role of the law in light of the revelation of Christ. 

Epistle to the Philippians<====>9950<====>Epistle to the Philippians    The Epistle of Paul to the Philippians, often referred to simply as Philippians, is the eleventh book in the New Testament.  Paul and Timothy first visited Philippi in Greece during Paul's second missionary journey, which occurred between approximately 49 and 51 AD.  Philippi was the location of the first Christian community established in Europe. Biblical scholars are in general agreement that the letter was indeed written by Paul of Tarsus.  The estimated date of the letter is 62 AD, about 10 years after Paul's first visit to Philippi.  Harris, Stephen L. 

Epistle to the Colossians<====>9951<====>Epistle to the Colossians The Epistle of Paul to the Colossians, usually referred to simply as Colossians, is the twelfth book of the New Testament.  It was written, according to the text, by Paul the Apostle and Timothy to the Church in Colossae, a small Phrygian city near Laodicea and approximately   from Ephesus in Asia Minor.  "Colossians, Epistle to the. " Cross, F.  L. , ed.  The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church.

First Epistle to the Thessalonians<====>9952<====>First Epistle to the Thessalonians  The First Epistle to the Thessalonians, usually referred to simply as First Thessalonians (written 1 Thessalonians and abbreviated 1 Thess.   or 1 Thes. ), is a book from the New Testament of the Christian Bible.  The first letter to the Thessalonians was likely the first of Paul's letters, probably written by the end of AD 52.  Raymond E.  Brown, An Introduction to the New Testament, Anchor Bible, 1997.  pp.  456–466.  CompositionMost New Testament scholars believe Paul the Apostle wrote this letter from Corinth, although information appended to this work in many early manuscripts (e. 

Epistle to Titus<====>9953<====>Epistle to Titus  The Epistle of Paul to Titus, usually referred to simply as Titus, is one of the three Pastoral Epistles (along with 1 Timothy and 2 Timothy) in the New Testament, historically attributed to Paul the Apostle but now considered by most scholars to have been written by someone else.   It is addressed to Saint Titus and describes the requirements and duties of elders and bishops.  Harris, Stephen L. , Understanding the Bible.  Palo Alto: Mayfield.  1985.

Eurovision Song Contest<====>9954<====>Eurovision Song ContestThe Eurovision Song Contest (  since 1973;  sometimes popularly called Eurovision or Grand Prix but not to be confused with the Eurovision network that broadcasts it) is the longest-running annual international TV song competition,  held, primarily, among the member countries of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) since 1956.  The competition was based upon the existing Sanremo Music Festival held in Italy since 1951. Each participating country submits an original song to be performed on live television and radio and then casts votes for the other countries' songs to determine the most popular song in the competition. 

Nitrox<====>9955<====>Nitrox  Nitrox refers to any gas mixture composed (excepting trace gases) of nitrogen and oxygen.  This includes atmospheric air, which is approximately 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gases, primarily argon. In the usual application, underwater diving, nitrox is normally distinguished from air and handled differently.   The most common use of nitrox mixtures containing oxygen in higher proportions than atmospheric air is in scuba diving, where the reduced partial pressure of nitrogen is advantageous in reducing nitrogen uptake in the body's tissues, thereby extending the practicable underwater dive time by reducing the decompression requirement, or reducing the risk of decompression sickness (also known as the bends). 

Erik Satie<====>9956<====>Erik Satie   Éric Alfred Leslie Satie ( ; 17 May 1866 1 July 1925), who signed his name Erik Satie after 1884, was a French composer and pianist.  Satie was a colourful figure in the early 20th-century Parisian avant-garde.  His work was a precursor to later artistic movements such as minimalism, Surrealism, repetitive music, and the Theatre of the Absurd.  An eccentric, Satie was introduced as a "gymnopedist" in 1887, shortly before writing his most famous compositions, the Gymnopédies.  Later, he also referred to himself as a "phonometrician" (meaning "someone who measures sounds"), preferring this designation to that of "musician",  after having been called "a clumsy but subtle technician" in a book on contemporary French composers published in 1911. 

Elliptic integral<====>9960<====>Elliptic integralIn integral calculus, elliptic integrals originally arose in connection with the problem of giving the arc length of an ellipse.   They were first studied by Giulio Fagnano and Leonhard Euler ( ).   Modern mathematics defines an "elliptic integral" as any function   which can be expressed in the form  f(x) = \int_{c}^{x} R \left(t, \sqrt{P(t)} \right) \, dt,  where   is a rational function of its two arguments,   is a polynomial of degree 3 or 4 with no repeated roots, and   is a constant. In general, integrals in this form cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. 

Epistle to the Romans<====>9961<====>Epistle to the Romans   The Epistle to the Romans or Letter to the Romans, often shortened to Romans, is the sixth book in the New Testament.  Biblical scholars agree that it was composed by the Apostle Paul to explain that salvation is offered through the gospel of Jesus Christ.  It is the longest of the Pauline epistles   and is often considered   his "most important theological legacy" and magnum opus. General presentationIn the opinion of Jesuit scholar Joseph Fitzmyer, the book "overwhelms the reader by the density and sublimity of the topic with which it deals, the gospel of the justification and salvation of Jew and Greek alike by the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ, revealing the uprightness and love of God the Father. 

Eleanor of Aquitaine<====>9962<====>Eleanor of Aquitaine  Eleanor of Aquitaine ( ,  ; 1122  – 1 April 1204) was Queen consort of France (1137–1152) and England (1154–1189) and Duchess of Aquitaine in her own right.  As a member of the Ramnulfids (House of Poitiers) rulers in southwestern France, she was one of the most powerful and wealthiest women in western Europe during the High Middle Ages.  She was patron of literary figures such as Wace, Benoît de Sainte-Maure, and Bernart de Ventadorn.  She led armies several times in her life and was a leader of the Second Crusade. As Duchess of Aquitaine, Eleanor was the most eligible bride in Europe. 

Epistle to Philemon<====>9963<====>Epistle to Philemon   The Epistle of Paul to Philemon, known simply as Philemon, is one of the books of the Christian New Testament.  It is a prison letter, co-authored by Paul the Apostle with Timothy, to Philemon, a leader in the Colossian church.  It deals with the themes of forgiveness and reconciliation.  Paul does not identify himself as an apostle with authority, but as "a prisoner for Jesus Christ", calling Timothy "our brother", and addressing Philemon as "fellow labourer" and "brother. "  Onesimus, a slave that had departed from his master Philemon, was returning with this epistle wherein Paul asked Philemon to receive him as a "brother beloved. 

Elliptic-curve cryptography<====>9966<====>Elliptic-curve cryptographyElliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) is an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields.  ECC requires smaller keys compared to non-ECC cryptography (based on plain Galois fields) to provide equivalent security.  Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite and Quantum Computing FAQ U. S.  National Security Agency, January 2016.  Elliptic curves are applicable for key agreement, digital signatures, pseudo-random generators and other tasks.  Indirectly, they can be used for encryption by combining the key agreement with a symmetric encryption scheme.  They are also used in several integer factorization algorithms based on elliptic curves that have applications in cryptography, such as Lenstra elliptic-curve factorization.

Linear filter<====>9975<====>Linear filter Linear filters process time-varying input signals to produce output signals, subject to the constraint of linearity.  This results from systems composed solely of components (or digital algorithms) classified as having a linear response.  Most filters implemented in analog electronics, in digital signal processing, or in mechanical systems are classified as causal, time invariant, and linear signal processing filters. The general concept of linear filtering is also used in statistics, data analysis, and mechanical engineering among other fields and technologies.  This includes non-causal filters and filters in more than one dimension such as those used in image processing; those filters are subject to different constraints leading to different design methods. 

Ergative case<====>9976<====>Ergative caseThe ergative case (abbreviated  ) is the grammatical case that identifies the noun   as a subject of a transitive verb in ergative–absolutive languages. CharacteristicsIn such languages, the ergative case is typically marked (most salient), while the absolutive case is unmarked.  New work in case theory has vigorously supported the idea that the ergative case identifies the agent (the intentful performer of an action) of a verb (Woolford 2004). In Kalaallisut (Greenlandic) for example, the ergative case is used to mark subjects of transitive verbs and possessors of nouns. Nez Perce has a three-way nominal case system with both ergative (-nim) and accusative (-ne) plus an absolute (unmarked) case for intransitive subjects: hipáayna qíiwn ‘the old man arrived’; hipáayna wewúkiye ‘the elk arrived’; wewúkiyene péexne qíiwnim ‘the old man saw an elk’.

Essenes<====>9978<====>Essenes   The Essenes (in Modern Hebrew:  , Isiyim; Greek: Ἐσσηνοί, Ἐσσαῖοι, or Ὀσσαῖοι, Essenoi, Essaioi, Ossaioi) were a sect of  Second Temple Judaism that flourished from the 2nd century BC to the 1st century AD which some scholars claim seceded from the Zadokite priests.   Being much fewer in number than the Pharisees and the Sadducees (the other two major sects at the time), the Essenes lived in various cities but congregated in communal life dedicated to asceticism (some groups practised celibacy), voluntary poverty, and daily immersion.  Many separate but related religious groups of that era shared similar mystic, eschatological, messianic, and ascetic beliefs. 

Eyes Wide Shut<====>9979<====>Eyes Wide Shut  Eyes Wide Shut is a 1999 erotic drama film  directed, produced, and co-written by Stanley Kubrick.  Based on Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 novella Traumnovelle (Dream Story), the story is transferred from early 20th century Vienna to 1990s New York City.  The film follows the sexually charged adventures of Dr.  Bill Harford, who is shocked when his wife, Alice, reveals that she had contemplated having  an affair a year earlier.  He embarks on a night-long adventure, during which he infiltrates a massive masked orgy of an unnamed secret society. Kubrick obtained the filming rights for Dream Story in the 1960s, considering it a perfect text for a  film adaptation about sexual relations.

It is broken into two major and overlapping branches:Aeronautical engineering – deals with craft that stay within Earth's atmosphereAstronautical engineering – deals with craft that operates outside of Earth's atmosphereApplied engineering – application of management, design, and technical skills for the design and integration of systems, the execution of new product designs, the improvement of manufacturing processes, and the management and direction of physical and/or technical functions of a firm or organization. 

Outline of entertainment<====>9988<====>Outline of entertainment The following outline provides an overview of and topical guide to entertainment and the entertainment industry:Entertainment is any activity which provides a diversion or permits people to amuse themselves in their leisure time, and may also provide fun, enjoyment and laughter.  People may create their own entertainment, such as when they spontaneously invent a  game; participate actively in an activity they find entertaining, such as when they play sport as a hobby; or consume an entertainment product passively, such as when they attend a performance.  The entertainment industry (informally known as show business or show biz) is part of the tertiary sector of the economy and includes a large number of sub-industries devoted to entertainment. 

List of contemporary ethnic groups<====>9992<====>List of contemporary ethnic groups The following is a list of contemporary ethnic groups.  There has been constant debate over the classification of ethnic groups.  Membership of an ethnic group tends to be associated with shared cultural heritage, ancestry, history, homeland, language or dialect, the term culture specifically including aspects such as religion, mythology and ritual, cuisine, dressing style, etc.  By the nature of the concept, ethnic groups tend to be divided into ethnic subgroups, which may themselves be or not be identified as independent ethnic groups depending on the source consulted. Ethnic groups The groups commonly identified as "ethnic groups" (as opposed to ethno-linguistic phyla, national groups, racial groups or similar). 

Edda<====>9993<====>Edda  "Edda" ( ; Old Norse Edda,  plural Eddur) is an Old Norse term that has been attributed by modern scholars to the collective of two Medieval Icelandic literary works: what is now known as the Prose Edda and an older collection of poems without an original title now known as the Poetic Edda.  The term historically referred only to the Prose Edda, but this since has fallen out of use because of the confusion with the other work.  Both works were written down in Iceland during the 13th century in Icelandic, although they contain material from earlier traditional sources, reaching into the Viking Age. 

Ephemeris time<====>9994<====>Ephemeris timeThe term ephemeris time (often abbreviated ET) can in principle refer to time in connection with any astronomical ephemeris.  In practice it has been used more specifically to refer to:a former standard astronomical time scale adopted in 1952 by the IAU, 'ESAE 1961': 'Explanatory Supplement (1961), esp.  p. 9.   and superseded in the 1970s.  'ESAA (1992)': P K Seidelmann (ed). , especially  at pp. 41-42 and at p. 79.    This time scale was proposed in 1948, to overcome the drawbacks of irregularly fluctuating mean solar time.   The intent was to define a uniform time (as far as was then feasible) based on Newtonian theory (see below: Definition of ephemeris time (1952)). 

EastEnders<====>9995<====>EastEnders    EastEnders is a British soap opera created by Julia Smith and Tony Holland which has been broadcast on BBC One since 1985.  Set in Albert Square in the East End of London in the fictional Borough of Walford, the programme follows the stories of local residents and their families as they go about their daily lives.  Initially there were two 30-minute episodes per week but since 2001 episodes have been broadcast every weekday apart from Wednesdays. Within eight months of the show's launch, it reached the number-one spot in BARB's TV ratings and has consistently remained among the top-rated TV programmes in Britain. 

Embroidery<====>9996<====>Embroidery Embroidery is the craft of decorating fabric or other materials using a needle to apply thread or yarn. Embroidery may also incorporate other materials such as pearls, beads, quills, and  sequins.  In modern days, embroidery is usually seen on caps, hats, coats, blankets, dress shirts, denim, dresses, stockings, and golf shirts.  Embroidery is available with a wide variety of thread or yarn color. Some of the basic techniques or stitches of the earliest embroidery are chain stitch, buttonhole or blanket stitch, running stitch, satin stitch, cross stitch.  Those stitches remain the fundamental techniques of hand embroidery today. 

Edward Mitchell Bannister<====>9997<====>Edward Mitchell Bannister Edward Mitchell Bannister (ca.  1828 – January 9, 1901) was a Black Canadian-American Tonalist painter.  Like other Tonalists, his style and predominantly pastoral subject matter were drawn from his admiration for Millet and the French Barbizon School. BiographyBannister was born in St.  Andrews, New Brunswick and moved to New England in the late 1840s, where he remained for the rest of his life.  While Bannister was well known in the artistic community of his adopted home of Providence, Rhode Island and admired within the wider East Coast art world (he won a bronze medal for his large oil "Under the Oaks" at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial), he was largely forgotten for almost a century for a complexity of reasons, principally connected with racial prejudice.

Emil Kraepelin<====>10002<====>Emil Kraepelin  Emil Kraepelin ( ; 15 February 1856 – 7 October 1926) was a German psychiatrist.  H.  J.  Eysenck's Encyclopedia of Psychology identifies him as the founder of modern scientific psychiatry, psychopharmacology and psychiatric genetics. Kraepelin believed the chief origin of psychiatric disease to be biological and genetic malfunction.  His theories dominated psychiatry at the start of the 20th century and, despite the later psychodynamic influence of Sigmund Freud and his disciples, enjoyed a revival at century's end.   While he proclaimed his own high clinical standards of gathering information "by means of expert analysis of individual cases", he also drew on reported observations of officials not trained in psychiatry. 

Evoluon<====>10003<====>Evoluon  The Evoluon is a conference centre and former science museum erected by the electronics and electrical company Philips at Eindhoven in the Netherlands in 1966.  Since its construction, it has become a landmark and a symbol for the city. The building is unique due to its very futuristic design, resembling a landed flying saucer.  It was designed by architects Leo de Bever and Louis Christiaan Kalff,    while the exhibition it housed was conceived by James Gardner.  De Bever and Kalff only got two demands for the design of the building, it had to be "spectacular" and it had to be possible to hold exhibitions in the building. 

Educational essentialism<====>10004<====>Educational essentialismEducational essentialism is an educational philosophy whose adherents believe that children should learn the traditional basic subjects thoroughly.  In this philosophical school of thought, the aim is to instill students with the "essentials" of academic knowledge, enacting a back-to-basics approach.  Essentialism ensures that the accumulated wisdom of our civilization as taught in the traditional academic disciplines is passed on from teacher to student.  Such disciplines might include Reading, Writing, Literature, Foreign Languages, History, Mathematics, Science, Art, and Music.  Moreover, this traditional approach is meant to train the mind, promote reasoning, and ensure a common culture. 

Progressive education<====>10005<====>Progressive education Progressive education is a pedagogical movement that began in the late nineteenth century; it has persisted in various forms to the present. The term progressive was engaged to distinguish this education from the traditional Euro-American curricula of the 19th century, which was rooted in classical preparation for the university and strongly differentiated by social class. By contrast, progressive education finds its roots in present experience.   Most progressive education programs have these qualities in common:  Emphasis on learning by doing – hands-on projects, expeditionary learning, experiential learningIntegrated curriculum focused on thematic unitsIntegration of entrepreneurship into educationStrong emphasis on problem solving and critical thinkingGroup work and development of social skillsUnderstanding and action as the goals of learning as opposed to rote knowledgeCollaborative and cooperative learning projectsEducation for social responsibility and democracyHighly personalized learning accounting for each individual's personal goalsIntegration of community service and service learning projects into the daily curriculumSelection of subject content by looking forward to ask what skills will be needed in future societyDe-emphasis on textbooks in favor of varied learning resourcesEmphasis on lifelong learning and social skillsAssessment by evaluation of child's projects and productionsEducational theoryProgressive education can be traced back to the works of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, both of whom are known as forerunners of ideas that would be developed by theorists such as Dewey. Locke believed that "truth and knowledge… arise out of observation and experience rather than manipulation of accepted or given ideas".He further discussed the need for children to have concrete experiences in order to learn. Rousseau deepened this line of thinking in Emile, or On Education, where he argued that subordination of students to teachers and memorization of facts would not lead to an education.Johann Bernhard BasedowIn Germany, Johann Bernhard Basedow (1724–1790) established the Philanthropinum at Dessau in 1774. He developed new teaching methods based on conversation and play with the child, and a program of physical development. Such was his success that he wrote a treatise on his methods, "On the best and hitherto unknown method of teaching children of noblemen".Christian Gotthilf SalzmannChristian Gotthilf Salzmann (1744–1811) was the founder of the Schnepfenthal institution, a school dedicated to new modes of education (derived heavily from the ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau). He wrote Elements of Morality, for the Use of Children, one of the first books translated into English by Mary Wollstonecraft.Johann Heinrich PestalozziJohann Heinrich Pestalozzi (1746–1827) was a Swiss pedagogue and educational reformer who exemplified Romanticism in his approach. He founded several educational institutions both in German- and French-speaking regions of Switzerland and wrote many works explaining his revolutionary modern principles of education. His motto was "Learning by head, hand and heart". His research and theories closely resemble those outlined by Rousseau in Emile. He is further considered by many to be the "father of modern educational science"  His psychological theories pertain to education as they focus on the development of object teaching, that is, he felt that individuals best learned through experiences and through a direct manipulation and experience of objects. He further speculated that children learn through their own internal motivation rather than through compulsion. (See Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic motivation). A teacher's task will be to help guide their students as individuals through their learning and allow it to unfold naturally. Friedrich FröbelFriedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel (1782–1852) was a student of Pestalozzi who laid the foundation for modern education based on the recognition that children have unique needs and capabilities. He believed in "self-activity" and play as essential factors in child education. The teacher's role was not to indoctrinate but to encourage self-expression through play, both individually and in group activities. He created the concept of kindergarten.Johann Friedrich HerbartJohann Friedrich Herbart (1776–1841) emphasized the connection between individual development and the resulting societal contribution. The five key ideas which composed his concept of individual maturation were Inner Freedom, Perfection, Benevolence, Justice, and Equity or Recompense.  According to Herbart, abilities were not innate but could be instilled, so a thorough education could provide the framework for moral and intellectual development.  In order to develop a child to lead to a consciousness of social responsibility, Herbart advocated that teachers utilize a methodology with five formal steps: "Using this structure a teacher prepared a topic of interest to the children, presented that topic, and questioned them inductively, so that they reached new knowledge based on what they had already known, looked back, and deductively summed up the lesson's achievements, then related them to moral precepts for daily living". John Melchior BoscoJohn Melchior Bosco (1815–1888) was concerned about the education of street children who had left their villages to find work in the rapidly industrialized city of Turin, Italy. Exploited as cheap labor or imprisoned for unruly behavior, Bosco saw the need of creating a space where they would feel at home. He called it an 'Oratory' where they could play, learn, share friendships, express themselves, develop their creative talents and pick up skills for gainful self-employment. With those who had found work, he set up a mutual-fund society (an early version of the Grameen Bank) to teach them the benefits of saving and self-reliance. The principles underlying his educational method that won over the hearts and minds of thousands of youth who flocked to his oratory were: 'be reasonable', 'be kind', 'believe' and 'be generous in service'. Today his method of education is practiced in nearly 3000 institutions set up around the world by the members of the Salesian Society he founded in 1873.Cecil ReddieWhile studying for his doctorate in Göttingen in 1882–1883, Cecil Reddie was greatly impressed by the progressive educational theories being applied there.  Reddie founded Abbotsholme School in Derbyshire, England in 1889. Its curriculum enacted the ideas of progressive education. Reddie rejected rote learning, classical languages and corporal punishment. He combined studies in modern languages and the sciences and arts with a program of physical exercise, manual labour, recreation, crafts and arts. Abbotsholme was imitated throughout Europe and was particularly influential in Germany.  He often engaged foreign teachers, who learned its practices, before returning home to start their own schools. Hermann Lietz an Abbotsholme teacher founded five schools (Landerziehungsheime für Jungen) on Abbotsholme's principles.    Other people he influenced included Kurt Hahn, Adolphe Ferrière and Edmond Demolins. His ideas also reached Japan, where it turned into "Taisho-era Free Education Movement" (Taisho Jiyu Kyoiku Undo)John DeweyIn the United States the "Progressive Education Movement", starting in the 1880s and lasting for sixty years, helped boost American public schools from a budding idea to the regular norm. John Dewey, a principal figure in this movement from the 1880s to 1904, set the tone for educational philosophy as well as concrete school reforms. His thinking had been influenced by the ideas of Fröbel and Herbart.   His reactions to the prevailing theories and practices in education, corrections made to these philosophies, and recommendations to teachers and administrators to embrace "the new education", provide a vital account of the history of the development of educational thinking in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Dewey placed so-called pragmatism above moral absolutes and helped give rise to situational ethics.   Beginning in 1897 John Dewey published a summary of his theory on progressive education in School Journal. His theoretical standpoints are divided into five sections outlined below.What education isEducation according to Dewey is the "participation of the individual in the social consciousness of the race" (Dewey, 1897, para. 1).  As such, education should take into account that the student is a social being. The process begins at birth with the child unconsciously gaining knowledge and gradually developing their knowledge to share and partake in society.The educational process has two sides, the psychological and the sociological, with the psychological forming the basis. (Dewey, 1897). A child's own instincts will help develop the material that is presented to them. These instincts also form the basis of their knowledge with everything building upon it. This forms the basis of Dewey's assumption that one cannot learn without motivation.Instruction must focus on the child as a whole for you can never be sure as to where society may end or where that student will be needed or will take them.What the school is"Education fails because it neglects this fundamental principle of the school as a form of community life. It conceives the school as a place where certain information is to be given, where certain lessons are to be learned, or where certain habits are to be formed" (Dewey, 1897, para. 17) Dewey felt that as education is a social construct, it is, therefore, a part of society and should reflect the community."Education is the process of living and is not meant to be the preparation of future living", (Dewey, 1897), so the school must represent the present life. As such, parts of the student's home life (such as moral and ethical education) should take part in the schooling process. The teacher is a part of this, not as an authoritative figure, but as a member of the community who is there to assist the student.The subject matter of educationAccording to Dewey, the curriculum in the schools should reflect that of society. The center of the school curriculum should reflect the development of humans in society. The study of the core subjects (language, science, history) should be coupled with the study of cooking, sewing, and manual training. Furthermore, he feels that "progress is not in the succession of studies but in the development of new attitudes towards, and new interests in, experience" (Dewey, 1897, para. 38)The nature of methodThe method is focused on the child's powers and interests. If the child is thrown into a passive role as a student, absorbing information, the result is a waste of the child's education. (Dewey, 1897). Information presented to the student will be transformed into new forms, images, and symbols by the student so that they fit with their development and interests. The development of this is natural. To repress this process and attempt to "substitute the adult for the child" (Dewey, 1897, para. 52) would weaken the intellectual curiosity of the child.The school and social progressEducation is the most fundamental method of social reconstruction for progress and reform. Dewey believes that "education is a regulation of the process of coming to share in the social consciousness; and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction" (Dewey, 1897, para. 60). As such, Dewey gives way to Social Reconstruction and schools as means to reconstruct society (See Social Reconstruction in Education).  Finally, as schools become a means for social reconstruction, our educations must be given the proper equipment to help perform this task and guide their students. Dewey, John. (1897). My pedagogical creed. School Journal. 54. pp. 77–80. Retrieved on November 4, 2011 from   Laborschule Bielefeld was founded in 1974 in Germany. The Laborschule explicitly uses democratic concepts as suggested by Dewey. Studies in the last years have proven the successful implementation of these concepts into a living community.Helen ParkhurstThe American teacher Helen Parkhurst (1886–1973) developed at the beginning of the twentieth century the Dalton Plan to reform the then current pedagogics and the then usual manner of classroom management. She wanted to break the teacher-centered lockstep teaching. During her first experiment, which she implemented in a small elementary school as a young teacher in 1904, she noticed that when students are given freedom for self-direction and self-pacing and to help one another, their motivation increases considerably and they learn a lot more. In a later experiment in 1911 and 1912 Parkhurst re-organized the education in a large school for nine to fourteen year-olds. Instead of each grade, each subject was appointed its own teacher and its own classroom. The subject teachers made assignments: they converted the subject matter for each grade into learning assignments. In this way, learning became the students’ own work; they could carry out their work independently, work at their own pace and plan their work themselves. The classroom turned into a laboratory, a place where students are working, furnished and equipped as work spaces, tailored to meet the requirements of specific subjects. Useful and attractive learning materials, instruments and reference books were put within the students’ reach. The benches were replaced by large tables to facilitate co-operation and group instruction. This second experiment formed the basis for the next experiments, those in Dalton and New York, from 1919 onwards. The only addition was the use of graphs, charts enabling students to keep track of their own progress in each subject. From now on it was called the Dalton Plan. "Dalton education" In the nineteen-twenties and nineteen-thirties, Dalton education was spread throughout the world. There is no certainty regarding the exact numbers of Dalton schools, but there was Dalton education in America, Australia, England, Germany, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, India, China and Japan. Particularly in the Netherlands, China and Japan, Dalton education has remained in existence. In recent years there has been a revival of international interest. It crops up again, for instance, in England, Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Netherlands is the country with the highest density of Dalton schools. At the moment (2013) there are five hundred; most of them elementary schools. Comprising five percent of all elementary schools, Dalton education is by far the largest educational reform movement in the Netherlands. And, contrary to Montessori, Jena Plan and Waldorf education, it is steadily on the increase. The only Dalton school in the USA, is the school that Helen Parkhurst founded herself in 1919, and which she was subsequently to direct for more than twenty years: the Dalton School in New York. It is a renowned school. But today its fame is not due to its origins as an experiment in progressive education: the Dalton School is one of the most expensive private schools in New York. Rudolf SteinerRudolf Steiner (1869–1925) first described the principles of what was to become Waldorf education in 1907. He established a series of schools based on these principles beginning in 1919. The focus of the education is on creating a developmentally-appropriate curriculum that holistically integrates practical, artistic, social, and academic experiences.   There are more than a thousand schools and many more early childhood centers worldwide; it has also become a popular form of homeschooling. Statistics for Waldorf schools worldwide  Maria MontessoriMaria Montessori (1870–1952) began to develop her philosophy and methods in 1897. She based her work on her observations of children and experimentation with the environment, materials, and lessons available to them. She frequently referred to her work as "scientific pedagogy". Although Montessori education spread to the United States in 1911 there were conflicts with the American educational establishment and was opposed by William Heard Kilpatrick. However Montessori education returned to the United States in 1960 and has since spread to thousands of schools there.Robert Baden-PowellIn July 1906, Ernest Thompson Seton sent Robert Baden-Powell a copy of his book The Birchbark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians. Seton was a British-born Canadian-American living in the United States. They shared ideas about youth training programs.  In 1907 Baden-Powell wrote a draft called Boy Patrols. In the same year, to test his ideas, he gathered 21 boys of mixed social backgrounds and held a week-long camp in August on Brownsea Island in England.  His organizational method, now known as the Patrol System and a key part of Scouting training, allowed the boys to organize themselves into small groups with an elected patrol leader.  Baden Powell then wrote Scouting for Boys (London, 1908). The Brownsea camp and the publication of  Scouting for Boys are generally regarded as the start of the Scout movement which spread throughout the world. Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes Baden-Powell introduced the Girl Guides in 1910.Comparison with traditional education Traditional education uses extrinsic motivation, such as grades and prizes. Progressive education is more likely to use intrinsic motivation, basing activities on the interests of the child. Praise may be discouraged as a motivator. 21st century skills 21st century skills are a series of higher-order skills, abilities, and learning dispositions that have been identified as being required for success in the rapidly changing, digital society and workplaces.  Many of these skills are also defining qualities of progressive education as well as being associated with deeper learning, which is based on mastering skills such as analytic reasoning, complex problem solving, and teamwork.  These skills differ from traditional academic skills in that they are not primarily content knowledge-based.

Paul Robin implemented progressive principles at the orphanage at Cempuis from 1880 to 1894. This was the first French mixed school, and a scandal at that time. Sebastien Faure in 1904 created a libertarian school 'La Ruche' (the Hive).GermanyHermann Lietz founded three Landerziehungsheime (country boarding schools) in 1904 based on Reddie's model for boys of different ages. Lietz eventually succeeded in establishing five more Landerziehungsheime.  Edith and Paul Geheeb founded Odenwaldschule in Heppenheim in the Odenwald in 1910 using their concept of progressive education, which integrated the work of the head and hand. PolandJanusz Korczak was one notable follower and  developer of  Pestalozzi's ideas. He wroteThe names of Pestalozzi, Froebel and Spencer shine with no less brilliance than the names of the greatest inventors of the twentieth century. For they discovered more than the unknown forces of nature; they discovered the unknown half of humanity: children.  His Orphan's Home in Warsaw became a model institution and exerted influence on the educational process in other orphanages of the same type. SpainIn Spain, the Escuela Moderna was founded in 1901 by Francisco Ferrer, a Catalan educator and anarchist. He had been influenced by Cecil Reddie. The Modern Schools, also called 'Ferrer Schools', that were founded in the United States, were based on Escuela Moderna. As in Spain the schools were intended to educate the working-classes from a secular, class-conscious perspective. The Modern Schools imparted day-time academic classes for children, and night-time continuing-education lectures for adults.SwedenIn Sweden, an early proponent of progressive education was Alva Myrdal, who with her husband Gunnar co-wrote Kris i befolkningsfrågan (1934), a most influential program for the social-democratic hegemony (1932–1976) popularly known as "Folkhemmet". School reforms went through government reports in the 1940s and trials in the 1950s, resulting in the introduction in 1962 of public comprehensive schools ("grundskola") instead of the previously separated parallel schools for theoretical and non-theoretical education. United KingdomThe ideas from Reddie's Abbotsholme spread to schools such as Bedales School (1893), King Alfred School, London (1898) and St Christopher School, Letchworth (1915), as well as all the Friends' schools, Steiner Waldorf schools and those belonging to the Round Square Conference. The King Alfred School was radical for its time in that it provided a secular education and that boys and girls were educated together. A Progressive Education  Alexander Sutherland Neill believed children should achieve self-determination and should be encouraged to think critically rather than blindly obeying. He implemented his ideas with the founding of Summerhill School in 1921. Neill believed that children learn better when they are not compelled to attend lessons. The school was also managed democratically, with regular meetings to determine school rules. Pupils had equal voting rights with school staff.United StatesEarly practitionersFröbel's student Margarethe Schurz founded the first kindergarten in the United States at Watertown, Wisconsin in 1856, and she also inspired Elizabeth Peabody, who went on to found the first English-speaking kindergarten in the United States – the language at Schurz's kindergarten had been German, to serve an immigrant community – in Boston in 1860. This paved the way for the concept's spread in the USA. The German émigré Adolph Douai had also founded a kindergarten in Boston in 1859, but was obliged to close it after only a year. By 1866, however, he was founding others in New York City.William Heard Kilpatrick (1871–1965) was a pupil of Dewey and one of the most effective practitioners of the concept as well as the more adept at proliferating the progressive education movement and spreading word of the works of Dewey. He is especially well known for his "project method of teaching".  This developed the progressive education notion that students were to be engaged and taught so that their knowledge may be directed to society for a socially useful need. Like Dewey he also felt that students should be actively engaged in their learning rather than actively disengaged with the simple reading and regurgitation of material. The most famous early practitioner of progressive education was Francis Parker; its best-known spokesperson was the philosopher John Dewey.  In 1875 Francis Parker became superintendent of schools in Quincy, Massachusetts after spending two years in Germany studying emerging educational trends on the continent. Parker was opposed to rote learning, believing that there was no value in knowledge without understanding. He argued instead schools should encourage and respect the child's creativity. Parker's Quincy System called for child-centered and experience-based learning.   He replaced the traditional curriculum with integrated learning units based on core themes related to the knowledge of different disciplines. He replaced traditional readers, spellers and grammar books with children's own writing, literature, and teacher prepared materials. In 1883 Parker left Massachusetts to become Principal of the Cook County Normal School in Chicago, a school that also served to train teachers in Parker's methods. In 1894 Parker's Talks on Pedagogics, which drew heavily on the thinking of Fröbel, Pestalozzi and Herbart, became one of the first American writings on education to gain international fame.That same year, philosopher John Dewey moved from the University of Michigan to the newly established University of Chicago where he became chair of the department of philosophy, psychology and education. He and his wife enrolled their children in Parker's school before founding their own school two years later.Whereas Parker started with practice and then moved to theory, Dewey began with hypotheses and then devised methods and curricula to test them. By the time Dewey moved to Chicago at the age of thirty-five, he had already published two books on psychology and applied psychology. He had become dissatisfied with philosophy as pure speculation and was seeking ways to make philosophy directly relevant to practical issues. Moving away from an early interest in Hegel, Dewey proceeded to reject all forms of dualism and dichotomy in favor of a philosophy of experience as a series of unified wholes in which everything can be ultimately related.In 1896, John Dewey opened what he called the laboratory school to test his theories and their sociological implications. With Dewey as the director and his wife as principal, the University of Chicago Laboratory school, was dedicated "to discover in administration, selection of subject-matter, methods of learning, teaching, and discipline, how a school could become a cooperative community while developing in individuals their own capacities and satisfy their own needs." (Cremin, 136) For Dewey the two key goals of developing a cooperative community and developing individuals' own capacities were not at odds; they were necessary to each other. This unity of purpose lies at the heart of the progressive education philosophy. In 1912, Dewey sent out students of his philosophy to found The Park School of Buffalo and The Park School of Baltimore to put it into practice. These schools operate to this day within a similar progressive approach.At Columbia, Dewey worked with other educators such as Charles Eliot and Abraham Flexner to help bring progressivism into the mainstream of American education. In 1917 Columbia established the Lincoln School of Teachers College "as a laboratory for the working out of an elementary and secondary curriculum which shall eliminate obsolete material and endeavor to work up in usable form material adapted to the needs of modern living." (Cremin, 282)  Based on Flexner's demand that the modern curriculum "include nothing for which an affirmative case can not be made out" (Cremin, 281) the new school organized its activities around four fundamental fields: science, industry, aesthetics and civics. The Lincoln School built its curriculum around "units of work" that reorganized traditional subject matter into forms embracing the development of children and the changing needs of adult life. The first and second grades carried on a study of community life in which they actually built a city. A third grade project growing out of the day-to-day life of the nearby Hudson River became one of the most celebrated units of the school, a unit on boats, which under the guidance of its legendary teacher Miss Curtis, became an entrée into history, geography, reading, writing, arithmetic, science, art and literature. Each of the units was broadly enough conceived so that different children could concentrate on different aspects depending on their own interests and needs. Each of the units called for widely diverse student activities, and each sought to deal in depth with some critical aspect of contemporary civilization. Finally each unit engaged children working together cooperatively and also provided opportunities for individual research and exploration.In 1924, Agnes de Lima, the lead writer on education for The New Republic and The Nation, published a collection of her articles on progressive education as a book, titled Our Enemy the Child. In 1918 The National Education Association, representing superintendents and administrators in smaller districts across the country, issued its report "Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education."  It emphasized the education of students in terms of health, a command of fundamental processes, worthy home membership, vocation, citizenship, worthy use of leisure, and ethical character. They Emphasized life adjustment and reflected the social efficiency model of progressive education. From 1919 to 1955 the Progressive Education Association founded by Stanwood Cobb and others worked to promote a more student-centered approach to education. During the Great Depression the organization conducted an Eight Year study evaluating the effects of progressive programs. More than 1500 students over four years were compared to an equal number of carefully matched students at conventional schools. When they reached college, the experimental students were found to equal or surpass traditionally educated students on all outcomes: grades, extracurricular participation, dropout rates, intellectual curiosity, and resourcefulness. Moreover, the study found that the more the school departed from the traditional college preparatory program, the better was the record of the graduates. (Kohn, Schools, 232)By mid-century many public school programs had also adopted elements of progressive curriculum. At mid-century Dewey believed that progressive education had "not really penetrated and permeated the foundations of the educational institution."(Kohn, Schools, 6,7)  As the influence of progressive pedagogy grew broader and more diffuse, practitioners began to vary their application of progressive principles.   As varying interpretations and practices made evaluation of progressive reforms more difficult to assess, critics began to propose alternative approaches.The seeds of the debate over progressive education can be seen in the differences of Parker and Dewey. These have to do with how much and by whom curriculum should be worked out from grade to grade, how much the child's emerging interests should determine classroom activities, the importance of child-centered vs. societal–centered learning, the relationship of community building to individual growth, and especially the relationship between emotion, thought and experience.In 1955 the publication of Rudolf Flesch's Why Johnny Can't Read leveled criticism of reading programs at the progressive emphasis on reading in context. The conservative McCarthy era raised questions about the liberal ideas at the roots of the progressive reforms. The launching of Sputnik in 1957 at the height of the cold war gave rise to a number of intellectually competitive approaches to disciplinary knowledge, such as BSCS biology PSSC physics, led by university professors such as Jerome Bruner and Jerrold Zacharias.Interestingly, some of the cold war reforms incorporated elements of progressivism. For example, the work of Zacharias and Bruner was based in the developmental psychology of Jean Piaget and incorporated many of Dewey's ideas of experiential education. Bruner's analysis of developmental psychology became the core of a pedagogical movement known as constructivism, which argues that the child is an active participant in making meaning and must be engaged in the progress of education for learning to be effective. This psychological approach has deep connections to the work of both Parker and Dewey and led to a resurgence of their ideas in second half of the century.In 1965, President Johnson inaugurated the Great Society and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act suffused public school programs with funds for sweeping education reforms. At the same time the influx of federal funding also gave rise to demands for accountability and the behavioral objectives approach of Robert F. Mager and others foreshadowed the No Child Left Behind Act passed in 2002. Against these critics eloquent spokespersons stepped forward in defense of the progressive tradition. The Open Classroom movement, led by Herb Kohl and George Dennison, recalled many of Parker's child centered reforms.The late 1960s and early 1970s saw a rise and decline in the number of progressive schools.    There were several reasons for the decline:   Demographics: As the baby boom passed, traditional classrooms were no longer as over-enrolled, reducing demand for alternatives.The economy: The oil crisis and recession made shoestring schools less viable.Times changed: With the ending of the Vietnam War, social activism waned.Co-optation: Many schools were co-opted by people who didn't believe in the original mission.Centralization: The ongoing centralization of school districtsNon-implementation: Schools failed to implement a model of shared governanceInterpersonal dynamics: Disagreement over school goals, poor group process skills, lack of critical dialogue, and fear of assertive leadershipProgressive education has been viewed as an alternative to the test-oriented instruction legislated by the No Child Left Behind educational funding act.  Alfie Kohn has been an outspoken critic of the No Child Left Behind Act and a passionate defender of the progressive tradition.Taxpayer revolts, leading to cuts in funding for public education in many states, have led to the founding of an unprecedented number of independent schools, many of which have progressive philosophies. The charter school movement has also spawned an increase in progressive programs. Most recently, public outcry against No Child Left Behind testing and teaching to the test has brought progressive education again into the limelight. Despite the variations that still exist among the progressive programs throughout the country, most progressive schools today are vitalized by these common practices:The curriculum is more flexible and is influenced by student interestTeachers are facilitators of learning who encourage students to use a wide variety of activities to learnProgressive teachers use a wider variety of materials allowing for individual and group research.Progressive teachers encourage students to learn by discoveryProgressive education programs often include the use of community resources and encourage service-learning projects.In the EastIndiaRabindranath Tagore (1861–1941) was one of the most effective practitioners of the concept of progressive education. He expanded Santiniketan, which is a small town near Bolpur in the Birbhum district of West Bengal, India, approximately 160 km north of Kolkata. He de-emphasized textbook learning in favor of varied learning resources from nature.  The emphasis here was on self-motivation rather than on discipline, and on fostering intellectual curiosity rather than competitive excellence. There were courses on a great variety of cultures, and study programs devoted to China, Japan, and the Middle East.He was of the view that education should be a "joyous exercise of our inventive and constructive energies that help us to build up character."   JapanSeikatsu tsuzurikata is a grassroots movement in Japan that has many parallels to the progressive education movement, but it developed completely independently, beginning inthe late 1920s. The Japanese progressive educational movement was one of the stepping stones to the modernization of Japan and it has resonated down to the present.

Electronic musical instrument<====>10006<====>Electronic musical instrument An electronic musical instrument is a musical instrument that produces sound using electronic circuitry.  Such an instrument sounds by outputting an electrical, electronic or digital audio signal that ultimately is plugged into a power amplifier which drives a loudspeaker, creating the sound heard by the performer and listener. An electronic instrument might include a user interface for controlling its sound, often by adjusting the pitch, frequency, or duration of each note.  A common user interface is the musical keyboard, which functions similarly to the keyboard on an acoustic piano, except that with an electronic keyboard, the keyboard itself does not make any sound. 

Electrode<====>10008<====>Electrode  An electrode is an electrical conductor used to make contact with a nonmetallic part of a circuit (e. g.  a semiconductor, an electrolyte, a vacuum or air).  The word was coined by William Whewell at the request of the scientist Michael Faraday from the Greek words elektron, meaning amber (from which the word electricity is derived), and hodos, a way.The electrophore, invented by Johan Wilcke, was an early version of an electrode used to study static electricity.  Anode and cathode in electrochemical cellsAn electrode in an electrochemical cell is referred to as either an anode or a cathode (words that were coined by William Whewell at Faraday's request). 

Epistolary novel<====>10011<====>Epistolary novel  An epistolary novel   is a novel written as a series of documents.  The usual form is letters, although diary entries, newspaper clippings and other documents are sometimes used.  Recently, electronic "documents" such as recordings and radio, blogs, and e-mails have also come into use.  The word   is derived from Latin from the Greek word ἐπιστολή epistolē, meaning a letter (see epistle). The epistolary form can add greater realism to a story, because it mimics the workings of real life.  It is thus able to demonstrate differing points of view without recourse to the device of an omniscient narrator. 

Evidence-based medicine<====>10013<====>Evidence-based medicine Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is an approach to medical practice intended to optimize decision-making by emphasizing the use of evidence from well-designed and well-conducted research.  Although all medicine based on science has some degree of empirical support, EBM goes further, classifying evidence by its epistemologic strength and requiring that only the strongest types (coming from meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials) can yield strong recommendations; weaker types (such as from case-control studies) can yield only weak recommendations.  The term was originally used to describe an approach to teaching the practice of medicine and improving decisions by individual physicians about individual patients. 

End zone<====>10016<====>End zone  The end zone is the scoring area on the field, according to gridiron-based codes of football.  It is the area between the end line and goal line bounded by the sidelines.   There are two end zones, each being on an opposite side of the field.  It is bordered on all sides by a white line indicating its beginning and end points, with orange, square pylons placed at each of the four corners as a visual aid (however, prior to around the early 1970s, flags were used instead to denote the end zone).  Canadian rule books use the terms goal area and dead line instead of end zone and end line respectively, but the latter terms are the more common in colloquial Canadian English. 

Ettore Ximenes<====>10017<====>Ettore XimenesEttore Ximenes (April 11, 1855, Palermo  – December 20, 1926, Rome) was an Italian sculptor. BiographySon of Antonio Ximenes and Giulia Tolentino, a sicilian noble woman, Ettore Ximenes initially embarked on literary studies but then took up sculpture and attended the courses at the Palermo Academy of Fine Arts.  After 1872, he continued training at the Naples Academy under Domenico Morelli  and Stanislao Lista.  He also established a close relationship with Vincenzo Gemito. He returned to Palermo in 1874 and won a competition for a four-year grant, which enabled him to study and open a studio for sculpture in Florence. 

Edsger W. Dijkstra<====>10018<====>Edsger W.  Dijkstra Edsger Wybe Dijkstra ( ; 11 May 1930 – 6 August 2002) was a Dutch systems scientist, programmer, software engineer, science essayist,  and early pioneer in computing science.   He held the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in Computer Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin from 1984 until his retirement in 1999.  A theoretical physicist by training, Dijkstra worked as a programmer at the Mathematisch Centrum (Amsterdam) from 1952 to 1962.  He was a professor of mathematics at the Eindhoven University of Technology (1962–1984) and a research fellow at the Burroughs Corporation (1973–1984). 

Educational perennialism<====>10021<====>Educational perennialism Educational perennialism is a normative educational philosophy.  Perennialists believe that one should teach the things that are of everlasting pertinence to all people everywhere, and that the emphasis should be on principles, not facts.  Since people are human, one should teach first about humans, rather than machines or techniques and liberal rather than vocational topics. Although perennialism may appear similar to essentialism, perennialism focuses first on personal development, while essentialism focuses first on essential skills.  Essentialist curricula thus tend to be much more vocational and fact-based, and far less liberal and principle-based.  Both philosophies are typically considered to be teacher-centered, as opposed to student-centered philosophies of education such as progressivism. 

MDMA<====>10024<====>MDMA3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as ecstasy (E), is a psychoactive drug used primarily as a recreational drug.  The desired recreational effects include increased empathy, euphoria, and heightened sensations. When taken by mouth, effects begin after 30–45 minutes and last 3–6 hours.  , MDMA has no accepted medical uses.   Adverse effects of MDMA use include addiction, memory problems, paranoia, difficulty sleeping, teeth grinding, blurred vision, sweating, and a rapid heartbeat.   Use may also lead to depression and fatigue.   Deaths have been reported due to increased body temperature and dehydration. 

Flag of Europe<====>10025<====>Flag of Europe    The European Flag is an official symbol of two separate organisations—the Council of Europe (CoE) and the European Union (EU).  It consists of a circle of  twelve five-pointed yellow (or) stars on a blue (azure) field.  The flag was designed in 1955, and officially launched later that year by the Council of Europe as a symbol for the whole of Europe.   The Council of Europe urged it to be adopted by other European organisations, and in 1985 the European Communities (EC) adopted it. The EU inherited the flag's use when it was formed in 1993, being the successor organisation to the EC. 

Anthem of Europe<====>10026<====>Anthem of Europe    "Anthem of Europe" is the anthem of the Council of Europe and the European Union.    It is based on "Ode to Joy" from the final movement of Beethoven's 9th Symphony composed in 1823, and is played on official occasions by both organisations. History Friedrich Schiller wrote the poem "An die Freude" ("To Joy") in 1785 as a "celebration of the brotherhood of man".   In later life, the poet was contemptuous of this popularity and dismissed the poem as typical of "the bad taste of the age" in which it had been written. 

Timeline of the evolutionary history of life<====>10029<====>Timeline of the evolutionary history of life    This timeline of the evolutionary history of life represents the current scientific theory outlining the major events during the development of life on planet Earth.  In biology, evolution is any change across successive generations in the heritable characteristics of biological populations.  Evolutionary processes give rise to diversity at every level of biological organization, from kingdoms to species, and individual organisms and molecules, such as DNA and proteins.  The similarities between all present day organisms indicate the presence of a common ancestor from which all known species, living and extinct, have diverged through the process of evolution. 

Edmund Burke<====>10030<====>Edmund BurkeEdmund Burke ( ; 12 January  [ NS ]  1730  9 July 1797) was an Irish   statesman born in Dublin, as well as an author, orator, political theorist and philosopher, who after moving to London in 1750 served as a member of parliament (MP) between 1766 and 1794 in the House of Commons with the Whig Party. Burke was a proponent of underpinning virtues with manners in society and of the importance of religion in moral life.    These views were expressed in his A Vindication of Natural Society. 

Early music<====>10033<====>Early music  Early music is music, especially Western art music, composed prior to the Classical era.  Michael Kennedy, "Early Music"", in The Oxford Dictionary of Music, second revised edition, Associate Editor Joyce Bourne.  Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994.   .    The term generally comprises Medieval music (500–1400) and Renaissance music (1400–1600), but can also include Baroque music (1600–1760), and, according to some authorities such as Kennedy (who excludes Baroque),  Ancient music (before 500 AD).  According to the UK's National Centre for Early Music, the term "early music" refers to both a repertory (European music written between 1250 and 1750 embracing Medieval, Renaissance and the Baroque) – and a historically informed approach to the performance of that music. 

Elfenland<====>10035<====>Elfenland   Elfenland is a German-style board game designed by Alan R.  Moon and published by Amigo Spiele in German and Rio Grande Games in English in 1998. It is originally based on his earlier game Elfenroads (published by White Wind), but since Elfenroads took about four hours for a game, the play was simplified to reduce the time closer to an hour, making it appeal more as a family game.  It won the Spiel des Jahres award in 1998 and won the third place Deutscher Spiele Preis award in 1998. GameplayThe game is played by 2–6 players, with 4–5 making for the best game. 

Euroscepticism<====>10037<====>Euroscepticism    Euroscepticism (also known as EU-scepticism)    means criticism of the European Union (EU) and European integration.  It can also mean opposition to and total rejection of the EU (anti-EU-ism) and integration.   The main sources of Euroscepticism have been notions that integration weakens national sovereignty and the nation state; that there is a democratic deficit in the European Union; that the EU is too bureaucratic;   that it encourages high levels of migration; or perceptions that it is a neoliberal organisation which benefits the business elite at the expense of the working class. 

Estimator<====>10043<====>Estimator In statistics, an estimator is a rule for calculating an estimate of a given quantity based on observed data: thus the rule (the estimator), the quantity of interest (the estimand) and its result (the estimate) are distinguished. There are point and interval estimators.  The point estimators yield single-valued results, although this includes the possibility of single vector-valued results and results that can be expressed as a single function.  This is in contrast to an interval estimator, where the result would be a range of plausible values (or vectors or functions). Estimation theory is concerned with the properties of estimators; that is, with defining properties that can be used to compare different estimators (different rules for creating estimates) for the same quantity, based on the same data. 

Emerald<====>10045<====>Emerald  Emerald is a gemstone and a variety of the mineral beryl (Be 3 Al 2 (SiO 3 ) 6 ) colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium.  Hurlbut, Cornelius S.  Jr.  and Kammerling, Robert C.  (1991) Gemology, John Wiley & Sons, New York, p.  203,  .   Beryl has a hardness of 7. 5–8 on the Mohs scale.   Most emeralds are highly included,  so their toughness (resistance to breakage) is classified as generally poor.  Emerald is a cyclosilicate. EtymologyThe word "emerald" is derived (via   and  ), from Vulgar Latin: esmaralda/esmaraldus, a variant of Latin smaragdus, which originated in   (smaragdos; "green gem"). 

Erie Canal<====>10046<====>Erie Canal   The Erie Canal is a canal in New York that is part of the east–west, cross-state route of the New York State Canal System (formerly known as the New York State Barge Canal).  Originally, it ran   from Albany, on the Hudson River, to Buffalo, at Lake Erie.  It was built to create a navigable water route from New York City and the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes.  When completed in 1825, it was the second longest canal in the world (after the Grand Canal in China) and greatly affected the development and economy of New York, New York City, and the United States. 

Ethanol<====>10048<====>EthanolEthanol, also called alcohol, ethyl alcohol, and drinking alcohol, is a chemical compound, a simple alcohol with the chemical formula  .  Its formula can be written also as  − −  or  −  (an ethyl group linked to a hydroxyl group), and is often abbreviated as EtOH.  Ethanol is a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid with a slight characteristic odor.  It is a psychoactive substance and is the principal type of alcohol found in alcoholic drinks. Ethanol is naturally produced by the fermentation of sugars by yeasts or via petrochemical processes, and is most commonly consumed as a popular recreational drug. 

Eric Clapton<====>10049<====>Eric Clapton    Eric Patrick Clapton,   (born   1945), is an English rock and blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter.  He is the only three-time inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: once as a solo artist and separately as a member of the Yardbirds and of Cream.  Clapton has been referred to as one of the most important and influential guitarists of all time.Clapton ranked second in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"  and fourth in Gibson's "Top 50 Guitarists of All Time".

Etiology<====>10055<====>Etiology  Etiology ( ; alternatively aetiology or ætiology) is the study of causation, or origination.  The word is derived from the Greek  , aitiología, "giving a reason for" ( , aitía, "cause"; and  ,  ).   The word is most commonly used in medical and philosophical theories, where it is used to refer to the study of why things occur, or even the reasons behind the way that things act, and is used in philosophy, physics, psychology, government, geography, spatial analysis, medicine, theology, and biology in reference to the causes of various phenomena. An etiological myth is a myth intended to explain a name or create a mythic history for a place or family, an origin story. 

Empirical formula<====>10065<====>Empirical formula In chemistry, the empirical formula of a chemical compound is the simplest positive integer ratio of atoms present in a compound.   A simple example of this concept is that the empirical formula of sulfur monoxide, or SO, would simply be SO, as is the empirical formula of disulfur dioxide, S 2 O 2 .  This means that sulfur monoxide and disulfur dioxide, both compounds of sulfur and oxygen, will have the same empirical formula.  However, their chemical formulas, which express the number of atoms in each molecule of a chemical compound, may not be the same. 

Episcopal polity<====>10067<====>Episcopal polity   An episcopal polity is a hierarchical form of church governance ("ecclesiastical polity") in which the chief local authorities are called bishops.  (The word "bishop" derives, via the British Latin and Vulgar Latin term *ebiscopus/*biscopus, from the Ancient Greek   epískopos meaning "overseer". ) It is the structure used by many of the major Christian Churches and denominations, such as the  Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Church of the East, Anglican and Lutheran churches or denominations, and other churches founded independently from these lineages. Churches with an episcopal polity are governed by bishops, practicing their authorities in the dioceses and conferences or synods. 

East Slavic languages<====>10070<====>East Slavic languages The East Slavic languages constitute one of three regional subgroups of Slavic languages, currently spoken in Eastern Europe.  It is the group with the largest numbers of speakers, far out-numbering the Western and Southern Slavic groups.  The existing East Slavic languages are Belarusian, Russian and Ukrainian;  Rusyn is considered to be either a separate language or a dialect of Ukrainian.  The East Slavic languages descend from a common predecessor, the language of the medieval Kievan Rus' (9th to 13th centuries). All these languages use the Cyrillic script, but with particular modifications. ClassificationDifferentiationThe East Slavic territory shows a definite linguistic continuum with many transitional dialects.

Epicurus<====>10073<====>Epicurus Epicurus ( ;   , "ally, comrade"; 341–270 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher who founded a school of philosophy now called Epicureanism.  Only a few fragments and letters of Epicurus's 300 written works remain.  Much of what is known about Epicurean philosophy derives from later followers and commentators. For Epicurus, the purpose of philosophy was to attain the happy, tranquil life, characterized by ataraxia—peace and freedom from fear—and aponia—the absence of pain—and by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends.  He taught that the root of all human neurosis was death denial, and the tendency for human beings to assume that death will be horrific and painful, which he claimed causes unnecessary anxiety, selfish self-protective behaviors, and hypocrisy. 

Epitaph<====>10074<====>Epitaph  An epitaph (from Greek   epitaphios "a funeral oration" from ἐπί epi "at, over" and τάφος taphos "tomb")   is a short text honoring a deceased person.  Strictly speaking, it refers to text that is inscribed on a tombstone or plaque, but it may also be used in a figurative sense.  Some epitaphs are specified by the person themselves before their death, while others are chosen by those responsible for the burial.   An epitaph may be written in prose or in poem verse; poets have been known to compose their own epitaphs prior to their death, as did William Shakespeare. 

Epigram<====>10075<====>Epigram  An epigram is a brief, interesting, memorable, and sometimes surprising or satirical statement.  The word is derived from the   epigramma "inscription" from ἐπιγράφειν epigraphein "to write on, to inscribe",  and the literary device has been employed for over two millennia. The presence of wit or sarcasm tends to distinguish non-poetic epigrams from aphorisms and adages, which may lack them. Ancient GreekThe Greek tradition of epigrams began as poems inscribed on votive offerings at sanctuaries including statues of athletes and on funerary monuments, for example "Go tell it to the Spartans, passersby. . . ". 

El Cid<====>10076<====>El Cid  Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar (  1099) was a Castilian nobleman and military leader in medieval Spain.  The Moors called him El Cid, which meant "the Lord" (probably from the original Arabic as-Sayyid, السَیِّد), and the Christians, El Campeador, which stood for Outstanding Warrior or  The one who stands out in the battlefield.  He was born in Vivar, a town near the city of Burgos.  After his death he became Castile's celebrated national hero and the protagonist of the most significant medieval Spanish epic poem, El Cantar de Mio Cid.    Born a member of the minor nobility, El Cid was brought up at the court of King Ferdinand the Great and served Ferdinand's son, Sancho II of León and Castile. 

Enjambment<====>10078<====>EnjambmentIn poetry, enjambment (  or  ; from the French enjambement)    is incomplete syntax at the end of a line;    the meaning runs over from one poetic line to the next, without terminal punctuation.  Lines without enjambment are end-stopped. In reading, the delay of meaning creates a tension that is released when the word or phrase that completes the syntax is encountered (called the rejet);  the tension arises from the "mixed message" produced both by the pause of the line-end, and the suggestion to continue provided by the incomplete meaning.  Preminger 359  In spite of the apparent contradiction between rhyme, which heightens closure, and enjambment, which delays it, the technique is compatible with rhymed verse. 

European Convention on Nationality<====>10080<====>European Convention on NationalityThe European Convention on Nationality (E. T. S.  No.  166 ) was signed in Strasbourg on 6 November 1997.  It is a comprehensive convention of the Council of Europe dealing with the law of nationality.  The Convention is open for signature by the member States of the Council of Europe and the non-member States which have participated in its elaboration and for accession by other non-member States.  The Convention came into force on 1 March 2000 after ratification by 3 countries.  As at 6 March 2014, the Convention has been signed by 29 countries, but has been ratified by only 20 of those countries. 

English orthography<====>10081<====>English orthographyEnglish orthography is the system of writing conventions used to represent spoken English in written form   that allows readers to connect spelling to sound to meaning.  Like the orthography of most world languages, English orthography has a broad degree of standardization.  However, unlike with most languages, there are multiple ways to spell nearly every phoneme (sound), and most letters also have multiple pronunciations depending on their position in a word and the context.  Several orthographic mistakes are common even among native speakers.   This is mainly due to the large number of words that have been borrowed from a large number of other languages throughout the history of the English language, without successful attempts at complete spelling reforms. 

Æthelred the Unready<====>10083<====>Æthelred the Unready Æthelred II (Old English: Æþelræd,  ; Different spellings of this king’s name most commonly found in modern texts are "Ethelred" and "Æthelred" (or "Aethelred"), the latter being closer to the original Old English form Æþelræd.     966 – 23 April 1016), known as the Unready, was King of the English from 978 to 1013 and again from 1014 until his death.  His epithet does not derive from the modern word " ", but rather from the Old English unræd (meaning "poorly advised"); it is a pun on his name, which means "well advised". Æthelred was the son of King Edgar and Queen Ælfthryth. 

Edward Elgar<====>10085<====>Edward Elgar  Sir Edward William Elgar, 1st Baronet   (2 June 1857 – 23 February 1934) was an English composer, many of whose works have entered the British and international classical concert repertoire.  Among his best-known compositions are orchestral works including the Enigma Variations, the Pomp and Circumstance Marches, concertos for violin and cello, and two symphonies.  He also composed choral works, including The Dream of Gerontius, chamber music and songs.  He was appointed Master of the King's Musick  in 1924. Although Elgar is often regarded as a typically English composer, most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe. 

European Investment Fund<====>10086<====>European Investment Fund The European Investment Fund (EIF), established in 1994, is a European Union agency for the provision of finance to SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), headquartered in Luxembourg.It does not lend money to SMEs directly; rather it provides finance through private banks and funds.

European Currency Unit<====>10087<====>European Currency Unit    The European Currency Unit (₠ or ECU,  ) was a basket of the currencies of the European Community member states, used as the unit of account of the European Community before being replaced by the euro on 1 January 1999, at parity.   The ECU itself replaced the European Unit of Account, also at parity, on 13 March 1979.  The European Exchange Rate Mechanism attempted to minimize fluctuations between member state currencies and the ECU.  The ECU was also used in some international financial transactions, where its advantage was that securities denominated in ECUs provided investors with the opportunity for foreign diversification without reliance on the currency of a single country. 

Eastern Caribbean dollar<====>10088<====>Eastern Caribbean dollar The Eastern Caribbean dollar (symbol: $; code: XCD) is the currency of all seven full members and one associate member of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS).  It has existed since 1965, being the successor to the British West Indies dollar, and it is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign $ or, alternatively, EC$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies.  The EC$ is subdivided into 100 cents.  It has been pegged to the United States dollar since 7 July 1976, and the exchange rate is US$1 = EC$2. 70.    CirculationSix of the states using the EC$ are independent states: Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. 

Erythromycin<====>10090<====>Erythromycin   Erythromycin is an antibiotic useful for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections.   This includes respiratory tract infections, skin infections, chlamydia infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and syphilis.   It may also be used during pregnancy to prevent Group B streptococcal infection in the newborn.   Erythromycin may be used to improve delayed stomach emptying.   It can be given intravenously and by mouth.   An eye ointment is routinely recommended after delivery to prevent eye infections in the newborn.   Common side effects include abdominal cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. 

Environmental law<====>10091<====>Environmental law  Environmental law, also known as environmental and natural resources law, is a collective term describing the network of treaties, statutes, regulations, common and customary laws addressing the effects of human activity on the natural environment.  The core environmental law regimes address environmental pollution.  A related but distinct set of regulatory regimes, now strongly influenced by environmental legal principles, focus on the management of specific natural resources, such as forests, minerals, or fisheries.  Other areas, such as environmental impact assessment, may not fit neatly into either category, but are nonetheless important components of environmental law. 

Eurostar<====>10093<====>Eurostar    Eurostar is a high-speed railway service connecting London with Avignon, Brussels, Lille, Lyon, Marseille and Paris.  All its trains traverse the Channel Tunnel between the United Kingdom and France, owned and operated separately by Getlink. The London terminus is St Pancras International, the other British calling points being Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International in Kent.  Calling points in France are Calais-Fréthun and Lille-Europe, with trains to Paris terminating at Gare du Nord.  Trains to Belgium terminate at Midi/Zuid station in Brussels.  In addition, there are limited services from London to Disneyland Paris at Marne-la-Vallée – Chessy, direct services to southern France (Lyon, Avignon and Marseille) from May to September  (launched on 1 May 2015), and seasonal direct services to the French Alps in winter (December to April). 

Equinox<====>10100<====>EquinoxAn equinox is commonly regarded as the moment when the plane of Earth's equator passes through the center of the Sun's disk,    which occurs twice each year, around 20 March and 23 September.  This simplified, but incorrect, understanding of Earth's orbital motion can lead to errors of up to 69 seconds from the actual time of equinox. The instants of the equinoxes are currently defined to occur when the ecliptic longitude of the Sun is either 0° or 180°.   As the true motion of the Earth in its orbit oscillates around the center of mass of the Terra–Luna binary, there are tiny (up to 1¼ arcsecond) variations of the Sun's ecliptic latitude (discussed in section below) that may mean the Sun's center is not precisely over the equator at the moment of equinox. 

Eugene Wigner<====>10101<====>Eugene Wigner   Eugene Paul "E.  P. " Wigner ( ; November 17, 1902 – January 1, 1995), was a Hungarian-American theoretical physicist, engineer and mathematician.  He received half of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963 "for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles, particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles".    A graduate of the Technical University of Berlin, Wigner worked as an assistant to Karl Weissenberg and Richard Becker at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, and David Hilbert at the University of Göttingen. 

Electroweak interaction<====>10103<====>Electroweak interaction In particle physics, the electroweak interaction is the unified description of two of the four known  fundamental interactions of nature: electromagnetism and the weak interaction.  Although these two forces appear very different at everyday low energies, the theory models them as two different aspects of the same force.  Above the unification energy, on the order of 246 GeV,  they would merge into a single electroweak force.  Thus, if the universe is hot enough (approximately 10 15  K, a temperature exceeded until shortly after the Big Bang), then the electromagnetic force and weak force merge into a combined electroweak force. 

Erasmus Reinhold<====>10105<====>Erasmus Reinhold Erasmus Reinhold (October 22, 1511 – February 19, 1553) was a German astronomer and mathematician, considered to be the most influential astronomical pedagogue of his generation.   He was born and died in Saalfeld, Saxony. He was educated, under Jacob Milich, at the University of Wittenberg, where he was first elected dean and later became rector.  In 1536 he was appointed professor of higher mathematics by Philipp Melanchthon.  In contrast to the limited modern definition, "mathematics" at the time also included applied mathematics, especially astronomy.  His colleague, Georg Joachim Rheticus, also studied at Wittenberg and was appointed professor of lower mathematics in 1536. 

Earthquake<====>10106<====>EarthquakeAn earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth, resulting from the sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves.  Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt to those violent enough to toss people around and destroy whole cities.  The seismicity or seismic activity of an area refers to the frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time. At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and sometimes displacement of the ground. 

Emperor of Japan<====>10110<====>Emperor of Japan    The Emperor of Japan is the head of the Imperial Family and the traditional head of state of Japan.  According to the 1947 constitution, he is "the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people" and he has "no powers related to government".  Historically, he was also the highest authority of the Shinto religion.  In Japanese, the Emperor is called  , which translates to "heavenly sovereign".  In English, the use of the term   for the Emperor was once common, but is now considered obsolete. 

Emperor<====>10111<====>Emperor    An emperor (through Old French empereor from Latin imperator ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm.   Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (empress consort), mother (empress dowager), or a woman who rules in her own right (empress regnant).  Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings.  In Europe the title of Emperor has been used since the Middle Ages, considered in those times equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of the Catholic part of Western Europe. 

Egalitarianism<====>10113<====>EgalitarianismEgalitarianism ( ) – or equalitarianism   – is a school of thought that prioritizes equality for all people.   According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Egalitarian doctrines maintain that all humans are equal in fundamental worth or social status.  Arneson Richard,  "Egalitarianism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2002. ) Web:    According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the term has two distinct definitions in modern English:  either as a political doctrine that all people should be treated as equals and have the same political, economic, social and civil rights;  or as a social philosophy advocating the removal of economic inequalities among people, economic egalitarianism, or the decentralization of power. 

Expert witness<====>10115<====>Expert witness   An expert witness, in England, Wales and the United States, is a person whose opinion by virtue of education, training, certification, skills or experience, is accepted by the judge as an expert.  The judge may consider the witness's specialized (scientific, technical or other) opinion about evidence or about facts before the court within the expert's area of expertise, referred to as an "expert opinion".   Expert witnesses may also deliver "expert evidence" within the area of their expertise.   Their testimony may be rebutted by testimony from other experts or by other evidence or facts. 

Endocytosis<====>10116<====>Endocytosis Endocytosis is a form of active transport in which a cell transports molecules (such as proteins) into the cell (  + cytosis) by engulfing them in an energy-using process.  Endocytosis and its counterpart, exocytosis, are used by all cells because most chemical substances important to them are large polar molecules that cannot pass through the hydrophobic plasma or cell membrane by passive means. Endocytosis includes pinocytosis (cell drinking) and phagocytosis (cell eating). HistoryThe term was proposed by De Duve in 1963.   Phagocytosis was discovered by Élie Metchnikoff in 1882.  Endocytosis pathwaysEndocytosis pathways can be subdivided into four categories: namely, receptor-mediated endocytosis (also known as clathrin-mediated endocytosis), caveolae, macropinocytosis, and phagocytosis.

Expert system<====>10136<====>Expert systemIn artificial intelligence, an expert system is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert.    Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through bodies of knowledge, represented mainly as if–then rules rather than through conventional procedural code.   The first expert systems were created in the 1970s and then proliferated in the 1980s.Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of artificial intelligence (AI) software.   An expert system is divided into two subsystems: the inference engine and the knowledge base.

Oxford was heir to the second oldest earldom in the kingdom, a court favourite for a time, a sought-after patron of the arts, and noted by his contemporaries as a lyric poet and court playwright, but his reckless and volatile temperament precluded him from attaining any courtly or governmental responsibility and contributed to the dissipation of his estate.   Since the 1920s he has been among the most popular alternative candidates proposed for the authorship of Shakespeare's works. 

Erinyes<====>10141<====>Erinyes   In Greek mythology the Erinyes ( ; sing.  Erinys  ;   , pl.  of  , Erinys),  also known as the Furies, were female chthonic deities of vengeance; they were sometimes referred to as "infernal goddesses" ( ).  A formulaic oath in the Iliad invokes them as "the Erinyes, that under earth take vengeance on men, whosoever hath sworn a false oath".   Walter Burkert suggests they are "an embodiment of the act of self-cursing contained in the oath".   They correspond to the Dirae in Roman mythology.   The Roman writer Maurus Servius Honoratus wrote that they are called "Eumenides" in hell, "Furiae" on earth, and "Dirae" in heaven.

East Coast Swing<====>10147<====>East Coast Swing East Coast Swing (ECS) is a form of social partner dance.  It belongs to the group of swing dances.  It is danced under fast swing music, including rock and roll and boogie-woogie. Yerrington and Outland equated East Coast Swing to the New Yorker in 1961.  Originally known as "Eastern Swing" by Arthur Murray Studios, the name East Coast Swing became more common between 1975 and 1980.  HistoryThe dance was created by dance studios including the Arthur Murray dance studios in the 1940s, based on the Lindy Hop.  Lindy Hop was felt by dance studios to be both too difficult and too unstructured to teach to beginning dancers, but there was market demand for training in Swing Dance.

"The Birth Dates of John Colet and Erasmus of Rotterdam: Fresh Documentary Evidence," Renaissance Quarterly, The University of Chicago Press on behalf of the Renaissance Society of America, Vol.  32, No.  1 (Spring, 1979), pp.  73–76; www. jstor. org   – 12 July 1536), known as Erasmus or Erasmus of Rotterdam, Erasmus was his baptismal name, given after St.  Erasmus of Formiae.  Desiderius was a self-adopted additional name, which he used from 1496.  The Roterodamus was a scholarly name meaning "from Rotterdam", though the Latin genitive would be Roterdamensis. 

Encyclopedia Brown<====>10153<====>Encyclopedia Brown   Encyclopedia Brown is a series of books featuring the adventures of boy detective Leroy Brown, nicknamed "Encyclopedia" for his intelligence and range of knowledge.   The series of 29 children's novels was written (one co-written) by Donald J.  Sobol, with the first book published in 1963 and the last novel published posthumously, in 2012.   The Encyclopedia Brown series has spawned a comic strip, a TV series, compilation books of puzzles and games, and a feature film is in development . Style Each book in the Encyclopedia Brown mystery series is self-contained in that the reader is not required to have read earlier books in order to understand the stories. 

Empire<====>10158<====>Empire  An empire is defined as "an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former  British Empire, Spanish Empire, French Empire, Persian Empire, Russian Empire, German Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire".   An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire.  Aside from the more formal usage, the term "empire" can also be used to refer to a large-scale business enterprise (e. 

Final Solution<====>10160<====>Final Solution   The Final Solution ( ) or the Final Solution to the Jewish Question ( ,  ) was a Nazi plan for the extermination of the Jews during World War II.  The “Final Solution of the Jewish Question” was the official code name for the murder of all Jews within reach, which was not limited to the European continent.    This policy of deliberate and systematic genocide starting across German-occupied Europe was formulated in procedural and geo-political terms by Nazi leadership in January 1942 at the Wannsee Conference near Berlin,    and culminated in the Holocaust which saw the killing of 90 percent of Jewish Poles,    and two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe. 

Eurystheus<====>10164<====>EurystheusIn Greek mythology, Eurystheus ( ;   meaning "broad strength" in folk etymology and pronounced  ) was king of Tiryns, one of three Mycenaean strongholds in the Argolid, although other authors including Homer and Euripides cast him as ruler of Argos. ga : EoraistéasFamilyEurystheus was the son of  Sthenelus and the "victorious horsewoman" Nicippe, and he was a grandson of the hero Perseus, as was his opponent Heracles.  He was married to Antimache,  daughter of Amphidamas. MythologyLabors of Heracles In the contest of wills between Hera and Zeus over whose candidate would be hero, fated to defeat the remaining creatures representing an old order and bring about the reign of the Twelve Olympians, Eurystheus was Hera's candidate and Heracles – though his name implies that at one archaic stage of myth-making he had carried "Hera's fame" – was the candidate of Zeus. 

Effects unit<====>10165<====>Effects unit An effects unit or pedal is an electronic or digital device that alters how a musical instrument or other audio source sounds.  In the 2010s, most effects use solid-state electronics and/or computer chips.  Some vintage effects units from the 1930s to the 1970s and modern reissues of these effects use mechanical components as well (e. g. , Leslie rotating speaker, spring reverb, and tape recorder-based echo effects) or vacuum tubes.  Some effects subtly "color" a sound, such as a reverb unit used on a low setting, while others transform it dramatically, such as a distortion pedal used with electric guitar, with the overdrive set to its maximum level. 

Enron<====>10166<====>Enron   Enron Corporation was an American energy, commodities, and services company based in Houston, Texas.  It was founded in 1985 as a merger between Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth, both relatively small regional companies.  Before its bankruptcy on December 2, 2001, Enron employed approximately 20,000 staff and was one of the world's major electricity, natural gas, communications and pulp and paper companies, with claimed revenues of nearly $101 billion during 2000.   Fortune named Enron "America's Most Innovative Company" for six consecutive years. At the end of 2001, it was revealed that its reported financial condition was sustained by institutionalized, systematic, and creatively planned accounting fraud, known since as the Enron scandal. 

Eusebius of Alexandria<====>10168<====>Eusebius of Alexandria  Eusebius of Alexandria is an author to whom certain extant homilies are attributed. BiographyNothing is known of the author.  In all events, he was not a patriarch of Alexandria, as is affirmed in an early biography,   written by one Johannes, a notary, and stating that Eusebius was called by Cyril to be his successor in the episcopate. There has been much dispute regarding the details of his life and the age in which he lived.  Galland (Vet.  Patr.  Biblioth. , VIII, 23) says: "de Eusebio qui vulgo dicitur episcopus Alexandræ incerta omnia" (Concerning Eusebius, commonly called bishop of Alexandria there is nothing sure). 

Eusebius of Angers<====>10169<====>Eusebius of AngersEusebius (Bruno) of Angers (died September 1, 1081) was bishop of Angers, France.  He first appears in the historical record as bishop of Angers at the synod of Rheims in 1049, and for a long time had been an adherent of Berengar's doctrine of the Lord's Supper.  As such he was regarded by Berengar himself and by his opponents Dietwin of Liege (Theodwin), Durand of Troarne, and Humbert of Mourmoutiers.  But when he recognized the strength of the opposition, he favored a compromise; at any rate he advised Berengar is 1054 to swear to the formula presented to him. 

Eusebius<====>10172<====>Eusebius  Eusebius of Caesarea ( ;  , Eusébios tés Kaisareías;   260/265 – 339/340), also known as Eusebius Pamphili (from the  , was a historian of Christianity, exegete, and Christian polemicist.  He became the bishop of Caesarea Maritima about 314 AD.  Together with Pamphilus, he was a scholar of the Biblical canon and is regarded as an extremely learned Christian of his time.   He wrote Demonstrations of the Gospel, Preparations for the Gospel, and On Discrepancies between the Gospels, studies of the Biblical text.  As "Father of Church History" (not to be confused with the title of Church Father), he produced the Ecclesiastical History, On the Life of Pamphilus, the Chronicle and On the Martyrs. 

Empiricism<====>10174<====>Empiricism Empiricism is a theory that states that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience.    It is one of several views of  epistemology, the study of human knowledge, along with rationalism and skepticism.  Empiricism emphasizes the role of empirical evidence in the formation of ideas, over the idea of innate ideas or traditions;  empiricists may argue however that traditions (or customs) arise due to relations of previous sense experiences.  Empiricism in the philosophy of science emphasizes evidence, especially as discovered in experiments.  It is a fundamental part of the scientific method that all hypotheses and theories must be tested against observations of the natural world rather than resting solely on a priori reasoning, intuition, or revelation. 

Estampie<====>10175<====>Estampie The estampie ( , Occitan and  ,  ) is a medieval dance and musical form which was a popular instrumental and vocal form in the 13th and 14th centuries.  The name was also applied to poetry  .  Musical formThe estampie is similar in form to the lai, consisting of a succession of repeated sections  .  According to Johannes de Grocheio, there were both vocal and instrumental estampies (for which he used the Latin calque "stantipes"), which differed somewhat in form, in that the vocal estampie begins with a refrain, which is repeated at the end of each verse  . 

Experimental cancer treatment<====>10176<====>Experimental cancer treatment Experimental cancer treatments are medical therapies intended or claimed to treat cancer by improving on, supplementing or replacing conventional methods (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy). The entries listed below vary between theoretical therapies to unproven controversial therapies.  Many of these treatments are alleged to help against only specific forms of cancer.  It is not a list of treatments widely available at hospitals. Studying treatments for cancer The twin goals of research are to determine whether the treatment actually works (called efficacy) and whether it is sufficiently safe.  Regulatory processes attempt to balance the potential benefits with the potential harms, so that people given the treatment are more likely to benefit from it than to be harmed by it. 

Environmental movement in the United States<====>10183<====>Environmental movement in the United StatesIn the United States today, the organized environmental movement is represented by a wide range of organizations sometimes called non-governmental organizations or NGOs.  These organizations exist on local, national, and international scales.  Environmental NGOs vary widely in political views and in the amount they seek to influence the environmental policy of the United States and other governments.  The environmental movement today consists of both large national groups and also many smaller local groups with local concerns.  Some resemble the old U. S.  conservation movement - whose modern expression is The Nature Conservancy, Audubon Society and National Geographic Society - American organizations with a worldwide influence. 

Environmentalist<====>10184<====>Environmentalist An environmentalist is a supporter of the goals of the environmental movement, "a political and ethical movement that seeks to improve and protect the quality of the natural environment through changes to environmentally harmful human activities".  An environmentalist is engaged in or believes in the philosophy of environmentalism.Environmentalists are sometimes referred to using informal or derogatory terms such as "greenie" and "tree-hugger".

Eastern Orthodox Church<====>10186<====>Eastern Orthodox Church The Eastern Orthodox Church,  also known as the Orthodox Church,    or officially as the Orthodox Catholic Church,  is the second-largest Christian Church, with over 250 million members.   As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history and culture of Eastern Europe, Greece (including Anatolia), the Caucasus, and the Near East.   A communion of autocephalous churches (″jurisdictions″, or national churches), each typically governed by its own Holy Synod, its bishops are equal by virtue of ordination, with doctrines summarised in the Nicene Creed. 

Eusebius of Nicomedia<====>10190<====>Eusebius of Nicomedia Eusebius of Nicomedia (died 341) was the man who baptised Constantine the Great.  He was a bishop of Berytus (modern-day Beirut) in Phoenicia.  He was later translated the see of Nicomedia, where the imperial court resided.  He lived finally in Constantinople from 338 up to his death. Influence in the Imperial family and the Imperial courtDistantly related to the imperial family of Constantine, he owed his progression from a less significant Levantine bishopric to the most important episcopal see to his influence at court, and the great power he wielded in the Church was derived from that source. 

Edo<====>10191<====>Edo , also romanized as Jedo, Yedo or Yeddo, is the former name of Tokyo.   It was the seat of power for the Tokugawa shogunate, which ruled Japan from 1603 to 1868.  During this period, it grew to become one of the largest cities in the world and home to an urban culture centered on the notion of a "floating world".  Sansom, George.  A History of Japan: 1615–1867, p.  114.  History From the establishment of the Tokugawa bakufu headquarters at Edo, the town became the de facto capital and center of political power, although Kyoto remained the formal capital of the country. 

Explosive material<====>10192<====>Explosive material  An explosive material, also called an explosive, is a reactive substance that contains a great amount of potential energy that can produce an explosion if released suddenly, usually accompanied by the production of light, heat, sound, and pressure.  An explosive charge is a measured quantity of explosive material, which may be composed of a single ingredient or a combination of two or more. The potential energy stored in an explosive material may, for example, bechemical energy, such as nitroglycerin or grain dustpressurized gas, such as a gas cylinder or aerosol cannuclear energy, such as in the fissile isotopes uranium-235 and plutonium-239Explosive materials may be categorized by the speed at which they expand. 

Enter the Dragon<====>10193<====>Enter the DragonEnter the Dragon is a 1973 Hong Kong-American martial arts action film, directed by Robert Clouse, and starring Bruce Lee, John Saxon, and Jim Kelly.   This was Bruce Lee's final film appearance before his death on 20 July 1973 at age 32.  The film was first released on 26 July 1973 in Hong Kong, six days after Lee's death. Often considered one of the greatest martial arts films of all time, in 2004 the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". 

Exothermic process<====>10201<====>Exothermic process In thermodynamics, the term exothermic process (exo- : "outside") describes a process or reaction that releases energy from the system to its surroundings, usually in the form of heat, but also in a form of light (e. g.  a spark, flame, or flash), electricity (e. g.  a battery), or sound (e. g.  explosion heard when burning hydrogen).  Its etymology stems from the Greek prefix έξω (exō, which means "outwards") and the Greek word θερμικός (thermikόs, which means "thermal").   The term exothermic was first coined by Marcellin Berthelot.  The opposite of an exothermic process is an endothermic process, one that absorbs energy in the form of heat. 

Elihu Yale<====>10204<====>Elihu Yale   Elihu Yale (5 April 1649 – 8 July 1721) was a British merchant, philanthropist and slave trader, President of the East India Company settlement in Fort St.  George, at Madras, and a benefactor of the Collegiate School in the Colony of Connecticut, which in 1718 was renamed Yale College in his honor.    LifeBorn in Boston, Massachusetts, to David Yale (1613–1690) and Ursula, he was the grandson of Ann Lloyd (1591–1659), who after the death of her first husband, Thomas Yale (1587–1619) in Chester, Cheshire, England, married Governor Theophilus Eaton (1590–1658) of New Haven Colony. 

Émile Baudot<====>10207<====>Émile Baudot  Jean-Maurice-Émile Baudot (11 September 1845 – 28 March 1903), French telegraph engineer and inventor of the first means of digital communication Baudot code, was one of the pioneers of telecommunications.   He invented a multiplexed printing telegraph system that used his code and allowed multiple transmissions over a single line.The baud unit was named after him. Early lifeBaudot was born in Magneux, Haute-Marne, France, the son of farmer Pierre Emile Baudot, who later became the mayor of Magneux.  His only formal education was at his local primary school, after which he carried out agricultural work on his father's farm before joining the French Post & Telegraph Administration as an apprentice operator in 1869. 

Economic security<====>10211<====>Economic security Economic security or financial security is the condition of having stable income or other resources to support a standard of living now and in the foreseeable future.  It includes:probable continued solvencypredictability of the future cash flow of a person or other economic entity, such as a countryemployment security or job securityFinancial security more often refers to individual and family money management and savings.    Economic security tends to include the broader effect of a society's production levels and monetary support for non-working citizens. Components of individual economic securityIn the United States, children's economic security is indicated by the income level and employment security of their families or organizations. 

Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution<====>10213<====>Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) (also known as Enhanced GPRS (EGPRS), or IMT Single Carrier (IMT-SC), or Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution) is a digital mobile phone technology that allows improved data transmission rates as a backward-compatible extension of GSM.  EDGE is considered a pre-3G radio technology and is part of ITU's 3G definition.EDGE was deployed on GSM networks beginning in 2003 – initially by Cingular (now AT&T) in the United States.  EDGE is standardized also by 3GPP as part of the GSM family. 

Eth<====>10216<====>Eth  Eth ( , uppercase: Ð, lowercase: ð; also spelled edh or eð) is a letter used in Old English, Middle English, Icelandic, Faroese (in which it is called edd), and Elfdalian.  It was also used in Scandinavia during the Middle Ages but was subsequently replaced with dh and later d.  It is often transliterated as d (and d- is rarely used as a mnemonic).   The lowercase version has been adopted to represent a voiced dental fricative in the International Phonetic Alphabet. In Old English, ð (called   by the Anglo-Saxons ) was used interchangeably with þ to represent the Old English dental fricative phoneme  , which exists in modern English phonology as the voiced and voiceless dental fricatives now spelled 'th'.

Euphrates<====>10221<====>Euphrates  The Euphrates ( ; Sumerian:   Buranuna,   Purattu,   al-Furāt,   Pǝrāt,  : Yeprat,   Perat,  ,  ) is the longest and one of the most historically important rivers of Western Asia.  Together with the Tigris, it is one of the two defining rivers of Mesopotamia (the "Land between the Rivers").  Originating in eastern Turkey, the Euphrates flows through Syria and Iraq to join the Tigris in the Shatt al-Arab, which empties into the Persian Gulf. EtymologyThe Ancient Greek form Euphrátēs ( , as if from Greek εὖ "good" and ϕράζω "I announce or declare") was adapted from Old Persian 𐎢𐎳𐎼𐎠𐎬𐎢 Ufrātu,  itself from Elamite 𒌑𒅁𒊏𒌅𒅖 ú-ip-ra-tu-iš. 

Estonian language<====>10223<====>Estonian language  Estonian (   ) is the official language of Estonia, spoken natively by about 1. 1 million people: 922,000 people in Estonia and 160,000 outside Estonia.   It belongs to the Finnic branch of the Uralic language family. ClassificationEstonian belongs to the Finnic branch of the Uralic languages, along with Finnish, Karelian, and other nearby languages.  The Uralic languages do not belong to the Indo-European languages.  Estonian is distantly related to Hungarian and to the Sami languages. Estonian has been influenced by Swedish, German (initially Middle Low German, which was the lingua franca of the Hanseatic League and spoken natively in the area known today as Estonia by a sizeable burgher community of Baltic Germans, and later, standard German), and Russian, though it is not related to them genetically. 

E-Prime<====>10224<====>E-Prime  E-Prime (short for English-Prime or English Prime , sometimes denoted É or E′) is a version of the English language that excludes all forms of the verb to be, including all conjugations, contractions and archaic forms. Some scholars advocate using E-Prime as a device to clarify thinking and strengthen writing.For example, the sentence "the film was good" could not be expressed under the rules of E-Prime, and the speaker might instead say "I liked the film", "the film made me laugh", or "the film has value".   The E-Prime versions communicate the writer's experience rather than judgment, making it harder for the writer or reader to confuse opinion with fact. 

Elliptic curve<====>10225<====>Elliptic curve  In mathematics, an elliptic curve is a plane algebraic curve defined by an equation of the form y^2 = x^3 + ax + b that is non-singular; that is, it has no cusps or self-intersections.  (When the characteristic of the coefficient field is equal to 2 or 3, the above equation is not quite general enough to comprise all non-singular cubic curves; see below for a more precise definition. )Formally, an elliptic curve is a smooth, projective, algebraic curve of genus one, on which there is a specified point O.  An elliptic curve is in fact an abelian variety – that is, it has a multiplication defined algebraically, with respect to which it is an abelian group – and O serves as the identity element. 

Equidae<====>10229<====>Equidae Equidae (sometimes known as the horse family) is the taxonomic family of horses and related animals, including the extant horses, donkeys, and zebras, and many other species known only from fossils.  All extant species are in the genus Equus.  Equidae belongs to the order Perissodactyla, which includes the extant tapirs and rhinoceros, and several extinct families. The term equid refers to any member of this family, including any equine. Evolution  The oldest known fossils assigned to Equidae date from the early Eocene, 54 million years ago.  They used to be assigned to the genus Hyracotherium, but the type species of that genus now is regarded to be not a member of this family.

ELIZA<====>10235<====>ELIZA  ELIZA is an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966    at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum.Created to demonstrate the superficiality of communication between humans and machines, Eliza simulated conversation by using a 'pattern matching' and substitution methodology that gave users an illusion of understanding on the part of the program, but had no built in framework for contextualizing events.Directives on how to interact were provided by 'scripts', written originally in MAD-Slip, which allowed ELIZA to process user inputs and engage in discourse following the rules and directions of the script. 

ELIZA effect<====>10236<====>ELIZA effectThe ELIZA effect, in computer science, is the tendency to unconsciously assume computer behaviors are analogous to human behaviors, that is anthropomorphisation. OverviewIn its specific form, the ELIZA effect refers only to "the susceptibility of people to read far more understanding than is warranted into strings of symbols — especially words — strung together by computers".A trivial example of the specific form of the Eliza effect, given by Douglas Hofstadter, involves an automated teller machine which displays the words "THANK YOU" at the end of a transaction.  A (very) casual observer might think that the machine is actually expressing gratitude; however, the machine is only printing a preprogrammed string of symbols. 

Exponentiation by squaring<====>10237<====>Exponentiation by squaringIn mathematics and computer programming, exponentiating by squaring is a general method for fast computation of large positive integer powers of a number, or more generally of an element of a semigroup, like a polynomial or a square matrix.  Some variants are commonly referred to as square-and-multiply algorithms or binary exponentiation.  These can be of quite general use, for example in modular arithmetic or powering of matrices.  For semigroups for which additive notation is commonly used, like elliptic curves used in cryptography, this method is also referred to as double-and-add. Basic methodThe method is based on the observation that, for a positive integer n, we have  x^n=   \begin{cases}x \, ( x^{2})^{\frac{n - 1}{2}}, & \mbox{if } n \mbox{ is odd} \\(x^{2})^{\frac{n}{2}} , & \mbox{if } n \mbox{ is even}. 

Exon<====>10238<====>Exon  An exon is any part of a gene that will encode a part of the final mature RNA produced by that gene after introns have been removed by RNA splicing.  The term exon refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and to the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts.  In RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons are covalently joined to one another as part of generating the mature messenger RNA.  Just as the entire set of genes for a species constitutes the genome, the entire set of exons constitutes the exome. HistoryThe term exon derives from the expressed region and was coined by American biochemist Walter Gilbert in 1978: "The notion of the cistron… must be replaced by that of a transcription unit containing regions which will be lost from the mature messenger which I suggest we call introns (for intragenic regions) alternating with regions which will be expressed exons. 

Exxon<====>10239<====>Exxon    Exxon   was the brand name of oil and natural resources company Exxon Corporation, prior to 1972 known as Standard Oil Company of New Jersey.  In 1999, Exxon Corporation merged with Mobil to form ExxonMobil.  The Exxon brand is still used by ExxonMobil's downstream operations as a brand for certain of its gas stations, motor fuel and related products (the highest concentration of which are located in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states).  Standard Oil Company of New Jersey was one of the Seven Sisters that dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the 1970s. 

Exxon Valdez oil spill<====>10243<====>Exxon Valdez oil spill  DISPLAYTITLE The Exxon Valdez oil spill occurred in Prince William Sound, Alaska, March 24, 1989, when Exxon Valdez, an oil tanker owned by Exxon Shipping Company, bound for Long Beach, California, struck Prince William Sound's Bligh Reef at 12:04 am   local time and spilled   of crude oil over the next few days.   It is considered to be one of the most devastating human-caused environmental disasters.   The Valdez spill is the second largest in US waters, after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, in terms of volume released.   Prince William Sound's remote location, accessible only by helicopter, plane, or boat, made government and industry response efforts difficult and severely taxed existing response plans. 

Édouard de Pomiane<====>10244<====>Édouard de PomianeÉdouard Alexandre de Pomiane, sometimes Édouard Pozerski (20 April 1875 in Paris – 26 January 1964 in Paris) was a French scientist, radio broadcaster and food writer.   His parents emigrated from Poland in 1863, changed their name from Pozerski to de Pomiane, and became French citizens. De Pomiane worked as a physician at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, where he gave Félix d'Herelle a place to work on bacteriophages. His best known works that have been translated into English are Cooking in Ten Minutes and Cooking with Pomiane.  His writing was remarkable in its time for its directness (he frequently uses a strange second-person voice, telling you—the reader—what you are seeing and smelling as you follow a recipe) and for his general disdain for upper-class elaborate French cuisine. 

Edward VI of England<====>10245<====>Edward VI of EnglandEdward VI (12 October 1537 – 6 July 1553) was King of England and Ireland from 28 January 1547 until his death.  He was crowned on 20 February at the age of nine.   The son of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour, Edward was England's first monarch to be raised as a Protestant.  During his reign, the realm was governed by a Regency Council because he never reached his majority.  The Council was first led by his uncle Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (1547–1549), and then by John Dudley, 1st Earl of Warwick, from 1551 Duke of Northumberland. 

Epinephrine<====>10250<====>EpinephrineEpinephrine, also known as adrenalin or adrenaline, is a hormone, neurotransmitter, and medication. Epinephrine is normally produced by both the adrenal glands and certain neurons.   It plays an important role in the fight-or-flight response by increasing blood flow to muscles, output of the heart, pupil dilation, and blood sugar.    It does this by binding to alpha and beta receptors.It is found in many animals and some single cell organisms.    Napoleon Cybulski first isolated epinephrine in 1895.   As a medication, it is used to treat a number of conditions including anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, and superficial bleeding. 

Electronic delay storage automatic calculator<====>10251<====>Electronic delay storage automatic calculator The electronic delay storage automatic calculator (EDSAC) was an early British computer.   Inspired by John von Neumann's seminal First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC, the machine was constructed by Maurice Wilkes and his team at the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in England.   EDSAC was the second electronic digital stored-program computer to go into regular service.  Later the project was supported by J.  Lyons & Co.  Ltd. , a British firm, who were rewarded with the first commercially applied computer, LEO I, based on the EDSAC design. 

E. H. Shepard<====>10252<====>E.  H.  Shepard  Ernest Howard Shepard  OBE, MC  (10 December 1879 – 24 March 1976) was an English artist and book illustrator.  He is known especially for illustrations of the anthropomorphic soft toy and animal characters in The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame and Winnie-the-Pooh by A.  A.  Milne. CareerShepard was born in St John's Wood, London.  Having shown some promise in drawing at St Paul's School, in 1897 he enrolled in the Heatherley School of Fine Art in Chelsea.   After a productive year there, he attended the Royal Academy Schools, winning a Landseer scholarship in 1899 and a British Institute prize in 1900. 

Enterobacteriaceae<====>10253<====>Enterobacteriaceae    The Enterobacteriaceae are a large family of Gram-negative bacteria that includes, along with many harmless symbionts, many of the more familiar pathogens, such as Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Yersinia pestis, Klebsiella, and Shigella.  Other disease-causing bacteria in this family include Proteus, Enterobacter, Serratia, and Citrobacter.  This family is the only representative in the order Enterobacteriales of the class Gammaproteobacteria in the phylum Proteobacteria.Phylogenetically, in the Enterobacteriales, several peptidoglycan-less insect endosymbionts  form a sister clade to the Enterobacteriaceae, but as they are not validly described, this group is not officially a taxon; examples of these species are Sodalis, Buchnera, Wigglesworthia, Baumannia cicadellinicola, and Blochmannia,  but not former Rickettsias. 

Essendon Football Club<====>10257<====>Essendon Football Club  The Essendon Football Club is a professional Australian rules football club which plays in the Australian Football League (AFL), the sport's premier competition.  Formed in 1871 as a junior club and playing as a senior club since 1878, Essendon is one of the oldest clubs in the AFL.  It is historically associated with Essendon, a suburb in the north-west of Melbourne, Victoria.  Since 2013, the club has been headquartered at the True Value Solar Centre, Melbourne Airport, and plays its home games at either Docklands Stadium or the Melbourne Cricket Ground; throughout most of its history the club's home ground and headquarters was Windy Hill, Essendon. 

Enid Blyton<====>10258<====>Enid Blyton    Enid Mary Blyton (11 August 1897 – 28 November 1968) was an English children's writer whose books have been among the world's best-sellers since the 1930s, selling more than 600 million copies.  Blyton's books are still enormously popular, and have been translated into 90 languages; her first book, Child Whispers, a 24-page collection of poems, was published in 1922.  She wrote on a wide range of topics including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery, and biblical narratives and is best remembered today for her Noddy, Famous Five, and Secret Seven series. Following the commercial success of her early novels such as Adventures of the Wishing-Chair (1937) and The Enchanted Wood (1939), Blyton went on to build a literary empire, sometimes producing fifty books a year in addition to her prolific magazine and newspaper contributions. 

Epipaleolithic<====>10259<====>Epipaleolithic  In archaeology, the Epipaleolithic is the final period of the Upper Palaeolithic, occurring at the end of the last glacial period, and leading without interruption into the Mesolithic.  The period is generally dated from   BP to   BP, having emerged from the Palaeolithic era.  The Natufian culture in the Levant is considered to be a late epipaleolithic culture. Term usageThe term is sometimes used synonymous with Mesolithic.  When a distinction is made, Epipaleolithic stresses the continuity with the Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic as it is understood today, whilst Protoneolithic stresses a subsequent transition to the Neolithic. 

Executive (government)<====>10263<====>Executive (government)  The executive is the organ exercising authority in and holding responsibility for the governance of a state.  The executive executes and enforces law. In political systems based on the principle of separation of powers, authority is distributed among several branches (executive, legislative, judicial) — an attempt to prevent the concentration of power in the hands of a small group of people.  In such a system, the executive does not pass laws (the role of the legislature) or interpret them (the role of the judiciary).  Instead, the executive enforces the law as written by the legislature and interpreted by the judiciary. 

Enrico Fermi<====>10264<====>Enrico Fermi    Enrico Fermi ( ;   ; 29 September 1901 – 28 November 1954) was an Italian-American physicist and the creator of the world's first nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1.  He has been called the "architect of the nuclear age"  and the "architect of the atomic bomb".   He was one of the very few physicists in history to excel both theoretically and experimentally.  Fermi held several patents related to the use of nuclear power, and was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity by neutron bombardment and the discovery of transuranic elements. 

Editor war<====>10268<====>Editor war Editor war is the common name for the rivalry between users of the Emacs and vi (usually Vim) text editors.  The rivalry has become a lasting part of hacker culture and the free software community. The Emacs vs vi debate was one of the original "holy wars" conducted on Usenet groups,  with many flame wars fought between those insisting that their editor of choice is the paragon of editing perfection, and insulting the other, since at least 1985.  EMACS vs.  vi: The endless geek 'holy war'  Related battles have been fought over operating systems, programming languages, version control systems, and even source code indent style. 

Eastern Orthodox Church organization<====>10270<====>Eastern Orthodox Church organization  This article covers the organization of the Eastern Orthodox Churches rather than the doctrines, traditions, practices, or other aspects of Eastern Orthodoxy.  Like the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church claims to be the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. The term Western Orthodoxy is sometimes used to denominate what is technically a vicariate within the Antiochian Orthodox and the Russian Orthodox Churches and thus a part of the Eastern Orthodox Church as that term is defined here.  The term "Western Orthodox Church" is disfavored by members of that vicariate. In the 5th century, Oriental Orthodoxy separated from Chalcedonian Christianity (and is therefore separate from both the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Church), well before the 11th century Great Schism. 

Electric guitar<====>10272<====>Electric guitarAn electric guitar is a guitar that uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical signals.  The vibration occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks, fingerpicks, or taps the strings.  The pickup used to sense the vibration generally uses electromagnetic induction to do so, though other technologies exist.  In any case, the signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is sent to a guitar amplifier before being sent to the speaker, which converts it into audible sound.  Since the output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, it can be electronically altered by to change the timbre of the sound. 

Embryo drawing<====>10273<====>Embryo drawing Embryo drawing is the illustration of embryos in their developmental sequence.  In plants and animals, an embryo develops from a zygote, the single cell that results when an egg and sperm fuse during fertilization.   In animals, the zygote divides repeatedly to form a ball of cells, which then forms a set of tissue layers that migrate and fold to form an early embryo.  Images of embryos provide a means of comparing embryos of different ages, and species.  To this day, embryo drawings are made in undergraduate developmental biology lessons. Comparing different embryonic stages of different animals is a tool that can be used to infer relationships between species, and thus biological evolution. 

Enthalpy<====>10274<====>Enthalpy  Enthalpy   is a measurement of energy in a thermodynamic system.   It is equal to the internal energy of the system plus the product of pressure and volume.  More technically, it includes the internal energy, which is the energy required to create a system, and the amount of energy required to make room for it by displacing its environment and establishing its volume and pressure.  Enthalpy is defined as a state function that depends only on the prevailing equilibrium state identified by the system's internal energy, pressure, and volume.  It is an extensive quantity.

Ennio Morricone<====>10277<====>Ennio Morricone  Ennio Morricone,  Grand Officer OMRI  ( ; born 10 November 1928) is an Italian composer, orchestrator, conductor, and former trumpet player. He composes a wide range of music styles, making him one of the most versatile, experimental and influential composers of all time, working in any medium.  Since 1946 Morricone has composed over 500 scores for cinema and television, as well as over 100 classical works. His filmography includes over 70 award-winning films, including all Sergio Leone films since A Fistful of Dollars (including For a Few Dollars More, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Once Upon a Time in the West and Once Upon a Time in America), all Giuseppe Tornatore films (since Cinema Paradiso), The Battle of Algiers, the Animal Trilogy, 1900, Exorcist II, Days of Heaven, several major films in French cinema, in particular the comedy trilogy La Cage aux Folles I, II, III and Le Professionnel, The Thing, The Mission, The Untouchables, Mission to Mars, Bugsy, Disclosure, In the Line of Fire, Bulworth, Ripley's Game and The Hateful Eight. After playing the trumpet in jazz bands in the 1940s, he became a studio arranger for RCA Victor and in 1955 started ghost writing for film and theatre. Throughout his career, he has composed music for artists such as Paul Anka, Mina, Milva, Zucchero and Andrea Bocelli. From 1960 to 1975, Morricone gained international fame for composing music for westerns. His score to 1966's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is considered one of the most influential soundtracks in history    and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.  With an estimated 10 million copies sold, Once Upon a Time in the West is one of the best-selling scores worldwide.  He also scored seven westerns for Sergio Corbucci, Duccio Tessari's Ringo duology and Sergio Sollima's The Big Gundown and Face to Face. Morricone worked extensively for other film genres with directors such as Bernardo Bertolucci, Mauro Bolognini, Giuliano Montaldo, Roland Joffé, Roman Polanski and Henri Verneuil.  His acclaimed soundtrack for The Mission (1986)  was certified gold in the United States. The album Yo-Yo Ma Plays Ennio Morricone stayed 105 weeks on the Billboard Top Classical Albums.   Morricone's best-known compositions include "The Ecstasy of Gold", "Se Telefonando", "Man with a Harmonica", "Here's to You", the UK No. 2 single "Chi Mai", "Gabriel's Oboe" and "E Più Ti Penso". He functioned during the period 1966–1980 as a main member of Il Gruppo, one of the first experimental composers collectives. In 1969, he co-founded Forum Music Village, a prestigious recording studio. From the 1970s, Morricone excelled in Hollywood, composing for prolific American directors such as Don Siegel, Mike Nichols, Brian De Palma, Barry Levinson, Oliver Stone, Warren Beatty and Quentin Tarantino. In 1977, he composed the official theme for the 1978 FIFA World Cup. He continued to compose music for European productions, such as Marco Polo, La Piovra, Nostromo, Fateless, Karol and En mai, fais ce qu'il te plait. Morricone's music has been reused in television series, including The Simpsons and The Sopranos, and in many films, including Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained.As of 2013, Ennio Morricone has sold over 70 million records worldwide. In 1971, he received a "Targa d'Oro" for the worldwide sales of 22 million.    In 2007, he received the Academy Honorary Award "for his magnificent and multifaceted contributions to the art of film music." He has been nominated for a further six Oscars. In 2016, Morricone received his first Academy Award for his score to Quentin Tarantino's film The Hateful Eight (2015), becoming the oldest person ever to win an Oscar. His other achievements include three Grammy Awards, three Golden Globes, six BAFTAs, ten David di Donatello, eleven Nastro d'Argento, two European Film Awards, the Golden Lion Honorary Award and the Polar Music Prize in 2010.Life and careerMorricone was born in Rome, the son of Libera Ridolfi and Mario Morricone, a musician.  His family came from Arpino, near Frosinone. Morricone, who had four siblings, Adriana, Aldo, Maria and Franca, lived in Trastevere, in the centre of Rome, with his parents. Mario was a trumpet player who worked professionally in different light-music orchestras, while Libera set up a small textile business. Classical educationHis first teacher was his father Mario Morricone, who taught him how to read music and also to play several instruments. Compelled to take up the trumpet, he entered the National Academy of St Cecilia, to take trumpet lessons under the guidance of Umberto Semproni. Morricone formally entered the conservatory in 1940 at age 12, enrolling in a four-year harmony program. He completed it within six months. He studied the trumpet, composition, and choral music, under direction of Goffredo Petrassi, who influenced him; Morricone has since dedicated his concert pieces to Petrassi. In 1941, Morricone was chosen among the students of the National Academy of St Cecilia to be a part of the Orchestra of the Opera directed by Carlo Zecchi on the occasion of a tour of "Veneto" (the region of Venice).  In 1946, he received his Diploma in Trumpet.  After he graduated, he continued to work in classical composition and arrangement.Although the composer had received the Diploma in Instrumentation for Band Arrangement (fanfare) with a mark of 9/10 in 1952, his studies concluded at the Conservatory of Santa Cecilia in 1954 and obtained a final 9.5/10 in his Diploma in Composition, under the composer Goffredo Petrassi.   First compositionsMorricone wrote his first compositions when he was six years old and was encouraged to develop his natural talents.  In 1946, he composed "Il Mattino" ("The Morning") for voice and piano on a text by Fukuko, first in a group of seven "youth" Lieder.In the following years, he continued to write music for the theatre as well as classical music for voice and piano, such as "Imitazione", based on a text by Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi, "Intimità", based on a text by Olinto Dini, "Distacco I" and "Distacco II" with words by R. Gnoli, "Oboe Sommerso" for baritone and five instruments with words by poet Salvatore Quasimodo and "Verrà la Morte", for contralto and piano, based on a text by novelist Cesare Pavese. In 1953, Morricone was asked by Gorni Kramer and Lelio Luttazzi to write an arrangement for some medleys in an American style for a series of evening radio shows. The composer continued with the composition of other 'serious' classical pieces, thus demonstrating the flexibility and eclecticism which has always been an integral part of his character. Many orchestral and chamber compositions date, in fact, from the period between 1954 and 1959: Musica per archi e pianoforte (1954), Invenzione, Canone e Ricercare per piano; Sestetto per flauto, oboe, fagotto, violino, viola e violoncello (1955), Dodici Variazione per oboe, violoncello e piano; Trio per clarinetto, corno e violoncello; Variazione su un tema di Frescobaldi (1956); Quattro pezzi per chitarra (1957); Distanze per violino, violoncello e piano; Musica per undici violini, Tre Studi per flauto, clarinetto e fagotto (1958); and the Concerto per orchestra (1957), dedicated to his teacher Goffredo Petrassi. Morricone soon gained popularity by writing his first background music for radio dramas and quickly moved into film. Composing for radio, television and pop artistsMorricone's career as an arranger started in 1950, by arranging the piece Mamma Bianca (Narciso Parigi).  In occasion of the "Anno Santo" (Holy Year), he arranged a long group of popular songs of devotion for radio broadcasting. In 1956, Morricone started to support his family by playing in a jazz band and arranging pop songs for the Italian broadcasting service RAI. He was hired by RAI in 1958, but quit his job on his first day at work when he was told that broadcasting of music composed by employees was forbidden by a company rule. Subsequently, Morricone became a top studio arranger at RCA Victor, working with Renato Rascel, Rita Pavone, and Mario Lanza.Throughout his career Morricone has composed songs for several national and international jazz and pop artists. In 1962 Morricone worked with American jazz singer Helen Merrill as an arranger on an EP "Helen Merrill sings Italian Songs" on the RCA Italiana label.  Gianni Morandi (Go Kart Twist, 1962), Alberto Lionello (La donna che vale, 1959), Edoardo Vianello (Ornella, 1960; Cicciona cha-cha, 1960; Faccio finta di dormire, 1961; T'ho conosciuta, 1963; ), Nora Orlandi (Arianna, 1960), Jimmy Fontana (Twist no. 9; Nicole, 1962), Rita Pavone (Come te non-ce nessuno and Pel di carota from 1962, arranged by Luis Bacalov), Catherine Spaak (Penso a te; Questi vent'anni miei, 1964), Luigi Tenco (Quello che conta; Tra tanta gente; 1962), Gino Paoli (Nel corso from 1963, written by Morricone with Paoli), Renato Rascel (Scirocco, 1964), Paul Anka (Ogni Volta), Amii Stewart, Rosy Armen (L'Amore Gira), Milva (Ridevi, Metti Una Sera A Cena), Françoise Hardy (Je changerais d'avis, 1966), Mireille Mathieu (Mon ami de toujours; Pas vu, pas pris, 1971; J'oublie la pluie et le soleil, 1974) and Demis Roussos (I Like The World, 1970).  In 1963, the composer co-wrote (with Roby Ferrante) the music for the composition "Ogni volta" ("Every Time"), a song that was performed by Paul Anka for the first time during the Festival di San Remo in 1964. This song was arranged and conducted by Morricone and sold over three million copies worldwide, including one million copies in Italy alone.  Another particular success was his composition, "Se telefonando."  Performed by Mina, it was a standout track of Studio Uno 66, the fifth-biggest-selling album of the year 1966 in Italy.  Morricone's sophisticated arrangement of "Se telefonando" was a combination of melodic trumpet lines, Hal Blaine–style drumming, a string set, a '60s Europop female choir, and intensive subsonic-sounding trombones. The Italian Hitparade No. 7 song had eight transitions of tonality building tension throughout the chorus. During the following decades, the song was covered by several performers in Italy and abroad most notably by Françoise Hardy and Iva Zanicchi (1966), Delta V (2005), Vanessa and the O's (2007), and Neil Hannon (2008).  Françoise Hardy – Mon amie la rose site in the reader's poll conducted by the la Repubblica newspaper to celebrate Mina's 70th anniversary in 2010, 30,000 voters picked the track as the best song ever recorded by Mina. In 1987, Morricone co-wrote 'It Couldn't Happen Here' with the Pet Shop Boys. Other notable compositions for international artists include: La metà di me and Immagina (1988) by Ruggero Raimondi, Libera l'amore (1989) performed by Zucchero, Love Affair (1994) by k.d. lang, Ha fatto un sogno (1997) by Antonello Venditti, Di Più (1997) by Tiziana Tosca Donati, Come un fiume tu (1998), Un Canto (1998) and Conradian (2006) by Andrea Bocelli, Ricordare (1998) and Salmo (2000) by Angelo Branduardi and My heart and I (2001) by Sting. First film scoresAfter graduating in 1954, Morricone started writing and arranging music as a ghost writer for films credited to other already well-known composers, while also arranging for many light music orchestras of the RAI television network, working most notably with Armando Trovajoli, Alessandro Cicognini and Carlo Savina. He occasionally adopted Anglicized pseudonyms, such as Dan Savio and Leo Nichols.In 1959, Morricone was the conductor (and uncredited co-composer) for Mario Nascimbene's score to Morte Di Un Amico (Death of a Friend), an Italian drama directed by Franco Rossi. In the same year, he composed music for the theatre show Il Lieto Fine by Luciano Salce.The 1960s began on a positive note: 1961 marked in fact his real film debut with Luciano Salce's Il Federale (The Fascist). In an interview with American composer Fred Karlin, Morricone discussed his beginnings, stating, My first films were light comedies or costume movies that required simple musical scores that were easily created, a genre that I never completely abandoned even when I went on to much more important films with major directors.   Il Federale marked the beginning of a long-run collaboration with Luciano Salce. In 1962 Morricone composed the jazz-influenced score for Salce's comedy La voglia matta (Crazy Desire). That year Morricone arranged also Italian singer Edoardo Vianello's summer hit "Pinne, Fucile e Occhiali", a cha-cha song, peppered with added water effects, unusual instrumental sounds and unexpected stops and starts. Morricone wrote more works in the climate of the Italian avant-garde. A few of these compositions have been made available on CD, such as "Ut", his trumpet concerto dedicated to the soloist Mauro Maur, one of his favorite musicians; some have yet to be premiered.The Group and New ConsonanceFrom 1964 up to their eventual disbandment in 1980, he was part of Gruppo di Improvvisazione di Nuova Consonanza (G.I.N.C.), a group of composers who performed and recorded avant garde free improvisations. The Rome-based avant-garde ensemble was dedicated to the development of improvisation and new music methods. The ensemble functioned as a laboratory of sorts, working with anti-musical systems and sound techniques in an attempt to redefine the new music ensemble and explore "New Consonance." Known as "The Group" or "Il Gruppo," they released seven albums across the Deutsche Grammophon, RCA and Cramps labels: Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza (1966), The Private Sea of Dreams (1967), Improvisationen (1968), The Feed-back (1970), Improvvisazioni a Formazioni Variate (1973), Nuova Consonanza (1975) and Musica su Schemi (1976). Perhaps the most famous of these is their album entitled The Feed-back, which combines free jazz and avant-garde classical music with funk; the album is frequently sampled by hip-hop DJs and is considered to be one of the most collectable records in existence, often fetching over $1,000 at auction. Morricone played a key role in The Group and was among the core members in its revolving line-up; in addition to serving as their trumpet player, he directed them on many occasions and they can be heard on a large number of his scores from the 1970s.Held in high regard in avant-garde music circles, they are considered to be the first experimental composers collective, their only peers being the British improvisation collective AMM. Their influence can be heard in free improvising ensembles from the European movements including Evan Parker Electro-Acoustic Ensemble, the Swiss electronic free improvisation group Voice Crack, John Zorn  and in the techniques of modern classical music and avant-garde jazz groups. The ensemble's groundbreaking work informed their work in composition. The ensemble also performed in varying capacities with Morricone, contributing to some of his '60s and '70s Italian soundtracks, including A Quiet Place in the Country (1969) and Cold Eyes of Fear (1971). Film music genresComedyHis earliest scores were Italian light comedy and costume pictures, where Morricone learned to write simple, memorable themes. During the sixties and seventies he composed the scores for comedies such as Diciottenni al sole (1962), Il Successo (1963), Lina Wertmüller's I basilischi (1963),  Slalom (1965), Menage all'italiana (1965), How I Learned to Love Women (1966), L'harem (1967), A Fine Pair (1968), L'Alibi (1969), Questa specie d'amore (1972), Forza "G" (1972) and Fiorina la vacca (1972).His best-known scores for comedies includes La Cage aux Folles (1978) and La Cage aux Folles II (1980), both directed by Édouard Molinaro, Il ladrone (1980), Georges Lautner's La Cage aux Folles 3: The Wedding (1985), Pedro Almodóvar's Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990) and Warren Beatty's Bulworth (1998). Morricone has never ceased to arrange and write music for comedies. In 2007, he composed a lighthearted score for the Italian romantic comedy Tutte le Donne della mia Vita by Simona Izzo, the director who co-wrote the Morricone-scored religious mini-series Il Papa Buono. WesternsThough his first films were undistinguished, Morricone's arrangement of an American folk song intrigued director and former schoolmate Sergio Leone. Before being associated with Leone, Morricone had already composed some music for less-known western movies such as Duello nel Texas (aka Gunfight at Red Sands) (1963). In 1962, Morricone met American folksinger Peter Tevis, who is credited with singing the lyrics of Morricone's songs such as "A Gringo Like Me" (from Gunfight at Red Sands) and "Lonesome Billy" (from Bullets Don't Argue). Association with Sergio LeoneThe turning point in Morricone's career took place in 1964, the year in which his third child, Andrea Morricone, who would also become a film composer, was born. Film director Sergio Leone hired Morricone, and together they created a distinctive score to accompany Leone's different version of the Western, A Fistful of Dollars (1964).The Dollars trilogy Because budget strictures limited Morricone's access to a full orchestra, he used gunshots, cracking whips, whistle, voices, jew's harp, trumpets, and the new Fender electric guitar, instead of orchestral arrangements of Western standards à la John Ford. Morricone used his special effects to punctuate and comically tweak the action—cluing in the audience to the taciturn man's ironic stance. Though sonically bizarre for a movie score, Morricone's music was   true to Leone's vision. As memorable as Leone's close-ups, harsh violence, and black comedy, Morricone's work helped to expand the musical possibilities of film scoring. Morricone was initially billed on the film as Dan Savio. A Fistful of Dollars came out in Italy in 1964 and was released in America three years later, greatly popularizing the so-called Spaghetti Western genre. For the American release, Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone decided to adopt American-sounding names, so they called themselves respectively Bob Robertson and Dan Savio. Over the film's theatrical release, it grossed more than any other Italian film up to that point. Hughes, p. 7.  The film debuted in the United States in January 1967, where it grossed   for the year.  It eventually grossed $14.5 million in its American release,  against its budget of  200–250,000. Hughes, p. 4.  Munn, p. 48. With the score of A Fistful of Dollars, Morricone began his 20-year collaboration with his childhood friend Alessandro Alessandroni and his Cantori Moderni.  Alessandroni provided the whistling and the twanging guitar on the film scores, while his Cantori Moderni were a flexible troupe of modern singers. Morricone specifically exploited the solo soprano of the group, Edda Dell'Orso, at the height of her powers "an extraordinary voice at my disposal".The composer subsequently scored Leone's other two Dollars Trilogy (or Man With No Name Trilogy) spaghetti westerns: For a Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). All three films starred the American actor Clint Eastwood as The Man With No Name and depicted Leone's own intense vision of the mythical West. Some of the music was written before the film, which was unusual. Leone's films were made like that because he wanted the music to be an important part of it; he kept the scenes longer because he did not want the music to end. According to Morricone this explains why the films are so slow.Despite the small film budgets, the Dollars Trilogy was a box-office success. The available budget for The Good, the Bad and The Ugly was about  1.2 million, but it became the most successful film of the Dollars Trilogy, grossing  25.1 million in the United States and over 2,3 billion lire (1,2 million EUR) in Italy alone. Morricone's score became a major success and sold over three million copies worldwide. On 14 August 1968 the original score was certified by the RIAA with a golden record for the sale of 500,000 copies in the United States only. The main theme of For a Few Dollars More ("Per Qualche Dollaro in Più") was covered by Hugo Montenegro ("For a Few Dollars More"),  Babe Ruth ("Theme From a Few Dollars More"),  Golden Palominos ("For A Few Dollars More"),  Material ("For a Few Dollars More"),  and Matti Heinivaho ("Arosusi").  More recently, a Techno-Industrial cover was done by Komor Kommando ("Hasta Luego"). A remix was done by Terranova, "For a Few Dollars More (Terranova Remix)". Hugo Montenegro's version of the main theme of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly sold over one million copies worldwide. Montenegro's album with the same name included a selection of Morricone's compositions from the Dollars Trilogy.  In the United States, the album was certified gold by the RIAA on 9 September 1969.  The main theme was later sampled by artists such as Cameo ("Word Up!"), Bomb the Bass and LL Cool J. "The Ecstasy of Gold" became one of Morricone's best-known compositions. The opening scene of Jeff Tremaine's Jackass Number Two (2006), in which the cast is chased through a suburban neighborhood by bulls, is accompanied by this piece. While punk rock band the Ramones used "The Ecstasy of Gold" as closing theme during their live performances, Metallica uses "The Ecstasy of Gold" as the introductory music for its concerts since 1983   This composition is also included on Metallica's live symphonic album S&M as well as the live album Live Shit: Binge & Purge. An instrumental metal cover by Metallica (with minimal vocals by lead singer James Hetfield) appeared on the 2007 Morricone tribute album We All Love Ennio Morricone. This metal version was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In 2009, the Grammy Award-winning hip-hop artist Coolio extensively sampled the theme for his song "Change". Once Upon a Time in the West and others Subsequent to the success of the Dollars trilogy, Morricone composed also the scores for Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) and Leone's last credited western film A Fistful of Dynamite (1971), as well as the scores for My Name Is Nobody (1973) and A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe (1975), produced by Sergio Leone.Morricone's score for Once Upon a Time in the West is one of the best-selling original instrumental scores in the world today, with up to 10 million copies sold, including one million copies   in France and over 800,000 copies  in the Netherlands.   One of the main themes from the score, "A Man with Harmonica" (L'uomo Dell'armonica), became worldwide known and sold over 1,260,000 copies in France alone.  This theme was later sampled in popular songs such as Beats International's "Dub Be Good to Me"  (1990) and The Orb's ambient single "Little Fluffy Clouds" (1990).    Film composer Hans Zimmer sampled "A Man with Harmonica" in 2007 as part of his composition "Parlay" (from the soundtrack Pirates of the Caribbean – at World's End).   The collaboration with Leone is considered one of the exemplary collaborations between a director and a composer. Morricone's last score for Leone was for his last film, the gangster drama Once Upon a Time in America (1984). Leone died on 30 April 1989 of a heart attack at the age of 60. Before his death in 1989, Leone was part-way through planning a film on the Siege of Leningrad, set during World War II. By 1989, Leone had been able to acquire  100 million in financing from independent backers for the war epic. He had convinced Morricone to compose the film score. The project was canceled when Leone died two days before he was to officially sign on for the film. In early 2003, Italian filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore announced he would direct a film called Leningrad.  The film has yet to go into production and Morricone has been cagey thus far as to details on account of Tornatore's superstitious nature. Association with Sergio Corbucci and Sergio SollimaTwo years after the start of his collaboration with Sergio Leone, Morricone also started to score music for another Spaghetti Western director, Sergio Corbucci. The composer wrote music for Corbucci's Navajo Joe (1966), The Hellbenders (1967), The Mercenary/The Professional Gun (1968), The Great Silence (1968), Compañeros (1970), Sonny and Jed (1972) and What Am I Doing in the Middle of the Revolution? (1972).In addition, Morricone composed music for the western films by Sergio Sollima, The Big Gundown (with Lee Van Cleef, 1966), Face to Face (1967) and Run, Man, Run! (1968), as well as the 1970 crime thriller Violent City (with Charles Bronson) and the poliziottesco film Revolver (1973).Other westernsOther relevant scores for less popular Spaghetti Westerns include Duello nel Texas (1963),   (1964), A Pistol for Ringo (1965), The Return of Ringo (1965), Seven Guns for the MacGregors (1966), The Hills Run Red (1966), Giulio Petroni's Death Rides a Horse (1967) and Tepepa (1968), A Bullet for the General (1967), Guns for San Sebastian (with Charles Bronson and Anthony Quinn, 1968), A Sky Full of Stars for a Roof (1968), The Five Man Army (1969), Don Siegel's Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970), Life Is Tough, Eh Providence? (1972) and Buddy Goes West (1981).Dramas & political moviesWith Leone's films, Ennio Morricone's name had been put firmly on the map. Most of Morricone's film scores of the 1960s were composed outside the Spaghetti Western genre, while still using Alessandroni's team. Their music included the themes for Il Malamondo (1964), Slalom (1965) and Listen, Let's Make Love (1967). In 1968, Morricone reduced his work outside the movie business and wrote scores for 20 films in the same year. The scores included psychedelic accompaniment for Mario Bava's superhero romp Danger: Diabolik (1968).His talent and creativity were such that many other directors were soon keen to collaborate with him, and in the next few years Morricone scored a lot of films by politically committed directors: collaborating with Marco Bellocchio (Fists in the Pocket, 1965), Gillo Pontecorvo (The Battle of Algiers (1966) and Queimada! (1969) with Marlon Brando), Roberto Faenza (H2S, 1968), Giuliano Montaldo (Sacco e Vanzetti, 1971), Giuseppe Patroni Griffi ('Tis Pity She's a Whore, 1971), Mauro Bolognini (Drama of the Rich, 1974), Umberto Lenzi (Almost Human, 1974), Pier Paolo Pasolini (Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom, 1975), Bernardo Bertolucci (Novecento, 1976) and Tinto Brass (The Key, 1983).In 1970, Morricone wrote the score for Violent City. That same year, he received his first Nastro d'Argento for the music in Metti una sera a cena (Giuseppe Patroni Griffi, 1969) and his second only a year later for Sacco e Vanzetti (Giuliano Montaldo, 1971), in which he had made a memorable collaboration with the legendary American folk singer and activist Joan Baez. His soundtrack for Sacco e Vanzetti contains another well-known composition by Morricone, the folk song "Here's to You", sung by Joan Baez. For the writing of the lyrics, Baez was inspired by a letter from Bartolomeo Vanzetti: "Father, yes, I am a prisoner / Fear not to relay my crime". The song became a hit in several countries, selling over 790,000 copies in France only.  The song was later included in movies such as The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou  and in the video game Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots as the closing theme as well as Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes.In the same year, Morricone composed the score for the less-known drama Maddalena (1971) by the Polish film director Jerzy Kawalerowicz which included its composition 'Chi Mai'. The theme appeared on the million-selling score for Georges Lautner's Le Professionnel (1981),  as well as the TV series, An Englishman's Castle (1978) and The Life and Times of David Lloyd George (1981).  Because of its appearance on the latter, "Chi Mai" reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart in 1981.  The single was certified by the BPI with a golden record on 1 May 1981  and sold over 900,000 copies in France alone.  "Chi Mai" is also the name of the online community about Morricone, which offers a repository of information and a free online magazine called "Maestro", containing reviews, articles, discoveries and free comments. In the beginning of the 1970s, Morricone achieved success with other singles, including A Fistful of Dynamite (1971) and God With Us (1974), having sold respectively 477,000 and 378,000 copies in France only.  Between 1967 and 1993 the composer had a long-term collaboration with director Mauro Bolognini. Morricone wrote more than 15 film scores for Bolognini, including Le streghe (1966), L'assoluto naturale (1969), Un bellissimo novembre (1969), Metello (1970), Chronicle of a Homicide (1972), Libera, My Love (1973), Per le antiche scale (1975), La Dame aux camelias (1980), Mosca addio (1987), Gli indifferenti (1988) and Husband and Lovers (1992).Horror & gialloEnnio Morricone's eclecticism and knack for creating highly poignant, melodic and emotional music found great scope also in horror movies, such as the baroque thrillers of Dario Argento, from The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (1969), The Cat o' Nine Tails (1970) and Four Flies on Grey Velvet (1971) to The Stendhal Syndrome (1996) and The Phantom of the Opera (1998). His other horror scores include Nightmare Castle (1965), A Quiet Place in the Country (1968), The Antichrist (1974), Autopsy (1975) and Night Train Murders (1975).In addition, Morricone's music has also been featured in many popular and cult Italian giallo films, such as Senza sapere niente di lei (1969), Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion (1970), A Lizard in a Woman's Skin (1971), Cold Eyes of Fear (1971), The Fifth Cord (1971), Short Night of Glass Dolls (1971), My Dear Killer (1972), What Have You Done to Solange? (1972), Black Belly of the Tarantula (1972), Who Saw Her Die? (1972) and Spasmo (1974).In 1977 Morricone scored Alberto De Martino's apocalyptic horror film Holocaust 2000, starring Kirk Douglas. In 1982 he composed the score for John Carpenter's science fiction horror movie The Thing. From AFI (The American Film Institute), accessed September 2011.  Morricone's main theme for the film was reflected in Marco Beltrami's film's score of the prequel of the 1982 film, which was released in 2011.Hollywood careerThe Dollars Trilogy was not released in the United States until 1967 when United Artists, who had already enjoyed success distributing the British-produced James Bond films in the United States, decided to release Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns. The American release gave Morricone an exposure in America and his film music became quite popular in the United States. One of Morricone's first contributions to an American director concerned his music for the religious epic film The Bible: In the Beginning by John Huston. According to Sergio Miceli's book Morricone, la musica, il cinema, Morricone wrote about 15 or 16 minutes of music, which were recorded for a screen test and conducted by Franco Ferrara. At first Morricone's teacher Goffredo Petrassi had been engaged to write the score for the great big budget epic, but Huston preferred another composer. RCA Records then proposed Morricone who was under contract with them, but a conflict between the film's producer Dino De Laurentiis and RCA occurred. The producer wanted to have the exclusive rights for the soundtrack, while RCA still had the monopoly on Morricone at that time and did not want to release the composer. Subsequently, Morricone's work was rejected because he did not get the ok by RCA to work for Dino De Laurentiis alone. The composer reused the parts of his unused score for The Bible: In the Beginning in such films as The Return of Ringo (1965) by Duccio Tessari and Alberto Negrin's The Secret of the Sahara (1987).Morricone never left Rome to compose his music and never learned to speak English. But given that the composer has always worked in a wide field of composition genres, from absolute music, which he has always produced, to applied music, working as orchestrator as well as conductor in the recording field, and then as a composer for theatre, radio and cinema, the impression arises that he never really cared that much about his standing in the eyes of Hollywood. 1970–1985: from Two Mules to Red SonjaIn 1970, Morricone composed the music for Don Siegel's Two Mules for Sister Sara, an American-Mexican western film starring Shirley MacLaine and Clint Eastwood. The same year the composer also delivered the title theme The Men from Shiloh for the American Western television series The Virginian    and the score for Phil Karlson's war film Hornets' Nest, starring Rock Hudson, and scored Bluebeard, starring Richard Burton, two years later.In 1974 Morricone wrote music for some unknown episodes of the science-fiction television series Space: 1999,  directed by Lee H. Katzin, and the following year he scored the George Kennedy revenge thriller The 'Human' Factor, which was the final film of director Edward Dmytryk. Two years later he composed the score for the sequel to William Friedkin's 1973 film The Exorcist, directed by John Boorman: Exorcist II: The Heretic. The horror film was a major disappointment at the box office. The film grossed  30,749,142 in the United States,    turning a profit but still disappointing in comparison to the original film's gross. The same year he scored the Dino De Laurentiis produced adventure film Orca, starring Richard Harris, which was also only a minor hit but later developed a cult following.In 1978, the composer worked with Terrence Malick for Days of Heaven, starring Richard Gere. During the lengthy editing process of the romantic drama, which won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography with an additional three nominations for the score, Terrence Malick and Billy Weber made use of a temporary score dominated by Morricone's music for the Bernardo Bertolucci film Novecento. Malick also chose the ethereal Aquarium music from Camille Saint-Saëns ("The Carnival of the Animals") to frame the film. When Malick decided he wanted Morricone to score his movie, the director sent a version of it to Italy with the Novecento temp track in place. Morricone agreed to the assignment and Malick flew to Italy because the composer did not fly, so would not travel to the United States. Malick took the movie over to Morricone in Italy and Morricone was writing for Days of Heaven the whole time. Afterwards they scored the music in Italy. In Days of Heaven, Morricone's elegiac music coexists with pre-existing selections.Despite the fact that Morricone had produced some of the most popular and widely imitated film music ever written throughout the 1960s and '70s, Days of Heaven earned him his first Oscar nomination for Best Original Score, with his score up against Jerry Goldsmith's The Boys from Brazil, Dave Grusin's Heaven Can Wait, Giorgio Moroder's Midnight Express (the eventual winner) and John Williams's Superman: The Movie at the Oscar ceremonies in 1979.   In 1979, Morricone provided the music for the thriller Bloodline, directed by Terence Young, best known for directing the James Bond films Dr. No (1962), From Russia with Love (1963), and Thunderball (1965). Subsequently, the composer was asked to score Michael Ritchie's The Island (1980, starring Michael Caine), Gordon Willis's thriller Windows (1980), Andrew Bergman's comedy So Fine (1981) starring Ryan O'Neal, Matt Cimber's film Butterfly (1982), starring Pia Zadora, Samuel Fuller's controversial drama film White Dog (1982) and Thieves After Dark (1984), Jerry London's critically acclaimed TV movie The Scarlet and the Black (1983), starring Gregory Peck, and Richard Fleischers box office bomb Red Sonja (1985), starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Brigitte Nielsen.1986 onwards: from The Mission to The Hateful EightMorricone's most fruitful and often long-term collaborations have been with Hollywood-related directors such as Brian De Palma, Barry Levinson, Warren Beatty, Oliver Stone and especially Roland Joffé, for whom Morricone wrote one of his best-known scores, the highly evocative soundtrack for The Mission (1986).Association with Roland Joffé The Mission, directed by Joffé, was about a piece of history considerably more distant, as Spanish Jesuit missionaries see their work undone as a tribe of Paraguayan natives fall within a territorial dispute between the Spanish and Portuguese. Morricone's score is considered as an example of an absolute pinnacle of what music can do for a film, and what a soundtrack album can do to enrich the listener's life. At one point the score was one of the world's best-selling film scores, selling over 3 million copies worldwide.  Morricone finally received a second Oscar nomination for The Mission.  Morricone's original score lost out to Herbie Hancock's coolly arranged jazz on Bertrand Tavernier's Round Midnight. It was considered as a surprising win and a controversial one, given that much of the music in the film was pre-existing. "'The Mission' tops Variety composers' poll of the all-time greatest film scores", HitFix, Guy Lodge, 14 November 2012.  Morricone stated the following during a 2001 interview with The Guardian: "I definitely felt that I should have won for The Mission. Especially when you consider that the Oscar-winner that year was Round Midnight, which was not an original score. It had a very good arrangement by Herbie Hancock, but it used existing pieces. So there could be no comparison with The Mission. There was a theft!"    His score for The Mission was ranked at number 1 in a poll of the all-time greatest film scores. The top 10 list was compiled by 40 film composers such as Michael Giacchino and Carter Burwell.  The score is ranked 23rd on the AFI's list of 25 greatest film scores of all time. The composer wrote also the music for three other movies by Joffé: Fat Man and Little Boy (1989, starring Paul Newman), City of Joy (1992, starring Patrick Swayze) and the opening film for the 2000 Cannes Film Festival, Vatel, starring Gérard Depardieu, Uma Thurman and Tim Roth.Association with De Palma and LevinsonOn three occasions, Brian De Palma worked with Morricone: The Untouchables (1987), the 1989 war drama Casualties of War and the science fiction film Mission to Mars (2000).  De Palma's The Untouchables, starring rising star Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness, Robert De Niro as Al Capone and the Oscar-winning Sean Connery, was released in 1987. Morricone's score for The Untouchables resulted in his third nomination for Academy Award for Best Original Score.In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, Morricone stated that he had good experiences with De Palma: "De Palma is delicious! He respects music, he respects composers. For The Untouchables, everything I proposed to him was fine, but then he wanted a piece that I didn't like at all, and of course we didn't have an agreement on that. It was something I didn't want to write – a triumphal piece for the police. I think I wrote nine different pieces for this in total and I said, 'Please don't choose the seventh!' because it was the worst. And guess what he chose? The seventh one. But it really suits the movie." Another American director, Barry Levinson, commissioned the composer on two occasions. First, for the crime-drama Bugsy, starring Warren Beatty, which received ten Oscar nominations,  winning two for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration (Dennis Gassner, Nancy Haigh) and Best Costume Design.   The highest-grossing American movie for which the composer wrote a complete score was for Levinson's Disclosure in 1994, starring Michael Douglas and Demi Moore."He doesn't have a piano in his studio, I always thought that with composers, you sit at the piano, and you try to find the melody. There's no such thing with Morricone. He hears a melody, and he writes it down. He hears the orchestration completely done", said Barry Levinson in an interview. Other notable Hollywood scoresDuring his career in Hollywood, Morricone was approached for numerous other projects, including the Gregory Nava drama A Time of Destiny (1988), Frantic by Polish-French director Roman Polanski (1988, starring Harrison Ford), Franco Zeffirelli's 1990 drama film Hamlet (starring Mel Gibson and Glenn Close), the neo-noir    crime film State of Grace by Phil Joanou (1990, starring Sean Penn and Ed Harris), Rampage (1992) by William Friedkin, and the romantic drama Love Affair (1994) by Warren Beatty.None of the aforementioned films were box office successes, but fortunately Morricone was also commissioned for more successful motion pictures such as In the Line of Fire (1993) by Wolfgang Petersen, starring Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich, the horror film Wolf (1994, Mike Nichols), which featured Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer in the lead roles, and Bulworth by Warren Beatty.In 1997, Morricone composed the music for Lolita (by Adrian Lyne) and Oliver Stone's U Turn, starring Sean Penn and Jennifer Lopez. A year later, Ennio Morricone wrote a complete score for the 1998 drama What Dreams May Come, but Vincent Ward found the music too emotional and replaced Morricone with Michael Kamen. One of his last complete scores for an American-related project includes the 2002 thriller Ripley's Game, starring John Malkovich, by Liliana Cavani.Extensive reuse of his musicBesides the 500 original film scores that have been composed by Morricone for movies and television series in a career of over six decades, his music is in addition frequently reused in more than 150 other film projects. Morricone's compositions appeared in the German TV series Derrick (1989), the live-action comedy film Inspector Gadget, Ally McBeal (2001), The Simpsons (2002), The Sopranos (2001–2002) and more recently in Dancing with the Stars (2010).Quentin Tarantino borrowed Morricone's music for several of his films. The Main Title of Death Rides a Horse (1967) can be heard in Kill Bill: Volume 1, while Kill Bill: Volume 2 contains music originally from For a Few Dollars More, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, The Mercenary and Navajo Joe. The themes "Paranoia Prima" and "Unexpected Violence" ("Violenza inattesa"), originally from respectively The Cat o' Nine Tails and The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, were used in Death Proof (2007) by Tarantino.In 2010, Tarantino originally wanted Morricone to compose the film score for Inglourious Basterds.Morricone was unable to, because the film's sped-up production schedule conflicted with his scoring of Giuseppe Tornatore's Baarìa.  However, Tarantino did use eight tracks composed by Morricone in the film, with four of them included on the soundtrack. The tracks came originally from Morricone's scores for The Big Gundown (1966), Revolver (1973) and Allonsanfàn (1974).    In 2012, Morricone composed the song "Ancora Qui" with lyrics by Italian singer Elisa for Tarantino's Django Unchained, a track that appeared together with three existing music tracks composed by Morricone on the soundtrack. "Ancora Qui" was one of the contenders for an Academy Award nomination in the Best Original Song category, but eventually the song was not nominated.  On 4 January 2013 Morricone presented Tarantino with a Life Achievement Award at a special ceremony being cast as a continuation of the International Rome Film Festival.  In 2014, Morricone claimed that he would "never work" with Tarantino again,  but later agreed to write an original film score for Tarantino's The Hateful Eight, which won an Academy Award in 2016 in the Best Original Score category. His nomination for this film marks him as the second oldest nominee in Academy history, behind Gloria Stuart. Morricone's win marked his first competitive Oscar, and at the age of 87 he became the oldest person to win a competitive Oscar.In 2014, Morricone's song "Giù La Testa" was featured in Florian Habicht's feature film Pulp: a Film about Life, Death & Supermarkets, an unconventional rockumentary about British group Pulp which premiered at SXSW that year.Composer for Giuseppe TornatoreIn 1988 Morricone started an ongoing and very successful collaboration with Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore. His first score for Tornatore was for the drama film Cinema Paradiso. The international version of the film won the Special Jury Prize at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival    and the 1989 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. In 2002, the director's cut 173-minute version was released (known in the U.S. as Cinema Paradiso: The New Version). Morricone received a BAFTA award and a David di Donatello for his score.After the success of Cinema Paradiso, the composer wrote the music for all subsequent films by Tornatore: the drama film Everybody's Fine (Stanno Tutti Bene, 1990), A Pure Formality (1994) starring Gérard Depardieu and Roman Polanski, The Star Maker (1995), The Legend of 1900 (1998) starring Tim Roth, the 2000 romantic drama Malèna (which featured Monica Bellucci) and the psychological thriller mystery film La sconosciuta (2006).More recently, Morricone composed the scores for Baarìa - La porta del vento (2009), The Best Offer (2013) starring Geoffrey Rush, Jim Sturgess and Donald Sutherland and the romantic drama The Correspondence (2015) starring Jeremy Irons and Olga Kurylenko.The composer won several music awards for his scores to Tornatore's movies. So, Morricone received a fifth Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe nomination for Malèna. For Legend of 1900, he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score.Television series & recent worksMorricone has worked for television, from a single title piece to variety shows and documentaries to TV series, including Moses the Lawgiver (1974), The Life and Times of David Lloyd George (1981), Marco Polo (1982) (which won two Primetime Emmys), The Secret of the Sahara (1987), I Promessi Sposi and Nostromo (1996).He wrote the score for the Mafia television series La piovra seasons 2 to 10 from 1985 to 2001, including the themes "Droga e sangue" ("Drugs and Blood"), "La Morale", and "L'Immorale". Morricone worked as the conductor of seasons 3 to 5 of the series. He also worked as the music supervisor for the television project La bibbia ("The Bible").In the late 1990s, he collaborated with his son Andrea on the Ultimo crime dramas, resulting in Ultimo (1998), Ultimo 2 – La sfida (1999), Ultimo 3 – L'infiltrato (2004) and Ultimo 4 – L'occhio del falco (2013).In the 2000s, Morricone continued to compose music for successful television series such as Il Cuore nel Pozzo (2005), Karol: A Man Who Became Pope (2005), La provinciale (2006), Giovanni Falcone (2007), Pane e libertà (2009) and Come Un Delfino 1–2 (2011–2013).With an estimated 13 million viewers, Karol: A Man Who Became Pope became an incredible success. Morricone wrote additional music for the sequel, Karol: The Pope, The Man (2006), which portrayed Karol's life as Pope from his papal inauguration to his death. Both scores were originally released respectively in 2005 and 2006. One year later, a double disc album with both scores is released.In 2003, Morricone scored another epic, for Japanese television, called Musashi and was the Taiga drama about Miyamoto Musashi, Japan's legendary warrior. A part of his "applied music" is now applied to Italian television films.Morricone provided the string arrangements on Morrissey's "Dear God Please Help Me" from the album Ringleader of the Tormentors in 2006. Since 2004, Morricone wrote music for almost exclusively Italian television movies and mini-series, especially for directors such as Giuseppe Tornatore, Alberto Negrin, Giuliano Montaldo, and Franza Di Rosa.In 2008, the composer recorded music for a Lancia commercial, featuring Richard Gere and directed by Harald Zwart (known for directing The Pink Panther 2). Tarantino originally wanted Morricone to compose the soundtrack for his film, Inglourious Basterds. However, Morricone refused because of the sped-up production schedule of the film.   Tarantino did use several Morricone tracks from previous films in the soundtrack. Morricone instead wrote the music for Baaria - La porta del vento by Tornatore. It was the second time Morricone's turned down the director, he also turned down an offer to write some music for Pulp Fiction in 1994. In spring and summer 2010, Morricone worked with Hayley Westenra for a collaboration on her album Paradiso.  The album features new songs written by Morricone, as well as some of his best-known film compositions of the last 50 years.   Hayley recorded the album with Morricone's orchestra in Rome during the summer of 2010.   Since 1995, he composed the music for several advertising campaigns of Dolce & Gabbana. The commercials were directed by Giuseppe Tornatore. In 2013, Morricone collaborated with Italian singer-songwriter Laura Pausini on a new version of her hit single "La solitudine" for her 20 years anniversary greatest hits album 20 – The Greatest Hits.Morricone composed the music for The Best Offer (2013) by Giuseppe Tornatore. In 2014, Ennio Morricone became a Honorary chairman of the First International Open Competition in author's music video "Mediamusic." The final of the competition was scheduled on 1 March 2015 in Moscow.He wrote the score for Christian Carion's En mai, fais ce qu'il te plait (2015) and the most recent movie by Tornatore: The Correspondence (2016), featuring Jeremy Irons and Olga Kurylenko. In July 2015, Quentin Tarantino announced after the screening of footage of his movie The Hateful Eight at the San Diego Comic-Con International that Morricone would score the film, the first Western that Morricone has scored since 1981.  The score was critically acclaimed and won several awards including the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and the Academy Award for Best Original Score.Live performances Before receiving his diplomas in trumpet, composition and instrumentation from the conservatory, Morricone was already active as a trumpet player, often performing in an orchestra that specialized in music written for films. After completing his education at Saint Cecilia, the composer honed his orchestration skills as an arranger for Italian radio and television. In order to support himself, he moved to RCA in the early sixties and entered the front ranks of the Italian recording industry.  Since 1964, Morricone was also a founding member of the Rome-based avant-garde ensemble Gruppo di Improvvisazione di Nuova Consonanza. During the existence of the group (until 1978), Morricone performed several times with the group as trumpet player.To ready his music for live performance, he joined smaller pieces of music together into longer suites. Rather than single pieces, which would require the audience to applaud every few minutes, Morricone thought the best idea was to create a series of suites lasting from 15 to 20 minutes, which form a sort of symphony in various movements – alternating successful pieces with personal favorites. In concert, Morricone normally has 180 to 200 musicians and vocalists under his baton, performing multiple genre-crossing collections of music. Rock, symphonic and ethnic instruments share the stage. On 20 September 1984 Morricone conducted the Orchestre National des Pays de la Loire at Cinésymphonie '84 ("Première nuit de la musique de film/First night of film music") in the French concert hall Salle Pleyel in Paris. He performed some of his best-known compositions such as Metti una sera a cena, Novecento and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.  Michel Legrand and Georges Delerue performed on the same evening. On 15 October 1987 Morricone gave a concert in front of 12,000 people in the Sportpaleis in Antwerp, Belgium, with the Dutch Metropole Orchestra and the Italian operatic soprano Alide Maria Salvetta.   A live-album with a recording of this concert was released in the same year.  On 9 June 2000 Morricone went to the Flanders International Film Festival Ghent to conduct his music together with the National Orchestra of Belgium.   During the concert's first part, the screening of The Life and Death of King Richard III (1912) was accompanied with live music by Morricone. It was the very first time that the score was performed live in Europe. The second part of the evening consisted of an anthology of the composer's work. The event took place on the eve of Euro 2000, the European Football Championship in Belgium and the Netherlands. Morricone performed over 250 concerts as of 2001. "Ennio Morricone soon in Florence", theflorencenewspaper.com, 12 October 2012  Since 2001, the composer has been on a world tour, the latter part sponsored by Giorgio Armani, with the Orchestra Roma Sinfonietta, touring London (Barbican 2001; 75th birthday Concerto, Royal Albert Hall 2003), Paris, Verona, and Tokyo. Morricone performed his classic film scores at the Munich Philharmonie in 2005 and Hammersmith Apollo Theatre in London, UK, on 1 & 2 December 2006.He made his North American concert debut on 3 February 2007 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The previous evening, Morricone had already presented at the United Nations a concert comprising some of his film themes, as well as the cantata Voci dal silenzio to welcome the new Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon. A Los Angeles Times review bemoaned the poor acoustics and opined of Morricone: "His stick technique is adequate, but his charisma as a conductor is zero." Morricone, though, has said: "Conducting has never been important to me. If the audience comes for my gestures, they had better stay outside."On 12 December 2007 Morricone conducted the Orchestra Roma Sinfonietta at the Wiener Stadthalle in Vienna, presenting a selection of his own works.Together with the Roma Sinfonietta and the Belfast Philharmonic Choir, Morricone performed at the Opening Concerts of the Belfast Festival at Queen's, in the Waterfront Hall on 17 and 18 October 2008.Morricone and Orchestra Roma Sinfonietta also held a concert at the Belgrade Arena (Belgrade, Serbia) on 14 February 2009.On 10 April 2010 Morricone conducted a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London with the Orchestra Roma Sinfonietta and (as in all of his previous London concerts) the Crouch End Festival Chorus. On 11 September he conducted a concert in Verona.On 26 February 2012 Morricone made his Australian debut when he conducted the Western Australian Youth Orchestra together with a 100 voice chorus (made up primarily of WASO chorus members) at the Burswood Theatre (part of Crown Perth (formerly known as Burswood Entertainment Complex)) in Perth. On 2 March 2012 he conducted the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra at Elder Park, Adelaide as part of the Adelaide Festival of Arts.On 22 December 2012 Morricone conducted the 85-piece Belgian orchestra "Orkest der Lage Landen" and a 100-piece choir during a two-hour concert in the Sportpaleis in Antwerp. In November 2013 Morricone began a world tour to coincide with the 50th anniversary of his film music career and performed in locations such as the Crocus City Hall in Moscow, Santiago, Chile, Berlin, Germany (O2 World), Budapest, Hungary, and Vienna (Stadhalle). Back in June 2014, Morricone had to cancel a U.S tour in New York (Barclays Center) and Los Angeles (Nokia Theatre LA Live) due to a back procedure on 20 February. Morricone postponed the rest of his world tour.In November 2014 Morricone stated that he will resume his European tour starting from February 2015. Forum Music Village In the late 1960s, Morricone and three other Italian composers (Piero Piccioni, Armando Trovajoli and Luis Bacalov) founded Forum Music Village (Rome), previously called Ortophonic recording studio. The recording studio has some peculiarities, one of them is the ability to record a church organ directly to the studio. Morricone has been using the studio to create his scores for the past 40 years. The studio has hosted many directors who have worked alongside him, including Brian De Palma, Oliver Stone and Barry Levinson.The Academy Award-winning scores of Il Postino: The Postman by Luis Bacalov and Life Is Beautiful by Nicola Piovani were recorded in Studio A of Forum Music Village.Notable artists who have recorded at Forum Music Village are Quincy Jones, Jon and Vangelis, Placido Domingo, Andrea Bocelli, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Will.i.am, Yo-Yo Ma, Morrissey, Bruno Nicolai, Alessandro Alessandroni, Goblin, Pino Donaggio, Nicola Piovani, Danger Mouse, Daniele Luppi and Cher. Personal lifeOn 13 October 1956 he married Maria Travia, whom he had met in 1950. Travia has written lyrics to complement her husband's pieces. Her works include the Latin texts for The Mission. They have three sons and a daughter, in order of birth: Marco (1957), Alessandra (1961), the conductor and film composer Andrea (Andrew) (1964), and Giovanni Morricone (1966), a filmmaker, who lives in New York City. Morricone has lived in Italy his entire life and has never desired to live in Hollywood.  Morricone is also not fluent in English and will take interviews only in his native language.  Influence and trivia Ennio Morricone has influenced many artists from other styles and genres, including Danger Mouse,  Dire Straits,  Muse,  Metallica,  Radiohead  and Hans Zimmer. Morricone's influence extends into the realm of pop music. Hugo Montenegro had a hit with a version of the main theme from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly in both the United Kingdom and the United States. This was followed by his album of Morricone's music in 1968. Aside from his music having been sampled by everyone from rappers (Jay-Z)  to electronic outfits (the Orb),  Morricone wrote "Se Telefonando", which became Italy's fifth biggest-selling record of 1966 and has since been re-recorded by Françoise Hardy, among many others, and scored the strings for "Dear God, Please Help Me" on Morrissey's 2006 Ringleader of the Tormentors album.Morricone's film music was also recorded by many artists. John Zorn recorded an album of Morricone's music, The Big Gundown, with Keith Rosenberg in the mid-1980s. Lyricists and poets have helped convert some of his melodies into a songbook.Morricone collaborated with world music artists, like Portuguese fado singer Dulce Pontes (in 2003 with Focus, an album praised by Paulo Coelho and where his songbook can be sampled) and virtuoso cellist Yo-Yo Ma (in 2004), who both recorded albums of Morricone classics with the Roma Sinfonietta Orchestra and Morricone himself conducting. The album Yo-Yo Ma Plays Ennio Morricone sold over 130,000 copies in 2004. In 1990 the American singer Amii Stewart, best known for the 1979 disco hit "Knock on Wood", recorded a tribute album entitled Pearls – Amii Stewart Sings Ennio Morricone for the RCA label, including a selection of the composer's best-known songs. Since the mid-1980s Stewart resides in Italy, the Pearls album features Rome's Philharmonic Orchestra and was co-produced by Morricone himself. Metallica uses Morricone's The Ecstasy of Gold as an intro at their concerts (shock jocks Opie and Anthony also used the song at the start of their XM Satellite Radio and CBS Radio shows.) The San Francisco Symphony Orchestra also played it on Metallica's album S&M.  The theme from A Fistful of Dollars is also used as a concert intro by The Mars Volta. Gnarls Barkley's hit single Crazy (2006) was musically inspired by Morricone The Spaghetti Western Orchestra is Morricone's tribute band started in Australia. Anna Calvi has admitted Morricone's influence. Alex Turner has noted Morricone's influence on his writing, in particular on The Last Shadow Puppets album The Age of the Understatement. In 2007, the tribute album We All Love Ennio Morricone was released, featuring performances by various artists, including Sarah Brightman, Andrea Bocelli, Celine Dion, Bruce Springsteen and Metallica.Morricone inspired the namesake of Morricone Youth, a New York band dedicated to playing music from film and television, founded by musician and radio host Devon E. Levins. In addition to composers like Lalo Schifrin and Jerry Goldsmith, the band has performed music from a large spectrum of Morricone's film career, ranging from his work in the spaghetti westerns to The Exorcist II, as well as original Morricone-inspired pieces. On their 2008 album Red of Tooth and Claw the independent rock band Murder by Death composed and included a song as a theme/tribute to Morricone entitled "Theme (for Ennio Morricone)". Radiohead drew inspiration from the recording style of Morricone for their album OK Computer.  Muse cites Morricone as an influence for the songs "City of Delusion", "Hoodoo", and "Knights of Cydonia" on their album Black Holes and Revelations. The band has recently started playing the song "Man with a Harmonica" live played by Chris Wolstenholme, as an intro to "Knights of Cydonia".   "The Globalist" from their 2015 album Drones features a Morricone-influenced introduction.The score for The Thing 2011 prequel film composed by Marco Beltrami was inspired and uses several elements from Morricone's original soundtrack from the 1982 film of the same name. His composition "Alla luce del giorno" is being used for a 30-second YouTube advertisement for Grubhub in September-October 2017Lovers on the Sun, a song released in 2014 by French music producer David Guetta, is influenced by Morricone's western scores. Discography Worldwide salesEnnio Morricone has sold well over 70 million records worldwide during his career that spanned over seven decades,   including 6.5 million albums and singles in France,    over three million in the United States and more than two million albums in Korea.  In 1971, the composer received his first golden record (disco d'oro) for the sale of 1,000,000 records in Italy   and a "Targa d'Oro" for the worldwide sales of 22 million.

[1] The Academy of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences, accessed September 2011. In 1984, the U.S. distributor of Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America reportedly failed to file the proper paperwork so that Morricone's score, regarded as one of his best, would be eligible for consideration for an Academy Award.Two years later, Morricone received his second Oscar nomination for The Mission.  He also received Oscar nominations for his scores to The Untouchables (1987), Bugsy (1991), Malèna (2000), and The Hateful Eight (2016).  On 28 February 2016, Morricone won his first Academy Award for his score to The Hateful Eight.

Ennio Morricone received the honorary Academy Award on 25 February 2007, presented by Clint Eastwood, "for his magnificent and multifaceted contributions to the art of film music." With the statuette came a standing ovation.  In conjunction with the honor, Morricone released a tribute album, We All Love Ennio Morricone, that featured as its centerpiece Celine Dion's rendition of "I Knew I Loved You" (based on "Deborah's Theme" from Once Upon a Time in America), which she performed at the ceremony. Behind-the-scenes studio production and recording footage of "I Knew I Loved You" can be viewed in the debut episode of the QuincyJones.com Podcast.  The lyric, as with Morricone's Love Affair, had been written by Alan and Marilyn Bergman. Morricone's acceptance speech was in his native Italian tongue and was interpreted by Clint Eastwood, who stood to his left. Eastwood and Morricone had in fact met two days earlier for the first time in 40 years at a reception.AFIIn 2005 four film scores by Ennio Morricone were nominated by the American Film Institute for an honoured place in the AFI's Top 25 of Best American Film Scores of All Time.

Emin Boztepe<====>10281<====>Emin Boztepe  Emin Boztepe (born 17 July 1962) is an American martial artist of Turkish origin who held German nationality prior to naturalization.He first came to prominence for his fight in 1986 with noted Wing Chun practitioner William Cheung,    and he continued to gain attention in the 1990s with a public challenge of the Gracie family.    He was a notable member of Leung Ting's Wing Tsun organisation until 2002, when he formed his own organisation. Early lifeBoztepe was born in Eskişehir, Turkey, the second of six children.  At the age of four, his family, originally from Bağlıca, Emirdağ,  moved to Germany. 

Erlang (unit)<====>10283<====>Erlang (unit) The erlang (symbol E ) is a dimensionless unit that is used in telephony as a measure of offered load or carried load on service-providing elements such as telephone circuits or telephone switching equipment.  A single cord circuit has the capacity to be used for 60 minutes in one hour.  Full utilization of that capacity, 60 minutes of traffic, constitutes 1 erlang.  In 1946, the CCITT named the international unit of telephone traffic the erlang in honor of Agner Krarup Erlang.  Traffic measurements of a telephone circuitWhen used to represent carried traffic, a value (which can be a non-integer such as 43. 

Eligible receiver<====>10285<====>Eligible receiver In American football and Canadian football, not all players on offense are entitled to receive a forward pass.  Only an eligible pass receiver may legally catch a forward pass, and only an eligible receiver may advance beyond the neutral zone if a forward pass crosses the neutral zone.  If the pass is received by a non-eligible receiver, it is "illegal touching" (five yards and loss of down).   If an ineligible receiver is beyond the neutral zone when a forward pass crossing the neutral zone is thrown, a foul of "ineligible receiver downfield" (five yards, but no loss of down) is called. 

Enver Hoxha<====>10286<====>Enver Hoxha    Enver Halil Hoxha ( ; 16 October 1908 11 April 1985)  was an Albanian communist politician who served as the head of state of Albania from 1944 until his death in 1985, as the First Secretary of the Party of Labour of Albania.   He was chairman of the Democratic Front of Albania and commander-in-chief of the armed forces from 1944 until his death.  He served as the 22nd Prime Minister of Albania from 1944 to 1954 and at various times served as foreign minister and defence minister as well. Born in Gjirokastër in 1908, Hoxha became a teacher in grammar school in 1936. 

Hirohito<====>10287<====>Hirohito    Hirohito (April 29, 1901 – January 7, 1989) was the 124th Emperor of Japan according to the traditional order of succession, reigning from December 25, 1926, until his death.  He was succeeded by his eldest son, Akihito.  In Japan, he is now referred to primarily by his posthumous name, Emperor Shōwa.  The word Shōwa is the name of the era that corresponded with the Emperor's reign, and was made the Emperor's own name upon his death.  The name Hirohito means "abundant benevolence". At the start of his reign, Japan was already one of the great powers—the ninth-largest economy in the world, the third-largest naval power, and one of the four permanent members of the council of the League of Nations. 

Emsworth<====>10289<====>Emsworth   Emsworth is a small town    in Hampshire on the south coast of England, near the border of West Sussex.  It lies at the north end of an arm of Chichester Harbour, a large and shallow inlet from the English Channel.  Emsworth has a population of approximately 10,000.  The town has a basin for small yachts and fishing boats, which fills at high tide and can be emptied through a sluice at low tide. HistoryEarly EmsworthEmsworth began as a Saxon village.  At first it was linked to the settlement of Warblington nearby. 

Emulsion<====>10290<====>Emulsion  An emulsion is a mixture of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible (unmixable or unblendable).  Emulsions are part of a more general class of two-phase systems of matter called colloids.  Although the terms colloid and emulsion are sometimes used interchangeably, emulsion should be used when both phases, dispersed and continuous, are liquids.  In an emulsion, one liquid (the dispersed phase) is dispersed in the other (the continuous phase).  Examples of emulsions include vinaigrettes, homogenized milk, mayonnaise, and some cutting fluids for metal working.  Graphene and its modified forms are also a good example of recent unconventional surfactants helping in stabilizing emulsion systems. 

Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma<====>10292<====>Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma  Admiral of the Fleet Louis Francis Albert Victor Nicholas Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma,    .   (born Prince Louis of Battenberg; 25 June 1900 – 27 August 1979) was a British naval officer and statesman, an uncle of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and second cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth II.  During the Second World War, he was Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia Command (1943–46).  He was the last Viceroy of India (1947) and the first Governor-General of independent India (1947–48). From 1954 until 1959 he was First Sea Lord, a position that had been held by his father, Prince Louis of Battenberg, some forty years earlier. 

Elbridge Gerry<====>10293<====>Elbridge Gerry   Elbridge Gerry ( ; July 17, 1744 (O. S.  July 6, 1744) – November 23, 1814) was an American statesman and diplomat.  As a Democratic-Republican he served as the fifth Vice President of the United States from March 1813 until his death in November 1814.   He is known best for being the namesake of gerrymandering, a process by which electoral districts are drawn with the aim of aiding the party in power, although its initial "g" has recently softened to   from the hard   of his name.  Born into a wealthy merchant family, Gerry vocally opposed British colonial policy in the 1760s, and was active in the early stages of organizing the resistance in the American Revolutionary War. 

Encryption<====>10294<====>Encryption  In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding a message or information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it and those who are not authorized cannot.  Encryption does not itself prevent interference, but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor.  In an encryption scheme, the intended information or message, referred to as plaintext, is encrypted using an encryption algorithm – a cipher – generating ciphertext that can only be read if decrypted.  For technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually uses a pseudo-random encryption key generated by an algorithm.  It is in principle possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key, but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational resources and skills are required. 

EPR paradox<====>10296<====>EPR paradox  The Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox or EPR paradox   of 1935 is a thought experiment in quantum mechanics with which Albert Einstein and his colleagues Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen (EPR) claimed to demonstrate that the wave function does not provide a complete description of physical reality, and hence that the Copenhagen interpretation is unsatisfactory; resolutions of the paradox have important implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.  The essence of the paradox is that particles can interact in such a way that it is possible to measure both their position and their momentum more accurately than Heisenberg's uncertainty principle allows, unless measuring one particle instantaneously affects the other to prevent this accuracy, which would involve information being transmitted faster than light as forbidden by the theory of relativity ("spooky action at a distance"). 

Ethnologue<====>10302<====>Ethnologue   Ethnologue: Languages of the World is an annual reference publication in print and online that provides statistics and other information on the living languages of the world.   It was first issued in 1951, and is now published annually by SIL International, a U. S. -based, worldwide, Christian non-profit organization.   SIL's main purpose is to study, develop and document languages to promote literacy and for religious purposes.  As of 2017, Ethnologue contains web-based information on about 7,099 languages in its 20th edition,  including the number of speakers, location, dialects, linguistic affiliations, autonym, availability of the Bible in each language and dialect described, a cursory description of revitalization efforts where reported, and an estimate of language viability using the Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (EGIDS). 

Evaporation<====>10303<====>Evaporation   Evaporation is a type of vaporization of a liquid that occurs from the surface of a liquid into a gaseous phase that is not saturated with the evaporating substance.  The other type of vaporization is boiling, which is characterized by bubbles of saturated vapor forming in the liquid phase.   Steam produced in a boiler is another example of evaporation occurring in a saturated vapor phase.   Evaporation that occurs directly from the solid phase below the melting point, as commonly observed with ice at or below freezing or moth crystals (napthalene or paradichlorobenzene), is called sublimation. 

Esbat<====>10304<====>EsbatAn esbat   is a coven meeting at a time other than one of the Sabbats    within Wicca and other Wiccan-influenced forms of contemporary Paganism.  Janet and Stewart Farrar describe esbats as an opportunity for a "love feast, healing work, psychic training and all. " EtymologyThe term esbat is derived from Old French s'esbattre (Modern French ébat), meaning to frolic and amuse oneself, diversion.   It was a borrowing by 20th century anthropologist Margaret Murray's use of French witch trial sources on supposed Witches' Sabbaths in her attempts to "reconstruct" a Witch Cult in Western Europe. 

Equal temperament<====>10307<====>Equal temperament An equal temperament is a musical temperament, or a system of tuning, in which the frequency interval between every pair of adjacent notes has the same ratio.  In other words, there are equal ratios of the frequencies of any adjacent pair, and, since pitch is perceived roughly as the logarithm of frequency,  equal perceived "distance" from every note to its nearest neighbor. In equal temperament tunings, the generating interval is often found by dividing some larger desired interval, often the octave (ratio 2:1), into a number of smaller equal steps (equal frequency ratios between successive notes). 

Edward Gibbon<====>10310<====>Edward Gibbon   Edward Gibbon FRS ( ; 8 May 1737  16 January 1794)  was an English historian, writer and Member of Parliament.  His most important work, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, was published in six volumes between 1776 and 1788 and is known for the quality and irony of its prose, its use of primary sources, and its open criticism of organised religion .  Gibbon's central thesis, that Rome fell due to embracing Christianity, is no longer accepted in academia today.  Early life: 1737–1752Edward Gibbon was born in 1737, the son of Edward and Judith Gibbon at Lime Grove, in the town of Putney, Surrey. 

East Pakistan<====>10312<====>East Pakistan    East Pakistan was the eastern provincial wing of Pakistan between 1955 and 1971, covering the territory of the modern People’s Republic of Bangladesh.  Its land borders were with India and Burma, with a coastline on the Bay of Bengal.  East Pakistan was renamed from East Bengal by the One Unit scheme of Prime Minister Mohammad Ali of Bogra.  The Constitution of Pakistan of 1956 replaced the British monarchy with an Islamic republic.  Bengali politician H.  S.  Suhrawardy served as the Prime Minister of Pakistan between 1956 and 1957.  A Bengali bureaucrat Iskandar Mirza became the first President of Pakistan. 

E. O. Wilson<====>10313<====>E.  O.  Wilson Edward Osborne Wilson (born June 10, 1929), usually cited as E.  O.  Wilson, is an American biologist, researcher, theorist, naturalist and author.  His biological specialty is myrmecology, the study of ants, on which he has been called the world's leading expert.   Wilson has been called "the father of sociobiology" and "the father of biodiversity",    his environmental advocacy, and his secular-humanist and deist ideas pertaining to religious and ethical matters.Among his greatest contributions to ecological theory is the theory of island biogeography, which he developed in collaboration with the mathematical ecologist Robert MacArthur, which was the foundation of the development of conservation area design, as well as the unified neutral theory of biodiversity of Stephen Hubbell. 

Edwin Howard Armstrong<====>10315<====>Edwin Howard Armstrong  Edwin Howard Armstrong (December 18, 1890 – January 31, 1954) was an American electrical engineer and inventor, best known for developing FM (frequency modulation) radio and the superheterodyne receiver system.  He held 42 patents and received numerous awards, including the first Medal of Honor awarded by the Institute of Radio Engineers (now IEEE), the French Legion of Honor, the 1941 Franklin Medal and the 1942 Edison Medal.  He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame and included in the International Telecommunication Union's roster of great inventors. Early lifeArmstrong was born in the Chelsea district of New York City, the oldest of John and Emily (Smith) Armstrong's three children.

It was the second commercially viable MMORPG to be released, after Tibia, and the first commercially successful MMORPG to employ a three-dimensional game engine. EverQuest has had a wide influence on subsequent releases within the market, and holds an important position in the history of massively multiplayer online games.   The game surpassed early subscription expectations and grew for many years after its release.  It has received awards, including 1999 GameSpot Game of the Year and a 2007 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award. 

Human evolution<====>10326<====>Human evolutionHuman evolution is the evolutionary process that led to the emergence of anatomically modern humans, beginning with the evolutionary history of primates – in particular genus Homo – and leading to the emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct species of the hominid family, the great apes.  This process involved the gradual development of traits such as  human bipedalism and language.    The study of human evolution involves many scientific disciplines, including physical anthropology, primatology, archaeology, paleontology, neurobiology, ethology, linguistics, evolutionary psychology, embryology and genetics.   Genetic studies show that primates diverged from other mammals about  , in the Late Cretaceous period, and the earliest fossils appear in the Paleocene, around  . 

Evliya Çelebi<====>10328<====>Evliya Çelebi  Mehmed Zilli (25 March 1611 – 1682), known as Evliya Çelebi ( ), was an Ottoman explorer who travelled through the territory of the Ottoman Empire and neighboring lands over a period of forty years, recording his commentary in a travelogue called the Seyahatname ("Book of Travel").The name Çelebi is an honorific title meaning gentleman (see pre-1934 Turkish naming conventions). LifeEvliya Çelebi was born in Constantinople (now Istanbul) in 1611 to a wealthy family from Kütahya.  Both his parents were attached to the Ottoman court, his father, Derviş Mehmed Zilli, as a jeweller, and his mother as an Abkhazian relation of the grand vizier Melek Ahmed Pasha. 

Ancient Egyptian religion<====>10331<====>Ancient Egyptian religion   Ancient Egyptian religion was a complex system of polytheistic beliefs and rituals which were an integral part of ancient Egyptian society.   It centered on the Egyptians' interaction with many deities who were believed to be present in, and in control of, the forces of nature.  Rituals such as prayers and offerings were efforts to provide for the gods and gain their favor.  Formal religious practice centered on the pharaoh, the king of Egypt, who was believed to possess a divine power by virtue of his position.  He acted as the intermediary between his people and the gods and was obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain order in the universe. 

Educational psychology<====>10332<====>Educational psychology Educational psychology is the branch of psychology concerned with the scientific study of human learning.  The study of learning processes, from both cognitive and behavioral perspectives, allows researchers to understand individual differences in intelligence, cognitive development, affect, motivation, self-regulation, and self-concept, as well as their role in learning.  The field of educational psychology relies heavily on quantitative methods, including testing and measurement, to enhance educational activities related to instructional design, classroom management, and assessment, which serve to facilitate learning processes in various educational settings across the lifespan.

EFTPOS<====>10333<====>EFTPOS Electronic funds transfer at point of sale (EFTPOS  ) is an electronic payment system involving electronic funds transfers based on the use of payment cards, such as debit or credit cards, at payment terminals located at points of sale.  EFTPOS technology originated in the United States in 1981 and was adopted by other countries.   In Australia and New Zealand, it is also the brand name of a specific system used for such payments; these systems are mainly country specific and do not interconnect. Debit and credit cards are embossed plastic cards complying with ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1 standard. 

Epistle to the Laodiceans<====>10334<====>Epistle to the Laodiceans The Epistle to the Laodiceans is a possible lost letter of Paul the Apostle, the original existence of which is inferred from an instruction to the church in Colossae to send their letter to the church in Laodicea, and likewise obtain a copy of the letter "from Laodicea" (Greek ek laodikeas ἐκ Λαοδικείας).Several ancient texts purporting to be the missing "Epistle to the Laodiceans" have been known to have existed, most of which are now lost.  These were generally considered, both at the time and by modern scholarship, to be attempts to supply a forged copy of a lost document. 

Extermination camp<====>10335<====>Extermination camp   Nazi Germany built extermination camps (also called death camps or killing centers) during World War II (1939–45) to systematically kill millions of Jews, Slavs, Communists, and others whom the Nazis considered "Untermenschen" ("subhumans").  The victims of what became known as The Holocaust were primarily killed by gassing, but also in mass executions and through extreme work under starvation conditions.  The idea of mass extermination with the use of stationary facilities built exclusively for that purpose was a result of earlier Nazi experimentation with the chemically manufactured poison gas during the secretive Action T4 euthanasia programme against hospital patients with mental and physical disabilities.

Excommunication<====>10338<====>Excommunication  Excommunication is an institutional act of religious censure used to deprive, suspend, or limit membership in a religious community or to restrict certain rights within it, in particular receiving of the sacraments.  The term is often historically used to refer specifically to Catholic excommunications from the Catholic Church, but it is also used more generally to refer to similar types of institutional religious exclusionary practices and shunning among other religious groups.  For instance, many Protestant denominations have similar practices of excusing congregants from church communities, while Jehovah's Witnesses, as well as the Churches of Christ, use the term "disfellowship" to refer to their form of excommunication. 

Electrochemical cell<====>10339<====>Electrochemical cell An electrochemical cell is a device capable of either generating electrical energy from chemical reactions or facilitating chemical reactions through the introduction of electrical energy.  A common example of an electrochemical cell is a standard 1. 5 - volt  cell meant for consumer use.   This type of device is known as a single galvanic cell.   A battery consists of one or more cells, connected in either parallel or series pattern.  Half-cellsAn electrochemical cell consists of two half-cells.  Each half-cell consists of an electrode and an electrolyte.  The two half-cells may use the same electrolyte, or they may use different electrolytes. 

Ecdysis<====>10340<====>Ecdysis  Ecdysis is the moulting of the cuticle in many invertebrates of the clade Ecdysozoa.  Since the cuticle of these animals typically forms a largely inelastic exoskeleton, it is shed during growth and a new, larger covering is formed.The remnants of the old, empty exoskeleton are called exuviae.    After moulting, an arthropod is described as teneral, a callow; it is "fresh", pale and soft-bodied.  Within one or two hours, the cuticle hardens and darkens following a tanning process analogous to the production of leather.During this short phase the animal expands, since growth is otherwise constrained by the rigidity of the exoskeleton. 

Ebor, New South Wales<====>10343<====>Ebor, New South Wales  Ebor is a village on Waterfall Way on the Northern Tablelands in New South Wales, Australia.  It is situated about   east of Armidale and about a third of the way between Armidale and the coast.  Dorrigo to the east is   away with the Coffs Coast   beyond along the Waterfall Way. At the latest Census, Ebor and the surrounding area had a population of 166.  In the 2006 census, Ebor and the surrounding area had a population of 160.Facilities and featuresThere is a post office, Fusspots coffee shop/cafe, Fuel Station and Shop (Fuel available 24/7 self serve), Hotel/Motel and a primary school. 

Ancient history of Afghanistan<====>10344<====>Ancient history of Afghanistan Archaeological exploration of the pre-Islamic period of Afghanistan began in Afghanistan in earnest after World War II and proceeded until the late 1970s when the nation was invaded by the Soviet Union.  Archaeologists and historians suggest that humans were living in Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities of the region were among the earliest in the world.Urbanized culture has existed in the land from between 3000 and 2000 BC.    Artifacts typical of the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron ages have been found inside Afghanistan. 

Gravitational redshift<====>10346<====>Gravitational redshiftIn astrophysics, gravitational redshift or Einstein shift is the process by which electromagnetic radiation originating from a source that is in a gravitational field is reduced in frequency, or redshifted, when observed in a region at a higher gravitational potential.  This is a direct result of gravitational time dilation—if one is outside an isolated gravitational source, the rate at which time passes increases as one moves away from that source.  As frequency is inverse of time (specifically, time required for completing one wave oscillation), frequency of the electromagnetic radiation is reduced in an area of higher gravitational potential. 

Easter Rising<====>10350<====>Easter Rising    The Easter Rising ( ),  also known as the Easter Rebellion, was an armed insurrection in Ireland during Easter Week, April 1916.  The Rising was launched by Irish republicans to end British rule in Ireland and establish an independent Irish Republic while the United Kingdom was heavily engaged in the First World War.  It was the most significant uprising in Ireland since the rebellion of 1798, and the first armed action of the Irish revolutionary period. Organised by a seven-man Military Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, Leaders and Men of the Easter Rising: Dublin 1916Francis X. 

Eschrichtiidae<====>10353<====>Eschrichtiidae Eschrichtiidae or the gray whales is a family of baleen whale (suborder Mysticeti) with a single extant species, the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus).   The family, however, also includes three described fossil genera: Archaeschrichtius and Eschrichtioides from the Miocene and Pliocene of Italy respectively,  and Gricetoides from the Pliocene of North Carolina.    The names of the extant genus and the family honours Danish zoologist Daniel Eschricht.  Taxonomic historyA number of 18th century authors  described the gray whale as Balaena gibbosa, the "whale with six bosses", apparently based on a brief note by  :    The gray whale was first described as a distinct species by   based on a subfossil found in the brackish Baltic Sea, apparently a specimen from the now extinct north Atlantic population. 

Edmund I<====>10354<====>Edmund I Edmund I ( , pronounced  ; 921 – 26 May 946) was King of the English from 939 until his death.  His epithets include the Elder, the Deed-doer, the Just, and the Magnificent. Edmund was the son of Edward the Elder and his third wife Eadgifu of Kent, and a grandson of Alfred the Great.  His father died when he was young, and was succeeded by his oldest son Æthelstan.  Edmund came to the throne upon the death of his half-brother in 939, apparently with little opposition.  His reign was marked by almost constant warfare, including conquests or reconquests of the Midlands, Northumbria, and Strathclyde (the last of which was ceded to Malcolm I of Scotland). 

Endothermic process<====>10356<====>Endothermic process The term endothermic process describes a process or reaction in which the system absorbs energy from its surroundings; usually, but not always, in the form of heat.  The term was coined by Marcellin Berthelot from the Greek roots endo-, derived from the word "endon" (ἔνδον) meaning "within" and the root "therm" (θερμ-) meaning "hot. " The intended sense is that of a reaction that depends on absorbing heat if it is to proceed.  The opposite of an endothermic process is an exothermic process, one that releases, "gives out" energy in the form of   heat. 

Earle Page<====>10357<====>Earle Page    Sir Earle Christmas Grafton Page,   (8 August 1880 20 December 1961) was an Australian politician who served as the Prime Minister of Australia for a brief period in April 1939, holding office in a caretaker capacity after the death of Joseph Lyons.  He led the Country Party from 1921 to 1939, and served as a cabinet minister under six different prime ministers. Page was born in Grafton, New South Wales.  He entered the University of Sydney at the age of 14, and completed his medical degree at the age of 20. 

Ephrem the Syrian<====>10358<====>Ephrem the Syrian   Ephrem the Syrian (  Mār Aprêm Sûryāyâ;  Greek:  ;  , also known as St.  Ephraem (Ephrem, Ephraim); c.  306 – 373) was a Syriac Christian deacon and a prolific Syriac-language hymnographer and theologian of the 4th century. He is especially beloved in the Syriac Orthodox Church, and counted as a Venerable Father (i. e. , a sainted Monk) in Eastern Orthodoxy.  His feast day is celebrated on 28 January and on the Saturday of the Venerable Fathers.  He was declared a Doctor of the Church in the Catholic Church in 1920. 

Amiga Enhanced Chip Set<====>10359<====>Amiga Enhanced Chip Set The Enhanced Chip Set (ECS) is the second generation of the Amiga computer's chipset, offering minor improvements over the original chipset (OCS) design.  ECS was introduced in 1990 with the launch of the Amiga 3000.  Amigas produced from 1990 onwards featured a mix of OCS and ECS chips, such as later versions of the Amiga 500 and the Commodore CDTV.  Other ECS models were the Amiga 500+ in 1991 and lastly the Amiga 600 in 1992.  Notable improvements were the Super Agnus and the Hires Denise chips.  The sound and floppy controller chip, Paula, remained unchanged from the OCS design. 

European Space Operations Centre<====>10361<====>European Space Operations Centre  The European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) serves as the main mission control centre for the European Space Agency (ESA) and is located in Darmstadt, Germany.  ESOC's primary function is the operation of unmanned spacecraft on behalf of ESA and the launch and early orbit phases (LEOP) of ESA and third-party missions.   The Centre is also responsible for a range of operations-related activities within ESA and in cooperation with ESA's industry and international partners, including ground systems engineering, software development, flight dynamics and navigation, development of mission control tools and techniques and space debris studies. 

European Space Agency<====>10363<====>European Space Agency    The European Space Agency (ESA;  , ASE; ) is an intergovernmental organisation of 22 member states    dedicated to the exploration of space.  Established in 1975 and headquartered in Paris, France, ESA has a worldwide staff of about 2,000    and an annual budget of about €5. 25 billion / US$5. 77 billion (2016).  ESA's space flight programme includes human spaceflight (mainly through participation in the International Space Station programme); the launch and operation of unmanned exploration missions to other planets and the Moon; Earth observation, science and telecommunication; designing launch vehicles; and maintaining a major spaceport, the Guiana Space Centre at Kourou, French Guiana. 

Embouchure<====>10365<====>Embouchure Embouchure or lipping  is the use of the lips, facial muscles, tongue, and teeth in playing a wind instrument.  This includes shaping the lips to the mouthpiece of a woodwind instrument or the mouthpiece of a brass instrument.  The word is of French origin and is related to the root  , 'mouth'.  Proper embouchure allows instrumentalists to play their instrument at its full range with a full, clear tone and without strain or damage to their muscles. Brass embouchureWhile performing on a brass instrument, the sound is produced by the player buzzing his or her lips into a mouthpiece. 

The Elephant 6 Recording Company<====>10368<====>The Elephant 6 Recording Company   The Elephant 6 Recording Company (or simply Elephant 6) is a collective of American musicians who spawned many notable independent bands of the 1990s, including the Apples in Stereo, the Olivia Tremor Control, Neutral Milk Hotel, Beulah, Elf Power, of Montreal, The Minders, and Circulatory System.   They are marked by a shared admiration of 1960s pop music.    HistoryFoundationThe collective was founded in Denver, Colorado by childhood friends Robert Schneider, Bill Doss, Will Cullen Hart and Jeff Mangum, along with founding Apples in Stereo members Jim McIntyre and Hilarie Sidney. 

Evangelicalism<====>10370<====>Evangelicalism    Evangelicalism ( ), evangelical Christianity, or evangelical Protestantism,  is a worldwide, trans-denominational movement within Protestant Christianity which maintains the belief that the essence of the Gospel consists of the doctrine of salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ's atonement. Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or the "born again" experience in receiving salvation, in the authority of the Bible as God's revelation to humanity, and in spreading the Christian message.  The movement has had a long presence in the Anglosphere before spreading beyond it in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. 

Euphonium<====>10371<====>Euphonium   The euphonium is a large, conical-bore, baritone-voiced brass instrument that derives its name from the Ancient Greek word   euphōnos,    meaning "well-sounding" or "sweet-voiced" (  eu means "well" or "good" and   phōnē means "sound", hence "of good sound").  The euphonium is a valved instrument; nearly all current models are piston valved, though rotary valved models do exist.  Outside of Brass Bands (in the British tradition where the instrument plays in B♭ and in treble clef) the euphonium is a non-transposing instrument.  A person who plays the euphonium is sometimes called a euphoniumist, euphophonist, or a euphonist, while British players often colloquially refer to themselves as euphists, or euphologists. 

Entire function<====>10372<====>Entire functionIn complex analysis, an entire function, also called an integral function, is a complex-valued function that is holomorphic at all finite points over the whole complex plane.  Typical examples of entire functions are polynomials and the exponential function, and any finite sums, products and compositions of these, such as the trigonometric functions sine and cosine and their hyperbolic counterparts sinh and cosh, as well as derivatives and integrals of entire functions such as the error function.  If an entire function f(z) has a root at w, then f(z)/(z−w), taking the limit value at w, is an entire function. 

Essay<====>10374<====>EssayAn essay is, generally, a piece of writing that gives the author's own argument — but the definition is vague, overlapping with those of a paper, an article, a pamphlet, and a short story.  Essays have traditionally been sub-classified as formal and informal.  Formal essays are characterized by "serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length," whereas the informal essay is characterized by "the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme," etc.  Essays are commonly used as literary criticism, political manifestos, learned arguments, observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. 

Error detection and correction<====>10375<====>Error detection and correction  In information theory and coding theory with applications in computer science and telecommunication, error detection and correction or error control are techniques that enable reliable delivery of digital data over unreliable communication channels.  Many communication channels are subject to channel noise,  and thus errors may be introduced during transmission from the source to a receiver.  Error detection techniques allow detecting such errors, while error correction enables reconstruction of the original data in many cases. DefinitionsThe general definitions of the terms are as follows:Error detection  is the detection of errors caused by noise or other impairments during transmission from the transmitter to the receiver. 

Euclidean domain<====>10376<====>Euclidean domainIn mathematics, more specifically in abstract algebra and ring theory, a Euclidean domain (also called a Euclidean ring) is a commutative ring that can be endowed with a Euclidean function (explained below) which allows a suitable generalization of the Euclidean division of the integers.   This generalized Euclidean algorithm can be put to many of the same uses as Euclid's original algorithm in the ring of integers: in any Euclidean domain, one can apply the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor of any two elements.   In particular, the greatest common divisor of any two elements exists and can be written as a linear combination of them (Bézout's identity). 

Euclidean algorithm<====>10377<====>Euclidean algorithm  In mathematics, the Euclidean algorithm , or Euclid's algorithm, is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.  It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, who first described it in Euclid's Elements (c.  300 BC). It is an example of an algorithm, a step-by-step procedure for performing a calculation according to well-defined rules,and is one of the oldest algorithms in common use.  It can be used to reduce fractions to their simplest form, and is a part of many other number-theoretic and cryptographic calculations. 

European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts<====>10378<====>European Centre for Medium-Range Weather ForecastsThe European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is an independent intergovernmental organisation supported by most of the nations of Europe and is based at Shinfield Park, Reading, United Kingdom. It operates one of the largest supercomputer complexes in Europe and the world's largest archive of numerical weather prediction data.    ECMWF was established in 1975, in recognition of the need to pool the scientific and technical resources of Europe's meteorological services and institutions for the production of weather forecasts for medium-range timescales (up to approximately two weeks) and of the economic and social benefits expected from it. 

European Broadcasting Union<====>10380<====>European Broadcasting Union    The European Broadcasting Union (EBU;  ) is an alliance of public service media organisations, established on 12 February 1950.  The organisation is made up of 73 Members in 56 countries,    and 34 Associate Members from a further 20 countries.It is best known for producing the Eurovision Song Contest.  It also hosted debates between candidates for the European Commission presidency for the 2014 parliamentary elections but is unrelated to the institution itself.   General descriptionEBU Members are public service broadcasters whose output is made, financed and controlled by the public, for the public. 

Electrothermal-chemical technology<====>10382<====>Electrothermal-chemical technologyElectrothermal-chemical (ETC) technology is an attempt to increase accuracy and muzzle energy of future tank, artillery, and close-in weapon system  guns by improving the predictability and rate of expansion of propellants inside the barrel. An electrothermal-chemical gun uses a plasma cartridge to ignite and control the ammunition's propellant, using electrical energy to trigger the process.   ETC increases the performance of conventional solid propellants, reduces the effect of temperature on propellant expansion and allows for more advanced, higher density propellants to be used. The technology has been under development since the mid-1980s and at present is actively being researched in the United States by the Army Research Laboratory and private organizations. 

Boeing E-3 Sentry<====>10384<====>Boeing E-3 Sentry   The Boeing E-3 Sentry, commonly known as AWACS, is an American airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft developed by Boeing.  Derived from the Boeing 707, it provides all-weather surveillance, command, control, and communications, and is used by the United States Air Force, NATO, Royal Air Force, French Air Force, and Royal Saudi Air Force.  The E-3 is distinguished by the distinctive rotating radar dome above the fuselage.  Production ended in 1992 after 68 aircraft had been built. In the mid-1960s, the US Air Force (USAF) was seeking an aircraft to replace its piston-engined Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star, which had been in service for over a decade. 

Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS<====>10385<====>Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS  The Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) is a United States Air Force Airborne ground surveillance, battle management and command and control aircraft.  It tracks ground vehicles and some aircraft, collects imagery, and relays tactical pictures to ground and air theater commanders.   The aircraft is operated by both active duty Air Force and Air National Guard units and also carries specially trained U. S.  Army personnel as additional flight crew. DevelopmentJoint STARS evolved from separate United States Army and Air Force programs to develop technology to detect, locate and attack enemy armor at ranges beyond the forward area of troops. 

Eric Cheney<====>10388<====>Eric Cheney   Eric Cheney (5 January 1924 – 30 December 2001) was an English motorcycle racer, designer and independent constructor.  He was known as one of the best motorcycle frame designers of his era, concentrating mainly in the off-road competition aftermarket.    Early lifeCheney attended the Lancasterian School in Winchester before joining the Royal Navy at the age of 18, where he served on wartime Arctic convoys and in motor torpedo boats and gained experience of engineering and working on high performance engines.    Cheney also worked on the development of remote controlled submarines for the Royal Navy. 

Econometrics<====>10390<====>Econometrics    Econometrics is the application of statistical methods to economic data and is described as the branch of economics that aims to give empirical content to economic relations.  M.  Hashem Pesaran (1987).  "Econometrics," The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, v.  2, p.  8 [pp.  8–22].  Reprinted in J.  Eatwell et al. , eds.  (1990).  Econometrics: The New Palgrave, p.  1 [pp.  1–34].   Abstract (2008 revision by J.  Geweke, J.  Horowitz, and H.  P.  Pesaran).   More precisely, it is "the quantitative analysis of actual economic phenomena based on the concurrent development of theory and observation, related by appropriate methods of inference". 

Ellen van Langen<====>10391<====>Ellen van Langen   Ellen Gezina Maria van Langen (born February 9, 1966) is a Dutch former middle distance runner, who specialised in the 800 metres.  She is the 1992 Olympic Champion. CareerVan Langen was born in Oldenzaal, Overijssel.  She has a degree in economics from the University of Amsterdam.  Before she started running she played football.  In 1989, she won a silver medal behind Ana Quirot at the World Student Games (Universiade), running 1:59. 82.  In 1990, she finished fourth in the final of the European Championships in Split, with 1:57. 

Emacs Lisp<====>10392<====>Emacs Lisp Emacs Lisp is a dialect of the Lisp programming language used as a scripting language by Emacs (a text editor family most commonly associated with GNU Emacs and XEmacs).  It is used  for implementing most of the editing functionality built into Emacs, the remainder being written in C (as is the Lisp interpreter itself).  Emacs Lisp is also referred to as Elisp, although there is also an older, unrelated Lisp dialect with that name.  Users of Emacs commonly write Emacs Lisp code to customize and extend Emacs.   Other options include the "Customize" feature that's been in GNU Emacs since version 20. 

Edward Bulwer-Lytton<====>10393<====>Edward Bulwer-Lytton   Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton, PC (25 May 1803 – 18 January 1873) was an English novelist, poet, playwright, and politician.  He was immensely popular with the reading public and wrote a stream of bestselling novels which earned him a considerable fortune.  He coined the phrases  "the great unwashed", "pursuit of the almighty dollar", "the pen is mightier than the sword", "dweller on the threshold", and the well-known opening line "It was a dark and stormy night".  LifeBulwer-Lytton was born on 25 May 1803 to General William Earle Bulwer of Heydon Hall and Wood Dalling, Norfolk and Elizabeth Barbara Lytton, daughter of Richard Warburton Lytton of Knebworth, Hertfordshire. 

History of Esperanto<====>10400<====>History of Esperanto  L.  L.  Zamenhof developed Esperanto in the 1870s and 80s and published the first publication about it, Unua Libro, in 1887.  The number of Esperanto speakers has grown gradually since then, although it has not had much support from governments and international organizations and has sometimes been outlawed or otherwise suppressed. Standardized YiddishAround 1880, while in Moscow and approximately simultaneously with working on Esperanto, Zamenhof made an aborted attempt to standardize Yiddish, based on his native Bialystok (Northeastern) dialect, as a unifying language for the Jews of the Russian Empire.   He even used a Latin alphabet, with the letters ć, h́, ś, ź (the same as in early drafts of Esperanto, later ĉ, ĥ, ŝ, ĵ) and ě for schwa. 

Esperanto grammar<====>10402<====>Esperanto grammar  Esperanto is a constructed language.  Due to its highly regular grammar, one often says that Esperanto is easier to learn than other languages. Each part of speech has a unique suffix: nouns end with ‑o; adjectives with ‑a; present‑tense indicative verbs with ‑as, and so on. It is possible to communicate effectively with a vocabulary of 400 to 500 "meaning words", though more exist in the language.  The original vocabulary of Esperanto had around 900 meaning words, but was quickly expanded. Reference grammars include the Plena Analiza Gramatiko (eo) ( ) by Kálmán Kalocsay and Gaston Waringhien, and the Plena Manlibro de Esperanta Gramatiko ( ) by Bertilo Wennergren. 

Esperanto culture<====>10404<====>Esperanto culture Esperanto speakers have their own culture, on top of being a "gateway" to the culture of the entire world (inherently more-so than most other dominant languages are) .  As examples, gufujoj exist, and Esperanto speakers will talk about what would normally be considered extremely touchy subjects without restraint (such as political talk or questions about racism),  even if they wouldn't do this in their home country or another language they know. In general, Esperanto culture places a huge focus on reading, education (especially of news, facts and languages from around the world), tolerance and acceptance (especially of people completely different from yourself). 

Emotion<====>10406<====>Emotion    Emotion is any conscious experience    characterized by intense mental activity and a certain degree of pleasure or displeasure.    Scientific discourse has drifted to other meanings and there is no consensus on a definition.  Emotion is often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, and motivation.   In some theories, cognition is an important aspect of emotion.  Those acting primarily on the emotions they are feeling may seem as if they are not thinking, but mental processes are still essential, particularly in the interpretation of events.  For example, the realization of our believing that we are in a dangerous situation and the subsequent arousal of our body's nervous system (rapid heartbeat and breathing, sweating, muscle tension) is integral to the experience of our feeling afraid. 

Epictetus<====>10407<====>Epictetus  Epictetus ( ;   , Epíktētos;    AD 55   135) was a Greek Stoic philosopher.  He was born a slave at Hierapolis, Phrygia (present day Pamukkale, Turkey) and lived in Rome until his banishment, when he went to Nicopolis in northwestern Greece for the rest of his life.  His teachings were written down and published by his pupil Arrian in his Discourses and Enchiridion. Epictetus taught that philosophy is a way of life and not just a theoretical discipline.  To Epictetus, all external events are  beyond our control; we should accept calmly and dispassionately whatever happens. 

Edward Lear<====>10408<====>Edward Lear  Edward Lear (12 or 13 May 1812   – 29 January 1888) was an English artist, illustrator, musician, author and poet, and is known now mostly for his literary nonsense in poetry and prose and especially his limericks, a form he popularised.  His principal areas of work as an artist were threefold: as a draughtsman employed to illustrate birds and animals; making coloured drawings during his journeys, which he reworked later, sometimes as plates for his travel books; as a (minor) illustrator of Alfred Tennyson's poems.  As an author, he is known principally for his popular nonsense collections of poems, songs, short stories, botanical drawings, recipes, and alphabets. 

Eve Arden<====>10409<====>Eve Arden Eve Arden (April 30, 1908 – November 12, 1990) was an American film, stage, and television actress, and comedian.  She performed in leading and supporting roles over nearly six decades. Beginning her career on Broadway in the early 1930s, Arden's first major role was in the RKO Radio Pictures drama Stage Door (1937) opposite Katharine Hepburn, followed by roles in the comedies Having Wonderful Time (1938) and At the Circus (1939), the latter starring the Marx Brothers.  Arden would go on to earn an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Mildred Pierce (1945). 

Elementary function<====>10412<====>Elementary function In mathematics, an elementary function is a function of one variable which is the composition of a finite number of arithmetic operations  , exponentials, logarithms, constants, and solutions of algebraic equations (a generalization of nth roots). The elementary functions include the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions and their inverses, as they are expressible with complex exponentials and logarithms. It follows directly from the definition that the set of elementary functions is closed under arithmetic operations and composition.  It is also closed under differentiation.  It is not closed under limits and infinite sums.  Importantly, the elementary functions are not closed under integration, as shown by Liouville's theorem, see Nonelementary integral. 

Enchiridion of Epictetus<====>10413<====>Enchiridion of Epictetus The Enchiridion or Manual of Epictetus ( , Enkheirídion Epiktḗtou) (enchiridion is Greek for "that which is held in the hand") is a short manual of Stoic ethical advice compiled by Arrian, a 2nd-century disciple of the Greek philosopher Epictetus. ContentAlthough the content is similar to the Discourses of Epictetus, it is not a summary of the Discourses but rather a compilation of practical precepts.  Eschewing metaphysics, Arrian focused his attention on Epictetus's work applying philosophy in daily life.  The primary theme is that one should accept what happens: However, "some things are up to us and some are not up to us"  and we must act accordingly, taking responsibility for planning and enacting what we can with virtue without becoming upset or disheartened by obstacles and reverses beyond our control.

It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire, as did all Romance languages.  French has evolved from Gallo-Romance, the spoken Latin in Gaul, and more specifically in Northern Gaul.  Its closest relatives are the other langues d'oïl—languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium, which French (Francien) has largely supplanted.  French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the (Germanic) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders. 

Formula fiction<====>10600<====>Formula fiction  In popular culture, formula fiction is literature in which the storylines and plots have been reused to the extent that the narratives are predictable.   It is similar to genre fiction, which identifies a number of specific settings that are frequently reused.   The label of formula fiction is used in literary criticism as a mild pejorative to imply lack of originality. Formula fiction is similar to genre fiction.  The label of genre fiction is typically assigned because of the reuse of settings, content, layout, and/or style.  The label of formula fiction is assigned because of the reuse of plot, plot devices and stock characters. 

Field (mathematics)<====>10603<====>Field (mathematics)   In mathematics, a field  is a set on which addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined, and behave as when they are applied to rational and real numbers.  A field is thus a fundamental algebraic structure, which is widely used in algebra, number theory and many other areas of mathematics. The best known fields are the field of rational numbers and the field of real numbers.  The field of complex numbers is also widely used, not only in mathematics, but also in many areas of science and engineering.  Many other fields, such as fields of rational functions, algebraic function fields, algebraic number fields, and p-adic fields are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and algebraic geometry.

For example, 5! = 5  \times  4  \times  3  \times  2  \times  1 = 120.   The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product. The factorial operation is encountered in many areas of mathematics, notably in combinatorics, algebra, and mathematical analysis. Its most basic occurrence is the fact that there are n! ways to arrange n distinct objects into a sequence (i.e., permutations of the set of objects). This fact was known at least as early as the 12th century, to Indian scholars.   Fabian Stedman, in 1677, described factorials as applied to change ringing.   After describing a recursive approach, Stedman gives a statement of a factorial (using the language of the original): Now the nature of these methods is such, that the changes on one number comprehends [includes] the changes on all lesser numbers, ... insomuch that a compleat Peal of changes on one number seemeth to be formed by uniting of the compleat Peals on all lesser numbers into one entire body;  The notation n !  was introduced by the French mathematician Christian Kramp in 1808. The definition of the factorial function can also be extended to non-integer arguments, while retaining its most important properties; this involves more advanced mathematics, notably techniques from mathematical analysis.DefinitionThe factorial function is formally defined by the product \begin{align}n! & = \prod_{k=1}^n k \\  & = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdots (n-2) \cdot (n-1) \cdot n \\  & = n (n-1)(n-2) \cdots (2)(1) \\\end{align} initially for integer  , and resulting in this fundamental recurrence relation:  (n+1)! = (n+1) \cdot n!  .E.g.: \begin{align}5! &= 5 \cdot 4! \\6! &=  6 \cdot  5! \\50! &= 50 \cdot 49! \\\end{align} 0!In order for this recurrence relation to be extended to n=0, it is necessary to define 0! = 1  so that 1! = 1 \cdot 0! = 1 \ . Other consequences that indicate defining  0! = 1   and the convention that the product of no numbers at all is 1 are:There is exactly one permutation of zero objects (with nothing to permute, "everything" is left in place).It makes many identities in combinatorics valid for all applicable sizes. The number of ways to choose 0 elements from the empty set is  \tbinom{0}{0} = \tfrac{0!}{0!0!} = 1  .More generally, the number of ways to choose (all) n elements among a set of n is \tbinom{n}{n} = \tfrac{n!}{n!0!} = 1  .It allows for the compact expression of many formulae, such as the exponential function, as a power series:  e^x = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}. Factorial of a non-integerThe factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values using more advanced mathematics (the gamma function   n! = \Gamma(n+1)  ), detailed in the section below. This more generalized definition is used by advanced calculators and mathematical software such as Maple or Mathematica.ApplicationsAlthough the factorial function has its roots in combinatorics, formulas involving factorials occur in many areas of mathematics.There are n! different ways of arranging n distinct objects into a sequence, the permutations of those objects.    Often factorials appear in the denominator of a formula to account for the fact that ordering is to be ignored. A classical example is counting k-combinations (subsets of k elements) from a set with n elements. One can obtain such a combination by choosing a k-permutation: successively selecting and removing an element of the set, k times, for a total of n^{\underline k}=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-k+1) possibilities. This however produces the k-combinations in a particular order that one wishes to ignore; since each k-combination is obtained in k! different ways, the correct number of k-combinations is \frac{n^{\underline k}}{k!}=\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots(1)}. This number is known    as the binomial coefficient  \tbinom nk , because it is also the coefficient of X k  in  .Factorials occur in algebra for various reasons, such as via the already mentioned coefficients of the binomial formula, or through averaging over permutations for symmetrization of certain operations.Factorials also turn up in calculus; for example, they occur in the denominators of the terms of Taylor's formula,  where they are used as compensation terms due to the n-th derivative of x n  being equivalent to n ! .Factorials are also used extensively in probability theory. Factorials can be useful to facilitate expression manipulation. For instance the number of k-permutations of n can be written as n^{\underline k}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}; while this is inefficient as a means to compute that number, it may serve to prove a symmetry property   of binomial coefficients: \binom nk=\frac{n^{\underline k}}{k!}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!} = \frac{n^{\underline{n-k}}}{(n-k)!} = \binom n{n-k}. The factorial function can be shown, using the power rule, to be \begin{align}n! &= D^n(x^n) \\  &= \frac{d^n}{dx^n}(x^n) \\\end{align} where  D^nx^n  is the Euler's notation for the nth derivative of  x^n .  Rate of growth and approximations for large nAs n grows, the factorial n !  increases faster than all polynomials and exponential functions (but slower than double exponential functions) in n.Most approximations for n! are based on approximating its natural logarithm \ln n! = \sum_{x=1}^n \ln x. The graph of the function f(n) = ln n! is shown in the figure on the right. It looks approximately linear for all reasonable values of n, but this intuition is false.We get one of the simplest approximations for ln n! by bounding the sum with an integral from above and below as follows:  \int_1^n \ln x \, dx \leq \sum_{x=1}^n \ln x \leq \int_0^n \ln (x+1) \, dx which gives us the estimate  n\ln\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)+1 \leq \ln n! \leq (n+1)\ln\left( \frac{n+1}{e} \right) + 1. Hence  \ln n! \sim n\ln n  (see Big O notation). This result plays a key role in the analysis of the computational complexity of sorting algorithms (see comparison sort). From the bounds on ln n! deduced above we get that e\left(\frac ne\right)^n \leq n! \leq e\left(\frac{n+1}e\right)^{n+1}. It is sometimes practical to use weaker but simpler estimates. Using the above formula it is easily shown that for all n we have  (n/3)^n  , and for all n ≥ 6 we have  n!  .For large n we get a better estimate for the number n !  using Stirling's approximation: n!\sim\sqrt{2\pi n}\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n. This in fact comes from an asymptotic series for the logarithm, and n factorial lies between this and the next approximation: \sqrt{2\pi n}\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n Another approximation for   is given by Srinivasa Ramanujan   \ln n! \approx n\ln n - n + \frac {\ln(n(1+4n(1+2n)))}{6} + \frac {\ln(\pi)}{2} or n!\approx\sqrt{2\pi n}\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n[1 +1/(2n) +1/(8n^2)]^{1/6}. Both this and  \sqrt{2\pi n}\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^ne^\frac 1{12n}  give a relative error on the order of 1/n 3 , but Ramanujan's is about four times more accurate. However, if we use two correction terms (as in Ramanujan's approximation) the relative error will be of order 1/n 5 : n!\approx\sqrt{2\pi n}\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n\exp\left({\frac 1{12n}-\frac 1{360n^3}}\right) ComputationIf efficiency is not a concern, computing factorials is trivial from an algorithmic point of view: successively multiplying a variable initialized to 1 by the integers up to n (if any) will compute n ! , provided the result fits in the variable. In functional languages, the recursive definition is often implemented directly to illustrate recursive functions.The main practical difficulty in computing factorials is the size of the result. To assure that the exact result will fit for all legal values of even the smallest commonly used integral type (8-bit signed integers) would require more than 700 bits, so no reasonable specification of a factorial function using fixed-size types can avoid questions of overflow. The values 12! and 20! are the largest factorials that can be stored in, respectively, the 32-bit and 64-bit integers commonly used in personal computers, however many languages support variable length integer types capable of calculating very large values.  Floating-point representation of an approximated result allows going a bit further, but this also remains quite limited by possible overflow. Most calculators use scientific notation with 2-digit decimal exponents, and the largest factorial that fits is then 69!, because 69!  100   !  for values of n up to 249999, and up to 20,000,000! for the integers.If the exact values of large factorials are needed, they can be computed using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Instead of doing the sequential multiplications  ((1 \times 2) \times 3) \times 4 \times\cdots , a program can partition the sequence into two parts, whose products are roughly the same size, and multiply them using a divide-and-conquer method. This is often more efficient. The asymptotically best efficiency is obtained by computing n !  from its prime factorization. As documented by Peter Borwein, prime factorization allows n !  to be computed in time O(n(log n log log n) 2 ), provided that a fast multiplication algorithm is used (for example, the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm).  Peter Luschny presents source code and benchmarks for several efficient factorial algorithms, with or without the use of a prime sieve. Number theoryFactorials have many applications in number theory. In particular, n !  is necessarily divisible by all prime numbers up to and including n. As a consequence, n > 5 is a composite number if and only if (n-1)!\ \equiv\ 0 \pmod n. A stronger result is Wilson's theorem, which states that (p-1)!\ \equiv\ -1 \pmod p if and only if p is prime.  Legendre's formula gives the multiplicity of the prime p occurring in the prime factorization of  n!  as \sum_{i=1}^\infty \left \lfloor \frac n {p^i} \right \rfloor or, equivalently,  \frac{n - s_p(n)}{p - 1}, where  s_p(n)  denotes the sum of the standard base-p digits of n.Adding 1 to a factorial n! yields a number that is divisible by a prime larger than n. This fact can be used to prove Euclid's theorem that the number of primes is infinite.   Primes of the form n! ± 1 are called factorial primes.Series of reciprocalsThe reciprocals of factorials produce a convergent series whose sum is Euler's number e: \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{24}  + \frac{1}{120} + \cdots = e\,. Although the sum of this series is an irrational number, it is possible to multiply the factorials by positive integers to produce a convergent series with a rational sum: \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac 1 {(n+2)n!} = \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{30} + \frac{1}{144} + \cdots=1\,. The convergence of this series to 1 can be seen from the fact that its partial sums are less than one by an inverse factorial.Therefore, the factorials do not form an irrationality sequence. Extension of factorial to non-integer values of argumentThe Gamma and Pi functions Besides nonnegative integers, the factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values, but this requires more advanced tools from mathematical analysis. One function that "fills in" the values of the factorial (but with a shift of 1 in the argument) is called the Gamma function, denoted Γ(z), defined for all complex numbers z except the non-positive integers, and given when the real part of z is positive by \Gamma(z)=\int_0^\infty t^{z-1} e^{-t}\, \mathrm{d}t.  Its relation to the factorials is that for any natural number n n!=\Gamma(n+1). Euler's original formula for the Gamma function was \Gamma(z)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n^zn!}{\displaystyle\prod_{k=0}^n (z+k)}.  An alternative notation, originally introduced by Gauss, is sometimes used.  The Pi function, denoted Π(z) for real numbers z no less than 0, is defined by \Pi(z)=\int_0^\infty t^z e^{-t}\, \mathrm{d}t\,. In terms of the Gamma function it is \Pi(z) = \Gamma(z+1) \,. It truly extends the factorial in that \Pi(n) = n! \text{ for } n \in \mathbf{N}\, . In addition to this, the Pi function satisfies the same recurrence as factorials do, but at every complex value z where it is defined \Pi(z) = z\Pi(z-1)\,. In fact, this is no longer a recurrence relation but a functional equation.Expressed in terms of the Gamma function this functional equation takes the form \Gamma(n+1)=n\Gamma(n)\,. Since the factorial is extended by the Pi function, for every complex value z where it is defined, we can write: z! = \Pi(z) The values of these functions at half-integer values is therefore determined by a single one of them; one has \Gamma\left (\frac{1}{2}\right )=\left (-\frac{1}{2}\right )!=\Pi\left (-\frac{1}{2}\right ) = \sqrt{\pi}, from which it follows that for n ∈ N, \begin{align}& \Gamma\left (\frac{1}{2}+n\right ) = \left (-\frac{1}{2}+n\right )! = \Pi\left (-\frac{1}{2}+n\right ) \\[5pt]= {} & \sqrt{\pi} \prod_{k=1}^n {2k - 1 \over 2} = {(2n)! \over 4^n n!} \sqrt{\pi} = {(2n-1)! \over 2^{2n-1}(n-1)!} \sqrt{\pi}.\end{align} For example, \Gamma(4.5) = 3.5! = \Pi(3.5) = {1\over 2}\cdot{3\over 2}\cdot{5\over 2} \cdot {7\over 2} \sqrt{\pi} = {8! \over 4^4 4!} \sqrt{\pi} = {7! \over 2^7 3!} \sqrt{\pi} = {105 \over 16} \sqrt{\pi} \approx 11.63. It also follows that for n ∈ N, \Gamma\left (\frac{1}{2}-n\right ) = \left (-\frac{1}{2}-n\right )! = \Pi\left (-\frac{1}{2}-n\right ) = \sqrt{\pi} \prod_{k=1}^n {2 \over 1 - 2k} = {(-4)^n n! \over (2n)!} \sqrt{\pi}. For example, \Gamma(-2.5) = (-3.5)! = \Pi(-3.5) = {2\over -1}\cdot{2\over -3}\cdot{2\over -5} \sqrt{\pi} = {(-4)^3 3! \over 6!} \sqrt{\pi} = -{8 \over 15} \sqrt{\pi} \approx -0.9453. The Pi function is certainly not the only way to extend factorials to a function defined at almost all complex values, and not even the only one that is analytic wherever it is defined. Nonetheless it is usually considered the most natural way to extend the values of the factorials to a complex function.  For instance, the Bohr–Mollerup theorem states that the Gamma function is the only function that takes the value 1 at 1, satisfies the functional equation Γ(n + 1) = nΓ(n), is meromorphic on the complex numbers, and is log-convex on the positive real axis.  A similar statement holds for the Pi function as well, using the Π(n) = nΠ(n − 1) functional equation.However, there exist complex functions that are probably simpler in the sense of analytic function theory and which interpolate the factorial values.  For example, Hadamard's 'Gamma'-function   which, unlike the Gamma function, is an entire function. Euler also developed a convergent product approximation for the non-integer factorials, which can be seen to be equivalent to the formula for the Gamma function above: \begin{align}n! = \Pi(n) &= \prod_{k = 1}^\infty \left(\frac{k+1}{k}\right)^n\!\!\frac{k}{n+k} \\ &= \left[ \left(\frac{2}{1}\right)^n\frac{1}{n+1}\right]\left[ \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^n\frac{2}{n+2}\right]\left[ \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^n\frac{3}{n+3}\right]\cdots. \end{align} However, this formula does not provide a practical means of computing the Pi or Gamma function, as its rate of convergence is slow.Applications of the Gamma functionThe volume of an n-dimensional hypersphere of radius R is V_n=\frac{\pi^{n/2}}{\Gamma((n/2)+1)}R^n. Factorial at the complex planeRepresentation through the Gamma-function allows evaluation of factorial of complex argument. Equilines of amplitude and phase of factorial are shown in figure. Let  \ f=\rho \exp({\rm i}\varphi)=(x+{\rm i}y)!=\Gamma(x+{\rm i}y+1)  . Several levels of constant modulus (amplitude)  \rho =\rm const  and constant phase  \varphi=\rm const  are shown. The grid covers range ~-3 \le x \le 3~ , ~-2 \le y \le 2~ with unit step. The scratched line shows the level  \varphi=\pm \pi .Thin lines show intermediate levels of constant modulus and constant phase. At poles   x+ {\rm i}y \in \rm (negative ~ integers) , phase and amplitude are not defined. Equilines are dense in vicinity of singularities along negative integer values of the argument.For  |z| , the Taylor expansions can be used: z!=\sum_{n=0}^\infty g_n z^n. The first coefficients of this expansion are n   g_n  approximation 0  11  1  -\gamma   - 0.5772156649  2  \frac{\pi^2}{12}+\frac{\gamma^2}{2}0.9890559955  3  -\frac{\zeta(3)}{3}-\frac{\pi^2\gamma}{12}-\frac{\gamma^3}{6}   -0.9074790760  where  \gamma  is the Euler constant and  \zeta  is the Riemann zeta function. Computer algebra systems such as SageMath can generate many terms of this expansion.Approximations of factorialFor the large values of the argument,factorial can be approximated through the integral of thedigamma function, using the continued fraction representation.This approach is due to T. J. Stieltjes (1894). Writing z! = exp(P(z)) where P(z) is  P(z) = p(z) + \log(2\pi)/2 - z + \left(z+\frac{1}{2}\right)\log(z), Stieltjes gave a continued fraction for p(z) p(z)=\cfrac{a_0}{z+\cfrac{a_1}{z+\cfrac{a_2}{z+\cfrac{a_3}{z+\ddots}}}} The first few coefficients a n  are Digital Library of Mathematical Functions,   n a n  0 1 / 12 1 1 / 30 2 53 / 210 3 195 / 371 4 22999 / 22737 5 29944523 / 19733142 6 109535241009 / 48264275462 There is a misconception that  \displaystyle\log(z!)=P(z)  or  \log(\Gamma(z\!+\!1))=P(z) for any complex z ≠ 0.  Indeed, the relation through the logarithm is valid only for specific range of values of z in vicinity of the real axis, while  |\Im(\Gamma(z\!+\!1))|  . The larger is the real part of the argument, the smaller should be the imaginary part.  However, the inverse relation, z! = exp(P(z)), is valid for the whole complex plane apart from zero. The convergence is poor in vicinity of the negative part of the real axis.  (It is difficult to have good convergence of any approximation in vicinity of the singularities).  While  |\Im(z)| >2   or  \Re(z)>2 , the 6 coefficients above are sufficient for the evaluation of the factorial with the complex  precision. For higher precision more coefficients can be computed by a rational QD-scheme (H. Rutishauser's QD algorithm). Non-extendability to negative integersThe relation n! = n × (n − 1)! allows one to compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a smaller integer.  The relation can be inverted so that one can compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a larger integer: (n-1)! = \frac{n!}{n} . Note, however, that this recursion does not permit us to compute the factorial of a negative integer; use of the formula to compute (−1) !  would require a division by zero, and thus blocks us from computing a factorial value for every negative integer.  (Similarly, the Gamma function is not defined for non-positive integers, though it is defined for all other complex numbers.)Factorial-like products and functionsThere are several other integer sequences similar to the factorial that are used in mathematics:Double factorial The product of all the odd integers up to some odd positive integer n is called the double factorial of n, and denoted by n !! .  .  That is, (2k-1)!! = \prod_{i=1}^k (2i-1) = \frac{(2k)!}{2^k k!} = \frac {_{2k}P_k} {2^k} = \frac   {2^k}. For example, 9!! = 1 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 9 = 945.The sequence of double factorials for n = 1, 3, 5, 7, ...  starts as1, 3, 15, 105, 945, 10395, 135135, ....  Double factorial notation may be used to simplify the expression of certain trigonometric integrals,  to provide an expression for the values of the Gamma function at half-integer arguments and the volume of hyperspheres,  and to solve many counting problems in combinatorics including counting binary trees with labeled leaves and perfect matchings in complete graphs.  Multifactorials A common related notation is to use multiple exclamation points to denote a multifactorial, the product of integers in steps of two ( n!! ), three ( n!!! ), or more (see generalizations of the double factorial). The double factorial is the most commonly used variant, but one can similarly define the triple factorial ( n!!! ) and so on.   One can define the k-th factorial, denoted by  n!^{(k)} , recursively for positive integers as  n!^{(k)} = \begin{cases}n & \text{if } 0   k\end{cases} though see the alternative definition below.In addition, similarly to  , one can define:  n!^{(k)} = 1 \ \text{if } -k  For sufficiently large  n \geq 1 , the ordinary single factorial function is expanded through the multifactorial functions as follows: \begin{align}n! & = n!! \cdot (n-1)!!,\ n \geq 1 \\   & = n!!! \cdot (n-1)!!! \cdot (n-2)!!!,\ n \geq 2 \\   & = \prod_{i=0}^{k-1} (n-i)!^{(k)},\ \text{ for } k \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}, n \geq k-1. \end{align} Some mathematicians have suggested an alternative notation of  n!_2  for the double factorial and similarly  n!_k  for other multifactorials, but this has not come into general use. Another common notation is to place the  k  parameter as a subscript as  n!_{(k)}  to denote the multifactorials defined above.In the same way that  n!  is not defined for negative integers, and  n!!  is not defined for negative even integers,  n!^{(k)}  is not defined for negative integers divisible by  k .PrimorialThe primorial   is similar to the factorial, but with the product taken only over the prime numbers.Superfactorial  Neil Sloane and Simon Plouffe defined a superfactorial in The Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (Academic Press, 1995) to be the product of the first  n  factorials.  So the superfactorial of 4 is  \operatorname{sf}(4)=1! \times 2! \times 3! \times 4!=288.  In general  \operatorname{sf}(n) =\prod_{k=1}^n k! =\prod_{k=1}^n k^{n-k+1} =1^n\cdot2^{n-1}\cdot3^{n-2}\cdots(n-1)^2\cdot n^1. Equivalently, the superfactorial is given by the formula  \operatorname{sf}(n) =\prod_{0 \le i  which is the determinant of a Vandermonde matrix.The sequence of superfactorials starts (from  n = 0 ) as1, 1, 2, 12, 288, 34560, 24883200, 125411328000, ...  Alternative definition Clifford Pickover in his 1995 book Keys to Infinity used a new notation, n$, to define the superfactorial n\$\equiv \begin{matrix} \underbrace{ n!^ }}}} \\ n! \end{matrix},  or as, n\$=n! [4] n!  where the [4] notation denotes the hyper4 operator, or using Knuth's up-arrow notation, n\$=(n!)\uparrow\uparrow(n!).  This sequence of superfactorials starts: 1\$=1   2\$=2^2=4   3\$=6 [4] 6={^6}6=6^{6^{6^{6^{6^6}}}}. Here, as is usual for compound exponentiation, the grouping is understood to be from right to left: a^{b^c}=a^{(b^c)}. HyperfactorialOccasionally the hyperfactorial of n is considered. It is written as H(n) and defined by  H(n) =\prod_{k=1}^n k^k =1^1\cdot2^2\cdot3^3\cdots(n-1)^{n-1}\cdot n^n. For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... the values H(n) are 1, 4, 108, 27648,...  .The asymptotic growth rate is H(n) \sim A n^{(6n^2 + 6n + 1)/12} e^{-n^2/4} where A = 1.2824... is the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant.  H(14) = 1.8474...×10 99  is already almost equal to a googol, and H(15) = 8.0896...×10 116  is almost of the same magnitude as the Shannon number, the theoretical number of possible chess games. Compared to the Pickover definition of the superfactorial, the hyperfactorial grows relatively slowly.The hyperfactorial function can be generalized to complex numbers in a similar way as the factorial function. The resulting function is called the K-function.See also Alternating factorialBhargava factorialDigamma functionExponential factorialFactorial number systemFactorial primeFactorionList of factorial and binomial topicsPochhammer symbol, which gives the falling or rising factorialSubfactorialTrailing zeros of factorialTriangular number, the additive analogue of factorial Notes References  External links

Cinema of Germany<====>10612<====>Cinema of Germany The Cinema of Germany refers to the film industry based in Germany and can be traced back to the late 19th century.  German cinema has made major technical and artistic contributions to film during the period from 1918-1933. Germany witnessed major changes to its identity during the 20th and 21st century.  Those changes determined the periodisation of national cinema into a succession of distinct eras and movements.    1895–1918 German Empire  The history of cinema in Germany can be traced back to the years shortly after the medium's birth.  On November 1, 1895 Max Skladanowsky and his brother Emil demonstrated their self-invented film projector the Bioscop at the Wintergarten music hall in Berlin. 

Frivolous litigation<====>10616<====>Frivolous litigation  In law, frivolous litigation is the practice of starting or carrying on lawsuits that, due to their lack of legal merit, have little to no chance of being won.  The term does not include cases that may be lost due to other matters not related to legal merit.  While colloquially, a person may term a lawsuit to be frivolous if he or she personally finds a claim to be absurd, in legal usage "frivolous litigation" consists of a claim or defense that is presented where the party (or the party's legal counsel) had reason to know that the claim or defense was manifestly insufficient or futile. 

Fiddle<====>10618<====>Fiddle    A fiddle is a bowed string musical instrument, most often a violin.   It is also a colloquial term for the violin, used by players in all genres including classical music.  Fiddle playing, or fiddling, refers to various styles of music.  The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles of music which are aural traditions, taught 'by ear' rather than via written music.There are few real distinctions between violins and fiddles, though more primitively constructed and smaller violins are more likely to be considered fiddles.  Due to the style of the music played, fiddles may optionally be set up with a bridge with a flatter arch to reduce the range of right-arm motion needed for techniques such as the double shuffle, a form of bariolage involving rapid alternation between pairs of adjacent strings.

Flugelhorn<====>10622<====>Flugelhorn  The flugelhorn ( —also spelled fluegelhorn, flugel horn, or Flügelhorn—from German, wing horn, or flank horn  ) is a brass instrument pitched in B , and resembles a trumpet, but has a wider, conical bore.  The instrument known today as the flugelhorn is a descendant of the valved bugle,  which had been developed from a valveless hunting horn known in eighteenth-century Germany as a Flügelhorn.    The valved bugle provided Adolphe Sax (creator of the saxophone family) with the inspiration for his B  soprano (contralto) saxhorns, on which the modern-day flugelhorn is modeled. 

Folk music<====>10623<====>Folk music   Folk music includes both traditional music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th century folk revival.  The term originated in the 19th century, but is often applied to music older than that.  Some types of folk music are also called world music.  Traditional folk music has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, or music performed by custom over a long period of time.  It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. Starting in the mid-20th century, a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music. 

Fullerene<====>10628<====>Fullerene   A fullerene is a molecule of carbon in the form of a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, tube, and many other shapes.  Spherical fullerenes, also referred to as Buckminsterfullerenes or buckyballs, resemble the balls used in association football.  Cylindrical fullerenes are also called carbon nanotubes (buckytubes).  Fullerenes are similar in structure to graphite, which is composed of stacked graphene sheets of linked hexagonal rings.  Unless they are cylindrical, they must also contain pentagonal (or sometimes heptagonal) rings.  "Fullerene", Encyclopædia Britannica on-line The first fullerene molecule to be discovered, and the family's namesake, buckminsterfullerene (C 60 ), was manufactured in 1985 by Richard Smalley, Robert Curl, James Heath, Sean O'Brien, and Harold Kroto at Rice University.

Fallacies of definition<====>10632<====>Fallacies of definitionFallacies of definition are the various ways in which definitions can fail to explain terms.  The phrase is used to suggest an analogy with an informal fallacy.   "Definitions that fail to have merit because they are overly broad, use obscure or ambiguous language, or contain circular reasoning are called fallacies of definition. "  Three major fallacies are overly broad, overly narrow, and mutually exclusive definitions, Potter, Karl H.  (1991).  Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, p. 87.  Motilal Banarsidass.   .  "Under-extension", "over-extension", and "mutual exclusion".   a fourth is incomprehensible definitions,  and one of the most common  is circular definitions.

Free software<====>10635<====>Free software   Free software or libre softwareis computer software distributed under terms that allow users to run the software for any purpose as well as to study, change, and distribute it and any adapted versions.   Philosophy of the GNU Project (gnu. org)  What is free software (fsf. org)    Free software is a matter of liberty, not price: users —individually or in cooperation with computer programmers— are free to do what they want with their copies of a free software (including profiting from them) regardless of how much is paid to obtain the program. 

Free software movement<====>10638<====>Free software movement The free software movement (FSM) or free / open source software movement (FOSSM) or free / libre open source software (FLOSS) is a social movement  with the goal of obtaining and guaranteeing certain freedoms for software users, namely the freedom to run the software, to study and change the software, and to redistribute copies with or without changes.  Although drawing on traditions and philosophies among members of the 1970s hacker culture and academia, Richard Stallman formally founded the movement in 1983 by launching the GNU Project.   Stallman later established the Free Software Foundation in 1985 to support the movement. 

Food<====>10646<====>Food   Food is any substance  consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism.  It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals.  The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Historically, humans secured food through two methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture.  Today, the majority of the food energy required by the ever increasing population of the world is supplied by the food industry. Food safety and food security are monitored by agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council.

Fantasy sport<====>10653<====>Fantasy sport A fantasy sport (also known less commonly as rotisserie or roto) is a type of online game where participants assemble imaginary or virtual teams of real players of a professional sport.   These teams compete based on the statistical performance of those players' players in actual games.   This performance is converted into points that are compiled and totaled according to a roster selected by each fantasy team's manager.   These point systems can be simple enough to be manually calculated by a "league commissioner" who coordinates and manages the overall league, or points can be compiled and calculated using computers tracking actual results of the professional sport. 

Forward pass<====>10654<====>Forward pass In several forms of football a forward pass is a throwing of the ball in the direction that the offensive team is trying to move, towards the defensive team's goal line.  The forward pass is one of the main distinguishers between gridiron football (American football and Canadian football) in which the play is legal and widespread, and rugby football (union and league) from which the North American games evolved, in which the play is illegal. In some football codes, such as association football (soccer), the kicked forward pass is used so ubiquitously that it is not thought of as a distinct kind of play at all.

Republic of Fiji Military Forces<====>10662<====>Republic of Fiji Military Forces   The Republic of Fiji Military Forces (RFMF) is the military force of the Pacific island nation of Fiji.  With a total manpower of 3,500 active soldiers and 6,000 reservists, it is one of the smallest militaries in the world.  However, most of its surrounding island nations have no militaries at all.  The Ground Force is organised into six infantry and one engineer battalions, with approximately 6,000 reserves.  There was formerly one "Zulu" company of counter-revolutionary specialists, which was deactivated in late 2000 due to a mutiny by some of its members. 

Foreign relations of Fiji<====>10663<====>Foreign relations of Fiji  Fiji has experienced many coups recently, in 1987, 2000, and 2006.  Fiji has been suspended various times from the Commonwealth of Nations, a grouping of mostly former British colonies.   It was readmitted to the Commonwealth in December 2001, following the parliamentary election held to restore democracy in September that year, and is currently suspended again because of the 2006 coup.   Other Pacific Island governments have generally been sympathetic to Fiji's internal political problems and have declined to take public positions. Fiji became the 127th member of the United Nations on 13 October 1970, and participates actively in the organization. 

Goal line (gridiron football)<====>10664<====>Goal line (gridiron football)The goal line is the chalked or painted line dividing the end zone from the field of play in American football and Canadian football.  It is the line that must be crossed in order to score a touchdown.  If any part of the ball reaches any part of the imaginary vertical plane transected by this line while in-bounds and in possession of a player whose team is striving toward that end of the field, this is considered a touchdown and scores six points for the team whose player has advanced the ball to, or recovered the ball in, this position. 

Tackle (football move)<====>10667<====>Tackle (football move)  Most forms of football have a move known as a tackle.  The primary and important purposes of tackling are to dispossess an opponent of the ball, to stop the player from gaining ground towards goal or to stop them from carrying out what they intend. The word is used in some contact variations of football to describe the act of physically holding or wrestling a player to the ground.  In others, it simply describes one or more methods of contesting for possession of the ball.  It can therefore be used as both a defensive or attacking move. 

Play from scrimmage<====>10668<====>Play from scrimmageA play from scrimmage is the activity of the games of Canadian football and American football during which one team tries to advance the ball, get a first down, or to score, and the other team tries to stop them or take the ball away.   Once a play is over, and before the next play starts, the football is considered dead.   A game of American football (or Canadian Football) consists of many (about 120-150) such plays. SpecificationsThe term is also used to denote a specific plan of action, or its execution, under a particular set of circumstances faced by either team. 

Football player<====>10669<====>Football player   A football player is a sportsperson who plays one of the different types of football.  The main types of football are association football, American football, Canadian football, Australian rules football, Gaelic football, rugby league and rugby union. It has been estimated that there are 250 million association football players in the world,  and many play the other forms of football. CareerJean-Pierre Papin has described football as a "universal language".   Footballers across the world and at almost any level may regularly attract large crowds of spectators, and players are the focal points of widespread social phenomena such as association football culture.

Frank Zappa<====>10672<====>Frank Zappa  Frank Vincent Zappa  (December 21, 1940 – December 4, 1993) was an American musician, composer, activist and filmmaker.  His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture.   In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and musique concrète works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band  the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist.   Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers.  He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse rock musicians of his era. 

Fagales<====>10673<====>Fagales The Fagales are an order of flowering plants, including some of the best-known trees.  The order name is derived from genus Fagus, beeches.  They belong among the rosid group of dicotyledons. The families and genera currently included are as follows:Betulaceae - birch family (Alnus, Betula, Carpinus, Corylus, Ostrya, Ostryopsis)Casuarinaceae - she-oak family (Allocasuarina, Casuarina, Ceuthostoma, Gymnostoma)Fagaceae - beech family (Castanea, Castanopsis, Chrysolepis, Colombobalanus, Fagus, Lithocarpus, Notholithocarpus, Quercus)Juglandaceae - walnut family (Alfaroa, Carya, Cyclocarya, Engelhardia, Juglans, Oreomunnea,  Platycarya, Pterocarya, Rhoiptelea)Myricaceae - bayberry family (Canacomyrica, Comptonia, Myrica)Nothofagaceae - southern beech family (Fuscospora,  Lophozonia, Nothofagus, Trisyngyne)Ticodendraceae - ticodendron family (Ticodendron)The older Cronquist system only included four families (Betulaceae, Corylaceae, Fagaceae, Ticodendraceae; Corylaceae now being included within Betulaceae); this arrangement is followed by, for example, the World checklist of selected plant families (see external link below). The other families were split into three different orders, placed among the Hamamelidae.  The Casuarinales comprised the single family Casuarinaceae, the Juglandales comprised the Juglandaceae and Rhoipteleaceae, and the Myricales comprised the remaining forms (plus Balanops).  The change is due to studies suggesting the Myricales, so defined, are paraphyletic to the other two groups.SystematicsModern molecular phylogenetics suggest the following relationships:  References External linksMissouri Botanical Gardens - FagalesWCSP: World checklist of selected plant families

Fabales<====>10674<====>Fabales The Fabales are an order of flowering plants included in the rosid group of the eudicots in the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group II classification system.

Five-card draw<====>10679<====>Five-card draw  Five-card draw (also known as a Cantrell draw) is a poker variant that is considered the simplest variant of poker, and is the basis for video poker.   As a result, it is often the first variant learned by new players.  It is commonly played in home games but rarely played in casino and tournament play.   The variant is also offered by some online venues, although it is not as popular as other variants such as Seven-card stud and Texas hold 'em. GameplayIn casino play the first betting round begins with the player to the left of the big blind, and subsequent rounds begin with the player to the dealer's left. 

Flaming (Internet)<====>10680<====>Flaming (Internet) Flaming  is a hostile and insulting interaction between persons over the internet, often involving the use of profanity. It can also be the swapping of insults back and forth or with many people teaming up on a single victim.  Flaming usually occurs in the social context of an Internet forum, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Usenet, by e-mail, game servers such as Xbox Live or PlayStation Network, social media services, and on video-sharing websites such as YouTube.  It is frequently the result of the discussion of heated real-world issues such as politics, religion, and philosophy, or of issues that polarize sub-populations, but can also be provoked by seemingly trivial differences. 

Frank Lloyd Wright<====>10683<====>Frank Lloyd Wright  Frank Lloyd Wright (born Frank Lincoln Wright, June 8, 1867 – April 9, 1959) was an American architect, interior designer, writer and educator, who designed more than 1,000 structures, 532 of which were completed.  Wright believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture.  This philosophy was best exemplified by Fallingwater (1935), which has been called "the best all-time work of American architecture".   His creative period spanned more than 70 years. Wright was the pioneer of what came to be called the Prairie School movement of architecture and he also developed the concept of the Usonian home in Broadacre City, his unique vision for urban planning in the United States. 

Filk music<====>10685<====>Filk music  Filk music is a musical culture, genre, and community tied to science fiction/fantasy/horror fandom and a type of fan labor.  The genre has been active since the early 1950s, and played primarily since the mid-1970s. Etymology and definitionsThe term "filk" (originally a typographical error) predates 1955.(See also below. )DefinitionsIt is used as a noun, referring either to the genre (thus equivalent to "filk music") or to a filk song.   It can also be used to refer to a gathering with the primary purpose of singing filk songs.  Such a gathering held in someone's home is called a housefilk. 

Frisbee<====>10687<====>Frisbee A frisbee (also called a flying disc or simply a disc) is a gliding toy or sporting item that is generally plastic and roughly   in diameter with a lip,  used recreationally and competitively for throwing and catching, for example, in flying disc games.  The shape of the disc, an airfoil in cross-section, allows it to fly by generating lift as it moves through the air while spinning. Flying discs are thrown and caught for free-form (freestyle) recreation and as part of many flying disc games.  A wide range of flying disc variants are available commercially. 

History of the Falkland Islands<====>10689<====>History of the Falkland Islands  The history of the Falkland Islands ( ) goes back at least five hundred years, with active exploration and colonisation only taking place in the 18th century.  Nonetheless, the islands have been a matter of controversy, as they have been claimed by the French, British, Spaniards and Argentines at various points. The islands were uninhabited when discovered by Europeans.  France established a colony on the islands in 1764.  In 1765, a British captain claimed the islands for Britain.  In early 1770 a Spanish commander arrived from Argentina with five ships and 1400 soldiers forcing the British to leave Port Egmont. 

Geography of the Falkland Islands<====>10690<====>Geography of the Falkland Islands The Falkland Islands are located in the South Atlantic Ocean between 51°S and 53°S on a projection of the Patagonian Shelf, part of the South American continental shelf.  In ancient geological time this shelf was part of Gondwana, and around 400 million years ago split from what is now Africa and drifted westwards from it.  Today the islands are subjected to the Roaring Forties, winds that shape both their geography and climate. The Falklands comprise two main islands, West Falkland and East Falkland, and about 776 small islands.    Geology The geological history of the Falkland Islands began during the Precambrian era more than 1000 million years ago, when Proterozoic granites and gneisses were laid down in Gondwana. 

Politics of the Falkland Islands<====>10692<====>Politics of the Falkland Islands  The politics of the Falkland Islands takes place in a framework of a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary representative democratic dependency as set out by the constitution, whereby the Governor exercises the duties of head of state in the absence of the monarch and the Chief Executive acts as the head of government, with an elected Legislative Assembly to propose new laws and hold the executive to account. The islands, an archipelago in the southern Atlantic Ocean, are a self-governing British overseas territory.  Executive power is exercised on behalf of the Queen by an appointed Governor, who primarily acts on the advice of the Executive Council. 

Economy of the Falkland Islands<====>10693<====>Economy of the Falkland Islands  The economy of the Falkland Islands, which first involved sealing, whaling and provisioning ships, became heavily dependent on sheep farming from the 1870s to 1980.  It then diversified and now has income from tourism, commercial fishing, and servicing the fishing industry as well as agriculture.  The islands use the Falkland pound, which is backed by sterling. Historical developmentDuring the 19th century, the supply and maintenance depot for ships at Stanley developed into a port serving ships rounding Cape Horn.  There was also trade in cow hides from the wild descendants of cattle introduced by French settlers in the late 18th century. 

Telecommunications in the Falkland Islands<====>10694<====>Telecommunications in the Falkland IslandsTelecommunications in the Falkland Islands  includes radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet. Radio and television Radio: Radio services provided by the public broadcaster, Falkland Islands Radio Service, broadcasting on both AM and FM frequencies, and by the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) (2007).

The Falkland Islands Radio Service (FIRS) operates a radio network in conjunction with the BBC World Service, while the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) operates three networks of its own. 

Transport in the Falkland Islands<====>10695<====>Transport in the Falkland Islands  The Falkland Islands currently has three primary means of transport - road, sea and air.  However, in 1946, when Sir Miles Clifford arrived as governor, there were no air services, no roads outside Stanley and an indifferent sea service.  Sir Miles was instrumental in starting the Falkland Islands Government Air Service in December 1948.  The inaugural flight involved a mercy flight from North Arm Settlement to Stanley to bring a girl with peritonitis to life-saving medical help in Stanley.There are now an international airport, a domestic airport, a number of airstrips, a growing road network and a much-improved ferry service between the two main islands. 

Military of the Falkland Islands<====>10696<====>Military of the Falkland Islands   The Falkland Islands are a British overseas territory and, as such, rely on the UK for the guarantee of their security.  The other UK territories in the South Atlantic, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, fall under the protection of the British forces on the Falklands (also known as British Forces Falkland Islands or British Forces South Atlantic Islands), which includes commitments from the British Army, Royal Air Force and Royal Navy.   They are headed by the Commander of the British Forces South Atlantic Islands (CBFSAI).  The maintenance of only a token military force before the Falklands War, and the suggestion that HMS Endurance was to be withdrawn, persuaded Argentina to start that conflict, assuming that Britain would not respond or be easily able to recapture the islands. 

History of the Faroe Islands<====>10698<====>History of the Faroe IslandsThe early details of the history of the Faroe Islands are  unclear.  It is possible that Brendan, an Irish monk, sailed past the islands during his North Atlantic voyage in the 6th century.  He saw an 'Island of Sheep' and a 'Paradise of Birds,' which some say could be the Faroes with its dense bird population and sheep.  This does suggest however that other sailors had got there before him, to bring the sheep.  Norsemen settled the Faroe Islands in the 9th century or 10th century.  The islands were officially converted to Christianity around the year 1000, and became a part of the Kingdom of Norway in 1035. 

Geography of the Faroe Islands<====>10699<====>Geography of the Faroe IslandsThe Faroe Islands are an island group consisting of eighteen islands between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic, about half-way between Iceland and Norway.  Its coordinates are  .  It is 1,393 square kilometres in area, and includes small lakes and rivers, but no major ones.  There are 1,117 kilometres of coastline, and no land boundaries with any other country. The Faroe Islands generally have cool summers and mild winters, with a usually overcast sky and frequent fog and strong winds.  Although at a high latitude, due to the Gulf Stream their climate is ameliorated. 

Demographics of the Faroe Islands<====>10700<====>Demographics of the Faroe Islands This article is about the demographic features of the population of the Faroe Islands, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.  The vast majority of the population are ethnic Faroese, of North Germanic descent.  Ethnic Faroese are, in genetic terms, among the most homogenous groups ever found.  Recent DNA analysis have revealed that Y chromosomes, tracing male descent, are 87% Scandinavian.  The studies show that mitochondrial DNA, tracing female descent, is 84% Scottish / Irish.  Of the approximately 48,000 inhabitants of the Faroe Islands (16,921 private households (2004)), 98% are Danish realm citizens, meaning Faroese, Danish, or Greenlandic. 

Politics of the Faroe Islands<====>10701<====>Politics of the Faroe Islands The politics of the Faroe Islands a "constituent country" ( ) of the Kingdom of Denmark, function within the framework of a parliamentary representative democratic dependency, whereby the Prime Minister of the Faroe Islands is the head of government,  and of a  multi-party system.  The Faroe Islands are politically associated with the Kingdom of Denmark, but have been self-governing since 1948.  Executive power is exercised by the government.  Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Løgting.  The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature and the responsibility of Denmark. 

Economy of the Faroe Islands<====>10702<====>Economy of the Faroe Islands The economy of the Faroe Islands was the 166th largest in the world in 2014, having a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of $2. 613 billion per annum.    High dependence on fishing means the economy remains extremely vulnerable.  The Faroese hope to broaden their economic base by building new fish-processing plants.   Petroleum found close to the Faroese area gives hope for deposits in the immediate area, which may lay the basis to sustained economic prosperity.   Also important are the annual subsidy from Denmark, which amounts to about 3% of the GDP.

Transport in the Faroe Islands<====>10704<====>Transport in the Faroe Islands  The Faroe Islands is served by an internal transport system based on roads, ferries, and helicopters.  As of the 70s, the majority of the population centres of the Faroe Islands have been joined to a single road network, connected by bridges and tunnels. International transport, both for passengers and freight, remains difficult due to high costs, long distances, and bad weather, especially during the winter.  Exporting domestically produced goods is thus expensive; this limits the development of a commodity-based economy. HistoryThe general history of the Faroese transportation system can be divided into four periods:Before 1900During this first period, transportation was rather primitive; it consisted of row boats, walking, and, in certain places, horse transport (for the upper class).

Geography of Finland<====>10709<====>Geography of Finland The geography of Finland is characterized by its northern position, its ubiquitous landscapes of intermingled boreal forests and lakes and its low population density.  Finland can be divided into three areas: archipelagoes and coastal lowlands, a slightly higher central lake plateau and uplands to north and northeast.  Bordering the Baltic Sea, Gulf of Bothnia, and Gulf of Finland, as well as Sweden, Norway, and Russia, Finland is the northernmost country in the European Union.  Most of the population and agricultural resources are concentrated in the south.  Northern and eastern Finland are sparsely populated containing vast wilderness areas. 

Demographics of Finland<====>10710<====>Demographics of FinlandThis article is about the demographic features of the population of Finland, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population. Finland numbers some 5. 5 million people and has an average population density of 17 inhabitants per square kilometre.  There has not been any remarkable growth in the number of population since the inception of modern Finland.  This makes it the third most sparsely populated country in Europe, after Iceland and Norway.  Population distribution is very uneven: the population is concentrated on the small southwestern coastal plain. 

Politics of Finland<====>10711<====>Politics of Finland    The politics of Finland take place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic.

The motorway network totals   with additional   reserved only for motor traffic. Road network expenditure of around 1 billion euro is paid with vehicle and fuel taxes that amount to around 1. 

Finnish Defence Forces<====>10715<====>Finnish Defence Forces The Finnish Defence Forces ( ,  ) are responsible for the defence of Finland.  A universal male conscription is in place, under which all men above 18 years of age serve for 165, 255 or 347 days.  Alternative non-military service and volunteer service by women are possible. Finland is the only non-NATO EU country bordering Russia.  Finland's official policy states that a wartime military strength of 280,000 personnel constitutes a sufficient deterrent.  The army consists of a highly mobile field army backed up by local defence units.  The army defends the national territory and its military strategy employs the use of the heavily forested terrain and numerous lakes to wear down an aggressor, instead of attempting to hold the attacking army on the frontier. 

Foreign relations of Finland<====>10716<====>Foreign relations of Finland  The foreign relations of Finland are the responsibility of the President of Finland, who leads foreign policy in cooperation with the government.  Implicitly the government is responsible for internal policy and decision making in the European Union.

Prior to 1882, the coastal portions of French Guinea were part of the French colony of Senegal. In 1891, Rivières du Sud was placed under the colonial lieutenant governor at Dakar, who had authority over the French coastal regions east to Porto-Novo (modern Benin).  In 1894 Rivières du Sud, Cote d'Ivoire and Dahomey were separated into 'independent' colonies, with Rivières du Sud being renamed the Colony of French Guinea.

It was originally inhabited by a number of Native American peoples, among them the Kalina (Caribs), Arawak, Emerillon, Galibi, Palikur, Wayampi (also known as Oyampi), and Wayana.  The first Europeans arrived in the expeditions of Christopher Columbus, shortly before 1500. Beginnings of European involvementIn 1498 French Guiana was first visited by Europeans when Christopher Columbus sailed to the region on his third voyage and named it the "Land of pariahs".   In 1608 the Grand Duchy of Tuscany sent an expedition to the area in order to create an Italian colony for the commerce of Amazonian products to Renaissance Italy, but the sudden death of Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany stopped it.

Demographics of French Guiana<====>10763<====>Demographics of French Guiana  PopulationAccording to INSEE the population of French Guiana was 239,450 of January 1, 2012.   The population is very young: 44% are below the age of 20, while only 1. 7% are 75 years or older.  The age distribution is a reflection of the high fertility rates of French Guiana. NationalityOn January 1, 2010, 64. 5% of the population had French nationality, while 35. 5% had a foreign nationality.   Of these, Surinamese (13. 8% of the total population), Haitians (8. 8%) and Brazilians (8. 7) were the largest groups.  Smaller groups included people with nationality of Guyana (1. 

Politics of French Guiana<====>10764<====>Politics of French Guiana  French Guiana is not a separate territory but is both an overseas région and overseas department of France, with the same government institutions as areas on the French mainland.  The administrative center is Cayenne. The President of France appoints a prefect (resident at the prefecture building in Cayenne) as his representative to head the local government of French Guiana.  There are two local executive bodies: the 19‑member general council and the 34‑member regional council, both elected.  They will soon be reunited into a single council, since they have authority on exactly the same territory. 

Economy of French Guiana<====>10765<====>Economy of French Guiana The economy of French Guiana is tied closely to that of France through subsidies and imports.  Besides the French space center at Kourou, fishing and forestry are the most important economic activities.  The large reserves of tropical hardwoods, not fully exploited, support an expanding sawmill industry which provides sawn logs for export.  Cultivation of crops is limited to the coastal area, where the population is largely concentrated; rice and manioc are the major crops.  French Guiana is heavily dependent on imports of food and energy.  Unemployment is a serious problem, particularly among younger workers.

Transport in French Guiana<====>10767<====>Transport in French Guiana  There are four types of public transport in French Guiana. BusesAir linksThe long distance carriersThe taxi boats. The busThe bus of the Joint Association of Public Transport (SMTC) serve only the municipality of Cayenne.  There are seven lines.  Some lines have 3 or 4 buses.  The price of ticket, the normal rate is 1. 10 euro for 2011.  Note that the SMTC is a public body, and the lines are restricted.  SMTC buses now have a system of air conditioning.  The seats are more comfortable.  These buses are also used to transport students from different schools. 

François Truffaut<====>10770<====>François Truffaut François Roland Truffaut ( ; 6 February 1932 – 21 October 1984) was a French film director, screenwriter, producer, actor, and film critic, as well as one of the founders of the French New Wave.   In a film career lasting over a quarter of a century, he remains an icon of the French film industry, having worked on over 25 films.    Truffaut's film The 400 Blows came to be a defining film of the French New Wave movement.  Unique in world cinema, the movie is followed over 20 years with classics Stolen Kisses, Bed and Board and Love on the Run between 1958 and 1979. 

Fair use<====>10772<====>Fair use    Fair use is a doctrine in the law of the United States that permits limited use of copyrighted material without having to first acquire permission from the copyright holder.  Fair use is of the limitations to copyright intended to balance the interests of copyright holders with the public interest in the wider distribution and use of creative works by allowing certain limited uses that might otherwise be considered infringement.  Examples of fair use in United States copyright law include commentary, search engines, criticism, parody, news reporting, research, and scholarship.  Fair use provides for the legal, unlicensed citation or incorporation of copyrighted material in another author's work under a four-factor test. 

Flying car (aircraft)<====>10773<====>Flying car (aircraft) A flying car is a type of personal air vehicle that provides door-to-door transportation by both ground and air.  The term "flying car" is often used to include roadable aircraft and hovercars. Many prototypes have been built since the first years of the twentieth century, but no flying car has yet reached production status. Their appearance is often predicted by futurologists, with their failure ever to reach production leading to the catchphrase, "Where's my flying car?"Flying cars are also a popular theme in fantasy and science fiction stories. HistoryEarly developmentsIn 1926, Henry Ford displayed an experimental single-seat aeroplane that he called the "sky flivver". 

Film editing<====>10775<====>Film editing Film editing is a technical part of the post-production process of filmmaking.  The term is derived from the traditional process of working with film which increasingly involves the use of digital technology. The film editor works with the raw footage, selecting shots and combines them into sequences which create a finished motion picture.  Film editing is described as an art or skill, the only art that is unique to cinema, separating filmmaking from other art forms that preceded it, although there are close parallels to the editing process in other art forms such as poetry and novel writing. 

Friedrich Wöhler<====>10777<====>Friedrich Wöhler Friedrich Wöhler ( ; 31 July 1800 – 23 September 1882) was a German chemist, best known for his synthesis of urea, but also the first to isolate several chemical elements. BiographyHe was born in Eschersheim, which belonged toHanau at the time but is nowadays a district of Frankfurt am Main.  In 1823 Wöhler finished his study of medicine in Heidelberg at the laboratory of Leopold Gmelin, who arranged for him to work under Jöns Jakob Berzelius in Stockholm, Sweden.  He taught chemistry from 1826 to 1831 at the Polytechnic School in Berlin until 1839 when he was stationed at the Polytechnic School at Kassel. 

Funk<====>10778<====>Funk  Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid-1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B).  Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground.  Like much of African-inspired music, funk typically consists of a complex groove with rhythm instruments playing interlocking grooves.  Funk uses the same richly colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. 

Frequency<====>10779<====>Frequency    Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time.   It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency.  The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency.    For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its period—the time interval between beats—is half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats).   Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light. 

Film festival<====>10781<====>Film festival  A film festival is an organized, extended presentation of films in one or more cinemas or screening venues, usually in a single city or region.  Increasingly, film festivals show some films outdoors.   Films may be of recent date and, depending upon the festival's focus, can include international and domestic releases.  Some festivals focus on a specific film-maker or genre (e. g. , film noir) or subject matter (e. g. , horror film festivals).  A number of film festivals specialise in short films of a defined maximum length.  Film festivals are typically annual events. 

History of film<====>10783<====>History of film   Although the start of the history of film is not clearly defined, the commercial, public screening of ten of Lumière brothers' short films in Paris on 28 December 1895 can be regarded as the breakthrough of projected cinematographic motion pictures.  There had been earlier cinematographic results and screenings but these lacked either the quality or the momentum that propelled the cinématographe Lumière into a worldwide success.  Soon film production companies were established all over the world.  The first decade of motion picture saw film moving from a novelty to an established mass entertainment industry. 

Cinema of France<====>10784<====>Cinema of France  Cinema of France refers to the film industry based in France.  The French cinema comprises the art of film and creative movies made within the nation of France or by French filmmakers abroad. France is the birthplace of cinema and was responsible for many of its significant contributions to the art form and the film-making process itself.Several important cinematic movements, including the Nouvelle Vague, began in the country.  It is noted for having a particularly strong film industry, due in part to protections afforded by the French government.  Apart from its strong and innovative film tradition, France has also been a gathering spot for artists from across Europe and the world. 

Cinema of the Soviet Union<====>10786<====>Cinema of the Soviet Union  The cinema of the Soviet Union, not to be confused with "cinema of Russia" despite films in the Russian language being predominant in the body of work so described, includes films produced by the constituent republics of the Soviet Union reflecting elements of their pre-Soviet culture, language and history, albeit they were all regulated by the central government in Moscow.  Most prolific in their republican films, after the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, were Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine, and, to a lesser degree, Lithuania, Belarus and Moldavia.   At the same time, the nation's film industry, which was fully nationalized throughout most of the country's history, was guided by philosophies and laws propounded by the monopoly Soviet Communist Party which introduced a new view on the cinema, socialist realism, which was different from the one before or after the existence of the Soviet Union. 

Cinema of Italy<====>10787<====>Cinema of Italy The Cinema of Italy comprises the films made within Italy or by Italian directors.   Since the development of the Italian film industry in the early 1900s, Italian filmmakers and performers have, at times, experienced both domestic and international success, and have influenced film movements throughout the world.   As of 2014, Italian films have won 14 Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, the most of any country, as well as 12 Palmes d'Or, the second-most of any country. Early Italian films were typically adaptations of books or stage plays.   By the 1910s, Italian filmmakers were utilizing complex set designs, lavish costumes, and record budgets, to produce pioneering films such as Enrico Guazzoni's Quo Vadis (1913) and Giovanni Pastrone's Cabiria (1914). 

Cinema of Poland<====>10789<====>Cinema of Poland The history of cinema in Poland is almost as long as history of cinematography, and it has universal achievements, even though Polish movies tend to be less commercially available than movies from several other European nations. After World War II, the communist government built an auteur based national cinema, trained hundreds of new directors and empowered them to make films.  Filmmakers like Roman Polanski, Krzysztof Kieślowski, Agnieszka Holland, Andrzej Wajda, Andrzej Żuławski, Andrzej Munk,  and Jerzy Skolimowski impacted the development of Polish filmmaking.   In more recent years, the industry has been producer-led with finance being the key to a film being made, and with a large number of independent filmmakers of all genres, Polish productions tend to be more inspired by American film. 

Cinema of Japan<====>10790<====>Cinema of Japan  The   has a history that spans more than 100 years.  Japan has one of the oldest and largest film industries in the world; as of 2010, it was the fourth largest by number of feature films produced.   In 2011 Japan produced 411 feature films that earned 54. 9% of a box office total of US$2. 338 billion.   Movies have been produced in Japan since 1897, when the first foreign cameramen arrived.  In a Sight & Sound list of the best films produced in Asia, Japanese works made up eight of the top 12, with Tokyo Story (1953) ranked number one. 

Cinema of China<====>10791<====>Cinema of China The cinema of China is one of three distinct historical threads of Chinese-language cinema together with the cinema of Hong Kong and the cinema of Taiwan. Cinema was introduced in China in 1896 and the first Chinese film, The Battle of Dingjunshan, was made in 1905, with the film industry being centered on Shanghai in the first decades.  The first sound film, Sing-Song Girl Red Peony, using the sound-on-disc technology, was made in 1931.  The 1930s, considered the first "golden period" of Chinese cinema, saw the advent of the Leftist cinematic movement and the dispute between Nationalists and Communists was reflected in the films produced. 

Cinema of the United Kingdom<====>10793<====>Cinema of the United Kingdom  The United Kingdom has had a significant film industry for over a century.  While film production reached an all-time high in 1936,    the "golden age" of British cinema is usually thought to have occurred in the 1940s, during which the directors David Lean,  Michael Powell, (with Emeric Pressburger)  and Carol Reed  produced their most highly acclaimed work.  Many British actors have achieved international fame and critical success, including Maggie Smith, Michael Caine,  Sean Connery  and Kate Winslet.   Some of the films with the largest ever box office returns have been made in the United Kingdom, including the second and third highest-grossing film series (Harry Potter and James Bond). 

Feminist film theory<====>10796<====>Feminist film theoryFeminist film theory is a theoretical film criticism derived from feminist politics and feminist theory.  Feminists have many approaches to cinema analysis, regarding the film elements analyzed and their theoretical underpinnings. HistoryThe development of feminist film theory was influenced by second wave feminism and women's studies in the 1960s and 1970s.  Initially in the United States in the early 1970s feminist film theory was generally based on sociological theory and focused on the function of female characters in film narratives or genres.  Feminist film theory, such as Marjorie Rosen’s Popcorn Venus: Women, Movies, and the American Dream (1973) and Molly Haskell’s From Reverence to Rape: The Treatment of Women in Movies (1974) analyze the ways in which women are portrayed in film, and how this relates to a broader historical context. 

Formalist film theory<====>10798<====>Formalist film theory  Formalist film theory is a theory of film study that is focused on the formal, or technical, elements of a film: i. e. , the lighting, scoring, sound and set design, use of color, shot composition, and editing.  It is a major theory of film study today. OverviewFormalism, at its most general, considers the synthesis (or lack of synthesis) of the multiple elements of film production, and the effects, emotional and intellectual, of that synthesis and of the individual elements.   For example, take the single element of editing.  A formalist might study how standard Hollywood "continuity editing" creates a more comforting effect and non-continuity or jump cut editing might become more disconcerting or volatile. 

Film theory<====>10799<====>Film theory Film theory is a set of scholarly approaches   within the academic discipline of cinema studies that questions the essentialism of cinema and provides conceptual frameworks for understanding film's relationship to reality, the other arts, individual viewers, and society at large.  Film theory is not to be confused with general film criticism, or film history, though these three disciplines interrelate. Although film theory originated from linguistics and literary theory   it also overlaps with the philosophy of film.  HistoryFrench philosopher Henri Bergson's Matter and Memory (1896) has been cited as anticipating the development of film theory during the birth of cinema. 

Film noir<====>10802<====>Film noir  Film noir ( ;  ) is a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas, particularly such that emphasize cynical attitudes and sexual motivations.  Hollywood's classical film noir period is generally regarded as extending from the early 1940s to the late 1950s.  Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key, black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography.  Many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Great Depression. 

Finno-Ugric languages<====>10803<====>Finno-Ugric languages  Finno-Ugric (  or  ),  Finno-Ugrian or Fenno-Ugric is a traditional grouping of all languages in the Uralic language family except the Samoyedic languages.  Its commonly accepted status as a subfamily of Uralic is based on criteria formulated in the 19th century and is   criticized by some contemporary linguists.   The three most-spoken Uralic languages, Hungarian, Finnish, and Estonian, are all included in Finno-Ugric, although linguistic roots common to both branches of the traditional Finno-Ugric language tree (Finno-Permic and Ugric) are distant. The term Finno-Ugric, which originally referred to the entire family, is sometimes used as a synonym for the term Uralic, which includes the Samoyedic languages,  as commonly happens when a language family is expanded with further discoveries. 

Freestyle music<====>10808<====>Freestyle music  Freestyle is a form of electronic dance music that emerged in the United States in the 1980s.  It experienced its greatest popularity from the late 1980s until the early 1990s.  It continues to be produced today and enjoys some degree of popularity, especially in urban settings.  A common theme of freestyle lyricism is heartbreak in the city.    Notable performers in the freestyle genre include Stevie B, Corina, Lil Suzy, Timmy T, George Lamond, TKA, Noel, Company B, Exposé, Debbie Deb, Brenda K.  Starr, the Cover Girls, Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, Information Society, Pretty Poison, Sa-Fire, Shannon, Coro, Lisette Melendez, Judy Torres, Rockell, and many others. 

Fantasy (psychology)<====>10810<====>Fantasy (psychology) Fantasy in a psychological sense refers to two different possible aspects of the mind, the conscious, and the unconscious.   In the unconscious sense, it is sometimes spelled "phantasy". Conscious fantasyA fantasy is a situation imagined by an individual that expresses certain desires or aims on the part of its creator.  Fantasies sometimes involve situations that are highly unlikely; or they may be quite realistic.  Fantasies can also be sexual in nature.  Another, more basic meaning of fantasy is something which is not 'real,' as in perceived explicitly by any of the senses, but exists as an imagined situation of object to subject. 

Surnames by country<====>10814<====>Surnames by countrySurname conventions and laws vary around the world.  This article gives an overview of surnames around the world.  English-speaking countries  Ireland, Isle of Man, and Scotland   Spanish-speaking countries  ArgentinaIn Argentina, normally only one family name, the father's paternal family name, is used and registered, as in English-speaking countries.  However, it is possible to use both the paternal and maternal name.  For example, if Ana Laura Melachenko and Emanuel Darío Guerrero had a daughter named Adabel Anahí, her full name could be Adabel Anahí Guerrero Melachenko.  Women, however, do not change their family names upon marriage and continue to use their birth family names instead of their husband's family names. 

Franc<====>10815<====>Franc Franc   1 Swiss franc 1983   1 French franc 1991 Belgian franc Belgian franc 1 Belgian franc 1996   1 Luxembourg franc 1990   1 Monegasque franc 1978  100 Saar francs 1956 The franc (₣) is the name of several currency units.  The French franc was the currency of France until the euro was adopted in 1999 (by law, 2002 de facto).  The Swiss franc is a major world currency today due to the prominence of Swiss financial institutions.  The name is said to derive from the Latin inscription francorum rex (Style of the French sovereign: King of the Franks) used on  early French coins  and until the 18th century, or from the French franc, meaning "frank" (and "free" in certain contexts, such as coup franc, "free kick" ). 

Federal Reserve System<====>10819<====>Federal Reserve System   The Federal Reserve System (also known as the Federal Reserve or simply the Fed) is the central banking system of the United States.  It was created on December 23, 1913, with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act, after a series of financial panics (particularly the panic of 1907) led to the desire for central control of the monetary system in order to alleviate financial crises.   Over the years, events such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Great Recession during the 2000s have led to the expansion of the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System. 

Francium<====>10821<====>Francium   Francium is a chemical element with symbol Fr and atomic number 87.  It used to be known as eka-caesium and actinium K.   It is the second-least electronegative element, behind only caesium,  and is the second rarest naturally occurring element (after astatine).  Francium is a highly radioactive metal that decays into astatine, radium, and radon.  As an alkali metal, it has one valence electron. Bulk francium has never been viewed.  Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, it is assumed that francium would appear as a highly reactive metal, if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid. 

Fermium<====>10822<====>Fermium   Fermium is a synthetic element with symbol Fm and atomic number 100.  It is a member of the actinide series.  It is the heaviest element that can be formed by neutron bombardment of lighter elements, and hence the last element that can be prepared in macroscopic quantities, although pure fermium metal has not yet been prepared.   A total of 19 isotopes are known, with  257 Fm being the longest-lived with a half-life of 100. 5 days. It was discovered in the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Enrico Fermi, one of the pioneers of nuclear physics. 

Frédéric Chopin<====>10823<====>Frédéric ChopinFrédéric François Chopin ( ;  , (born Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin)  (1 March 1810 17 October 1849) was a Polish composer and virtuoso pianist of the Romantic era who wrote primarily for the solo piano.  He gained and has maintained renown worldwide as a leading musician of his era, whose "poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation. "  Chopin was born in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw and grew up in Warsaw, which in 1815 became part of Congress Poland.   A child prodigy, he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising. 

Free Democratic Party (Germany)<====>10825<====>Free Democratic Party (Germany)   The Free Democratic Party ( , FDP) is a liberal  and classical liberalpolitical party in Germany.  The FDP is led by Christian Lindner. The FDP was founded in 1948 by members of the former liberal political parties existing in Germany before World War II, the German Democratic Party and the German People's Party.   For most of the Federal Republic's history, it has held the balance of power in the Bundestag.   It was a junior coalition partner to either the CDU/CSU (1949–56, 1961–66, 1982–98, and 2009–13) or the Social Democratic Party of Germany (1969–82). 

Fax<====>10826<====>Fax Fax (short for facsimile),  sometimes called telecopying or telefax (the latter short for telefacsimile), is the telephonic transmission of scanned printed material (both text and images), normally to a telephone number connected to a printer or other output device.  The original document is scanned with a fax machine (or a telecopier), which processes the contents (text or images) as a single fixed graphic image, converting it into a bitmap, and then transmitting it through the telephone system in the form of audio-frequency tones.  The receiving fax machine interprets the tones and reconstructs the image, printing a paper copy. 

Film crew<====>10827<====>Film crew    A film crew is a group of people, hired by a production company, for the purpose of producing a film or motion picture.  The crew is distinguished from the cast as the cast are understood to be the actors who appear in front of the camera or provide voices for characters in the film.  The crew is also separate from the producers as the producers are the ones who own a portion of either the film company or the film's intellectual property rights.  A film crew is divided into different departments, each of which specializes in a specific aspect of the production. 

Fear<====>10828<====>Fear   Fear is a feeling induced by perceived danger or threat that occurs in certain types of organisms, which causes a change in metabolic and organ functions and ultimately a change in behavior, such as fleeing, hiding, or freezing from perceived traumatic events.  Fear in human beings may occur in response to a specific stimulus occurring in the present, or in anticipation or expectation of a future threat perceived as a risk to body or life.  The fear response arises from the perception of danger leading to confrontation with or escape from/avoiding the threat (also known as the fight-or-flight response), which in extreme cases of fear (horror and terror) can be a freeze response or paralysis. 

Football team<====>10830<====>Football team A football team is a group of players selected to play together in the various team sports known as football.  Such teams could be selected to play in a match against an opposing team, to represent a football club, group, state or nation, an all-star team or even selected as a hypothetical team (such as a   or Team of the Century) and never play an actual match.   SummaryThere are several varieties of football, notably association football, gridiron football, Australian rules football, Gaelic football, rugby league and rugby union.  The number of players selected for each team within these varieties and their associated codes can vary substantially. 

F<====>10831<====>F F (named ef   )  is the sixth letter in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet. HistoryProto-Semitic W Phoenician   waw Greek   Digamma Etruscan V or W Roman F The origin of 'F' is the Semitic letter vâv (or waw) that represented a sound like   or  .  Graphically it originally probably depicted either a hook or a club.  It may have been based on a comparable Egyptian hieroglyph such as that which represented the word mace (transliterated as ḥ(dj)):  T3 The Phoenician form of the letter was adopted into Greek as a vowel, upsilon (which resembled its descendant 'Y' but was also the ancestor of the Roman letters 'U', 'V', and 'W'); and, with another form, as a consonant, digamma, which indicated the pronunciation  , as in Phoenician. 

Food preservation<====>10834<====>Food preservation  Food preservation is to prevent the growth of microorganisms (such as yeasts), or other microorganisms (although some methods work by introducing benign bacteria or fungi to the food), as well as slowing the oxidation of fats that cause rancidity.  Food preservation may also include processes that inhibit visual deterioration, such as the enzymatic browning reaction in apples after they are cut during food preparation. Many processes designed to preserve food involve more than one food preservation method.  Preserving fruit by turning it into jam, for example, involves boiling (to reduce the fruit’s moisture content and to kill bacteria, etc. 

Frequency modulation<====>10835<====>Frequency modulation  In telecommunications and signal processing, frequency modulation (FM) is the encoding of information in a carrier wave by varying the instantaneous frequency of the wave. In analog frequency modulation, such as FM radio broadcasting of an audio signal representing voice or music, the instantaneous frequency deviation, the difference between the frequency of the carrier and its center frequency, is proportional to the modulating signal. Digital data can be encoded and transmitted via FM by shifting the carrier's frequency among a predefined set of frequencies representing digits - for example one frequency can represent a binary 1 and a second can represent binary 0. 

Faith and rationality<====>10837<====>Faith and rationalityFaith and rationality are two ideologies that exist in varying degrees of conflict or compatibility.  Rationality is based on reason or facts.  Faith is belief in inspiration, revelation, or authority.  The word faith sometimes refers to a belief that is held with lack of reason or evidence, a belief that is held in spite of or against reason or evidence, or it can refer to belief based upon a degree of evidential warrant. Although the words faith and belief are sometimes erroneously conflated  and used as synonyms, faith properly refers to a particular type (or subset) of belief, as defined above.

F wave<====>10842<====>F wave  In neuroscience, an F wave is the second of two voltage changes observed after electrical stimulation is applied to the skin surface above the distal region of a nerve.  F waves are often used to measure nerve conduction velocity, and are particularly useful for evaluating conduction problems in the proximal region of nerves (i. e. , portions of nerves near the spinal cord). It's called F wave because it was initially recorded in the foot muscles.  OverviewIn a typical F wave study, a strong electrical stimulus (supramaximal stimulation) is applied to the skin surface above the distal portion of a nerve so that the impulse travels both distally (towards the muscle fiber) and proximally (back to the motor neurons of the spinal cord). 

Fruit<====>10843<====>Fruit   In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds.  Edible fruits, in particular, have propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and nutrition; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.Accordingly, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings. 

French materialism<====>10844<====>French materialismFrench materialism is the name given to a handful of French 18th-century philosophers during the Age of Enlightenment, many of them clustered around the salon of Baron d'Holbach.

Fictional language<====>10853<====>Fictional language Fictional languages are constructed languages created as part of a fictional setting, for example in books, movies and video games.  Fictional languages are intended to be the languages of a fictional world and are often designed with the intent of giving more depth and an appearance of plausibility to the fictional worlds with which they are associated, and to have their characters communicate in a fashion which is both alien and dislocated.  Some of these languages, e. g. , in worlds of fantasy fiction, alternate universes, Earth's future, or  alternate history, are presented as distorted versions or dialects of modern English or other natural language, while others are independently designed conlangs. 

Formula One<====>10854<====>Formula One  Formula One (also Formula 1 or F1 and officially the FIA Formula One World Championship) is the highest class of single-seat auto racing that is sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA).

Stage (stratigraphy)<====>10857<====>Stage (stratigraphy) In chronostratigraphy, a stage is a succession of rock strata laid down in a single age on the geologic timescale, which usually represents millions of years of deposition.   A given stage of rock and the corresponding age of time will by convention have the same name, and the same boundaries. Rock series are divided into stages, just as geological epochs are divided into ages.   Stages can be divided into smaller stratigraphic units called chronozones.   (See chart at right for full terminology hierarchy. ) Stages may also be divided into substages or indeed grouped as superstages. 

Franz Kafka<====>10858<====>Franz Kafka   Franz Kafka  (3 July 1883 – 3 June 1924) was a German-speaking Bohemian Jewish novelist and short story writer, widely regarded as one of the major figures of 20th-century literature.  His work, which fuses elements of realism and the fantastic,  typically features isolated protagonists faced by bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible social-bureaucratic powers, and has been interpreted as exploring themes of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and absurdity.His best known works include " " ("The Metamorphosis"),(The Trial), and   (The Castle).  The term Kafkaesque has entered the English language to describe situations like those in his writing. 

Fields Medal<====>10859<====>Fields Medal  The Fields Medal is a prize awarded to two, three, or four mathematicians under 40 years of age at the International Congress of the International Mathematical Union (IMU), a meeting that takes place every four years (on even years). The Fields Medal is, with the Abel Prize, viewed as the highest honour a mathematician can receive.    The Fields Medal and the Abel Prize have often been described as the mathematician's "Nobel Prize".  The Fields Medal differs from the Abel in view of the age restriction mentioned above, and in its frequency (awarded once every four years). 

The Trial<====>10861<====>The Trial    The Trial (original German title:  ,  later  ,   and  ) is a novel written by Franz Kafka between 1914 and 1915 and published posthumously in 1925.  One of his best-known works, it tells the story of a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote, inaccessible authority, with the nature of his crime revealed neither to him nor to the reader.  Heavily influenced by Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov, Kafka even went so far as to call Dostoyevsky a blood relative.   Like Kafka's other novels, The Trial was never completed, although it does include a chapter which brings the story to an end. 

The Metamorphosis<====>10862<====>The Metamorphosis  The Metamorphosis ( ) is a novella written by Franz Kafka which was first published in 1915. PlotPart IOne day, Gregor Samsa, a traveling salesman, wakes up to find himself transformed into a  giant insect (the most common translation of the German description ungeheures Ungeziefer, literally "monstrous vermin").  He reflects on how dreary life as a traveling salesman is.  As he looks at the wall clock, he notices that he has overslept and missed his train for work.  He ponders the consequences of this delay.  Gregor becomes annoyed at how his boss never accepts excuses or explanations from any of his employees no matter how hard-working they are, displaying an apparent lack of trusting abilities. 

Francisco Goya<====>10868<====>Francisco Goya    Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes  ( ;  ; 30 March 1746 – 16 April 1828) was a Spanish romantic painter and printmaker.  He is considered the most important Spanish artist of late 18th and early 19th centuries and throughout his long career was a commentator and chronicler of his era.  Immensely successful in his lifetime, Goya is often referred to as both the last of the Old Masters and the first of the moderns.   He was also one of the great contemporary portraitists.

Frequentist probability<====>10869<====>Frequentist probability  Frequentist probability or frequentism is an interpretation of probability; it defines an event's probability as the limit of its relative frequency in a large number of trials.   This interpretation supports the statistical needs of experimental scientists and pollsters; probabilities can be found (in principle) by a repeatable objective process (and are thus ideally devoid of opinion).   It does not support all needs; gamblers typically require estimates of the odds without experiments. The development of the frequentist account was motivated by the problems and paradoxes of the previously dominant viewpoint, the classical interpretation.   In the classical interpretation, probability was defined in terms of the principle of indifference, based on the natural symmetry of a problem, so, e.

Plurality voting<====>10880<====>Plurality votingPlurality voting is an electoral system in which each voter is allowed to vote for only one candidate, and the candidate who polls the most among their counterparts (a plurality) is elected.  In a system based on single-member districts, it may be called first-past-the-post (FPTP), single-choice voting, simple plurality or relative/simple majority.  In a system based on multi-member districts, it may be referred to as winner-takes-all or bloc voting.  The system is often used to elect members of a legislative assembly or executive officers.  It is the most common form of the system, and is used in Canada, the lower house (Lok Sabha) in India, most elections in the United Kingdom (excluding some Scottish and Northern Irish elections), and most elections in the United States. 

February 14<====>10882<====>February 14 Events748 – Abbasid Revolution: The Hashimi rebels under Abu Muslim Khorasani take Merv, capital of the Umayyad province Khorasan, marking the consolidation of the Abbasid revolt. 842 – Charles the Bald and Louis the German swear the Oaths of Strasbourg in the French and German languages. 1014 – Pope Benedict VIII crowns Henry of Bavaria, King of Germany and of Italy, as Holy Roman Emperor. 1076 – Pope Gregory VII excommunicates Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. 1130 – Pope Innocent II is elected. 1349 – Several hundred Jews are burned to death by mobs while the remaining Jews are forcibly removed from Strasbourg. 

Free-trade area<====>10883<====>Free-trade area   A free-trade area is the region encompassing a trade bloc whose member countries have signed a free-trade agreement (FTA).  Such agreements involve cooperation between at least two countries to reduce trade barriers  import quotas and tariffs  and to increase trade of goods and services with each other.  If people are also free to move between the countries, in addition to a free-trade agreement, it would also be considered an open border.  It can be considered the second stage of economic integration. DescriptionUnlike a customs union (the third stage of economic integration), members of a free trade area do not have a common external tariff, which means they have different quotas and customs taxes, as well as other policies with respect to non-members. 

French fries<====>10885<====>French friesFrench fries (North American English), chips (British English),   finger chips (Indian English),  or French-fried potatoes are batonnet or allumette-cut deep-fried potatoes.  In the United States and most of Canada, the term fries refers to all dishes of fried elongated pieces of potatoes, while in the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa (rarely), Ireland and New Zealand, thinly cut fried potatoes are sometimes called shoestring fries or skinny fries to distinguish them from the thicker-cut chips. French fries are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner or by themselves as a snack, and they commonly appear on the menus of diners, fast food restaurants, pubs, and bars. 

Field hockey<====>10886<====>Field hockey  Field hockey is a team sport of the hockey family.  The earliest origins of the game date back to the Middle Ages in England, Scotland, France and the Netherlands.   The game can be played on a grass field, turf field or synthetic field as well as an indoor board surface.  Each team plays with eleven players, including the goalie.  Players use sticks made out of wood, carbon fibre, fibre glass or a combination of carbon fibre and fibre glass in different quantities (with the higher carbon fibre stick being more expensive and less likely to break) to hit a round, hard, plastic ball. 

Finagle's law<====>10887<====>Finagle's lawFinagle's law of dynamic negatives, also known as Melody's law or Finagle's corollary to Murphy's law, is usually rendered: The term "Finagle's law" was first used by John W.  Campbell, Jr. , the influential editor of Astounding Science Fiction (later Analog).  He used it frequently in his editorials for many years in the 1940s to 1960s,  but it never came into general usage the way Murphy's law has. VariantsOne variant (known as O'Toole's corollary of Finagle's law) favored among hackers is a takeoff on the second law of thermodynamics (related to the augmentation of entropy): In the Star Trek episode "The Ultimate Computer", Dr. 

Fundamental interaction<====>10890<====>Fundamental interaction In physics, the fundamental interactions, also known as fundamental forces, are the interactions that do not appear to be reducible to more basic interactions.  There are four fundamental interactions known to exist:  the gravitational and electromagnetic interactions, which produce significant long-range forces whose effects can be seen directly in everyday life, and the strong, & weak interactions, which produce forces at minuscule, subatomic distances and govern nuclear interactions.  Some scientistsspeculate that a fifth force might exist but if so, it is not widely accepted nor proven. 

Floppy disk<====>10891<====>Floppy disk A floppy disk, also called a floppy, diskette, or just disk, is a type of disk storage composed of a disk of thin and flexible magnetic storage medium, sealed in a rectangular plastic enclosure lined with fabric that removes dust particles.  Floppy disks are read and written by a floppy disk drive (FDD). Floppy disks, initially as   media  and later in 5¼-inch (133 mm) and 3½-inch (90 mm) sizes, were a ubiquitous form of data storage and exchange from the mid-1970s into the first years of the 21st century.By 2006 computers were rarely manufactured with installed floppy disk drives; 3½-inch floppy disks can be used with an external USB floppy disk drive, but USB drives for 5¼-inch, 8-inch, and non-standard diskettes are rare to non-existent. 

Fencing<====>10893<====>FencingFencing is a sport in which two competitors fight using 'rapier-style' swords, called the foil, the épée, and the sabre; winning points are made through the contact with an opponent.  Fencing was one of the first sports to be played in the Olympics.  Based on the traditional skills of swordsmanship, the modern sport arose at the end of the 19th century, with the Italian school having modified the historical European martial art of classical fencing, and the French school later refining the Italian system.  There are three forms of modern fencing, each uses a different kind of weapon and has different rules, this way the sport itself is divided into three competitive scenes: foil, épée, and sabre. 

The Free Software Definition<====>10894<====>The Free Software DefinitionThe Free Software Definition written by Richard Stallman and published by Free Software Foundation (FSF), defines free software as being software that ensures that the end users have freedom in using, studying, sharing and modifying that software.  The term "free" is used in the sense of "free speech," not of "free of charge. "  The earliest known publication of the definition was in the February 1986 edition    of the now-discontinued GNU's Bulletin publication of FSF.  The canonical source for the document is in the philosophy section of the GNU Project website. 

Felix Bloch<====>10896<====>Felix Bloch   Felix Bloch (23 October 1905 – 10 September 1983) was a Swiss physicist, working mainly in the U. S.   He and Edward Mills Purcell were awarded the 1952 Nobel Prize for Physics for "their development of new ways  and methods for nuclear magnetic precision measurements. " Sohlman, M (Ed. ) Nobel Foundation directory 2003.  Vastervik, Sweden: AB CO Ekblad; 2003.    In 1954–1955, he served for one year as the first Director-General of CERN.  Felix Bloch made fundamental theoretical contributions to the understanding of the behavior electrons in crystal lattices, ferromagnetism, and nuclear magnetic resonance. 

Fugue<====>10897<====>Fugue In music, a fugue (   ) is a contrapuntal compositional technique in two or more voices, built on a subject (a musical theme) that is introduced at the beginning in imitation (repetition at different pitches) and which recurs frequently in the course of the composition.  It is not to be confused with a fuguing tune, which is a style of song popularized by and mostly limited to early American (i. e.  shape note or "Sacred Harp") music and West Gallery music.  A fugue usually has three main sections: an exposition, a development, and a final entry that contains the return of the subject in the fugue's tonic key. 

Fugue state<====>10898<====>Fugue state  Dissociative fugue, formerly fugue state or psychogenic fugue, is a dissociative disorder.  Dissociative Fugue (formerly Psychogenic Fugue) (DSM-IV 300. 13, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition )  It is a rare psychiatric disorder characterized by reversible amnesia for personal identity, including the memories, personality, and other identifying characteristics of individuality.  The state can last days, months or longer.  Dissociative fugue usually involves unplanned travel or wandering, and is sometimes accompanied by the establishment of a new identity.  It is a facet of dissociative amnesia, according to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). 

Force<====>10902<====>Force    In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object.   A force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i. e. , to accelerate.  Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull.  A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity.   It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F. The original form of Newton's second law states that the net force acting upon an object is equal to the rate at which its momentum changes with time. 

Family law<====>10905<====>Family law  Family law (also called matrimonial law or the law of domestic relations) is an area of the law that deals with family matters and domestic relations.    OverviewSubjects that commonly fall under a nation's body of family law include: Marriage, civil unions, and domestic partnerships:Entry into legally recognized spousal and domestic relationships The termination of legally recognized family relationships and ancillary matters, including divorce, annulment, property settlements, alimony, child custody and visitation, child support and alimony awards Adoption: proceedings to adopt a child and, in some cases, an adult.  Surrogacy: the law and process of giving birth as a surrogate mother Child protective proceedings: court proceedings that may result from state intervention in cases of child abuse and child neglect Juvenile law: Matters relating to minors including status offenses, delinquency, emancipation and juvenile adjudication Paternity: proceedings to establish and disestablish paternity, and the administration of paternity testing This list is not exhaustive and varies depending on jurisdiction. 

Foonly<====>10909<====>Foonly Foonly was a short-lived American computer company formed by Dave Poole, one of the principal Super Foonly designers as well as one of hackerdom's more colourful personalities.  The company produced a series of DEC PDP-10 compatible computers, first the high-performance F-1, and later a series of smaller and less expensive designs.  The first Foonly machine, the F-1, was the computational engine used to create some of the graphics in the 1982 film Tron. PDP-10 successorThe PDP-10 successor was to have been built by the Super Foonly project at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) along with a new operating system. 

Functional group<====>10911<====>Functional group  In organic chemistry, functional groups are specific groups (moieties) of atoms or bonds within molecules that are responsible for the characteristic chemical reactions of those molecules.  The same functional group will undergo the same or similar chemical reaction(s) regardless of the size of the molecule it is a part of.    However, its relative reactivity can be modified by other functional groups nearby.  The atoms of functional groups are linked to each other and to the rest of the molecule by covalent bonds.  Functional groups can also be charged, e. g.  in carboxylate salts (–COO − ), which turns the molecule into a polyatomic ion or a complex ion. 

Fractal<====>10913<====>Fractal   In mathematics a fractal is an abstract object used to describe and simulate naturally occurring objects.  Artificially created fractals commonly exhibit similar patterns at increasingly small scales.It is also known as expanding symmetry or evolving symmetry.  If the replication is exactly the same at every scale, it is called a self-similar pattern.  An example of this is the Menger sponge.   Fractals can also be nearly the same at different levels.  This latter pattern is illustrated in small magnifications of the Mandelbrot set. Fractals also include the idea of a detailed pattern that repeats itself. 

Fluid<====>10915<====>Fluid    In physics, a fluid is a substance that continually deforms (flows) under an applied shear stress.   Fluids are a subset of the phases of matter and include liquids, gases, plasmas, and to some extent, plastic solids.  Fluids are substances that have zero shear modulus, or, in simpler terms, a fluid is a substance which cannot resist any shear force applied to it.  Although the term "fluid" includes both the liquid and gas phases, in common usage, "fluid" is often used as a synonym for "liquid", with no implication that gas could also be present. 

FAQ<====>10916<====>FAQ  Frequently asked questions (FAQ) or Questions and Answers (Q&A), are listed questions and answers, all supposed to be commonly asked in some context, and pertaining to a particular topic.  The format is commonly used on email mailing lists and other online forums, where certain common questions tend to recur. "FAQ" is pronounced as either an initialism (F-A-Q) or an acronym.  Since the acronym FAQ originated in textual media, its pronunciation varies; "F-A-Q",    is commonly heard.  Depending on usage, the term may refer specifically to a single frequently asked question, or to an assembled list of many questions and their answers. 

Fibonacci number<====>10918<====>Fibonacci numberIn mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones:   1,\;1,\;2,\;3,\;5,\;8,\;13,\;21,\;34,\;55,\;89,\;144,\; \ldots Often, especially in modern usage, the sequence is extended by one more initial term: 0,\;1,\;1,\;2,\;3,\;5,\;8,\;13,\;21,\;34,\;55,\;89,\;144,\; \ldots .  By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are either 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. The sequence F n  of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation: F_n=F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}, with seed values   F_1=1,\; F_2=1 or  F_0=0,\; F_1=1. 

Fontainebleau<====>10923<====>Fontainebleau  Fontainebleau ( ;  )  is a commune in the metropolitan area of Paris, France.  It is located   south-southeast of the centre of Paris.  Fontainebleau is a sub-prefecture of the Seine-et-Marne department, and it is the seat of the arrondissement of Fontainebleau.  The commune has the largest land area in the Île-de-France region; it is the only one to cover a larger area than Paris itself. Fontainebleau, together with the neighbouring commune of Avon and three other smaller communes, form an urban area of 39,713 inhabitants (according to the 2001 census).  This urban area is a satellite of Paris. 

Fighter aircraft<====>10929<====>Fighter aircraft  A fighter aircraft is a military aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat against other aircraft,  as opposed to bombers and attack aircraft, whose main mission is to attack ground targets.  The hallmarks of a fighter are its speed, maneuverability, and small size relative to other combat aircraft. Many fighters have secondary ground-attack capabilities, and some are designed as dual-purpose fighter-bombers; often aircraft that do not fulfill the standard definition are called fighters.  This may be for political or national security reasons, for advertising purposes, or other reasons.  A fighter's main purpose is to establish air superiority over a battlefield. 

February 25<====>10930<====>February 25Events138 – The Roman emperor Hadrian adopts Antoninus Pius, effectively making him his successor. 493 – Odoacer surrenders Ravenna after a 3-year siege and agrees to a mediated peace with Theoderic the Great. 628 – Khosrow II, the last great king of the Sasanian Empire, is overthrown by his son Kavadh II. 1336 – Four thousand defenders of Pilėnai commit mass suicide rather than be taken captive by the Teutonic Knights. 1631 – François de Bassompierre, a French courtier, is arrested on Richelieu's orders. 1797 – Colonel William Tate and his force of 1000–1500 soldiers surrender after the Last invasion of Britain. 

Finite-state machine<====>10931<====>Finite-state machine    A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (FSA, plural: automata), finite automaton, or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computation.   It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time.   The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition.  An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition. The behavior of state machines can be observed in many devices in modern society that perform a predetermined sequence of actions depending on a sequence of events with which they are presented. 

Functional programming<====>10933<====>Functional programming  In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.  It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions    or declarations    instead of statements.  In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x produces the same result f(x) each time; this is in contrast to procedures depending on a local or global state, which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state. 

February 29<====>10936<====>February 29  February 29, also known as leap day or leap year day, is a date added to most years that are divisible by 4, such as 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, and 2024.  A leap day is added in various solar calendars (calendars based on the Earth's revolution around the Sun), including the Gregorian calendar standard in most of the world.  Lunisolar calendars (whose months are based on the phases of the Moon) instead add a leap or intercalary month.    In the Gregorian calendar, years that are divisible by 100, but not by 400, do not contain a leap day. 

Francis Scott Key<====>10937<====>Francis Scott Key  Francis Scott Key (August 1, 1779 January 11, 1843) was an American lawyer, author, and amateur poet from Frederick, Maryland and later Georgetown, D. C. , near Washington, D. C.  who wrote the lyrics for a poem entitled at first "The Defence of Fort McHenry", which when set to an old English gentlemen's society tune,  eventually became the United States' national anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner". Early life and familyFrancis Scott Key was born to Ann Phoebe Penn Dagworthy (Charlton) and Captain John Ross Key at the family plantation Terra Rubra in what was then part of Frederick County, now Carroll County, Maryland. 

Formal language<====>10939<====>Formal language  In mathematics, computer science, and linguistics, a formal language is a set of strings of symbols together with a set of rules that are specific to it. The alphabet of a formal language is the set of symbols, letters, or tokens from which the strings of the language may be formed.   The strings formed from this alphabet are called words, and the words that belong to a particular formal language are sometimes called well-formed words or well-formed formulas.  A formal language is often defined by means of a formal grammar such as a regular grammar or context-free grammar, also called its formation rule. 

Free to Choose<====>10940<====>Free to Choose   Free to Choose: A Personal Statement (1980) is a book and a ten-part television series broadcast on public television by economists Milton and Rose D.  Friedman that advocates free market principles.  It was primarily a response to an earlier landmark book and television series: The Age of Uncertainty, by the noted economist John Kenneth Galbraith.  Milton Friedman won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1976. OverviewFree to Choose: A Personal Statement maintains that the free market works best for all members of a society, provides examples of how the free market engenders prosperity, and maintains that it can solve problems where other approaches have failed. 

Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit<====>10945<====>Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit   The Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit is a street circuit around Albert Park Lake, only a few kilometres south of central Melbourne.  It is used annually as a racetrack for the Formula One Australian Grand Prix, Supercars Melbourne 400 and associated support races.  The circuit has FIA Grade 1 licence.   In spite of being a circuit on public roads it has characteristics of a natural road course considering it being fast and flowing combined with extensive runoff in many corners. The Australian Grand Prix has always been more of a promoter event than a profit-raiser in itself. 

Monaco Grand Prix<====>10946<====>Monaco Grand PrixThe Monaco Grand Prix ( ) is a Formula One motor race held each year on the Circuit de Monaco.  Run since 1929, it is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world and, with the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans, forms the Triple Crown of Motorsport.  The circuit has been called "an exceptional location of glamour and prestige".    The race is held on a narrow course laid out in the streets of Monaco, with many elevation changes and tight corners as well as a tunnel, making it one of the most demanding tracks in Formula One. 

Four color theorem<====>10949<====>Four color theoremIn mathematics, the four color theorem, or the four color map theorem, states that, given any separation of a plane into contiguous regions, producing a figure called a map, no more than four colors are required to color the regions of the map so that no two adjacent regions have the same color.  Two regions are called adjacent if they share a common boundary that is not a corner, where corners are the points shared by three or more regions.  Despite the motivation from coloring political maps of countries, the theorem is not of particular interest to cartographers. 

Fahrenheit 451<====>10951<====>Fahrenheit 451  {{Infobox book  HUAC began investigating Hollywood is often considered the beginning of the Cold War, as in March 1947, the Truman Doctrine was announced.  By about 1950, the Cold War was in full swing, and the American public's fear of nuclear warfare and communist influence was at a feverish level.  The stage was set for Bradbury to write the dramatic nuclear holocaust ending of Fahrenheit 451, exemplifying the type of scenario feared by many Americans of the time.  Bradbury's early life witnessed the Golden Age of Radio, while the transition to the Golden Age of Television began right around the time he started to work on the stories that would eventually lead to Fahrenheit 451. 

Francis Xavier<====>10957<====>Francis XavierSaint Francis Xavier, S. J.  (born Francisco de Jasso y Azpilicueta, 7 April 1506 3 December 1552), was a Navarrese Basque Roman Catholic missionary, born in Javier (Xavier in Navarro-Aragonese or Xabier in Basque), Kingdom of Navarre (present day Spain), and a co-founder of the Society of Jesus.  He was a companion of Saint Ignatius of Loyola and one of the first seven Jesuits who took vows of poverty and chastity at Montmartre, Paris in 1534.   He led an extensive mission into Asia, mainly in the Portuguese Empire of the time and was influential in evangelization work, most notably in India. 

Fossil<====>10958<====>FossilA fossil (from Classical Latin fossilis; literally, "obtained by digging")  is any preserved remains, impression, or trace of any once-living thing from a past geological age.  Examples include bones, shells, exoskeletons, stone imprints of animals or microbes, hair, petrified wood, oil, coal, and DNA remnants.  The totality of fossils is known as the fossil record. Paleontology is the study of fossils: their age, method of formation, and evolutionary significance.   Specimens are usually considered to be fossils if they are over 10,000 years old.    The oldest fossils are from around 3. 

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act<====>10960<====>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act  The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA or the Buckley Amendment) is a United States federal law that governs the access of educational information and records.  OverviewFERPA gives parents access to their child's education records, an opportunity to seek to have the records amended, and some control over the disclosure of information from the records.  With several exceptions, schools must have a student's consent prior to the disclosure of education records after that student is 18 years old.  The law applies only to educational agencies and institutions that receive funding under a program administered by the U. 

Forgetting<====>10963<====>ForgettingForgetting or disremembering is the apparent loss or modification of information already encoded and stored in an individual's long-term memory.  It is a spontaneous or gradual process in which old memories are unable to be recalled from memory storage.  Forgetting also helps to reconcile the storage of new information with old knowledge.   Problems with remembering, learning and retaining new information are a few of the most common complaints of older adults.Memory performance is usually related to the active functioning of three stages.  These three stages are encoding, storage and retrieval. 

Fay Wray<====>10965<====>Fay Wray  Vina Fay Wray (September 15, 1907 – August 8, 2004) was a Canadian actor most noted for playing the female lead in the 1933 film King Kong as Ann Darrow.  Through an acting career that spanned 57 years, Wray attained international renown as an actress in horror movie roles.   She was one of the first "scream queens". After appearing in minor movie roles, Wray gained media attention being selected as one of the "WAMPAS Baby Stars".  This led to her being contracted to Paramount Pictures as a teenager, where she made more than a dozen movies. 

Forgetting curve<====>10967<====>Forgetting curve The forgetting curve hypothesizes the decline of memory retention in time.  This curve shows how information is lost over time when there is no attempt to retain it.  Curve of Forgetting | Counselling Services    A related concept is the strength of memory that refers to the durability that memory traces in the brain.  The stronger the memory, the longer period of time that a person is able to recall it.  A typical graph of the forgetting curve purports to show that humans tend to halve their memory of newly learned knowledge in a matter of days or weeks unless they consciously review the learned material. 

Field-programmable gate array<====>10969<====>Field-programmable gate array A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing  hence "field-programmable".  The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language (HDL), similar to that used for an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC).  (Circuit diagrams were previously used to specify the configuration, as they were for ASICs, but this is increasingly rare. )FPGAs contain an array of programmable logic blocks, and a hierarchy of reconfigurable interconnects that allow the blocks to be "wired together", like many logic gates that can be inter-wired in different configurations. 

Free-running sleep<====>10971<====>Free-running sleepFree-running sleep is a sleep pattern that is not adjusted (entrained) to the 24-hour cycle in nature nor to any artificial cycle. It occurs as the sleep disorder non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder or artificially as part of experiments used in the study of circadian and other rhythms in biology.  Study subjects are shielded from all time cues, often by a constant light protocol, by a constant dark protocol or by the use of light/dark conditions to which the organism cannot entrain such as the ultrashort protocol of one hour dark and two hours light.  Also, limited amounts of food may be made available at short intervals so as to avoid entrainment to mealtimes. 

Fenrir<====>10972<====>Fenrir  Fenrir (Old Norse: "fen-dweller") Orchard (1997:42).   or Fenrisúlfr (Old Norse: "Fenrir's wolf", often translated "Fenris-wolf"), Simek (2007:81).   also referred to as Hróðvitnir ("fame-wolf") Simek (2007:160).   and Vánagandr ("monster of the [River] Ván"), Simek (2007:350).   is a monstrous wolf in Norse mythology.  Fenrir is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda and Heimskringla, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson.  In both the Poetic Edda and Prose Edda, Fenrir is the father of the wolves Sköll and Hati Hróðvitnisson, is a son of Loki, and is foretold to kill the god Odin during the events of Ragnarök, but will in turn be killed by Odin's son Víðarr. 

Final Fantasy<====>10974<====>Final FantasyFinal Fantasy  is a science fiction and fantasy media franchise created by Hironobu Sakaguchi, and developed and owned by Square Enix (formerly Square).  The franchise centers on a series of fantasy and science fantasy role-playing video games (RPGs).  The first game in the series, published in 1987, was conceived by Sakaguchi as his last-ditch effort in the game industry; it was a success and spawned sequels.  The series has since branched into other genres such as tactical role-playing, action role-playing, massively multiplayer online role-playing, racing, third-person shooter, fighting, and rhythm. 

Fatty acid<====>10975<====>Fatty acid  In chemistry, particularly in biochemistry, a fatty acid is a carboxylic acid with a long aliphatic chain, which is either saturated or unsaturated.  Most naturally occurring fatty acids have an unbranched chain of an even number of carbon atoms, from 4 to 28.Fatty acids are usually derived from triglycerides or phospholipids.  Fatty acids are important dietary sources of fuel for animals because, when metabolized, they yield large quantities of ATP.  Many cell types can use either glucose or fatty acids for this purpose.  Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and so cannot be used as fuel by the cells of the central nervous system;  however, free short-chain fatty acids and medium-chain fatty acids can cross the BBB,  in addition to glucose and ketone bodies. 

Fearless (1993 film)<====>10977<====>Fearless (1993 film) Fearless is a 1993 American drama film directed by Peter Weir and starring Jeff Bridges, Isabella Rossellini, Rosie Perez and John Turturro.  It was written by Rafael Yglesias from his novel of the same name.  Rosie Perez was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Carla Rodrigo.  The film was also entered into the 44th Berlin International Film Festival.Jeff Bridges' role as Max Klein is widely regarded as one of the best performances of his career.The film's soundtrack features part of the first movement of Henryk Górecki's Symphony No. 

Franklin D. Roosevelt<====>10979<====>Franklin D.  Roosevelt Franklin Delano Roosevelt ( ;  January 30, 1882 – April 12, 1945), commonly known as FDR, was an American statesman and political leader who served as the 32nd President of the United States from 1933 until his death in 1945.  A Democrat, he won a record four presidential elections and emerged as a central figure in world events during the mid-20th century.  Roosevelt directed the United States federal government during most of the Great Depression, implementing his New Deal domestic agenda in response to the worst economic crisis in U. 

Four Freedoms<====>10980<====>Four Freedoms  The Four Freedoms were goals articulated by United States President Franklin D.  Roosevelt on Monday, January 6, 1941.   In an address known as the   (technically the 1941 State of the Union address), he proposed four fundamental freedoms that people "everywhere in the world" ought to enjoy:Freedom of speechFreedom of worshipFreedom from wantFreedom from fearRoosevelt delivered his speech 11 months before the United States declared war on Japan, December 8, 1941.  The State of the Union speech before Congress was largely about the national security of the United States and the threat to other democracies from world war that was being waged across the continents in the eastern hemisphere. 

First-order logic<====>10983<====>First-order logic First-order logic—also known as first-order predicate calculus and predicate logic—is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science.  First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as Socrates is a man one can have expressions in the form "there exists X such that X is Socrates and X is a man" and there exists is a quantifier while X is a variable.   This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers or relations. 

Functor<====>10987<====>Functor In mathematics, a functor is a type of mapping between categories arising in category theory.  Functors can be thought of as homomorphisms between categories.  In the category of small categories, functors can be thought of more generally as morphisms. Functors were first considered in algebraic topology, where algebraic objects (like the fundamental group) are associated to topological spaces, and algebraic homomorphisms are associated to continuous maps.  Nowadays, functors are used throughout modern mathematics to relate various categories.  Thus, functors are generally applicable in areas within mathematics that category theory can make an abstraction of. The word functor was borrowed by mathematicians from the philosopher Rudolf Carnap,  who used the term in a linguistic context; see function word. 

Felix Hausdorff<====>10989<====>Felix Hausdorff  Felix Hausdorff (November 8, 1868 – January 26, 1942) was a German mathematician who is considered to be one of the founders of modern topology and who contributed significantly to set theory, descriptive set theory, measure theory, function theory,  and functional analysis. Life became difficult for Hausdorff and his family after Kristallnacht in 1938.  The next year he initiated efforts to emigrate to the United States, but was unable to make arrangements to receive a research fellowship.  On 26 January 1942, Felix Hausdorff, along with his wife and his sister-in-law, committed suicide by taking an overdose of veronal, rather than comply with German orders to move to the Endenich camp, and there suffer the likely implications, about which he held no illusions. 

Fimbulwinter<====>10990<====>FimbulwinterIn Norse mythology, Fimbulvetr (or fimbulvinter), commonly rendered in English as Fimbulwinter, is the immediate prelude to the events of Ragnarök.  It means "great winter". SummaryFimbulvetr is the harsh winter that precedes the end of the world and puts an end to all life on Earth.  Fimbulwinter is three successive winters, when snow comes in from all directions, without any intervening summer.  Then, there will be innumerable wars. The event is described primarily in the Poetic Edda.  In the poem Vafþrúðnismál, Odin poses the question to Vafþrúðnir as to who of mankind will survive the Fimbulwinter.

Frankfurt<====>10992<====>Frankfurt   Frankfurt, officially Frankfurt am Main ("Frankfurt on Main",  ), is a metropolis and the largest city in the German state of Hesse and the fifth-largest city in Germany.  Frankfurt was a city state, the Free City of Frankfurt, for nearly five centuries, and was one of the most important cities of the Holy Roman Empire; it lost its sovereignty in 1866. In 2015, Frankfurt has a population of 732,688 within its administrative boundaries,    and 2. 3 million in its urban area.   European Union: State of European Cities Report   Retrieved 22 April 2014  The city is at the centre of the larger Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region, which has a population of 5. 

Albert of Saxony<====>10993<====>Albert of Saxony    Albert (Frederick Augustus Albert Anton Ferdinand Joseph Karl Maria Baptist Nepomuk Wilhelm Xaver Georg Fidelis; 23 April 1828 – 19 June 1902) was a German King of Saxony and a member of the House of Wettin. He was the eldest son of Prince John, (who succeeded his brother Frederick Augustus II on the Saxon throne as King John in 1854) by his wife Amalie Auguste of Bavaria. Albert had a successful military career leading Saxon troops which participated in the First Schleswig War, the Austro-Prussian War, and the Franco-Prussian War.  Otherwise, his reign as king was largely uneventful. 

François d'Aguilon<====>10996<====>François d'Aguilon François d'Aguilon (also d'Aguillon or in Latin Franciscus Aguilonius) (4 January 1567 – 20 March 1617) was a Belgian Jesuit mathematician, physicist and architect. D'Aguilon was born in Brussels; his father was a secretary to Philip II of Spain.    He became a Jesuit in Tournai in 1586.   In 1598 he moved to Antwerp, where he helped plan the construction of the Saint Carolus Borromeus church.   In 1611, he started a special school of mathematics in Antwerp, fulfilling a dream of Christopher Clavius for a Jesuit mathematical school; in 1616, he was joined there by Grégoire de Saint-Vincent.

Fortified wine<====>10998<====>Fortified wine Fortified wine is a wine to which a distilled spirit, usually brandy, is added.Many different styles of fortified wine have been developed, including Port, Sherry, Madeira, Marsala, Commandaria wine, and the aromatised wine Vermouth.    ProductionOne reason for fortifying wine was to preserve it, since ethanol is a natural antiseptic.  Even though other preservation methods now exist, fortification continues to be used because the process can add distinct flavors to the finished product.  fAlthough grape brandy is most commonly added to produce fortified wines, the additional alcohol may also be neutral spirit that has been distilled from grapes, grain, sugar beets or sugarcane. 

Fred Hoyle<====>11001<====>Fred Hoyle   Sir Fred Hoyle FRS (24 June 1915 – 20 August 2001)    was an English astronomer who formulated the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis.  He also held controversial stances on other scientific matters—in particular his rejection of the "Big Bang" theory, a term coined by him on BBC radio, and his promotion of panspermia as the origin of life on Earth.  He also wrote science fiction novels, short stories and radio plays, and co-authored twelve books with his son, Geoffrey Hoyle. He spent most of his working life at the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge and served as its director for six years. 

French cuisine<====>11002<====>French cuisine  French cuisine consists of the cooking traditions and practices from France. In the 14th century Guillaume Tirel, a court chef known as "Taillevent", wrote Le Viandier, one of the earliest recipe collections of medieval France.  During that time, French cuisine was heavily influenced by Italian cuisine.  In the 17th century, chefs François Pierre La Varenne and Marie-Antoine Carême spearheaded movements that shifted French cooking away from its foreign influences and developed France's own indigenous style.  Cheese and wine are a major part of the cuisine.  They play different roles regionally and nationally, with many variations and appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) (regulated appellation) laws. 

Five-spice powder<====>11003<====>Five-spice powder    Five-spice powder is a spice mixture of five or more spices used primarily in Chinese cuisine but also used in other Asian    and Arabic cookery. Five-spice powder is used for cocktails as well. RecipeWhile there are many variants, a common mix is: Chinese Five Spice at The Epicentre Star anise (bajiao 八角) Cloves (dingxiang 丁香)Chinese cinnamon (rougui 肉桂)Sichuan pepper (huajiao 花椒)Fennel seeds (xiao huixiang 小茴香)Other recipes may contain anise seed, ginger root, nutmeg, turmeric, Amomum villosum pods (砂仁), Amomum cardamomum pods (白豆蔻), licorice, Mandarin orange peel or galangal.  In Southern China, Cinnamomum loureiroi and Mandarin orange peel are commonly used as substitutes for Cinnamomum cassia and cloves respectively, producing a slightly different flavour profile for southern five-spice powders. 

Fundamental group<====>11004<====>Fundamental group  In the mathematical  field of algebraic topology, the fundamental group is a mathematical group associated to any given pointed topological space that provides a way to determine when two paths, starting and ending at a fixed base point, can be continuously deformed into each other.  It records information about the basic shape, or holes, of the topological space.  The fundamental group is the first and simplest homotopy group.  The fundamental group is a topological invariant: homeomorphic topological spaces have the same fundamental group. Fundamental groups can be studied using the theory of covering spaces, since a fundamental group coincides with the group of deck transformations of the associated universal covering space.

February 24<====>11007<====>February 24For superstitious reasons, when the Romans began to intercalate to bring their calendar into line with the solar year, they chose not to place their extra month of Mercedonius after February but within it.   February 24—known in the Roman calendar as "the sixth day before the Kalends of March"—was replaced by the first day of this month since it followed Terminalia, the festival of the Roman god of boundaries.  After the end of Mercedonius, the rest of the days of February were observed and the new year began with the first day of March.

Forth (programming language)<====>11012<====>Forth (programming language)  Forth is an imperative stack-based computer programming language and environment originally designed by Charles "Chuck" Moore.  Language features include structured programming, reflection (the ability to modify the program structure during program execution), concatenative programming (functions are composed with juxtaposition) and extensibility (the programmer can create new commands).  Although not an acronym, the language's name is sometimes spelled with all capital letters as FORTH, following the customary usage during its earlier years. A procedural programming language without type checking, Forth features both interactive execution of commands (making it suitable as a shell for systems that lack a more formal operating system) and the ability to compile sequences of commands for later execution.

In 1515 he traveled to Ethiopia as part of the Portuguese embassy to emperor Lebna Dengel accompanied by returning Ethiopian ambassador Matheus.  The embassy arrived only in 1520 to Ethiopia where he joined long sought Portuguese envoy Pêro da Covilhã.  There he remained six years, returning to Lisbon in 1526-27 having written a report entitled Verdadeira Informação das Terras do Preste João das Indias ("A True Relation of the Lands of Prester John of the Indies"). 1515 embassy to EthiopiaFrancisco Álvares was a chaplain-priest and almoner to King Manuel I of Portugal. 

Francesco Andreini<====>11017<====>Francesco Andreini  Francesco Andreini (c.  1548 – 1624) was an Italian actor mainly of commedia dell'arte plays.   He began his career playing the role of the unsophisticated love-stricken young man.  Later he played the role of Capitan Spavento ("Captain Fright"), a Pickwickian character of excessive fatigue LifeAndreini was born at Pistoia.   He was a member of the company of i Gelosi which Henry IV of France summoned to Paris to his bride, the young queen Marie de Medici, thus introducing the commedia dell'arte style to France.  Both his wife, Isabella Andreini, and their son, Giambattista Andreini, were also distinguished in the arts. 

Fifth Monarchists<====>11018<====>Fifth Monarchists The Fifth Monarchists or Fifth Monarchy Men were an extreme Puritan sectactive from 1649 to 1660 during the Interregnum, following the English Civil Wars of the 17th century.   They took their name from a prophecy in the Book of Daniel that four ancient monarchies (Babylonian, Persian, Macedonian, and Roman) would precede the kingdom of Christ.  They also referred to the year 1666 and its relationship to the biblical Number of the Beast indicating the end of earthly rule by carnal human beings.  They were one of a number of nonconformist dissenting groups that emerged around this time.

February 6<====>11021<====>February 6EventsAD 60 – The earliest date for which the day of the week is known.  A graffito in Pompeii identifies this day as a dies Solis (Sunday).  In modern reckoning, this date would have been a Wednesday.  However, according to the system of astrological hours that was originally used to designate the days of the week, a day that was dies Solis according to its sunset hour would have been dies Mercurii (Wednesday) according to its sunrise hour, the convention that finally won out.  Accordingly, we know that the currently used cycle of weeks has extended unbroken since at least this date. 

Francis Hopkinson<====>11022<====>Francis Hopkinson Francis Hopkinson (September 21,   1737 – May 9, 1791) designed the first official American flag, Continental paper money, and the first U. S.  coin.   He was an author, a composer, and one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence in July 1776, as a delegate from New Jersey.  He served in various roles in the early United States government including as a member of the Second Continental Congress and chairman of the Navy Board.   He also later served as a federal district judge in Pennsylvania after the ratification of the Federal Constitution. 

Honorius (emperor)<====>11023<====>Honorius (emperor)   Honorius ( ; 9 September 384 – 15 August 423) was Western Roman Emperor from 393 to 423.  He was the younger son of emperor Theodosius I and his first wife Aelia Flaccilla, and brother of Arcadius, who was the Eastern Emperor from 395 until his death in 408.  During his reign, Rome was sacked for the first time in almost 800 years.  Even by the standards of the rapidly declining Western Empire, Honorius's reign was precarious and chaotic.  His reign was supported by his principal general, Stilicho, who was successively Honorius's guardian (during his childhood) and his father-in-law (after the emperor became an adult). 

Formant<====>11024<====>FormantA formant, as defined by James Jeans,  is a harmonic of a note that is augmented by a resonance.  Speech researcher, Gunnar Fant,  defines formants as "the spectral peaks of the sound spectrum |P(f)|".  In acoustics generally, a very similar definition is widely used: the Acoustical Society of America defines a formant as: "a range of frequencies [of a complex sound] in which there is an absolute or relative maximum in the sound spectrum".   In speech science and phonetics, however, a formant is also sometimes used to mean acoustic resonance  of the human vocal tract.

Form 1040<====>11029<====>Form 1040 Form 1040 (officially, the "U. S.  Individual Income Tax Return") is one of three IRS tax forms (see variants section for explanations of each) used for personal (individual) federal income tax returns filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by United States residents for tax purposes. Income tax returns for individual calendar year taxpayers are due by Tax Day, which is usually April 15 of the next year, except when April 15 falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday.   In those circumstances, the returns are due on the next business day.   An automatic extension until October 15 to file Form 1040 can be obtained by filing Form 4868. 

Frederick Douglass<====>11033<====>Frederick Douglass    Frederick Douglass (born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey; – February 20, 1895 ) was an African-American social reformer, abolitionist, orator, writer, and statesman.  After escaping from slavery in Maryland, he became a national leader of the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts and New York, gaining note for his dazzling oratory    and incisive antislavery writings.  In his time, he was described by abolitionists as a living counter-example to slaveholders' arguments that slaves lacked the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens.    "Moreover, though he does not make the point explicitly, again the very fact that Douglass is ably disputing this argument on this occasion celebrating a select few's intellect and will (or moral character) — this fact constitutes a living counterexample to the narrowness of the pro-slavery definition of humans. 

Fluid dynamics<====>11034<====>Fluid dynamics In physics and engineering, fluid dynamics  is a subdiscipline of fluid mechanics that describes the flow of fluids (liquids and gases).   It has several subdisciplines, including aerodynamics (the study of air and other gases in motion) and hydrodynamics (the study of liquids in motion).   Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating forces and moments on aircraft, determining the mass flow rate of petroleum through pipelines, predicting weather patterns, understanding nebulae in interstellar space and modelling fission weapon detonation. Fluid dynamics offers a systematic structure—which underlies these practical disciplines—that embraces empirical and semi-empirical laws derived from flow measurement and used to solve practical problems. 

Fin<====>11036<====>Fin A fin is a thin component or appendage attached to a larger body or structure.  Fins typically function as foils that produce lift or thrust, or provide the ability to steer or stabilize motion while traveling in water, air, or other fluid media.  Fins are also used to increase surface areas for heat transfer purposes, or simply as ornamentation.   Fins first evolved on fish as a means of locomotion.  Fish fins are used to generate thrust and control the subsequent motion.  Fish, and other aquatic animals such as cetaceans, actively propel and steer themselves with pectoral and tail fins. 

Freyr<====>11037<====>Freyr Freyr (Old Norse: Lord), sometimes anglicized as Frey, is a widely attested god associated with sacral kingship, virility and prosperity, with sunshine and fair weather, and pictured as a phallic fertility god in Norse mythology.  Freyr is said to "bestow peace and pleasure on mortals. " Freyr, sometimes referred to as Yngvi-Freyr, was especially associated with Sweden and seen as an ancestor of the Swedish royal house. In the Icelandic books the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, Freyr is presented as one of the Vanir, the son of the sea god Njörðr, as well as the twin brother of the goddess Freyja. 

Freyja<====>11038<====>Freyja In Norse mythology, Freyja ( ; Old Norse for "(the) Lady") is a goddess associated with love, sex, beauty, fertility, gold, seiðr, war, and death.  Freyja is the owner of the necklace Brísingamen, rides a chariot pulled by two cats, keeps the boar Hildisvíni by her side, possesses a cloak of falcon feathers, and, by her husband Óðr, is the mother of two daughters, Hnoss and Gersemi.  Along with her brother Freyr (Old Norse "(the) Lord"), her father Njörðr, and her mother (Njörðr's sister, unnamed in sources), she is a member of the Vanir.  Stemming from Old Norse Freyja, modern forms of the name include Freya,  Freyia, and Freja. 

First-class cricket<====>11040<====>First-class cricket First-class cricket is an official classification of the highest standard international or domestic matches in the sport of cricket.  A first-class match is of three or more days' scheduled duration between two sides of eleven players each and is officially adjudged to be worthy of the status by virtue of the standard of the competing teams.  Matches must allow for the teams to play two innings each although, in practice, a team might only play one innings or none at all.  First-class cricket (which for this purpose includes all "important matches" played before 1895), along with historical single wicket and the modern limited overs forms of List A and Twenty20, is one of the highest standard forms of cricket. 

Ferdinand de Saussure<====>11041<====>Ferdinand de Saussure  Ferdinand de Saussure ( ;   ; 26 November 1857 – 22 February 1913) was a Swiss linguist and semiotician.  His ideas laid a foundation for many significant developments in both linguistics and semiology in the 20th century.    He is widely considered one of the founders of 20th-century linguisticsand one of two major founders (together with Charles Sanders Peirce) of semiotics/semiology.  One of his translators, Roy Harris, summarized Saussure's contribution to linguistics and the study of "the whole range of human sciences.  It is particularly marked in linguistics, philosophy, psychology, sociology and anthropology. 

Fat<====>11042<====>Fat Fat is one of the three main macronutrients, along with carbohydrate and protein.   Fats, also known as triglycerides, are esters of three fatty acid chains and the alcohol glycerol.  The terms "lipid", "oil" and "fat" are often confused.  "Lipid" is the general term, though a lipid is not necessarily a triglyceride.  "Oil" normally refers to a lipid with short or unsaturated fatty acid chains that is liquid at room temperature, while "fat" (in the strict sense) may specifically refer to lipids that are solids at room temperature – however, "fat" (in the broad sense) may be used in food science as a synonym for lipid. 

Front line<====>11043<====>Front line   A front line (alternative forms: front-line or frontline) in military terminology is the position(s) closest to the area of conflict of an armed force's personnel and equipment, generally referring to maritime or land forces.  When a front (an intentional or unintentional boundary) between opposing sides form, the front line is the area where the armies are engaged in conflict, especially the line of contact between the opposing forces.  In a military conflict, then, when facing the front line, you face the enemy. All branches of the U. S.  armed services use the related technical terms, Forward Line of Own Troops (FLOT) and Forward Edge of Battle Area (FEBA). 

FIFA<====>11049<====>FIFA   The   (FIFA  ; French for "International Federation of Association Football") is an association which describes itself as an international governing body of association football, futsal, and beach soccer.  FIFA is responsible for the organization of football's major international tournaments, notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930 and the Women's World Cup which commenced in 1991. FIFA was founded in 1904 to oversee international competition among the national associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.  Headquartered in Zürich, its membership now comprises 211 national associations.  Member countries must each also be members of one of the six regional confederations into which the world is divided: Africa, Asia, Europe, North & Central America and the Caribbean, Oceania, and South America.

Fascism<====>11054<====>Fascism Fascism   is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism,   characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and control of industry and commerce  that came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I before it spread to other European countries.   Opposed to liberalism, Marxism and anarchism, fascism is usually placed on the far-right within the traditional left–right spectrum.  Fascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state and technology. 

Forge<====>11057<====>Forge   A forge is a type of hearth used for heating metals, or the workplace (smithy) where such a hearth is located.  The forge is used by the smith to heat a piece of metal to a temperature where it becomes easier to shape by forging, or to the point where work hardening no longer occurs.  The metal (known as the "workpiece") is transported to and from the forge using tongs, which are also used to hold the workpiece on the smithy's anvil while the smith works it with a hammer.  Sometimes, such as when hardening steel or cooling the work so that it may be handled with bare hands, the workpiece is transported to the slack tub, which rapidly cools the workpiece in a large body of water. 

Five Pillars of Islam<====>11059<====>Five Pillars of Islam   The Five Pillars of Islam (   ; also"pillars of the religion") are five basic acts in Islam, considered mandatory by believers and are the foundation of Muslim life.  They are summarized in the famous hadith of Gabriel.   The Shia, Ahmadiyya and Sunni agree on the essential details for the performance and practice of these acts,   but the Shia do not refer to them by the same name (see Ancillaries of the Faith, for the Twelvers, and Seven pillars of Ismailism). 

Friction<====>11062<====>Friction   Friction is the force resisting the relative motion of solid surfaces, fluid layers, and material elements sliding against each other.   There are several types of friction:Dry friction is a force that opposes the relative lateral motion of two solid surfaces in contact.  Dry friction is subdivided into static friction ("stiction") between non-moving surfaces, and kinetic friction between moving surfaces.  With the exception of atomic or molecular friction, dry friction generally arises from the interaction of surface features, known as asperitiesFluid friction describes the friction between layers of a viscous fluid that are moving relative to each other. 

February 7<====>11063<====>February 7Events457 – Leo I the Thracian becomes emperor of the Byzantine Empire. 1074 – Pandulf IV of Benevento is killed battling the invading Normans at the Battle of Montesarchio. 1301 – Edward of Caernarvon (later King Edward II of England) becomes the first English Prince of Wales. 1497 – The Bonfire of the Vanities occurs, during which supporters of Girolamo Savonarola burn cosmetics, art, and books in Florence, Italy. 1783 – American Revolutionary War: French and Spanish forces lift the Great Siege of Gibraltar. 1795 – The 11th Amendment to the United States Constitution is ratified. 

Faith<====>11064<====>Faith Faith is confidence or trust in a particular system of religious belief,  in which faith may equate to confidence based on some perceived degree of warrant.    According to Rudolf Bultmann, faith must be a determined vital act of will, not a culling and extolling of "ancient proofs". EtymologyThe English word faith is thought to date from 1200–1250, from the Middle English feith, via Anglo-French fed, Old French feid, feit from Latin fidem, accusative of fidēs (trust), akin to fīdere (to trust).    Stages of faith development James W.  Fowler (1940–2015) proposes a series of stages of faith-development (or spiritual development) across the human life-span.

Forest<====>11090<====>Forest    A forest is a large area dominated by trees.    Hundreds of more precise definitions of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing and ecological function.    According to the widely used   Food and Agriculture Organization definition, forests covered four billion hectares (15 million square miles) or approximately 30 percent of the world's land area in 2006.  Forests are the dominant terrestrial ecosystem of Earth, and are distributed across the globe.Forests account for 75% of the gross primary productivity of the Earth's biosphere, and contain 80% of the Earth's plant biomass. 

Finger Lakes<====>11092<====>Finger Lakes   The Finger Lakes is a group of 11 long, narrow, roughly north–south lakes in a region called the Finger Lakes region in Central New York, in the United States.  This region is defined as a bioregion and is a popular tourist destination. The lakes' shapes reminded early map-makers of human fingers, and the name stuck.  They are also characteristic glacial finger lakes.  Cayuga (435 feet deep, 133 m) and Seneca (618 feet, 188 m) Lakes are among the deepest in the United States, with bottoms well below sea level.   They are also the longest Finger Lakes, though neither's width exceeds 3. 

Kite<====>11100<====>Kite oaksA kite is traditionally a tethered heavier-than-air craft with wing surfaces that react against the air to create lift and drag.  A kite consists of wings, tethers, pulleys, and anchors.  Kites often have a bridle to guide the face of the kite at the correct angle so the wind can lift it.   A kite's wing also may be so designed so a bridle is not needed; when kiting a sailplane for launch, the tether meets the wing at a single point.  A kite may have fixed or moving anchors.  Untraditionally in technical kiting, a kite consists of tether-set-coupled wing sets; even in technical kiting, though, a wing in the system is still often called the kite. 

Fanzine<====>11101<====>FanzineA fanzine (blend of fan and magazine or -zine) is a non-professional and non-official publication produced by enthusiasts of a particular cultural phenomenon (such as a literary or musical genre) for the pleasure of others who share their interest.  The term was coined in an October 1940 science fiction fanzine by Russ Chauvenet and first popularized within science fiction fandom, and from there it was adopted by other communities. Typically, publishers, editors, writers and other contributors of articles or illustrations to fanzines are not paid.  Fanzines are traditionally circulated free of charge, or for a nominal cost to defray postage or production expenses. 

Forgotten Futures<====>11102<====>Forgotten Futures Forgotten Futures is a role-playing game created by Marcus Rowland to allow people to play in settings inspired by Victorian and Edwardian science fiction and fantasy (i. e. , steampunk).  Most of its releases begin with these stories then add background material to explain the settings (often as alternate worlds, whose history diverges from our own), adventures, and other game material. Game systemThe base system uses three characteristics (Body, Mind, and Soul) and a range of skills; points are used to purchase characteristics and skills based on one or more of the characteristics.  Skills and characteristics are used by opposing them to a target (such as a difficulty number, an opponent's skill or characteristics, etc. 

Fabritio Caroso<====>11103<====>Fabritio CarosoFabritio Caroso da Sermoneta (1526/1535 – 1605/1620) was an Italian Renaissance dancing master and a composer or transcriber of dance music. His dance manual Il Ballarino was published in 1581, with a subsequent edition, significantly different, Nobiltà di Dame, printed in 1600 and again after his death in 1630.  The work has been published in English as Courtly Dance of the Renaissance by Julia Sutton.  Both manuals have been printed in facsimile edition.   Many of the dances of Fabritio Caroso's manuals are meant for two dancers with a few for four or more dancers.   These manuals offer a great deal of information to dance historians and musicologists alike in that each description of a dance is accompanied by music examples with lute tablature and directions about how each music example is to be played. 

Fatah<====>11104<====>Fatah    Fataḥ (   ), formerly the Palestinian National Liberation Movement,    is a Palestinian nationalist political party and the largest faction of the confederated multi-party Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).

FAO is also a source of knowledge and information, and helps developing countries  in transition modernize and improve agriculture, forestry and fisheries practices, ensuring good nutrition and food security for all.  Its Latin motto,  , translates as "let there be bread". 

Félix Guattari<====>11109<====>Félix Guattari  Pierre-Félix Guattari (   ; April 30, 1930 – August 29, 1992) was a French psychotherapist, philosopher, semiologist, and activist.  He founded both schizoanalysis and ecosophy, and is best known for his intellectual collaborations with Gilles Deleuze, most notably Anti-Oedipus (1972) and A Thousand Plateaus (1980), the two volumes of Capitalism and Schizophrenia. BiographyClinic of La BordeGuattari was born in Villeneuve-les-Sablons, a working-class suburb of north-west Paris, France.   He trained under (and was analysed by) the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan in the early 1950s.  Subsequently, he worked all his life at the experimental psychiatric clinic of La Borde under the direction of Lacan's pupil, the psychiatrist Jean Oury. 

Filioque<====>11110<====>Filioque   Filioque ( ) is a Latin term added to the original Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed (commonly known as the Nicene Creed), and which has been the subject of great controversy between Eastern and Western Christianity.  The Latin term Filioque describes the Holy Spirit in Christianity as proceeding from both the Father and the Son, (and not from the Father only).   In the Nicene Creed it is translated by the English phrase "and   the Son" : who proceedeth from the Father  .  or in Latin: qui ex Patre    Whether that term Filioque is included, as well as how it is translated and understood, can have important implications for how one understands the central Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity. 

Federal Information Processing Standards<====>11113<====>Federal Information Processing StandardsFor the county code, see FIPS county code. Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are publicly announced standards developed by the United States federal government for use in computer systems by non-military government agencies and government contractors.    FIPS standards are issued to establish requirements for various purposes such as ensuring computer security and interoperability, and are intended for cases in which suitable industry standards do not already exist.   Many FIPS specifications are modified versions of standards used in the technical communities, such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). 

Fiqh<====>11114<====>FiqhFiqh ( ;    ) is Islamic jurisprudence.  Fiqh Encyclopædia Britannica   While sharia is believed by Muslims to represent divine law as revealed in the Quran and the Sunnah (the teachings and practices of the Islamic prophet Muhammad), fiqh is the human understanding of the sharia   —sharia expanded and developed by interpretation (ijtihad) of the Quran and Sunnah by Islamic jurists (ulama)  and implemented by the rulings (fatwa) of jurists on questions presented to them.  Thus conceptually, whereas sharia is considered immutable and infallible, fiqh is considered fallible and changeable. 

First Council of Nicaea<====>11118<====>First Council of Nicaea    The First Council of Nicaea ( ;    ) was a council of Christian bishops convened in the Bithynian city of Nicaea (now İznik, Bursa province, Turkey) by the Roman Emperor Constantine I in AD 325.  Constantine I organized the council along the lines of the Roman Senate and presided over it, but did not cast any official vote. This ecumenical council was the first effort to attain consensus in the Church through an assembly representing all of Christendom.  Hosius of Corduba, who was probably one of the Papal legates, may have presided over its deliberations.

Fornax<====>11123<====>Fornax  Fornax ( ) is a constellation in the southern sky, partly ringed by the celestial river Eridanus.  Its name is Latin for furnace.  It was named by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1756.  Fornax is one of the 88 modern constellations. The three brightest stars—Alpha, Beta and Nu Fornacis—form a flattened triangle facing south.  With an apparent magnitude of 3. 91, Alpha Fornacis is the brightest star in Fornax.  Six star systems have been found to have exoplanets. HistoryThe French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille first described the constellation in French as le Fourneau Chymique (the Chemical Furnace) with an alembic and receiver in his early catalogue,  before abbreviating it to le Fourneau on his planisphere in 1752,after he had observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the Cape of Good Hope.

Flamsteed designation<====>11129<====>Flamsteed designationA Flamsteed designation is a combination of a number and constellation name that uniquely identifies most naked eye stars in the modern constellations visible from southern England. DescriptionFlamsteed designations for stars are similar to Bayer designations, except that they use numbers instead of Greek and Roman letters.  Each star is assigned a number and the Latin genitive of the constellation it lies in (see 88 modern constellations for a list of constellations and the genitive forms of their names).  Flamsteed designations were assigned to 2554 stars.  The numbers were originally assigned in order of increasing right ascension within each constellation, but due to the effects of precession they are now slightly out of order in some places.

Northrop F-5<====>11142<====>Northrop F-5 The Northrop F-5A and F-5B Freedom Fighter and the F-5E and F-5F Tiger II are part of a supersonic light fighter family, initially designed in the late 1950s by Northrop Corporation.  Being smaller and simpler than contemporaries such as the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, the F-5 cost less to both procure and operate, making it a popular export aircraft.  The F-5 started life as a privately funded light fighter program by Northrop in the 1950s.  The design team wrapped a small, highly aerodynamic fighter around two compact and high-thrust General Electric J85 engines, focusing on performance and low cost of maintenance. 

Fresco<====>11144<====>Fresco  Fresco (plural frescos or frescoes) is a technique of mural painting executed upon freshly-laid, or wet lime plaster.  Water is used as the vehicle for the pigment to merge with the plaster, and with the setting of the plaster, the painting becomes an integral part of the wall.  The word fresco ( ) is derived from the Italian adjective fresco meaning "fresh", and may thus be contrasted with fresco-secco or secco mural painting techniques, which are applied to dried plaster, to supplement painting in fresco.  The fresco technique has been employed since antiquity and is closely associated with Italian Renaissance painting. 

Fire<====>11145<====>Fire    Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products.    Slower oxidative processes like rusting or digestion are not included by this definition. Fire is hot because the conversion of the weak double bond in molecular oxygen, O 2 , to the stronger bonds in the combustion products carbon dioxide and water releases energy (418 kJ per 32 g of O 2 ); the bond energies of the fuel play only a minor role here. At a certain point in the combustion reaction, called the ignition point, flames are produced. 

FIDE<====>11146<====>FIDE  The Fédération Internationale des Échecs or World Chess Federation  is an international organization that connects the various national chess federations around the world and acts as the governing body of international chess competition.

Fresnel equations<====>11149<====>Fresnel equations  The Fresnel equations (or Fresnel conditions), deduced by Augustin-Jean Fresnel ( ), describe the behaviour of light when moving between media of differing refractive indices.  The reflection of light that the equations predict is known as Fresnel reflection. OverviewWhen light moves from a medium of a given refractive index, n 1 , into a second medium with refractive index, n 2 , both reflection and refraction of the light may occur.  The Fresnel equations describe what fraction of the light is reflected and what fraction is refracted (i. e. , transmitted).  They also describe the phase shift of the reflected light. 

Figure skating<====>11152<====>Figure skating  Figure skating is a sport in which individuals, duos, or groups perform on figure skates on ice.  It was the first winter sport included in the Olympics, in 1908.   The four Olympic disciplines are men's singles, ladies' singles, pair skating and ice dancing.  Non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating and four skating.  From novice through senior-level competition, skaters generally perform two programs (short and long) which, depending on the discipline, may include spins, jumps, moves in the field, lifts, throw jumps, death spirals and other elements or moves. The blade has a groove on the bottom creating two distinct edges — inside and outside. 

Fudge (role-playing game system)<====>11157<====>Fudge (role-playing game system) Fudge is a generic role-playing game system for use in freeform role-playing games.    The name "FUDGE" was once an acronym for Freeform Universal Donated (later, Do-it-yourself) Gaming Engine  and, though the acronym has since been dropped, that phrase remains a good summation of the game's design goals.  Fudge has been nominated for an Origins Award for Best Role-Playing Game System for the Deryni Role-Playing Game.  Rather than being a rigidly pre-defined set of rules like d20 System or GURPS, Fudge offers a customizable toolkit for building the users' own specialized role-playing game system.

Functional analysis<====>11180<====>Functional analysis Functional analysis is a branch of mathematical analysis, the core of which is formed by the study of vector spaces endowed with some kind of limit-related structure (e. g.  inner product, norm, topology, etc. ) and the linear functions defined on these spaces and respecting these structures in a suitable sense.  The historical roots of functional analysis lie in the study of spaces of functions and the formulation of properties of transformations of functions such as the Fourier transform as transformations defining continuous, unitary etc.  operators between function spaces.   This point of view turned out to be particularly useful for the study of differential and integral equations.

Falsifiability<====>11283<====>FalsifiabilityStatements, hypotheses, or theories have falsifiability or refutability if there is the possibility of testing or observing it to showcase how false or how true it is.  They are falsifiable if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which could negate them and in the corollary, conceive of an observation or an argument which proves them.  Thus, the term falsifiability is synonymous to testability.  For example, the universal generalization that All swans are white is falsifiable since it is logically possible to falsify it by observing a single swan that is not white. 

Freikorps<====>11284<====>Freikorps  Freikorps ( , "Free Corps") were German volunteer units that existed from the 18th to the early 20th centuries, the members of which effectively fought as mercenaries, regardless of their own nationality.  In German-speaking countries, the first so-called Freikorps ("free regiments",  ) were formed in the 18th century from native volunteers, enemy renegades and deserters, and criminals.  These sometimes exotically equipped units served as infantry and cavalry (or more rarely as artillery), sometimes in just company strength, sometimes in formations up to several thousand strong; there were also various mixed formations or legions.  The Prussian von Kleist Freikorps included infantry, jäger, dragoons and hussars. 

Francisco I. Madero<====>11285<====>Francisco I.  Madero    Francisco Ignacio Madero González ( ; 30 October 1873 – 22 February 1913) was a Mexican revolutionary, writer and statesman who served as the 33rd president of Mexico from 1911 until his assassination in 1913. He was an advocate for social justice and democracy.  Madero was notable for challenging Mexican President Porfirio Díaz for the presidency in 1910 and being instrumental in sparking the Mexican Revolution.

Fruitarianism<====>11286<====>Fruitarianism  Fruitarianism ( ) is a diet that consists entirely or primarily of fruits in the botanical sense, and possibly nuts and seeds, without animal products.  Fruitarianism is a subset of dietary veganism. Fruitarianism may be adopted for different reasons, including ethical, religious, environmental, cultural, economic, and health reasons.  There are many varieties of the diet.  Some people whose diet consists of 75% or more fruit consider themselves fruitarians.  DefinitionsSome fruitarians will eat only what falls (or would fall) naturally from a plant: that is, foods that can be harvested without killing or harming the plant.

Felony<====>11293<====>Felony  The term felony, in some common law countries, means a bad crime.  The word originates from English common law (from the French medieval word "félonie"), where felonies were originally crimes that involved confiscation of a convicted person's land and goods.  Other crimes were called misdemeanors.  Many common law countries have now abolished the felony/misdemeanor distinction and replaced it with other distinctions, such as between indictable offences and summary offences.   A felony is generally considered a crime of high badness, while a misdemeanor is not. A person who has committed a felony is a felon, and upon conviction of a felony in a court of law a person is known as a convicted felon or a convict.

First aid<====>11296<====>First aid  First aid is the assistance given to any person suffering a sudden illness or injury,  with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery.   It includes initial intervention in a serious condition prior to professional medical help being available, such as performing CPR while awaiting an ambulance, as well as the complete treatment of minor conditions, such as applying a plaster to a cut.   First aid is generally performed by the layperson, with many people trained in providing basic levels of first aid, and others willing to do so from acquired knowledge. 

Feudalism<====>11298<====>Feudalism  Feudalism was a combination of legal and military customs in medieval Europe that flourished between the 9th and 15th centuries.  Broadly defined, it was a way of structuring society around relationships derived from the holding of land in exchange for service or labour. Although  derived from the Latin word feodum or feudum (fief),  then in use, the term feudalism and the system it describes were not conceived of as a formal political system by the people living in the Middle Ages.   In its classic definition, by François-Louis Ganshof (1944), François Louis Ganshof (1944). 

Fox<====>11299<====>Fox Foxes are small-to-medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae.  Foxes have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush). Twelve species belong to the monophyletic group of Vulpes genus of "true foxes".  Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.   Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. 

Foundationalism<====>11300<====>Foundationalism Foundationalism concerns philosophical theories of knowledge resting upon justified belief, or some secure foundation of certainty such as a conclusion inferred from a basis of sound premises.  Simon Blackburn, The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, 2nd (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005), p 139.   Its main rival is coherentism, whereby a body of knowledge, not requiring a secure foundation, can be established by the interlocking strength of its components, like a puzzle solved without prior certainty that each small region was solved correctly.  Identifying the alternatives as either circular reasoning or infinite regress, and thus exhibiting the regress problem, Aristotle made foundationalism his own clear choice, positing basic beliefs underpinning others. 

Felidae<====>11302<====>Felidae   The biological family Felidae is a lineage of carnivorans colloquially referred to as cats.  A member of this family is also called a felid.The term "cat" refers both to felids in general and specifically to domestic cats.  The characteristic features of cats have evolved to support a carnivorous lifestyle, with adaptations for ambush or stalking and short pursuit hunting.  They have gracile and muscular bodies, strong flexible forelimbs and retractable claws for holding prey, dental and cranial adaptations for a strong bite, and often have characteristic striped or spotted coat patterns for camouflage. 

Folklore<====>11303<====>Folklore Folklore is the expressive body of culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group.  These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes.  They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group.  Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations such as Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites.  Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact.  Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. 

Fusion cuisine<====>11304<====>Fusion cuisineFusion cuisine is cuisine that combines elements of different culinary traditions.  Cuisines of this type are not categorized according to any one particular cuisine style and have played a part in innovations of many contemporary restaurant cuisines since the 1970s.    Categories and typesFusion food is a general term for the combination of various forms of cookery and comes in several forms.  Regional fusion combines different cuisines of a region or sub-region.  Asian fusion restaurants, which combine the various cuisines of different Asian countries, have become popular in many parts of the United States and United Kingdom. 

Frame problem<====>11306<====>Frame problemIn artificial intelligence, the frame problem describes an issue with using first-order logic (FOL) to express facts about a robot in the world.  Representing the state of a robot with traditional FOL requires the use of many axioms that simply imply that things in the environment do not change arbitrarily.  For example, Hayes describes a "block world" with rules about stacking blocks together.  In a FOL system, additional axioms are required to make inferences about the environment (for example, that a block cannot change position unless it is physically moved).  The frame problem is the problem of finding adequate collections of axioms for a viable description of a robot environment. 

Frans Eemil Sillanpää<====>11307<====>Frans Eemil Sillanpää  Frans Eemil Sillanpää ( ) (16 September 1888 – 3 June 1964) was one of the most famous Finnish writers and in 1939 became the first Finnish writer to be awarded the Nobel Prize for literature "for his deep understanding of his country's peasantry and the exquisite art with which he has portrayed their way of life and their relationship with Nature".  Early lifeFrans Eemil Sillanpää was born into a peasant farming family in Hämeenkyrö.  Although his parents were poor, they managed to send him to school in Tampere.  At school Sillanpää was a good student and with aid of his benefactor Henrik Liljeroos he entered University of Helsinki in 1908 to study medicine.

First-order predicate<====>11344<====>First-order predicateIn mathematical logic, a first-order predicate is a predicate that takes only individual(s) constants or variables as argument(s).  Compare second-order predicate and higher-order predicate.This is not to be confused with a one-place predicate or monad, which is a predicate that takes only one argument. For example the expression "is a planet" is a one-place predicate, while the expression "is father of" is a two-place predicate.See alsoFirst-order predicate calculusMonadic predicate calculusReferences DEFAULTSORT 

Snap (gridiron football)<====>11345<====>Snap (gridiron football) A snap (colloquially called a "hike", "snapback", or "pass from center") is the backwards passing of the ball in American and Canadian football at the start of play from scrimmage. ActionThe ball begins on the ground with its long axis parallel to the sidelines of the field, its ends marking each team's line of scrimmage in American football; in Canadian football, the line of scrimmage of the team without the ball is 1 yard past their side of the ball.   The player snapping the ball (known officially as the "snapper" in rule books) delivers the ball to another player, and that action is the snap. 

FIFO (computing and electronics)<====>11347<====>FIFO (computing and electronics) FIFO is an acronym for first in, first out, a method for organizing and manipulating a data buffer, where the oldest (first) entry, or 'head' of the queue, is processed first.  It is analogous to processing a queue with first-come, first-served (FCFS) behaviour: where the people leave the queue in the order in which they arrive. FCFS is also the jargon term for the FIFO operating system scheduling algorithm, which gives every process central processing unit (CPU) time in the order in which it is demanded. FIFO's opposite is LIFO, last-in-first-out, where the youngest entry or 'top of the stack' is processed first. 

Firewall (construction)<====>11350<====>Firewall (construction)  A firewall is a fire-resistant barrier used to prevent the spread of fire for a prescribed period of time.  Firewalls are built between or through buildings, structures, electrical substation transformers, or within an aircraft or vehicle. ApplicationsFirewalls can be used to subdivide a building into separate fire areas and are constructed in accordance with the locally applicable building codes.  Firewalls are a portion of a building's passive fire protection systems. Firewalls can be used to separate-high value transformers at an electrical substation in the event of a mineral oil tank rupture and ignition.  The firewall serves as a fire containment wall between one oil-filled transformer and other neighboring transformers, building structures, and site equipment. 

Frigg<====>11353<====>Frigg  In Germanic mythology, Frigg (Old Norse), Frija (Old High German), Frea (Langobardic), and Frige (Old English) is a goddess.

The English weekday name Friday (etymologically Old English "Frīge's day") bears her name. Frigg is described as a goddess associated with foreknowledge and wisdom in Norse mythology, the northernmost branch of Germanic mythology and most extensively attested.  Frigg is the wife of the major god Odin and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir, is famous for her foreknowledge, is associated with the goddesses Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, and Gná, and is ambiguously associated with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity Jörð (Old Norse "Earth").

After World War II, Taglioni designed engines for Ceccato motorcycles and Mondial before joining Ducati in 1954.He began by designing Ducati's OHC four-stroke singles, and in 1963 designed the prototype V4 Ducati Apollo. 

Fourth-generation programming language<====>11367<====>Fourth-generation programming languageA fourth-generation programming language (4GL) is any computer programming language that belongs to a class of languages envisioned as an advancement upon third-generation programming languages (3GL).  Each of the programming language generations aims to provide a higher level of abstraction of the internal computer hardware details, making the language more programmer-friendly, powerful and versatile.   While the definition of 4GL has changed over time, it can be typified by operating more with large collections of information at once rather than focusing on just bits and bytes.   Languages claimed to be 4GL may include support for database management, report generation, mathematical optimization, GUI development, or web development. 

Frank Capra<====>11369<====>Frank Capra   Frank Russell Capra (born Francesco Rosario Capra; May 18, 1897 September 3, 1991) was an Italian-American film director, producer and writer who became the creative force behind some of the major award-winning films of the 1930s and 1940s.  Born in Italy and raised in Los Angeles from the age of five, his rags-to-riches story has led film historians such as Ian Freer to consider him the "American dream personified. " Freer 2009, pp.  40–41.  Capra became one of America's most influential directors during the 1930s, winning three Oscars from his six nominations as Best Director, along with three other Oscar wins from nine nominations in other categories.

The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War.  The current champion is Germany, which won its fourth title at the 2014 tournament in Brazil. The current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the World Cup Finals. 

Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus<====>11371<====>Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, surnamed Cunctator (  280 BC – 203 BC), was a Roman statesman and general of the third century BC.   He was consul five times (233, 228, 215, 214, and 209 BC) and was appointed dictator in 221 and 217 BC.   He was censor in 230 BC.  His agnomen, Cunctator, usually translated as "the delayer", refers to the strategy that he employed against Hannibal's forces during the Second Punic War.  Facing an outstanding commander with superior numbers, he pursued a then novel strategy of targeting the enemy's supply lines, and accepting only smaller engagements on favourable ground, rather than risking his entire army on direct confrontation with Hannibal himself. 

Floating-point arithmetic<====>11376<====>Floating-point arithmetic  In computing, floating-point arithmetic is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision.  For this reason, floating-point computation is often found in systems which include very small and very large real numbers, which require fast processing times.  A number is, in general, represented approximately to a fixed number of significant digits (the significand) and scaled using an exponent in some fixed base; the base for the scaling is normally two, ten, or sixteen.  A number that can be represented exactly is of the following form: \text{significand} \times \text{base}^\text{exponent}, where significand is an integer (i.

File manager<====>11382<====>File manager A file manager or file browser is a computer program that provides a user interface to manage files and folders.  The most common operations performed on files or groups of files include creating, opening (e. g.  viewing, playing, editing or printing), renaming, moving or copying, deleting and searching for files, as well as modifying file attributes, properties and file permissions.  Folders and files may be displayed in a hierarchical tree based on their directory structure.  Some file managers contain features inspired by web browsers, including forward and back navigational buttons. Some file managers provide network connectivity via protocols, such as FTP, NFS, SMB or WebDAV. 

File viewer<====>11385<====>File viewerA file viewer is an application software that presents the data stored in a computer file in a human-friendly form.  The file contents are generally displayed on the screen, or they may be printed.  Also, they may be read aloud using speech synthesis. OverviewFile viewers do not edit files, yet it is common for them to be able to export data in a different file format, or to copy information from the viewed to the system-wide clipboard.  A file viewer is limited-functionality software in the sense that it does not have a capability to create a file, or modify the content of an existing one. 

First Epistle of Peter<====>11387<====>First Epistle of Peter  The First Epistle of Peter, usually referred to simply as First Peter and often written 1 Peter, is a book of the New Testament.  The author presents himself as Peter the Apostle, and the epistle was traditionally held to have been written during his time as bishop of Rome or Bishop of Antioch, though neither title is used in the epistle.  The letter is addressed to various churches in Asia Minor suffering religious persecution. Authorship The authorship of 1 Peter has traditionally been attributed to the Apostle Peter because it bears his name and identifies him as its author (1:1). 

First Epistle of John<====>11388<====>First Epistle of John  The First Epistle of John, often referred to as First John and written 1 John, is the first of the Johannine epistles of the New Testament, and the fourth of the catholic epistles.  It is attributed to John the Evangelist, traditionally thought to be the author of the Gospel of John and the other two Johannine epistles.  This epistle was probably written in Ephesus in AD 95–110.   The work was written to counter docetism, which is the belief that Jesus did not come "in the flesh", but only as a spirit.  It also defined how Christians are to discern true teachers: by their ethics, their proclamation of Jesus in the flesh, and by their love. 

First Vatican Council<====>11390<====>First Vatican Council   The  Vatican Council ( ) was convoked by Pope Pius IX on 29 June 1868, after a period of planning and preparation that began on 6 December 1864.This, the twentieth ecumenical council of the Catholic Church, Encyclopædia Britannica: First Vatican Council  held three centuries after the Council of Trent, opened on 8 December 1869 and adjourned on 20 October 1870.   Unlike the five earlier General Councils held in Rome, which met in the Lateran Basilica and are known as Lateran Councils, it met in the Vatican Basilica, hence its name. 

First Council of the Lateran<====>11391<====>First Council of the Lateran  The Council of 1123 is reckoned in the series of Ecumenical councils by the Catholic Church.  It was convoked by Pope Callixtus II in December, 1122, immediately after the Concordat of Worms.  The Council sought to: (a) bring an end to the practice of the conferring of ecclesiastical benefices by people who were laymen; (b) free the election of bishops and abbots from secular influence; (c) clarify the separation of spiritual and temporal affairs; (d) re-establish the principle that spiritual authority resides solely in the Church; (e) abolish the claim of the emperors to influence papal elections. 

Four Noble Truths<====>11393<====>Four Noble Truths  The Four Noble Truths refer to and express the basic orientation of Buddhism  in a short expression:   we crave and cling to impermanent states and things,  which are dukkha,  "incapable of satisfying"  and painful.   This craving keeps us caught in samsara,  the endless cycle of repeated rebirth and dying again, and the dukkha that comes with it.   There is, however, a way to end this cycle,   namely by attaining nirvana, cessation of craving, whereafter rebirth and associated dukkha will no longer arise again. 

French Republican Calendar<====>11396<====>French Republican Calendar The French Republican Calendar ( ), also commonly called the French Revolutionary Calendar (calendrier révolutionnaire français), was a calendar created and implemented during the French Revolution, and used by the French government for about 12 years from late 1793 to 1805, and for 18 days by the Paris Commune in 1871.  The revolutionary system was designed in part to remove all religious and royalist influences from the calendar, and was part of a larger attempt at decimalisation in France (which also included decimal time of day, decimalisation of currency, and metrication). Overview and originsPrecursorSylvain Maréchal, prominent anticlerical atheist, published the first edition of his Almanach des Honnêtes-gens (Almanac of Honest People) in 1788. 

Freeman Dyson<====>11397<====>Freeman Dyson  Freeman John Dyson   (born 15 December 1923) is an English-born American theoretical physicist and mathematician.  He is known for his work in quantum electrodynamics, solid-state physics, astronomy and nuclear engineering.Freeman Dyson: Disturbing the universe, pg 131, "I had finally become an American . . .  The decision to abjure my allegiance to Queen Elizabeth might have been a difficult one, but the Queen's ministers made it easy for me. "  He theorized several concepts that bear his name, such as Dyson's transform, Dyson tree, Dyson series, and Dyson sphere. 

Fourth Council of the Lateran<====>11399<====>Fourth Council of the Lateran  The Fourth Council of the Lateran was convoked by Pope Innocent III with the papal bull Vineam domini Sabaoth of 19 April 1213, and the Council gathered at Rome's Lateran Palace beginning 11 November 1215.Due to the great length of time between the Council's convocation and meeting, many bishops had the opportunity to attend.  It is considered by the Catholic Church to have been the twelfth ecumenical council and is sometimes called the "Great Council" or "General Council of Lateran" due to the presence of seventy-one patriarchs and metropolitan bishops, four hundred and twelve bishops, and nine hundred abbots and priors together with representatives of several monarchs. 

Franconia<====>11401<====>Franconia   Franconia ( , also called Frankenland) is a region in Germany, characterised by its culture and language, and may be roughly associated with the areas in which the East Franconian dialect group, locally referred to as fränkisch, is spoken.It commonly refers to the eastern part of the historical Franconian stem duchy, mainly represented by the modern Bavarian administrative districts of Lower, Middle, and Upper Franconia, the adjacent northeastern parts of Heilbronn-Franken in Baden-Württemberg, parts of Thuringia south of the Rennsteig ridge, and small parts of Hesse.  Sometimes Vogtland is also regarded as part of Franconia (because the Vogtländisch dialect is often regarded as sub-group of East Franconian) but this is disputed. 

FileMan<====>11402<====>FileMan FileMan is a set of utilities written by George Timson in the late 1970s and early 1980s, using MUMPS, which provide a meta-data function for MUMPS applications.   The FileMan utilities allow the definition of data structures, menus and security, reports, and forms, allowing someone to set up applications without tremendous experience in the MUMPS programming language. FileMan was designed to support the complex information storage and processing needs of hospitals.   It was based on an active data dictionary that was able to invoke the full interpretive power of the MUMPS language from within a data reference. 

United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court<====>11404<====>United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court   The United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC, also called the FISA Court) is a U. S.  federal court established and authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) to oversee requests for surveillance warrants against foreign spies inside the United States by federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies.  Such requests are made most often by the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  Congress created FISA and its court as a result of the recommendations by the U. S.  Senate's Church Committee.

Female genital mutilation<====>11408<====>Female genital mutilationFemale genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital cutting and female circumcision, is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia.  The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common.  UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures.  Typically carried out by a traditional circumciser using a blade, FGM is conducted from days after birth to puberty and beyond. 

Forcemeat<====>11415<====>Forcemeat Forcemeat is a mixture of ground, lean meat mixed with fat by grinding, sieving, or puréeing the ingredients.   The result may either be smooth or coarse, depending on the desired consistency of the final product.   Forcemeats are used in the production of numerous items found in charcuterie, including quenelles, sausages, pâtés, terrines, roulades, and galantines.   Forcemeats are usually produced from raw meat, except in the case of a gratin.   Meats commonly used include pork, fish (pike, trout, or salmon), seafood, game meats (venison, boar, or rabbit), poultry, game birds, veal, and pork livers. 

Forseti<====>11417<====>ForsetiForseti (Old Norse "the presiding one," actually "president" in modern Icelandic and Faroese) is the god of justice and reconciliation in Norse mythology.  He is generally identified with Fosite, a god of the Frisians.  Jacob Grimm noted that if, as Adam of Bremen states, Fosite's sacred island was Heligoland, that would make him an ideal candidate for a deity known to both Frisians and Scandinavians, but that it is surprising he is never mentioned by Saxo Grammaticus.  Grimm took Forseti, "praeses", to be the older form of the name, first postulating an unattested Old High German equivalent *forasizo (cf.

Flag<====>11424<====>Flag  A flag is a piece of fabric (most often rectangular or quadrilateral) with a distinctive design that is used as a symbol, as a signaling device, or as decoration.  The term flag is also used to refer to the graphic design employed, and flags have since evolved into a general tool for rudimentary signalling and identification, especially in environments where communication is similarly challenging (such as the maritime environment where semaphore is used).  National flags are patriotic symbols with varied wide-ranging interpretations, often including strong military associations because of their original and ongoing military uses.  Flags are also used in messaging, advertising, or for other decorative purposes. 

Father Dougal McGuire<====>11425<====>Father Dougal McGuire Father Dougal McGuire is a character in the Channel 4 sitcom Father Ted.  Created by Arthur Mathews and Graham Linehan, Dougal was portrayed by comedian Ardal O'Hanlon for the programme's three series.  The character is a childlike, simple-minded Roman Catholic priest exiled to Craggy Island, a small island off the coast of Galway. Dougal originated as an unseen character in a short-lived stand-up routine performed by Mathews in the late 1980s.  Portraying an early version of Father Ted Crilly on-stage, Mathews occasionally discussed Dougal as one of Ted's great friends.  In 1994, the writers took Father Ted to television, casting O'Hanlon as the on-screen Dougal. 

Flores<====>11426<====>Flores   Flores (Indonesian: Pulau Flores) is one of the Lesser Sunda Islands, a group of islands in the eastern half of Indonesia.  The population was 1,831,000 in the 2010 census and the largest town is Maumere.  The name Flores is derived from the  Portuguese for "flowers". Flores is located east of Sumbawa and Komodo and west of Lembata and the Alor Archipelago.  To the southeast is Timor.  To the south, across the Sumba Strait, is Sumba island and to the north, beyond the Flores Sea, is Sulawesi. Among all islands containing Indonesian territory, Flores is the 10th most populous after Java, Sumatra, Borneo (Kalimantan), Sulawesi, New Guinea, Bali, Madura, Lombok, and Timor and also the 10th biggest island of Indonesia. 

First Punic War<====>11427<====>First Punic War   The First Punic War (264 to 241 BC) was the first of three wars fought between Ancient Carthage and the Roman Republic.  For more than 20 years, the two powers struggled for supremacy, primarily on the Mediterranean island of Sicily and its surrounding waters, and also in North Africa.  The war signalled the beginning of a strategic transformation in the western Mediterranean.   Carthage began the war as the great sea-power of the western Mediterranean, while Rome had but a small fleet of fighting ships.  Encyclopædia Britannica.  1911.  "Punic Wars. 

False document<====>11429<====>False document A false document is often promoted in conjunction with a criminal enterprise, such as fraud or a confidence game.  However, a false document is also a technique employed to create verisimilitude in a work of fiction.  By inventing and inserting documents that appear to be factual, an author tries to create a sense of authenticity beyond the normal and expected suspension of disbelief for a work of art.  The goal of a false document is to convince an audience that what is being presented is factual. In businessForged documents in business are typically for financial gain. 

Fernando Pessoa<====>11431<====>Fernando Pessoa  Fernando António Nogueira Pessoa ( ; June 13, 1888 – November 30, 1935), commonly known as Fernando Pessoa, was a Portuguese poet, writer, literary critic, translator, publisher and philosopher, described as one of the most significant literary figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest poets in the Portuguese language.  He also wrote in and translated from English and French. Pessoa was a prolific writer, and not only under his own name, for he dreamed up approximately seventy-five others.  He did not call them pseudonyms because he felt that did not capture their true independent intellectual life and instead called them heteronyms. 

Full moon<====>11432<====>Full moon  The full moon is the lunar phase when the Moon appears fully illuminated from Earth's perspective.  This occurs when Earth is located directly between the Sun and the Moon (more exactly, when the ecliptic longitudes of the Sun and Moon differ by 180°).  This means that the lunar hemisphere facing Earth – the near side – is completely sunlit and appears as a circular disk, while the far side is dark.  The full moon occurs once roughly every month. When the Moon moves into Earth's shadow, a lunar eclipse occurs, during which all or part of the Moon's face may appear reddish due to the Rayleigh scattering of blue wavelengths and the refraction of sunlight through Earth's atmosphere. 

Film format<====>11433<====>Film format A film format is a technical definition of a set of standard characteristics regarding image capture on photographic film, for either stills or filmmaking.  It can also apply to projected film, either slides or movies.  The primary characteristic of a film format is its size and shape. In the case of motion picture film, the format may also include audio parameters (though often not).  Other characteristics usually include the film gauge, pulldown method, lens anamorphosis (or lack thereof), and film gate or projector aperture dimensions, all of which need to be defined for photography as well as projection, as they may differ. 

Faster-than-light<====>11439<====>Faster-than-light Faster-than-light (also superluminal or FTL) communication and travel refer to the propagation of information or matter faster than the speed of light. The special theory of relativity implies that only particles with zero rest mass may travel at the speed of light.  Tachyons, particles whose speed exceeds that of light, have been hypothesized but the existence of such particles would violate causality and the consensus of physicists is that such particles cannot exist. On the other hand, what some physicists refer to as "apparent" or "effective" FTL   depends on the hypothesis that unusually distorted regions of spacetime might permit matter to reach distant locations in less time than light could in normal or undistorted spacetime.

It uses a store-and-forward system to exchange private (email) and public (forum) messages between the BBSes in the network, as well as other files and protocols in some cases.The FidoNet system was based on a number of small interacting programs. Only one of these interacted with the BBS system directly and was the only portion that had to be ported to support other BBS software. This greatly eased porting, and FidoNet was one of the few networks that was widely supported by almost all BBS software, as well as a number of non-BBS online services. This modular construction also allowed FidoNet to easily upgrade to new data compression systems, which was important in an era using modem-based communications over telephone links with high long-distance calling charges.The rapid improvement in modem speeds during the early 1990s, combined with the rapid decrease in price of computer systems and storage, made BBSes increasingly popular. By the mid-1990s there were almost 40,000 FidoNet systems in operation, and it was possible to communicate with millions of users around the world. Only UUCPNET came close in terms of breadth or numbers; FidoNet's user base far surpassed other networks like BITNET. The broad availability of low-cost Internet connections starting in the mid-1990s lessened the need for FidoNet's store-and-forward system, as any system in the world could be reached for equal cost. Direct dialing into local BBS systems rapidly declined. The availability of internet connectivity is by no means universal, and although FidoNet has shrunk considerably since the early 1990s, it remains in use around the world.HistoryOriginsThere are two major accounts of the development of the FidoNet, differing only in small details.Tom Jennings' accountAround Christmas 1983, Tom Jennings started work on a new MS-DOS–hosted bulletin board system that would emerge as Fido BBS. Jennings set up the system in San Francisco some time in early 1984. Another early user was John Madil, who was trying to set up a similar system in Baltimore on his Rainbow 100. Fido started spreading to new systems, and Jennings eventually started keeping an informal list of their phone numbers, with Jennings becoming #1 and Madil #2. Ben Baker, "Fidonet History", 2 May 1987 Jennings released the first version of the FidoNet software in June 1984. In early 1985 he wrote a document explaining the operations of the FidoNet, along with a short portion on the history of the system. In this version, FidoNet was developed as a way to exchange mail between the first two Fido BBS systems, Jennings' and Madil's, to "see if it could be done, merely for the fun of it". This was first supported in Fido V7, "sometime in June 84 or so". Tom Jennings, "FidoNet History and Operation", February 1985  Jason Scott Sadofsky, "BBS: The Documentary", FIDONET Episode, 21 May 2005.    Ben Baker's accountIn early 1984, Ben Baker was planning on starting a BBS for the newly forming computer club at the McDonnell Douglas automotive division in St. Louis. Baker was part of the CP/M special interest group within the club.  He intended to use the seminal, CP/M-hosted, CBBS system, and went looking for a machine to run it on. The club's president told Baker that DEC would be giving them a Rainbow 100 computer on indefinite loan, so he made plans to move the CBBS onto this machine. The Rainbow contained two processors, an Intel 8088 and a Zilog Z80, allowing it to run both MS-DOS and CP/M, with the BBS running on the latter. When the machine arrived, they learned that the Z80 side had no access to the I/O ports, so CBBS could not communicate with a modem. While searching for software that would run on the MS-DOS side of the system, Baker learned of Fido through Madil. The Fido software required changes to the serial drivers to work properly on the Rainbow. A porting effort started, involving Jennings, Madil and Baker. This caused all involved to rack up considerable long distance charges as they all called each other during development, or called into each other's BBSes to leave email. During one such call "in May or early June", Baker and Jennings discussed how great it would be if the BBS systems could call each other automatically, exchanging mail and files between them.  This would allow them to compose mail on their local machines, and then deliver it quickly, as opposed to calling in and typing the message in while on a long-distance telephone connection. Jennings responded by calling into Baker's system that night and uploading a new version of the software consisting of three files: FIDO_DECV6 (the new version of the BBS program itself), FIDONET, and NODELIST.BBS. The new version of FIDO BBS had a timer that caused it to exit at a specified time, normally at night, and as it exited it would run the separate FIDONET program. NODELIST was the list of Fido BBS systems, which Jennings had already been compiling. The FIDONET program was what later became known as a mailer. FIDO was modified to use a previously unused numeric field in the message headers to store a node number for the machine the message should be delivered to. When FIDONET ran, it would search through the email database for any messages with a number in this field. FIDONET collected all of the messages for a particular node number into a file known as a message packet. After all the packets were generated, one for each node, the FIDONET program would look up the destination node's phone number in NODELIST.BBS, and call the remote system. Provided that FIDONET was running on that system, the two systems would handshake and, if this succeeded, the calling system would upload its packet, download a return packet if there was one, and disconnect. FIDONET would then unpack the return packet, place the received messages into the local system's storage, and move onto the next packet. When there were no remaining packet, it would exit, and run the FIDO BBS program. In order to lower long distance charges, the mail exchanges were timed to run late at night, normally 4 AM.  This would later be known as national mail hour,  and, later still, as Zone Mail Hour.Up and runningBy June 1984 Version 7 of the system was being run in production, and nodes were rapidly being added to the network. By August there were almost 30 systems in the nodelist, 50 by September, and over 160 by January 1985. As the network grew, the maintenance of the nodelist became prohibitive, and errors were common. In these cases people would start receiving phone calls at 4 AM, from a caller that would say nothing and then hang up. In other cases the system would be listed before it was up and running, resulting long distance calls that accomplished nothing. In August 1984 Jennings handed off control of the nodelist to the group in St. Louis, mostly Ken Kaplan and Ben Baker. Kaplan had come across Fido as part of finding a BBS solution for his company, which worked with DEC computers and had been given a Rainbow computer and a USRobotics 1200bit/s modem.  From then on, joining FidoNet required one to set up their system and use it to deliver a netmail message to a special system, Node 51. The message contained various required contact information. If this message was transmitted successfully, it ensured that at least some of the system was working properly. The nodelist team would then reply with another netmail message back to the system in question, containing the assigned node number. If delivery succeeded, the system was considered to be working properly, and it was added to the nodelist.  The first new nodelist was published on 21 September 1984. Nets and nodesGrowth continued to accelerate, and by the spring of 1985 the system was already reaching its limit of 250 nodes. In addition to the limits on growth of what was clearly a popular system, nodelist maintenance continued to grow more and more time consuming. It was also realized that Fido systems were generally clustered – of the 15 systems running by the start of June 1984, 5 of them were in St. Louis.   A user on Jennings's system in San Francisco that addressed emails to different systems in St. Louis would cause calls to be made to each of those BBSes in turn.  Local calls were normally free or charged at a low rate.  Additionally, the initial call setup, generally the first minute of the call, was normally billed at a higher rate than continuing an existing connection. Therefore, it would make sense to deliver all the messages from all the users in San Francisco to all of the users in St. Louis in a single call. Packets were generally small enough to be delivered within a minute or two, so delivering all the messages in a single call could greatly reduce costs by avoiding multiple first-minute charges. Once delivered, the packet would be broken out into separate packets for local systems, and delivered using multiple local free calls.The team settled on the concept of adding a new network number patterned on the idea of area codes. Details of the sequence of events leading to the new routing scheme differ slightly between accounts.  A complete network address would now consist of the network and node number pair, which would be written with a slash between them. All mail travelling between networks would first be sent to their local network host, someone who volunteered to pay for any long distance charges. That single site would collect up all the netmail from all of the systems in their network, then re-package it into single packets destined to each network. They would then call any required network admin sites and deliver the packet to them. That site would then process the mail as normal, although all of the messages in the packet would be guaranteed to be local calls. The network address was placed in an unused field in the Fido message database, which formerly always held a zero. Systems running existing versions of the software already ignored the fields containing the new addressing, so they would continue to work as before; when noticing a message addressed to another node they would look it up and call that system. Newer systems would recognize the network number and instead deliver that message to the network host. To ensure backward compatibility, existing systems retained their original node numbers through this period. A huge advantage of the new scheme was that node numbers were now unique only within their network, not globally. This meant the previous 250 node limit was gone, but for a variety of reasons this was initially limited to about 1,200. This change also devolved the maintenance of the nodelists down to the network hosts, who then sent updated lists back to Node 51 to be collected into the master list. The St. Louis group now had to only maintain their own local network, and do basic work to compile the global list. At a meeting held in Kaplan's living room in St. Louis on 11 April 1985 In the interviews, Baker says this took place in May.  the various parties hammered out all of the details of the new concept. As part of this meeting, they also added the concept of a region, a purely administrative level that was not part of the addressing scheme. Regional hosts would handle any stragglers in the network maps, remote systems that had no local network hosts. They then divided up the US into ten regions that they felt would have roughly equal populations. By May, Jennings had early versions of the new software running. These early versions specified the routing manually through a new ROUTE.BBS file that listed network hosts for each node. For instance, an operator might want to forward all mail to St. Louis through a single node, node 10. ROUTE.BBS would then include a list of all the known systems in that area, with instructions to forward mail to each of those nodes through node 10. This process was later semi-automated by John Warren's NODELIST program. Tom Jennings, "FidoNet History #2", 20 August 1985  Over time, this information was folded into updated versions of the nodelist format, and the ROUTES file is no longer used. A new version of FIDO and FIDONET, 10C, was released containing all of these features. On 12 June 1985 the core group brought up 10C, and most Fido systems had upgraded within a few months.  The process went much smoother than anyone imagined, and very few nodes had any problems. EchomailSome time during the evolution of Fido, file attachments were added to the system, allowing a file to be referenced from an email message. During the normal exchange between two instances of FIDONET, any files attached to the messages in the packets were delivered after the packet itself had been up or downloaded. It is not clear when this was added, but it was already a feature of the basic system when the 8 February 1985 version of the FidoNet standards document was released, so this was added very early in Fido's history.At a sysop meeting in Dallas, the idea was raised that it would be nice if there was some way for the sysops to post messages that would be shared among the systems. Wynn Wagner, "History of Echomail", July 1985  In February 1986 Jeff Rush, one of the group members, introduced a new mailer that extracted messages from public forums that the sysop selected, in a manner similar to the way the original mailer handled private messages. The new program was known as a tosser/scanner. The tosser produced a file that was similar (or identical) to the output from the normal netmail scan, however, these files were then compressed and attached to a normal netmail message as an attachment. This message was then sent to a special address on the remote system. After receiving netmail as normal, the scanner on the remote system looked for these messages, unpacked them, and put them into the same public forum on the original system. Randy Bush, "FidoNet: Technology, Use, Tools, and History", 1992 In this fashion, Rush's system implemented a store and forward public message system similar to Usenet, but based on, and hosted by, the FidoNet system. The first such echomail forum was one created by the Dallas area sysops to discuss business, known as SYSOP. Another called TECH soon followed. Several public echos soon followed, including GAYNET and CLANG. These spawned hundreds of new echos, and led to the creation of the Echomail Conference List (Echolist) by Thomas Kenny in January 1987. Frank Robbins, "FidoNet History Timeline"  Echomail produced world-spanning shared forums, and its traffic volume quickly surpassed the original netmail system. By the early 1990s, echo mail was carrying over 8 MB of compressed message traffic a day, many times that when uncompressed. Echomail did not necessarily use the same distribution pathways as normal netmail, and the distribution routing was stored in a separate setup file not unlike the original ROUTES.BBS. At the originating site a header line was added to the message indicating the origin system's name and address. After that, each system that the message traveled through added itself to a growing PATH header, as well as a SEENBY header. SEENBY prevented the message from looping around the network in the case of mis-configured routing information. Echomail was not the only system to use the file attachment feature of netmail to implement store-and-forward capabilities. Similar concepts were used by online games and other systems as well.Zones and pointsThe evolution towards the net/node addressing scheme was also useful for reducing communications costs between continents, where timezone differences on either end of the connection might also come into play. For instance, the best time to forward mail in the US was at night, but that might not be the best time for European hosts to exchange. Efforts towards introducing a continental level to the addressing system started in 1986. At the same time, it was noted that some power users were interested in using FidoNet protocols as a way of delivering the large quantities of echomail to their local machines where it could be read offline. These users did not want their systems to appear in the nodelist - they did not (necessarily) run a bulletin board system and were not publicly accessible.  A mechanism allowing netmail delivery to these systems without the overhead of nodelist maintenance was desirable.In October 1986 the last major change to the FidoNet network was released, adding zones and points. Zones represented major geographical areas roughly corresponding to continents. There were six zones in total, North America, South America, Europe, Oceania, Asia, and Africa. Points represented non-public nodes, which were created privately on a BBS system. Point mail was delivered to a selected host BBS as normal, but then re-packaged into a packet for the point to pick up on-demand. The complete addressing format was now  zone:net/node.point , so a real example might be  Bob Smith@1:250/250.10 .  Points were widely used only for a short time, the introduction of offline reader systems filled this role with systems that were much easier to use. Points remain in use to this day, but are less popular than when they were introduced.Other extensionsAlthough FidoNet supported file attachments from even the earliest standards, this feature tended to be rarely used and was often turned off. File attachments followed the normal mail routing through multiple systems, and could back up transfers all along the line as the files were copied. A solution was offered in the form of file requests, which made file transfers driven by the calling system and used one-time point-to-point connections instead of the traditional routing. Two such standards became common, "WaZOO" and "Bark", which saw varying support among different mailers. Both worked in a similar fashion, with the mailer calling the remote system and sending a new handshake packet to request the files.  Although FidoNet was, by far, the best known BBS-based network, it was by no means the only one. From 1988 on, PCBoard systems were able to host similar functionality known as RelayNet, while other popular networks included RBBSNet from the Commodore 64 world, and AlterNet. Late in the evolution of the FidoNet system, there was a proposal to allow mail (but not forum messages) from these systems to switch into the FidoNet structure.  This was not adopted, and the rapid rise of the internet made this superfluous as these networks rapidly added internet exchange, which acted as a lingua franca.Fight-o-net, peak and declineFidoNet started in 1984 and listed 100 nodes by the end of that year. Steady growth continued through the 1980s, but a combination of factors led to rapid growth after 1988. These included faster and less expensive modems, and rapidly declining costs of hard drives and computer systems in general. By April 1993 the FidoNet nodelist contained over 20,000 systems. At that time it was estimated that each node had, on average, about 200 active users. Of these 4 million users in total, 2 million users commonly used echomail, the shared public forums, while about 200,000 used the private netmail system.  At its peak, FidoNet listed approximately 39,000 systems.  The Jargon File puts it at 38,000 at its peak. Throughout its lifetime, FidoNet was beset with management problems and infighting. Much of this can be traced to the fact that the inter-net delivery cost real money, and the traffic grew more rapidly than decreases caused by improving modem speeds and downward trending long distance rates. As they increased, various methods of recouping the costs were attempted, all of which caused friction in the groups. The problems were so bad that Jennings came to refer to the system as the "fight-o-net". As modems reached speeds of 28.8 kbit/s, the overhead of the TCP/IP protocols were no longer so egregious and dial-up Internet became increasingly common. By 1995 the bulletin board market was reeling as users abandoned local BBS systems in favour of larger sites and web pages, which could be accessed worldwide for the same cost as accessing a local BBS system. This also made FidoNet less expensive to implement, because inter-net transfers could be delivered over the Internet as well, at little or no marginal cost. But this seriously diluted the entire purpose of the store-and-forward model, which had been built up specifically to address a long-distance problem that no longer existed.The FidoNet nodelist started shrinking, especially in areas with widespread availability of internet connections. This downward trend continues, but has levelled out at approximately 2,500 nodes. The exact number can be determined by examining the official nodelist. However, the format is difficult to parse and many systems deliberately appear more than once, in different sections. The 2,500 node limit is an estimate made by the current maintainer as of 2013, Janis Kracht.  FidoNet remains popular in areas where Internet access is difficult to come by, or expensive.There is now (~2014) a retro movement which is resulting in a slow increase in internet connected BBS and nodes. Telnet, Rlogin, and SSH are being used between systems. This means you can telnet to many BBS worldwide as cheaply as ones next door. Also Usenet and internet mail has been added, along with long file names to many newer versions of BBS software, some being free-ware, resulting in increasing use. The deaf and blind are also able to access this better than the internet as a whole as interfaces for them deal mostly with ASCII text which exists in most BBS. They find it helps them communicate without the complications of pictures and audio in their internet mail and communication in general. Nodelists are no longer declining in all cases.FidoNet organizational structureFidoNet is governed in a hierarchical structure according to FidoNet policy, with designated coordinators at each level to manage the administration of FidoNet nodes and resolve disputes between members.  Network coordinators are responsible for managing the individual nodes within their area, usually a city or similar sized area. Regional coordinators are responsible for managing the administration of the network coordinators within their region, typically the size of a state, or small country. Zone coordinators are responsible for managing the administration of all of the regions within their zone. The world is divided into six zones, the coordinators of which elect one of themselves to be the International Coordinator of FidoNet.Technical structureFidoNet was historically designed to use modem-based dial-up (POTS) access between bulletin board systems, and much of its policy and structure reflected this.The FidoNet system officially referred only to transfer of Netmail—the individual private messages between people using bulletin boards—including the protocols and standards with which to support it. A netmail message would contain the name of the person sending, the name of the intended recipient, and the respective FidoNet addresses of each. The FidoNet system was responsible for routing the message from one system to the other (details below), with the bulletin board software on each end being responsible for ensuring that only the intended recipient could read it. Due to the hobbyist nature of the network, any privacy between sender and recipient was only the result of politeness from the owners of the FidoNet systems involved in the mail's transfer. It was common, however, for system operators to reserve the right to review the content of mail that passed through their system.Netmail allowed for the attachment of a single file to every message. This led to a series of piggyback protocols that built additional features onto FidoNet by passing information back and forth as file attachments. These included the automated distribution of files, and transmission of data for inter-BBS games.By far the most commonly used of these piggyback protocols was Echomail, public discussions similar to Usenet newsgroups in nature. Echomail was supported by a variety of software that collected up new messages from the local BBSes' public forums (the scanner), compressed it using ARC or ZIP, attached the resulting archive to a Netmail message, and sent that message to a selected system. On receiving such a message, identified because it was addressed to a particular user, the reverse process was used to extract the messages, and a tosser put them back into the new system's forums.Echomail was so popular that for many users, Echomail was the FidoNet. Private person-to-person Netmail was relatively rare.Geographical structureFidoNet is politically organized into a tree structure, with different parts of the tree electing their respective coordinators. The FidoNet hierarchy consists of zones, regions, networks, nodes and points broken down more-or-less geographically.The highest level is the zone, which is largely continent-based:Zone 1 is North AmericaZone 2 is Europe, Former Soviet Union countries, and IsraelZone 3 is AustralasiaZone 4 is Latin America (except Puerto Rico)Zone 5 is AfricaZone 6 is Asia  Israel and the Asian parts of Russia, (which are listed in Zone 2). On 26 July 2007 zone 6 was removed, and all remaining nodes were moved to zone 3. Each zone is broken down into regions, which are broken down into nets, which consist of individual nodes.  Zones 7-4095 are used for othernets; groupings of nodes which use Fido-compatible software to carry their own independent message areas without being in any way controlled by FidoNet's political structure. Using un-used zone numbers would ensure that each network would have a unique set of addresses, avoiding potential routing conflicts and ambiguities for systems that belonged to more than one network.FidoNet addressesFidoNet addresses explicitly consist of a zone number, a network number (or region number), and a node number. They are written in the form  Zone:Network/Node .  The FidoNet structure also allows for semantic designation of region, host, and hub status for particular nodes, but this status is not directly indicated by the main address.For example, consider a node located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States with an assigned node number is 918, located in Zone 1 (North America), Region 19, and Network 170. The full FidoNet address for this system would be  1:170/918 .  The region was used for administrative purposes, and was only part of the address if the node was listed directly underneath the Regional Coordinator, rather than one of the networks that were used to divide the region further.FidoNet policy requires that each FidoNet system maintain a nodelist of every other member system. Information on each node includes the name of the system or BBS, the name of the node operator, the geographic location, the telephone number, and software capabilities. The nodelist is updated weekly, to avoid unwanted calls to nodes that had shut down, with their phone numbers possibly having been reassigned for voice use by the respective telephone company.To accomplish regular updates, coordinators of each network maintain the list of systems in their local areas. The lists are forwarded back to the International Coordinator via automated systems on a regular basis. The International Coordinator would then compile a new nodelist, and generate the list of changes (nodediff) to be distributed for node operators to apply to their existing nodelist.Routing of FidoNet mailIn a theoretical situation, a node would normally forward messages to a hub. The hub, acting as a distribution point for mail, might then send the message to the Net Coordinator. From there it may be sent through a Regional Coordinator, or to some other system specifically set up for the function. Mail to other zones might be sent through a Zone Gate.For example, a FidoNet message might follow the path:1:170/918 (node) to 1:170/900 (hub) to 1:170/0 (net coordinator) to 1:19/0 (region coordinator) to 1:1/0 (zone coordinator). From there, it was distributed 'down stream' to the destination node(s).Originally there was no specific relationship between network numbers and the regions they reside in. In some areas of FidoNet, most notably in Zone 2, the relationship between region number and network number are entwined. For example, 2:201/329 is in Net 201 which is in Region 20 while 2:2410/330 is in Net 2410 which is in Region 24. Zone 2 also relates the node number to the hub number if the network is large enough to contain any hubs. This effect may be seen in the nodelist by looking at the structure of Net 2410 where node 2:2410/330 is listed under Hub 300. This is not the case in other zones.In Zone 1, things are much different. Zone 1 was the starting point and when Zones and Regions were formed, the existing nets were divided up regionally with no set formula. The only consideration taken was where they were located geographically in respect to the region's mapped outline. As net numbers got added, the following formula was used. Region number × 20 Then when some regions started running out of network numbers, the following was also used. Region number × 200 Region 19, for instance, contains nets 380-399 and 3800-3999 in addition to those that were in Region 19 when it was formed.Part of the objective behind the formation of local nets was to implement cost reduction plans by which all messages would be sent to one or more hubs or hosts in compressed form (ARC was nominally standard, but PKZIP is universally supported); one toll call could then be made during off-peak hours to exchange entire message-filled archives with an out-of-town uplink for further redistribution.In practice, the FidoNet structure allows for any node to connect directly to any other, and node operators would sometimes form their own toll-calling arrangements on an ad-hoc basis, allowing for a balance between collective cost saving and timely delivery. For instance, if one node operator in a network offered to make regular toll calls to a particular system elsewhere, other operators might arrange to forward all of their mail destined for the remote system, and those near it, to the local volunteer.  Operators within individual networks would sometimes have cost-sharing arrangements, but it was also common for people to volunteer to pay for regular toll calls either out of generosity, or to build their status in the community.This ad-hoc system was particularly popular with networks that were built on top of FidoNet. Echomail, for instance, often involved relatively large file transfers due to its popularity. If official FidoNet distributors refused to transfer Echomail due to additional toll charges, other node operators would sometimes volunteer. In such cases, Echomail messages would be routed to the volunteers' systems instead.The FidoNet system was best adapted to an environment in which local telephone service was inexpensive and long-distance calls (or intercity data transfer via packet-switched networks) costly. Therefore, it fared somewhat poorly in Japan, where even local lines are expensive, or in France, where tolls on local calls and competition with Minitel or other data networks limited its growth.PointsAs the number of messages in Echomail grew over time, it became very difficult for users to keep up with the volume while logged into their local BBS. Points were introduced to address this, allowing technically savvy users to receive the already compressed and batched Echomail (and Netmail) and read it locally on their own machines.  To do this, the FidoNet addressing scheme was extended with the addition of a final address segment, the point number. For instance, a user on the example system above might be given point number 10, and thus could be sent mail at the address  1:170/918.10 .In real-world use, points are fairly difficult to set up. The FidoNet software typically consisted of a number of small utility programs run by manually edited scripts that required some level of technical ability. Reading and editing the mail required either a "sysop editor" program, or a BBS program to be run locally.In North America (Zone 1), where local calls are generally free, the benefits of the system were offset by its complexity. Points were used only briefly, and even then only to a limited degree. Dedicated offline mail reader programs such as Blue Wave, Squiggy and Silver Xpress (OPX) were introduced in the mid-1990s, and quickly rendered the point system obsolete. Many of these packages supported the QWK offline mail standard.In other parts of the world, especially Europe, this was different. In Europe, even local calls are generally metered, so there was a strong incentive to keep the duration of the calls as short as possible. Point software employs standard compression (ZIP, ARJ, etc.) and so keeps the calls down to a few minutes a day at most. In contrast to North America, pointing saw rapid and fairly widespread uptake in Europe.Many regions distribute a pointlist in parallel with the nodelist. The pointlist segments are maintained by Net- and Region Pointlist Keepers and the Zone Point List Keeper assembles them into the Zone pointlist. At the peak of FidoNet there were over 120,000 points listed in the Zone 2 pointlist. Listing points is on a voluntary basis and not every point is listed, so how many points there really were is anybody's guess. As of June 2006, there are still some 50,000 listed points. Most of them are in Russia and Ukraine.Technical specificationsFidoNet contained several technical specifications for compatibility between systems.  The most basic of all is FTS-0001, with which all FidoNet systems are required to comply as a minimal requirement.  FTS-0001 defined:Handshaking - the protocols used by mailer software to identify each other and exchange meta information about the session.Transfer protocol (XMODEM) - the protocols to be used for transferring files containing FidoNet mail between systems.Message format - the standard format for FidoNet messages during the time which they were exchanged between systems.Other specifications that were commonly used provided for echomail, different transfer protocols and handshake methods (e.g.: Yoohoo/Yoohoo2u2, EMSI), file compression, nodelist format, transfer over reliable connections such as the Internet (Binkp), and other aspects.Zone mail hourSince computer bulletin boards historically used the same telephone lines for transferring mail as were used for dial-in human users of the BBS, FidoNet policy dictates that at least one designated line of each FidoNet node must be available for accepting mail from other FidoNet nodes during a particular hour of each day. Zone Mail Hour, as it was named, varies depending on the geographic location of the node, and was designated to occur during the early morning.  The exact hour varies depending on the time zone, and any node with only one telephone line is required to reject human callers. In practice, particularly in later times, most FidoNet systems tend to accept mail at any time of day when the phone line is not busy, usually during night.FidoNet deployments Most FidoNet deployments were designed in a modular fashion.  A typical deployment would involve several applications that would communicate through shared files and directories, and switch between each other through carefully designed scripts or batch files.  However,   software that encompassed all required functions in one package is available, such as D'Bridge.  Such software eliminated the need for custom batch files and is tightly integrated in operation.  The preference of deployment was that of the operator and there were both pros and cons of running in either fashion.Arguably the most important piece of software on a DOS-based Fido system was the FOSSIL driver, which was a small device driver which provided a standard way for the Fido software to talk to the modem.   This driver needed to be loaded before any Fido software would work.  An efficient FOSSIL driver meant faster, more reliable connections.Mailer software was responsible for transferring files and messages between systems, as well as passing control to other applications, such as the BBS software, at appropriate times.  The mailer would initially answer the phone and, if necessary, deal with incoming mail via FidoNet transfer protocols.  If the mailer answered the phone and a human caller was detected rather than other mailer software, the mailer would exit, and pass control to the BBS software, which would then initialise for interaction with the user.  When outgoing mail was waiting on the local system, the mailer software would attempt to send it from time to time by dialing and connecting to other systems who would accept and route the mail further.  Due to the costs of toll calls which often varied between peak and off-peak times, mailer software would usually allow its operator to configure the optimal times in which to attempt to send mail to other systems.BBS software was used to interact with human callers to the system.  BBS software would allow dial-in users to use the system's message bases and write mail to others, locally or on other BBSes.  Mail directed to other BBSes would later be routed and sent by the mailer, usually after the user had finished using the system.  Many BBSes also allowed users to exchange files, play games, and interact with other users in a variety of ways (i.e.: node to node chat).A scanner/tosser application, such as FastEcho, FMail, TosScan and Squish, would normally be invoked when a BBS user had entered a new FidoNet message that needed to be sent, or when a mailer had received new mail to be imported into the local messages bases.  This application would be responsible for handling the packaging of incoming and outgoing mail, moving it between the local system's message bases and the mailer's inbound and outbound directories.  The scanner/tosser application would generally be responsible for basic routing information, determining which systems to forward mail to.In later times, message readers or editors that were independent of BBS software were also developed.  Often the System Operator of a particular BBS would use a devoted message reader, rather than the BBS software itself, to read and write FidoNet and related messages. One of the most popular editors in 2008 was GoldED+.  In some cases FidoNet nodes, or more often FidoNet points, had no public bulletin board attached, and existed only for the transfer of mail for the benefit of the node's operator. Most nodes in 2009 had no BBS access, but only points, if anything.The original Fido BBS software, and some other FidoNet-supporting software from the 1980s, is no longer functional on modern systems.  This is for several reasons, including problems related to the Y2K bug.  In some cases, the original authors have left the BBS or shareware community, and the software, much of which was closed source, has been rendered abandonware.Several DOS based legacy FidoNet Mailers such as FrontDoor, Intermail, MainDoor and D'Bridge from the early 1990s can still be run today under Windows without a modem, by using the freeware NetFoss Telnet FOSSIL driver, and by using a Virtual Modem such as NetSerial. This allows the mailer to dial an IP address or hostname via Telnet, rather than dialing a real POTS phone number. There are similar solutions for Linux such as MODEMU (modem emulator) which has limited success when combined with DOSEMU (DOS emulator).Mail Tossers such as FastEcho and FMail are still used today under both Windows and Linux/DOSEMU.There are several modern Windows based FidoNet Mailers available today with source code, including Argus, Radius, and Taurus . MainDoor is another Windows based Fidonet mailer, which also can be run using either a modem or directly over TCP/IP. Two popular free and open source software FidoNet mailers for Unix-like systems are the binkd (cross-platform, IP-only, uses the binkp protocol) and qico (supports modem communication as well as the IP protocol of ifcico and binkp).On the hardware side, Fido systems were usually well-equipped machines, for their day, with quick CPUs, high-speed modems and 16550 UARTs, which were at the time an upgrade.  As a Fidonet system was usually a BBS, it needed to quickly process any new mail events before returning to its 'waiting for call' state. In addition, the BBS itself usually necessitated lots of storage space.  Finally, a FidoNet system usually had at least one dedicated phoneline.  Consequently, operating a Fidonet system often required significant financial investment, a cost usually met by the owner of the system.FidoNet availabilityWhile the use of FidoNet has dropped dramatically compared with its use up to the mid-1990s, it is still used in many countries and especially Russia and former republics of the USSR.   Some BBSes, including those that are now available for users with Internet connections via telnet, also retain their FidoNet netmail and echomail feeds.Some of FidoNet's echomail conferences are available via gateways with the Usenet news hierarchy using software like UFGate.  There are also mail gates for exchanging messages between Internet and FidoNet.  Widespread net abuse and e-mail spam on the Internet side has caused some gateways (such as the former 1:1/31 IEEE fidonet.org gateway) to become unusable or cease operation entirely.FidoNewsFidoNews is the newsletter of the FidoNet community.  Affectionately nicknamed The Snooze, it is published weekly.  It was first published in 1984.  Throughout its history, it has been published by various people and entities, including the short-lived International FidoNet Association.See alsoFsxNetFruity DogPODSnetRelayNetUUCPReferencesNotes Citations Further reading    External links  Alternate FidoNet Home PageFidoNet Technical Standards Committee Home PageFidoNews, the weekly newsletter of the FidoNet communityInternational Echolist Home PageIFDC FileGate ProjectFidonet Showcase Project   DEFAULTSORT

Fatherland<====>11445<====>Fatherland Fatherland is the nation of one's "fathers", "forefathers" or "ancestors".  It can be viewed as a nationalist concept, insofar as it is evocative of emotions related to family ties and links them to national identity and patriotism, but in the English language it can also simply mean the country of one's birth or origin.  It can be compared to motherland and homeland, and some languages will use more than one of these terms.The national anthem of the Netherlands between 1815 and 1932, "Wien Neêrlands Bloed", makes extensive use of the parallel Dutch word. 

Flag of the United States<====>11447<====>Flag of the United States    The flag of the United States of America, often referred to as the American flag, is the national flag of the United States.  It  consists of thirteen equal horizontal stripes of red (top and bottom) alternating with white, with a blue rectangle in the canton (referred to specifically as the "union") bearing fifty small, white, five-pointed stars arranged in nine offset horizontal rows, where rows of six stars (top and bottom) alternate with rows of five stars.  The 50 stars on the flag represent the 50 states of the United States of America, and the 13 stripes represent the thirteen British colonies that declared independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and became the first states in the U. 

Federated States of Micronesia<====>11448<====>Federated States of Micronesia  The Federated States of Micronesia ( ; abbreviated FSM and also known simply as Micronesia) is an independent sovereign island nation and a United States associated state consisting of four states  from west to east, Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei and Kosrae that are spread across the Western Pacific Ocean.  Together, the states comprise around 607 islands (a combined land area of approximately  ) that cover a longitudinal distance of almost   just north of the equator.  They lie northeast of New Guinea, south of Guam and the Marianas, west of Nauru and the Marshall Islands, east of Palau and the Philippines, about   north of eastern Australia and some   southwest of the main islands of Hawaii. 

Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg<====>11449<====>Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg   Frederick William ( ) (16 February 1620 – 29 April 1688) was Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia, thus ruler of Brandenburg-Prussia, from 1640 until his death in 1688.  A member of the House of Hohenzollern, he is popularly known as "the Great Elector"  ( ) because of his military and political achievements.   Frederick William was a staunch pillar of the Calvinist faith, associated with the rising commercial class.  He saw the importance of trade and promoted it vigorously.  His shrewd domestic reforms gave Prussia a strong position in the post-Westphalian political order of north-central Europe, setting Prussia up for elevation from duchy to kingdom, achieved under his son and successor. 

Frederick V<====>11454<====>Frederick VFrederick V or Friedrich V may refer to: Frederick V, Burgrave of Nuremberg (c. 1333–1398), German nobleFrederick V of Austria (1415–1493), or Frederick III, Holy Roman EmperorFrederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1460–1536), or Friedrich V, Margrave von Brandenburg-Ansbach-BayreuthFrederick V, Elector Palatine (1596–1632), or Friedrich V von der PfalzFrederick V of Denmark (1723–1766), king of Denmark and Norway 

French horn<====>11456<====>French horn   The French horn (since the 1930s known simply as the "horn" in some professional music circles) is a brass instrument made of tubing wrapped into a coil with a flared bell.  The double horn in F/B  (technically a variety of German horn) is the horn most often used by players in professional orchestras and bands.  A musician who plays any kind of horn is generally referred to as a horn player (or less frequently, a hornist). Pitch is controlled through the combination of the following factors: speed of propulsion of air through the instrument (controlled by the player's lungs and thoracic diaphragm); diameter and tension of lip aperture (controlled by the player's lip muscles—the embouchure) in the mouthpiece; plus, in a modern French horn, the operation of valves by the left hand, which route the air into extra sections of tubing. 

Fra Angelico<====>11457<====>Fra Angelico   Fra Angelico (born Guido di Pietro;    February 18, 1455) was an Early Italian Renaissance painter described by Vasari in his Lives of the Artists as having "a rare and perfect talent".  Giorgio Vasari, Lives of the Artists.  Penguin Classics, 1965.  He was known to contemporaries as Fra Giovanni da Fiesole (Brother John of Fiesole) and Fra Giovanni Angelico (Angelic Brother John).  In modern Italian he is called il Beato Angelico (Blessed Angelic One);  the common English name Fra Angelico means the "Angelic friar". In 1982, Pope John Paul II proclaimed his beatification    in recognition of the holiness of his life, thereby making the title of "Blessed" official. 

Fra Bartolomeo<====>11458<====>Fra BartolomeoFra Bartolomeo or Bartolommeo OP (March 28, 1472 – October 31, 1517), also known as Bartolommeo di Pagholo,  Bartolommeo di S.  Marco,  and his original name Baccio della Porta,  was an Italian Renaissance painter of religious subjects.   He spent all his career in Florence until his mid-forties, when he travelled to work in various cities, as far south as Rome.   He trained with Cosimo Roselli and in the 1490s fell under the influence of Savonarola, which led him to become a Dominican friar in 1500, renouncing painting for several years. He was instructed to resume painting for the benefit of his order in 1504, and now developed an idealized High Renaissance style, seen in his Vision of St Bernard of that year, now in poor condition but whose "figures and drapery move with a seraphic grace that must have struck the young Raphael with the force of revelation". 

Frédéric Bazille<====>11459<====>Frédéric Bazille Jean Frédéric Bazille (December 6, 1841 – November 28, 1870) was a French Impressionist painter.  Many of Bazille's major works are examples of figure painting in which he placed the subject figure within a landscape painted en plein air.    Life and workFrédéric Bazille was born in Montpellier, Hérault, Languedoc-Roussillon, France, into a wealthy Protestant family.  He became interested in painting after seeing some works of Eugène Delacroix.  His family agreed to let him study painting, but only if he also studied medicine.  Bazille began studying medicine in 1859, and moved to Paris in 1862 to continue his studies. 

Ford Madox Brown<====>11460<====>Ford Madox Brown   Ford Madox Brown (16 April 1821 – 6 October 1893) was a French-born British painter of moral and historical subjects, notable for his distinctively graphic and often Hogarthian version of the Pre-Raphaelite style.  Arguably, his most notable painting was Work (1852–65).  Brown spent the latter years of his life painting the Manchester Murals, depicting Mancunian history, for Manchester Town Hall. Early lifeBrown was the grandson of the medical theorist John Brown, founder of the Brunonian system of medicine.  His great grandfather was a Scottish labourer.   His father Ford Brown served as a purser in the Royal Navy, including a period serving under Sir Isaac Coffin and a period on HMS Arethusa. 

Francis Crick<====>11461<====>Francis Crick   Francis Harry Compton Crick  (8 June 1916 – 28 July 2004) was a British molecular biologist, biophysicist, and neuroscientist, most noted for being a co-discoverer of the structure of the DNA molecule in 1953 with James Watson, work which was based partly on fundamental studies done by Rosalind Franklin, Raymond Gosling and Maurice Wilkins.  Together with Watson and Maurice Wilkins, he was jointly awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material". 

Francis van Aarssens<====>11463<====>Francis van Aarssens  Baron Francis van Aarssens or  Baron François van Aerssen (27 September 1572 - 27 December 1641), from 1611 on lord of Sommelsdijk, was a diplomat and statesman of the United Provinces. BiographyHe was born in Brussels, the son of Cornelis van Aarsens, also a statesman.  His talents commended him to the notice of Advocate Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, who sent him, at the age of 26 years, as a diplomatic agent of the states-general to the court of  France.   He took a considerable part in the negotiations of the Twelve Years' Truce in 1609. 

Frigate<====>11464<====>Frigate   A frigate   is any of several types of warship, the term having been used for ships of various sizes and roles over the last few centuries. In the 17th century, this term was used for any warship built for speed and maneuverability, the description often used being "frigate-built".  These could be warships carrying their principal batteries of carriage-mounted guns on a single deck or on two decks (with further smaller carriage-mounted guns usually carried on the forecastle and quarterdeck of the vessel).  The term was generally used for ships too small to stand in the line of battle, although early line-of-battle ships were frequently referred to as frigates when they were built for speed. 

Francisco Franco<====>11466<====>Francisco FrancoFrancisco Franco Bahamonde  ( ;   ;  4 December 1892 – 20 November 1975) was a Spanish general who ruled over Spain as a military dictator from 1939, after the Nationalist victory in the Spanish Civil War, until his death in 1975.  Payne (2000), p.  67  This period in Spanish history is commonly known as Francoist Spain. As a conservative and a monarchist, Franco opposed the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a socialist secular republic in 1931.  With the 1936 elections, the conservative Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Right-wing Groups lost by a narrow margin, and the leftist Popular Front came to power. 

Flash Crowd<====>11467<====>Flash Crowd  "Flash Crowd" is a 1973 English language novella by science fiction author Larry Niven,    one of a series about the social consequence of inventing an instant, practically free transfer booth.  One consequence not foreseen by the builders of the system was that with the almost immediate reporting of newsworthy events, tens of thousands of people worldwide — along with criminals — would teleport to the scene of anything interesting, thus creating disorder and confusion.  The plot centers around a television journalist who, after being fired for his inadvertent role in inciting a post-robbery riot in Los Angeles, seeks to independently investigate the teleportation system for the flaws in its design allowing for such spontaneous riots to occur. 

August Kekulé<====>11469<====>August Kekulé  Friedrich August Kekulé, later Friedrich August Kekule von Stradonitz ( ; 7 September 1829 – 13 July 1896), was a German organic chemist.   From the 1850s until his death, Kekulé was one of the most prominent chemists in Europe, especially in theoretical chemistry.   He was the principal founder of the theory of chemical structure. NameKekulé never used his first given name; he was known throughout his life as August Kekulé.  After he was ennobled by the Kaiser in 1895, he adopted the name August Kekule von Stradonitz, without the French acute accent over the second "e". 

Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor<====>11472<====>Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III (21 September 1415 – 19 August 1493), called the Peaceful or the Fat, was Holy Roman Emperor  from 1452 until his death, the first emperor of the House of Habsburg.  He was the penultimate emperor to be crowned by the Pope, and the last to be crowned in Rome. Prior to his imperial coronation, he was duke of the Inner Austrian lands of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola from 1424, and also acted as regent over the Duchy of Austria (as Frederick V) from 1439.  He was elected and crowned King of Germany (as Frederick IV) in 1440. 

Fuerteventura<====>11475<====>Fuerteventura  Fuerteventura ( ; literally meaning "strong fortune" but translated by some as "Strong Winds" or a corruption of the French term for "Great Adventure")   is one of the Canary Islands, in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa, politically part of Spain.  At  , it is the second largest of the Canary Islands, after Tenerife.  It was declared a biosphere reserve by UNESCO in May 2009.  Its capital is Puerto del Rosario. HistoryPrecolonial historyThe first settlers of Fuerteventura are believed to have come from North Africa.  The word Mahorero (Majorero) or Maho is still used today to describe the people of Fuerteventura and is derived from the ancient word 'mahos', a type of goatskin shoe worn by these original inhabitants. 

Fairmount, Indiana<====>11476<====>Fairmount, Indiana  Fairmount is a town in Fairmount Township, Grant County in the east central part of the U. S.  state of Indiana.  The population was 2,954 at the 2010 census.   It is ninety kilometers (fifty-five miles) northeast of Indianapolis.  Largely a bedroom community to its three thousand citizens, Fairmount is best known as the boyhood home of actor James Dean, who is buried there. GeographyFairmount is located at   (40. 417702, −85. 648942).    According to the 2010 census, Fairmount has a total area of  , all land.    Demographics 2010 censusAs of the census    of 2010, there were 2,954 people, 1,241 households, and 837 families residing in the town. 

Free verse<====>11478<====>Free verse   Free verse is an open form of poetry.  It does not use consistent meter patterns, rhyme, or any other musical pattern.  Many poems composed in free verse thus tend to follow the rhythm of natural speech.  PrefacePoets have explained that free verse is not totally free; 'its only freedom is from the tyrant demands of the metered line'.   Free verse displays some elements of form.  Most free verse self-evidently continues to observe a convention of the poetic line in some sense, at least in written representations, though retaining a potential degree of linkage. 

F. W. de Klerk<====>11479<====>F.  W.  de Klerk    Frederik Willem de Klerk DMS ( ; born 18 March 1936) is a South African politician who served as State President of South Africa from 1989 to 1994 and as Deputy President from 1994 to 1996.  South Africa's last head of state from the era of white-minority rule, his government focused on dismantling the apartheid system and introducing universal suffrage.  Ideologically a conservative and an economic liberal, he led the National Party from 1989 to 1997. Born in Johannesburg, British South Africa, to an influential Afrikaner family, de Klerk joined the Broederbond while at university. 

Furlong<====>11488<====>Furlong    A furlong is a measure of distance in imperial units and U. S.  customary units equal to one-eighth of a mile, equivalent to 660 feet, 220 yards, 40 rods, or 10 chains. Using the international definition of the inch as exactly 25. 4 millimetres, one furlong is 201. 168 metres.  However, the United States does not uniformly use this conversion ratio.  Older ratios are in use for surveying purposes in some states, leading to variations in the length of the furlong of about two parts per million, or 0. 4 millimetres (  inch). 

Fundamental frequency<====>11490<====>Fundamental frequencyThe fundamental frequency, often referred to simply as the fundamental, is defined as the lowest frequency of a periodic waveform.  In music, the fundamental is the musical pitch of a note that is perceived as the lowest partial present.  In terms of a superposition of sinusoids (e. g.  Fourier series), the fundamental frequency is the lowest frequency sinusoidal in the sum.   In some contexts, the fundamental is usually abbreviated as f 0  (or FF), indicating the lowest frequency counting from zero.In other contexts, it is more common to abbreviate it as f 1 , the first harmonic. 

Fable<====>11491<====>Fable Fable is a literary genre:  a succinct fictional story, in prose or verse, that features animals, legendary creatures, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature that are anthropomorphized (given human qualities, such as the ability to speak human language) and that illustrates or leads to a particular moral lesson (a "moral"), which may at the end be added explicitly as a pithy maxim. A fable differs from a parable in that the latter excludes animals, plants, inanimate objects, and forces of nature as actors that assume speech or other powers of humankind. Usage has not always been so clearly distinguished. 

Foot<====>11492<====>Foot    The foot (plural feet) is an anatomical structure found in many vertebrates.  It is the terminal portion of a limb which bears weight and allows locomotion.  In many animals with feet, the foot is a separate organ at the terminal part of the leg made up of one or more segments or bones, generally including claws or nails. EtymologyThe word "foot", in the sense of meaning the "terminal part of the leg of a vertebrate animal" comes from "Old English fot "foot," from Proto-Germanic *fot (source also of Old Frisian fot, Old Saxon fot, Old Norse fotr, Danish fod, Swedish fot, Dutch voet, Old High German fuoz, German Fuß, Gothic fotus "foot"), from PIE root *ped- "foot. 

Fallout shelter<====>11493<====>Fallout shelter   A fallout shelter is an enclosed space specially designed to protect occupants from radioactive debris or fallout resulting from a nuclear explosion.  Many such shelters were constructed as civil defense measures during the Cold War. During a nuclear explosion, matter vaporized in the resulting fireball is exposed to neutrons from the explosion, absorbs them, and becomes radioactive.  When this material condenses in the rain, it forms dust and light sandy materials that resemble ground pumice.  The fallout emits alpha and beta particles, as well as gamma rays. Much of this highly radioactive material falls to earth, subjecting anything within the line of sight to radiation, becoming a significant hazard. 

History of the Federated States of Micronesia<====>11494<====>History of the Federated States of MicronesiaThe Federated States of Micronesia are located on the Caroline Islands in the western Pacific Ocean.  The history of the modern Federated States of Micronesia is one of settlement by Micronesians; colonization by Spain, Germany, and Japan; United Nations trusteeship under United States-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands; and gradual independence beginning with the ratification of a sovereign constitution in 1979. Pre-colonial historyThe ancestors of the Micronesians settled there over 4,000 years ago.  A decentralized chieftain-based system eventually evolved into a more centralized economic and religious culture centered on Yap and Pohnpei. 

Politics of the Federated States of Micronesia<====>11495<====>Politics of the Federated States of Micronesia The politics of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) takes place in a framework of a federal representative democratic republic.  The President of the Federated States of Micronesia is both head of state and head of government.  Executive power is exercised by the president and his cabinet, while legislative power is vested in both the president and the Congress.  The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The internal workings of the Micronesia are governed by the 1979 constitution, which guarantees fundamental human rights and establishes a separation of governmental powers. 

Geography of the Federated States of Micronesia<====>11496<====>Geography of the Federated States of Micronesia Geography of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), a country located in the western Pacific Ocean, and in the Micronesia cultural and ecological sub-region of Oceania. Geography The country consists of 607 islands extending   across the Caroline Islands Archipelago.  They are east of the Philippine Islands, and north of the island of New Guinea.  The federal capital is Palikir, on Pohnpei island. The 607 islands are grouped into four states, and east to west are: Yap StateChuuk State  — before 1990 named Truk. Pohnpei State  — before 1985 named Ponape. 

Demographics of the Federated States of Micronesia<====>11497<====>Demographics of the Federated States of MicronesiaThis article is about the demographic features of the population of the Federated States of Micronesia, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population. The Demographics of the Federated States of Micronesia refers to the population characteristics of people who inhabit the Federated States of Micronesia.   The indigenous population of the Federated States of Micronesia, which is predominantly Micronesian, consists of various ethnolinguistic groups.  English has become the common language.  Population growth remains high at more than 3%, but is ameliorated somewhat by net emigration. 

Economy of the Federated States of Micronesia<====>11498<====>Economy of the Federated States of Micronesia The economic activity of the Federated States of Micronesia consists primarily of subsistence agriculture and fishing.  The islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting, except for high-grade phosphate.  The potential for a tourist industry exists, but the remoteness of the location and a lack of adequate facilities hinder development.  Financial assistance from the US is the primary source of revenue, with the US pledged to spend $1. 3 billion in the islands in 1986-2001.  Geographical isolation and a poorly developed infrastructure are major impediments to long-term growth. Under the terms of the Compact of Free Association, the United States provided FSM with around $2 billion in grants and services from 1986 to 2001.

Foreign relations of the Federated States of Micronesia<====>11503<====>Foreign relations of the Federated States of Micronesia The government of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) conducts its own foreign relations. Since independence in 1986, the FSM has established diplomatic relations with a number of nations, including most of its Pacific neighbors. Regional relationsRegional cooperation through various multilateral organizations is a key element in FSM's foreign policy.  FSM is a full member of the Pacific Islands Forum, the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission,  the Pacific Regional Environment Programme and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community.  The country also is one of the eight signatories of the Nauru Agreement Concerning Cooperation In The Management Of Fisheries Of Common Interest which collectively controls 25-30% of the world's tuna supply and approximately 60% of the western and central Pacific tuna supply. 

Fandom<====>11504<====>Fandom    Fandom is a subculture composed of fans characterized by a feeling of empathy and camaraderie with others who share a common interest.  Fans typically are interested in even minor details of the object(s) of their fandom and spend a significant portion of their time and energy involved with their interest, often as a part of a social network with particular practices (a fandom); this is what differentiates "fannish" (fandom-affiliated) fans from those with only a casual interest. A fandom can grow around any area of human interest or activity.  The subject of fan interest can be narrowly defined, focused on something like an individual celebrity, or more widely defined, encompassing entire hobbies, genres or fashions. 

Fort Collins, Colorado<====>11507<====>Fort Collins, Colorado   Fort Collins is the Home Rule Municipality that is the county seat    and the most populous municipality of Larimer County, Colorado, United States. Situated on the Cache La Poudre River along the Colorado Front Range, Fort Collins is located 65 miles (105 km) north of the Colorado State Capitol in Denver.  With a 2016 estimated population of 161,000,  it is the fourth most populous city in Colorado after Denver, Colorado Springs, and Aurora.  Fort Collins is a midsize college city, home to Colorado State University. 

Francis Drake<====>11508<====>Francis Drake  Sir Francis Drake (  – 28 January 1596 ) was an English sea captain, slave trader, and privateer of the Elizabethan era.  Drake carried out the second circumnavigation of the world in a single expedition, from 1577 to 1580, and was the first to complete the voyage as captain while leading the expedition throughout the entire circumnavigation.  With his incursion into the Pacific Ocean, he claimed what is now California for the English and inaugurated an era of conflict with the Spanish on the western coast of the Americas,    an area that had previously been largely unexplored by western shipping. 

Fast Fourier transform<====>11512<====>Fast Fourier transform A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm that samples a signal over a period of time (or space) and divides it into its frequency components.   These components are single sinusoidal oscillations at distinct frequencies each with their own amplitude and phase.  This transformation is illustrated in Diagram 1.  Over the time period measured, the signal contains 3 distinct dominant frequencies.  An FFT algorithm computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence, or its inverse (IFFT).  Fourier analysis converts a signal from its original domain to a representation in the frequency domain and vice versa. 

Fort William, Highland<====>11513<====>Fort William, Highland Fort William (    "The Garrison") is the second largest settlement in the Highlands of Scotland with around 10,000 inhabitants – and the largest town: only the city of Inverness is larger. Fort William is a major tourist centre, with Glen Coe just to the south,   to the east and Glenfinnan to the west, on the Road to the Isles.  It is a centre for hillwalking and climbing due to its proximity to Ben Nevis and many other Munro mountains.  It is also known for its nearby downhill mountain bike track. 

Glossary of French expressions in English<====>11515<====>Glossary of French expressions in English Around 45%    of English vocabulary is of French origin, most coming from the Anglo-Norman spoken by the upper classes in England for several hundred years after the Norman Conquest, before the language settled into what became Modern English.  Thoroughly English words of French origin, such as art, competition, force, machine, money, police, publicity, role, routine and table, are pronounced according to English rules of phonology, rather than French, and are commonly used by English speakers without any consciousness of their French origin. This article, on the other hand, covers French words and phrases that have entered the English lexicon without ever losing their character as Gallicisms: they remain unmistakably "French" to an English speaker. 

Financial rand<====>11516<====>Financial randThe South African financial rand was the most visible part of a system of capital controls.  Although the financial rand was abolished in March 1995, some capital controls remain in place.  These capital controls are locally referred to as "exchange controls", although the system has since 1995 moved towards surveillance —  recording and reporting to the authorities of foreign currency transactions — rather than control. Capital controls have been in place in South Africa in various guises on an uninterrupted basis since the outbreak of World War II, when Great Britain and its dominions implemented the Sterling area. 

List of FIPS country codes<====>11517<====>List of FIPS country codesThis is a list of FIPS 10-4 country codes for Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions. The two-letter country codes were used by the US government for geographical data processing in many publications, such as the CIA World Factbook.  The standard is also known as DAFIF 0413 ed 7 Amdt.  No.  3 (Nov 2003) and as DIA 65-18 (Defense Intelligence Agency, 1994, "Geopolitical Data Elements and Related Features"). The FIPS standard includes both the codes for independent countries (similar but sometimes incompatible with the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard) and the codes for top-level subdivision of the countries (similar to but usually incompatible with the ISO 3166-2 standard). 

Fair Isle<====>11519<====>Fair Isle    Fair Isle ( ;  ) is an island in Shetland, in northern Scotland.  It lies approximately halfway between mainland Shetland and Orkney.  It is known for its bird observatory and a traditional style of knitting. Geography  the most remote inhabited island in the United Kingdom.   It is administratively part of the parish of Dunrossness, Shetland, and is roughly equidistant from Sumburgh Head some   to the northeast on the Mainland of Shetland   and North Ronaldsay, Orkney, some   to the southwest.   Fair Isle is   long and   wide. 

Four Feather Falls<====>11520<====>Four Feather Falls Four Feather Falls was the third puppet TV show produced by Gerry Anderson for  Granada Television.  It was based on an idea by Barry Gray, who also wrote the show's music.   The series was the first to use an early version of Anderson's Supermarionation puppetry.  Thirty-nine 13-minute episodes were produced, broadcast by Granada from February until November 1960.  The setting is the late 19th-century fictional Kansas town of Four Feather Falls, where the hero of the series, Tex Tucker, is a sheriff.  The four feathers of the title refers to four magical feathers given to Tex by the Indian chief Kalamakooya as a reward for saving his grandson: two allowed Tex's guns to swivel and fire without being touched whenever he was in danger, and two conferred the power of speech on Tex's horse and dog. 

Fly-by-wire<====>11522<====>Fly-by-wire  Fly-by-wire (FBW) is a system that replaces the conventional manual flight controls of an aircraft with an electronic interface.  The movements of flight controls are converted to electronic signals transmitted by wires (hence the fly-by-wire term), and flight control computers determine how to move the actuators at each control surface to provide the ordered response.  The fly-by-wire system also allows automatic signals sent by the aircraft's computers to perform functions without the pilot's input, as in systems that automatically help stabilize the aircraft, or prevent unsafe operation of the aircraft outside its performance envelope.  Crane, Dale: Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition, page 224. 

Falklands War<====>11523<====>Falklands War  The Falklands War ( ), also known as the Falklands Conflict, Falklands Crisis, South Atlantic Conflict, and the Guerra del Atlántico Sur (Spanish for "South Atlantic War"), was a ten-week war between Argentina and the United Kingdom over two British overseas territories in the South Atlantic: the Falkland Islands, and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.  It began on Friday, 2 April 1982, when Argentina invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands (and, the following day, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands) in an attempt to establish the sovereignty it had claimed over them.  On 5 April, the British government dispatched a naval task force to engage the Argentine Navy and Air Force before making an amphibious assault on the islands. 

Fahrenheit<====>11524<====>Fahrenheit  The Fahrenheit scale is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by Amsterdam-based physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686–1736).   It uses the degree Fahrenheit (symbol: °F) as the unit.  Several accounts of how he originally defined his scale exist.  The lower defining point, 0 °F, was established as the temperature of a solution of brine made from equal parts of ice and salt.  Further limits were established as the melting point of ice (32 °F) and his best estimate of the average human body temperature (96 °F, about 2. 6 °F less than the modern value due to a later redefinition of the scale). 

Florence<====>11525<====>Florence   Florence (   ;    )  is the capital city of the Italian region of Tuscany.  It is the most populous city in Tuscany, with 383,083 inhabitants in 2013, and over 1,520,000 in its metropolitan area.  Florence was a centre of medieval European trade and finance and one of the wealthiest cities of that era.   It is considered the birthplace of the Renaissance, and has been called "the Athens of the Middle Ages".   A turbulent political history includes periods of rule by the powerful Medici family and numerous religious and republican revolutions. 

Quotient group<====>11526<====>Quotient group A quotient group or factor group is a mathematical group obtained by aggregating similar elements of a larger group using an equivalence relation that preserves the group structure.   For example, the cyclic group of addition modulo n can be obtained from the integers by identifying elements that differ by a multiple of n and defining a group structure that operates on each such class (known as a congruence class) as a single entity.  It is part of the mathematical field known as group theory. In a quotient of a group, the equivalence class of the identity element is always a normal subgroup of the original group, and the other equivalence classes are precisely the cosets of that normal subgroup. 

Fundamental theorem on homomorphisms<====>11527<====>Fundamental theorem on homomorphismsIn abstract algebra, the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms, also known as the fundamental homomorphism theorem, relates the structure of two objects between which a homomorphism is given, and of the kernel and image of the homomorphism. The homomorphism theorem is used to prove the isomorphism theorems. Group theoretic versionGiven two groups G and H and a group homomorphism f : G→H,  let K be a normal subgroup in G and φ the natural surjective homomorphism G→G/K (where G/K is a quotient group).  If K is a subset of ker(f) then there exists a unique homomorphism h:G/K→H such that f = h φ. 

Fermion<====>11529<====>FermionIn particle physics, a fermion is a particle that follows Fermi–Dirac statistics.  These particles obey the Pauli exclusion principle.  Fermions include all quarks and leptons, as well as all composite particles made of an odd number of these, such as all baryons and many atoms and nuclei.  Fermions differ from bosons, which obey Bose–Einstein statistics. A fermion can be an elementary particle, such as the electron, or it can be a composite particle, such as the proton.  According to the spin-statistics theorem in any reasonable relativistic quantum field theory, particles with integer spin are bosons, while particles with half-integer spin are fermions. 

Fred Savage<====>11530<====>Fred Savage   Frederick Aaron Savage (born July 9, 1976)  is an American actor, television director, and producer.   He is best known for his role as Kevin Arnold in the American television series The Wonder Years, which ran from 1988 to 1993.  He has earned several awards and nominations, such as People's Choice Awards and Young Artist Awards. Early lifeSavage was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Joanne and Lewis Savage, who was an industrial real estate broker and consultant.Savage grew up in Glencoe, Illinois, before moving out to California. 

Futurians<====>11531<====>Futurians  The Futurians were a group of science fiction (SF) fans, many of whom became editors and writers as well.  The Futurians were based in New York City and were a major force in the development of science fiction writing and science fiction fandom in the years 1937–1945. Origins of the groupAs described in Isaac Asimov's autobiography In Memory Yet Green, the Futurians spun off from the Greater New York Science Fiction Club (headed by Sam Moskowitz, later an influential SF editor and historian) over ideological differences, with the Futurians wishing to take a more overt political stance. 

First Fandom<====>11532<====>First FandomFirst Fandom is an informal association of early, active and well-known science fiction fans. In 1958 a number of fans at Midwestcon realized amid table-talk that they all had been active in fandom for more than 20 years.  This inspired the creation of an organization for longstanding fans under the initial chairmanship of Robert A.  Madle.  Originally only those fans who were known to have been active in fandom before the cutoff date, January 1, 1938, were eligible.  Such fannish activity (or "fanac") including writing to letter columns in science fiction magazines, having been published in fanzines, or having participated in science fiction oriented clubs, or just generally doing fannish things. 

Fianna Fáil<====>11536<====>Fianna Fáil  Fianna Fáil (Soldiers of Destiny or Warriors of Fál)   officially Fianna Fáil – The Republican Party,  ( ) name="Banchoff1999">is a political party in Ireland. The party was founded as an Irish republican party on 23 March 1926 by Éamon de Valera and his supporters after they split from Sinn Féin on the issue of abstentionism,  in the aftermath of the Irish Civil War.  Fianna Fáil has since 1927 been one of Ireland's two major parties, along with Fine Gael; both are seen as being centre-right parties, and as being to the right of the Labour Party and Sinn Féin. 

Fujiwara clan<====>11539<====>Fujiwara clan, descending from the Nakatomi clan and through them Ame-no-Koyane-no-Mikoto, was a powerful family of regents in Japan.  The clan originated when the founder, Nakatomi no Kamatari (614–669), was rewarded by Emperor Tenji with the honorific "Fujiwara", which evolved as a surname for Kamatari and his descendants.    In time, Fujiwara became known as a clan name.  The Fujiwara dominated the Japanese politics of Heian period (794–1185) through the monopoly of regent positions, sesshō and kampaku.   The family's primary strategy for central influence was through the marrying of Fujiwara daughters to emperors. 

Federalism<====>11542<====>Federalism  Federalism is the mixed or compound mode of government, combining a general government (the central or 'federal' government) with regional governments (provincial, state, cantonal, territorial or other sub-unit governments) in a single political system.  Its distinctive feature, exemplified in the founding example of modern federalism by the United States of America under the Constitution of 1787, is a relationship of parity between the two levels of government established.   It can thus be defined as a form of government in which there is a division of powers between two levels of government of equal status.  Federalism differs from confederalism, in which the general level of government is subordinate to the regional level, and from devolution within a unitary state, in which the regional level of government is subordinate to the general level. 

Firmin Abauzit<====>11543<====>Firmin Abauzit Firmin Abauzit (November 11, 1679 March 20, 1767) was a French scholar who worked on physics, theology and philosophy, and served as librarian in Geneva (Switzerland) during his final 40 years.  Abauzit is also notable for proofreading or correcting the writings of Isaac Newton and other scholars. BiographyFirmin Abauzit was born of Huguenot parents November 11, 1679 at Uzès, in Languedoc.   His father died when he was but two years of age; and when, on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, the authorities took steps to have him educated in the Roman Catholic faith, his mother contrived his escape. 

French Foreign Legion<====>11544<====>French Foreign Legion The French Foreign Legion ( ) (FFL;   ( ), L. É. ) is a military service branch of the French Army established in 1831, unique because it was created for foreign recruits willing to serve in the French Armed Forces.  The French Foreign Legion at origin was just another foreign formation ( ) among so many others that had already served France. Commanded by French officers, it is also open to French citizens, who amounted to 24% of the recruits in 2007.   The Foreign Legion is today known as a unit whose training focuses not only on traditional military skills but also on its strong esprit de corps as its men come from different countries with different cultures. 

Feedback<====>11545<====>Feedback   Feedback occurs when outputs of a system are routed back as inputs as part of a chain of cause-and-effect that forms a circuit or loop.The system can then be said to feed back into itself.  The notion of cause-and-effect has to be handled carefully when applied to feedback systems: HistorySelf-regulating mechanisms have existed since antiquity, and the idea of feedback had started to enter economic theory in Britain by the eighteenth century, but it wasn't at that time recognized as a universal abstraction and so didn't have a name.    The verb phrase "to feed back", in the sense of returning to an earlier position in a mechanical process, was in use in the US by the 1860s, "Heretofore . 

Furigana<====>11547<====>Furigana    is a Japanese reading aid, consisting of smaller kana, or syllabic characters, printed next to a kanji (ideographic character) or other character to indicate its pronunciation.  It is one type of ruby text.  Furigana is also known as   or   in Japanese.  In modern Japanese, it is mostly used to gloss rare kanji, to clarify rare, nonstandard or ambiguous kanji readings, or in children's or learners' materials.  Before the post-World War II script reforms, it was more widespread.    Furigana is most often written in hiragana, though katakana, alphabet letters or other kanji can also be used in certain special cases. 

Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor<====>11551<====>Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor Francis II ( ; 12 February 1768 – 2 March 1835) was the last Holy Roman Emperor, ruling from 1792 until 6 August 1806, when he dissolved the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation after the decisive defeat at the hands of the First French Empire led by Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz.  In 1804, he had founded the Austrian Empire and became Francis I, the first Emperor of Austria, ruling from 1804 to 1835, so later he was named the one and only Doppelkaiser (double emperor) in history.  For the two years between 1804 and 1806, Francis used the title and style by the Grace of God elected Roman Emperor, ever Augustus, hereditary Emperor of Austria and he was called the Emperor of both the Holy Roman Empire and Austria. 

Frederick Abel<====>11552<====>Frederick Abel   Sir Frederick Augustus Abel, 1st Baronet GCVO, KCB, FRS (17 July 1827  6 September 1902) was an English chemist. EducationBorn in London as son of Johann Leopold Abel, Abel studied chemistry at the Royal Polytechnic Institution and in 1845 became one of the original 26 students of A.  W.  von Hofmann at the Royal College of Chemistry.In 1852 he was appointed lecturer in chemistry at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich,  succeeding Michael Faraday,  who had held that post since 1829. Early careerFrom 1854 until 1888 Abel served as ordnance chemist at the Chemical Establishment of the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich,  establishing himself as the leading British authority on explosives. 

Fluorescence<====>11555<====>Fluorescence   Fluorescence is the emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation.  It is a form of luminescence.  In most cases, the emitted light has a longer wavelength, and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation.  The most striking example of fluorescence occurs when the absorbed radiation is in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum, and thus invisible to the human eye, while the emitted light is in the visible region, which gives the fluorescent substance a distinct color that can only be seen when exposed to UV light. 

Fundamental theorem of arithmetic<====>11556<====>Fundamental theorem of arithmetic In number theory, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, also called the unique factorization theorem or the unique-prime-factorization theorem, states that every integer greater than 1  either is prime itself or is the product of prime numbers, and that this product is unique, up to the order of the factors.For example,1200 = 2  × 3  × 5  = 5 × 2 × 5 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 2 = . . . The theorem is stating two things: first, that 1200 can be represented as a product of primes, and second, no matter how this is done, there will always be four 2s, one 3, two 5s, and no other primes in the product. 

Flamenco<====>11558<====>Flamenco  Flamenco ( ), in its strictest sense, is a professionalized art-form based on the various folkloric music traditions of Southern Spain in the autonomous communities of Andalusia, Extremadura and Murcia.  In a wider sense, it refers to these musical traditions and more modern musical styles which have themselves been deeply influenced by and become blurred with the development of flamenco over the past two centuries.  It includes cante (singing), toque (guitar playing), baile (dance), jaleo (vocalizations), palmas (handclapping) and pitos (finger snapping).  The oldest record of flamenco dates to 1774 in the book Las Cartas Marruecas by José Cadalso. 

Father Christmas<====>11561<====>Father Christmas   Father Christmas is the traditional English name for the personification of Christmas.  Although now known as a Christmas gift-bringer, and normally considered to be synonymous with American culture's Santa Claus which is now known worldwide, he was originally part of an unrelated and much older English folkloric tradition.  The recognisably modern figure of the English Father Christmas developed in the late Victorian period, but Christmas had been personified for centuries before then.    English personifications of Christmas were first recorded in the 15th century, with Father Christmas himself first appearing in the mid 17th century in the aftermath of the English Civil War. 

Federal jurisdiction (United States)<====>11563<====>Federal jurisdiction (United States)Federal jurisdiction refers to the legal scope of the government's powers in the United States of America.   See the 1962 Federal Report titled "JURISDICTION OVER FEDERAL AREAS WITHIN THE STATES".   The United States is a federal republic, governed by the U. S.  Constitution, containing fifty states and a federal district which elect the President and Vice President, and having other territories and possessions in its national jurisdiction.   This government is variously known as the Union, the United States, or the federal government. Under the Constitution and various treaties, the legal jurisdiction of the United States includes territories and territorial waters.

Frequency modulation synthesis<====>11569<====>Frequency modulation synthesisFM synthesis using 2 operators  A 220 Hz carrier tone f c  modulated by a 440 Hz modulating tone f m , with various choices of frequency modulation index, β.  The time domain signals are illustrated above, and the corresponding spectra are shown below (spectrum amplitudes in dB).  Waveforms for each β: Spectra for each β: In audio and music, frequency modulation synthesis (or FM synthesis) is a form of audio synthesis where the timbre of a simple waveform (such as a square, triangle, or sawtooth) is changed by modulating its frequency with a modulator frequency that is also in the same or similar audio range, resulting in a more complex waveform and a different-sounding tone that can also be described as "gritty" if it is a thick and dark timbre. 

Friedrich Bessel<====>11574<====>Friedrich Bessel  Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel ( ; 22 July 1784 – 17 March 1846) was a German astronomer, mathematician, physicist and geodesist.  He was the first astronomer who determined reliable values for the distance from the sun to another star by the method of parallax.  A special type of mathematical functions were named Bessel functions after Bessel's death, though they had originally been discovered by Daniel Bernoulli and then generalised by Bessel. Life and familyBessel was born in Minden, Westphalia, administrative center of Minden-Ravensberg, as second son of a civil servant.  He was born into a large family in Germany. 

Fermi paradox<====>11579<====>Fermi paradox The Fermi paradox or Fermi's paradox, named after physicist Enrico Fermi, is the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence and high probability estimates  for the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations.The basic points of the argument, made by physicists Enrico Fermi (1901–1954) and Michael H.  Hart (born 1932), are:There are billions of stars in the galaxy that are similar to the Sun,  , and many of these stars are billions of years older than the Solar system.   With high probability, some of these stars have Earth-like planets,   and if the Earth is typical, some may have developed intelligent life. 

Fundamentalism<====>11582<====>Fundamentalism    Fundamentalism usually has a religious connotation that indicates unwavering attachment to a set of irreducible beliefs.   However, fundamentalism has come to be applied to a tendency among certain groups—mainly, though not exclusively, in religion—that is characterized by a markedly strict literalism as it is applied to certain specific scriptures, dogmas, or ideologies, and a strong sense of the importance of maintaining ingroup and outgroup distinctions,  Kunst, J. , Thomsen, L. , Sam, D.

Show Me Love (film)<====>11585<====>Show Me Love (film)  Show Me Love is the English distribution name for the Swedish film Fucking Åmål ( ), which was released to cinemas in Sweden on 23 October 1998  and directed by Lukas Moodysson. The film follows the lives of two seemingly disparate teenage girls who begin a tentative romantic relationship.  It first premiered outside Sweden at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.  For writer Moodysson, it was his directorial debut in a full-length film.  Starring in the lead roles were Rebecka Liljeberg, as Agnes, and Alexandra Dahlström, as Elin.  The film received an overwhelmingly positive reception    and won four Guldbagge Awards (Sweden's official film awards) at the 1999 ceremony. 

Full disclosure (computer security)<====>11586<====>Full disclosure (computer security) In the field of computer security, independent researchers often discover flaws in software that can be abused to cause unintended behaviour, these flaws are called vulnerabilities.  The process by which the analysis of these vulnerabilities is shared with third parties is the subject of much debate, and is referred to as the researcher’s disclosure policy.  Full disclosure is the practice of publishing analysis of software vulnerabilities as early as possible, making the data accessible to everyone without restriction.  The primary purpose of widely disseminating information about vulnerabilities is so that potential victims are as knowledgeable as those who attack them. 

Feminist theology<====>11587<====>Feminist theology   Feminist theology is a movement found in several religions, including Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism, and New Thought, to reconsider the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of those religions from a feminist perspective.  Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about God, determining women's place in relation to career and motherhood, and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts and matriarchal religion. Methodology Feminist theology attempts to consider every aspect of religious practice and thought.  Some of the questions feminist theologians ask are:How do we do theology? The basic question of how theologians may go about creating systems of thought is currently being reinterpreted by feminist theologians. 

Freeware<====>11592<====>Freeware Freeware is software that is available for use at no monetary cost.  In other words, while freeware may be used without payment it is most often proprietary software, as usually modification, re-distribution or reverse-engineering without the author's permission is prohibited.  Two historic examples of freeware include Skype and Adobe Acrobat Reader.  There is no agreed set of rights or a license or an EULA which would define "freeware" unambiguously; every Freeware publisher defines their own rules for their Freeware.  For instance, redistribution of Freeware by third-parties is often permitted but there is a significant portion of Freeware which prohibits redistribution. 

Flat Earth<====>11593<====>Flat Earth The flat Earth model is an archaic  conception of Earth's shape as a plane or disk.  Many ancient cultures subscribed to a flat Earth cosmography, including Greece until the classical period, the Bronze Age and Iron Age civilizations of the Near East until the Hellenistic period, India until the Gupta period (early centuries AD), and China until the 17th century.  That paradigm was also typically held in the aboriginal cultures of the Americas, and the notion of a flat Earth domed by the firmament in the shape of an inverted bowl was common in pre-scientific societies. 

Persian language<====>11600<====>Persian language    Persian (  or  ), also known by its endonym Farsi (), is one of the Western Iranian languages within the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family.  It is primarily spoken in Iran, Afghanistan (officially known as Dari since 1958),  and Tajikistan (officially known as Tajiki since the Soviet era),  and some other regions which historically were Persianate societies and considered part of Greater Iran.  It is written in the Persian alphabet, a modified variant of the Arabic script. The Persian language is classified as a continuation of Middle Persian, the official religious and literary language of the Sasanian Empire, itself a continuation of Old Persian, the language of the Achaemenid Empire. 

Frances Abington<====>11603<====>Frances Abington  Frances "Fanny" Abington (1737 – 4 March 1815)  was a British actress, known not only for her acting, but her sense of fashion.  BiographyShe was born Frances Barton or Frances "Fanny" Barton, the daughter of a private soldier, and began her career as a flower girl and a street singer.  She was also rumored that she would recite Shakespeare in Taverns at the age of 12 and for a short period of time was a prostitute to help her family in the hard times.   Later she became a servant to a French milliner. 

Finite field<====>11615<====>Finite field  In mathematics, a finite field or Galois field (so-named in honor of Évariste Galois) is a field that contains a finite number of elements.   As with any field, a finite field is a set on which the operations of multiplication, addition, subtraction and division are defined and satisfy certain basic rules.   The most common examples of finite fields are given by the integers mod   when   is a prime number. Finite fields are fundamental in a number of areas of mathematics and computer science, including number theory, algebraic geometry, Galois theory, finite geometry, cryptography and coding theory. 

Franchising<====>11616<====>Franchising  Franchising is based on a marketing concept which can be adopted by an organisation as a strategy for business expansion.  Where implemented, a franchiser licenses its know-how, procedures, intellectual property, use of it's business model, brand; and rights to sell its branded products and services to a franchisee.  In return the franchisee pays certain fees and agrees to comply with certain obligations, typically set out in a Franchise Agreement. The word "franchise" is of Anglo-French derivation—from franc, meaning free—and is used both as a noun and as a (transitive) verb.  For the franchisor, use of a franchise system is an alternative business growth strategy, compared to say expansion through corporate owned outlets or "chain stores". 

Feynman diagram<====>11617<====>Feynman diagram   In theoretical physics, Feynman diagrams are pictorial representations of the mathematical expressions describing the behavior of subatomic particles.  The scheme is named after its inventor, American physicist Richard Feynman, and was first introduced in 1948.  The interaction of sub-atomic particles can be complex and difficult to understand intuitively.  Feynman diagrams give a simple visualization of what would otherwise be an arcane and abstract formula.  As David Kaiser writes, "since the middle of the 20th century, theoretical physicists have increasingly turned to this tool to help them undertake critical calculations", and so "Feynman diagrams have revolutionized nearly every aspect of theoretical physics". 

Food writing<====>11619<====>Food writingFood writing is writing that focuses on the topic of food, both widely and narrowly defined, and includes work by food critics and food historians. DefinitionFood writers regard food as a substance and as a cultural phenomenon.  John T.  Edge, an American food writer, explains how writers in the genre view its topic: "Food is essential to life.  It’s arguably our nation’s biggest industry.  Food, not sex, is our most frequently indulged pleasure.  Food—too much, not enough, the wrong kind, the wrong frequency—is one of our society’s greatest causes of disease and death. "   Another American food writer, Mark Kurlansky, links this vision of food directly to food writing, giving the genre's scope and range when he observes: “Food is about agriculture, about ecology, about man’s relationship with nature, about the climate, about nation-building, cultural struggles, friends and enemies, alliances, wars, religion. 

Futurama (New York World's Fair)<====>11621<====>Futurama (New York World's Fair) Futurama was an exhibit/ride at the 1939 New York World's Fair designed by Norman Bel Geddes that presented a possible model of the world 20 years into the future (1959–60).  Sponsored by the General Motors Corporation, the installation was characterized by its automated highways and vast suburbs.  OverviewCompared to other "visions of the future," Bel Geddes' was rather achievable—the most advanced technology posited was the automated highway system, of which General Motors built a working prototype by 1960.  Futurama is widely held to have first introduced the general American public to the concept of a network of expressways connecting the nation. 

Francesco I Sforza<====>11623<====>Francesco I Sforza  Francesco I Sforza ( ; 23 July 1401 – 8 March 1466) was an Italian condottiero, the founder of the Sforza dynasty in Milan, Italy, and was the fourth Duke of Milan from 1450 until his death.  He was the brother of Alessandro, whom he often fought alongside. BiographyEarly lifeFrancesco Sforza was born in San Miniato, Tuscany, one of the seven illegitimate sons of the condottiero Muzio Sforza and Lucia da Torsano.  He spent his childhood in Tricarico (in the modern Basilicata), the marquisate of which he was granted in 1412 by King Ladislaus of Naples. 

Folk dance<====>11624<====>Folk dance Folk dances are dances that are developed by people that reflect the life of the people of a certain country or region.  Not all ethnic dances are folk dances; for example, ritual dances or dances of ritual origin are not considered to be folk dances.  Ritual dances are usually called "Religious dances" because of their purpose. The terms "ethnic" and "traditional" are used when it is required to emphasize the cultural roots of the dance.  In this sense, nearly all folk dances are ethnic ones.  If some dances, such as polka, cross ethnic boundaries and even cross the boundary between "folk" and "ballroom dance", ethnic differences are often considerable enough to mention, e. 

Fyodor Dostoyevsky<====>11625<====>Fyodor Dostoyevsky  Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky  ( ;   ; 11 November 1821 9 February 1881),  sometimes transliterated Dostoevsky, was a Russian novelist, short story writer, essayist, journalist and philosopher.  Dostoyevsky's literary works explore human psychology in the troubled political, social, and spiritual atmospheres of 19th-century Russia, and engage with a variety of realistic philosophical and religious themes. He began writing in his 20s, and his first novel, Poor Folk, was published in 1846 when he was 25.  His most acclaimed works include Crime and Punishment (1866), The Idiot (1869), Demons (1872) and The Brothers Karamazov (1880). 

Faith healing<====>11627<====>Faith healing  Faith healing is the practice of prayer and gestures (such as laying on of hands) that are claimed to elicit divine intervention in spiritual and physical healing, especially the Christian practice.   Believers assert that the healing of disease and disability can be brought about by religious faith through prayer and/or other rituals that, according to adherents, stimulate a divine presence and power.  Belief in such divine intervention is derived from religious belief.  Claims "attributed to a myriad of techniques" such as prayer, divine intervention, or the ministrations of an individual healer can cure illness have been popular throughout history. 

Fritz Lang<====>11631<====>Fritz Lang   Friedrich Christian Anton "Fritz" Lang (December 5, 1890 – August 2, 1976) was an Austrian-German-American filmmaker, screenwriter, and occasional film producer and actor.  Obituary Variety, August 4, 1976, page 63.   One of the best-known émigrés from Germany's school of Expressionism, he was dubbed the "Master of Darkness" by the British Film Institute.  His most famous films include the groundbreaking futuristic Metropolis (1927) and the also influential M (1931), a film noir precursor that he made before he moved to the United States. Life and careerEarly lifeLang was born in Vienna as the second son of Anton Lang (1860–1940),  an architect and construction company manager, and his wife Pauline "Paula" Lang   Schlesinger (1864–1920). 

Food and Drug Administration<====>11632<====>Food and Drug Administration   The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or USFDA) is a federal agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, one of the United States federal executive departments.  The FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the control and supervision of food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs (medications), vaccines, biopharmaceuticals, blood transfusions, medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices (ERED), cosmetics, animal foods & feed  and veterinary products.  As of 2017, 3/4th of the FDA budget (approximately $700 million) is funded by the pharmaceutical companies due to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. 

Field extension<====>11634<====>Field extensionIn mathematics, and in particular, algebra, a field E is an extension field of a field F if E contains F.   Equivalently, F is a subfield of E.For example, under the usual notions of addition and multiplication, the complex numbers are an extension field of the real numbers; the real numbers are a subfield of the complex numbers. Field extensions are fundamental in algebraic number theory, and in the study of polynomial roots through Galois theory, and are widely used in algebraic geometry. SubfieldA subfield of a field L is a subset K of L that is a field with respect to the field operations inherited from L. 

Flood fill<====>11635<====>Flood fill Flood fill, also called seed fill, is an algorithm that determines the area connected to a given node in a multi-dimensional array.  It is used in the "bucket" fill tool of paint programs to fill connected, similarly-colored areas with a different color, and in games such as Go and Minesweeper for determining which pieces are cleared.  When applied on an image to fill a particular bounded area with color. The algorithmThe flood-fill algorithm takes three parameters: a start node, a target color, and a replacement color.  The algorithm looks for all nodes in the array that are connected to the start node by a path of the target color and changes them to the replacement color. 

Francis of Assisi<====>11638<====>Francis of Assisi  Saint Francis of Assisi ( ), born Giovanni di Pietro di Bernardone, informally named as Francesco (1181/1182 3 October 1226),  was an Italian Catholic friar, deacon and preacher.  He founded the men's Order of Friars Minor, the women’s Order of Saint Clare, the Third Order of Saint Francis and the Custody of the Holy Land.  Francis is one of the most venerated religious figures in history.  Pope Gregory IX canonized Francis on 16 July 1228.  Along with Saint Catherine of Siena, he was designated Patron saint of Italy.  He later became associated with patronage of animals and the natural environment, and it became customary for Catholic and Anglican churches to hold ceremonies blessing animals on his feast day of 4 October. 

General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon<====>11642<====>General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon  The General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon is a single-engine supersonic multirole fighter aircraft originally developed by General Dynamics (now Lockheed Martin) for the United States Air Force (USAF).   Designed as an air superiority day fighter, it evolved into a successful all-weather multirole aircraft.   Over 4,500 aircraft have been built since production was approved in 1976.Although no longer being purchased by the U. S.  Air Force, improved versions are still being built for export customers.   In 1993, General Dynamics sold its aircraft manufacturing business to the Lockheed Corporation,  which in turn became part of Lockheed Martin after a 1995 merger with Martin Marietta. 

First Council of Constantinople<====>11643<====>First Council of ConstantinopleThe First Council of Constantinople (  commonly known as  , "Second Ecumenical";   or  ) was a council of Christian bishops convened in Constantinople in AD 381 by the Roman Emperor Theodosius I.

Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)<====>11644<====>Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)   The Fourth Council of Constantinople, accepted by some Eastern Orthodox as the Eighth Ecumenical Council,  was held in 879–880.  It confirmed the reinstatement of Photius as Patriarch of Constantinople. BackgroundThe Council settled the dispute that had broken out after the deposition of Ignatius as Patriarch of Constantinople in 858.  Ignatius, himself appointed to his office in an uncanonical manner, opposed Caesar Bardas, who had deposed the regent Theodora.  In response, Bardas' nephew, the youthful Emperor Michael III engineered Ignatius's deposition and confinement on the charge of treason.  The patriarchal throne was filled with Photius, a renowned scholar and kinsman of Bardas. 

Friedrich Hayek<====>11646<====>Friedrich Hayek   Friedrich Hayek   ( ;  ; 8 May 1899 23 March 1992), born in Austria-Hungary as Friedrich August von Hayek and frequently referred to as F.  A.  Hayek, was an Austrian-British economist and philosopher best known for his defense of classical liberalism.  Hayek shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Gunnar Myrdal for his "pioneering work in the theory of money and economic fluctuations and . . .  penetrating analysis of the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena".  Hayek was a major social theorist and political philosopher of the twentieth century,   and his account of how changing prices communicate information that helps individuals co-ordinate their plans is widely regarded as an important achievement in economics,  leading to his Nobel Prize.

Factoid<====>11655<====>FactoidA factoid is either a false statement presented as a factor a true, but brief or trivial item of news or information, alternatively known as a factlet. The term was coined in 1973 by American writer Norman Mailer to mean a piece of information that becomes accepted as a fact even though it is not actually true, or an invented fact believed to be true because it appears in print.  Paul Dickson  April 30, 2014, Time Magazine, The origins of writerly words, Retrieved November 14, 2015  Since its creation in 1973, the term has evolved, now often being used to describe a brief or trivial item of news or information. 

Figured bass<====>11656<====>Figured bass Figured bass, or thoroughbass, is a kind of musical notation in which numerals and symbols (often accidentals) indicate intervals, chords, and non-chord tones that a musician playing piano, harpsichord, organ, lute (or other instruments capable of playing chords) play in relation to the bass note that these numbers and symbols appear above or below.  Figured bass is closely associated with basso continuo, a historically improvised accompaniment used in almost all genres of music in the Baroque period of Classical music ( 1600–1750), though rarely in modern music. Other systems for denoting or representing chords include  plain staff notation, used in classical music; Roman numerals, commonly used in harmonic analysis;  macro symbols, sometimes used in modern musicology; the Nashville number system; and various chord names and symbols used in jazz and popular music (e. 

Fashion<====>11657<====>Fashion  Fashion is a popular style or practice, especially in clothing, footwear, accessories, makeup, hairstyle and body.  Fashion is a distinctive and often constant trend in the style in which a person dresses.  It is the prevailing styles in behaviour and the newest creations of textile designers.   Because the more technical term costume is regularly linked to the term "fashion", the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like fancy dress or masquerade wear, while "fashion" generally means clothing, including the study of it.   Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are androgynous. 

Fourier analysis<====>11659<====>Fourier analysis  In mathematics, Fourier analysis ( )  is the study of the way general functions may be represented or approximated by sums of simpler trigonometric functions.  Fourier analysis grew from the study of Fourier series, and is named after Joseph Fourier, who showed that representing a function as a sum of trigonometric functions greatly simplifies the study of heat transfer. Today, the subject of Fourier analysis encompasses a vast spectrum of mathematics.  In the sciences and engineering, the process of decomposing a function into oscillatory components is often called Fourier analysis, while the operation of rebuilding the function from these pieces is known as Fourier synthesis. 

Fat Man<====>11660<====>Fat Man    "Fat Man" was the codename for the atomic bomb that was detonated over the Japanese city of Nagasaki by the United States on 9 August 1945.  It was the second of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in warfare, the first being Little Boy, and its detonation marked the third-ever man-made nuclear explosion in history.  It was built by scientists and engineers at Los Alamos Laboratory using plutonium from the Hanford Site and dropped from the Boeing B-29 Superfortress Bockscar.  For the Fat Man mission, Bockscar was piloted by Major Charles W. 

False Claims Act<====>11661<====>False Claims ActThe False Claims Act,  also called the "Lincoln Law") is an American federal law that imposes liability on persons and companies (typically federal contractors) who defraud governmental programs.  It is the federal Government's primary litigation tool in combating fraud against the Government.    The law includes a qui tam provision that allows people who are not affiliated with the government, called "relators" under the law, to file actions on behalf of the government (informally called "whistleblowing" especially when the relator is employed by the organization accused in the suit).   Persons filing under the Act stand to receive a portion (usually about 15–25 percent) of any recovered damages. 

Fantastic Four<====>11664<====>Fantastic Four  The Fantastic Four is a fictional superhero team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The group debuted in The Fantastic Four #1 (cover dated Nov. 1961), which helped to usher in a new level of realism in the medium. The Fantastic Four was the first superhero team created by editor/co-plotter Stan Lee and artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby, who developed a collaborative approach to creating comics with this title that they would use from then on.The four individuals traditionally associated with the Fantastic Four, who gained superpowers after exposure to cosmic rays during a scientific mission to outer space, are Mister Fantastic (Reed Richards), a scientific genius and the leader of the group, who can stretch his body into incredible lengths and shapes; the Invisible Woman (Susan "Sue" Storm), who eventually married Reed, who can render herself invisible and later project powerful invisible force fields; the Human Torch (Johnny Storm), Sue's younger brother, who can generate flames, surround himself with them and fly; and the monstrous Thing (Ben Grimm), their grumpy but benevolent friend, a former college football star and Reed's college roommate as well as a good pilot, who possesses tremendous superhuman strength, durability, and endurance due to the nature of his stone-like flesh.Since their original 1961 introduction, the Fantastic Four have been portrayed as a somewhat dysfunctional, yet loving, family. Breaking convention with other comic book archetypes of the time, they would squabble and hold grudges both deep and petty and eschewed anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status. The team is also well known for its recurring encounters with characters such as the villainous monarch Doctor Doom, the planet-devouring Galactus, the sea-dwelling prince Namor, the spacefaring Silver Surfer and the shape-changing alien Skrulls.The Fantastic Four have been adapted into other media, including four animated series and four live-action films.Publication historyOriginsApocryphal legend has it that in 1961, longtime magazine and comic book publisher Martin Goodman was playing golf with either Jack Liebowitz or Irwin Donenfeld of rival company DC Comics, then known as National Periodical Publications,   and that the top executive bragged about DC's success with the new superhero team the Justice League of America. That DC all-star superhero team had debuted in The Brave and the Bold #28 (cover-dated Feb. 1960) before going on to its own hit title (issue #1 cover-dated Nov. 1960).  While film producer and comics historian Michael Uslan has debunked the particulars of that story, Uslan, in a letter published in Alter Ego #43 (December 2004), pp. 43–44, writes: "Irwin Donenfeld said he never played golf with Goodman, so the story is untrue. I heard this story more than a couple of times while sitting in the lunchroom at DC's 909 Third Avenue and 75 Rockefeller Plaza office as Sol Harrison and [production chief] Jack Adler were schmoozing with some of us... who worked for DC during our college summers.... [T]he way I heard the story from Sol was that Goodman was playing with one of the heads of Independent News, not DC Comics (though DC owned Independent News). ... As the distributor of DC Comics, this man certainly knew all the sales figures and was in the best position to tell this tidbit to Goodman. ... Of course, Goodman would want to be playing golf with this fellow and be in his good graces. ... Sol worked closely with Independent News' top management over the decades and would have gotten this story straight from the horse's mouth."  Goodman, a publishing trend-follower, aware of the JLA's strong sales, did direct his comics editor, Stan Lee, to create a comic-book series about a team of superheroes. According to Lee, writing in 1974, "Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most. It was a book called The   Justice League of America and it was composed of a team of superheroes. ... 'If the Justice League is selling', spoke he, 'why don't we put out a comic book that features a team of superheroes?'"    Lee, who had served as editor-in-chief and art director of Marvel Comics and its predecessor companies, Timely Comics and Atlas Comics, for two decades, found that the medium had become creatively restrictive. Determined "to carve a real career for myself in the nowhere world of comic books",    Lee concluded that, "For just this once, I would do the type of story I myself would enjoy reading.... And the characters would be the kind of characters I could personally relate to: they'd be flesh and blood, they'd have their faults and foibles, they'd be fallible and feisty, and — most important of all — inside their colorful, costumed booties they'd still have feet of clay."  Lee said he created a synopsis for the first Fantastic Four story that he gave to penciller Jack Kirby, who then drew the entire story. Kirby turned in his penciled art pages to Lee, who added dialogue and captions. This approach to creating comics, which became known as the "Marvel Method", worked so well for Lee and Kirby that they used it from then on; the Marvel Method became standard for the company within a year.    Kirby recalled events somewhat differently. Challenged with Lee's version of events in a 1990 interview, Kirby responded: "I would say that's an outright lie",   Reprinted inalthough the interviewer, Gary Groth, notes that this statement needs to be viewed with caution. Groth explains in his 2002 introduction to the interview that Kirby's state of mind needs to be taken into consideration when evaluating certain statements within the interview. Kirby was involved in an acrimonious dispute with Marvel Comics regarding the return of his artwork, and his relationship with Lee had deteriorated, in part due to this dispute but also due to Lee's public statements through the years, which Kirby saw as diminishing his role. Groth states: "Lee's contribution is a matter for endless speculation, but most observers and historians consider Kirby's claims here to be excessive."  Kirby claims he came up with the idea for the Fantastic Four in Marvel's offices, and that Lee had merely added the dialogue after the story had been pencilled.   Kirby also sought to establish, more credibly and on numerous occasions, that the visual elements of the strip were his conceptions. He regularly pointed to a team he had created for rival publisher DC Comics in the 1950s, the Challengers of the Unknown. "[I]f you notice the uniforms, they're the same... I always give them a skintight uniform with a belt... the Challengers and the FF have a minimum of decoration. And of course, the Thing's skin is a kind of decoration, breaking up the monotony of the blue uniform."   The chest insignia of a "4" within a circle, however, was designed by Lee.  The characters wear no uniforms in the first two issues.Given the conflicting statements, outside commentators have found it hard to identify with precise detail who created the Fantastic Four. Although Stan Lee's typed synopsis for the Fantastic Four exists, Earl Wells, writing in The Comics Journal, points out that its existence does not assert its place in the creation: "[W]e have no way of knowing of whether Lee wrote the synopsis after a discussion with Kirby in which Kirby supplied most of the ideas".   Reprinted in George, The Comics Journal Library.   Comics historian R. C. Harvey believes that the Fantastic Four was a furtherance of the work Kirby had been doing previously, and so "more likely Kirby's creations than Lee's".   Reprinted in George, The Comics Journal Library.   But Harvey notes that the Marvel Method of collaboration allowed each man to claim credit,   and that Lee's dialogue added to the direction the team took.   Wells argues that it was Lee's contributions which set the framework within which Kirby worked, and this made Lee "more responsible".   Comics historian Mark Evanier, a studio assistant to Jack Kirby in the 1970s, says that the considered opinion of Lee and Kirby's contemporaries was "that Fantastic Four was created by Stan and Jack. No further division of credit seemed appropriate".  1961–1970sThe release of The Fantastic Four #1 (Nov. 1961) was an unexpected success. Lee had felt ready to leave the comics field at the time, but the positive response to Fantastic Four persuaded him to stay on.  The title began to receive fan mail  and Lee started printing the letters in a letter column with issue #3. Also with the third issue, Lee created the hyperbolic slogan "The Greatest Comic Magazine in the World!!" With the following issue, the slogan was changed to "The World's Greatest Comic Magazine!" and became a fixture on the issue covers into the 1990s,   and on numerous covers in the 2000s.Issue #4 (May 1962) reintroduced Namor the Sub-Mariner,  an aquatic antihero who was a star character of Marvel's earliest iteration, Timely Comics, during the late 1930s and 1940s period that historians and fans call the Golden Age of Comics. Issue #5 (July 1962) introduced the team's most frequent nemesis, Doctor Doom.  These earliest issues were published bimonthly. With issue #16 (July 1963), the cover title dropped its The and became simply Fantastic Four.While the early stories were complete narratives, the frequent appearances of these two antagonists, Doom and Namor, in subsequent issues indicated the creation of a long narrative by Lee and Kirby that extended over months. According to comics historian Les Daniels, "only narratives that ran to several issues would be able to contain their increasingly complex ideas".   During its creators' lengthy run, the series produced many acclaimed storylines and characters that have become central to Marvel, including the hidden race of alien-human genetic experiments, the Inhumans;  DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 111: "The Inhumans, a lost race that diverged from humankind 25,000 years ago and became genetically enhanced."  the Black Panther,  an African king who would be mainstream comics' first black superhero;  the rival alien races the Kree and the shapeshifting Skrulls; DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 84: "The second issue of the increasingly popular The Fantastic Four introduced the shapeshifting Skrulls, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby...Like the 1956 sci-fi mmovie The Invasion of the Body-Snatchers, Lee and Kirby tapped into a fear that gripped the U.S. at this time: the fear that Russian spies were infiltrating society."  Him, who would become Adam Warlock;  the Negative Zone and unstable molecules. The story frequently cited as Lee and Kirby's finest achievementis the three-part "Galactus Trilogy" that began in Fantastic Four #48 (March 1966), chronicling the arrival of Galactus, a cosmic giant who wanted to devour the planet, and his herald, the Silver Surfer.   Fantastic Four #48 was chosen as #24 in the 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time poll of Marvel's readers in 2001. Editor Robert Greenberger wrote in his introduction to the story that, "As the fourth year of the Fantastic Four came to a close, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby seemed to be only warming up. In retrospect, it was perhaps the most fertile period of any monthly title during the Marvel Age."  Daniels noted that "[t]he mystical and metaphysical elements that took over the saga were perfectly suited to the tastes of young readers in the 1960s", and Lee soon discovered that the story was a favorite on college campuses.   The Fantastic Four Annual was used to spotlight several key events. The Sub-Mariner was crowned king of Atlantis in the first annual (1963).  The following year's annual revealed the origin story of Doctor Doom.  Fantastic Four Annual #3 (1965) presented the wedding of Reed Richards and Sue Storm.  Lee and Kirby reintroduced the original Human Torch in Fantastic Four Annual #4 (1966) and had him battle Johnny Storm.  Sue Richards' pregnancy was announced in Fantastic Four Annual #5 (1967), and the Richards' son, Franklin Richards was born in Fantastic Four Annual #6 (1968) DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 133: "November [1968] saw the birth of Franklin Richards, the son of Reed and Sue."  in a story which introduced Annihilus as well. DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 133: "Annihilus first encountered humanity when Mr. Fantastic, the Human Torch, and the Thing entered the Negative Zone in search of anti-matter particles." Marvel filed for a trademark for "Fantastic Four" in 1967 and the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued the registration in 1970. Kirby left Marvel in mid-1970,  having drawn the first 102 issues plus an unfinished issue, partially published in Fantastic Four #108, with alterations, and later completed and published as Fantastic Four: The Lost Adventure (April 2008), Fantastic Four continued with Lee, Roy Thomas,  Gerry Conway and Marv Wolfman as its consecutive regular writers, working with artists such as John Romita Sr., John Buscema, Rich Buckler and George Pérez, with longtime inker Joe Sinnott adding some visual continuity. Jim Steranko also contributed some covers during this time. A short-lived series starring the team, Giant-Size Super-Stars, began in May 1974 and changed its title to Giant-Size Fantastic Four with issue #2.  The fourth issue introduced Jamie Madrox, a character who later became part of the X-Men.  Giant-Size Fantastic Four was canceled with issue #6 (Oct. 1975).  Roy Thomas and George Pérez crafted a metafictional story for Fantastic Four #176 (Nov. 1976) in which the Impossible Man visited the offices of Marvel Comics and met numerous comics creators.  Marv Wolfman and Keith Pollard crafted a multi-issue storyline involving the son of Doctor Doom which culminated in issue #200 (Nov. 1978).  John Byrne joined the title with issue #209 (Aug. 1979), doing pencil breakdowns for Sinnott to finish. He and Wolfman introduced a new herald for Galactus named Terrax the Tamer in #211 (Oct. 1979). 1980s and 1990sBill Mantlo briefly followed Wolfman as writer of the series and wrote a crossover with Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #42 (May 1980).    Byrne wrote and drew a giant-sized Fantastic Four promotional comic for Coca-Cola, which was rejected by Coca-Cola as being too violent and published as Fantastic Four #220–221 (July–Aug. 1980) instead.    Writer Doug Moench and penciller Bill Sienkiewicz then took over for 10 issues. With issue #232 (July 1981), the aptly titled "Back to the Basics",  Byrne began his run as writer, penciller and inker, the last under the pseudonym Bjorn Heyn for this issue only. Byrne revitalized the slumping title with his run.   Originally, Byrne was slated to write with Sienkiewicz providing the art. Sienkiewicz left to do Moon Knight, and Byrne subsequently became writer, artist, and inker. Various editors were assigned to the comic; eventually Bob Budiansky became the regular editor. Byrne told Jim Shooter that he could not work with Budiansky, although they ultimately continued to work together. In 2006, Byrne said "that's my paranoia. I look back and I think that was Shooter trying to force me off the book". Byrne left following issue #293 (Aug. 1986) in the middle of a story arc, explaining he could not recapture the fun he had previously had on the series.  One of Byrne's changes was making the Invisible Girl into the Invisible Woman:  assertive and confident. During this period, fans came to recognize that she was quite powerful, whereas previously, she had been primarily seen as a superpowered mother and wife in the tradition of television moms like those played by Donna Reed and Florence Henderson. Byrne staked new directions in the characters' personal lives, having the married Sue Storm and Reed Richards suffer a miscarriage and the Thing quitting the Fantastic Four, with She-Hulk being recruited as his long-term replacement. He also re-emphasized the family dynamic which he felt the series had drifted away from after the Lee/Kirby run, commenting that, "Family—and not dysfunctional family—is the central, key element to the FF. It is an absolutely vital dynamic between the characters." [emphases in original] Byrne was followed by a quick succession of writers: Roger Stern, Tom DeFalco, and Roy Thomas. Steve Englehart took over as writer for issues 304–332 (except #320). The title had been struggling, so Englehart decided to make radical changes. He felt the title had become stale with the normal makeup of Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny, so in issue #308 Reed and Sue retired and were replaced with the Thing's new girlfriend, Sharon Ventura, and Johnny Storm's former love, Crystal. The changes increased readership through issue #321. At this point, Marvel made decisions about another Englehart comic, West Coast Avengers, that he disagreed with, and in protest he changed his byline to S.F.X. Englehart (S.F.X. is the abbreviation for Simple Sound Effects). In issue #326, Englehart was told to bring Reed and Sue back and undo the other changes he had made. This caused Englehart to take his name entirely off the book. He used the pseudonym John Harkness, which he had created years before for work he didn't want to be associated with. According to Englehart, the run from #326 through his last issue, #332, was "one of the most painful stretches of [his] career."  Writer-artist Walt Simonson took over as writer with #334 (December 1989), and three issues later began pencilling and inking as well. With brief inking exceptions, two fill-in issues, and a three-issue stint drawn by Arthur Adams, Manning, Matthew K. "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 252: "Spider-Man, the Hulk, Wolverine, and Ghost Rider were tricked into forming a new Fantastic Four...Written by Walter Simonson with art by Arthur Adams, this new FF found themselves locked in battle with the Mole Man."   Simonson remained in all three positions through #354 (July 1991).Simonson, who had been writing the team comic The Avengers, had gotten approval for Reed and Sue to join that team after Engelhart had written them out of Fantastic Four. Yet by The Avengers #300, where they were scheduled to join the team, Simonson was told the characters were returning to Fantastic Four. This led to Simonson quitting The Avengers after that issue. Shortly afterward, he was offered the job of writing Fantastic Four. Having already prepared a number of stories involving the Avengers with Reed and Sue in the lineup, he then rewrote these for Fantastic Four. Simonson later recalled that working on Fantastic Four allowed him the latitude to use original Avengers members Thor and Iron Man, which he had been precluded from using in The Avengers. After another fill-in, the regular team of writer and Marvel editor-in-chief Tom DeFalco, penciller Paul Ryan and inker Dan Bulanadi took over, with Ryan self-inking beginning with #360 (Jan. 1992). That team, with the very occasional different inker, continued for years through #414 (July 1996). DeFalco nullified the Storm-Masters marriage by retconning that the alien Skrull Empire had kidnapped the real Masters and replaced her with a spy named Lyja. Once discovered, Lyja, who herself had fallen for Storm, helped the Fantastic Four rescue Masters. Ventura departed after being further mutated by Doctor Doom. Although some fans were not pleased with DeFalco's run on Fantastic Four, calling him "The Great Satan", the title's sales increased over the period. Other key developments included Franklin Richards being sent into the future and returning as a teenager; the return of Reed's time-traveling father, Nathaniel, who is revealed to be the father of time-travelling villain Kang the Conqueror and Reed's apparent death at the hands of a seemingly mortally wounded Doctor Doom.  It would be two years before DeFalco resurrected the two characters, revealing that their "deaths" were orchestrated by the supervillain Hyperstorm.The ongoing series was canceled with issue #416 (Sept. 1996) and relaunched with vol. 2, #1 (Nov. 1996) as part of the multi-series "Heroes Reborn" crossover story arc. The yearlong volume retold the team's first adventures in a more contemporary style,  and set in a parallel universe. Following the end of that experiment, Fantastic Four was relaunched with vol. 3, #1 (Jan. 1998). Initially by the team of writer Scott Lobdell and penciller Alan Davis,  it went after three issues to writer Chris Claremont (co-writing with Lobdell for #4–5) and penciller Salvador Larroca; this team enjoyed a long run through issue #32 (Aug. 2000).2000sFollowing the run of Claremont, Lobdell and Larroca, Carlos Pacheco took over as penciller and co-writer, first with Rafael Marín, then with Marín and Jeph Loeb. This series began using dual numbering, as if the original Fantastic Four series had continued unbroken, with issue #42 / #471 (June 2001). At the time, the Marvel Comics series begun in the 1960s, such as Thor and The Amazing Spider-Man, were given such dual numbering on the front cover, with the present-day volume's numbering alongside the numbering from the original series. After issue #70 / #499 (Aug. 2003), the title reverted to its original vol. 1 numbering with issue #500 (Sept. 2003).Karl Kesel succeeded Loeb as co-writer with issue #51 / #480 (March 2002), and after a few issues with temporary teams, Mark Waid took over as writer with #60 / 489 (October 2002) with artist Mike Wieringo with Marvel releasing a promotional variant edition of their otherwise $2.25 debut issue at the price of nine cents US.   Pencillers Mark Buckingham, Casey Jones, and Howard Porter variously contributed through issue #524 (May 2005), with a handful of issues by other teams also during this time. Writer J. Michael Straczynski and penciller Mike McKone did issues #527–541 (July 2005 – Nov. 2006), with Dwayne McDuffie taking over as writer the following issue, and Paul Pelletier succeeding McKone beginning with #544 (May 2007).As a result of the events of the "Civil War" company-crossover storyline, the Black Panther and Storm temporarily replaced Reed and Susan Richards on the team. During that period, the Fantastic Four also appeared in Black Panther,   written by Reginald Hudlin and pencilled primarily by Francis Portela. Beginning with issue #554 (April 2008), writer Mark Millar and penciller Bryan Hitch began what Marvel announced as a sixteen-issue run.   Following the summer 2008 crossover storyline, "Secret Invasion", and the 2009 aftermath "Dark Reign", chronicling the U.S. government's assigning of the Nation's security functions to the seemingly reformed supervillain Norman Osborn, the Fantastic Four starred in a five-issue miniseries, Dark Reign: Fantastic Four (May–Sept. 2009), written by Jonathan Hickman, with art by Sean Chen.    Hickman took over as the series regular writer as of issue #570 with Dale Eaglesham  and later Steve Epting on art.2010sIn the storyline "Three", which concluded in Fantastic Four #587 (cover date March 2011, published January 26, 2011), the Human Torch appears to die stopping a horde of monsters from the other-dimensional Negative Zone. The series ended with the following issue, #588, and relaunched in March 2011 as simply FF.   The relaunch saw the team assume a new name, the Future Foundation, adopt new black-and-white costumes, and accept longtime ally Spider-Man as a member. In October 2011, with the publication of FF #11 (cover-dated Dec. 2011), the Fantastic Four series reached its 599th issue.In November 2011, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Fantastic Four and of Marvel Comics, the company published the 100-page Fantastic Four #600 (cover-dated Jan. 2012),  which returned the title to its original numbering and featured the return of the Human Torch. It revealed the fate of the character of Johnny Storm after issue #587, showing that while he did in fact die, he was resurrected to fight as a gladiator for the entertainment of Annihilus. Storm later formed a resistance force called Light Brigade and defeated Annihilus. Although it was launched as a continuation of the Fantastic Four title, FF continues publication as a separate series. Starting with issue #12, the title focuses upon the youthful members of the Future Foundation, including Franklin and Valeria Richards.In the graphic novel Fantastic Four:  Season One, the Fantastic Four is given an updated origin story set in the present day instead of the 1960s.    The hardcover compilation debuted at number four on The New York Times Best Seller list for graphic novels. As part of Marvel NOW! Fantastic Four ended with #611, ending Jonathan Hickman's long run on FF titles, and the title was relaunched in November 2012 with the creative team of writer Matt Fraction and artist Mark Bagley.   In the new title with its numbering starting at #1, the entire Fantastic Four family explore space together, with the hidden intent for Reed Richards to discover why his powers are fading.Writer James Robinson and artist Leonard Kirk launched a new Fantastic Four series in February 2014 (cover dated April 2014). Robinson later confirmed that Fantastic Four would be cancelled in 2015 with issue #645, saying that "The book is reverting to its original numbers, and the book is going away for a while. I'm moving towards the end of Fantastic Four. I just want to reassure people that you will not leave this book with a bad taste in your mouth."  In the aftermath of the "Secret Wars" storyline, the Thing is working with the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Human Torch is acting as an ambassador with the Inhumans.  With Franklin's powers restored and Reed having absorbed the power of the Beyonders from Doom, the Richards family is working on travelling through and reconstructing the multiverse,  but Peter Parker has purchased the Baxter Building to keep it "safe" until the team is ready to come back together. SpinoffsAncillary titles and features spun off from the flagship series include the 1970s quarterly Giant-Size Fantastic Four and the 1990s Fantastic Four Unlimited and Fantastic Four Unplugged; Fantastic Force, an 18-issue spinoff (November 1994 – April 1996) featuring an adult Franklin Richards, from a different timeline, as Psi-Lord. A 12-issue series Fantastic Four: The World's Greatest Comics Magazine ran in 2001, paying homage to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's legendary run. A spinoff title Marvel Knights 4 (April 2004 – August 2006) was written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and initially illustrated by Steve McNiven  in his first Marvel work. As well, there have been numerous limited series featuring the group.In 1996, Marvel launched Fantastic Four 2099. The series was part of the company's Marvel 2099 imprint, which explored an alternate future of the Marvel Universe. The four protagonists inexplicably find themselves in 2099, with the world believing them to be clones of the original members of the Fantastic Four. The series ran for 8 issues (Jan. – Aug. 1996), serving as a companion to Doom 2099—an original Marvel 2099 title which featured an individual claiming to be the original Victor von Doom.In 2004, Marvel launched Ultimate Fantastic Four. As part of the company's Ultimate Marvel imprint, the series re-imagined the team as teenagers.  The series ran for 60 issues (Feb. 2004 – Feb. 2009). In 2008, Marvel also launched Marvel Adventures: Fantastic Four, an out-of-continuity series aimed at younger readers.Although it was launched by Marvel as a continuation of the Fantastic Four title in 2011, FF continued publication as a separate series after the regular series resumed in 2012. From issues #12, the title focused upon the youthful members of the Future Foundation, including Franklin and Valeria Richards.  A second volume was launched as part of Marvel NOW! by Matt Fraction and Mike Allred depicting a substitute Fantastic Four team starring Scott Lang, Medusa, She-Hulk, and Ms. Thing.The Human Torch soloThe Human Torch was given a solo strip in Strange Tales in 1962 in order to bolster sales of the title.   The series began in Strange Tales #101 (October 1962), in 12- to 14-page stories plotted by Lee and initially scripted by his brother, Larry Lieber, and drawn by penciller Kirby and inker Dick Ayers.Here, Johnny was seen living with his older sister, Susan, in fictional Glenview, Long Island, New York, where he continued high school and, with youthful naiveté, attempted to maintain a "secret identity". In Strange Tales #106 (March 1963), Johnny discovered that his friends and neighbors knew of his dual identity all along, from Fantastic Four news reports, but were humoring him. Supporting characters included Johnny's girlfriend, Doris Evans, usually in consternation as Johnny cheerfully flew off to battle bad guys. She was seen again in a 1973 issue of Fantastic Four, having become a heavyset but cheerful wife and mother.  Ayers took over the penciling after ten issues, later followed by original Golden Age Human Torch creator Carl Burgos and others. The Fantastic Four made occasional cameo appearances, and the Thing became a co-star with issue #123 (Aug. 1964).The Human Torch shared the split book Strange Tales with fellow feature Doctor Strange for the majority of its run, before being replaced in issue #135 (August 1965) by Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.. The Silver Age stories were republished in 1974, along with some Golden Age Human Torch stories, in a short-lived ongoing Human Torch series.A later ongoing solo series in Marvel's manga-influenced Tsunami imprint, Human Torch, ran 12 issues (June 2003 – June 2004), followed by the five-issue limited series Spider-Man/Human Torch (March–July 2005), an untold tales team-up arc spanning the course of their friendship.The Thing soloThe Thing appeared in two team-up issues of Marvel Feature (#11–12, September–November 1973). Following their success, he was given his own regular team-up title Marvel Two-in-One, co-starring with Marvel heroes not only in the present day but occasionally in other time periods (fighting alongside the World War II-era Liberty Legion in #20 and the 1930s hero Doc Savage in #21, for example) and in alternate realities. The series ran 100 issues (January 1974 – June 1983), with seven summer annuals (1976–1982) and was immediately followed by the solo title The Thing #1–36 (July 1983 – June 1986). Another ongoing solo series, also titled The Thing, ran eight issues (January–August 2006).Characters  The Fantastic Four is formed after four civilian astronauts are exposed to cosmic rays during an unauthorized outer space test flight in an experimental rocket ship designed by Dr. Reed Richards. Pilot Ben Grimm and crew-members Susan Storm and her brother Johnny Storm survive an emergency crash-landing in a field on Earth. Upon exiting the rocket, the four discover they have developed incredible superpowers, and decide to use these powers to help others. In the first issue the crew talks about Reed Richards' rocketship flying to the stars. Stan Lee's original synopsis described the crew's plan to fly to Mars, but Lee later shortly afterward wrote that due to "the rate the Communists are progressing in space, maybe we better make this a flight to the STARS, instead of just to Mars, because by the time this mag goes on sale, the Russians may have already MADE a flight to Mars!" In a significant departure from preceding superhero conventions, the Fantastic Four make no effort to maintain secret identities or, until issue #3, to wear superhero costumes, instead maintaining a public profile and enjoying celebrity status for scientific and heroic contributions to society. At the same time, they are often prone to arguing and even fighting with one another. Despite their bickering, the Fantastic Four consistently prove themselves to be "a cohesive and formidable team in times of crisis."    While there have been a number of lineup changes to the group, the four characters who debuted in Fantastic Four #1 remain the core and most frequent lineup.Mister Fantastic (Reed Richards), a scientific genius, can stretch, twist and re-shape his body to inhuman proportions. Mr. Fantastic serves as the father figure of the group, and is "appropriately pragmatic, authoritative, and dull".   Richards blames himself for the failed space mission, particularly because of how the event transformed pilot Ben Grimm.   Stan Lee said the stretch powers were inspired by DC's Plastic Man, which had no equivalent in Marvel.   Invisible Girl/Invisible Woman (Susan Storm), Reed Richards' girlfriend (and eventual wife) has the ability to bend and manipulate light to render herself and others invisible. Stan Lee did not want Sue to have superstrength, "to be Wonder Woman and punch people", so eventually he came to invisibility, inspired by works such as The Invisible Man.  She later develops the ability to generate invisible force fields, which she uses for a variety of defensive and offensive effects.The Human Torch (Johnny Storm), Sue Storm's younger brother, possesses the ability to control fire, allowing him to project fire from his body, as well as the power to fly. This character was loosely based on a Human Torch character published by Marvel's predecessor Timely Comics in the 1940s, an android that could ignite itself. Lee said that when he conceptualized the character, "I thought it was a shame that we didn't have The Human Torch anymore, and this was a good chance to bring him back".   Unlike the teen sidekicks that preceded him, the Human Torch in the early stories was "a typical adolescent — brash, rebellious, and affectionately obnoxious."   Johnny Storm was killed in the 2011 storyline "Three",  before being brought back and rejoining the reformed Fantastic Four.   The Thing (Ben Grimm), Reed Richards' college roommate and best friend, has been transformed into a monstrous, orange, rock-like humanoid possessing high levels of superhuman strength and durability.  The Thing is often filled with anger, self-loathing and self-pity over his new existence. He serves as "an uncle figure, a long-term friend of the family with a gruff Brooklyn manner, short temper, and caustic sense of humor".   In the original synopsis Lee gave to Kirby, The Thing was intended as "the heavy", but over the years, the character has become "the most lovable group member: honest, direct and free of pretension".   Lee said his original pitch to Kirby stated that The Thing was "someone who turned into a monster" and is bitter because unlike the other three he cannot change back to a normal appearance. The Fantastic Four has had several different headquarters, most notably the Baxter Building, located at 42nd Street and Madison Avenue  in New York City. The Baxter Building was replaced by Four Freedoms Plaza at the same location after its destruction at the hands of Kristoff Vernard, adopted son of the team's seminal foe Doctor Doom. (Prior to the completion of Four Freedoms Plaza, the team took up temporary residence at Avengers Mansion.)  Pier 4, a waterfront warehouse, served as a temporary headquarters after Four Freedoms Plaza was destroyed by the ostensible superhero team the Thunderbolts  shortly after the revelation that they were actually the supervillain team the Masters of Evil in disguise. Pier 4 was eventually destroyed during a battle with the longtime Fantastic Four supervillain Diablo,   after which the team received a new Baxter Building, courtesy of one of team leader Reed Richards' former professors, Noah Baxter. This second Baxter Building was constructed in Earth's orbit and teleported into the vacant lot formerly occupied by the original. Supporting charactersAllies and supporting charactersA number of characters are closely affiliated with the team, share complex personal histories with one or more of its members but have never actually held an official membership. Some of these characters include, but are not limited to: Namor the Sub-Mariner (previously an antagonist), Alicia Masters,  Lyja the Lazerfist, H.E.R.B.I.E., Kristoff Vernard (Doctor Doom's former protégé), Wyatt Wingfoot,  Sue and Johnny's father Franklin Storm, the receptionist android Roberta, governess Agatha Harkness,  and Reed and Sue's children Franklin Richards  and Valeria Richards.Several allies of the Fantastic Four have served as temporary members of the team, including Crystal, Medusa,  Power Man (Luke Cage), Nova (Frankie Raye),    She-Hulk, Ms. Marvel (Sharon Ventura), Ant-Man (Scott Lang), Namorita, Storm, and the Black Panther. A temporary lineup from Fantastic Four #347–349 (December 1990 – February 1991) consisted of the Hulk (in his "Joe Fixit" persona), Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch). Other notable characters who have been involved with the Fantastic Four include Alyssa Moy, Caledonia (Alysande Stuart of Earth-9809), Fantastic Force, the Inhumans  (particularly the royal family members Black Bolt, Crystal, Medusa, Gorgon, Karnak, Triton, and Lockjaw), Reed's father Nathaniel Richards, the Silver Surfer (previously an antagonist), Thundra, postal worker Willie Lumpkin, Baxter Building landlord Walter Collins, the Thing's rivals the Yancy Street Gang and Uatu the Watcher.Author Christopher Knowles states that Kirby's work on creations such as the Inhumans and the Black Panther served as "a showcase of some of the most radical concepts in the history of the medium".   Antagonists Writers and artists over many years have created a variety of characters to challenge the Fantastic Four. Knowles states that Kirby helped to create "an army of villains whose rage and destructive power had never been seen before," and "whose primary impulse is to smash the world."  Some of the team's oldest and most frequent enmities have involved such foes as the Mole Man, the Skrulls,  Namor the Sub-Mariner, Doctor Doom, the Puppet Master, Kang the Conqueror/Rama-Tut/Immortus, Blastaar, the Frightful Four,  Annihilus,  Galactus, and Klaw. Other prominent antagonists of the Fantastic Four have included the Wizard, the Impossible Man,  the Red Ghost and the Super-Apes,  the Mad Thinker, the Super-Skrull, the Molecule Man,  Diablo, Dragon Man,  Psycho-Man, Ronan the Accuser, Salem's Seven, Terrax the Tamer, Terminus, Hyperstorm and Lucia von Bardas.Cultural impactThe Fantastic Four's characterization was initially different from all other superheroes at the time. One major difference is that they do not conceal their identities, leading the public to be both suspicious and in awe of them. Also, they frequently argued and disagreed with each other, hindering their work as a team.  Described as "heroes with hangups" by Stan Lee,    the Thing has a temper, and the Human Torch resents being a child among adults. Mr. Fantastic blames himself for the Thing's transformation. Social scientist Bradford W. Wright describes the team as a "volatile mix of human emotions and personalities". In spite of their disagreements, they ultimately function well as a team. The first issue of The Fantastic Four proved a success, igniting a new direction for superhero comics and soon influencing many other superhero comics.  Readers grew fond of Ben's grumpiness, Johnny's tendency to annoy others and Reed and Sue's spats. Stan Lee was surprised at the reaction to the first issue, leading him to stay in the comics field despite previous plans to leave. Comics historian Stephen Krensky said that "Lee's natural dialogue and flawed characters appealed to 1960s kids looking to 'get real'".   As of 2005, 150 million comics featuring the Fantastic Four had been sold. In other mediaThere have been four The Fantastic Four animated TV series and three released feature films. The Fantastic Four also guest-starred in the "Secret Wars" story arc of the 1990s Spider-Man animated series, and the Thing guest-starred (with a small cameo from the other Fantastic Four members) in the "Fantastic Fortitude" episode of the 1996 The Incredible Hulk series. The Fantastic Four also appeared in the 2012 series The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes.There was a short-lived radio show in 1975 that adapted early Lee/Kirby stories  and is notable for casting a pre-Saturday Night Live Bill Murray as the Human Torch. Also in the cast were Bob Maxwell as Reed Richards, Cynthia Adler as Sue Storm, Jim Pappas as Ben Grimm and Jerry Terheyden as Doctor Doom. Other Marvel characters featured in the series included Ant-Man, Prince Namor, Nick Fury and the Hulk. Stan Lee narrated the series and the scripts were taken almost verbatim from the comic books. The radio show was packaged into five-minute segments, with five segments comprising a complete adventure.    The team appeared on the Power Records album Fantastic Four: "The Way It Began" book and record set, an audio dramatization of Fantastic Four #126. TelevisionThe Fantastic Four has been the subject of four animated television series. The first, Fantastic Four, produced by Hanna-Barbera,  ran 20 episodes on ABC from September 9, 1967 to March 15, 1970. The second Fantastic Four series, produced by DePatie-Freleng, ran 13 episodes from September 9, 1978, to December 16, 1978; this series features a H.E.R.B.I.E. Unit in place of the Human Torch. The third Fantastic Four was broadcast as part of The Marvel Action Hour umbrella, with introductions by Stan Lee. This series ran 26 episodes from September 24, 1994 to February 24, 1996. The fourth series, Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes, debuted on September 2, 2006, on Cartoon Network and ran for 26 episodes.In 1979, the Thing was featured as half of the Saturday morning cartoon Fred and Barney Meet the Thing. The character of the Thing received a radical make-over for the series. The title character for this program was Benjy Grimm, a teenage boy who possessed a pair of magic Thing-rings which could transform him into the Thing when he put them together and said "Thing-ring, do your thing!" The other members of the Fantastic Four do not appear in the series, nor do the animated The Flintstones stars Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble, despite the title of the program. Different Fantastic Four members appear briefly and with little or no dialogue and are mentioned various times throughout the first season of The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes. The most expansive appearances are in the episode "The Private War of Doctor Doom", in which the Avengers team up with the Fantastic Four to battle the titular supervillain, and in the final episode of season two, in which the groups team up to battle Galactus. The Thing becomes a member of the New Avengers in episode 23 of season 2.The Fantastic Four appear in the Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. episode "Monster No More."  The Agents of S.M.A.S.H. assist the Fantastic Four in thwarting the Tribbitite Invasion.Film A film adaptation of the characters, The Fantastic Four, was completed in 1994 by producer Roger Corman. The film was not released to theaters or on home video, but it has since been made available through bootleg video distributors. It was made because Constantin Film owned the film rights and would have lost them if it failed to begin production by a certain deadline, a tactic known as creating an ashcan copy.    According to producer Bernd Eichinger, Avi Arad had Marvel purchase the film for a few million dollars. In 2005, the second film adaptation, Fantastic Four directed by Tim Story, was released by 20th Century Fox. Despite mixed reviews from critics, it earned US$155 million in North America and $330 million worldwide.   The sequel, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, directed by Story and written by Don Payne, was released in 2007. Despite mixed-to-negative reviews, the sequel earned $132 million in North America and a total of $330.6 million worldwide.  Both films feature Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards / Mr. Fantastic, Jessica Alba as Susan Storm / Invisible Woman, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm / Human Torch, Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm / The Thing, and Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom / Dr. Doom. Stan Lee makes cameo appearances as the mailman Willie Lumpkin in the first film and as himself in the second film.A reboot directed by Josh Trank (also titled Fantastic Four, but stylized as Fant4stic) was released on August 7, 2015.  The film stars Miles Teller as Reed Richards, Kate Mara as Sue Storm, Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm, Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm and Toby Kebbell as Doctor Doom.    It is based on Ultimate Fantastic Four.  It earned poor reviews and box office results. Video gamesIn 1985, the Fantastic Four starred in Questprobe #3 The Fantastic Four, an adventure game from Adventure International for the Atari 8-bit series. In 1997, the group starred in the Fantastic Four video game. The team appeared in the Spider-Man: The Animated Series video game, based on the 1990s Spider-Man animated series, for the Super NES and Sega Genesis. The Thing and the Human Torch appeared in the 2005 game Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects.All of the Fantastic Four appear as playable characters in the game Marvel: Ultimate Alliance with Doctor Doom being the main enemy. The members of the Fantastic Four are also featured in Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2, although the team is separated over the course of the game, with Mister Fantastic being 'locked' into the Pro-Registration side of the game's storyline and the Thing briefly becoming unavailable to the player- just as he left America in protest of the war- until he returns to assist in preventing civilian casualties during the conflict.The Human Torch has an appearance in a mini-game where the player races against him in all versions of Ultimate Spider-Man, except on the Game Boy Advance platform. The Fantastic Four star in tie-in videogames based on the 2005 film Fantastic Four and its sequel. The Fantastic Four are also playable characters in Marvel Heroes and Lego Marvel Super Heroes.The Fantastic Four starred in their own virtual pinball game Fantastic Four for Pinball FX 2 released by Zen Studios.

Filtration<====>11665<====>Filtration  Filtration is any of various mechanical, physical or biological operations that separate solids from fluids (liquids or gases) by adding a medium through which only the fluid can pass.  The fluid that passes through is called the filtrate.   In physical filters oversize solids in the fluid are retained and in biological filters particulates are trapped and ingested and metabolites are retained and removed.   However, the separation is not complete; solids will be contaminated with some fluid and filtrate will contain fine particles (depending on the pore size, filter thickness and biological activity).  Filtration occurs both in nature and in engineered systems; there are biological, geological, and industrial forms. 

Follies<====>11668<====>Follies  Follies is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by James Goldman.   The story concerns a reunion in a crumbling Broadway theatre, scheduled for demolition, of the past performers of the "Weismann's Follies," a musical revue (based on the Ziegfeld Follies), that played in that theatre between the World Wars.   It focuses on two couples, Buddy and Sally Durant Plummer and Benjamin and Phyllis Rogers Stone, who are attending the reunion.  Sally and Phyllis were showgirls in the Follies.  Both couples are deeply unhappy with their marriages. 

Functional theories of grammar<====>11669<====>Functional theories of grammar Functional theories of grammar are those approaches to the study of language that see functionality of language and its elements to be the key to understanding linguistic processes and structures.  Functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, it is reasonable to assume that its structures are best analyzed and understood with reference to the functions they carry out.  Functional theories of grammar differ from structural linguistics or formalist language theories, in that the latter approaches seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other only as systems of formal rules or operations, whereas the former additionally takes into account the context where linguistic elements are used and studies the way they are instrumentally useful or functional in the given environment. 

Fick's laws of diffusion<====>11671<====>Fick's laws of diffusion  Fick's laws of diffusion describe diffusion and were derived by Adolf Fick in 1855.  They can be used to solve for the diffusion coefficient, D.  Fick's first law can be used to derive his second law which in turn is identical to the diffusion equation. Fick's first lawFick's first law relates the diffusive flux to the concentration under the assumption of steady state.  It postulates that the flux goes from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration, with a magnitude that is proportional to the concentration gradient (spatial derivative), or in simplistic terms the concept that a solute will move from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration across a concentration gradient. 

Far East<====>11672<====>Far East  The Far East is an alternate geographical term in English (with equivalents in many other languages – see the infobox on the right for examples), that usually refers to East Asia (including Northeast Asia), the Russian Far East (part of North Asia), and Southeast Asia.   South Asia is sometimes also included for economic and cultural reasons.  Since the 1960s, East Asia has become the most common term for the region in international mass media outlets.   Reischauer, Edwin and John K Fairbank, East Asia: The Great Tradition, 1960.   Far East is often deprecated as archaic and Eurocentric, along with the terms "Near East" and "Middle East". 

Fawlty Towers<====>11673<====>Fawlty Towers    Fawlty Towers is  a British television sitcom broadcast on BBC Two in 1975 and 1979.  Only 12 episodes were made (two series of six episodes each).  The show was created and written by John Cleese and  Connie Booth, who also starred in the show.  They were married at the time of series 1, but divorced before recording series 2.  The show was ranked first on a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000. The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay on the "English Riviera". 

False friend<====>11675<====>False friend  False friends are words in two languages that look or sound similar, but differ significantly in meaning.  An example is the English embarrassed and the Spanish embarazada (which means pregnant), or the word sensible, which means reasonable in English, but sensitive in French and Spanish.  Another example is the root L-H-M in Semitic languages; while "Lekhem" in Hebrew and "Laham" in Syriac mean "bread", "Lahem" in Arabic is "meat". The term is a shortened version of the expression "false friend of a translator", the French version of which (faux amis du traducteur) was introduced by linguists Maxime Kœssler and Jules Derocquigny in 1928,  in the book Les Faux Amis ou les trahisons du vocabulaire anglais  (False Friends, or the Pitfalls of the English Vocabulary, with a sequel, Autres Mots anglais perfides). 

False cognate<====>11676<====>False cognate False cognates are pairs of words that seem to be cognates because of similar sounds and meaning, but have different etymologies; they can be within the same language or from different languages.   For example, the English word dog and the Mbabaram word dog have the exact same meaning, but by complete coincidence.  This is different from false friends, which are similar-sounding words with different meanings, but which may in fact be etymologically related.  (For example: Spanish dependiente looks like dependent, but means employee as well. )Even though false cognates lack a common root, there may still be an indirect connection between them (for example by phono-semantic matching or folk etymology). 

Fundamental analysis<====>11684<====>Fundamental analysis  Fundamental analysis, in accounting and finance, is the analysis of a business's financial statements (usually to analyze the business's assets, liabilities, and earnings); health;  and its competitors and markets.  When applied to futures and forex, it focuses on the overall state of the economy, and considers factors including interest rates, production, earnings, employment, GDP, housing, manufacturing and management.  When analyzing a stock, futures contract, or currency using fundamental analysis, there are two basic approaches that can be used: bottom up analysis and top down analysis.   These terms are used to distinguish such analysis from other types of investment analysis, such as quantitative and technical. 

Frasier<====>11685<====>Frasier   Frasier is an American sitcom that was broadcast on NBC for eleven seasons, premiering on September 16, 1993, and concluding on May 13, 2004.  The program was created and produced by David Angell, Peter Casey, and David Lee (as Grub Street Productions) in association with Grammnet (2004) and Paramount Network Television.  The series was created as a spin-off of Cheers,  continuing the story of psychiatrist Frasier Crane as he returned to his hometown of Seattle and started building a new life.  Frasier stars Kelsey Grammer, David Hyde Pierce, John Mahoney, Jane Leeves, and Peri Gilpin. 

Fantasy Games Unlimited<====>11690<====>Fantasy Games Unlimited Fantasy Games Unlimited (FGU) is a publishing house for both table-top and role-playing games.  The company has no in-house design teams and relies on submitted material from outside talent.    HistoryFounded in the summer of 1975 by Scott B.  Bizar, the company's first publications were the wargames Gladiators and Royal Armies of the Hyborean Age.  Upon the sudden appearance and massive popularity of Dungeons & Dragons from TSR, the company turned its attentions to role-playing games, seeking out and producing systems created by amateurs and freelancers.  Rather than focusing on any one line and supporting it with subsequent supplements, FGU produced a continuous stream of new games. 

Functional decomposition<====>11691<====>Functional decompositionIn mathematics, functional decomposition is the process of resolving a functional relationship into its constituent parts in such a way that the original function can be reconstructed (i. e. , recomposed) from those parts by function composition.  This process of decomposition may be undertaken to gain insight into the identity of the constituent components which may reflect individual physical processes of interest.  Also functional decomposition may result in a compressed representation of the global function, a task which is feasible only when the constituent processes possess a certain level of modularity (i. e. , independence or non-interaction).

Franz Boas<====>11698<====>Franz Boas  Franz Uri Boas ( ;  ; July 9, 1858 December 21, 1942)  was a German-American  anthropologist and a pioneer of modern anthropology who has been called the "Father of American Anthropology".    His work is associated with the movement of anthropological historicism.  Studying in Germany, Boas was awarded a doctorate in 1881 in physics while also studying geography.  He then participated in a geographical expedition to northern Canada, where he became fascinated with the culture and language of the Baffin Island Inuit.  He went on to do field work with the indigenous cultures and languages of the Pacific Northwest. 

Franz Bopp<====>11699<====>Franz Bopp  Franz Bopp (14 September 1791 – 23 October 1867)  was a German linguist known for extensive and pioneering comparative work on Indo-European languages. Early lifeHe was born in Mainz, but the political disarray of the time made his parents move to Aschaffenburg, the second seat of the Archbishop of Mainz.  There, he received a liberal education at the Lyceum, and Karl Joseph Hieronymus Windischmann drew his attention to the languages and literature of the East (Windischmann, along with Georg Friedrich Creuzer, Johann Joseph von Görres, and the brothers Schlegel, expressed great enthusiasm for Indian wisdom and philosophy). 

Full Metal Jacket<====>11701<====>Full Metal Jacket  Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 British-American war film directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick.  The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979).  Its storyline follows a platoon of U. S.  Marines through their training, primarily focusing on two privates, Joker and Pyle, who struggle to get through camp under their foul-mouthed drill instructor, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, and the experiences of two of the platoon's Marines in the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam War.  The film's title refers to the full metal jacket bullet used by soldiers. 

Flirting<====>11702<====>Flirting  Flirting or coquetry is a social and sometimes sexual behavior involving verbal or written communication, as well as body language, by one person to another, either to suggest interest in a deeper relationship with the other person, or if done playfully, for amusement.  In most cultures, it is socially disapproved for a person to make explicit sexual advances in public, or in private to someone not romantically acquainted, but indirect or suggestive advances (i. e.  flirting) may at times be considered acceptable. Flirting usually involves speaking and behaving in a way that suggests a mildly greater intimacy than the actual relationship between the parties would justify, though within the rules of social etiquette, which generally disapproves of a direct expression of sexual interest in the given setting. 

Franklin J. Schaffner<====>11705<====>Franklin J.  Schaffner  Franklin James Schaffner (May 30, 1920 July 2, 1989) was an American film director best known for the films Planet of the Apes (1968), Patton (1970), Nicholas and Alexandra (1971), Papillon (1973), and The Boys from Brazil (1978). Early lifeSchaffner was born in Tokyo, Japan, the son of American missionaries Sarah Horting (née Swords) and Paul Franklin Schaffner,   and was raised in Japan.  He returned to the United States and graduated from Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he was active in drama.  He studied law at Columbia University in New York City but his education was interrupted by service with the United States Navy in World War II during which he served with American amphibious forces in Europe and North Africa. 

False etymology<====>11709<====>False etymologyA false etymology (popular etymology, etymythology,    pseudo-etymology, or par(a)etymology), sometimes called folk etymology – although the latter is also a technical term in linguistics - is a popularly held but false belief about the origin or derivation of a specific word. Such etymologies often have the feel of urban legends, and can be much more colorful and fanciful than the typical etymologies found in dictionaries, often involving stories of unusual practices in particular subcultures (e. g.  Oxford students from non-noble families being supposedly forced to write sine nobilitate by their name, soon abbreviated to s. 

Finch<====>11711<====>Finch  The true finches are small to medium-sized passerine birds in the family Fringillidae.  Finches have stout conical bills adapted for eating seeds and often have colourful plumage.  They occupy a great range of habitats where they are usually resident and do not migrate.  They have a worldwide distribution except for Australia and the polar regions.  The family includes species known as siskins, canaries, redpolls, serins, grosbeaks and euphonias.  Many birds in other families are also commonly called "finches", including some species in the very similar-looking waxbills or estrildid finches (family Estrildidae) of the Old World tropics and Australia; several groups of the bunting and American sparrow family (Emberizidae); and the Darwin's finches of the Galapagos islands, now considered members of the tanager family (Thraupidae). 

Facilitated diffusion<====>11712<====>Facilitated diffusion Facilitated diffusion (also known as facilitated transport or passive-mediated transport) is the process of spontaneous passive transport (as opposed to active transport) of molecules or ions across a biological membrane via specific transmembrane integral proteins. Being passive, facilitated transport does not directly require chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis in the transport step itself; rather, molecules and ions move down their concentration gradient reflecting its diffusive nature. Facilitated diffusion is different from free diffusion in several ways.  First, the transport relies on molecular binding between the cargo and the membrane-embedded channel or carrier protein. 

McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle<====>11715<====>McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle  The McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle is an American twin-engine, all-weather tactical fighter aircraft designed by McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) to gain and maintain air supremacy in aerial combat.    Following reviews of proposals, the United States Air Force selected McDonnell Douglas' design in 1967 to meet the service's need for a dedicated air superiority fighter.  The Eagle first flew in July 1972, and entered service in 1976.  It is among the most successful modern fighters, with over 100 victories and no losses in aerial combat, with the majority of the kills by the Israeli Air Force. 

Grumman F-14 Tomcat<====>11719<====>Grumman F-14 Tomcat  The Grumman F-14 Tomcat is an American supersonic, twin-engine, two-seat, variable-sweep wing fighter aircraft.  The Tomcat was developed for the United States Navy's Naval Fighter Experimental (VFX) program after the collapse of the F-111B project.  The F-14 was the first of the American teen-series fighters, which were designed incorporating air combat experience against MiG fighters during the Vietnam War. The F-14 first flew in December 1970 and made its first deployment in 1974 with the U. S.  Navy aboard  , replacing the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II.  The F-14 served as the U. 

Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk<====>11720<====>Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk  The Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk is an American single-seat, twin-engine stealth attack aircraft that was developed by Lockheed's secretive Skunk Works division and operated by the United States Air Force (USAF).  The F-117 was based on the Have Blue technology demonstrator. The Nighthawk was the first operational aircraft to be designed around stealth technology.  Its maiden flight took place in 1981, and the aircraft achieved initial operating capability status in 1983.   The Nighthawk was shrouded in secrecy until it was revealed to the public in 1988.  Of the 64 F-117s built, 59 were production versions, with the other five being demonstrators/prototypes. 

Vought F4U Corsair<====>11721<====>Vought F4U Corsair  The Vought F4U Corsair is an American fighter aircraft that saw service primarily in World War II and the Korean War.  Demand for the aircraft soon overwhelmed Vought's manufacturing capability, resulting in production by Goodyear and Brewster: Goodyear-built Corsairs were designated FG and Brewster-built aircraft F3A.  From the first prototype delivery to the U. S.  Navy in 1940, to final delivery in 1953 to the French, 12,571 F4U Corsairs were manufactured, Shettle 2001, p.  107.   in 16 separate models, in the longest production run of any piston-engined fighter in U. 

Freddy Heineken<====>11723<====>Freddy Heineken Alfred Henry "Freddy" Heineken (4 November 1923 – 3 January 2002) was a Dutch businessman for Heineken International, the brewing company bought in 1864 by his grandfather Gerard Adriaan Heineken in Amsterdam.  He served as Chairman of the Board of directors and CEO from 1971 until 1989.  After his retirement as chairman and CEO, Heineken continued to sit on the board of directors until his death and served as chairman of the Supervisory board from 1989 till 1995.  At the time of his death, Heineken was one of the richest people in the Netherlands, with a net worth of 9. 

International Formula 3000<====>11724<====>International Formula 3000   The Formula 3000 International Championship was a motor racing series created by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) in 1985 to become the final preparatory step for drivers hoping to enter the Formula One championship.  Formula Two had become too expensive, and was dominated by works-run cars with factory engines; the hope was that Formula 3000 would offer quicker, cheaper, more open racing.  The series began as an open specification, then tyres were standardized from 1986 onwards, followed by engines and chassis in 1996.  The series ran annually until 2004, and was replaced in 2005 by the GP2 Series. 

Flunitrazepam<====>11725<====>Flunitrazepam   Flunitrazepam, also known as Rohypnol among other names,  is an intermediate acting benzodiazepine used in some countries to treat severe insomnia and in fewer, early in anesthesia.    Just as with other hypnotics, flunitrazepam should be strictly used only on a short-term basis or by those with chronic insomnia on an occasional basis.   Flunitrazepam has been referred to as a date rape drug even though its incidence is very rare in reported rape cases.  European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction Benzodiazepines drug profile.  Page last updated January 8, 2015 UseIn countries where the drug is still used, it is used for treatment of insomnia, and in some countries to begin anesthesia as well;   these were also the indications in which it was originally studied. 

Fuel cell<====>11729<====>Fuel cell  A fuel cell is an electrochemical cell that converts the chemical energy from a fuel into electricity through an electrochemical reaction of hydrogen fuel with oxygen or another oxidizing agent.   Fuel cells are different from batteries in requiring a continuous source of fuel and oxygen (usually from air) to sustain the chemical reaction, whereas in a battery the chemical energy comes from chemicals already present in the battery.  Fuel cells can produce electricity continuously for as long as fuel and oxygen are supplied. The first fuel cells were invented in 1838.  The first commercial use of fuel cells came more than a century later in NASA space programs to generate power for satellites and space capsules. 

Finlandization<====>11732<====>Finlandization  Finlandization ( ;  ;  ) is the process by which one powerful country makes a smaller neighboring country abide by the former's foreign policy rules, while allowing it to keep its nominal independence and its own political system.   The term means "to become like Finland" referring to the influence of the Soviet Union on Finland's policies during the Cold War. The term is generally considered pejorative, originating in West German political debate of the late 1960s and 1970s.  As the term was used in Germany and other NATO countries, it referred to the decision of a country not to challenge a more powerful neighbour in foreign politics, while maintaining national sovereignty. 

Fred Singer<====>11734<====>Fred Singer Siegfried Fred Singer (born September 27, 1924) is an Austrian-born American physicist and emeritus professor of environmental science at the University of Virginia.

Frederik Pohl<====>11736<====>Frederik Pohl   Frederik George Pohl Jr.  ( ; November 26, 1919 – September 2, 2013) was an American science-fiction writer, editor, and fan, with a career spanning more than 75 years—from his first published work, the 1937 poem "Elegy to a Dead Satellite: Luna", to the 2011 novel All the Lives He Led and articles and essays published in 2012.  From about 1959 until 1969, Pohl edited Galaxy and its sister magazine If; the latter won three successive annual Hugo Awards as the year's best professional magazine.   His 1977 novel Gateway won four "year's best novel" awards: the Hugo voted by convention participants, the Locus voted by magazine subscribers, the Nebula voted by American science-fiction writers, and the juried academic John W. 

Forrest J Ackerman<====>11740<====>Forrest J Ackerman Forrest J Ackerman   (born Forrest James Ackerman; November 24, 1916 – December 4, 2008) was an American magazine editor, science fiction writer and literary agent, a founder of science fiction fandom, a leading expert on science fiction, horror, and fantasy films,  and acknowledged as the world's most avid collector of genre books and movie memorabilia.   He was based in  Los Angeles, California. During his career as a literary agent, Ackerman represented such science fiction authors as Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov, A. E.  Van Vogt, Curt Siodmak and L.  Ron Hubbard. 

Fantasy film<====>11741<====>Fantasy film   Fantasy films are films that belong to the fantasy genre with fantastic themes, usually magic, supernatural events, mythology, folklore, or exotic fantasy worlds.  The genre is considered a form of speculative fiction alongside science fiction films and horror films, although the genres do overlap.  Fantasy films often have an element of magic, myth, wonder, escapism, and the extraordinary.  SubgenresSeveral sub-categories of fantasy films can be identified, although the delineations between these subgenres, much as in fantasy literature, are somewhat fluid. The most common fantasy subgenres depicted in movies are High Fantasy and Sword and Sorcery. 

Finite set<====>11742<====>Finite setIn mathematics, a finite set is a set that has a   number of elements.   Informally, a finite set is a set which one could in principle count and finish counting.  For example, \{2,4,6,8,10\} is a finite set with five elements.  The number of elements of a finite set is a natural number (a non-negative integer) and is called the cardinality of the set.  A set that is not finite is called infinite.  For example, the set of all positive integers is infinite: \{1,2,3,\ldots\}.  Finite sets are particularly important in combinatorics, the mathematical study of counting. 

Farmer Giles of Ham<====>11745<====>Farmer Giles of HamFarmer Giles of Ham is a comic Medieval fable written by J.  R.  R.  Tolkien in 1937 and published in 1949.  The story describes the encounters between Farmer Giles and a wily dragon named Chrysophylax, and how Giles manages to use these to rise from humble beginnings to rival the king of the land.  It is cheerfully anachronistic and light-hearted, set in Britain in an imaginary period of the Dark Ages, and featuring mythical creatures, medieval knights, and primitive firearms.  It is only tangentially connected with the author's Middle-earth legendarium:  both were originally intended as essays in "English mythology".

List of freshwater aquarium plant species<====>11753<====>List of freshwater aquarium plant speciesAquatic plants are used to give the freshwater aquarium a natural appearance, oxygenate the water, absorb ammonia, and provide habitat for fish, especially fry (babies) and for invertebrates.  Some aquarium fish and invertebrates also eat live plants.  Hobbyists use aquatic plants for aquascaping, of several aesthetic styles. Most of these plant species are found either partially or fully submerged in their natural habitat.  Although there are a handful of obligate aquatic plants that must be grown entirely underwater, most can grow fully emersed if the soil is moist.  Though some are just living at the water margins, still, they can live in the completely submerged habitat.

Air Force, and by the mid-1960s had become a major part of their air wings.  The Phantom is a large fighter with a top speed of over Mach 2. 

McDonnell FH Phantom<====>11761<====>McDonnell FH Phantom The McDonnell FH Phantom was a twin-engined jet fighter aircraft designed and first flown during World War II for the United States Navy.  The Phantom was the first purely jet-powered aircraft to land on an American aircraft carrier The first aircraft to land on an American carrier under jet power was the unconventional composite propeller-jet Ryan FR Fireball, designed to utilize its piston engine during takeoff and landing.  On 6 November 1945, the piston engine of an FR-1 failed on final approach; the pilot started the jet engine and landed, thereby performing the first jet-powered carrier landing, albeit unintentionally. 

Fricative consonant<====>11762<====>Fricative consonant  Fricatives are consonants produced by forcing air through a narrow channel made by placing two articulators close together.  These may be the lower lip against the upper teeth, in the case of  ; the back of the tongue against the soft palate, in the case of German   (the final consonant of Bach); or the side of the tongue against the molars, in the case of Welsh   (appearing twice in the name Llanelli).  This turbulent airflow is called frication.   A particular subset of fricatives are the sibilants.  When forming a sibilant, one still is forcing air through a narrow channel, but in addition, the tongue is curled lengthwise to direct the air over the edge of the teeth. 

Frost<====>11763<====>Frost Frost is the coating or deposit of ice that may form in humid air in cold conditions, usually overnight.   In temperate climates, it most commonly appears as fragile white crystals or frozen dew drops near the ground, but in cold climates, it occurs in a greater variety of forms.Frost is composed of delicate, branched patterns of ice crystals that formed as the result of fractal process development. The formation of frost is an indication that the air temperature has fallen below the freezing point of water, and plants that have evolved in warmer climates are known to suffer damage when the temperature falls low enough to freeze the water in the cells that make up the plant tissue. 

Franz Schmidt<====>11768<====>Franz Schmidt Franz Schmidt (22 December 1874 11 February 1939) was an Austrian composer, cellist and pianist.

Finnish Civil War<====>11772<====>Finnish Civil War    The Finnish Civil War  (27 January – 15 May 1918;  ;  ;  ;  ) concerned leadership and control of Finland during the transition from a Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire to an independent state.  The conflict formed a part of the national, political, and social turmoil caused by World War I (Eastern Front) in Europe.  The war was fought between the Reds, led by the Social Democratic Party, and the Whites, conducted by the non-socialist, conservative-based Senate.  The paramilitary Red Guards, composed of industrial and agrarian workers, controlled the cities and industrial centers of southern Finland. 

Flynn effect<====>11773<====>Flynn effect The Flynn effect is the substantial and long-sustained increase in both fluid and crystallized intelligence test scores measured in many parts of the world from roughly 1930 to the present day.   When intelligence quotient (IQ) tests are initially standardized using a sample of test-takers, by convention the average of the test results is set to 100 and their standard deviation is set to 15 or 16 IQ points.  When IQ tests are revised, they are again standardized using a new sample of test-takers, usually born more recently than the first.  Again, the average result is set to 100. 

Field ion microscope<====>11774<====>Field ion microscope The Field ion microscope (FIM) was invented by Müller in 1951   It is a type of microscope that can be used to image the arrangement of atoms at the surface of a sharp metal tip. On October 11, 1955, Erwin Müller and his Ph. D.  student, Kanwar Bahadur (Pennsylvania State University) observed individual tungsten atoms on the surface of a sharply pointed tungsten tip by cooling it to 21 K and employing helium as the imaging gas.  Müller & Bahadur were the first persons to observe individual atoms directly.  IntroductionIn FIM, a sharp ( −5  to 10 −3  Torr). 

First Battle of El Alamein<====>11775<====>First Battle of El Alamein  The First Battle of El Alamein (1–27 July 1942) was a battle of the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War, fought in Egypt between Axis forces (Germany and Italy) of the Panzer Army Africa (Panzerarmee Afrika, which included the Afrika Korps) (Field Marshal (Generalfeldmarschall) Erwin Rommel) and Allied (British Imperial and Commonwealth) forces (Britain, British India, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand) of the Eighth Army (General Claude Auchinleck). The British prevented a second advance by the Axis forces into Egypt.  Axis positions near El Alamein, only   from Alexandria, were dangerously close to the ports and cities of Egypt, the base facilities of the Commonwealth forces and the Suez Canal. 

First Italo-Ethiopian War<====>11776<====>First Italo-Ethiopian War   The First Italo-Ethiopian War was fought between Italy and Ethiopia from 1895 to 1896.  It originated from a disputed treaty which, the Italians claimed, turned the country into an Italian protectorate.  Italy was supported by the two other triple alliance members Germany and Austria.  Much to their surprise, they found that Ethiopian ruler Menelik II, rather than being opposed by some of his traditional enemies, was supported by them, so the Italian army, invading Ethiopia from Italian Eritrea in 1893, faced a more united front than they expected.  In addition, Ethiopia was supported by Russia, an Orthodox Christian nation like Ethiopia  with military advisers, army training, and the sale of weapons for Ethiopian forces during the war. 

Frederick Soddy<====>11778<====>Frederick Soddy   Frederick Soddy FRS  (2 September 1877 – 22 September 1956) was an English radiochemist who explained, with Ernest Rutherford, that radioactivity is due to the transmutation of elements, now known to involve nuclear reactions.  He also proved the existence of isotopes of certain radioactive elements. BiographySoddy was born at 5 Bolton Road, Eastbourne, England.  He went to school at Eastbourne College, before going on to study at University College of Wales at Aberystwyth and at Merton College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1898 with first class honors in chemistry. 

Fur seal<====>11780<====>Fur seal   Fur seals are any of nine species of pinnipeds belonging to the Arctocephalinae subfamily in the Otariidae family.  They are much more closely related to sea lions than true seals, and share with them external ears  (pinnae), relatively long and muscular foreflippers, and the ability to walk on all fours.   They are marked by their dense underfur, which made them a long-time object of commercial hunting.  Eight species belong to the Arctocephalus genus and are found primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, while one ninth species also sometimes called fur seal, the northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus), belongs to a different genus and inhabits the North Pacific.

Felsic<====>11795<====>FelsicIn geology, felsic refers to igneous rocks that are relatively rich in elements that form feldspar and quartz.  Marshak, Stephen, 2009, Essentials of Geology, W.  W.  Norton & Company, 3rd ed.It is contrasted with mafic rocks, which are relatively richer in magnesium and iron.  Felsic refers to those rocks rich in silicate minerals, magma, and rocks which are enriched in the lighter elements such as silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, and potassium. They are usually light in color and have specific gravities less than 3.  The most common felsic rock is granite. 

Frisians<====>11797<====>Frisians   The Frisians are a Germanic ethnic group indigenous to the coastal parts of the Netherlands and northwestern Germany.    They inhabit an area known as Frisia and are concentrated in the Dutch provinces of Friesland and Groningen and, in Germany, East Frisia and North Frisia (which was a part of Denmark until 1864).   The Frisian languages are still spoken by more than 500,000 people; West Frisian is officially recognized in the Netherlands (in Friesland), and North Frisian and Saterland Frisian are recognized as regional languages in Germany. HistoryThe ancient Frisii enter recorded history in the Roman account of Drusus's 12 BC war against the Rhine Germans and the Chauci.

He was associated with the utopian and Symbolist artistic and literary community Abbaye de Créteil between 1907 and 1908.  Marinetti is best known as the author of the first Futurist Manifesto, which was written and published in 1909; and also of the Fascist Manifesto. Childhood and adolescenceEmilio Angelo Carlo Marinetti (some documents give his name as "Filippo Achille Emilio Marinetti") spent the first years of his life in Alexandria, Egypt, where his father (Enrico Marinetti) and his mother (Amalia Grolli) lived together more uxorio (as if married). 

Franz Mesmer<====>11803<====>Franz Mesmer  Franz Friedrich Anton Mesmer ( ;   ; May 23, 1734 – March 5, 1815) was a German physician with an interest in astronomy, who theorised that there was a natural energetic transference that occurred between all animated and inanimate objects that he called animal magnetism, sometimes later referred to as mesmerism.  The theory attracted a wide following between about 1780 and 1850, and continued to have some influence until the end of the century.  Crabtree, introduction  In 1843 the Scottish physician James Braid proposed the term hypnosis for a technique derived from animal magnetism; today this is the usual meaning of   . 

Foix–Alajouanine syndrome<====>11806<====>Foix–Alajouanine syndrome Foix–Alajouanine syndrome is a disorder caused by an arteriovenous malformation of the spinal cord.    The patients present with symptoms indicating spinal cord involvement (paralysis of arms and legs, numbness and loss of sensation and sphincter dysfunction), and pathological examination reveals disseminated nerve cell death in the spinal cord and abnormally dilated and tortuous vessels situated on the surface of the spinal cord. Surgical treatment can be tried in some cases. If surgical intervention is contraindicated, corticosteroids may be used.The condition is named after Charles Foix and Théophile Alajouanine.See alsoVascular myelopathyReferences External linksDEFAULTSORT 

Ferromagnetism<====>11807<====>Ferromagnetism Ferromagnetism is the basic mechanism by which certain materials (such as iron) form permanent magnets, or are attracted to magnets.  In physics, several different types of magnetism are distinguished.  Ferromagnetism (including ferrimagnetism)    is the strongest type: it is the only one that typically creates forces strong enough to be felt, and is responsible for the common phenomena of magnetism in magnets encountered in everyday life.  Substances respond weakly to magnetic fields with three other types of magnetism, paramagnetism, diamagnetism, and antiferromagnetism, but the forces are usually so weak that they can only be detected by sensitive instruments in a laboratory.

Food additive<====>11815<====>Food additiveFood additives are substances added to food to preserve flavor or enhance its taste, appearance, or other qualities.  Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling (with vinegar), salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as with wines.  With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the twentieth century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin. NumberingTo regulate these additives, and inform consumers, each additive is assigned a unique number, termed as "E numbers", which is used in Europe for all approved additives. 

Fridtjof Nansen<====>11820<====>Fridtjof Nansen   Fridtjof Nansen (   ;  10 October 1861 – 13 May 1930) was a Norwegian explorer, scientist, diplomat, humanitarian, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate.  In his youth he was a champion skier and ice skater.  He led the team that made the first crossing of the Greenland interior in 1888, traversing the island on cross-country skis.  He won international fame after reaching a record northern latitude of 86°14′ during his North Pole expedition of 1893–96.  Although he retired from exploration after his return to Norway, his techniques of polar travel and his innovations in equipment and clothing influenced a generation of subsequent Arctic and Antarctic expeditions. 

Frederick Augustus II of Saxony<====>11824<====>Frederick Augustus II of Saxony  Frederick Augustus II (full name: Frederick Augustus Albert Maria Clemens Joseph Vincenz Aloys Nepomuk Johann Baptista Nikolaus Raphael Peter Xavier Franz de Paula Venantius Felix) (  18 May 1797 in Dresden – 9 August 1854 in Brennbüchel, Karrösten, Tyrol) was King of Saxony and a member of the House of Wettin.

Free market<====>11826<====>Free market  In economics, a free market is an idealized system in which the prices for goods and services are determined by the open market and consumers, in which the laws and forces of supply and demand are free from any intervention by a government, price-setting monopoly, or other authority.  Proponents of the concept of free market contrast it with a regulated market, in which a government intervenes in supply and demand through various methods such as tariffs used to restrict trade and protect the economy.  In an idealized free market economy, prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by government policy. 

Ford GT40<====>11830<====>Ford GT40The Ford GT40 is a high-performance endurance racing car based on the British Lola Mk6, with the Mk I, Mk II, and Mk III designed and built in England and the Mk IV built in the United States.

The GT40 won the 24 Hours of Le Mans four consecutive times, from 1966 to 1969 (1966 being the Mk II, 1967 the Mk IV, and 1968-1969 the oldest chassis design, the Mk I), including a 1-2-3 finish in 1966.  In 1966, with Henry Ford II personally in attendance at Le Mans, the Mk II GT40 provided Ford with the first overall Le Mans victory for an American manufacturer,   and the first victory for an American manufacturer at a major European race since Jimmy Murphy´s triumph with Duesenberg at the 1921 French Grand Prix. 

Glycine<====>11835<====>Glycine  Glycine (abbreviated as Gly or G) is the amino acid that has a single hydrogen atom as its side chain.  It is the simplest possible amino acid.  The chemical formula of glycine is NH 2 ‐CH 2 ‐COOH.  Glycine is one of the proteinogenic amino acids.  In the genetic code, all codons starting with GG, namely GGU, GGC, GGA, GGG, code for glycine. Glycine is a colorless, sweet-tasting crystalline solid.  It is the only achiral proteinogenic amino acid.  It can fit into hydrophilic or hydrophobic environments, due to its minimal side chain of only one hydrogen atom.

Gothenburg was founded as a heavily fortified, primarily Dutch, trading colony, by royal charter in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus.  In addition to the generous privileges (e. g.  tax relaxation) given to his Dutch allies from the then-ongoing Thirty Years' War, the king also attracted significant numbers of his German and Scottish allies to populate his only town on the western coast. 

Gotland County<====>11863<====>Gotland County Gotland County ( ) is a county or län of Sweden.  Gotland is located in the Baltic Sea to the east of Öland, and is the largest of Sweden's islands.  Counties are usually sub-divided into municipalities, but Gotland County only consists of one municipality: Gotland Municipality.  Gotland County is the only county in Sweden that is not governed by a county council.  The municipality handles the tasks that are otherwise handled by the county council, mainly health care and public transport.  Like other counties, Gotland has a County Administrative Board that oversees implementation of the Swedish state government. 

Global Positioning System<====>11866<====>Global Positioning System The Global Positioning System (GPS), originally Navstar GPS,   is a space-based radionavigation system owned by the United States government and operated by the United States Air Force.  It is a global navigation satellite system that provides geolocation and time information to a GPS receiver anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites.  The GPS does not require the user to transmit any data, and it operates independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the GPS positioning information.

GNU<====>11875<====>GNU  GNU is an operating system    and an extensive collection of computer software.  GNU is composed wholly of free software,    most of which is licensed under the GNU Project's own GPL. GNU is a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix!",   chosen because GNU's design is Unix-like, but differs from Unix by being free software and containing no Unix code. The GNU project includes an operating system kernel, GNU HURD, which was the original focus of the Free Software Foundation (FSF). 

Gradualism<====>11877<====>GradualismGradualism, from Latin gradus ("step"), is a hypothesis, a theory or a tenet assuming that change comes about gradually or that variation is gradual in nature.   Uniformitarianism, incrementalism, and reformism are similar concepts. Geology and biology In the natural sciences, gradualism is the theory which holds that profound change is the cumulative product of slow but continuous processes, often contrasted with catastrophism.   The theory was proposed in 1795 by James Hutton, a Scottish geologist, and was later incorporated into Charles Lyell's theory of uniformitarianism.   Tenets from both theories were applied to biology and formed the basis of early evolutionary theory. 

Germanic languages<====>11883<====>Germanic languages   The Germanic languages are a branch of the Indo-European language family spoken natively by a population of about 515 million people  mainly in Europe, North America, Oceania, and Southern Africa.

It has the longest documented history of any living Indo-European language, spanning 34 centuries of written records.   Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history; other systems, such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary, were used previously.   The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin, Cyrillic, Armenian, Coptic, Gothic and many other writing systems. 

Golem<====>11888<====>Golem In Jewish folklore, a golem (   ;  ) is an animated anthropomorphic being that is magically created entirely from inanimate matter (specifically clay or mud).  The word was used to mean an amorphous, unformed material in Psalms and medieval writing.    page 296 The most famous golem narrative involves Judah Loew ben Bezalel, the late-16th-century rabbi of Prague.  There are many tales differing on how the golem was brought to life and afterward controlled.   According to Moment Magazine, "the golem is a highly mutable metaphor with seemingly limitless symbolism.  It can be victim or villain, Jew or non-Jew, man or woman—or sometimes both.

For example, consider these two definitions:a triangle: A plane figure that has 3 straight bounding sides. a quadrilateral: A plane figure that has 4 straight bounding sides. Those definitions can be expressed as one genus and two differentiae:one genus:the genus for both a triangle and a quadrilateral: "A plane figure"two differentiae:the differentia for a triangle: "that has 3 straight bounding sides. 

Firearm<====>11966<====>Firearm A firearm is a portable gun (a barreled ranged weapon) that inflicts damage on targets by launching one or more projectiles driven by rapidly expanding high-pressure gas produced by exothermic combustion (deflagration) of propellant within an ammunition cartridge.

Galaxy formation and evolution<====>11971<====>Galaxy formation and evolution  The study of galaxy formation and evolution is concerned with the processes that formed a heterogeneous universe from a homogeneous beginning, the formation of the first galaxies, the way galaxies change over time, and the processes that have generated the variety of structures observed in nearby galaxies. Galaxy formation is hypothesized to occur, from structure formation theories, as a result of tiny quantum fluctuations in the aftermath of the Big Bang.  The simplest model for this that is in general agreement with observed phenomena is the Λ-Cold Dark Matter cosmology; that is to say that clustering and merging is how galaxies gain in mass, and can also determine their shape and structure.

Timeline of the history of Gibraltar<====>12078<====>Timeline of the history of Gibraltar  The history of Gibraltar portrays how The Rock gained an importance and a reputation far exceeding its size, influencing and shaping the people who came to reside here over the centuries.  Prehistoric Evidence of hominid inhabitation of the Rock dates back to the Neanderthals.  A Neanderthal skull was discovered in Forbes' Quarry in 1848, prior to the "original" discovery in the Neander Valley.  In 1926, the skull of a Neanderthal child was found in Devil's Tower. Mousterian deposits found at Gorham's Cave, which are associated with Neanderthals in Europe, have been dated to as recently as 28,000 to 24,000 BP,  leading to suggestions that Gibraltar was one of the last places of Neanderthal habitation.

Graviton<====>12100<====>Graviton   In speculative theories of quantum gravity, the graviton is a hypothetical elementary particle that mediates the force of gravitation in the framework of quantum field theory (QFT).  In QFT, the fundamental forces are mediated by the exchange of particles, and if such a particle exists for gravity, QFT would describe all of the known forces.  However, there is no complete theory of gravitons due to an outstanding mathematical problem with renormalization.  Lacking such a theory, the most complete theory of gravitation is general relativity, a non-QFT system.  This problem has been a major motivation for models beyond quantum field theory, such as string theory.

Greenland<====>12118<====>Greenland Greenland ( ,  ;  ,  ) is an autonomous constituent country within the Kingdom of Denmark between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.  Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium.  The Fate of Greenland's Vikings, by Dale Mackenzie Brown, Archaeological Institute of America, 28 February 2000  The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. 

Geography of Greenland<====>12120<====>Geography of Greenland Greenland is located between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean, northeast of Canada and northwest of Iceland.  The territory comprises the island of Greenland–the largest island in the world–and more than a hundred other smaller islands (see alphabetic list).  As an island, Greenland has no land boundaries and 44,087 km of coastline.  A sparse population is confined to small settlements along certain sectors of the coast.  Greenland possesses the world's second largest ice sheet. Greenland sits atop the Greenland plate, a subplate of the North American plate.    The Greenland craton is made up of some of the oldest rocks on the face of the earth.

Politics of Greenland<====>12122<====>Politics of Greenland  The politics of Greenland, a "constituent country" ( ) of the Kingdom of Denmark, function in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic dependency, whereby the prime minister is the head of government, and of a multi-party system.  Executive power is exercised by the government.  Legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament Inatsisartut.  The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.  Greenland has full autonomy on most matters, except on policies and decisions affecting the region including negotiations with the devolved legislatures and the Folketing ( ). 

Economy of Greenland<====>12123<====>Economy of Greenland The economy of Greenland can be characterized as small, mixed and vulnerable.   Greenland's economy consists of a big public sector and comprehensive  foreign trade.  This has resulted in an economy with periods of strong growth, considerable inflation, unemployment problems and extreme dependence on capital inflow from Denmark and on outside, mainly Danish, skilled labor.    GDP per capita is close to the average for European economies, but the economy is critically dependent upon substantial support from the Danish government, which supplies about half the revenues of the home rule government, which in turn employs 10,307 Greenlanders   out of 25,620 currently in employment (2015). 

Telecommunications in Greenland<====>12124<====>Telecommunications in GreenlandTelecommunications in Greenland include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet.

Transport in Greenland<====>12125<====>Transport in Greenland The transportation system in Greenland is very unusual in that Greenland has no railways, no inland waterways, and virtually no roads between towns.  Historically the major means of transportation has been by boat around the coast in summer and by dog sled in winter, particularly in the north and east. Air transport While Germany occupied Denmark during World War II, the United States controlled Greenland and built bases and airports.  The airports were codenamed as Bluie West One through to Bluie West Eight on the west of the island and Bluie East One to Bluie East Four on the eastern side (some had only sea plane access, some no air access). 

Military of Greenland<====>12126<====>Military of Greenland  The government of Greenland does not have control of Greenland's military or foreign affairs.  The defence of Greenland is the responsibility of Denmark.  However, following the November 2008 referendum on increased autonomy, which attracted significant popular support (72% turnout, 75% vote in favor), the governments of Greenland and Denmark have agreed to a 30-point package that will begin to give Greenland greater powers over defence and foreign affairs. Native militaryGreenland has no regular military, the Royal Danish Navy Maintains several bases, under the Joint Arctic Command, and conducts coast guard as well as search and rescue operations. 

Foreign relations of Greenland<====>12127<====>Foreign relations of Greenland Being part of the Kingdom of Denmark, the foreign relations of Greenland are handled in cooperation with the Danish government and Government of Greenland.

The apex of the Nazification of Germany was in the resolutions approved during the Nuremberg Rally of 1935, when the symbols of the Party and the State were fused (see Flag of Germany) and the German Jews were deprived of citizenship (see Nuremberg Laws), paving the way for the Holocaust. TerminologyThe Nazis used the word   for the process of successively establishing a system of totalitarian control and coordination over all aspects of society. 

Georg Cantor<====>12216<====>Georg Cantor  Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor (   ;  ;   – January 6, 1918 ) was a German mathematician.   He invented set theory, which has become a fundamental theory in mathematics.  Cantor established the importance of one-to-one correspondence between the members of two sets, defined infinite and well-ordered sets, and proved that the real numbers are more numerous than the natural numbers.  In fact, Cantor's method of proof of this theorem implies the existence of an "infinity of infinities".  He defined the cardinal and ordinal numbers and their arithmetic.  Cantor's work is of great philosophical interest, a fact of which he was well aware.

Great man theory<====>12223<====>Great man theoryThe great man theory is a 19th-century idea according to which history can be largely explained by the impact of great men, or heroes; highly influential individuals who, due to either their personal charisma, intelligence, wisdom, or political skill used their power in a way that had a decisive historical impact.  The theory was popularized in the 1840s by Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle, but in 1860 Herbert Spencer formulated a counter-argument that has remained influential throughout the 20th century to the present: Spencer said that such great men are the products of their societies, and that their actions would be impossible without the social conditions built before their lifetimes. 

Great Pyramid of Giza<====>12224<====>Great Pyramid of Giza    The Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the Pyramid of Cheops) is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex bordering what is now El Giza, Egypt.  It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact. Based on a mark in an interior chamber naming the work gang and a reference to fourth dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu, Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was built as a tomb over a 10 to 20-year period concluding around 2560 BC. 

GURPS<====>12228<====>GURPS  The Generic Universal RolePlaying System, or GURPS, is a tabletop role-playing game system designed to allow for play in any game setting.  It was created by Steve Jackson Games and first published in 1986 at a time when most such systems were story- or genre-specific. Players control their in-game characters verbally and the success of their actions are determined by the skill of their character, the difficulty of the action, and the rolling of dice.  Characters earn points during play which are used to gain greater abilities.  Gaming sessions are story-told and run by "Game Masters" (often referred to as simply "GMs"). 

Government<====>12229<====>Government   A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, often a state.   In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislature, administration, and judiciary.

Gold<====>12240<====>GoldGold is a chemical element with symbol Au (from  ) and atomic number 79.  In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal.  Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element.  It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions.  Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits.  It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. 

Gallium<====>12241<====>Gallium   Gallium is a chemical element with symbol Ga and atomic number 31.  It is in group 13 of the periodic table, and thus has similarities to the other metals of the group, aluminium, indium, and thallium.  Gallium does not occur as a free element in nature, but as gallium(III) compounds in trace amounts in zinc ores and in  bauxite.   Elemental gallium is a soft, silvery blue metal at standard temperature and pressure, a brittle solid at low temperatures, and a liquid at temperatures greater than   (above room temperature, but below the normal human body temperature). 

Germanium<====>12242<====>Germanium   Germanium is a chemical element with symbol Ge and atomic number 32.  It is a lustrous, hard, grayish-white metalloid in the carbon group, chemically similar to its group neighbors tin and silicon.  Pure germanium is a semiconductor with an appearance similar to elemental silicon.  Like silicon, germanium naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in nature. Because it seldom appears in high concentration, germanium was discovered comparatively late in the history of chemistry.  Germanium ranks near fiftieth in relative abundance of the elements in the Earth's crust.  In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev predicted its existence and some of its properties from its position on his periodic table, and called the element ekasilicon. 

Gadolinium<====>12243<====>Gadolinium Gadolinium is a chemical element with symbol Gd and atomic number 64.  Gadolinium is a silvery-white, malleable, and ductile rare earth metal.  It is found in nature only in oxidized form, and even when separated, it usually has impurities of the other rare earths.  Gadolinium was discovered in 1880 by Jean Charles de Marignac, who detected its oxide by using spectroscopy.  It is named after the mineral gadolinite, one of the minerals in which gadolinium is found, itself named for the chemist Johan Gadolin.  Pure gadolinium was first isolated by the chemist Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran around 1886. 

German Unity Day<====>12244<====>German Unity Day    The Day of German Unity ( ) is the national day of Germany, celebrated on 3 October as a public holiday.   It commemorates the anniversary of German reunification in 1990, when the goal of a united Germany that originated in the middle of the 19th century, was fulfilled again.  Therefore, the name addresses neither the re-union nor the union, but the unity of Germany.  The Day of German Unity on 3 October has been the German national holiday since 1990, when the reunification was formally completed. An alternative choice to commemorate the reunification could have been the day the Berlin Wall came down: 9 November 1989, which coincided with the anniversary of the proclamation of the German Republic in 1918, and the defeat of Hitler's first coup in 1923. 

Alliance 90/The Greens<====>12246<====>Alliance 90/The Greens   Alliance 90/The Greens, often simply Greens (  or  ), is a green political party in Germany, formed from the merger of the German Green Party (founded in West Germany in 1980) and Alliance 90 (founded during the Revolution of 1989–1990 in East Germany) in 1993.   The focus of the party is on ecological, economic, and social sustainability.  Its leaders are Simone Peter and Cem Özdemir.  In the 2017 federal elections, the party came sixth with 8. 9% of the votes and 67 out of 709 seats in the Bundestag. 

Gheorghe Zamfir<====>12248<====>Gheorghe Zamfir Gheorghe Zamfir ( ; born April 6, 1941) is a Romanian pan flute musician. Zamfir is known for playing an expanded version of the traditional Romanian-style pan flute (nai) of 20 pipes to 22, 25, 28 and 30 pipes to increase its range, and obtaining as many as eight overtones (additionally to the fundamental tone) from each pipe by changing the embouchure. He is known as "The Master of the Pan Flute".   CareerZamfir came to the public eye when he was approached by Swiss ethnomusicologist Marcel Cellier, who extensively researched Romanian folk music in the 1960s. 

Georg Henrik von Wright<====>12250<====>Georg Henrik von Wright Georg Henrik von Wright ( , 14 June 1916 – 16 June 2003) was a Finnish philosopher, who succeeded Ludwig Wittgenstein as professor at the University of Cambridge.  He published in English, Finnish, German, and Swedish, having belonged to the Swedish-speaking minority of Finland.  Von Wright was of both Finnish and 17th-century Scottish ancestry.  WorkVon Wright's writings come under two broad categories.  The first is analytic philosophy and philosophical logic in the Anglo-American vein.  His 1951 books, An Essay in Modal Logic and Deontic Logic, were landmarks in the postwar rise of formal modal logic and its deontic version.

The recorded originator of 'G' is freedman Spurius Carvilius Ruga, the first Roman to open a fee-paying school, who taught around 230 BC.  At this time, 'K' had fallen out of favor, and 'C', which had formerly represented both   and   before open vowels, had come to express   in all environments. 

Gamma<====>12257<====>Gamma    Gamma (uppercase  , lowercase   ;   gámma) is the third letter of the Greek alphabet.  In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 3.  In Ancient Greek, the letter gamma represented a voiced velar stop  .  In Modern Greek, this letter represents either a voiced velar fricative or a voiced palatal fricative. In the International Phonetic Alphabet and other modern Latin-alphabet based phonetic notations, it represents the voiced velar fricative. History The Greek letter Gamma Γ was derived from the Phoenician letter for the /g/ phoneme (  gīml), and as such is cognate with Hebrew gimel ג.

Genetics<====>12266<====>Genetics Genetics is the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity in living organisms.Hartl D, Jones E (2005)  It is generally considered a field of biology, but intersects frequently with many other life sciences and is strongly linked with the study of information systems. The father of genetics is Gregor Mendel, a late 19th-century scientist and Augustinian friar.  Mendel studied "trait inheritance", patterns in the way traits are handed down from parents to offspring.  He observed that organisms (pea plants) inherit traits by way of discrete "units of inheritance".

Guy de Maupassant<====>12274<====>Guy de Maupassant    Henri René Albert Guy de Maupassant ( ;   ; 5 August 1850 – 6 July 1893) was a French writer, remembered as a master of the short story form, and as a representative of the naturalist school of writers, who depicted human lives and destinies and social forces in disillusioned and often pessimistic terms. Maupassant was a protégé of Flaubert and his stories are characterized by economy of style and efficient, effortless dénouements (outcomes).  Many are set during the Franco-Prussian War of the 1870s, describing the futility of war and the innocent civilians who, caught up in events beyond their control, are permanently changed by their experiences.

Ganglion<====>12278<====>Ganglion   A ganglion  is a nerve cell cluster  or a group of nerve cell bodies located in the autonomic nervous system and sensory system.    Ganglia house the cells bodies of afferent nerves and efferent nerves. A pseudoganglion looks like a ganglion but only has nerve fibers and has no nerve cell bodies. StructureGanglia are primarily made up of somata and dendritic structures which are bundled or connected.  Ganglia often interconnect with other ganglia to form a complex system of ganglia known as a plexus.  Ganglia provide relay points and intermediary connections between different neurological structures in the body, such as the peripheral and central nervous systems. 

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz<====>12281<====>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz    Gottfried Wilhelm (von) Leibniz ( ;or  ;   ;    – 14 November 1716) was a German polymath and philosopher who occupies a prominent place in the history of mathematics and the history of philosophy, having developed differential and integral calculus independently of Isaac Newton.   Leibniz's notation has been widely used ever since it was published.  It was only in the 20th century that his Law of Continuity and Transcendental Law of Homogeneity found mathematical implementation (by means of non-standard analysis).  He became one of the most prolific inventors in the field of mechanical calculators. 

Gamma World<====>12283<====>Gamma World  Gamma World is a science fantasy role-playing game, originally designed by James M.  Ward and Gary Jaquet, and first published by TSR in 1978.   It borrowed heavily from Ward's earlier product, Metamorphosis Alpha.  SettingGamma World takes place in the mid-25th century, more than a century after a second nuclear war had destroyed human civilization.  The war that destroyed civilization in Gamma World is only vaguely described in most editions of the game, and what details are provided change from version to version:The first two editions place a first nuclear war near the end of the 21st century, with the final war in the years AD 2309-2322, and ascribe the final annihilation to a terrorist group called "The Apocalypse"  and the ensuing retaliation by surviving factions. 

Grimoire<====>12284<====>Grimoire   A grimoire (   ) is a textbook of magic, typically including instructions on how to create magical objects like talismans and amulets, how to perform magical spells, charms and divination, and how to summon or invoke supernatural entities such as angels, spirits, and demons.  Davies (2009:1)  In many cases, the books themselves are believed to be imbued with magical powers, though in many cultures, other sacred texts that are not grimoires (such as the Bible) have been believed to have supernatural properties intrinsically.  In this manner, while all books on magic could be thought of as grimoires, not all magical books should be thought of as grimoires. 

Grand Guignol<====>12285<====>Grand Guignol Le Théâtre du Grand-Guignol ( : "The Theatre of the Great Puppet")—known as the Grand Guignol—was a theatre in the Pigalle area of Paris (at 20 bis,  ).  From its opening in 1897 until its closing in 1962, it specialised in naturalistic horror shows.  Its name is often used as a general term for graphic, amoral horror entertainment, a genre popular from Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre (for instance Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, and Webster's The Duchess of Malfi and The White Devil), to today's splatter films. TheatreLe Théâtre du Grand-Guignol was founded in 1894 by Oscar Méténier, who planned it as a space for naturalist performance. 

Great Plague of London<====>12286<====>Great Plague of London The Great Plague, lasting from 1665 to 1666, was the last major epidemic of the bubonic plague to occur in England.  It happened within the centuries-long time period of the Second Pandemic, an extended period of intermittent bubonic plague epidemics which began in Europe in 1347, the first year of the Black Death, an outbreak which included other forms such as pneumonic plague, and lasted until 1750.  The Great Plague killed an estimated 100,000 people—almost a quarter of London's population—in 18 months. The plague was caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium,  which is usually transmitted through the bite of an infected rat flea. 

Graphical user interface<====>12293<====>Graphical user interface The graphical user interface (GUI  ), is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.  GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces (CLIs), Computerhope. com  Technet. com  Technet. com  which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard. The actions in a GUI are usually performed through direct manipulation of the graphical elements.   Beyond computers, GUIs are used in many handheld mobile devices such as MP3 players, portable media players, gaming devices, smartphones and smaller household, office and industrial controls. 

Gamete<====>12295<====>Gamete  A gamete (from Ancient Greek γαμετή gamete from gamein "to marry"   ) is a haploid cell that fuses  with another haploid cell during fertilization (conception) in organisms that sexually reproduce.  In species that produce two morphologically distinct types of gametes, and in which each individual produces only one type, a female is any individual that produces the larger type of gamete—called an ovum (or egg)—and a male produces the smaller tadpole-like type—called a sperm.  This is an example of anisogamy or heterogamy, the condition in which females and males produce gametes of different sizes (this is the case in humans; the human ovum has approximately 100,000 times the volume of a single human sperm cell  ).

He began the first volume of the series, A Game of Thrones, in 1991 and had it published in 1996.  Martin, who initially envisioned the series as a trilogy, has published five out of a planned seven volumes.  The fifth and most recent volume of the series published in 2011, A Dance with Dragons, took Martin  six years to write.  He is still writing the sixth novel, The Winds of Winter. 

World of A Song of Ice and Fire<====>12302<====>World of A Song of Ice and Fire   DISPLAYTITLE The fictional world in which the A Song of Ice and Fire novels by George R.  R.  Martin take place is divided into several continents, known collectively as The Known World. Most of the story takes place on the continent Westeros, in a large political entity known as the Seven Kingdoms.  The "Seven Kingdoms" actually consist of nine regions (the North, the Iron Islands, the Riverlands, the Vale, the Westerlands, the Stormlands, the Reach, the Crownlands, and Dorne),    and there is a largely unmapped area to the north, separated from the Seven Kingdoms by a massive wall of ice and old magic. 

Grandmaster (chess)<====>12304<====>Grandmaster (chess)The title Grandmaster (GM) is awarded to chess players by the world chess organization FIDE.  Apart from World Champion, Grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain. Once achieved, the title is held for life.  The abbreviation IGM for International Grandmaster is also sometimes used, particularly in older literature. The title of Grandmaster, along with the lesser FIDE titles of International Master (IM) and FIDE Master (FM), is open to both men and women.  The vast majority of grandmasters are men,  but a number of women have also earned the GM title, with the first three having been Nona Gaprindashvili in 1978, Maia Chiburdanidze in 1984  and Susan Polgar in 1991. 

Gotthold Ephraim Lessing<====>12305<====>Gotthold Ephraim Lessing  Gotthold Ephraim Lessing ( ; 22 January 1729 – 15 February 1781) was a German writer, philosopher, dramatist, publicist and art critic, and one of the most outstanding representatives of the Enlightenment era.

Geotechnical engineering<====>12306<====>Geotechnical engineering Geotechnical engineering is the branch of civil engineering concerned with the engineering behavior of earth materials.  Geotechnical engineering is important in civil engineering, but also has applications in military, mining, petroleum and other engineering disciplines that are concerned with construction occurring on the surface or within the ground.  Geotechnical engineering uses principles of soil mechanics and rock mechanics to investigate subsurface conditions and materials; determine the relevant physical/mechanical and chemical properties of these materials; evaluate stability of natural slopes and man-made soil deposits; assess risks posed by site conditions; design earthworks and structure foundations; and monitor site conditions, earthwork and foundation construction. 

Gustave Flaubert<====>12307<====>Gustave Flaubert Gustave Flaubert ( ; 12 December 1821 – 8 May 1880) was a French novelist.  Highly influential, he has been considered the leading exponent of literary realism in his country.  He is known especially for his debut novel Madame Bovary (1857), his Correspondence, and his scrupulous devotion to his style and aesthetics.  The celebrated short story writer Guy de Maupassant was a   of Flaubert. LifeEarly life and educationFlaubert was born on 12 December 1821, in Rouen, in the Seine-Maritime department of Upper Normandy, in northern France.

Gregory Chaitin<====>12308<====>Gregory Chaitin Gregory John Chaitin (   ; born 15 November 1947)   is an Argentine-American mathematician and computer scientist.  Beginning in the late 1960s, Chaitin made contributions to algorithmic information theory and metamathematics, in particular a computer-theoretic result equivalent to Gödel's incompleteness theorem.  He is considered to be one of the founders of what is today known as Kolmogorov (or Kolmogorov-Chaitin) complexity together with Andrei Kolmogorov and Ray Solomonoff.  Today, algorithmic information theory is a common subject in any computer science curriculum.   Mathematics and computer scienceHe attended the Bronx High School of Science and City College of New York, where he (still in his teens) developed the theory that led to his independent discovery of Kolmogorov complexity.

Gestation<====>12312<====>GestationGestation is the carrying of an embryo or fetus inside female viviparous animals.  It is typical for mammals, but also occurs for some non-mammals.   Mammals during pregnancy can have one or more gestations at the same time (multiple gestations). The time interval of a gestation is called the gestation period.  In  human obstetrics, gestational age refers to the embryonic or fetal age plus two weeks.  This is approximately the duration since the woman's last menstrual period (LMP) began. Mammals In mammals, pregnancy begins when a zygote (fertilized ovum) implants in the female's uterus and ends once the fetus leaves the uterus. 

Gamma function<====>12316<====>Gamma function  In mathematics, the gamma function (represented by the capital Greek alphabet letter  ) is an extension of the factorial function, with its argument shifted down by 1, to real and complex numbers.  If   is a positive integer, \Gamma(n) = (n-1)! The gamma function is defined for all complex numbers except the non-positive integers.  For complex numbers with a positive real part, it is defined via a convergent improper integral:  \Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty x^{z-1} e^{-x}\,dx This integral function is extended by analytic continuation to all complex numbers except the non-positive integers (where the function has simple poles), yielding the meromorphic function we call the gamma function. 

Georges Braque<====>12317<====>Georges Braque Georges Braque ( ;  ; 13 May 1882 – 31 August 1963) was a major 20th-century French painter, collagist, draughtsman, printmaker and sculptor.  His most important contributions to the history of art were in his alliance with Fauvism from 1906, and the role he played in the development of Cubism.  Braque’s work between 1908 and 1912 is closely associated with that of his colleague Pablo Picasso.  Their respective Cubist works were indistinguishable for many years, yet the quiet nature of Braque was partially eclipsed by the fame and notoriety of Picasso.  Lewis Kachur, From Grove Art Online, MoMA, 2009 Oxford University Press Early lifeGeorges Braque was born on 13 May 1882 in Argenteuil, Val-d'Oise.

The author of the tune is unknown and it may originate in plainchant, but a 1619 attribution to John Bull is sometimes made. It is the national anthem of the United Kingdom and one of two national anthems used by New Zealand since 1977, as well as for several of the UK's territories that have their own additional local anthem. 

Gladiator<====>12336<====>Gladiator    A gladiator ( , "swordsman", from  , "sword") was an armed combatant who entertained audiences in the Roman Republic and Roman Empire in violent confrontations with other gladiators, wild animals, and condemned criminals.  Some gladiators were volunteers who risked their lives and their legal and social standing by appearing in the arena.  Most were despised as slaves, schooled under harsh conditions, socially marginalized, and segregated even in death. Irrespective of their origin, gladiators offered spectators an example of Rome's martial ethics and, in fighting or dying well, they could inspire admiration and popular acclaim. 

Genetically modified organism<====>12339<====>Genetically modified organism    A genetically modified organism (GMO) is any organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques (i. e. , a genetically engineered organism).  GMOs are used to produce many medications and genetically modified foods and are widely used in scientific research and the production of other goods.  The term GMO is very close to the technical legal term, 'living modified organism', defined in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, which regulates international trade in living GMOs (specifically, "any living organism that possesses a novel combination of genetic material obtained through the use of modern biotechnology").

Glagolitic script<====>12353<====>Glagolitic script   The Glagolitic script ( ,  Ⰳⰾⰰⰳⱁⰾⰹⱌⰰ Glagolitsa) is the oldest known Slavic alphabet.  It is generally agreed to have been created in the 9th century by Saint Cyril, a Byzantine monk from Thessaloniki.  He and his brother, Saint Methodius, were sent by the Byzantine Emperor Michael III in 863 to Great Moravia to spread Christianity among the West Slavs in the area.  The brothers decided to translate liturgical books into the Old Slavic language that was understandable to the general population, but as the words of that language could not be easily written by using either the Greek or Latin alphabets, Cyril decided to invent a new script, Glagolitic, which he based on the local dialect of the Slavic tribes from the Byzantine Salonika region. 

Greatest common divisor<====>12354<====>Greatest common divisorIn mathematics, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers.   For example, the gcd of 8 and 12 is 4.  The greatest common divisor is also known as the greatest common factor (gcf),  highest common factor (hcf),  greatest common measure (gcm),  or highest common divisor.  This notion can be extended to polynomials (see Polynomial greatest common divisor) and other commutative rings (see below). OverviewNotationIn this article we will denote the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b as gcd(a,b). 

Gazpacho<====>12357<====>Gazpacho   Gazpacho ( ;  ) or Andalusian Gazpacho is a soup made of raw blended vegetables and served cold,  originating in the southern Spanish region of Andalusia.  Gazpacho is widely eaten in Spain and Portugal ( , gaspacho), particularly during the hot summers, as it is refreshing and cool. There are other recipes called gazpacho, such as gazpacho manchego, which is very different from Andalusian Gazpacho.  There are also a number of dishes that are closely related to Andalusian Gazpacho, such as ajoblanco, salmorejo, pipirrana, porra antequerana, cojondongo and Portuguese gaspacho. HistoryGazpacho has ancient roots. 

Gnome<====>12361<====>Gnome A gnome    is a diminutive spirit in Renaissance magic and alchemy, first introduced by Paracelsus in the 16th century and later adopted by more recent authors including those of modern fantasy literature.  Its characteristics have been reinterpreted to suit the needs of various story tellers, but it is typically said to be a small humanoid that lives underground.    HistoryOriginsThe word comes from Renaissance Latin gnomus, which first appears in the Liber de Nymphis, Sylvanis, Pygmaeis, Salamandris, et Gigantibus etc.  by Paracelsus, published posthumously in Nysa in 1566 (and again in the Johannes Huser edition of 1589–1591 from an autograph by Paracelsus). 

Googolplex<====>12365<====>Googolplex  A googolplex is the number 10 , or equivalently, 10 .  Written out in ordinary decimal notation, it is 1 followed by 10 100  zeroes, that is, a 1 followed by a googol of zeroes. HistoryIn 1920, Edward Kasner's nine-year-old nephew, Milton Sirotta, coined the term googol, which is 10 , then proposed the further term googolplex to be "one, followed by writing zeroes until you get tired".   Kasner decided to adopt a more formal definition "but different people get tired at different times and it would never do to have Carnera a better mathematician than Dr. 

Graphite<====>12366<====>Graphite  Graphite ( ), archaically referred to as plumbago, is a crystalline allotrope of carbon, a semimetal, a native element mineral, and a form of coal.Graphite is the most stable form of carbon under standard conditions.  Therefore, it is used in thermochemistry as the standard state for defining the heat of formation of carbon compounds.   Types and varietiesThe principal types of natural graphite, each occurring in different types of ore deposits are:Crystalline small flakes of graphite (or flake graphite) occurs as isolated, flat, plate-like particles with hexagonal edges if unbroken.  When broken the edges can be irregular or angular;Amorphous graphite: very fine flake graphite is sometimes called amorphous; Lump graphite (or vein graphite) occurs in fissure veins or fractures and appears as massive platy intergrowths of fibrous or acicular crystalline aggregates, and is probably hydrothermal in origin. 

Garry Trudeau<====>12367<====>Garry Trudeau  Garretson Beekman "Garry" Trudeau (born July 21, 1948) is an American cartoonist, best known for the Doonesbury comic strip.  Trudeau is also the creator and executive producer of the Amazon Studios political comedy series Alpha House. Background and education Trudeau was born in New York City, the son of Jean Douglas (née Moore) and Francis Berger Trudeau, Jr.  He is the great-grandson of Dr.  Edward Livingston Trudeau, who created Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium for the treatment of  pulmonary tuberculosis at Saranac Lake, New York.  Edward was succeeded by his son Francis and grandson Francis Jr. 

Guild<====>12369<====>Guild A guild    is an association of artisans or merchants who oversee the practice of their craft in a particular town.  The earliest types of guild were formed as confraternities of tradesmen.  They were organized in a manner something between a professional association, trade union, a cartel, and a secret society.   They often depended on grants of letters patent by a monarch or other authority to enforce the flow of trade to their self-employed members, and to retain ownership of tools and the supply of materials.  A lasting legacy of traditional guilds are the   constructed and used as meeting places. 

Gradius (video game)<====>12372<====>Gradius (video game)    is a 1985 horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up video game developed and published by Konami, originally released as a coin-operated arcade game in  .  It was the first game in the Gradius series of shoot 'em ups.  In Gradius, the player maneuvers a spacecraft known as the Vic Viper that must defend itself from the various alien enemies.  The game features a power-up system called the "power meter", based upon collecting capsules to 'purchase' additional weapons. The arcade version of Gradius was released internationally outside Japan under the title of Nemesis, although later releases kept the original title. 

Gamemaster<====>12373<====>Gamemaster   A gamemaster (GM; also known as game master, game manager, game moderator or referee) is a person who acts as an organizer, officiant for questions regarding rules, arbitrator, and moderator for a multiplayer role-playing game.    They are more common in co-operative games in which players work together than in competitive games in which players oppose each other.  The act performed by a gamemaster is sometimes referred to as "Gamemastering" or simply "GM-ing". The role of a gamemaster in a traditional table-top role-playing game (pencil-and-paper role-playing game) is to weave the other participants' player-character stories together, control the non-player aspects of the game, create environments in which the players can interact, and solve any player disputes. 

Genetic engineering<====>12383<====>Genetic engineering Genetic engineering, also called genetic modification, is the direct manipulation of an organism's genes using biotechnology.  It is a set of technologies used to change the genetic makeup of cells, including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce improved or novel organisms.  New DNA is obtained by either isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using recombinant DNA methods or by artificially synthesising the DNA.  A construct is usually created and used to insert this DNA into the host organism.  The first recombinant DNA molecule was made by Paul Berg in 1972 by combining DNA from the monkey virus SV40 with the lambda virus. 

Gettysburg Address<====>12384<====>Gettysburg Address   The Gettysburg Address is a speech by U. S.  President Abraham Lincoln, and one of the best-known speeches in American history.    It was delivered by Lincoln during the American Civil War at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania on the afternoon of Thursday, November 19, 1863 four and a half months after the Union armies defeated those of the Confederacy at the Battle of Gettysburg. Lincoln's carefully crafted address, secondary to others' presentations that day, came to be seen as one of the greatest and most influential statements of American national purpose. 

Genetic code<====>12385<====>Genetic code The genetic code is the set of rules by which information encoded within genetic material (DNA or mRNA sequences) is translated into proteins by living cells.  Translation is accomplished by the ribosome, which links amino acids in an order specified by messenger RNA (mRNA), using transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA three nucleotides at a time.  The genetic code is highly similar among all organisms and can be expressed in a simple table with 64 entries.  The code defines how sequences of nucleotide triplets, called codons, specify which amino acid will be added next during protein synthesis. 

Golden ratio<====>12386<====>Golden ratio  In mathematics, two quantities are in the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities.  The figure on the right illustrates the geometric relationship.  Expressed algebraically, for quantities a and b with a > b > 0,  \frac{a+b}{a} = \frac{a}{b} \ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \varphi, where the Greek letter phi ( \varphi  or  \phi ) represents the golden ratio.   It is an irrational number with a value of: \varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} = 1. 6180339887\ldots. The golden ratio is also called the golden mean or golden section (Latin: sectio aurea). 

Genome<====>12388<====>Genome    In terms of modern molecular biology and genetics, a genome is the genetic material  of an organism.  It consists of DNA (or RNA in RNA viruses).  The genome includes both the genes (the coding regions) and the noncoding DNA,  as well as the genetic material of the mitochondria  and chloroplasts. Non-technical overviewA genome is all the genetic information of an organism.  For example, the human genome is analogous to the instructions stored in a cookbook.  Just as a cookbook gives the instructions needed to make a range of meals including a holiday feast or a summer picnic, the human genome contains all the instructions needed to make the full range of human cell types including muscle cells or neurons. 

Gaia philosophy<====>12393<====>Gaia philosophy  Gaia philosophy (named after Gaia, Greek goddess of the Earth) is a broadly inclusive term for related concepts that living organisms on a planet will affect the nature of their environment in order to make the environment more suitable for life.  This set of theories holds that all organisms on a life-giving planet regulate the biosphere in such a way as to promote its habitability.  Gaia concept draws a connection between the survivability of a species (hence its evolutionary course) and its usefulness to the survival of other species. While there were a number of precursors to Gaia theory, the first scientific form of this idea was proposed as the Gaia hypothesis by James Lovelock, a UK chemist, in 1970. 

Greenhouse effect<====>12395<====>Greenhouse effect    The greenhouse effect is the process by which radiation from a planet's atmosphere warms the planet's surface to a temperature above what it would be without its atmosphere.   If a planet's atmosphere contains radiatively active gases (i. e. , greenhouse gases) they will radiate energy in all directions.  Part of this radiation is directed towards the surface, warming it.    The intensity of the downward radiation – that is, the strength of the greenhouse effect – will depend on the atmosphere's temperature and on the amount of greenhouse gases that the atmosphere contains. 

Group homomorphism<====>12396<====>Group homomorphism In mathematics, given two groups, (G, ∗) and (H, ·), a group homomorphism from (G, ∗) to (H, ·) is a function h : G → H such that for all u and v in G it holds that  h(u*v) = h(u) \cdot h(v)  where the group operation on the left hand side of the equation is that of G and on the right hand side that of H. From this property, one can deduce that h maps the identity element e G  of G to the identity element e H  of H, and it also maps inverses to inverses in the sense that   h\left(u^{-1}\right) = h(u)^{-1}. 

Group isomorphism<====>12397<====>Group isomorphism In abstract algebra, a group isomorphism is a function between two groups that sets up a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the groups in a way that respects the given group operations.  If there exists an isomorphism between two groups, then the groups are called isomorphic.  From the standpoint of group theory, isomorphic groups have the same properties and need not be distinguished. Definition and notationGiven two groups ( G , ∗) and ( H ,  \odot ), a group isomorphism from ( G , ∗) to ( H ,  \odot ) is a bijective group homomorphism from  G  to  H . 

Geographic information system<====>12398<====>Geographic information system A geographic information system (GIS) is a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present spatial or geographic data.  The acronym GIS is sometimes used for geographic information science (GIScience) to refer to the academic discipline that studies geographic information systems   and is a large domain within the broader academic discipline of geoinformatics.   What goes beyond a GIS is a spatial data infrastructure, a concept that has no such restrictive boundaries. In general, the term describes any information system that integrates, stores, edits, analyzes, shares, and displays geographic information.  GIS applications are tools that allow users to create interactive queries (user-created searches), analyze spatial information, edit data in maps, and present the results of all these operations. 

Graph theory<====>12401<====>Graph theory In mathematics,  graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects.  A graph in this context is made up of vertices, nodes, or points which are connected by edges, arcs, or lines.  A graph may be undirected, meaning that there is no distinction between the two vertices associated with each edge, or its edges may be directed from one vertex to another; see Graph (discrete mathematics) for more detailed definitions and for other variations in the types of graph that are commonly considered.  Graphs are one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics. 

Gumby<====>12405<====>Gumby  Gumby is an American clay animation franchise, centered on a green clay humanoid character created and modeled by Art Clokey.  The character has been the subject of two television series, a feature-length film and other media.  Since the original series aired, Gumby has become a famous example of stop-motion clay animation and an influential cultural icon, spawning tributes, parodies and merchandising. Overview Gumby follows the titular character on his adventures through different environments and times in history.  Gumby's primary sidekick is Pokey, a talking orange pony.  His nemeses are the Blockheads, a pair of red humanoid figures with cube-shaped heads, inspired by the trouble-making Katzenjammer Kids. 

Gioachino Rossini<====>12406<====>Gioachino Rossini  Gioachino Antonio Rossini   ( ; 29 February 1792 13 November 1868) was an Italian composer who wrote 39 operas, as well as some sacred music, songs, chamber music and piano pieces. A precocious composer of operas, he made his full debut at the age of eighteen with La cambiale di matrimonio.  His best-known operas include the Italian comedies Il barbiere di Siviglia (The Barber of Seville), L'italiana in Algeri (The Italian Girl in Algiers) and La Cenerentola (Cinderella).  He also wrote a string of serious operas in Italian, including works such as Tancredi, Otello and Semiramide. 

Gibberish<====>12407<====>Gibberish  Gibberish, alternatively jibberish, jibber-jabber, or gobbledygook, is language that is (or appears to be) nonsense.  It may include speech sounds that are not actual words,  or language games and specialized jargon that seems nonsensical to outsiders.   Gibberish should not be confused with literary nonsense such as that used in the poem "Jabberwocky" by Lewis Carroll.  The word gibberish is more commonly applied to informal speech, while gobbledygook (sometimes gobbledegook, gobbledigook or gobbledegoo) is more often applied to writing or language that is meaningless or is made unintelligible by excessive use of abstruse technical terms. 

Gnaeus Julius Agricola<====>12408<====>Gnaeus Julius Agricola Gnaeus Julius Agricola ( ; 13 June 40 – 23 August 93)  was a Gallo-Roman general responsible for much of the Roman conquest of Britain.  Written by his son-in-law Tacitus, the De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae is the primary source for most of what is known about him,  along with detailed archaeological evidence from northern Britain.  Agricola began his military career in Britain, serving under governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus.  His subsequent career saw him serve in a variety of positions; he was appointed quaestor in Asia province in 64, then Plebeian Tribune in 66, and praetor in 68. 

Guanosine<====>12417<====>Guanosine   Guanosine is a purine nucleoside comprising guanine attached to a ribose (ribofuranose) ring via a β-N 9 -glycosidic bond.  Guanosine can be phosphorylated to become guanosine monophosphate (GMP), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), guanosine diphosphate (GDP), and guanosine triphosphate (GTP).  These forms play important roles in various biochemical processes such as synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins, photosynthesis, muscle contraction, and intracellular signal transduction (cGMP).  When guanine is attached by its N9 nitrogen to the C1 carbon of a deoxyribose ring it is known as deoxyguanosine. The antiviral drug aciclovir, often used in herpes treatment, and the anti-HIV drug abacavir, are structurally similar to guanosine. 

Gödel's ontological proof<====>12420<====>Gödel's ontological proof Gödel's ontological proof is a formal argument by the mathematician Kurt Gödel (1906–1978) for God's existence.  More precisely, it presupposes the notion of positive and negative properties, and proves the necessary existence of an object which each positive property, but no negative property, applies to. The argument is in a line of development that goes back to Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109).   St.  Anselm's ontological argument, in its most succinct form, is as follows: "God, by definition, is that for which no greater can be conceived.  God exists in the understanding.  If God exists in the understanding, we could imagine Him to be greater by existing in reality.

Genetic programming<====>12424<====>Genetic programming In artificial intelligence, genetic programming (GP) is a technique whereby computer programs are encoded as a set of genes that are then modified (evolved) using an evolutionary algorithm (often a genetic algorithm, "GA") – it is an application of (for example) genetic algorithms where the space of solutions consists of computer programs.  The results are computer programs able to perform well in a predefined task.  The methods used to encode a computer program in an artificial chromosome and to evaluate its fitness with respect to the predefined task are central in the GP technique and still the subject of active research. 

Gustav Klimt<====>12425<====>Gustav Klimt Gustav Klimt (July 14, 1862 – February 6, 1918) was an Austrian symbolist painter and one of the most prominent members of the Vienna Secession movement.  Klimt is noted for his paintings, murals, sketches, and other objets d'art.  Klimt's primary subject was the female body,  and his works are marked by a frank eroticism.   In addition to his figurative works, which include allegories and portraits, he painted landscapes.  Among the artists of the Vienna Secession, Klimt was the most influenced by Japanese art and its methods. Early in his artistic career, he was a successful painter of architectural decorations in a conventional manner. 

Groucho Marx<====>12426<====>Groucho Marx  Julius Henry Marx (October 2, 1890 – August 19, 1977), known professionally as Groucho Marx ( ), was an American comedian, writer, stage, film, radio, and television star.   He was known as a master of quick wit and is widely considered one of the best comedians of the modern era.  He made 13 feature films with his siblings the Marx Brothers, of whom he was the third-born.  He also had a successful solo career, most notably as the host of the radio and television game show You Bet Your Life.  His distinctive appearance, carried over from his days in vaudeville, included quirks such as an exaggerated stooped posture, glasses, cigar, and a thick   mustache and eyebrows. 

Game Boy Advance<====>12430<====>Game Boy Advance   The Game Boy Advance  (GBA) is a 32-bit handheld video game console developed, manufactured and marketed by Nintendo as the successor to the Game Boy Color.  It was released in Japan on March 21, 2001, in North America on June 11, 2001, in Australia and Europe on June 22, 2001, and in mainland China on June 8, 2004 (as iQue Game Boy Advance).  Nintendo's competitors in the handheld market at the time were the Neo Geo Pocket Color, WonderSwan, GP32, Tapwave Zodiac, and the N-Gage.  Despite the competitors' best efforts, Nintendo maintained a majority market share with the Game Boy Advance. 

Google Search<====>12431<====>Google Search Google Search, commonly referred to as Google Web Search or simply Google, is a web search engine developed by Google.  It is the most-used search engine on the World Wide Web,  handling more than three billion searches each day., it is the most used search engine in the US with 64. 0% market share.  The order of search results returned by Google is based, in part, on a priority rank system called "PageRank".  Google Search also provides many different options for customized search, using symbols to include, exclude, specify or require certain search behavior, and offers specialized interactive experiences, such as flight status and package tracking, weather forecasts, currency, unit and time conversions, word definitions, and more. 

Genius<====>12432<====>Genius A genius is a person who displays exceptional intellectual ability, creative productivity, universality in genres or originality, typically to a degree that is associated with the achievement of new advances in a domain of knowledge.  Despite the presence of scholars in many subjects throughout history, many geniuses have shown high achievements in only a single kind of activity.    There is no scientifically precise definition of genius,  and the question of whether the notion itself has any real meaning has long been a subject of debate,  although psychologists are converging on a definition that emphasizes creativity and eminent achievement. 

Grape<====>12436<====>Grape  A grape is a fruit, botanically a  berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus Vitis. Grapes can be eaten fresh as table grapes or they can be used for making wine, jam, juice, jelly, grape seed extract, raisins, vinegar, and grape seed oil.  Grapes are a non-climacteric type of fruit, generally occurring in clusters.   HistoryThe cultivation of the domesticated grape began 6,000–8,000 years ago in the Near East.Yeast, one of the earliest domesticated microorganisms, occurs naturally on the skins of grapes, leading to the discovery of alcoholic drinks such as wine. 

Genetic disorder<====>12437<====>Genetic disorder   A genetic disorder is a genetic problem caused by one or more abnormalities in the genome, especially a condition that is present from birth (congenital).   Most genetic disorders are quite rare and affect one person in every several thousands or millions. Genetic disorders may be hereditary, passed down from the parents' genes.  In other genetic disorders, defects may be caused by new mutations or changes to the DNA.  In such cases, the defect will only be passed down if it occurs in the germ line.  The same disease, such as some forms of cancer, may be caused by an inherited genetic condition in some people, by new mutations in other people, and mainly by environmental causes in other people. 

Guanine<====>12439<====>Guanine  Guanine ( ; or G, Gua) is one of the four main nucleobases found in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA, the others being adenine, cytosine, and thymine (uracil in RNA).  In DNA, guanine is paired with cytosine.  The guanine nucleoside is called guanosine. With the formula C 5 H 5 N 5 O, guanine is a derivative of purine, consisting of a fused pyrimidine-imidazole ring system with conjugated double bonds.  Being unsaturated, the bicyclic molecule is planar. PropertiesGuanine, along with adenine and cytosine, is present in both DNA and RNA, whereas thymine is usually seen only in DNA, and uracil only in RNA. 

Genocide<====>12441<====>Genocide    Genocide is intentional action to destroy a people (usually defined as an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group) in whole or in part.  The hybrid word "genocide" is a combination of the Greek word génos ("race, people") and the Latin suffix -cide ("act of killing").   The United Nations Genocide Convention, which was established in 1948, defines genocide as "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group".The term genocide was coined by Raphael Lemkin in his 1944  book Axis Rule in Occupied Europe;   it has been applied to the Holocaust, the Armenian genocide and many other mass killings including the genocide of indigenous peoples in the Americas, the Greek genocide, the Indonesian killings of 1965–66, the Assyrian genocide, the Serbian genocide, the Holodomor, the 1971 Bangladesh genocide, the Cambodian genocide, the Guatemalan genocide, and, more recently, the Bosnian genocide, the Kurdish genocide, and the Rwandan genocide.

Germanic peoples<====>12446<====>Germanic peoples   The Germanic peoples (also called Teutonic, Suebian, or Gothic in older literature) are an Indo-European ethno-linguistic group of Northern European origin.   They are identified by their use of Germanic languages, which diversified out of Proto-Germanic during the Pre-Roman Iron Age.  Encyclopædia Britannica, "Germanic Peoples" The term "Germanic" originated in classical times when groups of tribes living in Lower, Upper, and Greater Germania were referred to using this label by Roman scribes.  The Roman use of the term "Germanic" was not necessarily based upon language, but referred to the tribal groups and alliances that lived in the regions of modern-day Luxembourg, Belgium, Northern France, Alsace, Poland, Austria, the Netherlands and Germany, and which were considered less civilized and more physically hardened than the Celtic Gauls. 

Ganges<====>12448<====>Ganges The Ganges (   ), also known as Ganga ( ), is a trans-boundary river of Asia which flows through the nations of India and Bangladesh.  The   river rises in the eastern Himalayas in the Indian state of Uttarakhand, and flows south and east through the Gangetic Plain of North India.   After entering West Bengal, it is divided into two rivers, one is Hugly river or Adi Ganga, flowing through several districts of West Bengal and finally submerged with Bay of Bengal near Ganga Sagar.  The second part is named as Padma which flows into Bangladesh, where it empties into the Bay of Bengal. 

Mobile Suit Gundam Wing<====>12449<====>Mobile Suit Gundam WingMobile Suit Gundam Wing, also known in Japan as  , is a 1995 Japanese mecha anime series directed by Masashi Ikeda and written by Katsuyuki Sumizawa.  It is the sixth installment in the Gundam franchise, taking place in the "After Colony" timeline.   As with the original series, the plot of Gundam Wing centers on a war in the future (specifically the 2220s) between Earth and its orbital colonies in the Earth-Moon system. The series aired in Japan on the terrestrial TV Asahi network. 

Gödel's completeness theorem<====>12450<====>Gödel's completeness theoremGödel's completeness theorem is a fundamental theorem in mathematical logic that establishes a correspondence between semantic truth and syntactic provability in first-order logic.  It makes a close link between model theory that deals with what is true in different models, and proof theory that studies what can be formally proven in particular formal systems. It was first proved by Kurt Gödel in 1929.  It was then simplified in 1947, when Leon Henkin observed in his Ph. D.  thesis that the hard part of the proof can be presented as the Model Existence Theorem (published in 1949). 

Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point<====>12451<====>Global Boundary Stratotype Section and PointA Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point, abbreviated GSSP, is an internationally agreed upon reference point on a stratigraphic section which defines the lower boundary of a stage on the geologic time scale.   The effort to define GSSPs is conducted by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, a part of the International Union of Geological Sciences.   Most, but not all, GSSPs are based on paleontological changes.   Hence GSSPs are usually described in terms of transitions between different faunal stages, though far more faunal stages have been described than GSSPs.   The GSSP definition effort commenced in 1977. 

Gough Whitlam<====>12454<====>Gough Whitlam    Edward Gough Whitlam   (  11 July 1916 21 October 2014) was the 21st Prime Minister of Australia, serving from 1972 to 1975.  The Leader of the Labor Party from 1967 to 1977, Whitlam led his party to power for the first time in 23 years at the 1972 election.  He won the 1974 election before being controversially dismissed by the Governor-General of Australia, Sir John Kerr, at the climax of the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis.  Whitlam remains the only Australian prime minister to have his commission terminated in that manner. 

Geri and Freki<====>12457<====>Geri and FrekiIn Norse mythology, Geri and Freki (Old Norse, both meaning "the ravenous" or "greedy one") are two wolves which are said to accompany the god Odin.  They are attested in the Poetic Edda, a collection of epic poetry compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in the poetry of skalds.  The pair has been compared to similar figures found in Greek, Roman and Vedic mythology, and may also be connected to beliefs surrounding the Germanic "wolf-warrior bands", the Úlfhéðnar. EtymologyThe names Geri and Freki have been interpreted as meaning either "the greedy one" or "the ravenous one". 

Ginnungagap<====>12458<====>Ginnungagap In Norse mythology, Ginnungagap ("gaping abyss", "yawning void") is  the  primordial void, mentioned in the Gylfaginning, the Eddaic text recording Norse cosmogony.  EtymologyGinnunga- is usually interpreted as deriving from a verb meaning "gape" or "yawn", but no such word occurs in Old Norse except in verse 3 of the Eddic poem "Vǫluspá", "gap var ginnunga", which may be a play on the term.  In her edition of the poem, Ursula Dronke suggested it was borrowed from Old High German ginunga, as the term Múspell is believed to have been borrowed from Old High German.   An alternative etymology links the ginn- prefix  with that found in terms with a sacral meaning, such as ginn-heilagr, ginn-regin (both referring to the gods) and ginn-runa (referring to the runes), thus interpreting Ginnungagap as signifying a "magical (and creative) power-filled space". 

Green<====>12460<====>GreenGreen is the color between blue and yellow on the visible spectrum.  It is evoked by light which has a dominant wavelength of roughly 495 570 nm.  In subtractive color systems,  used in painting and color printing, it is created by a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model, used on television and computer screens, it is one of the additive primary colors, along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors.   By far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll, the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy. 

Gradient<====>12461<====>Gradient  In mathematics, the gradient is a multi-variable generalization of the derivative.   While a derivative can be defined on functions of a single variable, for functions of several variables, the gradient takes its place.   The gradient is a vector-valued function, as opposed to a derivative, which is scalar-valued. Like the derivative, the gradient represents the slope of the tangent of the graph of the function.  More precisely, the gradient points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the function, and its magnitude is the slope of the graph in that direction. 

Gauss (unit)<====>12462<====>Gauss (unit)The gauss, abbreviated as G or Gs, is the cgs unit of measurement of magnetic flux density (or "magnetic induction") (B).  It is named after German mathematician and physicist Carl Friedrich Gauss.  One gauss is defined as one  maxwell per square centimeter.  The cgs system has been superseded by the International System of Units (SI), which uses the tesla (unit T) as the unit of magnetic flux density.   One gauss equals 1  tesla (100 μT), so 1 tesla = 10,000 gauss. Unit name and conventionAs with all units whose names are derived from a person's name, the first letter of its symbol is uppercase ("G"), but when the unit is spelled out, it should be written in lowercase ("gauss"), unless it begins a sentence. 

Glacier<====>12463<====>Glacier   A glacier (  or  ) is a persistent body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and sublimation) over many years, often centuries.  Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features.  They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines.  Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water. 

Gylfaginning<====>12464<====>Gylfaginning Gylfaginning ( Old Norse pronunciation  [ˈgʏlvaˌgɪnːɪŋg];  ; either Tricking of Gylfi or Gylfi's empowerment; c.  20,000 words), is the first part of Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda after Prologue.  The Gylfaginning deals with the creation and destruction of the world of the Norse gods, and many other aspects of Norse mythology.  The second part of the Prose Edda is called the Skáldskaparmál and the third Háttatal. SummaryThe Gylfaginning tells the story of Gylfi, a king of "the land that men now call Sweden", who after being tricked by one of the goddesses of the Æsir, wonders if all Æsir use magic and tricks for their will to be done. 

Glorious Revolution<====>12466<====>Glorious Revolution The Glorious Revolution, also called the Revolution of 1688, was the overthrow of King James II of England (James VII of Scotland) by a union of English Parliamentarians with the Dutch stadtholder William III, Prince of Orange.   William's successful invasion of England with a Dutch fleet and army led to his ascension to the throne as William III of England jointly with his wife, Mary II, James's daughter, after the Declaration of Right, leading to the Bill of Rights 1689. King James's policies of religious tolerance after 1685 met with increasing opposition from members of leading political circles, who were troubled by the King's Catholicism and his close ties with France. 

Great Lakes Colleges Association<====>12468<====>Great Lakes Colleges AssociationThe Great Lakes Colleges Association (GLCA) is a consortium of 13 liberal arts colleges located in the states around the Great Lakes. The 13 schools are located in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Indiana.  It was chartered in the state of Michigan and incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in 1962, the consortium extended its first offer of membership in 46 years to Allegheny College in 2008.The GLCA offices are located in Ann Arbor, Michigan.Member institutions are:Albion CollegeAntioch CollegeAllegheny CollegeDenison UniversityDePauw UniversityEarlham CollegeHope CollegeKalamazoo CollegeKenyon CollegeOberlin CollegeOhio Wesleyan UniversityWabash CollegeCollege of WoosterExternal links  

Goidelic languages<====>12469<====>Goidelic languages   The Goidelic   or Gaelic languages ( ;  ;  ) form one of the two groups of Insular Celtic languages, the other being the Brittonic languages.  Goidelic languages historically formed a dialect continuum stretching from Ireland through the Isle of Man to Scotland.  There are three modern Goidelic languages: Irish ( ), Scottish Gaelic ( ) and Manx ( ), the last of which died out in the 20th century but has since been revived to some degree.  NomenclatureAlthough Irish and Manx are often referred to as Irish Gaelic and Manx Gaelic (as they are Goidelic or Gaelic languages), the use of the word Gaelic is unnecessary because the terms Irish and Manx, to refer to language (as in, "to speak Irish"), always refer to these languages, but Scots has come to refer to a Germanic language and so "Scottish" can refer to things that are not Gaelic at all. 

Gnosticism<====>12471<====>Gnosticism   Gnosticism (from   gnostikos, "having knowledge", from    , knowledge) is a modern name for a variety of ancient religious ideas and systems, originating in Jewish milieus in the first and second century AD.  Based on their readings of the Torah and other Biblical writings,  these systems believed that the material world is created by an emanation of the highest God, trapping the Divine spark within the human body.  This Divine spark could be liberated by gnosis of this Divine spark. The Gnostic ideas and systems flourished in the Mediterranean world in the second century AD, in conjunction with and influenced by the early Christian movements and Middle Platonism. 

Gregor Aichinger<====>12472<====>Gregor AichingerGregor Aichinger (c.  1565 – 21 January 1628) was a German composer. LifeHe was organist to the Fugger family of Augsburg in 1584.In 1599 he went for a two-year visit to Rome for musical, rather than religious reasons, although he had taken holy orders before his appointment under the Fuggers.  Proske, in the preface to vol.  2 of his Musica Divina, calls him a priest of Regensburg, and is inclined to give him the palm for the devout and ingenuous mastery of his style.  Certainly this impression is fully borne out by the beautiful and somewhat quaint works included in that great anthology. 

Gospel of Barnabas<====>12474<====>Gospel of Barnabas The Gospel of Barnabas is a book depicting the life of Jesus, which claims to be by the biblical Barnabas who in this work is one of the twelve apostles.  Two manuscripts are known to have existed, both dated to the late 16th or early 17th centuries, with one written in Italian and the other in Spanish.  The Spanish manuscript is now lost, its text surviving only in a partial 18th-century transcript.Barnabas is about the same length as the four canonical gospels put together, with the bulk being devoted to an account of Jesus' ministry, much of it harmonized from accounts also found in the canonical gospels. 

Georgius Agricola<====>12475<====>Georgius Agricola   	Georgius Agricola ( ; 24 March 1494 – 21 November 1555) was a German mineralogist and metallurgist.  He is known as "the father of mineralogy",  he was born at Glauchau in Saxony.  His birth name was Georg Pawer (Bauer in modern German);  Agricola is the Latinized version of his name, by which he was known his entire adult life; Agricola and Bauer mean "farmer" in their respective languages.  He is best known for his book De Re Metallica (1556). Life and workGifted with a precocious intellect, Agricola early threw himself into the pursuit of the "new learning", with such effect that at the age of 24, he was appointed Rector extraordinarius of Greek at the so-called Great School of Zwickau, and made his appearance as a writer on philology. 

Germanicus<====>12478<====>Germanicus   Germanicus (Latin: Germanicus Julius Caesar; 24 May 15 BC – 10 October AD 19) was a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and a prominent general of the Roman Empire known for his campaigns in Germania.  The son of Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia Minor, Germanicus was born into a prominent branch of the patrician gens Claudia.  The agnomen Germanicus was added to his full name in 9 BC when it was posthumously awarded to his father in honor of his victories in Germania.  In AD 4, he was adopted by his paternal uncle, Tiberius who succeeded Augustus as Roman emperor a decade later. 

Giulio Alberoni<====>12479<====>Giulio AlberoniGiulio Alberoni (30 May 1664 OS – 26 June NS 1752) was an Italian cardinal andstatesman in the service of Philip V of Spain.

Giovanni Aldini<====>12481<====>Giovanni Aldini Giovanni Aldini (April 10, 1762 – January 17, 1834), was an Italian physicist born in Bologna.  He was a brother of the statesman Count Antonio Aldini (1756–1826) and nephew of Luigi Galvani, whose treaties on muscular electricity he edited with notes in 1791. He became professor of physics at Bologna in 1798, in succession to his uncle Luigi Galvani (1734–1819).    His scientific work was chiefly concerned with galvanism, anatomy and its medical applications, with the construction and illumination of lighthouses, and with experiments for preserving human life and material objects from destruction by fire.

LifeAleandro was born on 13 February 1480 in Motta di Livenza, in the province of Treviso, part of the Republic of Venice.  He studied in Venice, where he became acquainted with Erasmus and Aldus Manutius, and at an early age was reputed one of the most learned men of the time.  In 1508 he went to Paris on the invitation of Louis XII as professor of belles lettres, and held for a time the position of Rector of the University of Paris. 

Galeazzo Alessi<====>12483<====>Galeazzo AlessiGaleazzo Alessi (1512 – December 30, 1572) was an Italian architect from Perugia, known throughout Europe for his distinctive style based on his enthusiasm for ancient architecture.  He studied drawing for civil and military architecture under the direction of Giovanni Battista Caporali. For a number of years he lived in Genoa.  He was involved in the lay-out of the streets and the restoration of the city walls, as well as being responsible for many of its impressive palazzi, now a part of the World Heritage List.  His work can be found in many other Italian cities, including in Ferrara, Bologna, Naples and Milan, where he designed the facade of Santa Maria presso San Celso.

German cuisine<====>12485<====>German cuisineFor various examples of cuisine, see List of German dishes. The cuisine of Germany has evolved as a national cuisine through centuries of social and political change with variations from region to region. Some regions of Germany, like Bavaria and neighbouring Swabia, share dishes with Austrian and parts of Swiss cuisine.    The Michelin Guide of 2015 awarded eleven restaurants in Germany three stars, the highest designation, while 38 more received two stars and 233 one star.   German restaurants have become the world's second-most decorated after France.   Hot foodsMeatPork, beef, and poultry are the main varieties of meat consumed in Germany, pork being the most popular. 

Greek cuisine<====>12486<====>Greek cuisine   Greek cuisine ( , Elliniki kouzina) is a Mediterranean cuisine.  Spices and Seasonings:A Food Technology Handbook - Donna R.  Tainter, Anthony T.  Grenis, p.  223  Contemporary Greek cookery makes wide use of vegetables, olive oil, grains, fish, wine, and meat (white and red, including lamb, poultry, rabbit and pork).  Other important ingredients include olives, cheese, eggplant, zucchini, lemon juice, vegetables, herbs, bread and yoghurt.  The most commonly used grain is wheat; barley is also used.  Common dessert ingredients include nuts, honey, fruits, and filo pastry.  It is also influenced by Persian and Turkish cuisine because of approximately 200 years of Achaemenid and 400 years of Ottoman government. 

Gospel of Mark<====>12490<====>Gospel of Mark  The Gospel According to Mark ( , to kata Markon euangelion), is one of the four canonical gospels and one of the three synoptic gospels.  It tells of the ministry of Jesus from his baptism by John the Baptist to his death and burial and the discovery of the empty tomb – there is no genealogy of Jesus or birth narrative, nor, in the original ending at chapter 16, any post-resurrection appearances.  It portrays Jesus as a heroic man of action, an exorcist, a healer, and a miracle worker.  Jesus is also the Son of God, but he keeps his identity secret (the Messianic Secret), concealing it in parables so that even the disciples fail to understand. 

Gospel of Luke<====>12491<====>Gospel of Luke  The Gospel According to Luke ( , to kata Loukan evangelion), also called the Gospel of Luke, or simply Luke, is the third of the four canonical Gospels.  It tells of the origins, birth, ministry, atonement, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ.  Luke is the second-longest of the four gospels, and together with Acts of the Apostles, the pair make up a two-volume work from the same pen, called Luke–Acts.   The cornerstone of Luke–Acts' theology is "salvation history", the author's understanding that God's purpose is seen in the way he has acted, and will continue to act, in history. 

Gospel of Matthew<====>12492<====>Gospel of Matthew    The Gospel According to Matthew ( ) Also called the Gospel of Matthew or simply, Matthew)  is the first book of the New Testament and one of the three synoptic gospels.  It tells how the Messiah, Jesus, rejected by Israel, finally sends the disciples to preach the gospel to the whole world.   Most scholars believe it was composed between AD 80 and 90, with a range of possibility between AD 70 to 110 (a pre-70 date remains a minority view).    The anonymous author was probably a male Jew, standing on the margin between traditional and non-traditional Jewish values, and familiar with technical legal aspects of scripture being debated in his time. 

Gospel of John<====>12493<====>Gospel of JohnThe Gospel According to John ( ; also called the Gospel of John, the Fourth Gospel, or simply John) is one of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament.  It traditionally appears fourth, after the Synoptic Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Although the Gospel of John is anonymous,  Christian tradition historically has attributed it to John the Apostle, son of Zebedee and one of Jesus' Twelve Apostles.  The gospel is so closely related in style and content to the three surviving Johannine epistles that commentators treat the four books,  along with the Book of Revelation, as a single corpus of Johannine literature, albeit not necessarily written by the same author. 

Grover Cleveland<====>12495<====>Grover Cleveland   Stephen Grover Cleveland (March 18, 1837 June 24, 1908) was an American politician and lawyer who was the 22nd and 24th President of the United States, the only President in American history to serve two non-consecutive terms in office (1885 89 and 1893 97).   He won the popular vote for three presidential elections in 1884, 1888, and 1892 and was one of two Democrats (with Woodrow Wilson) to be elected president during the era of Republican political domination dating from 1861 to 1933. Cleveland was the leader of the pro-business Bourbon Democrats who opposed high tariffs, Free Silver, inflation, imperialism, and subsidies to business, farmers, or veterans on libertarian philosophical grounds.

His contemporaries referred to him  as iuris canonici fons et tuba ("the fount and trumpet of canon law").  Most important among his works were extensive commentaries on all of the official collections of papal decretals, papal judgments in the form of letters to delegated judges that were at the core of canon law. LifeGiovanni d'Andrea was born at Rifredo, near Florence, and studied Roman law and canon law at the University of Bologna, the great law school of the age, where he distinguished himself in this subject so much that he was made professor at Padua, and then at Pisa before returning to Bologna, where he remained from the season of 1301-02 until his death, save for brief seasons at Padua 1307-09 and 1319. 

Galilean moons<====>12505<====>Galilean moonsThe Galilean moons are the four largest moons of Jupiter—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.  They were first seen by Galileo Galilei in January 1610, and recognized by him as satellites of Jupiter in March 1610.   They are the first objects found to orbit another planet.  Their names derive from the lovers of Zeus.  They are among the largest objects in the Solar System with the exception of the Sun and the eight planets, with a radius larger than any of the dwarf planets.  Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System, and is even bigger than the planet Mercury.

Ghost<====>12514<====>GhostIn folklore, a ghost (sometimes known as an apparition, haunt, phantom, poltergeist, shade, specter or spectre, spirit, spook, and wraith) is the soul or spirit of a dead person or animal that can appear to the living.  Descriptions of ghosts vary widely from an invisible presence to translucent or barely visible wispy shapes, to realistic, lifelike visions.  The deliberate attempt to contact the spirit of a deceased person is known as necromancy, or in spiritism as a séance. The belief in the existence of an afterlife, as well as manifestations of the spirits of the dead is widespread, dating back to animism or ancestor worship in pre-literate cultures.

Cis–trans isomerism<====>12528<====>Cis–trans isomerismDISPLAYTITLE Cis–trans isomerism, also known as geometric isomerism or configurational isomerism, is a term used in organic chemistry.  The prefixes "cis" and "trans" are from Latin.  In the context of chemistry, cis indicates that the functional groups are on the same side of the carbon chain  while trans conveys that functional groups are on opposing sides of the carbon chain.  Cis-trans isomers are stereoisomers, that is, pairs of molecules which have the same formula but whose functional groups are rotated into a different orientation in three-dimensional space.  It is not to be confused with E–Z isomerism, which is an absolute stereochemical description, and only to be used with alkenes. 

Grímnismál<====>12529<====>Grímnismál Grímnismál (Sayings of Grímnir) is one of the mythological poems of the Poetic Edda.  It is preserved in the Codex Regius manuscript and the AM 748 I 4to fragment.  It is spoken through the voice of Grímnir, one of the many guises of the god Odin.  The very name suggests guise, or mask or hood.  Through an error, King Geirröth tortured Odin-as-Grímnir, a fatal mistake, since Odin caused him to fall upon his own sword.  The poem is written mostly in the ljóðaháttr metre,  typical for wisdom verse. Structure and historyThe work starts out with a lengthy prose section describing the circumstances leading up to Grímnir's monologue.

Geocaching<====>12533<====>Geocaching   Geocaching   is an outdoor recreational activity, in which participants use a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver or mobile device and other navigational techniques to hide and seek containers, called "geocaches" or "caches", at specific locations marked by coordinates all over the world. A typical cache is a small waterproof container containing a logbook and sometimes a pen or pencil.  The geocacher signs the log with their established code name and dates it, in order to prove that they found the cache.  After signing the log, the cache must be placed back exactly where the person found it. 

Geographical mile<====>12534<====>Geographical mile  The geographical mile is a unit of length determined by 1 minute of arc along the Earth's equator.   For the 1924 International Spheroid this equalled 1855. 4 metres. Any greater precision depends more on choice of standard than on more careful measurement: the length of the equator in the World Geodetic System WGS-84 is   which makes the geographical mile 1855. 3248 m, while the International Astronomical Union standard IAU-2000 takes the equator to be   making the geographical mile 1855. 3257 m, almost a millimetre longer.  In any standard, the length of a degree of longitude at the equator is thus exactly 60 geographical miles. 

Golden Heroes<====>12535<====>Golden Heroes Golden Heroes is a superhero role-playing game that was originally written and published on an amateur basis in 1982.  Games Workshop then published a more complete version in 1984.   It was written by Simon Burley and Peter Haines and was illustrated by a group of artists who were working for 2000 AD at the time. DescriptionThe game was published in a box, the rules books features fake bar codes and Comics Code approval badges. The character generation system involves players rolling completely random characters.  A character can only keep his full set of powers if he can justify them all in a plausible origins story.

Located on the Pearl River about   north-northwest of Hong Kong and   north of Macau, Guangzhou has a history of over 2,200 years and was a major terminus of the maritime Silk Road  and continues to serve as a major port and transportation hub today.    Guangzhou is situated at the heart of the most-populous built-up metropolitan area in mainland China, an area that extends into the neighboring cities of Foshan, Dongguan, and Shenzhen, forming one of the largest urban agglomerations on the planet. 

Genitive case<====>12539<====>Genitive case In grammar, genitive (abbreviated  ;  also called the possessive case or second case) is the grammatical case that marks a noun as modifying another noun.  It often marks a noun as being the possessor of another noun.   However, it can also indicate various relationships other than possession: certain verbs may take arguments in the genitive case, and it may have adverbial uses (see Adverbial genitive). Placing the modifying noun in the genitive case is one way to indicate that two nouns are related in a genitive construction.  Modern English typically does not morphologically mark nouns for a genitive case in order to indicate a genitive construction; instead, it uses either the   clitic or a preposition (usually of). 

Gematria<====>12541<====>GematriaGematria   (   , plural   or  , gematriot)  originated as an Assyro-Babylonian-Greek system of alphanumeric code or cipher later adopted into Jewish culture that assigns numerical value to a word, name, or phrase in the belief that words or phrases with identical numerical values bear some relation to each other or bear some relation to the number itself as it may apply to Nature, a person's age, the calendar year, or the like.  A single word can yield multiple values depending on the system used. Similar systems, some of which were derived from or inspired by Hebrew gematria, have been used in other languages and cultures, i. 

Grateful Dead<====>12542<====>Grateful Dead   The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of rock, psychedelia, experimental music, modal jazz, country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, and space rock,   for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams,  and for their devoted fan base, known as "Deadheads".  "Their music," writes Lenny Kaye, "touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists. "    These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead "the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world". 

Groupoid<====>12543<====>Groupoid  In mathematics, especially in category theory and homotopy theory, a groupoid (less often Brandt groupoid or virtual group) generalises the notion of group in several equivalent ways.  A groupoid can be seen as a:Group with a partial function replacing the binary operation;Category in which every morphism is invertible.  A category of this sort can be viewed as augmented with a unary operation, called inverse by analogy with group theory.Notice that a groupoid where there is only one object is a usual group. Special cases include:Setoids, that is: sets that come with an equivalence relation;G-sets, sets equipped with an action of a group  G . 

Galliard<====>12544<====>Galliard The galliard ( ;  ;  ) was a form of Renaissance dance and music popular all over Europe in the 16th century.  It is mentioned in dance manuals from England, France, Spain, Germany, and Italy. Dance formAs a dance, the galliard was definitely not one to be improvised.  It had dancers combining patterns of steps which occupy one or more measures of music.  In one measure, a galliard typically has five steps; in French such a basic step is called a cinq pas and in Italy, cinque passi.  This is sometimes written in English sources as sinkapace. 

General surgery<====>12545<====>General surgery  General surgery is a surgical specialty that focuses on abdominal contents including esophagus, stomach, small bowel, colon, liver, pancreas, gallbladder, appendix and bile ducts, and often the thyroid gland (depending on local referral patterns).  They also deal with diseases involving the skin, breast, soft tissue, trauma, peripheral vascular surgery and hernias and perform endoscopic procedures such as gastroscopy and colonoscopy. ScopeGeneral surgeons may sub-specialize into one or more of the following disciplines:Trauma surgery/ Surgical Critical Care In many parts of the world including North America, [[Australia]] and the United Kingdom, the overall responsibility for trauma care falls under the auspices of general surgery. 

Gorilla<====>12546<====>Gorilla  Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa.  The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas (both critically endangered), and either four or five subspecies.  They are the largest living primates.  The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95–99% depending on what is counted, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the chimpanzees and bonobos. Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forests in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Although their range covers a small percentage of Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations.

Gallifrey<====>12550<====>Gallifrey   Gallifrey (  or  ) is a planet in the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who.  It is the original home world of the Time Lords, including the Doctor, the Master and the Rani.  It was located in a binary star system    within the constellation of Kasterborous, at "galactic coordinates ten-zero-eleven-zero-zero by zero-two from galactic zero centre". During the first decade of the television series, the name of the Doctor's home planet was not revealed, although it was actually shown for the first time in The War Games (1969) during the Second Doctor's trial. 

Gymnastics<====>12551<====>GymnasticsGymnastics is a sport practiced by men and women that requires balance, strength, flexibility, agility, coordination, endurance and control.  The movements involved in gymnastics contribute to the development of the arms, legs, shoulders, back, chest and abdominal muscle groups.  Alertness, precision, daring, self-confidence and self-discipline are mental traits that can also be developed through gymnastics.   Gymnastics evolved from exercises used by the ancient Greeks that included skills for mounting and dismounting a horse, and from circus performance skills. Most forms of competitive gymnastics events are governed by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG).  Each country has its own national governing body (BIW) affiliated to FIG. 

Great auk<====>12552<====>Great auk    The great auk (Pinguinus impennis) is a species of flightless alcid that became extinct in the mid-19th century.  It was the only modern species in the genus Pinguinus.  It is unrelated to the birds now known as penguins, which were discovered later and so named by sailors because of their physical resemblance to the great auk. It bred on rocky, isolated islands with easy access to the ocean and a plentiful food supply, a rarity in nature that provided only a few breeding sites for the great auks.  When not breeding, they spent their time foraging in the waters of the North Atlantic, ranging as far south as northern Spain and along the coastlines of Canada, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Norway, Ireland, and Great Britain. 

Glorantha<====>12553<====>Glorantha Glorantha is a fantasy world created by Greg Stafford.  It was first introduced in the board game White Bear and Red Moon (1975) by Chaosium, and thereafter in a number of other board, roleplaying and computer games, including RuneQuest and HeroQuest, as well as several works of fiction and the computer strategy game King of Dragon Pass.   The Gloranthan world is characterised by its complex use of mythology, heavily influenced by the universalist approaches of Joseph Campbell and Mircea Eliade, its Howardian ethos, its long and distinctive history as a setting for role-playing games, its community development and expansion, and (unusual among early American fantasy role-playing games) its relative lack of Tolkienesque influence.

See also: "Difference and Repetition is definitely the most important work published by Deleuze. " (Edouard Morot-Sir, from the back cover of the first edition of the English translation), or James Williams' judgment: "It is nothing less than a revolution in philosophy and stands out as one of the great philosophical works of the twentieth century" (James Williams, Gilles Deleuze's Difference and Repetition: A Critical Introduction and Guide [Edinburgh UP, 2003], p. 

Galaxy<====>12558<====>Galaxy    A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter.    The word galaxy is derived from the Greek   ( ), literally "milky", a reference to the Milky Way.  Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred million ( ) stars to giants with one hundred trillion ( ) stars,  each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical,  spiral, or irregular.   Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers.

Grappling<====>12564<====>Grappling  In hand-to-hand combat, grappling is a close fighting technique used to gain a physical advantage such as improving relative position, or causing injury to the opponent.  Grappling covers techniques used in many disciplines, styles and martial arts that are practiced both as combat sports and for self-defense.  Grappling most commonly does not include striking or the use of weapons.  However, some fighting styles or martial arts known especially for their grappling techniques teach tactics that include strikes and weapons either alongside grappling or combined with it.  Types ofGrappling techniques can be broadly subdivided into Clinch fighting; Takedowns and Throws; Submission holds and Pinning or Controlling Techniques; and Sweeps, Reversals, Turnovers, and Escapes. 

George Mason University<====>12566<====>George Mason University George Mason University (Mason) is the largest public research university in the U. S.  state of Virginia.   The university was founded as a branch of the University of Virginia in 1949 and became an independent institution in 1972.    Four campuses are located in Virginia, with another in Songdo, South Korea inside the Incheon Free Economic Zone.  Three of the four campuses within Virginia are within the Northern Virginia section of the Piedmont, and one is in the Blue Ridge Mountains region.  On-campus housing options exist at all campus locations except Arlington. 

Grammar<====>12569<====>Grammar    In linguistics, grammar (from Greek:  ) is the set of structural rules governing the composition of clauses, phrases, and words in any given natural language.  The term refers also to the study of such rules, and this field includes phonology, morphology, and syntax, often complemented by phonetics, semantics, and pragmatics. Use of the termFor linguists, grammar refers to cognitive information underlying language use.  Speakers of a language have a set of internalized rules  for using that language.  These rules constitute grammar, and the vast majority of the information in the grammar is—at least in the case of one's native language—acquired not by conscious study or instruction, but by observing other speakers. 

Gigabyte<====>12570<====>Gigabyte  The gigabyte (    or   ) is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information.  The prefix giga means 10 9  in the International System of Units (SI).  Therefore, one gigabyte is  .   The unit symbol for the gigabyte is GB. This definition is used in all contexts of science, engineering, business, and many areas of computing, including hard drive, solid state drive, and tape capacities, as well as data transmission speeds.  However, the term is also used in some fields of computer science and information technology to denote   (1024 3  or 2 30 ) bytes, particularly for sizes of RAM. 

Galaxy groups and clusters<====>12571<====>Galaxy groups and clustersGalaxy groups and clusters are the largest known gravitationally bound objects to have arisen thus far in the process of cosmic structure formation.   They form the densest part of the large-scale structure of the Universe.  In models for the gravitational formation of structure with cold dark matter, the smallest structures collapse first and eventually build the largest structures, clusters of galaxies.  Clusters are then formed relatively recently between 10 billion years ago and now.  Groups and clusters may contain ten to thousands of individual galaxies.  The clusters themselves are often associated with larger, non-gravitationally bound, groups called superclusters. 

Grus (constellation)<====>12572<====>Grus (constellation)   Grus ( , or colloquially  ) is a constellation in the southern sky.  Its name is Latin for the crane, a type of bird.  It is one of twelve constellations conceived by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman.  Grus first appeared on a 35-cm (14 in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and was depicted in Johann Bayer's star atlas Uranometria of 1603.   French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille gave Bayer designations to its stars in 1756, some of which had been previously considered part of the neighbouring constellation Piscis Austrinus. 

Galba<====>12576<====>Galba    Galba ( ; Classical Latin spelling and reconstructed Classical Latin pronunciation:; 24 December 3 BC – 15 January 69 AD) was Roman emperor for seven months from 68 to 69.  The governor of Hispania Tarraconensis at the time of the rebellion of Julius Vindex in Gaul, he seized the throne following Nero's suicide. Born into a wealthy family, Galba was a capable military officer during the first half of the first century AD.  He retired during Nero's reign but was later granted the governorship of Hispania Tarraconensis.  Taking advantage of the defeat of Vindex's rebellion and Nero's suicide, he became emperor with the support of the Praetorian Guard. 

Giga-<====>12577<====>Giga- Giga (  or  ) is a unit prefix in the metric system denoting a factor of a (short-form) billion (10 9  or  ).  It has the symbol G. Giga is derived from the Greek word  , meaning " ".  The Oxford English Dictionary reports the earliest written use of giga in this sense to be in the Reports of the IUPAC 14th Conference in 1947: "The following prefixes to abbreviations for the names of units should be used: G giga 10 9 ×".  When referring to information units in computing, such as gigabyte, giga may sometimes mean   (2 30 ), although such use is inconsistent, contrary to standards and has been discouraged by the standards organizations. 

George Stephenson<====>12578<====>George Stephenson    George Stephenson (9 June 1781 – 12 August 1848) was an English civil engineer and mechanical engineer.  Renowned as the "Father of Railways",  Stephenson was considered by the Victorians a great example of diligent application and thirst for improvement.  Self-help advocate Samuel Smiles particularly praised his achievements.  His rail gauge of  , sometimes called "Stephenson gauge", is the standard gauge by name and by convention for most of the world's railways. Pioneered by Stephenson, rail transport was one of the most important technological inventions of the 19th century and a key component of the Industrial Revolution. 

Grapheme<====>12579<====>Grapheme    In linguistics, a grapheme is the smallest unit of a writing system of any given language.   An individual grapheme may or may not carry meaning by itself, and may or may not correspond to a single phoneme of the spoken language.  Graphemes include alphabetic letters, typographic ligatures, Chinese characters, numerical digits, punctuation marks, and other individual symbols.  It can also be construed as a graphical sign that independently represents a portion of linguistic material.  The word grapheme, coined in analogy with phoneme, is derived  , and the suffix -eme, by analogy with phoneme and other names of emic units. 

Glass<====>12581<====>GlassGlass is a non-crystalline amorphous solid that is often transparent and has widespread practical, technological, and decorative usage in, for example, window panes, tableware, and optoelectronics.  The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of glass are "silicate glasses" based on the chemical compound silica (silicon dioxide, or quartz), the primary constituent of sand.   The term glass, in popular usage, is often used to refer only to this type of material, which is familiar from use as window glass and in glass bottles.  Of the many silica-based glasses that exist, ordinary glazing and container glass is formed from a specific type called soda-lime glass, composed of approximately 75% silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ), sodium oxide (Na 2 O) from sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3 ), calcium oxide, also called lime (CaO), and several minor additives. 

Gel electrophoresis<====>12582<====>Gel electrophoresis  Gel electrophoresis is a method for separation and analysis of macromolecules (DNA, RNA and proteins) and their fragments, based on their size and charge.  It is used in clinical chemistry to separate proteins by charge and/or size (IEF agarose, essentially size independent) and in biochemistry and molecular biology to separate a mixed population of DNA and RNA fragments by length, to estimate the size of DNA and RNA fragments or to separate proteins by charge.  Nucleic acid molecules are separated by applying an electric field to move the negatively charged molecules through a matrix of agarose or other substances. 

Gary Lineker<====>12583<====>Gary Lineker  Gary Winston Lineker, OBE ( ; born 30 November 1960) is an English retired footballer and current sports broadcaster.  He holds England's record for goals in FIFA World Cup finals, with 10 scored.  Lineker's media career began with the BBC, where he has presented the flagship programme Match of the Day since the late 1990s.  He has also worked for Al Jazeera Sports, Eredivisie Live, NBC Sports Network and currently hosts BT Sport's coverage of the UEFA Champions League. Lineker began his football career at Leicester City in 1978, and finished as the First Division's joint top goalscorer in 1984–85. 

Golgi apparatus<====>12584<====>Golgi apparatus   The Golgi apparatus, also known as the Golgi complex, Golgi body, or simply the Golgi, is an organelle found in most eukaryotic cells.It was identified in 1897 by the Italian scientist Camillo Golgi and named after him in 1898.    Part of the endomembrane system in the cytoplasm, the Golgi apparatus packages proteins into membrane-bound vesicles inside the cell before the vesicles are sent to their destination.  The Golgi apparatus resides at the intersection of the secretory, lysosomal, and endocytic pathways.  It is of particular importance in processing proteins for secretion, containing a set of glycosylation enzymes that attach various sugar monomers to proteins as the proteins move through the apparatus. 

Grace Hopper<====>12590<====>Grace Hopper  Grace Brewster Murray Hopper ( ; December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral.   One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first compiler related tools.   She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today. Hopper had attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II, but she was rejected by the military because she was 34 years of age and too old to enlist. 

GNU Manifesto<====>12592<====>GNU Manifesto  The GNU Manifesto was written by Richard Stallman and published in March 1985 in Dr.  Dobb's Journal of Software Tools  as an explanation and definition of the goals of the GNU Project, and to call for participation and support developing GNU, a free software computer operating system.   It is held in high regard within the free software movement as a fundamental philosophical source.  The full text is included with GNU software such as Emacs, and is publicly available.    SummaryThe GNU Manifesto begins by outlining the goal of the project GNU, which stands for GNU's Not Unix. 

Gross domestic product<====>12594<====>Gross domestic product Gross domestic product  (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced in a period (quarterly or yearly) of time.  Nominal GDP estimates are commonly used to determine the economic performance of a whole country or region, and to make international comparisons.  Nominal GDP per capita does not, however, reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries; therefore using a basis of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) is arguably more useful when comparing differences in living standards between nations. 

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel<====>12598<====>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel  Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel ( ;   ; August 27, 1770 – November 14, 1831) was a German philosopher and an important figure of German idealism.  He achieved wide renown in his day and, while primarily influential within the continental tradition of philosophy, has become increasingly influential in the analytic tradition as well.   Although Hegel remains a divisive figure, his canonical stature within Western philosophy is universally recognized. Hegel's principal achievement is his development of a distinctive articulation of idealism sometimes termed "absolute idealism",  in which the dualisms of, for instance, mind and nature and subject and object are overcome. 

Grid network<====>12600<====>Grid network  A grid network is a computer network consisting of a number of (computer) systems connected in a grid topology. In a regular grid topology, each node in the network is connected with two neighbors along one or more dimensions.   If the network is one-dimensional, and the chain of nodes is connected to form a circular loop, the resulting topology is known as a ring.   Network systems such as FDDI use two counter-rotating token-passing rings to achieve high reliability and performance.   In general, when an n-dimensional grid network is connected circularly in more than one dimension, the resulting network topology is a torus, and the network is called "toroidal".

The Governor-General has formal presidency over the Federal Executive Council and is Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Defence Force, as well as viceregal representative in the Australian Capital Territory.  The functions of the Governor-General include appointing ministers, judges, and ambassadors; giving royal assent to legislation passed by Parliament; issuing writs for election; and bestowing Australian honours. 

Glasnost<====>12607<====>Glasnost   In the Russian language the word glasnost ( ,  ) has several general and specific meanings.  In its meaning of "publicity", in the sense "the state of being open to public knowledge", it has been used in Russian at least since the end of the eighteenth century.   In the Russian Empire of the late-19th century, the later meaning was particularly associated with reforms of the judicial system, ensuring that the press and the public could attend court hearings and that the sentence was also read out in public.  It was made popular in the 1980s by Mikhail Gorbachev as a slogan for increased government transparency. 

Geodesy<====>12608<====>Geodesy  Geodesy ( )  – also known as geodetics, geodetic engineering, or geodetics engineering – is a branch of applied mathematics  and earth sciences that deals with the measurement and representation of Earth (or any planet), including its gravitational field, in a three-dimensional time-varying space.  One subdiscipline of geodesy is concerned with the exact positioning of points on the surface of Earth.  Geodesists study geodynamical phenomena such as crustal motion, tides, and polar motion.  For this they design global and national control networks, using space and terrestrial techniques while relying on datums and coordinate systems. 

Eurogame<====>12609<====>Eurogame A Eurogame, also called a German-style board game, German game, or Euro-style game, is a class of tabletop games that generally have indirect player interaction and abstract physical components.  Euro-style games emphasize strategy while downplaying luck and conflict.  They tend to have economic themes rather than military and usually keep all the players in the game until it ends. Eurogames are sometimes contrasted with American-style board games, which generally involve more luck, conflict, and drama.  Eurogames are usually less abstract than chess, but more abstract than wargames.  Likewise, they generally require more thought and planning than party games, such as Pictionary or Trivial Pursuit, but less skill than classic strategy games, such as chess and Go. 

Grand Unified Theory<====>12610<====>Grand Unified Theory  A Grand Unified Theory (GUT) is a model in particle physics in which, at high energy, the three gauge interactions of the Standard Model which define the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions, or forces, are merged into one single force.  This unified interaction is characterized by one larger gauge symmetry and thus several force carriers, but one unified coupling constant.  If Grand Unification is realized in nature, there is the possibility of a grand unification epoch in the early universe in which the fundamental forces are not yet distinct. Models that do not unify all interactions using one simple group as the gauge symmetry, but do so using semisimple groups, can exhibit similar properties and are sometimes referred to as Grand Unified Theories as well. 

GTE<====>12611<====>GTE  GTE Corporation, formerly General Telephone & Electronics Corporation (1955–1982),  was the largest independent telephone company in the United States during the days of the Bell System.  The company operated from 1926, with roots tracing further back than that, until 2000, when it was acquired by Bell Atlantic; the combined company took the name Verizon. The Wisconsin-based Associated Telephone Utilities Company was founded in 1926; it went bankrupt in 1933 during the Great Depression, and was reorganized as General Telephone in 1934.In 1991, it acquired the third largest independent, Continental Telephone (ConTel). 

General aviation<====>12612<====>General aviation General aviation (GA) is the term for all civil aviation operations other than scheduled air services and non-scheduled air transport operations for remuneration or hire.General aviation flights range from gliders and powered parachutes to corporate business jet flights.  The majority of the world's air traffic falls into this category, and most of the world's airports serve general aviation exclusively.  iaopa. org, "What is GA?"  .  Retrieved 17 November 2012 General aviation covers a large range of activities, both commercial and non-commercial, including flying clubs, flight training, agricultural aviation, light aircraft manufacturing and maintenance. 

Gracchi<====>12615<====>Gracchi    The Gracchus brothers, Tiberius and Gaius, were Romans who both served as tribunes in the late 2nd century BC.  They attempted to pass land reform legislation that would redistribute the major aristocratic landholdings among the urban poor and veterans, in addition to other reform measures.  After achieving some early success, both were assassinated by enemies of these reforms. Early lifeThe brothers were born to a plebeian branch of the old and noble Sempronia family.  Their father was the elderly Tiberius Gracchus the Elder (or Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus) who was tribune of the plebs, praetor, consul, and censor. 

Gossip<====>12616<====>Gossip  Gossip is idle talk or rumor, especially about the personal or private affairs of others; the act is also known as dishing or tattling.  Gossip has been researched in terms of its evolutionary psychology origins.This has found gossip to be an important means by which people can monitor cooperative reputations and so maintain widespread indirect reciprocity.   Indirect reciprocity is a social interaction in which one actor helps another and is then benefited by a third party.  Gossip has also been identified by Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary biologist, as aiding social bonding in large groups.

Guitarist<====>12620<====>Guitarist  A guitarist (or a guitar player) is a person who plays the guitar.  Guitarists may play a variety of guitar family instruments such as classical guitars, acoustic guitars, electric guitars, and bass guitars.  Some guitarists accompany themselves on the guitar by singing or playing the harmonica. TechniquesThe guitarist may employ any of several methods for sounding the guitar, including finger picking, depending on the type of strings used (either nylon or steel), and including strumming with the fingers, or a guitar pick made of bone, horn, plastic, metal, felt, leather, or paper, and melodic flatpicking and finger-picking. 

Gothic fiction<====>12622<====>Gothic fiction  Gothic fiction, which is largely known by the subgenre of Gothic horror, is a genre or mode of literature and film that combines fiction and horror, death, and at times romance.  Its origin is attributed to English author Horace Walpole, with his 1764 novel The Castle of Otranto, subtitled (in its second edition) "A Gothic Story".  The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror, an extension of Romantic literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole's novel.  It originated in England in the second half of the 18th century where, following Walpole, it was further developed by Clara Reeve, Ann Radcliffe, William Thomas Beckford and Matthew Lewis. 

Gospel<====>12627<====>Gospel A gospel (a contraction of Old English "god spel" meaning "good news/glad tidings (of the kingdom of God)", comparable to Greek  , evangelion)  is a written account of the career and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.    The term originally meant the Christian message itself, but in the 2nd century it came to be used for the books in which the message was set out.   For gospel as the Christian message see the article The Gospel.   The four gospels of the New Testament — Matthew, Mark, Luke and John — are the main source of information on the life of Jesus.

Global illumination<====>12629<====>Global illumination  Global illumination    (shortened as GI), or indirect illumination, is a general name for a group of algorithms used in 3D computer graphics that are meant to add more realistic lighting to 3D scenes.  Such algorithms take into account not only the light that comes directly from a light source (direct illumination), but also subsequent cases in which light rays from the same source are reflected by other surfaces in the scene, whether reflective or not (indirect illumination). Theoretically, reflections, refractions, and shadows are all examples of global illumination, because when simulating them, one object affects the rendering of another (as opposed to an object being affected only by a direct light). 

Geometric series<====>12630<====>Geometric series  In mathematics, a geometric series is a series with a constant ratio between successive terms.   For example, the series \frac{1}{2} \,+\, \frac{1}{4} \,+\, \frac{1}{8} \,+\, \frac{1}{16} \,+\, \cdots is geometric, because each successive term can be obtained by multiplying the previous term by 1/2. Geometric series are among the simplest examples of infinite series with finite sums, although not all of them have this property.   Historically, geometric series played an important role in the early development of calculus, and they continue to be central in the study of convergence of series.   Geometric series are used throughout mathematics, and they have important applications in physics, engineering, biology, economics, computer science, queueing theory, and finance. 

List of islands of Greece<====>12634<====>List of islands of GreeceGreece has a large number of islands, with estimates ranging from somewhere around 1,200  to 6,000,    depending on the minimum size to take into account.  The number of inhabited islands is variously cited as between 166  and 227.  The largest Greek island by area is Crete, located at the southern edge of the Aegean Sea.  The second largest island is Euboea, which is separated from the mainland by the 60m-wide Euripus Strait, and is administered as part of the Central Greece region.  After the third and fourth largest Greek Islands, Lesbos and Rhodes, the rest of the islands are two-thirds of the area of Rhodes, or smaller. 

Gian Lorenzo Bernini<====>12635<====>Gian Lorenzo Bernini   Gian Lorenzo Bernini ( ; also Gianlorenzo or Giovanni Lorenzo; 7 December 1598 – 28 November 1680) was an Italian sculptor and architect.   While a major figure in the world of architecture, he was, also and even more prominently, the leading sculptor of his age, credited with creating the Baroque style of sculpture.   As one scholar has commented, "What Shakespeare is to drama, Bernini may be to sculpture: the first pan-European sculptor whose name is instantaneously identifiable with a particular manner and vision, and whose influence was inordinately powerful. . . 

German literature<====>12636<====>German literatureGerman literature comprises those literary texts written in the German language.  This includes literature written in Germany, Austria, the German parts of Belgium and Switzerland, Liechtenstein, South Tyrol in Italy and to a lesser extent works of the German diaspora.  German literature of the modern period is mostly in Standard German, but there are some currents of literature influenced to a greater or lesser degree by dialects (e. g.  Alemannic). Medieval German literature is literature written in Germany, stretching from the Carolingian dynasty; various dates have been given for the end of the German literary Middle Ages, the Reformation (1517) being the last possible cut-off point. 

Galilee<====>12639<====>Galilee Galilee ( , transliteration HaGalil);  , translit. al-Jalīl)  is a region in northern Israel. The term Galilee traditionally refers to the mountainous part, divided into Upper Galilee (  Galil Elyon) and Lower Galilee (  Galil Tahton). In the modern common usage, Galilee refers to all of the area that is beyond Mount Carmel to the northeast, extending from Dan to the north, at the base of Mount Hermon, along Mount Lebanon to the ridges of Mount Carmel and Mount Gilboa north of Jenin to the south, and from the Jordan Rift Valley to the east across the plains of the Jezreel Valley and Acre to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and the coastal plain in the west, including Beth Shean's valley, Sea of Galilee's valley, and Hula Valley, although it usually does not include Haifa's immediate northern suburbs. By this definition it overlaps with much of the administrative Northern District of the country (which also includes the Golan Heights and part of Menashe Heights but not Qiryat Tiv'on). Western Galilee (  Galil Ma'aravi) is a common term referring to the western part of the Upper Galilee and its shore, and usually also the northwestern part of the Lower Galilee, mostly overlapping with Acre sub district. Galilee Panhandle is a common term referring to the "panhandle" in the east that extends to the north, where Lebanon is to the west, and includes Hula Valley and Ramot Naftali mountains of the Upper Galilee. Historically, the part of Southern Lebanon south of the east-west section of the Litani River also belonged to the region of Galilee, but the present article mainly deals with the Israeli part of the region.EtymologyThe region's Israelite name is from the Hebrew root galil, an ultimately unique word for "district", and usually "circle". The Hebrew form used in Isaiah 8:23 (or 9:1 in different Biblical versions) is in the construct state, "g'lil hagoyim", meaning "Galilee of the Nations", i.e. the part of Galilee inhabited by Gentiles at the time that the book was written.The region in turn gave rise to the English name for the "Sea of Galilee" referred to as such in many languages including ancient Arabic. In the Hebrew language, the lake is referred to as Kinneret (Numbers 34:11, etc.), from Hebrew kinnor, "harp", describing its shape, Lake of Gennesaret (Luke 5:1, etc.), from Ginosar (Hebrew) ge, "valley", and either netser, "branch", or natsor, "to guard", "to watch" (the name which may have been a reference to Nazareth town, alternatively renamed the Sea of Tiberias (John 6:1, etc.), from the town of Tiberias at its southwestern end, named after the Greek Tiberius following the first-century CE Roman Emperor's Greek derived name. These are the three names used in originally internal Jewish-authored literature rather than the "Sea of Galilee". Room, Adrian, 2nd Ed.(2006)) "https://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&pg=PA140&lpg=PA140&dq=galilee+conquered+gauls&source=bl&ots=idxrJYKTTL&sig=PlXKpRFZRYK2RRT2W3vsMq5Baxw&hl=en&ei=85FiTZWcBIX0swODupTFCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#" p.138.  However, Jews did use "the Galilee" to refer to the whole region (Aramaic הגלילי), including its lake.GeographyMost of Galilee consists of rocky terrain, at heights of between 500 and 700 m. Several high mountains are in the region, including Mount Tabor and Mount Meron, which have relatively low temperatures and high rainfall. As a result of this climate, flora and wildlife thrive in the region, while many birds annually migrate from colder climates to Africa and back through the Hula–Jordan corridor. The streams and waterfalls, the latter mainly in Upper Galilee, along with vast fields of greenery and colourful wildflowers, as well as numerous towns of biblical importance, make the region a popular tourist destination.Due to its high rainfall  – , mild temperatures and high mountains (Mount Meron's elevation is 1,000–1,208 m), the upper Galilee region contains some distinctive flora and fauna: prickly juniper (Juniperus oxycedrus), Lebanese cedar (Cedrus libani), which grows in a small grove on Mount Meron, cyclamens, paeonias, and Rhododendron ponticum which sometimes appears on Meron.HistoryAncient and classic antiquityAccording to the Bible, Galilee was named by the Israelites and was the tribal region of Naphthali and Dan, at times overlapping the Tribe of Asher's land.    However, Dan was dispersed among the whole people rather than isolated to the lands of Dan, as the Tribe of Dan was the hereditary local law enforcement and judiciary for the whole nation.   Normally,  Galilee is just referred to as Naphthali.Chapter 9 of 1 Kings states that Solomon rewarded his Phoenician ally, King Hiram I of Sidon, with twenty cities in the land of Galilee, which would then have been either settled by foreigners during and after the reign of Hiram, or by those who had been forcibly deported there by later conquerors such as the Assyrians. Hiram, to reciprocate previous gifts given to David, accepted the upland plain among the mountains of Naphtali and renamed it "the land of Cabul" for a time.  History of Phoenicia, by George Rawlinson 1889, Phoenicia under the hegemony of Tyre (B.C. 1252-877)  In Roman times, the client kingdom of Judea was divided into Judea, Samaria, the Paralia (Palestine), and Galilee, which comprised the whole northern section of the country, and was the largest of the three regions under the Tetrarchy (Judea). After Judea became a Roman province in 6, C.E., Galilee briefly became a part of it, then separated from it for two to three centuries.The Galilee region was presumably the home of Jesus during at least 30 years of his life. Much of the first three Gospels of the New Testament give an account of Jesus' public ministry in this province, particularly in the towns of Nazareth and Capernaum. Galilee is also cited as the place where Jesus performed many public miracles, including curing a blind man. After the death of Jesus, some accounts suggest his disciples returned to Galilee and their experience of His resurrection took place there. Many of the important Tannaim, the Rabbinic sages whose views are recorded in the Mishnah and Talmud, claim to have also spent their lives there, including Honi Ha-Ma'agel, Jose the Galilean, and Ishmael the Galilean, among many others. Traditional rabbinic sources assert that the followers of the rabbis from the Galilee were widely reputed to believe their teachers (rabbis) were miracle workers, as opposed to those from Judea, Persia, and Babylon, who rarely are credited with miracles.  Many are cited for their large number of students and followers throughout the Jewish people  among the common people. The Galilee among the Jewish population was known as a wellspring of miracle workers and mystical philosophers of all types, especially just prior to the major split between Jesus' followers and those who opposed Jesus.  According to the Talmud, one of the most important founders of the modern Jewish faith, Johanan ben Zakai, was born there. Simeon bar Yochai, one of the most famed of all the Tannaim, hid from the Romans in the Galilee, and dug tunnels there to hide.  Many miracles are ascribed to him during his Galilean period after escaping Judea proper. In medieval Hebrew legend, he may have written the Zohar while there.   The archaeological discoveries of synagogues from the Hellenistic and Roman period in the Galilee show strong Phoenician influences, and a high level of tolerance for other cultures,   relative to other Jewish sacred sites from the period, the latter being "cleansed of impurities". Eastern Galilee retained a Jewish majority until at least the seventh century. Middle AgesAfter the Arab caliphate took control of the region in 638, it became part of Jund al-Urdunn (District of Jordan). Its major towns were Tiberias (which was capital of the district—Qadas), Baysan, Acre, Saffuriya, and Kabul. Le Strange, Guy. (1890) Palestine Under the Moslems pp.30-32. The Shia Fatimids conquered the region in the 10th century; a breakaway sect, venerating the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim, formed the Druze religion, centered in Mount Lebanon and partially Galilee. During the Crusades, Galilee was organized into the Principality of Galilee, one of the most important Crusader seigneuries.Ottoman eraDuring Early Ottoman era, the Galilee was governed as the Safad Sanjak, initially part of the larger administrative unit of Damascus Eyalet (1549-1660) and later as part of Sidon Eyalet (1660-1864). During the 18th century, the administrative division of Galilee was renamed to Acre Sanjak, and the Eyalet itself became centered in Acre, factually becoming the Acre Eyalet between 1775 and 1841.The Jewish population of Galilee increased significantly following their expulsion from Spain and welcome from the Ottoman Empire. The community for a time made Safed an international center of cloth weaving and manufacturing, as well as a key site for Jewish learning.    Today it remains one of Judaism's four holy cities and a center for kabbalah.In mid-17th century Galilee and Mount Lebanon became the scene of the Druze power struggle, which came in parallel with much destruction in the region and decline of major cities.In the mid-18th century, Galilee was caught up in a struggle between the Arab leader Zahir al-Umar and the Ottoman authorities who were centred in Damascus. Zahir ruled Galilee for 25 years until Ottoman loyalist Jezzar Pasha conquered the region in 1775.In 1831, the Galilee, a part of Ottoman Syria, switched hands from Ottomans to Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt until 1840. During this period, aggressive social and politic policies were introduced, which led to a violent 1834 Arab revolt. In the process of this revolt the Jewish community of Safed was greatly reduced, in the event of Safed Plunder by the rebels. The Arab rebels were subsequently defeated by the Egyptian troops, though in 1838, the Druze of Galilee led another uprising. In 1834 and 1837, major earthquakes leveled most of the towns, resulting in great loss of life. Following the 1864 Tanszimat reforms in the Ottoman Empire, the Galilee remained within Acre Sanjak, but was transferred from Sidon Eyalet to the newly formed Syria Vilayet and shortly, from 1888, became administered from Beirut Vilayet.In 1866, Galilee's first hospital, the Nazareth Hospital, was founded under the leadership of American-Armenian missionary Dr. Kaloost Vartan, assisted by German missionary John Zeller.In the early 20th century, Galilee remained part of Acre Sanjak of Ottoman Syria. It was administered as the southernmost territory of the Beirut Vilayet.British administration and Israeli ruleFollowing the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, and the Armistice of Mudros, it came under British rule, as part of the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration. Shortly after, in 1920, the region was included in the British Mandate territory, officially a part of Mandatory Palestine from 1923.After the 1948 Arab–Israeli war, nearly the whole of Galilee came under Israel's control. A large portion of the population fled or was forced to leave, leaving dozens of entire villages empty; however, a large Israeli Arab community remained based in and near the cities of Nazareth, Acre, Tamra, Sakhnin, and Shefa-'Amr, due to some extent to a successful rapprochement with the Druze. The kibbutzim around the Sea of Galilee were sometimes shelled by the Syrian army's artillery until Israel seized the Golan Heights in the 1967 Six-Day War.During the 1970s and the early 1980s, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) launched several attacks on towns and villages of the Upper and Western Galilee from Lebanon. Israel initiated Operation Litani (1979) and Operation Peace For Galilee (1982) with the stated objectives of destroying the PLO infrastructure in Lebanon and protecting the citizens of the Galilee. Israel occupied much of southern Lebanon until 1985, when it withdrew to a narrow security buffer zone.Until 2000, Hezbollah, and earlier Amal, continued to fight the Israeli Defence Forces, sometimes shelling Upper Galilee communities with Katyusha rockets. In May 2000, Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak unilaterally withdrew IDF troops from southern Lebanon, maintaining a security force on the Israeli side of the international border recognized by the United Nations. However, clashes between Hezbollah and Israel continued along the border, and UN observers condemned both for their attacks.The 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict was characterized by round-the-clock Katyusha rocket attacks (with a greatly extended range) by Hezbollah on the whole of Galilee, with long-range, ground-launched missiles hitting as far south as the Sharon Plain, Jezreel Valley, and Jordan Valley below the Sea of Galilee.Demography The largest cities in the region are Acre, Nahariya, Nazareth, Safed, Karmiel, Shaghur, Shefa-'Amr, Afula, and Tiberias.  The port city of Haifa serves as a commercial center for the whole region.Because of its hilly terrain, most of the people in the Galilee live in small villages connected by relatively few roads.  A railroad runs south from Nahariya along the Mediterranean coast, and a fork to the east is due to operate in 2015. The main sources of livelihood throughout the area are agriculture and tourism. Industrial parks are being developed, bringing further employment opportunities to the local population which includes many recent immigrants. The Israeli government is contributing funding to the private initiative, the Galilee Finance Facility, organised by the Milken Institute and Koret Economic Development Fund. The Galilee is home to a large Arab population,   comprising a Muslim majority and two smaller populations, of Druze and Arab Christians, of comparable sizes. Both Israeli Druze and Christians have their majorities in the Galilee.   Other notable minorities are the Bedouin, the Maronites and the Circassians.The north-central portion of the Galilee is also known as Central Galilee, stretching from the border with Lebanon to the northern edge of the Jezreel Valley, including the cities of Nazareth and Sakhnin, has an Arab majority of 75% with most of the Jewish population living in hilltop cities like Upper Nazareth. The northern half of the central Lower Galilee, surrounding Karmiel and Sakhnin is known as the "Heart of the Galilee". The eastern Galilee is nearly 100% Jewish. This part includes the Finger of the Galilee, the Jordan River Valley, and the shores the Sea of Galilee, and contains two of Judaism's Four Holy Cities. The southern part of the Galilee, including Jezreel Valley, and the Gilboa region are also nearly 100% Jewish, with a few small Arab villages near the West Bank border. About 80% of the population of the Western Galilee is Jewish, all the way up to the Lebanese border. Jews also form a small majority in the mountainous Upper Galilee with a significant minority Arab population (mainly Druze and Christians).The Jewish Agency has attempted to increase the Jewish population in this area,  but the non-Jewish population also has a high growth rate,  , there were 1.2 million residents in Galilee, of which 46.9% were Jewish. Currently, the Galilee is attracting significant internal migration of Haredi Jews, who are increasingly moving to the Galilee and Negev as an answer to rising housing prices in central Israel.   TourismGalilee is a popular destination for domestic and foreign tourists who enjoy its scenic, recreational, and gastronomic offerings. The Galilee attracts many Christian pilgrims, as many of the miracles of Jesus occurred, according to the New Testament, on the shores of the Sea of Galilee—including his walking on water, calming the storm, and feeding five thousand people in Tabgha. In addition, numerous sites of biblical importance are located in the Galilee, such as Megiddo, Jezreel Valley, Mount Tabor, Hazor, Horns of Hattin, and more.A popular hiking trail known as the yam leyam, or sea-to-sea, starts hikers at the Mediterranean. They then hike through the Galilee mountains, Tabor, Neria, and Meron, until their final destination, the Kinneret (Sea of Galilee).In April 2011, Israel unveiled the "Jesus Trail", a 40-mile (60-km) hiking trail in the Galilee for Christian pilgrims. The trail includes a network of footpaths, roads, and bicycle paths linking sites central to the lives of Jesus and his disciples, including Tabgha, the traditional site of Jesus' miracle of the loaves and fishes, and the Mount of Beatitudes, where he delivered his Sermon on the Mount. It ends at Capernaum on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, where Jesus espoused his teachings. Many kibbutzim and moshav families operate Zimmern (German: "rooms", the local term for a Bed and breakfasts). Numerous festivals are held throughout the year, especially in the autumn and spring holiday seasons. These include the Acre (Acco) Festival of Alternative Theater,    the olive harvest festival, music festivals featuring Anglo-American folk, klezmer, Renaissance, and chamber music, and Karmiel Dance Festival.CuisineThe cuisine of the Galilee is very diverse. The meals are lighter than in the central and southern regions. Dairy products are heavily consumed (especially the Safed cheese that originated in the mountains of the Upper Galilee). Herbs like thyme, mint, parsley, basil, and rosemary are very common with everything including dips, meat, fish, stews and cheese.In the eastern part of the Galilee, freshwater fish as much as meat (especially the tilapia that lives in the Sea of Galilee, Jordan river, and other streams in the region), fish filled with thyme and grilled with rosemary to flavor, or stuffed with oregano leaves, then topped with parsley and served with lemon to squash. This technique exists in other parts of the country including the coasts of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. A specialty of the region is a baked Tilapia flavored with celery, mint and a lot of lemon juice. Baked fish with tahini is also common in Tiberias while the coastal Galileans prefer to replace the tahini with yogurt and add sumac on top.The Galilee is famous for its olives, pomegranates, wine and especially its Labneh w'Za'atar which is served with pita bread, meat stews with wine, pomegranates and herbs such as akub, parsley, khalmit, mint, fennel, etc. are common. Galilean kubba is usually flavored with cumin, cinnamon, cardamom, concentrated pomegranate juice, onion, parsley and pine nuts and served as meze with tahini dip.Kebabs are also made almost in the same way with sumac replacing cardamom and with carob sometimes replacing the pomegranate juice.Because of its climate, beef has become more popular than lamb, although both are still eaten there.Dates are popular in the tropical climate of the Eastern Galilee - like rest of the eastern parts of the country.SubregionsThe Galilee is often divided into these subregions:Lower Galilee covers the area north of the Valleys (Jezreel, Harod and Beth Shean Valley) and south of the Beit HaKerem Valley. Its borders to the east on the Jordan Rift Valley. It contains the Arab village of Cana.Upper Galilee extends from the Beit HaKerem Valley northwards into southern Lebanon. Its eastern border is the Hula Valley and the Sea of Galilee separating it from the Golan Heights. To the west it reaches to the Coastal Plain which separates it from the Mediterranean.The Jezreel ValleyJordan ValleyValley of Beit She'anSea of Galilee and its valleyThe Hula ValleyMount GilboaWestern Galilee in its minimal definition refers to the coastal plain just west of the Upper Galilee, also known as Plain of Asher, or Plain of the Galilee, which stretches from north of Acre to Rosh HaNikra on the Israel-Lebanon border, and in the common broad definition adds the western part of Upper Galilee, and usually the northwestern part of Lower Galilee as well, corresponding more or less to Acre sub district or the Northern District.The "Galilee Panhandle" ( , Etzba HaGalil, lit. "Finger of Galilee") is a panhandle along the Hulah Valley; it contains the towns of Metulla and Qiryat Shemona, and the Dan and Banias rivers.Gallery File:Safed view 02.JPG|Safed See also  GalileanNorthern District (Israel)Sea of GalileeTourism in IsraelThe Koenig MemorandumAhuzat NaftaliReferences  Further readingAviam, M., "Galilee: The Hellenistic to Byzantine Periods," in The New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land, vol. 2 (4 vols) (Jerusalem: IES / Carta), 1993, 452–458.Meyers, Eric M.

Goths<====>12641<====>Goths   The Goths were an East Germanic people, two of whose branches, the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths, played an important role in the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the emergence of Medieval Europe.  The Goths dominated a vast area,    which at its peak under the Germanic king Ermanaric and his sub-king Athanaric possibly extended all the way from the Danube to the Don, and from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea.  The Goths spoke the Gothic language, one of the extinct East Germanic languages.  It was last spoken in Crimea in the 18 th  century by the Crimean Goths; the least-powerful, least-known, and almost paradoxically, the longest-lasting of the Gothic communities. 

Glycolysis<====>12644<====>Glycolysis Glycolysis (from glycose, an older term  for glucose + -lysis degradation) is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose C 6 H 12 O 6 , into pyruvate, CH 3 COCOO −  + H + .  The free energy released in this process is used to form the high-energy molecules ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).   Glycolysis is a determined sequence of ten enzyme-catalyzed reactions.  The intermediates provide entry points to glycolysis.  For example, most monosaccharides, such as fructose and galactose, can be converted to one of these intermediates.  The intermediates may also be directly useful.

Gdynia<====>12665<====>Gdynia Gdynia   ( ,  ) is a city in the Pomeranian Voivodeship of Poland and an important seaport of Gdańsk Bay on the south coast of the Baltic Sea.  Located in Kashubia in Eastern Pomerania, Gdynia is part of a conurbation with the spa town of Sopot, the city of Gdańsk and suburban communities, which together form a metropolitan area called the Tricity (Trójmiasto), with a population of over a million people. For centuries, Gdynia remained a small agricultural and fishing village on the Baltic coast.  At the beginning of the 20th-century Gdynia became a seaside resort town and experienced an inflow of tourists. 

Gluon<====>12666<====>Gluon  A gluon   is an elementary particle that acts as the exchange particle (or gauge boson) for the strong force between quarks.  It is analogous to the exchange of photons in the electromagnetic force between two charged particles.In layman's terms, they "glue" quarks together, forming protons and neutrons. In technical terms, gluons are vector gauge bosons that mediate strong interactions of quarks in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).  Gluons themselves carry the color charge of the strong interaction.  This is unlike the photon, which mediates the electromagnetic interaction but lacks an electric charge. 

Book of Genesis<====>12667<====>Book of Genesis  The Book of Genesis (from the Latin Vulgate, in turn borrowed or transliterated from Greek  , meaning "Origin";  , Bərēšīṯ, "In [the] beginning") is the first book of the Hebrew Bible (the Tanakh) and the Christian Old Testament.   It can be divided into two parts, the Primeval history (chapters 1-11) and the Ancestral history (chapters 12-50).   The primeval history sets out the author(s) concepts of the nature of the deity and of humankind's relationship with its maker: God creates a world which is good and fit for mankind, but when man corrupts it with sin God decides to destroy his creation, saving only the righteous Noah to reestablish the relationship between man and God. 

Galois group<====>12673<====>Galois groupIn mathematics, more specifically in the area of abstract algebra known as Galois theory, the Galois group of a certain type of field extension is a specific group associated with the field extension.  The study of field extensions and their relationship to the polynomials that give rise to them via Galois groups is called Galois theory, so named in honor of Évariste Galois who first discovered them. For a more elementary discussion of Galois groups in terms of permutation groups, see the article on Galois theory. DefinitionSuppose that E is an extension of the field F (written as E/F and read E over F). 

German Empire<====>12674<====>German Empire   The German Empire ( , officially  )    Herbert Tuttle wrote in September 1881 that the term "Reich" does not literally connote an empire as has been commonly assumed by English-speaking people.  The term " " literally denotes an empire – particularly a hereditary empire led by an emperor, although " " has been used in German to denote the Roman Empire because it had a weak hereditary tradition.  In the case of the German Empire, the official name was  , which is properly translated as "German Empire" because the official position of head of state in the constitution of the German Empire was officially a "presidency" of a confederation of German states led by the King of Prussia who would assume "the title of German Emperor" as referring to the German people, but was not emperor of Germany as in an emperor of a state. 

Gallienus<====>12677<====>Gallienus Gallienus ( ;  ;  c.  218 – 268), also known as Gallien,  was Roman Emperor with his father Valerian from 253 to 260 and alone from 260 to 268.  He ruled during the Crisis of the Third Century that nearly caused the collapse of the empire.  While he won a number of military victories, he was unable to prevent the secession of important provinces.  His 15-year reign was the longest since the 19-year rule of Caracalla. LifeRise to powerThe exact birth date of Gallienus is unknown.   The Greek chronicler John Malalas and the Epitome de Caesaribus report that he was about 50 years old at the time of his death, meaning he was born around 218. 

Gambeson<====>12679<====>Gambeson A gambeson (or aketon or padded jack or arming doublet) is a padded defensive jacket, worn as armour separately, or combined with mail or plate armour.  It also doubled as a winter coat for wearers.  Gambesons were produced with a sewing technique called quilting.  Usually constructed of linen or wool, the stuffing varied, and could be for example scrap cloth or horse hair.  During the 14th century, illustrations usually show buttons or laces up the front. An arming doublet (also called aketon) worn under armour, particularly plate armour of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Europe, contains arming points for attaching plates. 

Geography of Afghanistan<====>12681<====>Geography of Afghanistan Afghanistan is a landlocked mountainous country located within South Asia and Central Asia.   The country is the 40th largest in the world in size.  Kabul is the capital and largest city of Afghanistan, located in the Kabul Province.  Strategically located at the crossroads of major trade routes, Afghanistan has attracted a succession of invaders since the sixth century BCE.  The Hindu Kush mountains, running northeast to southwest across the country, divide it into three major regions: 1) the Central Highlands, which form part of the Himalayas  and account for roughly two thirds of the country's area; 2) the Southwestern Plateau, which accounts for one-fourth of the land; and 3) the smaller Northern Plains area, which contains the country's most fertile soil. 

Grand jury<====>12684<====>Grand jury A grand jury is a legal body empowered to conduct official proceedings and investigate potential criminal conduct, and determine whether criminal charges should be brought.  A grand jury may compel the production of documents and compel sworn testimony of witnesses to appear before it.   A grand jury is separate from the courts, which do not preside over its functioning.  The United States and Liberia are the only countries that retain grand juries,   though other common law jurisdictions formerly employed them, and most others now employ some other form of preliminary hearing.  Grand juries perform both accusatory and investigatory functions. 

Overview of gun laws by nation<====>12686<====>Overview of gun laws by nation    Gun laws and policies (collectively referred to as firearms regulation or gun control) regulate the manufacture, sale, transfer, possession, modification and use of small arms by civilians.  Many countries have restrictive firearm policies, while a few have permissive ones.  Countries with a strong gun culture may afford civilians a right to keep and bear arms, and have more-liberal gun laws than neighboring jurisdictions. Countries which regulate access to firearms will typically restrict access to certain categories of firearms and then restrict the categories of persons who may be granted a license for access to such firearms. 

Shock site<====>12688<====>Shock site    A shock site is a website that is intended to be offensive or disturbing to its viewers.  They contain material of high shock value, generally of a pornographic, scatological, graphically violent, insulting, obscenely vulgar, profane, or otherwise provocative nature.    Typically, the subject material of such sites deliberately degrades and debases a being or object.   Some shock sites display a single picture, animation, video clip or small gallery, and are circulated via email or disguised in posts to discussion sites as a prank. Steven Jones distinguishes these sites from those that collect galleries of shocking content, such as Rotten. 

Geography of Albania<====>12691<====>Geography of Albania  The Geography of Albania is defined by its location.  Albania is a small predominantly mountainous country in Southeastern Europe, on facing the Adriatic and Ionian Seas within the Mediterranean Sea.  About 20% of the country's territory consist of coastal plains, while the remaining by a mass of high rugged mountain ranges.  Albania covers a territory of  , making it the 145th largest country in the world.    It lies mostly between latitudes 42° and 39° N, and longitudes 21° and 19° E.  The country shares borders with Montenegro in the northwest, Kosovo in the northeast, Macedonia in the east and Greece in the south.

Gymnosphaerid<====>12694<====>Gymnosphaerid The gymnosphaerids (or Gymnosphaerida)    are a small group of heliozoan protists found in marine environments.   They tend to be roughly spherical with radially directed axopods, supported by microtubules in a triangular-hexagonal array arising from an amorphous central granule. GeneraThere are only three genera, each with a single species: Gymnosphaera albida, Hedraiophrys hovassei, and Actinocoryne contractilis. Gymnosphaera albida is free-living, usually benthic in shallow water.   The cells are round and naked, around 70-100 μm in diameter, and resemble the unrelated Actinosphaerium.   The outer cytoplasm, or ectoplasm, forms a distinct layer containing large vesicles. 

Group representation<====>12695<====>Group representation In the mathematical field of representation theory, group representations describe abstract groups in terms of linear transformations of vector spaces; in particular, they can be used to represent group elements as matrices so that the group operation can be represented by matrix multiplication.  Representations of groups are important because they allow many group-theoretic problems to be reduced to problems in linear algebra, which is well understood.  They are also important in physics because, for example, they describe how the symmetry group of a physical system affects the solutions of equations describing that system. The term representation of a group is also used in a more general sense to mean any "description" of a group as a group of transformations of some mathematical object. 

GRE Physics Test<====>12696<====>GRE Physics Test The GRE physics test is an examination administered by the Educational Testing Service (ETS).  The test attempts to determine the extent of the examinees' understanding of fundamental principles of physics and their ability to apply them to problem solving.  Many graduate schools require applicants to take the exam and base admission decisions in part on the results. The scope of the test is largely that of the first three years of a standardUnited States undergraduate physics curriculum, since many students who plan to continue to graduate school apply during the first half of the fourth year. 

Gardnerian Wicca<====>12697<====>Gardnerian WiccaGardnerian Wicca, or Gardnerian witchcraft, is a  tradition in the neopagan religion of Wicca, whose members can trace initiatory descent from Gerald Gardner.   The tradition is itself named after Gardner (1884–1964), a British civil servant and amateur scholar of magic.  The term "Gardnerian" was probably coined by the founder of Cochranian Witchcraft, Robert Cochrane in the 1950s or 60s, who himself left that tradition to found his own.  Gardner claimed to have learned the beliefs and practises that would later become known as Gardnerian Wicca from the New Forest coven, who allegedly initiated him into their ranks in 1939. 

Greenwich Mean Time<====>12701<====>Greenwich Mean Time Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is the mean solar time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London.  GMT was formerly used as the international civil time standard, now superseded in that function by Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  Today GMT is considered equivalent to UTC for UK civil purposes (but this is not formalised) and for navigation is considered equivalent to UT1 (the modern form of mean solar time at 0° longitude); these two meanings can differ by up to 0. 9 s.  Consequently, the term GMT should not be used for precise purposes. 

GIF<====>12702<====>GIF    The Graphics Interchange Format (better known by its acronym GIFor    ) is a bitmap image format that was developed by a team at the bulletin board service (BBS) provider CompuServe led by American computer scientist Steve Wilhite on June 15, 1987.   It has since come into widespread usage on the World Wide Web due to its wide support and portability. The format supports up to 8 bits per pixel for each image, allowing a single image to reference its own palette of up to 256 different colors chosen from the 24-bit RGB color space. 

Greg Egan<====>12706<====>Greg Egan   Greg Egan (born 20 August 1961)  is an Australian science fiction writer. LifeEgan holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics from the University of Western Australia. He published his first work in 1983.    He specialises in hard science fiction stories with mathematical and quantum ontology themes, including the nature of consciousness.  Other themes include genetics, simulated reality, posthumanism, mind uploading, sexuality, artificial intelligence, and the concept of rational naturalism being superior to religion.  He is known for his tendency to deal with complex technical material, like inventive new physics and epistemology, in an unapologetically thorough manner. 

Guy Fawkes<====>12707<====>Guy FawkesGuy Fawkes ( ; 13 April 1570 – 31 January 1606),  also known as Guido Fawkes, the name he adopted while fighting for the Spanish, was a member of a group of provincial English Catholics who planned the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605. Fawkes was born and educated in York.   His father died when Fawkes was eight years old, after which his mother married a recusant Catholic.   Fawkes converted to Catholicism and left for the continent, where he fought in the Eighty Years' War on the side of Catholic Spain against Protestant Dutch reformers  in the Low Countries. 

Goodtimes virus<====>12709<====>Goodtimes virus The Goodtimes Virus was a computer virus hoax that spread during the early years of the Internet's popularity.  Warnings about a computer virus named "Good Times" began being passed around among Internet users in 1994.  The Goodtimes virus was supposedly transmitted via an email bearing the subject header "Good Times" or "Goodtimes," hence the virus's name, and the warning recommended deleting any such email unread.   The virus described in the warnings did not exist, but the warnings themselves, were, in effect, virus-like.   In 1997 the Cult of the Dead Cow hacker collective announced that they had been responsible for the perpetration of the "Good Times" virus hoax as an exercise to "prove the gullibility of self-proclaimed "experts" on the Internet. 

Gary Snyder<====>12710<====>Gary Snyder Gary Snyder (born May 8, 1930) is an American man of letters.  Perhaps best known as a poet (often associated with the Beat Generation and the San Francisco Renaissance), he is also an essayist, lecturer, and environmental activist.  He has been described as the "poet laureate of Deep Ecology".  Petr Kopecký, "Nature Writing in American Literature: Inspirations, Interrelations, and Impacts of California Authors on the Deep Ecology Movement" The Trumpeter, Volume 22, Number 2 (2006)   "[George] Sessions' numerous references to Snyder have not passed unnoticed by other scholars.  He Is also a drunk. 

Gonzo journalism<====>12712<====>Gonzo journalism Gonzo journalism is a style of journalism that is written without claims of objectivity, often including the reporter as part of the story via a first-person narrative.  The word "gonzo" is believed to have been first used in 1970 to describe an article by Hunter S.  Thompson, who later popularized the style.  It is an energetic first-person participatory writing style in which the author is a protagonist, and it draws its power from a combination of social critique and self-satire.   It has since been applied to other subjective artistic endeavors. Gonzo journalism involves an approach to accuracy that concerns the reporting of personal experiences and emotions, in contrast to traditional journalism, which favors a detached style and relies on facts or quotations that can be verified by third parties. 

Giant panda<====>12713<====>Giant panda The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca,  literally  "black and white cat-foot";  ,  literally  "big bear cat"),    also known as panda bear or simply panda, is a bear    native to south central China.   It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.  The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the unrelated red panda.  Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo. 

Glissando<====>12716<====>Glissando  In music, a glissando   (plural: glissandi, abbreviated gliss. )  is a   from one pitch to another ( ).  It is an Italianized musical term derived from the French glisser, to glide.  In some contexts it is distinguished from the   portamento.  Some colloquial equivalents are slide, sweep (referring to the 'discrete glissando' effects on guitar & harp respectively), bend, smear, rip (for a loud, violent gliss to the beginning of a note),    lip (in jazz terminology, when executed by changing one's embouchure on a wind instrument),  plop, or falling hail (a glissando on a harp using the back of the fingernails). 

Giraffe<====>12717<====>Giraffe    The giraffe (Giraffa) is a genus of African even-toed ungulate mammals, the tallest living terrestrial animals and the largest ruminants.  The genus currently consists of one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, the type species.  Seven other species are extinct, prehistoric species known from fossils.  Taxonomic classifications of one to eight extant giraffe species have been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa, but the IUCN currently recognizes only one species with nine subspecies. The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. 

Griffith's experiment<====>12718<====>Griffith's experimentGriffith's experiment, reported in 1928 by Frederick Griffith,  was the first experiment suggesting that bacteria are capable of transferring genetic information through a process known as transformation.Griffith's findings were followed by research in the late 1930s and early 40s that isolated DNA as the material that communicated this genetic information. Pneumonia was a serious cause of death in the wake of the post-WWI Spanish influenza pandemic, and Griffith was studying the possibility of creating a vaccine.   Griffith used two strains of pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae) bacteria which infect mice – a type III-S (smooth) which was virulent, and a type II-R (rough) strain which was nonvirulent. 

Gustave de Molinari<====>12719<====>Gustave de Molinari Gustave de Molinari ( ; 3 March 1819 – 28 January 1912) was a political economist and classical liberal theorist born in Liège, in the Walloon region of Belgium, and was associated with French laissez-faire economists such as Frédéric Bastiat and Hippolyte Castille.  BiographyLiving in Paris during the 1840s, Molinari participated with the Ligue pour la Liberté des Échanges (Free Trade League), based on the theories of Frédéric Bastiat.  On his death bed in 1850, Bastiat described Molinari as the continuator of his works.  In 1849, soon after The Revolutions of 1848 in France, Molinari published two works: an essay, "The Production of Security", and a book, Les Soirées de la Rue Saint-Lazare, describing how a market in justice and protection could advantageously replace the state. 

Guerrilla warfare<====>12720<====>Guerrilla warfare   Guerrilla warfare is a form of irregular warfare in which a small group of combatants, such as paramilitary personnel, armed civilians, or irregulars, use military tactics including ambushes, sabotage, raids, petty warfare, hit-and-run tactics, and mobility to fight a larger and less-mobile traditional military. EtymologyThe term, the diminutive form of "war" in Spanish, is usually translated as "little war", and the word, guerrilla ( ), has been used to refer to the concept as early as the 18th century.  In correct Spanish usage, a person who is a member of a guerrilla unit is a guerrillero ( ) if male, or a guerrillera if female. 

Original proof of Gödel's completeness theorem<====>12727<====>Original proof of Gödel's completeness theoremThe proof of Gödel's completeness theorem given by Kurt Gödel in his doctoral dissertation of 1929 (and a rewritten version of the dissertation, published as an article in 1930) is not easy to read today; it uses concepts and formalism that are no longer used and terminology that is often obscure.  The version given below attempts to represent all the steps in the proof and all the important ideas faithfully, while restating the proof in the modern language of mathematical logic.  This outline should not be considered a rigorous proof of the theorem. 

Grits<====>12729<====>Grits  Grits are a food made from corn (maize) that is ground into a coarse meal and then boiled.  Hominy grits are a type of grits made from hominy (corn that has been treated with an alkali in a process called nixtamalization) with the germ removed.  Grits are often served with other flavorings    as a breakfast dish, usually savory.  Grits originated in the Southern United States but now are available nationwide.  Grits are popular as a dinner entrée, shrimp and grits, served primarily in the Southern United States.   Grits should not be confused with boiled ground corn, which makes "hasty pudding" or "mush" or when using coarse ground corn, which may be made into polenta, or the "mush" made from more finely ground corn meal.

George Harrison<====>12731<====>George HarrisonGeorge Harrison    (25 February 1943 – 29 November 2001) was an English guitarist, singer-songwriter, and producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles.  Often referred to as "the quiet Beatle", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work.   Although the majority of the band's songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions.  His songs for the group included "Taxman", "Within You Without You", "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", "Here Comes the Sun" and "Something", the last of which became the Beatles' second-most covered song. 

Giant planet<====>12733<====>Giant planet A giant planet is any massive planet.  They are usually primarily composed of low-boiling-point materials (gases or ices), rather than rock or other solid matter, but massive solid planets can also exist.  There are four known giant planets in the Solar System: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.  Many extrasolar giant planets have been identified orbiting other stars. Giant planets are also sometimes called jovian planets, after Jupiter.  They are also sometimes known as gas giants.  However, many astronomers apply the latter term only to Jupiter and Saturn, classifying Uranus and Neptune, which have different compositions, as ice giants. 

Goddess<====>12734<====>Goddess  A goddess is a female deity.   Goddesses have been linked with virtues such as beauty, love, motherhood and fertility (Mother-goddess cult in prehistoric times).   They have also been associated with ideas such as  war, creation, and death. In some faiths, a sacred female figure holds a central place in religious prayer and worship.  For example, Shaktism, the worship of the female force that animates the world, is one of the three major sects of Hinduism.  In Tibetan Buddhism, the highest advancement any person can achieve is to become like the great female Buddhas (e.

Gunpowder<====>12737<====>Gunpowder   Gunpowder, also known as black powder to distinguish it from modern smokeless powder, is the earliest known chemical explosive.  It consists of a mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate (saltpeter).  The sulfur and charcoal act as fuels while the saltpeter is an oxidizer.    Because of its incendiary properties and the amount of heat and gas volume that it generates, gunpowder has been widely used as a propellant in firearms, artillery, rockets, and fireworks and as a blasting powder in quarrying, mining, and road building. Gunpowder was invented in 9th-century China and spread throughout most parts of Eurasia by the end of the 13th century. 

Gary Kildall<====>12740<====>Gary Kildall Gary Arlen Kildall ( ; May 19, 1942 – July 11, 1994) was an American computer scientist and microcomputer entrepreneur who created the CP/M operating system and founded Digital Research, Inc.  (DRI).  Kildall was one of the first people to see microprocessors as fully capable computers rather than equipment controllers and to organize a company around this concept.    He also co-hosted the PBS TV show The Computer Chronicles.  Although his career in computing spanned more than two decades, he is mainly remembered in connection with IBM's unsuccessful attempt in 1980 to license CP/M for the IBM PC. 

Gesta Danorum<====>12741<====>Gesta Danorum  Gesta Danorum ("Deeds of the Danes") is a patriotic work of Danish history, by the 13th century author Saxo Grammaticus ("Saxo the Literate", literally "the Grammarian").  It is the most ambitious literary undertaking of medieval Denmark and is an essential source for the nation's early history.  It is also one of the oldest known written documents about the history of Estonia and Latvia. Consisting of sixteen books written in Latin on the invitation of Archbishop Absalon, Gesta Danorum describes Danish history and to some degree Scandinavian history in general, from prehistory to the late 12th century. 

Garrison Keillor<====>12743<====>Garrison Keillor  Gary Edward "Garrison" Keillor (born August 7, 1942) is an American author, storyteller, humorist, voice actor, and radio personality.  He is best known as the creator of the Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) show A Prairie Home Companion (called Garrison Keillor's Radio Show in some international syndication), which he hosted from 1974 to 2016.  Keillor created the fictional Minnesota town Lake Wobegon, the setting of many of his books, including Lake Wobegon Days and Leaving Home: A Collection of Lake Wobegon Stories.  Other creations include Guy Noir, a detective voiced by Keillor who appeared in A Prairie Home Companion comic skits. 

Galatia<====>12744<====>Galatia  Ancient Galatia ( ;  ) was an area in the highlands of central Anatolia (Ankara, Çorum, Yozgat Province) in modern Turkey.  Galatia was named for the immigrant Gauls from Thrace (cf.  Tylis), who settled here and became its ruling caste in the 3rd century BC, following the Gallic invasion of the Balkans in 279 BC.  It has been called the "Gallia" of the East, Roman writers calling its inhabitants Galli (Gauls or Celts). GeographyGalatia was bounded on the north by Bithynia and Paphlagonia, on the east by Pontus and Cappadocia, on the south by Cilicia and Lycaonia, and on the west by Phrygia. 

Generalization<====>12746<====>Generalization    A generalization (or generalisation) is the formulation of general concepts from specific instances by abstracting common properties.  Generalizations posit the existence of a domain or set of elements, as well as one or more common characteristics shared by those elements (thus creating a conceptual model).  As such, they are the essential basis of all valid deductive inferences.  The process of verification is necessary to determine whether a generalization holds true for any given situation. Generalization is the process of identifying the parts of a whole, as belonging to the whole.  The parts, completely unrelated may be brought together as a group, belonging to the whole by establishing a common relation between them. 

Gia Carangi<====>12747<====>Gia Carangi Gia Marie Carangi (January 29, 1960 – November 18, 1986) was an American fashion model during the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Considered by some to be the first supermodel,  she was featured on the cover of fashion magazines, including multiple editions of Vogue and Cosmopolitan, and appeared in advertising campaigns for such fashion houses as Armani, Chanel, Christian Dior, Versace, and Yves Saint Laurent.    After she became addicted to heroin, Carangi's modeling career rapidly declined.  She died of AIDS-related complications at the age of 26, becoming one of the first famous women to die of the disease. 

Giacomo Puccini<====>12750<====>Giacomo Puccini   Giacomo Antonio Domenico Michele Secondo Maria Puccini ( ; 22 December 1858  29 November 1924) was an Italian opera composer who has been called "the greatest composer of Italian opera after Verdi".  Puccini's early work was rooted in traditional late-19th-century romantic Italian opera.  Later, he successfully developed his work in the realistic verismo style, of which he became one of the leading exponents. Puccini's most renowned works are La bohème (1896), Tosca (1900), Madama Butterfly (1904), and Turandot (1924), all of which are among the important operas played as standards.  Family and educationPuccini was born Giacomo Antonio Domenico Michele Secondo Maria Puccini in Lucca, Italy in 1858. 

George Cukor<====>12754<====>George Cukor George Dewey Cukor ( ;  July 7, 1899 – January 24, 1983) was an American film director.   He mainly concentrated on comedies and literary adaptations.  His career flourished at RKO when David O.  Selznick, the studio's Head of Production, assigned Cukor to direct several of RKO's major films, including What Price Hollywood? (1932), A Bill of Divorcement (1932), Our Betters (1933), and Little Women (1933).  When Selznick moved to MGM in 1933, Cukor followed and directed Dinner at Eight (1933) and David Copperfield (1935) for Selznick and Romeo and Juliet (1936) and Camille (1936) for Irving Thalberg. 

Gas mask<====>12772<====>Gas mask The gas mask is a mask used to protect the user from inhaling airborne pollutants and toxic gases.   The mask forms a sealed cover over the nose and mouth, but may also cover the eyes and other vulnerable soft tissues of the face.  Some gas masks are also respirators, though the word gas mask is often used to refer to military equipment (e. g.  field protective mask).  The user of the gas mask is not protected from gas that the skin can absorb.  Most gas mask filters will last around 24 hours in a nuclear biological chemical (NBC) situation. 

George Frideric Handel<====>12775<====>George Frideric Handel    George Frideric (or Frederick) Handel ( ;  born ; 23 February 1685 (O. S. ) [(N. S. ) 5 March] – 14 April 1759)   was a German, later British, baroque composer who spent the bulk of his career in London, becoming well known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, and organ concertos.  Handel received important training in Halle and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712; he became a naturalised British subject in 1727.   He was strongly influenced both by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition. 

Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina<====>12776<====>Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (  1525 – 2 February 1594)  was an Italian Renaissance composer of sacred music and the best-known 16th-century representative of the Roman School of musical composition.  Jerome Roche, Palestrina (Oxford Studies of Composers, 7; New York: Oxford University Press, 1971),  .   He had a lasting influence on the development of church music, and his work has often been seen as the culmination of Renaissance polyphony.  BiographyPalestrina was born in the town of Palestrina, near Rome, then part of the Papal States.  Documents suggest that he first visited Rome in 1537, when he is listed as a chorister at the Santa Maria Maggiore basilica. 

Group velocity<====>12778<====>Group velocityThe group velocity of a wave is the velocity with which the overall shape of the waves' amplitudes—known as the modulation or envelope of the wave—propagates through space. For example, if a stone is thrown into the middle of a very still pond, a circular pattern of waves with a quiescent center appears in the water, also known as a Capillary wave.  The expanding ring of waves is the wave group, within which one can discern individual wavelets of differing wavelengths traveling at different speeds.  The shorter waves travel faster than the group as a whole, but their amplitudes diminish as they approach the leading edge. 

Glitnir<====>12780<====>Glitnir Glitnir (glit, nitor, splendor, OHG. kliz, E. shining) is the hall of Forseti, the Norse god of law and justice, and the seat of justice amongst gods and men. It is also noted to have been a place of dwelling for Balder, Forseti's father in Norse and Germanic mythologies. Glitnir is symbolic of the importance of discussion rather than violence as a means of resolution of conflict within the Norse tradition. It has pillars of gold and is roofed with silver.

Group action<====>12781<====>Group action  In mathematics, an action of a group is a formal way of interpreting the manner in which the elements of the group correspond to transformations of some space in a way that preserves the structure of that space.  Common examples of spaces that groups act on are sets, vector spaces, and topological spaces.  Actions of groups on vector spaces are called representations of the group. When there is a natural correspondence between the set of group elements and the set of space transformations, a group can be interpreted as acting on the space in a canonical way. 

Gzip<====>12783<====>Gzip   gzip is a file format and a software application used for file compression and decompression.  The program was created by Jean-loup Gailly  and Mark Adler as a free software replacement for the compress program used in early Unix systems, and intended for use by GNU (the "g" is from "GNU").  Version 0. 1 was first publicly released on 31 October 1992, and version 1. 0 followed in February 1993. File format gzip is based on the DEFLATE algorithm, which is a combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding.  DEFLATE was intended as a replacement for LZW and other patent-encumbered data compression algorithms which, at the time, limited the usability of compress and other popular archivers. 

General anaesthetic<====>12786<====>General anaesthetic A general anaesthetic (or anesthetic, see spelling differences) is a drug that can bring about a reversible loss of consciousness.  Anaesthetists, physician assistants or nurse anaesthetists administer these drugs to induce or maintain general anaesthesia to facilitate surgery.  Some of these drugs are also used in lower dosages for pain management.  The biological mechanisms of the action of general anaesthetics are not well understood. Mode of administrationDrugs given to induce general anaesthesia can be either as gases or vapours (inhalational anaesthetics), or as injections (intravenous anaesthetics or even intramuscular).   It is possible to deliver anaesthesia solely by inhalation or injection, but most commonly the two forms are combined, with an injection given to induce anaesthesia and a gas used to maintain it. 

Geoffrey Chaucer<====>12787<====>Geoffrey Chaucer    Geoffrey Chaucer ( ; c.  1343 – 25 October 1400), known as the Father of English literature,  is widely considered the greatest English poet of the Middle Ages.  He was the first poet to be buried in Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey. While he achieved fame during his lifetime as an author, philosopher, and astronomer, composing a scientific treatise on the astrolabe for his ten-year-old son Lewis, Chaucer also maintained an active career in the civil service as a bureaucrat, courtier and diplomat.  Among his many works are The Book of the Duchess, The House of Fame, The Legend of Good Women and Troilus and Criseyde. 

Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)<====>12789<====>Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)Gerald Brosseau Gardner (1884–1964), also known by the craft name Scire, was an English Wiccan, as well as an author and an amateur anthropologist and archaeologist.  He was instrumental in bringing the Contemporary Pagan religion of Wicca to public attention, writing some of its definitive religious texts and founding the tradition of Gardnerian Wicca. Born into an upper-middle-class family in Blundellsands, Lancashire, Gardner spent much of his childhood abroad in Madeira.  In 1900, he moved to colonial Ceylon, and then in 1911 to Malaya, where he worked as a civil servant, independently developing an interest in the native peoples and writing papers and a book about their magical practices. 

Gavin MacLeod<====>12792<====>Gavin MacLeod   Gavin MacLeod (born Allan George See; February 28, 1931) is an American film and television character actor, ship's ambassador, Christian activist and author, whose career spans six decades of television.  He has also appeared as a guest on several talk, variety and religious shows.  MacLeod's long career began in films in 1957, playing opposite Peter Mann in The Sword of Ali Baba (1965), Anthony Franciosa in A Man Called Gannon (1968), Christopher George in The Thousand Plane Raid, and Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas along with Carroll O'Connor in Kelly's Heroes (1970).  He then achieved continuing television success co-starring opposite Ernest Borgnine on McHale's Navy (1962–1964), as Joseph "Happy" Haines, and on The Mary Tyler Moore Show (1970–1977) as Murray Slaughter. 

Gopher (protocol)<====>12794<====>Gopher (protocol)  The Gopher protocol   is a TCP/IP application layer protocol designed for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents over the Internet.  The Gopher protocol was strongly oriented towards a menu-document design and presented an alternative to the World Wide Web in its early stages, but ultimately Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) became the dominant protocol.  The Gopher ecosystem is often regarded as the effective predecessor of the World Wide Web.  The protocol was invented by a team led by Mark P.  McCahill    at the University of Minnesota.   It offers some features not natively supported by the Web and imposes a much stronger hierarchy on information stored on it. 

General election<====>12795<====>General election A general election is an election in which all or most members of a given political body are chosen.  These are usually held for a nation's primary legislative body, as distinguished from by-elections and local elections. In presidential systems, a general election is a regularly scheduled election where both the president, and either "a class" of or all members of the national legislature are elected at the same time but can also involve special elections held to fill prematurely vacated positions.  A general election day may also include elections for local officials. The term originates in the elections in the United Kingdom for the House of Commons. 

Genotype<====>12796<====>Genotype   The genotype – a term coined by Danish botanist, plant physiologist and geneticist Wilhelm Johannsen in 1903  – is the part (DNA sequence) of the genetic makeup of a cell, and therefore of an organism or  individual, which determines a specific characteristic (phenotype) of that cell/organism/individual.   Genotype is one of three factors that determine phenotype, the other two being inherited epigenetic factors, and non-inherited environmental factors.  DNA mutations which are acquired rather than inherited, such as cancer mutations, are not part of the individual's genotype; hence, scientists and physicians sometimes talk for example about the (geno)type of a particular cancer, that is the genotype of the disease as distinct from the diseased. 

Gerard Hengeveld<====>12797<====>Gerard Hengeveld Gerard Hengeveld (7 December 1910, Kampen - October 28, 2001, Bergen, North Holland) was a Dutch classical pianist, music composer and educationalist.  He is especially known for his compositions of study material for piano.  Other compositions include two piano concertos, a violin sonata, and a sonata for cello.  Hengeveld was an able interpreter and performer of the music of Bach for piano and harpsichord.  He gave regular concerts in the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam.  Some of his concerts were captured on record.  Hengeveld was a professor at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague.

Graphic design<====>12799<====>Graphic designGraphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving using one or more of typography, photography and illustration.  The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term "graphic design" is used synonymously.  Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages.  They use typography, visual arts and page layout techniques to create visual compositions.  Common uses of graphic design include corporate design (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), wayfinding or environmental design, advertising, web design, communication design, product packaging and signage. 

Great Rift Valley<====>12800<====>Great Rift Valley  The Great Rift Valley is a name given to the continuous geographic trench, approximately   in length, that runs from Lebanon's Beqaa Valley in Asia to Mozambique in Southeastern Africa.The name continues in some usages, although it is today considered geologically imprecise as it combines features that are today regarded as separate, although related, rift and fault systems. Today, the term is most often used to refer to the valley of the East African Rift, the divergent plate boundary which extends from the Afar Triple Junction southward across eastern Africa, and is in the process of splitting the African Plate into two new separate plates. 

Grigori Rasputin<====>12804<====>Grigori Rasputin   Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin (   ) (  –  ) was a Russian mystic and self-proclaimed holy man who befriended the family of Tsar Nicholas II and gained considerable influence in late imperial Russia. Born to a peasant family in the Siberian village  of Pokrovskoye, Rasputin had a religious conversion experience after taking a pilgrimage to a monastery in 1897.  He has been described as a monk or as a "strannik" (wanderer, or pilgrim), though he held no official position in the Russian Orthodox Church.  After traveling to St. 

Gemstone<====>12806<====>Gemstone   A gemstone (also called a gem, fine gem, jewel, precious stone, or semi-precious stone) is a piece of mineral crystal which, in cut and polished form, is used to make jewelry or other adornments.    However, certain rocks (such as lapis lazuli, opal, and jade) or organic materials that are not minerals (such as amber, jet, and pearl) are also used for jewelry and are therefore often considered to be gemstones as well.  Most gemstones are hard, but some soft minerals are used in jewelry because of their luster or other physical properties that have aesthetic value. 

Gerard David<====>12807<====>Gerard David   Gerard David (c.  1460 – 13 August 1523) was an Early Netherlandish painter and manuscript illuminator known for his brilliant use of color.  Only a bare outline of his life survives, although some facts are known.  He may have been the Meester gheraet van brugghe who became a master of the Antwerp guild in 1515.  He was very successful in his lifetime and probably ran two workshops, in Antwerp and Bruges.  Campbell, 116  Like many painters of his period, his reputation diminished in the 17th century until he was rediscovered in the 19th century. 

GSM<====>12808<====>GSM   GSM  (Global System for Mobile Communications, originally Groupe Spécial Mobile) is a standard developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to describe the protocols for second-generation digital cellular networks used by mobile devices such as tablets, first deployed in Finland in December 1991.    , it has become the global standard for mobile communications – with over 90% market share, operating in over 193 countries and territories.  2G networks developed as a replacement for first generation (1G) analog cellular networks, and the GSM standard originally described as a digital, circuit-switched network optimized for full duplex voice telephony.

Gustav Radbruch<====>12816<====>Gustav Radbruch  Gustav Radbruch (21 November 1878 – 23 November 1949) was a German legal scholar and politician.  He served as Minister of Justice of Germany during the early Weimar period.  Radbruch is also regarded as one of the most influential legal philosophers of the 20th century. LifeBorn in Lübeck, Radbruch studied law in Munich, Leipzig and Berlin.  He passed his first bar exam ("Staatsexamen") in Berlin in 1901, and the following year he received his doctorate with a dissertation on "The Theory of adequate causation. " This was followed in 1903 by his qualification to teach criminal law in Heidelberg. 

Gate<====>12821<====>Gate A gate or gateway is a point of entry to a space which is enclosed by walls.  Gates may prevent or control the entry or exit of individuals, or they may be merely decorative.  Other terms for gate include yett and port.   The word derives from the old Norse "gata", meaning road or  , and originally referred to the gap in the wall or fence, rather than the barrier which closed it.  The moving part or parts of a gateway may be called "doors", but used for the whole point of entry door usually refers to the entry to a building, or an internal opening between different rooms. 

Greek fire<====>12822<====>Greek fire Greek fire was an incendiary weapon used by the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire that was first developed  .  The Byzantines typically used it in naval battles to great effect, as it could continue burning while floating on water.  It provided a technological advantage and was responsible for many key Byzantine military victories, most notably the salvation of Constantinople from two Arab sieges, thus securing the Empire's survival. The impression made by Greek fire on the western European Crusaders was such that the name was applied to any sort of incendiary weapon, including those used by Arabs, the Chinese, and the Mongols. 

Garbage in, garbage out<====>12823<====>Garbage in, garbage outIn computer science, garbage in, garbage out (GIGO) is where flawed, or nonsense input data produces nonsense output or "garbage".  The principle also applies more generally to all analysis and logic, in that arguments are unsound if their premises are flawed. HistoryIt was popular in the early days of computing, but applies even more today, when powerful computers can produce large amounts of erroneous data or information in a short time.  The first use of the term has been dated to a November 10, 1957, syndicated newspaper article about US Army mathematicians and their work with early computers,    in which an Army Specialist named William D.

General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade<====>12831<====>General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade   General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  was a legal agreement between many countries, whose overall purpose was to promote international trade by reducing or eliminating trade barriers such as tariffs or quotas.  According to its preamble, its purpose was the "substantial reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers and the elimination of preferences, on a reciprocal and mutually advantageous basis. " It was first discussed during the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment and was the outcome of the failure of negotiating governments to create the International Trade Organization (ITO). 

G protein–coupled receptor<====>12832<====>G protein–coupled receptor  G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) which are also known as seven-(pass)-transmembrane domain receptors, 7TM receptors, heptahelical receptors, serpentine receptor, and G protein–linked receptors (GPLR), constitute a large protein family of receptors that detect molecules outside the cell and activate internal signal transduction pathways and, ultimately, cellular responses.  Coupling with G proteins, they are called seven-transmembrane receptors because they pass through the cell membrane seven times.    G protein–coupled receptors are found only in eukaryotes, including yeast, choanoflagellates,    and animals.  The ligands that bind and activate these receptors include light-sensitive compounds, odors, pheromones, hormones, and neurotransmitters, and vary in size from small molecules to peptides to large proteins. 

GTPase<====>12833<====>GTPaseGTPases (singular GTPase) are a large family of hydrolase enzymes that can bind and hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP).The GTP binding and hydrolysis takes place in the highly conserved G domain common to all GTPases. FunctionsGTPases play an important role in: Signal transduction at the intracellular domain of transmembrane receptors, including recognition of taste, smell and light.  Protein biosynthesis (a. k. a.  translation) at the ribosome.  Control and differentiation during cell division.  Translocation of proteins through membranes.  Transport of vesicles within the cell.  (GTPases control assembly of vesicle coats. )MechanismThe hydrolysis of the γ phosphate of GTP into guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and P i , inorganic phosphate, occurs by the S N 2 mechanism (see nucleophilic substitution) via a pentavalent intermediate state and is dependent on the magnesium ion Mg 2+ .

G protein<====>12841<====>G protein G proteins, also known as guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, are a family of proteins that act as molecular switches inside cells, and are involved in transmitting signals from a variety of stimuli outside a cell to its interior.   Their activity is regulated by factors that control their ability to bind to and hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to guanosine diphosphate (GDP).  When they are bound to GTP, they are 'on', and, when they are bound to GDP, they are 'off'.  G proteins belong to the larger group of enzymes called GTPases. There are two classes of G proteins. 

Gary Gygax<====>12848<====>Gary Gygax   Ernest Gary Gygax (   ) (July 27, 1938 – March 4, 2008)    was an American game designer and author best known for co-creating the pioneering role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) with Dave Arneson. In the 1960s, Gygax created an organization of wargaming clubs and founded the Gen Con gaming convention.  In 1971, he helped develop Chainmail, a miniatures wargame based on medieval warfare.  He co-founded the company Tactical Studies Rules (TSR, Inc. ) with childhood friend Don Kaye in 1973.  The following year, he and Arneson created D&D, which expanded on Gygax's Chainmail and included elements of the fantasy stories he loved as a child. 

Governor of New South Wales<====>12850<====>Governor of New South Wales  The Governor of New South Wales is the viceregal representative of the Australian monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, in the state of New South Wales.  In an analogous way to the Governor-General of Australia at the national level, the Governors of the Australian states perform constitutional and ceremonial functions at the state level.  The Governor is appointed by the queen on the advice of the Premier of New South Wales,    for an unfixed period of time—known as serving At Her Majesty's pleasure—though five years is the norm.  The current Governor is retired General David Hurley, who succeeded Dame Marie Bashir on 2 October 2014.

He wrote more than sixty plays, including major works such as Man and Superman (1902), Pygmalion (1912) and Saint Joan (1923).  With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory, Shaw became the leading dramatist of his generation, and in 1925 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. 

Galvanization<====>12858<====>Galvanization   Galvanization (or galvanizing as it is most commonly called in that industry) is the process of applying a protective zinc coating to steel or iron, to prevent rusting.  The most common method is hot-dip galvanizing, in which parts are submerged in a bath of molten zinc.  Protective actionGalvanising protects the underlying iron or steel in the following main ways:The zinc coating, when intact, prevents corrosive substances from reaching the underlying steel or iron. The zinc serves as a sacrificial anode so that even if the coating is scratched, the exposed steel will still be protected by the remaining zinc. 

Golden Rule<====>12859<====>Golden Rule   The Golden Rule (which can be considered a law of reciprocity in some religions) is the principle of treating others as one would wish to be treated.  It is a maxim of altruism that is found in many religions and cultures.    This dictionary of philosophy contains the following exact quote under the entry for "golden rule": "The maxim 'Treat others how you wish to be treated'. Various expressions of the rule exist in the tenets of most religions and creeds through the ages, testifying to its universal applicability. " (end quote).   The maxim may appear as either a positive or negative injunction governing conduct:One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself (positive or directive form).

George Abbot (author)<====>12863<====>George Abbot (author) George Abbot or Abbott (1604 — 2 February 1649) was an English lay writer, known as "The Puritan", and a politician who sat in the House of Commons in two periods between 1640 and 1649.  He died on "Feb.  1648-9" see Dictionary of National Biography, Errata (1904), p.  1 in  .  This means he died 3 days after the execution of Charles I, which is usually recorded as having happened on 30 January 1649 not 1648 because at that time the new year was 25 March not 1 January (for a more detailed explanation see Old Style and New Style dates). 

Globular cluster<====>12866<====>Globular clusterA globular cluster is a spherical collection of stars that orbits a galactic core  as a satellite.  Globular clusters are very tightly bound by gravity, which gives them their spherical shapes and relatively high stellar densities toward their centers.  The name of this category of star cluster is derived from the Latin globulus—a small sphere.  A globular cluster is sometimes known more simply as a globular. Globular clusters are found in the halo of a galaxy and contain considerably more stars and are much older than the less dense open clusters, which are found in the disk of a galaxy. 

George Vancouver<====>12867<====>George Vancouver  Captain George Vancouver (22 June 1757 – 10 May 1798) was a British officer of the Royal Navy, best known for his 1791–95 expedition, which explored and charted North America's northwestern Pacific Coast regions, including the coasts of contemporary Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon.  He also explored the Hawaiian Islands and the southwest coast of Australia. In Canada, Vancouver Island and the city of  Vancouver are named after him, as are Vancouver, Washington, in the United States, Mount Vancouver on the Yukon/Alaska border, and New Zealand's sixth highest mountain.

Great Vowel Shift<====>12872<====>Great Vowel Shift  The Great Vowel Shift was a major series of changes in the pronunciation of the English language that took place, beginning in southern England, primarily between 1350 and the 1600s and 1700s,   today influencing effectively all dialects of English. Through this vowel shift, all Middle English long vowels changed their pronunciation.  English spelling was first becoming standardized in the 15th and 16th centuries, and the Great Vowel Shift is responsible for the fact that English spellings now often strongly deviate in their representation of English pronunciations.   The Great Vowel Shift was first studied by Otto Jespersen (1860–1943), a Danish linguist and Anglicist, who coined the term.

Gini coefficient<====>12883<====>Gini coefficient  In economics, the Gini coefficient (sometimes expressed as a Gini ratio or a normalized Gini index) (   ) is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income or wealth distribution of a nation's residents, and is the most commonly used measure of inequality.  It was developed by the Italian statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini and published in his 1912 paper Variability and Mutability ( ).   The Gini coefficient measures the inequality among values of a frequency distribution (for example, levels of income).  A Gini coefficient of zero expresses perfect equality, where all values are the same (for example, where everyone has the same income). 

Government Communications Headquarters<====>12884<====>Government Communications HeadquartersThe Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) is an intelligence and security organisation responsible for providing signals intelligence (SIGINT) and information assurance to the government and armed forces of the United Kingdom.   Based in "The Doughnut" in the suburbs of Cheltenham, GCHQ is the responsibility of the country's Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, but it is not a part of the Foreign Office and its director ranks as a Permanent Secretary. GCHQ was originally established after the First World War as the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) and was known under that name until 1946. 

Francis Gary Powers<====>12888<====>Francis Gary Powers   Francis Gary Powers (August 17, 1929 – August 1, 1977) – often referred to as simply Gary Powers – was an American pilot whose Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)  U-2 spy plane was shot down while flying a reconnaissance mission in Soviet Union airspace, causing the 1960 U-2 incident. Early lifePowers was born August 17, 1929, in Jenkins, Kentucky, the son of Oliver Winfield Powers (1904–1970), a coal miner, and his wife Ida Melinda Powers ( ; 1905–1991).    His family eventually moved to Pound, Virginia, just across the state border.  He was the second born and only male of six children. 

Gospel of James<====>12890<====>Gospel of James   The Gospel of James, also known as the Infancy Gospel of James or the Protoevangelium of James, is an apocryphal Gospel probably written about AD 145, which expands backward in time the infancy stories contained in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, and presents a narrative concerning the birth and upbringing of Mary herself.  It is the oldest source outside the New Testament to assert the virginity of Mary not only prior to, but during (and after) the birth of Jesus.   The ancient manuscripts that preserve the book have different titles, including "The Birth of Mary", "The Story of the Birth of Saint Mary, Mother of God," and "The Birth of Mary; The Revelation of James. 

Gene therapy<====>12891<====>Gene therapy Gene therapy is the therapeutic delivery of nucleic acid into a patient's cells as a drug to treat disease.    The first attempt at modifying human DNA was performed in 1980 by Martin Cline, but the first successful nuclear gene transfer in humans, approved by the National Institutes of Health, was performed in May 1989.   The first therapeutic use of gene transfer as well as the first direct insertion of human DNA into the nuclear genome was performed by French Anderson in a trial starting in September 1990. Between 1989 and February 2016, over 2,300 clinical trials had been conducted, more than half of them in phase I. 

Gulf of Oman<====>12896<====>Gulf of Oman  The Gulf of Oman or Sea of Oman (  khalīj ʿUmān;  ) is a strait (and not an actual gulf) that connects the Arabian Sea with the Strait of Hormuz, which then runs to the Persian Gulf.  It borders Iran (in broader definition also Pakistan) on the north, Oman on the south, and the United Arab Emirates on the west. ExtentThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Gulf of Oman as follows:  Bordering countriesIranOmanUnited Arab EmiratesPakistanEcology Gulf of Oman desert and semi-desertReferences Further reading"The Book of Duarte Barbosa" by Duarte Barbosa, Mansel Longworth Dames. 

Grammatical case<====>12898<====>Grammatical case Case is a special grammatical category of a noun, pronoun, adjective, participle or numeral whose value reflects the grammatical function performed by that word in a phrase, clause, or sentence.  In some languages, nouns, pronouns, adjectives, determiners, participles, prepositions, numerals, articles and their modifiers take different inflected forms depending on what case they are in.  As a language evolves, cases can merge (for instance, in Ancient Greek, the locative case merged with the dative), a phenomenon formally called syncretism.  English has largely lost its case system, although personal pronouns still have three cases that are simplified forms of the nominative, accusative and genitive cases that are used with personal pronouns: subjective case (I, you, he, she, it, we, they, who, whoever), objective case (me, you, him, her, it, us, them, whom, whomever) and possessive case (my, mine; your, yours; his; her, hers; its; our, ours; their, theirs; whose; whosever ). 

Gestapo<====>12899<====>GestapoThe Gestapo ( ), abbreviation of Geheime Staatspolizei (Secret State Police),   was the official secret police of Nazi Germany and German-occupied Europe. The force was created by Hermann Göring in 1933 by combining the various security police agencies of Prussia into one organization.  Beginning on 20 April 1934 it passed to the administration of Schutzstaffel (SS) national leader Heinrich Himmler, who in 1936 was appointed Chief of German Police (Chef der Deutschen Polizei) by Hitler.  The Gestapo at this time becoming a national rather than a Prussian state agency as a suboffice of the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo) (Security Police). 

Grammatical conjugation<====>12900<====>Grammatical conjugation In linguistics, conjugation (   ) is the creation of derived forms of a verb from its principal parts by inflection (alteration of form according to rules of grammar).  Conjugation may be affected by person, number, gender, tense, aspect, mood, voice, case, and other grammatical categories such as possession, definiteness, politeness, causativity, clusivity, interrogativity, transitivity, valency, polarity, telicity,  volition, mirativity, evidentiality, animacy, associativity,  pluractionality, reciprocity, agreement, polypersonal agreement, incorporation, noun class, noun classifiers, and verb classifiers  in some languages.  Agglutinative and polysynthetic languages tend to have the most complex conjugations albeit some fusional languages such as Archi can also have extremely complex conjugation. 

Gomoku<====>12902<====>GomokuGomoku, also called Gobang or Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game.  It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board, using 15×15 of the 19×19 grid intersections.   Because pieces are not moved or removed from the board, Gomoku may also be played as a paper and pencil game.  The game is known in several countries under different names. Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection.  The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

Gegenschein<====>12903<====>GegenscheinGegenschein (  German for "countershine") is a faint brightening of the night sky in the region of the antisolar point. ExplanationLike the zodiacal light, the gegenschein is sunlight scattered by interplanetary dust.  Most of this dust is orbiting the Sun in about the ecliptic plane, with a possible concentration of particles at the   Earth–Sun Lagrangian point.  It is distinguished from zodiacal light by its high angle of reflection of the incident sunlight on the dust particles.  It forms a slightly more luminous, oval glow directly opposite the Sun within the band of luminous zodiacal light. 

Glyph<====>12904<====>Glyph   In typography, a glyph   is an elemental symbol within an agreed set of symbols, intended to represent a readable character  for the purposes of writing.  Glyphs are considered to be unique marks that collectively add up to the spelling of a word or contribute to a specific meaning of what is written, with that meaning dependent on cultural and social usage.   In contrast, in most languages written in any variety of the Latin alphabet, the dot on a lower-case i is not a glyph because it does not convey any distinction, and an i in which the dot has been accidentally omitted is still likely to be recognized correctly. 

Goth subculture<====>12905<====>Goth subculture   The goth subculture adopts dark fashion elements such as black clothing, dyed black hair, dark eyeliner, black fingernails, and black period-styled clothing Eric Lipton Disturbed Shooters Weren't True Goth from the Chicago Tribune, 27 April 1999  and a focus on gothic rock and a range of other music genres.  The goth subculture began in England during the early-1980s where it was developed from the gothic rock scene, itself an offshoot of the post-punk genre.  Notable post-punk groups that presaged that genre include Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division and Bauhaus.  The goth subculture has survived much longer than others of the same era, and has continued to diversify and spread throughout the world. 

Global warming potential<====>12908<====>Global warming potentialGlobal warming potential (GWP) is a relative measure of how much heat a greenhouse gas traps in the atmosphere.  It compares the amount of heat trapped by a certain mass of the gas in question to the amount of heat trapped by a similar mass of carbon dioxide.  A GWP is calculated over a specific time interval, commonly 20, 100, or 500 years.  GWP is expressed as a factor of carbon dioxide (whose GWP is standardized to 1).  In the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, methane has a lifetime of 12. 

Grothendieck topology<====>12910<====>Grothendieck topologyIn category theory, a branch of mathematics, a Grothendieck topology is a structure on a category C which makes the objects of C act like the open sets of a topological space.   A category together with a choice of Grothendieck topology is called a site. Grothendieck topologies axiomatize the notion of an open cover.   Using the notion of covering provided by a Grothendieck topology, it becomes possible to define sheaves on a category and their cohomology.   This was first done in algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory by Alexander Grothendieck to define the étale cohomology of a scheme. 

Ghost in the Shell<====>12914<====>Ghost in the Shell is a Japanese media franchise originally published as a seinen manga series of the same name written and illustrated by Masamune Shirow.  The manga, first serialized in 1989 under the subtitle of The Ghost in the Shell, and later published as its own tankōbon volumes by Kodansha, told the story of the fictional counter-cyberterrorist organization Public Security Section 9, led by protagonist Major Motoko Kusanagi, in the mid-21st century of Japan. Animation studio Production I. G has produced several different anime adaptations of Ghost in the Shell, starting with the 1995 film of the same name, telling the story of Section 9's investigation of the Puppet Master. 

Gauss–Legendre algorithm<====>12916<====>Gauss–Legendre algorithmThe Gauss–Legendre algorithm is an algorithm to compute the digits of π.  It is notable for being rapidly convergent, with only 25 iterations producing 45 million correct digits of π.  However, the drawback is that it is computer memory-intensive and therefore sometimes Machin-like formulas are used instead. The method is based on the individual work of Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752–1833) combined with modern algorithms for multiplication and square roots.  It repeatedly replaces two numbers by their arithmetic and geometric mean, in order to approximate their arithmetic-geometric mean. The version presented below is also known as the Gauss–Euler, Brent–Salamin (or Salamin–Brent) algorithm;  it was independently discovered in 1975 by Richard Brent and Eugene Salamin. 

Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search<====>12917<====>Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) is a collaborative project of volunteers who use freely available software to search for Mersenne prime numbers. The GIMPS project was founded by George Woltman, who also wrote the software Prime95 and MPrime for the project.  Scott Kurowski wrote the PrimeNet Internet server that supports the research to demonstrate Entropia-distributed computing software, a company he founded in 1997.  GIMPS is registered as Mersenne Research, Inc.  Kurowski is Executive Vice President and board director of Mersenne Research Inc.  GIMPS is said to be one of the first large scale distributed computing projects over the Internet for research purposes.

The first version of the Game. com includes two slots for game cartridges and can be connected to a 14. 4 kbit/s modem,    making it the first handheld to include Internet connectivity, hence its name referencing the top level domain . com.   A smaller version, the Game. com Pocket Pro, was released in September 1998, followed by a third version known as the Game. com Pocket. 

General Packet Radio Service<====>12920<====>General Packet Radio ServiceGeneral Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet oriented mobile data service on the 2G and 3G cellular communication system's global system for mobile communications (GSM).  GPRS was originally standardized by European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in response to the earlier CDPD and i-mode packet-switched cellular technologies.  It is now maintained by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).   GPRS usage is typically charged based on volume of data transferred, contrasting with circuit switched data, which is usually billed per minute of connection time.  Sometimes billing time is broken down to every third of a minute. 

Gnosis<====>12922<====>Gnosis  Gnosis is the common Greek noun for knowledge ( , gnôsis, f. ).   The term is used in various Hellenistic religions and philosophies.   Gnosticism, Encyclopædia Britannica  It is best known from Gnosticism, where it signifies a knowledge or insight into humanity’s real nature as divine, leading to the deliverance of the divine spark within humanity from the constraints of earthly existence.EtymologyGnosis is a feminine Greek noun which means "knowledge".

Georgian architecture<====>12924<====>Georgian architecture  Georgian architecture is the name given in most English-speaking countries to the set of architectural styles current between 1714 and 1830.  It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of Hanover—George I, George II, George III, and George IV—who reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830.  The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture.  In the United States the term "Georgian" is generally used to describe all buildings from the period, regardless of style; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are "architectural in intention",  and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period, though that covers a wide range. 

Goshen, Indiana<====>12926<====>Goshen, Indiana   Goshen   is a city in and the county seat of Elkhart County, Indiana, United States. It is the smaller of the two principal cities of the Elkhart-Goshen Metropolitan Statistical Area, which in turn is part of the South Bend-Elkhart-Mishawaka Combined Statistical Area.   It is located in the northern part of Indiana near the Michigan border, in a region known as Michiana.   Goshen is located 10 miles southeast of Elkhart, 25 miles southeast of South Bend, 120 miles east of Chicago, and 150 miles north of Indianapolis. 

Gallipoli<====>12929<====>Gallipoli  The Gallipoli peninsula ( ;   ;  ) is located in the southern part of East Thrace, the European part of Turkey, with the Aegean Sea to the west and the Dardanelles strait to the east. Gallipoli is the Italian form of the Greek name "Καλλίπολις" (Kallípolis), meaning "Beautiful City",  the original name of the modern town of Gelibolu.  In antiquity, the peninsula was known as the Thracian Chersonese ( , Thrakiké Chersónesos;  ). The peninsula runs in a south-westerly direction into the Aegean Sea, between the Hellespont (now known as the Dardanelles) and the bay of Melas (today Gulf of Saros). 

Gram stain<====>12935<====>Gram stainGram stain or Gram staining, also called Gram's method, is a method of staining used to distinguish and classify bacterial species into two large groups (gram-positive and gram-negative).  The name comes from the Danish bacteriologist Hans Christian Gram, who developed the technique. Gram staining differentiates bacteria by the chemical and physical properties of their cell walls by detecting peptidoglycan, which is present in the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria.  Gram-negative cells also contain peptidoglycan, but a very small layer of it that is dissolved when the alcohol is added.  This is why the cell loses its initial colour from the primary stain. 

Gram-positive bacteria<====>12936<====>Gram-positive bacteriaGram-positive bacteria are bacteria that give a positive result in the Gram stain test, which is traditionally used to quickly classify bacteria into two broad categories according to their cell wall. Gram-positive bacteria take up the crystal violet stain used in the test, and then appear to be purple-coloured when seen through a microscope.  This is because the thick peptidoglycan layer in the bacterial cell wall retains the stain after it is washed away from the rest of the sample, in the decolorization stage of the test. Gram-negative bacteria cannot retain the violet stain after the decolorization step; alcohol used in this stage degrades the outer membrane of Gram-negative cells, making the cell wall more porous and incapable of retaining the crystal violet stain. 

Gram-negative bacteria<====>12937<====>Gram-negative bacteria Gram-negative bacteria are a group of bacteria that do not retain the crystal violet stain used in the gram-staining method of  bacterial differentiation.They are characterized by their cell envelopes, which are composed of a thin peptidoglycan cell wall sandwiched between an inner cytoplasmic cell membrane and a bacterial outer membrane. Gram-negative bacteria are found everywhere, in virtually all environments on Earth that support life.  The gram-negative bacteria include the model organism Escherichia coli, as well as many pathogenic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Yersinia pestis.  They are an important medical challenge, as their outer membrane protects them from many antibiotics (including penicillin); detergents that would normally damage the peptidoglycans of the (inner) cell membrane; and lysozyme, an antimicrobial enzyme produced by animals that forms part of the innate immune system. 

Greyhound<====>12938<====>Greyhound {{Infobox dog breed }} The Greyhound is a breed of dog; a sighthound which has been bred for coursing game and Greyhound racing.  Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet. According to Merriam-Webster, a Greyhound is "any of a breed of tall slender graceful smooth-coated dogs characterized by swiftness and keen sight", as well as "any of several related dogs," such as the Italian Greyhound.  It is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding  . 

Geometric algebra<====>12939<====>Geometric algebra  The geometric algebra (GA) of a vector space is an algebra over a field, noted for its multiplication operation called the geometric product on a space of elements called multivectors, which is a superset of both the scalars  F  and the vector space  V .   Mathematically, a geometric algebra may be defined as the Clifford algebra of a vector space with a quadratic form.  Clifford's contribution was to define a new product, the geometric product, that united the Grassmann and Hamilton algebras into a single structure.  Adding the dual of the Grassmann exterior product (the "meet") allows the use of the Grassmann–Cayley algebra (known as 3D projective space or 4D homogeneous space and isomorphic to projective geometry) and a conformal version of the latter together with a conformal Clifford algebra yields a conformal geometric algebra (CGA) providing a framework for classical geometries. 

George Benson<====>12945<====>George Benson   George Benson (born March 22, 1943)    is an American musician, guitarist, and singer-songwriter.  He began his professional career at 21 as a jazz guitarist.  Benson uses a rest-stroke picking technique similar to that of gypsy jazz players such as Django Reinhardt. A former child prodigy, Benson first came to prominence in the 1960s, playing soul jazz with Jack McDuff and others.  He then launched a successful solo career, alternating between jazz, pop, R&B singing, and scat singing.  His album Breezin' was certified triple-platinum, hitting no.  1 on the Billboard album chart in 1976.

Grammatical tense<====>12947<====>Grammatical tense   In grammar, tense is a category that expresses time reference with reference to the moment of speaking.  Fabricius-Hansen, "Tense", in the Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics, 2nd ed. , 2006  Bernard Comrie, Aspect, 1976:6: "the semantic concept of time reference (absolute or relative), . . .  may be grammaticalized in a language, i. e.  a language may have a grammatical category that expresses time reference, in which case we say that the language has tenses.  Some languages lack tense, i. e.  do not have grammatical time reference, though probably all languages can lexicalize time reference, i. 

Grammatical aspect<====>12948<====>Grammatical aspect   Aspect is a grammatical category that expresses how an action, event, or state, denoted by a verb, extends over time.  Perfective aspect is used in referring to an event conceived as bounded and unitary, without reference to any flow of time during ("I helped him").  Imperfective aspect is used for situations conceived as existing continuously or repetitively as time flows ("I was helping him"; "I used to help people"). Further distinctions can be made, for example, to distinguish states and ongoing actions (continuous and progressive aspects) from repetitive actions (habitual aspect). Certain aspectual distinctions express a relation in time between the event and the time of reference. 

Glucose<====>12950<====>Glucose  Glucose is a simple sugar with the molecular formula C 6 H 12 O 6 , which means that it is a molecule that is made of six carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms, and six oxygen atoms.  Glucose circulates in the blood of animals as blood sugar.  It is made during photosynthesis from water and carbon dioxide, using energy from sunlight.  It is the most important source of energy for cellular respiration.  Glucose is stored as a polymer, in plants as starch and in animals as glycogen. With six carbon atoms, it is classed as a hexose, a subcategory of the monosaccharides. 

George Pólya<====>12955<====>George Pólya George Pólya ( ;  , pronounced  ; December 13, 1887 – September 7, 1985) was a Hungarian mathematician.  He was a professor of mathematics from 1914 to 1940 at ETH Zürich and from 1940 to 1953 at Stanford University.  He made fundamental contributions to combinatorics, number theory, numerical analysis and probability theory.  He is also noted for his work in heuristics and mathematics education.  Life and worksHe was born as Pólya György in Budapest, Austria-Hungary to Anna Deutsch and Jakab Pólya, Hungarian Jews who had converted to the Roman Catholic faith in 1886.

Functions performed include window definition, window control, and monitoring of keyboard and mouse input.  Routines for drawing a number of geometric primitives (both in solid and wireframe mode) are also provided, including cubes, spheres and the Utah teapot.  GLUT also has some limited support for creating pop-up menus. GLUT was written by Mark J.  Kilgard, author of OpenGL Programming for the X Window System and The Cg Tutorial: The Definitive Guide to Programmable Real-Time Graphics, while he was working for Silicon Graphics Inc. 

Giovanni Boccaccio<====>12957<====>Giovanni Boccaccio   Giovanni Boccaccio ( ;  ; 16 June 1313 – 21 December 1375)  was an Italian writer, poet, correspondent of Petrarch, and an important Renaissance humanist.  Boccaccio wrote a number of notable works, including The Decameron and On Famous Women.  He wrote his imaginative literature mostly in the Italian vernacular, as well as other works in Latin, and is particularly noted for his realistic dialogue which differed from that of his contemporaries, medieval writers who usually followed formulaic models for character and plot. Biography  The details of Boccaccio's birth are uncertain.  He was born in Florence or in a village near Certaldo where his family was from. 

Giuseppe Verdi<====>12958<====>Giuseppe Verdi   Giuseppe Fortunino Francesco Verdi ( ; 9 or 10 October 1813 – 27 January 1901) was an Italian opera composer. Verdi was born near Busseto to a provincial family of moderate means, and developed a musical education with the help of a local patron.   Verdi came to dominate the Italian opera scene after the era of Vincenzo Bellini, Gaetano Donizetti, and Gioachino Rossini, whose works significantly influenced him, becoming one of the pre-eminent opera composers in history. In his early operas, Verdi demonstrated a sympathy with the Risorgimento movement which sought the unification of Italy. 

German Navy<====>12960<====>German NavyThe German Navy (  or simply  — ) is the navy of Germany and part of the unified Bundeswehr ("Federal Defense"), the German Armed Forces.  The German Navy was originally known as the Bundesmarine ("Federal Navy") from 1956 until 1995 when Deutsche Marine ("German Navy") became the official name with respect to the 1990 incorporation of the East German Volksmarine ("People's Navy").  It is deeply integrated into the NATO alliance.  Its primary mission is protection of Germany's territorial waters and maritime infrastructure as well as sea lines of communication.

Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid<====>12962<====>Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acidDISPLAYTITLE  γ-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), also known as 4-hydroxybutanoic acid, is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter and a psychoactive drug.  It is a precursor to GABA, glutamate, and glycine in certain brain areas, and it acts on the GHB receptor and it is a weak agonist at the GABA B  receptor. GHB has been used in a medical setting as a general anesthetic and as a treatment for cataplexy, narcolepsy, and alcoholism. It is also used illegally as an intoxicant, to try to increase athletic performance, and as a date rape drug.   It is commonly used in the form of a salt, such as sodium γ-hydroxybutyrate (Na. 

Giordano Bruno<====>12963<====>Giordano BrunoGiordano Bruno ( ;  ;  ; 1548 – 17 February 1600), born Filippo Bruno, was an Italian Dominican friar, philosopher, mathematician, poet, and cosmological theorist.   He is known for his cosmological theories, which conceptually extended the then-novel Copernican model.  He proposed that the stars were just distant suns surrounded by their own exoplanets and raised the possibility that these planets could even foster life of their own (a philosophical position known as cosmic pluralism).  He also insisted that the universe is in fact infinite and could have no celestial body at its "center". 

Geddy Lee<====>12964<====>Geddy Lee   Geddy Lee Weinrib,    (born Gary Lee Weinrib; July 29, 1953), known professionally as Geddy Lee, is a Canadian musician, singer, and songwriter best known as the lead vocalist, bassist, and keyboardist for the Canadian rock group Rush.  Lee joined what would become Rush in September 1968, at the request of his childhood friend Alex Lifeson, replacing original bassist and frontman Jeff Jones.    Lee's first solo effort, My Favourite Headache, was released in 2000. An award-winning musician, Lee's style, technique, and skill on the bass guitar have inspired many rock musicians such as Cliff Burton of Metallica,Steve Harris of Iron Maiden,    John Myung of Dream Theater,    and Les Claypool of Primus. 

Geologic time scale<====>12967<====>Geologic time scale The geologic time scale (GTS) is a system of chronological dating that relates geological strata (stratigraphy) to time.  It is used by geologists, paleontologists, and other Earth scientists to describe the timing and relationships of events that have occurred during Earth's history.  The tables of geologic time spans, presented here, agree with the nomenclature, dates and standard color codes set forth by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS).  Terminology The primary defined divisions of time are eons, in sequence the Hadean, the Archean, the Proterozoic and the Phanerozoic. The first three of these can be referred to collectively as the Precambrian supereon.

Gambler's fallacy<====>12970<====>Gambler's fallacyThe gambler's fallacy, also known as the Monte Carlo fallacy or the fallacy of the maturity of chances, is the mistaken belief that, if something happens more frequently than normal during some period, it will happen less frequently in the future, or that, if something happens less frequently than normal during some period, it will happen more frequently in the future (presumably as a means of balancing nature).  In situations where what is being observed is truly random (i. e. , independent trials of a random process), this belief, though appealing to the human mind, is false.   This fallacy can arise in many practical situations, but is most strongly associated with gambling, where such mistakes are common among players.

Gastroenterology<====>12976<====>Gastroenterology   Gastroenterology (MeSH heading)  is the branch of medicine focused on the digestive system and its disorders. Diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract, which include the organs from mouth to anus, along the alimentary canal, are the focus of this speciality.  Physicians practicing in this field are called gastroenterologists.  They have usually completed about eight years of pre-medical and medical education, a year-long internship (if this is not a part of the residency), three years of an internal medicine residency, and two to three years in the gastroenterology fellowship.  Gastroenterologists perform a number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures including colonoscopy, endoscopy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiancreatography (ERCP), endoscopic ultrasound and liver biopsy. 

Gulag<====>12980<====>Gulag  The Gulag ( ; acronym of  ,  , Main Camps' Administration or Chief Administration of [Corrective Labor] Camps) was the government agency in charge of the Soviet forced labor camp system which reached its peak during Joseph Stalin's rule from the 1930s to the 1950s.  The term is also commonly used in English language to refer to any forced-labor camp in the Soviet Union, including camps that existed in post-Stalin times.    The camps housed a wide range of convicts, from petty criminals to political prisoners.  Large numbers were convicted by simplified procedures, such as NKVD troikas and other instruments of extrajudicial punishment. 

Geiger counter<====>12984<====>Geiger counter The Geiger counter is an instrument used for measuring ionizing radiation used widely in applications such as radiation dosimetry, radiological protection, experimental physics and the nuclear industry. It detects ionizing radiation such as alpha particles, beta particles and gamma rays using the ionization effect produced in a Geiger–Müller tube; which gives its name to the instrument.   In wide and prominent use as a hand-held radiation survey instrument, it is perhaps one of the world's best-known radiation detection instruments. The original detection principle was discovered in 1908 at the Cavendish laboratory, but it was not until the development of the Geiger-Müller tube in 1928 that the Geiger-Müller counter became a practical instrument.

Gerrymandering<====>12987<====>Gerrymandering  Gerrymandering is a practice intended to establish a political advantage for a particular party or group by manipulating district boundaries.  The resulting district is known as a gerrymander (  or  ), however that word is also a verb for the process.    The term gerrymandering has negative connotations.  Two principal tactics are used in gerrymandering: "cracking" (i. e.  diluting the voting power of the opposing party's supporters across many districts) and "packing" (concentrating the opposing party's voting power in one district to reduce their voting power in other districts). 

Gin<====>12988<====>Gin Gin is liquor which derives its predominant flavour from juniper berries (Juniperus communis).  Gin is one of the broadest categories of spirits, all of various origins, styles, and flavour profiles that revolve around juniper as a common ingredient.    From its earliest origins in the Middle Ages, the drink has evolved from a herbal medicine to an object of commerce in the spirits industry.  Gin was developed based on the older Dutch liquor, jenever, and became popular in Great Britain (particularly in London) when William of Orange, leader of the Dutch Republic, occupied the English, Scottish, and Irish thrones with his wife Mary between 1689 and 1702. 

Gall–Peters projection<====>12990<====>Gall–Peters projectionThe Gall–Peters projection is a rectangular map projection that maps all areas such that they have the correct sizes relative to each other.  Like any equal-area projection, it achieves this goal by distorting most shapes.  The projection is a particular example of the cylindrical equal-area projection with latitudes 45° north and south as the regions on the map that have no distortion. The projection is named after James Gall and Arno Peters.  Gall is credited with describing the projection in 1855 at a science convention.  He published a paper on it in 1885.Peters brought the projection to a wider audience beginning in the early 1970s by means of the "Peters World Map".

Besides recording as a solo artist, he played with the International Submarine Band, The Byrds, and The Flying Burrito Brothers.  His relatively short career is described by AllMusic as "enormously influential" for country and rock, "blending the two genres to the point that they became indistinguishable from each other. 

Go-fast boat<====>12992<====>Go-fast boat  A go-fast boat is a small, fast boat designed with a long narrow platform and a planing hull to enable it to reach high speeds. During the era of Prohibition in the United States, these boats joined the ranks of "rum-runners" transferring illegal liquor from larger vessels waiting outside U. S.  territorial waters to the mainland.  The high speed of such craft enabled them to avoid interception by the Coast Guard.  More recently the term "cigarette boat" has replaced the term "rum-runner".  The present era of cigarette boats, dating from the 1960s, owes much of their design to boats designed for offshore powerboat racing, particularly by designer and builder Donald Aronow.

Grok<====>12998<====>Grok  Grok   is a word coined by American writer Robert A.  Heinlein for his 1961 science fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land.   While the Oxford English Dictionary summarizes the meaning of grok as "to understand intuitively or by empathy, to establish rapport with" and "to empathize or communicate sympathetically (with); also, to experience enjoyment",  Heinlein's concept is far more nuanced, with critic Istvan Csicsery-Ronay Jr.  observing that "the book's major theme can be seen as an extended definition of the term".    The concept of grok garnered significant critical scrutiny in the years after the book's initial publication.

-gry puzzle<====>13031<====>-gry puzzle The -gry puzzle is a popular word puzzle that asks for the third English word that ends with the letters -gry other than angry and hungry.  Specific wording varies substantially, but the puzzle has no clear answer, as there are no other common English words that end in -gry.Interpretations of the puzzle suggest it is either an answerless hoax; a trick question; a sincere question asking for an obscure word; or a corruption of more straightforward puzzle, which may have asked for words containing -gry (such as gryphon).  Of these, countless trick question variants and obscure English words (or nonce words) have been proposed.

Geyser<====>13034<====>Geyser    A geyser ( ;   or    ) is a spring characterized by intermittent discharge of water ejected turbulently and accompanied by steam. As a fairly rare phenomenon, the formation of geysers is due to particular hydrogeological conditions that exist in only a few places on Earth.  Generally all geyser field sites are located near active volcanic areas, and the geyser effect is due to the proximity of magma.  Generally, surface water works its way down to an average depth of around   where it contacts hot rocks.  The resultant boiling of the pressurized water results in the geyser effect of hot water and steam spraying out of the geyser's surface vent (a hydrothermal explosion). 

Gaussian elimination<====>13035<====>Gaussian eliminationIn linear algebra, Gaussian elimination (also known as row reduction) is an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations.  It is usually understood as a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients.  This method can also be used to find the rank of a matrix, to calculate the determinant of a matrix, and to calculate the inverse of an invertible square matrix.  The method is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855), although it was known to Chinese mathematicians as early as 179 CE (see History section). To perform row reduction on a matrix, one uses a sequence of elementary row operations to modify the matrix until the lower left-hand corner of the matrix is filled with zeros, as much as possible. 

Guantanamo Bay Naval Base<====>13037<====>Guantanamo Bay Naval Base Guantanamo Bay Naval Base ( ), officially known as Naval Station Guantanamo Bay or NSGB (also called GTMO because of the airfield designation code or Gitmo because of the common pronunciation of this code by the U.

Gypsum<====>13040<====>Gypsum   Gypsum is a soft sulfate mineral composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate, with the chemical formula CaSO 4 ·2H 2 O.   It is widely mined and is used as a fertilizer, and as the main constituent in many forms of plaster, blackboard chalk and wallboard.   A massive fine-grained white or lightly tinted variety of gypsum, called alabaster, has been used for sculpture by many cultures including Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Ancient Rome, the Byzantine Empire and the Nottingham alabasters of Medieval England.  Mohs scale of mineral hardness, based on scratch hardness comparison, defines hardness value 2 as gypsum. 

Growth factor<====>13041<====>Growth factor  A growth factor is a naturally occurring substance capable of stimulating cellular growth,  proliferation, healing, and cellular differentiation.  Usually it is a protein or a steroid hormone.  Growth factors are important for regulating a variety of cellular processes. Growth factors typically act as signaling molecules between cells.  Examples are cytokines and hormones that bind to specific receptors on the surface of their target cells. They often promote cell differentiation and maturation, which varies between growth factors.  For example, bone morphogenetic proteins stimulate bone cell differentiation, while fibroblast growth factors and vascular endothelial growth factors stimulate blood vessel differentiation (angiogenesis). 

Giuseppe Peano<====>13043<====>Giuseppe Peano  Giuseppe Peano ( ; 27 August 1858 – 20 April 1932) was an Italian mathematician and glottologist.  The author of over 200 books and papers, he was a founder of mathematical logic and set theory, to which he contributed much notation.  The standard axiomatization of the natural numbers is named the Peano axioms in his honor.  As part of this effort, he made key contributions to the modern rigorous and systematic treatment of the method of mathematical induction.  He spent most of his career teaching mathematics at the University of Turin. He also wrote an international auxiliary language, the 'Latin sine flexione' ("Latin without inflections"), which is a simplified version of the Classical Latin. 

Gin and tonic<====>13044<====>Gin and tonic A gin and tonic is a highball cocktail made with gin and tonic water poured over ice.  It is usually garnished with a slice or wedge of lime.  The amount of gin varies according to taste.  Suggested ratios of gin to tonic are between 1:1 and 1:3. In some countries (e. g.  UK), gin and tonic is also marketed pre-mixed in single-serving cans.  The drink is a particular phenomenon as its taste is quite different from the taste of its constituent liquids which are rather bitter.  The chemical structures of both ingredients are of a similar molecular shape and attract each other, shielding the bitter taste. 

Gimlet (tool)<====>13045<====>Gimlet (tool) A gimlet is a hand tool for drilling small holes, mainly in wood, without splitting.   It was defined in Joseph Gwilt's Architecture (1859) as "a piece of steel of a semi-cylindrical form, hollow on one side, having a cross handle at one end and a worm or screw at the other".   A gimlet is always a small tool.  A similar tool of larger size is called an auger.  The cutting action of the gimlet is slightly different from an auger, however, as the end of the screw, and so the initial hole it makes, is smaller; the cutting edges pare away the wood which is moved out by the spiral sides, falling out through the entry hole. 

Geometric mean<====>13046<====>Geometric mean In mathematics, the geometric mean is a type of mean or average, which indicates the central tendency or typical value of a set of numbers by using the product of their values (as opposed to the arithmetic mean which uses their sum).  The geometric mean is defined as the  th root of the product of   numbers, i. e. , for a set of numbers  , the geometric mean is defined as \left(\prod_{i=1}^n x_i\right)^\frac{1}{n} = \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n} For instance, the geometric mean of two numbers, say 2 and 8, is just the square root of their product, that is,  \sqrt{2\cdot 8}=4 .

Game show<====>13135<====>Game show   A game show is a type of radio, television, or stage show in which contestants, individually or as teams, play a game which involves answering questions or solving puzzles, usually for money or prizes.  Alternatively, a gameshow can be a demonstrative program about a game (while usually retaining the spirit of an awards ceremony).  In the former, contestants may be invited from a pool of public applicants.  Game shows often reward players with prizes such as cash, trips and goods and services provided by the show's sponsor prize suppliers. History1930s–1950sTelevision game shows descended from similar programs on radio. 

Grindcore<====>13137<====>Grindcore  Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s, drawing inspiration from the most abrasive-sounding musical styles: hardcore punk, extreme metal, industrial and noise rock.  Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks.  Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style.  It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum.  Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor. 

George Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach<====>13140<====>George Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach  George Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach ( ; 5 April 1539 in Ansbach – 25 April 1603) was Margrave of Ansbach and Bayreuth, as well as Regent of Prussia.  He was the son of George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach and a member of the House of Hohenzollern.  He married firstly, in 1559, Elisabeth of Brandenburg-Küstrin (29 August 1540 – 8 March 1578).

George Frederick reigned in his native Ansbach, Franconia and Jägerndorf, Upper Silesia since 1556 and, after the death of his cousin Albert Alcibiades in 1557, also in Kulmbach. 

George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach<====>13141<====>George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach  George of Brandenburg-Ansbach ( ) (4 March 1484 – 27 December 1543), known as George the Pious, was a Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach from the House of Hohenzollern. BiographyEarly lifeHe was born in Ansbach, the third of eight sons of Margrave Frederick the Elder and his wife Sophia of Poland, daughter of Casimir IV of Poland and Elisabeth of Habsburg.   Through his mother, he was related to the royal court in Buda.   He entered the service of his uncle, King Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary, living at his court from 1506. 

Generalized mean<====>13143<====>Generalized mean In mathematics, generalized means are a family of functions for aggregating sets of numbers, that include as special cases the Pythagorean means (arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means).  The generalized mean is also known as power mean or Hölder mean (named after Otto Hölder). DefinitionIf p is a non-zero real number, and  x_1,\dots,x_n  are positive real numbers, then the generalized mean or power mean with exponent p of these positive real numbers is: M_p(x_1,\dots,x_n) = \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^p \right)^{\frac{1}{p}} .  Note the relationship to the p-norm.  For   we set it equal to the geometric mean (which is the limit of means with exponents approaching zero, as proved below): M_0(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \sqrt[n]{\prod_{i=1}^n x_i} Furthermore, for a sequence of positive weights w i  with sum  \sum w_i = 1  we define the weighted power mean as: \begin{align} M_p(x_1,\dots,x_n) &= \left(\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i^p \right)^{\frac{1}{p}} \\ M_0(x_1,\dots,x_n) &= \prod_{i=1}^n x_i^{w_i}\end{align} The unweighted means correspond to setting all  . 

Gerolamo Cardano<====>13145<====>Gerolamo CardanoGerolamo (or Girolamo,  or Geronimo) Cardano ( ;  ;  ; 24 September 1501 – 21 September 1576) was an Italian polymath, whose interests and proficiencies ranged from being a mathematician, physician, biologist, physicist, chemist, astrologer, astronomer, philosopher, writer, and gambler.   He was one of the most influential mathematicians of the Renaissance, and was one of the key figures in the foundation of probability and the earliest introducer of the binomial coefficients and the binomial theorem in the western world.  He wrote more than 200 works on science.    Cardano partially invented and described several mechanical devices including the combination lock, the gimbal consisting of three concentric rings allowing a supported compass or gyroscope to rotate freely, and the Cardan shaft with universal joints, which allows the transmission of rotary motion at various angles and is used in vehicles to this day. 

Gabbro<====>13146<====>Gabbro Gabbro ( ) refers to a large group of dark, often phaneritic (coarse-grained), mafic intrusive igneous rocks chemically equivalent to basalt.  It forms when molten magma is trapped beneath the Earth's surface and slowly cools into a holocrystalline mass. Much of the Earth's oceanic crust is made of gabbro, formed at mid-ocean ridges.  Gabbro is also found as plutons associated with continental volcanism.  Due to its variant nature, the term "gabbro" may be applied loosely to a wide range of intrusive rocks, many of which are merely "gabbroic".  EtymologyThe term "gabbro" was used in the 1760s to name a set of rock types that were found in the ophiolites of the Apennine Mountains in Italy. 

Gene Roddenberry<====>13148<====>Gene Roddenberry    Eugene Wesley Roddenberry (August 19, 1921 – October 24, 1991) was an American television screenwriter and producer.  He is best remembered for creating the original Star Trek television series.  Born in El Paso, Texas, Roddenberry grew up in Los Angeles, where his father was a police officer.  Roddenberry flew 89 combat missions in the Army Air Forces during World War II, and worked as a commercial pilot after the war.  Later, he followed in his father's footsteps and joined the Los Angeles Police Department, where he also began to write scripts for television. 

Galaxy Quest<====>13149<====>Galaxy Quest   Galaxy Quest is a 1999 American comic science fiction film directed by Dean Parisot and written by David Howard and Robert Gordon.  A parody of science fiction films and series, particularly Star Trek and its fandom, the film stars Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub, Sam Rockwell, and Daryl Mitchell as the cast of a defunct cult television series called Galaxy Quest, in which the crew of a spaceship embarked on intergalactic adventures, who are suddenly visited by actual aliens who believe the series to be an accurate documentary, and become involved in a very real intergalactic conflict. 

Gilgamesh<====>13151<====>Gilgamesh    Gilgamesh (   or  ;    , Gilgameš, originally Bilgamesh  ) is the main character in the Epic of Gilgamesh, an Akkadian poem that is considered the first great work of literature,  and in earlier Sumerian poems.  In the epic, Gilgamesh is a demigod of superhuman strength who builds the city walls of Uruk to defend his people and, after the death of his friend Enkidu, then travels to meet the sage Utnapishtim, who had survived the Great Flood.    His name translates roughly to mean "The Ancestor is a Young-man",  from Bil. 

Gluten<====>13152<====>GlutenGluten (from Latin gluten, "glue") is a composite of storage proteins termed prolamins and glutelins    and stored together with starch in the endosperm (which nourishes the embryonic plant during germination) of various cereal (grass) grains.  It is found in wheat, barley, rye, oat, related species and hybrids (such as spelt, khorasan, emmer, einkorn, triticale, kamut, etc. )and products of these (such as malt).  Glutens, and most especially the Triticeae glutens, are appreciated for their viscoelastic properties. It gives elasticity to dough, helping it rise and keep its shape and often gives the final product a chewy texture. 

Glen or Glenda<====>13154<====>Glen or Glenda  Glen or Glenda is a 1953 American drama film written, directed by and starring Ed Wood (credited in his starring role as "Daniel Davis"), and featuring Bela Lugosi and Wood's then-girlfriend Dolores Fuller. The film is a docudrama about cross-dressing and transsexuality, and is semi-autobiographical in nature.  Wood himself was a cross-dresser, and the film is a plea for tolerance.  It is widely considered one of the worst films ever.  However, it has become a cult film due to its low-budget production values and idiosyncratic style. Plot The film begins with a narrator, called The Scientist (Bela Lugosi), making cryptic comments about humanity. 

The Golden Turkey Awards<====>13155<====>The Golden Turkey Awards The Golden Turkey Awards is a 1980 book by film critic Michael Medved and his brother Harry. AboutThe book awards "Golden Turkey Awards" to films judged by the authors as poor in quality, and to directors and actors judged to have created a chronically inept body of work.  The book features many low-budget obscurities and exploitation films such as Rat Pfink a Boo Boo, Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, and the apparently lost Him.  Other categories include expensive, big studio failures like The Swarm and popular films such as Jesus Christ Superstar. In the introduction the authors admit that "we know our choices will not please everyone—least of all the actors, producers, writers and directors who are honored in the pages that follow. 

George Fox<====>13156<====>George Fox    George Fox (July 1624  – 13 January 1691) was an English Dissenter and a founder of the Religious Society of Friends, commonly known as the Quakers or Friends. The son of a Leicestershire weaver, Fox lived in a time of great social upheaval and war.  He rebelled against the religious and political authorities by proposing an unusual and uncompromising approach to the Christian faith.  He travelled throughout Britain as a dissenting preacher, for which he was often persecuted by the authorities who disapproved of his beliefs. In 1669, Fox married Margaret Fell, the widow of one of his wealthier supporters; she was a leading Friend. 

Gilles Apap<====>13158<====>Gilles Apap  Gilles Apap (born 21 May 1963) is a French classical violinist.  Born in Béjaïa, Algeria, he was raised in Nice, France.  In 1985 he won first prize in the contemporary music category at the Yehudi Menuhin Competition.  He served as concertmaster with the Santa Barbara Symphony Orchestra for 10 years, but has since focused on his career as a soloist with orchestras around the world. A virtuosic violinist, Gilles is also known for his interpretations of traditional music from Eastern Europe to America, such as gypsy, Irish, swing or bluegrass. He recorded three CDs in the 1990s with Sony Classical Records, then formed his own company, Apapaziz Productions. 

Gunpowder Plot<====>13159<====>Gunpowder Plot    The Gunpowder Plot of 1605, in earlier centuries often called the Gunpowder Treason Plot or the Jesuit Treason, was a failed assassination attempt against King James I of England and VI of Scotland by a group of provincial English Catholics led by Robert Catesby. The plan was to blow up the House of Lords during the State Opening of England's Parliament on 5 November 1605, as the prelude to a popular revolt in the Midlands during which James's nine-year-old daughter, Princess Elizabeth, was to be installed as the Catholic head of state.  Catesby may have embarked on the scheme after hopes of securing greater religious tolerance under King James had faded, leaving many English Catholics disappointed. 

Gelatin<====>13160<====>Gelatin  Gelatin or gelatine (from   meaning "stiff", "frozen") is a translucent, colorless, brittle (when dry), flavorless food derived from collagen obtained from various animal body parts.  It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food, pharmaceutical drugs, vitamin capsules, photography, and cosmetic manufacturing. Substances containing gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called "gelatinous".  Gelatin is an irreversibly hydrolyzed form of collagen, wherein the hydrolysis results in the reduction of protein fibrils into smaller peptides, which will have broad molecular weight ranges associated with physical and chemical methods of denaturation, based on the process of hydrolysis. 

Gelatin dessert<====>13162<====>Gelatin dessert  Gelatin desserts are desserts made with sweetened and flavored gelatin.  This kind of dessert is first recorded by Hannah Glasse in her 18th century book The Art of Cookery. They can be made by combining plain gelatin with other ingredients or by using a premixed blend of gelatin with additives.  Fully prepared gelatin desserts are sold in a variety of forms, ranging from large decorative shapes to individual serving cups. HistoryBefore gelatin became widely available as a commercial product, the most typical gelatin dessert was "calf's foot jelly".  As the name indicates, this was made by extracting and purifying gelatin from the foot of a calf. 

George, Duke of Saxony<====>13168<====>George, Duke of Saxony  George the Bearded, Duke of Saxony (Meissen, 27 August 1471 – Dresden, 17 April 1539), was duke of Saxony from 1500 to 1539. Duke George was a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece. Early lifeHis father was Albert the Brave of Saxony, founder of the Albertine line of the Wettin family, his mother was Sidonie, daughter of George Podiebrad, King of Bohemia.  Elector Frederick the Wise, a member of the Ernestine branch of the same family, known for his protection of Luther, was a cousin of Duke George.    George, as the eldest son, received an excellent training in theology and other branches of learning, and was thus much better educated than most of the princes of his day. 

Gneiss<====>13169<====>Gneiss Gneiss ( ) is a common  distributed type of rock formed by high-grade regional metamorphic processes from pre-existing formations that were originally either igneous or sedimentary rocks.  It is often foliated (composed of layers of sheet-like planar structures).  The foliations are characterized by alternating darker and lighter colored bands, called "gneissic banding". EtymologyThe word gneiss has been used in English since at least 1757.  It is borrowed from the German word Gneis, formerly also spelt Gneiss, which is probably derived from the Middle High German noun   "spark" (so called because the rock glitters). 

Gro Harlem Brundtland<====>13171<====>Gro Harlem Brundtland  Gro Harlem Brundtland ( ; born Gro Harlem, 20 April 1939) is a Norwegian politician, who served three terms as Prime Minister of Norway (1981, 1986–89, and 1990–96) and as Director-General of the World Health Organization from 1998 to 2003.  She is also known for having chaired the Brundtland Commission which presented the Brundtland Report on sustainable development. Educated as a physician, Brundtland joined the Labour Party and entered the government in 1974 as Minister of the Environment.  She became the first female Prime Minister of Norway on 4 February 1981, but left office already on 14 October 1981; she returned as Prime Minister on 9 May 1986 and served until 16 October 1989.

He is widely considered the most accomplished rhetorical stylist of the patristic age.  McGuckin, John (2001) Saint Gregory of Nazianzus: An Intellectual Biography, Crestwood, NY.    As a classically trained orator and philosopher he infused Hellenism into the early church, establishing the paradigm of Byzantine theologians and church officials. 

HTML<====>13191<====>HTMLHypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.  With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.   Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages.  HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.  With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page.

Hector<====>13207<====>Hector   In Greek mythology and Roman Mythology, Hector (  Hektōr,  ) was a Trojan prince and the greatest fighter for Troy in the Trojan War.  As the first-born son of King Priam and Queen Hecuba, who was a descendant of Dardanus and Tros, the founder of Troy,  he was a prince of the royal house and the heir apparent to his father's throne.  He was married to Andromache, with whom he had an infant son, Scamandrius (whom the people of Troy called Astyanax).  He acted as leader of the Trojans and their allies in the defense of Troy, "killing 31,000 Greek fighters", offers Hyginus. 

Hera<====>13208<====>HeraHera ( ;   Hērā, equivalently   Hērē, in Ionic and Homer) is the goddess of women and marriage in Greek mythology and religion.  She is the daughter of the Titans Cronus and Rhea. Hera is married to her brother Zeus and is titled as the Queen of Heaven.  One of her characteristics is her jealous and vengeful nature against Zeus's other lovers and offspring and against the mortals who cross her.  Hera is commonly seen with the animals she considers sacred including the cow, lion and the peacock.  Portrayed as majestic and solemn, often enthroned, and crowned with the polos (a high cylindrical crown worn by several of the Great Goddesses), Hera may hold a pomegranate in her hand, emblem of fertile blood and death and a substitute for the narcotic capsule of the opium poppy. 

History of the ancient Levant<====>13210<====>History of the ancient Levant   The Levant is a geographical term that refers to a large area in Southwest Asia, south of the Taurus Mountains, bounded by the Mediterranean Sea in the west, the Arabian Desert in the south, and Mesopotamia in the east.  It stretches 400 miles north to south from the Taurus Mountains to the Sinai desert, and 70 to 100 miles east to west between the sea and the Arabian desert.   The term is also sometimes used to refer to modern events or states in the region immediately bordering the eastern Mediterranean Sea: Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria. 

History of Europe<====>13212<====>History of Europe The history of Europe covers the peoples inhabiting Europe from prehistory to the present. The period known as classical antiquity began with the emergence of the city-states of ancient Greece.  Later, the Roman Empire came to dominate the entire Mediterranean basin.  The fall of the Roman Empire in AD 476 traditionally marks the start of the Middle Ages.   Beginning in the 14th century a Renaissance of knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology.  Simultaneously, the Protestant Reformation set up Protestant churches primarily in Germany, Scandinavia and England.   After 1800, the Industrial Revolution brought prosperity to Britain and Western Europe. 

Hold come what may<====>13216<====>Hold come what mayHold come what may is a phrase popularized by logician Willard Van Orman Quine.  Beliefs that are "held come what may" are beliefs one is unwilling to give up, regardless of any evidence with which one might be presented.Quine held (on a perhaps simplistic construal) that there are no beliefs that one ought to hold come what may—in other words, that all beliefs are rationally revisable ("no statement is immune to revision"), and compared this to the simplification of quantum mechanics.  Many philosophers argue to the contrary, believing that, for example, the laws of thought cannot be revised and may be "held come what may". 

Haiku<====>13217<====>Haiku (plural haiku) is a very short form of Japanese poetry.   It is typically characterized by three qualities:The essence of haiku is "cutting" (kiru). This is often  represented by the juxtaposition of two images or ideas and a kireji ("cutting word") between them,a kind of verbal punctuation mark which signals the moment of separation and colours the manner in which the juxtaposed elements are related. Traditional haiku consist of 17 on (also known as morae though often loosely translated as "syllables"), in three phrases of 5, 7, and 5 on, respectively. 

Howard Hawks<====>13219<====>Howard Hawks  Howard Winchester Hawks (May 30, 1896 December 26, 1977) was an American film director, producer and screenwriter of the classic Hollywood era.  Critic Leonard Maltin called him "the greatest American director who is not a household name. " Hawks was a versatile director whose career included comedies, dramas, gangster films, science fiction, film noir, and westerns.  Wheeler Winston Dixon and Gwendolyn Audrey Foster, A Short History of Film (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press) p.  99—101.   .   His most popular films include Scarface (1932),  Bringing Up Baby (1938), Only Angels Have Wings (1939), His Girl Friday (1940), To Have and Have Not (1944), The Big Sleep (1946), Red River (1948), The Thing from Another World (1951), and Rio Bravo (1959). 

History of Germany<====>13224<====>History of Germany The concept of Germany as a distinct region in central Europe can be traced to Roman commander Julius Caesar, who referred to the unconquered area east of the Rhine as Germania, thus distinguishing it from Gaul (France), which he had conquered.  The victory of the Germanic tribes in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (AD 9) prevented annexation by the Roman Empire, although the Roman provinces of Germania Superior and Germania Inferior were established along the Rhine.  Following the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Franks conquered the other West Germanic tribes.  When the Frankish Empire was divided among Charlemagne's heirs in 843, the eastern part became East Francia. 

Hades<====>13225<====>Hades    Hades ( ;   Háidēs) was the ancient Greek chthonic god of the underworld, which eventually took his name.  In Greek mythology, Hades was regarded as the oldest son of Cronus and Rhea, although the last son regurgitated by his father.   He and his brothers Zeus and Poseidon defeated their father's generation of gods, the Titans, and claimed rulership over the cosmos.  Hades received the underworld, Zeus the sky, and Poseidon the sea, with the solid earth—long the province of Gaia—available to all three concurrently.  Hades was often portrayed with his three-headed guard dog Cerberus. 

GNU Hurd<====>13236<====>GNU Hurd  GNU Hurd is the multiserver microkernel written as part of GNU.  It has been under development since 1990 by the GNU Project of the Free Software Foundation, designed as a replacement for the Unix kernel,  and released as free software under the GNU General Public License.  While the Linux kernel soon proved to be a more viable solution, development of GNU Hurd continued, albeit at a slow pace.    GNU Hurd consists of a set of protocols and server processes (or daemons, in Unix terminology) that run on the GNU Mach microkernel. 

Hollywood cycles<====>13240<====>Hollywood cycles In the classic era of the cinema of the United States (1930 – 1945) "cycles" or genres matured.  They were called cycles, which was a short term for stories that were similar.  While we would recognize many of the genres as Westerns, gangsters, musicals, etc., often the cycles were significantly more specific.  Instead of "romantic comedy" it might be "Boy-meets-girl-boy-loses-girl-boy-gets-girl" cycle.See alsoFilm theoryFilm genreFormula fiction In literary works, generic storylines are referred to as formula fiction.DEFAULTSORT 

Health care reform<====>13250<====>Health care reformHealth care reform is a general rubric used for discussing major health policy creation or changes—for the most part, governmental policy that affects health care delivery in a given place.  Health care reform typically attempts to:Broaden the population that receives health care coverage through either public sector insurance programs or private sector insurance companiesExpand the array of health care providers consumers may choose amongImprove the access to health care specialistsImprove the quality of health careGive more care to citizensDecrease the cost of health careUnited States  In the United States, the debate regarding health care reform includes questions of a right to health care, access, fairness, sustainability, quality and amounts spent by government. 

Henry Mayhew<====>13253<====>Henry Mayhew  Henry Mayhew (25 November 1812 – 25 July 1887) was an English social researcher, journalist, playwright and advocate of reform.  He was one of the co-founders of the satirical and humorous magazine Punch in 1841, and was the magazine's joint-editor, with Mark Lemon, in its early days.  He is also known for his work as a social researcher, publishing an extensive series of newspaper articles in the Morning Chronicle that was later compiled into the book series London Labour and the London Poor (1851), a groundbreaking and influential survey of the city's poor. BiographyEarly lifeHe was born in London, one of seventeen children of Joshua Mayhew. 

Hydrogen<====>13255<====>HydrogenHydrogen is a chemical element with symbol H and atomic number 1.  With a standard atomic weight of  , hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table.  Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass.However, most of the universe's mass is not in the form of baryons or chemical elements.  See dark matter and dark energy.   Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state.  The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed protium (name rarely used, symbol  1 H), has one proton and no neutrons. 

Helium<====>13256<====>Helium   Helium (from  ) is a chemical element with symbol He and atomic number 2.  It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table.  Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements.  After hydrogen, helium is the second lightest and second most abundant element in the observable universe, being present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined.  Its abundance is similar to this figure in the Sun and in Jupiter. 

Hydrocarbon<====>13257<====>Hydrocarbon In organic chemistry, a hydrocarbon is an organic compound consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon,  and thus are group 14 hydrides.  Hydrocarbons, from which one hydrogen atom has been removed, are functional groups called hydrocarbyls.   Because carbon has 4 electrons in its outermost shell (and because each covalent bond requires a donation of 1 electron, per atom, to the bond) carbon has exactly four bonds to make, and is only stable if all 4 of these bonds are used. Aromatic hydrocarbons (arenes), alkanes, cycloalkanes and alkyne-based compounds are different types of hydrocarbons.  Most hydrocarbons found on Earth naturally occur in crude oil, where decomposed organic matter provides an abundance of carbon and hydrogen which, when bonded, can catenate to form seemingly limitless chains. 

Halogen<====>13258<====>Halogen  The halogens (    ) are a group in the periodic table consisting of five chemically related elements: fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At).  The artificially created element 117 (tennessine, Ts) may also be a halogen.  In the modern IUPAC nomenclature, this group is known as group 17.  The symbol X is often used generically to refer to any halogen. The name "halogen" means "salt-producing".  When halogens react with metals they produce a wide range of salts, including calcium fluoride, sodium chloride (common table salt), silver bromide and potassium iodide. 

Home page<====>13259<====>Home page    A home page or a start page is the initial or main web page of a website or a browser.  The initial page of a website is sometimes called main page as well. Website home pageA home page is generally the main page a visitor navigating to a website from a web search engine will see, and it may also serve as a landing page to attract visitors. The home page is used to facilitate navigation to other pages on the site by providing links to prioritized and recent articles and pages, and possibly a search box. 

Hee Haw<====>13260<====>Hee Haw   Hee Haw was an American television variety show featuring country music and humor with the fictional rural "Kornfield Kounty" as a backdrop.  It aired on CBS from 1969 to 1971, in syndication from 1971 to 1993, and on TNN from 1996 to 1997.  The show was inspired by Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In,  the major difference being that Hee Haw was far less topical, and was centered on country music and rural culture.  Hosted by country music artists Buck Owens and Roy Clark for most of its run, the show was equally well known for its voluptuous, scantily clad women in stereotypical farmer's daughter outfits and country-style minidresses (a group that came to be known as the "Hee Haw Honeys"), and its corn pone humor. 

Hexadecimal<====>13263<====>Hexadecimal In mathematics and computing, hexadecimal (also base  , or hex) is a positional numeral system with a radix, or base, of 16.  It uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols 0–9 to represent values zero to nine, and A, B, C, D, E, F (or alternatively a, b, c, d, e, f) to represent values ten to fifteen.  Hexadecimal numerals are widely used by computer system designers and programmers.  As each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits (bits), it allows a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values.  One hexadecimal digit represents a nibble (4 bits), which is half of an octet or byte (8 bits). 

Histogram<====>13266<====>Histogram  A histogram is an accurate representation of the distribution of numerical data.  It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable (quantitative variable) and was first introduced by Karl Pearson.It is a kind of bar graph.  To construct a histogram, the first step is to "bin" the range of values—that is, divide the entire range of values into a series of intervals—and then count how many values fall into each interval.

Historiography<====>13276<====>HistoriographyHistoriography is the study of the methods of historians in developing history as an academic discipline, and by extension is any body of historical work on a particular subject.  The historiography of a specific topic covers how historians have studied that topic using particular sources, techniques, and theoretical approaches.  Scholars discuss historiography by topic – such as the "historiography of the United Kingdom", the "historiography of Canada", "historiography of the British Empire", the "historiography of early Islam", the "historiography of China" – and different approaches and genres, such as political history and social history.  Beginning in the nineteenth century, with the ascent of academic history, there developed a body of historiographic literature.

Holland<====>13288<====>Holland   Holland is a region and former province on the western coast of the Netherlands.  The name Holland is also frequently used informally to refer to the whole of the country of the Netherlands.  This usage is commonly accepted in other countries, and not entirely uncommon among the Dutch themselves.   However, some in the Netherlands, particularly in other regions of the country, may find it undesirable    or misrepresentative.

History of the Netherlands<====>13289<====>History of the Netherlands  The history of the Netherlands is the history of seafaring people thriving on a lowland river delta on the North Sea in northwestern Europe.  Records begin with the four centuries during which the region formed a militarized border zone of the Roman empire.  This came under increasing pressure from Germanic peoples moving westwards.  As Roman power collapsed and the Middle Ages began, three dominant Germanic peoples coalesced in the area, Frisians in the north and coastal areas, Low Saxons in the northeast, and the Franks in the south. During the Middle Ages, the descendants of the Carolingian dynasty came to dominate the area and then extended their rule to a large part of Western Europe.

Habitus (sociology)<====>13291<====>Habitus (sociology) Habitus is a system of embodied dispositions, tendencies that organize the ways in which individuals perceive the social world around them and react to it.  These dispositions are usually shared by people with similar background  (in terms of social class, religion, nationality, ethnicity, education, profession etc. ), as the habitus is acquired through mimesis    and reflects the lived reality to which individuals are socialized, their individual experience and objective opportunities.  Thus, the habitus represents the way group culture and personal history shape the body and the mind, and as a result, shape social action in the present. 

Hypoxia (medical)<====>13292<====>Hypoxia (medical) Hypoxia is a condition in which the body or a region of the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply at the tissue level.  Hypoxia may be classified as either generalized, affecting the whole body, or local, affecting a region of the body.  Although hypoxia is often a pathological condition, variations in arterial oxygen concentrations can be part of the normal physiology, for example, during hypoventilation training  or strenuous physical exercise. Hypoxia differs from hypoxemia and anoxemia in that hypoxia refers to a state in which oxygen supply is insufficient, whereas hypoxemia and anoxemia refer specifically to states that have low or zero arterial oxygen supply. 

Historical revisionism<====>13293<====>Historical revisionism In historiography, the term historical revisionism identifies the re-interpretation of the historical record.  It usually means challenging the   views  held by professional scholars about a historical event, or introducing new evidence, or of restating the motivations and decisions of the participant people.  The revision of the historical record reflects the new discoveries of fact, evidence, and interpretation, which produce a revised history.   In dramatic cases, revisionism involves a reversal of older moral judgments about heroes and villains. At a basic level, historical revisionism is a common and not especially controversial process of developing and refining the writing of history.

Hoplite<====>13298<====>Hoplite Hoplites were citizen-soldiers of Ancient Greek city-states who were primarily armed with spears and shields.  Hoplite soldiers utilized the phalanx formation in order to be effective in war with fewer soldiers.  The formation discouraged the soldiers from acting alone, for this would compromise the formation and minimize its strengths.   The hoplites were primarily represented by free citizens—propertied farmers and artisans—who were able to afford the bronze armour suit and weapons (estimated at a third to a half of its able-bodied adult male population). Hoplites were not professional soldiers and often lacked sufficient military training. 

History of Spain<====>13299<====>History of Spain The history of Spain dates back to the Early Middle Ages.

Hormone<====>13311<====>Hormone A hormone (from the Greek participle “ ”, "to set in motion, urge on") is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by  glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour.   Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and amino acid/protein derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins).  The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system.  The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling). 

Hammond organ<====>13312<====>Hammond organ   The Hammond organ is an electric organ, invented by Laurens Hammond and John M.  Hanert  and first manufactured in 1935.   Various models have been produced, most of which use sliding drawbars to specify a variety of sounds.  Until 1975, Hammond organs generated sound by creating an electric current from rotating a metal tonewheel near an electromagnetic pickup, and then strengthening the signal with an amplifier so it can drive a speaker cabinet.  Around two million Hammond organs have been manufactured.  The organ is commonly used with, and associated with, the Leslie speaker. 

Hypoglycemia<====>13315<====>Hypoglycemia  Hypoglycemia, also known as low blood sugar, is when blood sugar decreases to below normal levels.

Holmium<====>13465<====>Holmium Holmium is a chemical element with symbol Ho and atomic number 67.  Part of the lanthanide series, holmium is a rare-earth element.  Holmium was discovered by Swedish chemist Per Theodor Cleve.  Its oxide was first isolated from rare-earth ores in 1878.  The element's name comes from Holmia, the Latin name for the city of Stockholm. Elemental holmium is a relatively soft and malleable silvery-white metal.  It is too reactive to be found uncombined in nature, but when isolated, is relatively stable in dry air at room temperature.  However, it reacts with water and corrodes readily and also burns in air when heated. 

Hafnium<====>13466<====>Hafnium Hafnium is a chemical element with symbol Hf and atomic number 72.  A lustrous, silvery gray, tetravalent transition metal, hafnium chemically resembles zirconium and is found in many zirconium minerals.  Its existence was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, though it was not identified until 1923, by Coster and Hevesy, making it the last stable element to be discovered.  Hafnium is named after Hafnia, the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered.Hafnium is used in filaments and electrodes.   Some semiconductor fabrication processes use its oxide for integrated circuits at 45 nm and smaller feature lengths.

Horseshoe<====>13480<====>Horseshoe   A horseshoe is a fabricated product, normally made of metal, although sometimes made partially or wholly of modern synthetic materials, designed to protect a horse's hoof from wear.  Shoes are attached on the palmar surface (ground side) of the hooves, usually nailed through the insensitive hoof wall that is anatomically akin to the human toenail, although much larger and thicker.  However, there are also cases where shoes are glued.

Hemoglobin<====>13483<====>Hemoglobin Hemoglobin (American) or haemoglobin (British) (    ); abbreviated Hb or Hgb, is the iron-containing oxygen-transport metalloprotein in the red blood cells of all vertebrates  (with the exception of the fish family Channichthyidae   ) as well as the tissues of some invertebrates.  Hemoglobin in the blood carries oxygen from the respiratory organs (lungs or gills) to the rest of the body (i. e.  the tissues).   There it releases the oxygen to permit aerobic respiration to provide energy to power the functions of the organism in the process called metabolism. In mammals, the protein makes up about 96% of the red blood cells' dry content (by weight), and around 35% of the total content (including water).

He is sometimes referred to as the "Father of Medicine"   in recognition of his lasting contributions to the field as the founder of the Hippocratic School of Medicine.  This intellectual school revolutionized medicine in ancient Greece, establishing it as a discipline distinct from other fields with which it had traditionally been associated (theurgy and philosophy), thus establishing medicine as a profession.

Marrubium vulgare<====>13490<====>Marrubium vulgare  Marrubium vulgare (white horehound or common horehound) is a flowering plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae), native to Europe, northern Africa, and southwestern and central Asia.  It is also widely naturalized in many places, including most of North and South America. It is a grey-leaved herbaceous perennial plant, and grows to   tall.  The leaves are   long with a densely crinkled surface, and are covered in downy hairs.  The flowers are white, borne in clusters on the upper part of the main stem. EtymologyThe Oxford English Dictionary derives the word from two Old English forms: "hoar" ("white," "light-colored," as in "hoarfrost") and "hune" a word of unknown origin designating a class of herbs or plants. 

Hyperthyroidism<====>13492<====>Hyperthyroidism   Hyperthyroidism is the condition that occurs due to excessive production of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland.   Thyrotoxicosis is the condition that occurs due to excessive thyroid hormone of any cause and therefore includes hyperthyroidism.Some, however, use the terms interchangeably.   Signs and symptoms vary between people and may include irritability, muscle weakness, sleeping problems, a fast heartbeat, heat intolerance, diarrhea, enlargement of the thyroid, and weight loss.   Symptoms are typically less in the old and during pregnancy.   An uncommon complication is thyroid storm in which an event such as an infection results in worsening symptoms such as confusion and a high temperature and often results in death. 

Transclusion<====>13499<====>Transclusion  In computer science, transclusion is the inclusion of part or all of an electronic document into one or more other documents by hypertext reference.   Transclusion is usually performed when the referencing document is displayed, and is normally automatic and transparent to the end user.    The result of transclusion is a single integrated document made of parts assembled on the fly from separate sources, possibly stored on different computers in disparate places. Transclusion facilitates modular design: a resource  is stored once and distributed for reuse in multiple documents.  Updates or corrections to a resource are then reflected in any referencing documents. 

Source tracking<====>13501<====>Source tracking  Source tracking pertains to the ability of some hypertext systems to rigorously track the exact source of every document or partial document included in the system; that is, they remember who entered the information, when it was entered, when it was updated and by whom, and so on.  This allows determining the exact history of every document (and even small parts of documents). Present HTML and HTTP do not have this feature, but certain systems on the World Wide Web (such as WikiWiki and Everything Engine) may have limited versions of the capability. One application of digital watermarking is source tracking.

Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island, where he spent most of his life.  Among his most celebrated tales are "The Rats in the Walls", "The Call of Cthulhu", At the Mountains of Madness and The Shadow Out of Time, all canonical to the Cthulhu Mythos. 

Huns<====>13519<====>Huns    The Huns were a nomadic people who lived in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia between the 4th century AD and the 6th century AD.  According to European tradition, they were first reported living east of the Volga River, in an area that was part of Scythia at the time; the Huns' arrival is associated with the migration westward of a Scythian people, the Alans.By 370 AD, the Huns had arrived on the Volga, and by 430 the Huns had established a vast, if short-lived, dominion in Europe. In the 18th century, the French scholar Joseph de Guignes became the first to propose a link between the Huns and the Xiongnu people, who were northern neighbours of China in the 3rd century BC.

Roman Britain<====>13525<====>Roman BritainRoman Britain (  or, later,  , "the Britains") was the area of the island of Great Britain that was governed by the Roman Empire, from 43 to 410 AD.   Julius Caesar invaded Britain in 55 and 54 BC as part of his Gallic Wars.    The Britons had been overrun or culturally assimilated by other Celtic tribes during the British Iron Age and had been aiding Caesar's enemies.  He received tribute, installed a friendly king over the Trinovantes, and returned to Gaul.  Planned invasions under Augustus were called off in 34, 27, and 25 BC. 

List of Roman place names in Britain<====>13526<====>List of Roman place names in BritainA partial list of Roman place names in Great Britain. This list includes only names documented from Roman times.  For a more complete list including later Latin names, see List of Latin place names in Britain. The early sources for Roman names show numerous variants and misspellings of the Latin names.  Moreover, one of the principal authorities, Ptolemy, wrote in Greek so names that he records need to be transliterated back into Latin to reveal the original form.  Note that in general only one source is shown below for each name, although many of the names are recorded in more than one of the sources. 

Hemiparesis<====>13528<====>Hemiparesis  Hemiparesis, or unilateral paresis, is weakness of one entire side of the body (  means "half").  Hemiplegia is, in its most severe form, complete paralysis of half of the body.   Hemiparesis and hemiplegia can be caused by different medical conditions, including congenital causes, trauma, tumors, or stroke.  Detailed article about hemiparesis at Disabled-World. com Signs and symptomsDepending on the type of hemiparesis diagnosed, different bodily functions can be affected.   Some effects are expected (e. g. , partial paralysis of a limb on the affected side).  Other impairments, though, can at first seem completely non-related to the limb weakness but are, in fact, a direct result of the damage to the affected side of the brain. 

Henri Bergson<====>13531<====>Henri Bergson   Henri-Louis Bergson ( ; 18 October 1859 – 4 January 1941) was a French philosopher, influential especially in the first half of the 20th century and after WWII in continental philosophy.  Bergson is known for his influential arguments that processes of immediate experience and intuition are more significant than abstract rationalism and science for understanding reality. He was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Literature "in recognition of his rich and vitalizing ideas and the brilliant skill with which they have been presented".In 1930 France awarded him its highest honour, the Grand-Croix de la Legion d'honneur. 

Hans Selye<====>13532<====>Hans Selye János Hugo Bruno "Hans" Selye, CC ( ;  ; January 26, 1907 – October 16, 1982), was a pioneering Hungarian-Canadian endocrinologist of Hungarian origin.  He conducted much important scientific work on the hypothetical non-specific response of an organism to stressors.  Although he did not recognize all of the many aspects of glucocorticoids, Selye was aware of their role in the stress response.  Charlotte Gerson  considers him the first to demonstrate the existence of biological stress. BiographySelye was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary on 26 January 1907.   He grew up in Komárno, Slovakia, and the Selye János University a Hungarian language university in that town bears his name. 

Hacker<====>13533<====>Hacker    In computing, a hacker is any skilled computer expert that uses their technical knowledge to overcome a problem.  While "hacker" can refer to any skilled computer programmer, the term has become associated in popular culture with a "security hacker", someone who, with their technical knowledge, uses bugs or exploits to break into computer systems. TypesHacker culture Hacker culture is an idea derived from a community of enthusiast computer programmers and systems designers in the 1960s around the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT's) Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC)  and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.   The concept expanded to the hobbyist home computing community, focusing on hardware in the late 1970s (e. 

Heart of Darkness<====>13535<====>Heart of Darkness    Heart of Darkness (1899) is a novella by Polish-British novelist Joseph Conrad, about a voyage up the Congo River into the Congo Free State, in the heart of Africa, by the story's narrator Charles Marlow.   Marlow tells his story to friends aboard a boat anchored on the River Thames, London, England.  This setting provides the frame for Marlow's story of his obsession with the ivory trader Kurtz, which enables Conrad to create a parallel between London and Africa as places of darkness.  Central to Conrad's work is the idea that there is little difference between so-called civilised people and those described as savages; Heart of Darkness raises questions about imperialism and racism. 

Hinduism<====>13543<====>HinduismHinduism is an Indian Dharma, or a way of life,  widely practiced in South Asia.  Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world,  and some practitioners and scholars refer to it as  , "the eternal tradition," or the "eternal way," beyond human history.    Scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion  or synthesis   of various Indian cultures and traditions,  ;  ;with diverse roots   and no founder.   This "Hindu synthesis" started to develop between 500 BCE and 300 CE,  following the Vedic period (1500 BCE to 500 BCE).

Herman Brood<====>13563<====>Herman Brood  Hermanus "Herman" Brood  ( ; 5 November 1946 – 11 July 2001) was a Dutch musician and painter.  As a musician he achieved artistic and commercial success in the 1970s and 1980s, and was called "the greatest and only Dutch rock 'n' roll star".Later in life he started a successful career as a painter. Known for his hedonistic lifestyle of "sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll", Brood was an enfant terrible and a cultural figure whose suicide by jumping from a hotel roof, apparently influenced by a failure to kick his drug and alcohol habit,  strengthened his controversial status; according to a poll organized to celebrate fifty years of Dutch popular music, it was the most significant event in its history. 

Homomorphism<====>13564<====>Homomorphism In algebra, a homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type (such as two groups, two rings, or two vector spaces).  The word homomorphism comes from the ancient Greek language:   (homos) meaning "same" and   (morphe) meaning "form" or "shape".  However, the word was apparently introduced to mathematics due to a (mis)translation of German   meaning "similar" to ὁμός meaning "same".  Homomorphisms of vector spaces are also called linear maps, and their study is the object of linear algebra. The concept of homomorphism has been generalized, under the name of morphism, to many other structures that either do not have an underlying set, or are not algebraic. 

HyperCard<====>13567<====>HyperCard  HyperCard is application software and a programming tool for Apple Macintosh and Apple IIGS computers.  It is among the first successful hypermedia systems before the World Wide Web. It combines database abilities with a graphical, flexible, user-modifiable interface.HyperCard also features HyperTalk, a programming language for manipulating data and the user interface. This combination of features – simple form layout, database abilities, and ease of programming – led to widespread use in many different roles.  Some HyperCard users employed it as a programming system for rapid application development of applications and databases, others for building interactive applications with no database requirements, command and control systems, and many examples in the demoscene. 

Histology<====>13570<====>Histology  Histology  is the study of the microscopic anatomy (microanatomy) of cells and tissues of plants and animals.  It is commonly performed by examining cells and tissues under a light microscope or electron microscope, the specimen having been sectioned (cut into a thin cross section with a microtome), stained, and mounted on a microscope slide.  Histological studies may be conducted using tissue culture, where live human or animal cells are isolated and maintained in an artificial environment for various research projects.  The ability to visualize or differentially identify microscopic structures is frequently enhanced through the use of histological stains.

He is often referred to as "The Father of History", a title first conferred by Cicero;  he was the first historian known to have broken from Homeric tradition to treat historical subjects as a method of investigation—specifically, by collecting his materials systematically and critically, and then arranging them into a historiographic narrative.   The Histories is the only work which he is known to have produced, a record of his "inquiry" (  historía) on the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars; it primarily deals with the lives of Croesus, Cyrus, Cambyses, Smerdis, Darius, and Xerxes and the battles of Marathon, Thermopylae, Artemisium, Salamis, Plataea, and Mycale; however, its many cultural, ethnographical, geographical, historiographical, and other digressions form a defining and essential part of the Histories and contain a wealth of information. 

Historian<====>13575<====>Historian A historian is a person who researches, studies, and writes about the past, and is regarded as an authority on it.Historians are concerned with the continuous, methodical narrative and research of past events as relating to the human race; as well as the study of all history in time.  If the individual is concerned with events preceding written history, the individual is an historian of prehistory.  Although "historian" can be used to describe amateur and professional historians alike, it is reserved more recently for those who have acquired graduate degrees in the  discipline.

History of the Mediterranean region<====>13584<====>History of the Mediterranean regionThe Mediterranean Sea was the central superhighway of transport, trade and cultural exchange between diverse peoples encompassing three continents: Western Asia, North Africa, and Southern Europe.  The history of the cultures and people of the Mediterranean Basin is important for understanding the origin and development of the Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Canaanite, Phoenician, Hebrew, Carthaginian, Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Ottoman, Christian and Islamic cultures. Early history  There is evidence of stone tools on Crete, 130,000 years BCE,   which proves that early humans were capable of using boats on the seas to reach the island. 

Hugo de Garis<====>13585<====>Hugo de Garis  Hugo de Garis (born 1947, Sydney, Australia) is a retired researcher in the sub-field of artificial intelligence (AI) known as evolvable hardware.  He became known in the 1990s for his research on the use of genetic algorithms to evolve neural networks using three-dimensional cellular automata inside field programmable gate arrays.  He  claimed that this approach would enable the creation of what he terms "artificial brains" which would quickly surpass human levels of intelligence.    He has more recently been noted for his belief that a major war between the supporters and opponents of intelligent machines, resulting in billions of deaths, is almost inevitable before the end of the 21st century. 

HTTPS<====>13586<====>HTTPSHTTPS (HTTP Secure) is an adaptation of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet.   In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted by Transport Layer Security (TLS), or formerly, its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).  The protocol is therefore also often referred to as HTTP over TLS,    or HTTP over SSL.    The principal motivation for HTTPS is authentication of the accessed website and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data.  It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks. 

History of Egypt<====>13588<====>History of Egypt    The history of Egypt has been long and rich, due to the flow of the Nile river, with its fertile banks and delta.  Its rich history also comes from its native inhabitants and outside influence.  Much of Egypt's ancient history was a mystery until the secrets of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs were deciphered with the discovery and help of the Rosetta Stone.  The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.  The Lighthouse of Alexandria, one of the other Seven Wonders, is gone. 

House<====>13590<====>House   A house is a building that functions as a home, ranging from simple dwellings such as rudimentary huts  of nomadic tribes and the improvised shacks in shantytowns to complex, fixed structures of wood, brick, concrete or other materials containing plumbing, ventilation and electrical systems.  Schoenauer, Norbert (2000).  6,000 Years of Housing (rev.  ed. ) (New York: W. W.  Norton & Company).

Typical heteroatoms are nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus, chlorine, bromine, and iodine.   In the description of protein structure, in particular in the Protein Data Bank file format, a heteroatom record (HETATM) describes an atom as belonging to a small molecule cofactor rather than being part of a biopolymer chain.    In the context of zeolites, the term heteroatom refers to partial isomorphous substitution of the typical framework atoms (silicon, aluminium, and phosphorus) by other elements such as beryllium, vanadium, and chromium.

Humus<====>13607<====>Humus    In soil science, humus (coined 1790–1800; from the Latin humus: earth, ground ) refers to the fraction of soil organic matter that is amorphous and without the "cellular cake structure characteristic of plants, micro-organisms or animals. "    Humus significantly influences the bulk density of soil and contributes to moisture and nutrient retention. Soil formation begins with the weathering of humus. In agriculture, humus is sometimes also used to describe mature, or natural compost extracted from a forest or other spontaneous source for use to amend soil.   It is also used to describe a topsoil horizon that contains organic matter (humus type,  humus form,  humus profile). 

Hydrogen bond<====>13609<====>Hydrogen bondA hydrogen bond is an electrostatic attraction between two polar groups that occurs when a hydrogen (H) atom, covalently bound to a highly electronegative atom such as nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), or fluorine (F), experiences the electrostatic field of another highly electronegative atom nearby. Hydrogen bonds can occur between molecules (intermolecular) or within different parts of a single molecule (intramolecular).   Depending on the nature of the donor and acceptor atoms which constitute the bond, their geometry, and environment, the energy of a hydrogen bond can vary between 1 and 40 kcal/mol.   This makes them somewhat stronger than a van der Waals interaction, and weaker than covalent or ionic bonds. 

Heraldry<====>13610<====>HeraldryHeraldry ( ) is a broad term, encompassing the design, display, and study of armorial bearings (known as armory), as well as related disciplines, such as vexillology, together with the study of ceremony, rank, and pedigree. Armory is the most familiar branch of heraldry, concerning the design and transmission of the heraldic achievement, more commonly known as the coat of arms.  The coat of arms usually includes a shield, helmet, and crest, together with any accompanying devices, such as supporters, badges, heraldic banners, and mottoes.  Although the use of various devices to signify individuals and groups goes back to antiquity, both the form and use of such devices varied widely, and the concept of regular, hereditary designs, constituting the distinguishing feature of heraldry, did not develop until the High Middle Ages. 

Heretic (video game)<====>13611<====>Heretic (video game)  Heretic is a dark fantasy first-person shooter video game released in 1994.  It was developed by Raven Software and published by id Software through GT Interactive.  The game was released on Steam on August 3, 2007.  Using a modified version of the Doom engine, Heretic was one of the first first-person games to feature inventory manipulation and the ability to look up and down.  It also introduced multiple gib objects that spawned when a character suffered a death by extreme force or heat.  Previously, the character would simply crumple into a heap. 

Hexen: Beyond Heretic<====>13612<====>Hexen: Beyond Heretic  Hexen: Beyond Heretic is a dark fantasy first-person shooter video game developed by Raven Software and published by id Software through GT Interactive Software on October 30, 1995.  It is the sequel to 1994's Heretic, and the second game in Raven Software's "Serpent Riders" series.  The title comes from the German noun Hexen, which means "witches", and/or the verb hexen, which means "to cast a spell".  Game producer John Romero stated that a third game in this series which was never released was to be called Hecatomb.  PlotFollowing the tale of D'Sparil's defeat in Heretic, Hexen takes place in another realm, Cronos, which is besieged by the second of the three Serpent Riders, Korax. 

Hexen II<====>13613<====>Hexen II Hexen II is a dark fantasy first-person shooter video game developed by Raven Software from 1996 to 1997, published by id Software and distributed by Activision.  It was the third game in the Hexen/Heretic series, and the last in the Serpent Riders trilogy.  It was made available on Steam on August 3, 2007.   Using a modified Quake engine, it featured single-player and multiplayer game modes, as well as four character classes to choose from, each with different abilities.  These included the offensive Paladin, the defensive Crusader, the spell-casting Necromancer, and the stealthy Assassin. 

Heretic II<====>13614<====>Heretic II Heretic II is a dark fantasy action-adventure game developed by Raven Software and published by Activision in 1998 continuing the story of Corvus, the main character from its predecessor, Heretic. Using a modified Quake II engine, the game features a mix of a third-person camera with a first-person shooter's action, making for a new gaming experience at the time.  While progressive, this was a controversial design decision among fans of the original title,  a well-known first-person shooter built on the Doom engine.  The music was composed by Kevin Schilder.  Gerald Brom contributed conceptual work to characters and creatures for the game.

Howard Carter<====>13616<====>Howard CarterHoward Carter (9 May 1874 2 March 1939) was a British archaeologist and Egyptologist who became world-famous after discovering the intact tomb (designated KV62) of the 18th Dynasty Pharaoh, Tutankhamun (colloquially known as "King Tut" and "the boy king"), in November 1922. Early lifeHoward Carter was born in Kensington on 9 May 1874, the son of Samuel John Carter, an artist, and Martha Joyce Carter (née Sands).  His father trained and developed Howard's artistic talents. Carter spent much of his childhood with relatives in the Norfolk market town of Swaffham, the birthplace of both his parents. 

History of Scotland<====>13617<====>History of Scotland   The   is known to have begun by the end of the last glacial period (in the paleolithic), roughly 10,000 years ago.  Prehistoric Scotland entered the Neolithic Era about 4000 BC, the Bronze Age about 2000 BC, and the Iron Age around 700 BC.  Scotland's recorded history began with the arrival of the Roman Empire in the 1st century, when the province of Britannia reached as far north as the line between the firths of Clyde to the Forth.  North of this was Caledonia, whose people were known in Latin as "Picti", "the painted ones". 

Hadrian<====>13621<====>HadrianHadrian ( ;  ; In Classical Latin, Hadrian's name would be inscribed as PVBLIVS AELIVS HADRIANVS AVGVSTVS.   As emperor his name was Imperator Caesar Divi Traiani filius Traianus Hadrianus Augustus.   24 January 76 – 10 July 138) was Roman emperor from 117 to 138.  He is known for building Hadrian's Wall, which marked the northern limit of Britannia.  He also rebuilt the Pantheon, constructed the Temple of Venus and Roma, and may have rebuilt the Serapeum of Alexandria.  Philhellene in most of his tastes, he is considered by some to have been a humanist. 

Herman Melville<====>13623<====>Herman Melville Herman Melville  (August 1, 1819 – September 28, 1891) was an American novelist, short story writer, and poet of the American Renaissance period.  His best known works include Typee (1846), a romantic account of his experiences in Polynesian life, and his whaling novel Moby-Dick (1851).  His work was almost forgotten during his last 30 years.  His writing draws on his experience at sea as a common sailor, exploration of literature and philosophy, and engagement in the contradictions of American society in a period of rapid change.  He developed a complex, baroque  style; the vocabulary is rich and original, a strong sense of rhythm infuses the elaborate sentences, the imagery is often mystical or ironic, and the abundance of allusion extends to biblical scripture, myth, philosophy, literature, and the visual arts. 

High fidelity<====>13624<====>High fidelity  High fidelity (often shortened to hi-fi or hifi) reproduction is a term used by home stereo listeners, audiophiles and home audio enthusiasts to refer to high-quality reproduction of sound  to distinguish it from the lower quality sound produced by inexpensive audio equipment, or the inferior quality of sound reproduction that can be heard in recordings made until the late 1940s. Ideally, high-fidelity equipment has inaudible noise and distortion, and a flat (neutral, uncolored) frequency response within the intended frequency range.  HistoryBell Laboratories began experimenting with a range of recording techniques in the early 1930s.   Performances by Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra were recorded in 1931 and 1932 using telephone lines between the Academy of Music in Philadelphia and the Bell labs in New Jersey. 

Holden<====>13625<====>Holden    Holden, formally known as General Motors Holden, is an Australian automobile importer and a former automobile manufacturer with its headquarters in Port Melbourne, Victoria.  The company was founded in 1856 as a saddlery manufacturer in South Australia.  In 1908 it moved into the automotive field, becoming a subsidiary of the United States-based General Motors (GM) in 1931, when the company was renamed General Motors-Holden's Ltd.  It was renamed Holden Ltd in 1998, and General Motors Holden in 2005. Holden sells the remaining stock of the locally produced range of Commodore vehicles, and imported GM models. 

Hank Greenberg<====>13627<====>Hank Greenberg   Henry Benjamin "Hank" Greenberg (born Hyman Greenberg; January 1, 1911 – September 4, 1986), nicknamed "Hammerin' Hank", "Hankus Pankus", or "The Hebrew Hammer", was an American professional baseball player and team executive.  He played in Major League Baseball (MLB), primarily for the Detroit Tigers as a first baseman in the 1930s and 1940s.   A member of the Baseball Hall of Fame and a two-time MVP winner, he was one of the premier power hitters of his generation and is widely considered as one of the greatest sluggers in baseball history.   He had 47 months of military service including service in World War II, all of which took place during his major league career. 

Heinrich Schliemann<====>13628<====>Heinrich Schliemann  Heinrich Schliemann ( ; 6 January 1822 – 26 December 1890) was a German businessman and a pioneer in the field of archaeology.  He was an advocate of the historicity of places mentioned in the works of Homer and an archaeological excavator of Hissarlik, now presumed to be the site of Troy, along with the Mycenaean sites Mycenae and Tiryns.  His work lent weight to the idea that Homer's Iliad and Virgil's Aeneid reflect historical events.  Schliemann's excavation of nine levels of archaeological remains with dynamite has been criticized as destructive of significant historical artifacts, including the level that is believed to be the historical Troy. 

Hypnos<====>13629<====>Hypnos   In Greek mythology, Hypnos ( ;  , "sleep")  is the personification of sleep; the Roman equivalent is known as Somnus.  DescriptionIn the Greek mythology, Hypnos is the son of Nyx ("The Night") and Erebus ("The Darkness").  His brother is Thanatos ("Death").  Both siblings live in the underworld  (Hades) or in Erebus, another valley of the Greek underworld.  According to rumors, Hypnos lives in a big cave, which the river Lethe ("Forgetfulness") comes from and where night and day meet.  His bed is made of ebony, on the entrance of the cave grow a number of poppies and other hypnotic plants. 

Holy orders<====>13631<====>Holy ordersIn the Christian churches, Holy Orders are ordained ministries such as bishop, priest or deacon.  In the Roman Catholic (Latin: sacri ordines), Eastern Catholic, Eastern Orthodox (ιερωσύνη [hierōsynē], ιεράτευμα [hierateuma], Священство [Svyashchenstvo]), Oriental Orthodox, Anglican, Assyrian, Old Catholic, Independent Catholic and some Lutheran churches, holy orders are  the three ministerial orders of bishop, priest and deacon , or the sacrament or rite by which candidates are ordained to those orders.  Except for Lutherans and some Anglicans, these churches regard ordination as a sacrament (the sacramentum ordinis).  The Anglo-Catholic tradition within Anglicanism identifies more with the Roman Catholic position about the sacramental nature of ordination. 

Homer<====>13633<====>Homer    Homer (   , Hómēros) is the name ascribed by the ancient Greeks to the legendary author of the Iliad and the Odyssey, two epic poems which are the central works of ancient Greek literature.  The Iliad is set during the Trojan War, the ten-year siege of the city of Troy by a coalition of Greek states.  It focuses on a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles lasting a few weeks during the last year of the war.  The Odyssey focuses on the journey home of Odysseus, king of Ithaca, after the fall of Troy. 

Hugo Gernsback<====>13635<====>Hugo Gernsback Hugo Gernsback (born Hugo Gernsbacher, August 16, 1884 – August 19, 1967) was a Luxembourgish-American inventor, writer, editor, and magazine publisher, best known for publications including the first science fiction magazine.  His contributions to the genre as publisher–although not as a writer–were so significant that, along with the novelists H.  G.  Wells and Jules Verne, he is sometimes called "The Father of Science Fiction".   In his honour, annual awards presented at the World Science Fiction Convention are named the "Hugos".  Personal lifeGernsback was born in 1884 in Bonnevoie in Luxembourg, to Berta (Dürlacher), a housewife, and Moritz Gernsbacher, a winemaker. 

History of computing hardware<====>13636<====>History of computing hardware The history of computing hardware covers the developments from early simple devices to aid calculation to modern day computers.  Before the 20th century, most calculations were done by humans.  Early mechanical tools to help humans with digital calculations, such as the abacus, were called "calculating machines", by proprietary names, or even as they are now, calculators.  The machine operator was called the computer. The first aids to computation were purely mechanical devices which required the operator to set up the initial values of an elementary arithmetic operation, then manipulate the device to obtain the result. 

Hausdorff space<====>13637<====>Hausdorff space In topology and related branches of mathematics, a Hausdorff space, separated space or T 2  space is a topological space in which distinct points have disjoint neighbourhoods.  Of the many separation axioms that can be imposed on a topological space, the "Hausdorff condition" (T 2 ) is the most frequently used and discussed.  It implies the uniqueness of limits of sequences, nets, and filters. Hausdorff spaces are named after Felix Hausdorff, one of the founders of topology.  Hausdorff's original definition of a topological space (in 1914) included the Hausdorff condition as an axiom. DefinitionsPoints x and y in a topological space X can be separated by neighbourhoods if there exists a neighbourhood U of x and a neighbourhood V of y such that U and V are disjoint ( ). 

Hawkwind<====>13644<====>Hawkwind   Hawkwind  are  an English rock band and one of the earliest space rock groups.  Their lyrics favour urban and science fiction themes.  Formed in November 1969, Hawkwind have gone through many incarnations and they have incorporated different styles into their music, including hard rock, progressive rock and psychedelic rock.  They are also regarded as an influential proto-punk band.    Dozens of musicians, dancers and writers have worked with the band since their inception.  Notable musicians to have performed in the band include Lemmy, Ginger Baker and Huw Lloyd-Langton, but the band are most closely associated with their founder, the singer, songwriter and guitarist Dave Brock, who remains the only original member. 

Horse<====>13645<====>Horse   The horse (Equus ferus caballus)is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus.  It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae.  The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today.  Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC.  Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses.  These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. 

Hermann Ebbinghaus<====>13647<====>Hermann Ebbinghaus Hermann Ebbinghaus (January 24, 1850 – February 26, 1909) was a German psychologist who pioneered the experimental study of memory, and is known for his discovery of the forgetting curve and the spacing effect.  He was also the first person to describe the learning curve.  He was the father of the eminent neo-Kantian philosopher Julius Ebbinghaus. Early lifeEbbinghaus was born in Barmen, in the Rhine Province of the Kingdom of Prussia, as the son of a wealthy merchant, Carl Ebbinghaus.  Little is known about his infancy except that he was brought up in the Lutheran faith and was a pupil at the town Gymnasium. 

Hindi<====>13652<====>Hindi Hindi (Devanagari:  ,   IAST:   Hindī), or Modern Standard Hindi (Devanagari: मानक हिन्दी,   IAST:   Mānak Hindī) is a standardised and Sanskritised register    of the Hindustani language.  The modern Hindi and its literary tradition evolved towards the end of the 18th century.   Along with the English language, Hindi written in the Devanagari script is one of the 22 official languages of the Government of India.On 14 September 1949, the Constituent Assembly of India adopted Hindi written in Devanagari script as the official language of the Republic of India. 

Huginn and Muninn<====>13653<====>Huginn and MuninnIn Norse mythology, Huginn (from Old Norse "thought" Orchard (1997:92).  ) and Muninn (Old Norse "memory" Orchard (1997:115).   or "mind" Lindow (2001:186).  ) are a pair of ravens that fly all over the world, Midgard, and bring information to the god Odin.  Huginn and Muninn are attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources: the Prose Edda and Heimskringla, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; in the Third Grammatical Treatise, compiled in the 13th century by Óláfr Þórðarson; and in the poetry of skalds.  The names of the ravens are sometimes modernly anglicized as Hugin and Munin. 

Heat engine<====>13654<====>Heat engine   In thermodynamics, a heat engine is a system that converts heat or thermal energy—and chemical energy—to mechanical energy, which can then be used to do mechanical work.    It does this by bringing a working substance from a higher state temperature to a lower state temperature.  A heat source generates thermal energy that brings the working substance to the high temperature state.  The working substance generates work in the working body of the engine while transferring heat to the colder sink until it reaches a low temperature state.  During this process some of the thermal energy is converted into work by exploiting the properties of the working substance. 

Heimdallr<====>13655<====>Heimdallr In Norse mythology, Heimdallr is a god who possesses the resounding horn Gjallarhorn, owns the golden-maned horse Gulltoppr, has gold teeth, and is the son of Nine Mothers, grandson of Aegir and great grandson of Fornjotr.  Heimdallr is attested as possessing foreknowledge, keen eyesight and hearing, and keeps watch for the onset of Ragnarök while drinking fine mead in his dwelling Himinbjörg, located where the burning rainbow bridge Bifröst meets heaven.  Heimdallr is said to be the originator of social classes among humanity and once regained Freyja's treasured possession Brísingamen while doing battle in the shape of a seal with Loki. 

House of Lords<====>13658<====>House of Lords  The House of Lords of the United Kingdom, also known as the House of Peers, is the upper house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  Like the House of Commons, it meets in the Palace of Westminster.   Officially, the full name of the house is the Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled. Unlike the elected House of Commons, all members of the House of Lords (excluding 90 hereditary peers elected among themselves and two peers who are ex officio members) are appointed. 

Homeomorphism<====>13660<====>Homeomorphism   In the mathematical field of topology, a homeomorphism or topological isomorphism or bi continuous function is a continuous function between topological spaces that has a continuous inverse function.  Homeomorphisms are the isomorphisms in the category of topological spaces—that is, they are the mappings that preserve all the topological properties of a given space.  Two spaces with a homeomorphism between them are called homeomorphic, and from a topological viewpoint they are the same.  The word homeomorphism comes from the Greek words   (homoios) = similar or same (French pareil) and   (morphē) = shape, form, introduced to mathematics by Poincare in 1895. 

Hvergelmir<====>13661<====>HvergelmirIn Norse mythology, Hvergelmir (Old Norse "bubbling boiling spring" Orchard (1997:93) ) is a major spring.  Hvergelmir is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson.  In the Poetic Edda, Hvergelmir is mentioned in a single stanza, which details that it is the location where liquid from the antlers of the stag Eikþyrnir flow, and that the spring, "whence all waters rise", is the source of numerous rivers.  Thorpe (1866:23).   The Prose Edda repeats this information and adds that the spring is located in Niflheim, that it is one of the three major springs at the primary roots of the cosmic tree Yggdrasil (the other two are Urðarbrunnr and Mímisbrunnr), and that within the spring are a vast amount of snakes and the dragon Níðhöggr. 

Hausdorff maximal principle<====>13665<====>Hausdorff maximal principleIn mathematics, the Hausdorff maximal principle is an alternate and earlier formulation of Zorn's lemma proved by Felix Hausdorff in 1914 (Moore 1982:168).  It states that in any partially ordered set, every totally ordered subset is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset. The Hausdorff maximal principle is one of many statements equivalent to the axiom of choice over ZF (Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice).  The principle is also called the Hausdorff maximality theorem or the Kuratowski lemma (Kelley 1955:33). StatementThe Hausdorff maximal principle states that, in any partially ordered set, every totally ordered subset is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset. 

Hel (being)<====>13666<====>Hel (being)In Norse mythology, Hel is a being who presides over a realm of the same name, where she receives a portion of the dead.  Hel is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson.  In addition, she is mentioned in poems recorded in Heimskringla and Egils saga that date from the 9th and 10th centuries, respectively.  An episode in the Latin work Gesta Danorum, written in the 12th century by Saxo Grammaticus, is generally considered to refer to Hel, and Hel may appear on various Migration Period bracteates. 

Hawar Islands<====>13667<====>Hawar Islands The Hawar Islands ( ; transliterated: Juzur Ḩawār) are an archipelago of desert islands owned by Bahrain, situated off the west coast of Qatar in the Gulf of Bahrain of the Persian Gulf. DescriptionThe islands used to be one of the settlements of the Bahraini branch of the Dawasir who settled there in the early 19th century.   The islands were first surveyed in 1820, when they were called the Warden’s Islands, and two villages were recorded.    They are now uninhabited, other than a police garrison and a hotel on the main island; access to all but Hawar island itself is severely restricted. 

Hans-Dietrich Genscher<====>13669<====>Hans-Dietrich Genscher  Hans-Dietrich Genscher (21 March 1927 – 31 March 2016) was a German statesman and a member of the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), who served as the Minister of the Interior of West Germany from 1969 to 1974, and as the Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor of West Germany and then the reunified Germany from 1974 to 1992 (except for a two-week break in 1982), making him the longest-serving occupant of either post.  In 1991 he was chairman of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). A proponent of Realpolitik, Genscher has been called "a master of diplomacy. 

Henry Ainsworth<====>13675<====>Henry Ainsworth    Henry Ainsworth (1571–1622) was an English Nonconformist clergyman and scholar. LifeHe was born of a farming family of Swanton Morley, Norfolk.  He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, later moving to Caius College,  and, after associating with the Puritan party in the Church, eventually joined the Brownists.    Driven abroad to Holland in about 1593 due to the government of Queen Elizabeth's dissatisfaction with his non-conformist views,  he found a home in "a blind lane at Amsterdam", acting as "porter" to a bookseller, who, on discovering his knowledge of Hebrew, introduced him to other scholars. 

Hindu<====>13677<====>Hindu    Hindu ( ) refers to any person who regards themselves as culturally, ethnically, or religiously adhering to aspects of Hinduism.  Jeffery D.  Long (2007), A Vision for Hinduism, IB Tauris,  , pages 35-37   It has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, and later religious identifier for people indigenous to South Asia.   The historical meaning of the term Hindu has evolved with time.  Starting with the Persian and Greek references to the land of the Indus in the 1st millennium BCE through the texts of the medieval era,  the term Hindu implied a geographic, ethnic or cultural identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent around or beyond the Sindhu (Indus) river. 

Hernando de Alarcón<====>13678<====>Hernando de AlarcónHernando de Alarcón (born   1500) was a Spanish explorer and navigator of the 16th century, noted for having led an early expedition to the Baja California Peninsula, during which he became one of the first Europeans to ascend the Colorado River from its mouth and perhaps the first to reach Alta California.  Little is known about Alarcón's life outside of his exploits in New Spain.  He was probably born in the town of Trujillo, in present-day Extremadura, Spain, in the first years of the 16th century and traveled to the Spanish colonies in the Americas as a young man. 

Hakka cuisine<====>13679<====>Hakka cuisine   Hakka cuisine, or Kuh-chia cuisine, is the cooking style of the Hakka people, who may also be found in other parts of Taiwan and in countries with significant overseas Hakka communities.   There are numerous restaurants in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand serving Hakka cuisine.  Hakka cuisine was listed in 2014 on the first Hong Kong Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage.  The Hakka people have a marked cuisine and style of Chinese cooking which is little known outside the Hakka home.  It concentrates on the texture of food – the hallmark of Hakka cuisine. 

Hunan cuisine<====>13680<====>Hunan cuisine   Hunan cuisine, also known as Xiang cuisine, consists of the cuisines of the Xiang River region, Dongting Lake and western Hunan Province in China.  It is one of the Eight Great Traditions of Chinese cuisine and is well known for its hot and spicy flavours,    fresh aroma and deep colours.  Common cooking techniques include stewing, frying, pot-roasting, braising and smoking.  Due to the high agricultural output of the region, ingredients for Hunan dishes are many and varied. HistoryThe history of the cooking skills employed in Hunan cuisine dates back to the 17th century. 

Hyperinflation<====>13681<====>Hyperinflation  Certain figures in this article use scientific notation for readability. In economics, hyperinflation occurs when a country experiences very high and usually accelerating rates of inflation, rapidly eroding the real value of the local currency, and causing the population to minimize their holdings of local money.  The population normally switches to holding relatively stable foreign currencies.  Under such conditions, the general price level within an economy increases rapidly as the official currency quickly loses real value.   The value of economic items remains relatively stable in terms of foreign currencies. Unlike low inflation, where the process of rising prices is protracted and not generally noticeable except by studying past market prices, hyperinflation sees a rapid and continuing increase in nominal prices, the nominal cost of goods, and in the supply of money. 

Herbert Hoover<====>13682<====>Herbert Hoover   Herbert Clark Hoover (August 10, 1874 – October 20, 1964) was an American engineer, businessman and politician who served as the 31st President of the United States from 1929 to 1933 during the Great Depression.  A Republican, as Secretary of Commerce in the 1920s he introduced Progressive Era themes of efficiency in the business community and provided government support for standardization, efficiency and international trade.  As president from 1929 to 1933, his ambitious programs were overwhelmed by the Great Depression, which seemed to get worse every year because of his insistence on immediately paying for the increasingly large-scale interventions he made in the economy. 

Hildegard of Bingen<====>13684<====>Hildegard of Bingen   Hildegard of Bingen   ( ;  ; 1098 – 17 September 1179), also known as Saint Hildegard and Sibyl of the Rhine, was a German Benedictine abbess, writer, composer, philosopher, Christian mystic, visionary, and polymath.

The Hound of Heaven<====>13688<====>The Hound of Heaven"The Hound of Heaven" is a 182-line poem written by English poet Francis Thompson (1859–1907).  The poem became famous and was the source of much of Thompson's posthumous reputation.  The poem was first published in Thompson's first volume of poems in 1893.   It was included in the Oxford Book of English Mystical Verse (1917).  Thompson's work was praised by G.  K.  Chesterton, and it was also an influence on J.  R.  R.  Tolkien, who presented a paper on Thompson in 1914.  This Christian poem has been described as follows: "The name is strange. 

History of the Internet<====>13692<====>History of the Internet   The history of the Internet begins with the development of electronic computers in the 1950s.  Initial concepts of wide area networking originated in several computer science laboratories in the United States, United Kingdom, and France.   The US  Department of Defense awarded contracts as early as the 1960s, including for the development of the ARPANET project, directed by Robert Taylor and managed by Lawrence Roberts.  The first message was sent over the ARPANET  in 1969 from computer science Professor Leonard Kleinrock's laboratory at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to the second network node at Stanford Research Institute (SRI). 

Horace<====>13693<====>Horace   Quintus Horatius Flaccus (December 8, 65 BC – November 27, 8 BC), known in the English-speaking world as Horace (  or  ), was the leading Roman lyric poet during the time of Augustus (also known as Octavian).  The rhetorician Quintilian regarded his Odes as just about the only Latin lyrics worth reading: "He can be lofty sometimes, yet he is also full of charm and grace, versatile in his figures, and felicitously daring in his choice of words. " Quintilian 10. 1. 96.  The only other lyrical poet Quintilian thought comparable with Horace was the now obscure poet/metrical theorist, Caesius Bassus (R. 

History of Microsoft Windows<====>13694<====>History of Microsoft Windows   Microsoft Windows was announced by Bill Gates on November 10, 1983.   Microsoft introduced Windows as a graphical user interface for MS-DOS, which had been introduced a couple of years earlier.  In the 1990s, the product line evolved from an operating environment into a fully complete, modern operating system over two lines of development, each with their own separate codebase. The first versions of Windows (1. 0 through to 3. 11) were programs run from MS-DOS which then took over the screen and launched an application called Program Manager; later on, Windows 95, though still being based on MS-DOS, was its own operating system, using a 16-bit DOS-based kernel and a 32-bit user space.

Hobart<====>13699<====>Hobart    Hobart  ( )  is the capital and most populous city of the Australian island state of Tasmania.  With a population of approximately 225,000, it is the second least populated Australian capital city. Founded in 1804 as a penal colony,  Hobart is Australia's second oldest capital city after Sydney, New South Wales.  The modern history of Hobart (formerly "Hobart Town", or "Hobarton") dates to its foundation as a British colony in 1804.  Prior to British settlement, the area had been occupied for possibly as long as 35,000 years,  by the semi-nomadic Mouheneener tribe, a sub-group of the Nuennone, or South-East tribe. 

Hesiod<====>13700<====>Hesiod   Hesiod (  or  ;    Hēsíodos) was a Greek poet generally thought by scholars to have been active between 750 and 650 BC, around the same time as Homer.    He is generally regarded as the first written poet in the Western tradition to regard himself as an individual persona with an active role to play in his subject.   Ancient authors credited Hesiod and Homer with establishing Greek religious customs.   Modern scholars refer to him as a major source on Greek mythology, farming techniques, early economic thought (he is sometimes considered history's first economist),  archaic Greek astronomy and ancient time-keeping. 

Hebrew numerals<====>13702<====>Hebrew numerals The system of Hebrew numerals is a quasi-decimal alphabetic numeral system using the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The system was adapted from that of the Greek numerals in the late 2nd century BC. The current numeral system is also known as the Hebrew alphabetic numerals to contrast with earlier systems of writing numerals used in classical antiquity.  These systems were inherited from usage in the Aramaic and Phoenician scripts, attested from c.  800 BC in the so-called Samaria ostraca and sometimes known as Hebrew-Aramaic numerals, ultimately derived from the Egyptian Hieratic numerals. The Greek system was adopted in Hellenistic Judaism and had been in use in Greece since about the 5th century BC. 

Hero<====>13706<====>Hero   A hero (masculine) or heroine (feminine) is a person or main character of a literary work who, in the face of danger, combats adversity through feats of ingenuity, bravery or strength, often sacrificing their own personal concerns for a greater good. The concept of the hero can be found in classical literature.  It is the main or revered character in heroic epic poetry celebrated through ancient legends of a people, often striving for military conquest and living by a continually flawed personal honor code.The definition of a hero has changed throughout time. 

Hydroxide<====>13711<====>Hydroxide Hydroxide is a diatomic anion with chemical formula OH − .  It consists of an oxygen and hydrogen atom held together by a covalent bond, and carries a negative electric charge.  It is an important but usually minor constituent of water.  It functions as a base, a ligand, a nucleophile and a catalyst.  The hydroxide ion forms salts, some of which dissociate in aqueous solution, liberating solvated hydroxide ions.  Sodium hydroxide is a multi-million-ton per annum commodity chemical.  A hydroxide  attached to a strongly electropositive center may itself ionize,  liberating a hydrogen cation (H + ), making the parent compound an acid. 

H. R. Giger<====>13713<====>H.  R.  Giger  Hans Ruedi "H. R. " Giger (   ;  ; 5 February 1940 – 12 May 2014) was a Swiss painter, whose style was adapted for many forms of media, including record albums, furniture and tattoos. The Zurich-based artist was best known for airbrush images of humans and machines linked together in a cold 'biomechanical' relationship.  Later he abandoned airbrush work for pastels, markers, and ink.  He was part of the special effects team that won an Academy Award for design work on the film Alien.  In Switzerland there are two theme bars that reflect his interior designs, and his work is on permanent display at the H.

Hogshead<====>13726<====>HogsheadA hogshead (abbreviated "Hhd", plural "Hhds") is a large cask of liquid (or, less often, of a food commodity).   More specifically, it refers to a specified volume, measured in either imperial or US customary measures, primarily applied to alcoholic beverages, such as wine, ale, or cider. A tobacco hogshead was used in British and American colonial times to transport and store tobacco.  It was a very large wooden barrel.  A standardized hogshead measured   long and   in diameter at the head (at least  , depending on the width in the middle).  Fully packed with tobacco, it weighed about  .

Handball<====>13730<====>Handball  Handball (also known as team handball or Olympic handball)  is a team sport in which two teams of seven players each (six outfield players and a goalkeeper) pass a ball using their hands with the aim of throwing it into the goal of the other team.  A standard match consists of two periods of 30 minutes, and the team that scores more goals wins. Modern handball is played on a court  , with a goal in the middle of each end.  The goals are surrounded by a   zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed; goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while "diving" into it. 

Hilbert's basis theorem<====>13733<====>Hilbert's basis theoremIn mathematics, specifically commutative algebra, Hilbert's basis theorem says that a polynomial ring over a Noetherian ring is Noetherian. StatementIf  R  a ring, let  R[X]  denote the ring of polynomials in the indeterminate  X  over  R .  Hilbert proved that if  R  is "not too large", in the sense that if  R  is Noetherian, the same must be true for  R[X] .  Formally, Hilbert's Basis Theorem.  If  R  is a Noetherian ring, then  R[X]  is a Noetherian ring.   Corollary. 

Heterocyclic compound<====>13734<====>Heterocyclic compound A heterocyclic compound or ring structure is a cyclic compound that has atoms of at least two different elements as members of its ring(s).   Heterocyclic chemistry is the branch of organic chemistry dealing with the synthesis, properties, and applications of these heterocycles.   Examples of heterocyclic compounds include all of the nucleic acids, the majority of drugs, most biomass (cellulose and related materials), and many natural and synthetic dyes. ClassificationAlthough heterocyclic chemical compounds may be inorganic compounds or organic compounds, most contain at least one carbon.  While atoms that are neither carbon nor hydrogen are normally referred to in organic chemistry as heteroatoms, this is usually in comparison to the all-carbon backbone.

List of humorists<====>13744<====>List of humorists A humorist (US; British humourist) is an intellectual who uses humor in writing or public speaking.   Humorists are distinct from comedians, who are show business entertainers whose business is to make an audience laugh, though it is possible for some persons to occupy both roles in the course of their careers. Despite the fact that the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts annually bestows a Mark Twain Prize for American Humor (usually on comedians) since 1998, this award does not by itself qualify the recipient as a humorist.    only two recipients, Steve Martin and Neil Simon, are known as humorists, being humorous playwrights. 

Hydrostatic shock (firearms)<====>13746<====>Hydrostatic shock (firearms) Hydrostatic shock or hydraulic shock is the controversial concept that a penetrating projectile (such as a bullet) can produce a pressure wave that causes "remote neural damage", "subtle damage in neural tissues" and/or "rapid incapacitating effects" in living targets.It has also been suggested that pressure wave effects can cause indirect bone fractures at a distance from the projectile path, although it was later demonstrated that indirect bone fractures are caused by temporary cavity effects (strain placed on the bone by the radial tissue displacement produced by the temporary cavity formation).    Proponents of the concept argue that hydrostatic shock can produce remote neural damage and produce incapacitation more quickly than blood loss effects. 

Hadith<====>13749<====>Hadith A hadith (   or  ;, plural: ahadith,  ,   ) is one of various reports describing the words, actions, or habits of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.   The term comes from the Arabic language and means a "report", "account" or "narrative". Unlike the Qur'an, which is the same literary work recognized by all Muslims, the ahadith are not one single same collection. The ahadith refers to different hadith collections, and different branches of Islam (Sunni, Shia, Ibadi) consult different collections of hadith, while the relatively small sect of Quranists reject the authority of any of the hadith collections altogether. 

Hull (watercraft)<====>13755<====>Hull (watercraft) The hull is the watertight body of a ship or boat.  Above the hull is the superstructure and/or deckhouse, where present.  The line where the hull meets the water surface is called the waterline. The structure of the hull varies depending on the vessel type.  In a typical modern steel ship, the structure consists of watertight and non-tight decks, major transverse and watertight (and also sometimes non-tight or longitudinal) members called bulkheads, intermediate members such as girders,  s and webs, and minor members called ordinary transverse frames, frames, or longitudinals, depending on the structural arrangement. 

Hymn<====>13756<====>Hymn A hymn is a type of song, usually religious, specifically written for the purpose of adoration or prayer, and typically addressed to a deity or deities, or to a prominent figure or personification.  The word hymn derives from Greek   (hymnos), which means "a song of praise".  A writer of hymns is known as a hymnodist.  The singing or composition of hymns is called hymnody.  Collections of hymns are known as hymnals or hymn books.  Hymns may or may not include instrumental accompaniment. Although most familiar to speakers of English in the context of Christianity, hymns are also a fixture of other world religions, especially on the Indian subcontinent. 

History of physics<====>13758<====>History of physicsPhysics (from the Ancient Greek φύσις physis meaning "nature") is the fundamental branch of science that developed out of the study of nature and philosophy known, until around the end of the 19th century, as "natural philosophy".  Today, physics is ultimately defined as the study of matter, energy and the relationships between them.   Physics is, in some senses, the oldest and most basic pure science; its discoveries find applications throughout the natural sciences, since matter and energy are the basic constituents of the natural world.  The other sciences are generally more limited in their scope and may be considered branches that have split off from physics to become sciences in their own right. 

Hydrofoil<====>13761<====>Hydrofoil   A hydrofoil is a lifting surface, or foil, that operates in water.  They are similar in appearance and purpose to aerofoils used by aeroplanes.  Boats that use hydrofoil technology are also simply termed hydrofoils.  As a hydrofoil craft gains speed, the hydrofoils lift the boat's hull out of the water, decreasing drag and allowing greater speeds. DescriptionThe hydrofoil usually consists of a wing like structure mounted on struts below the hull, or across the keels of a catamaran in a variety of boats (see illustration).  As a hydrofoil-equipped watercraft increases in speed, the hydrofoil elements below the hull(s) develop enough lift to raise the hull out of the water, which greatly reduces hull drag. 

Henri Chopin<====>13763<====>Henri Chopin   Henri Chopin (18 June 1922 – 3 January 2008) was an avant-garde poet and musician. LifeHenri Chopin was born in Paris,18 June 1922, one of three brothers, and the son of an accountant.  Both his siblings died during the war.  One was shot by a German soldier the day after an armistice was declared in Paris, the other while sabotaging a train  . Chopin was a French practitioner of concrete and sound poetry, well known throughout the second half of the 20th century.  His work, though iconoclastic, remained well within the historical spectrum of poetry as it moved from a spoken tradition to the printed word and now back to the spoken word again  . 

Hassium<====>13764<====>Hassium  Hassium is a synthetic chemical element with symbol Hs and atomic number 108.  It is named after the German state of Hesse.  It is a synthetic element and radioactive; the most stable known isotope,  270 Hs, has a half-life of approximately 10 seconds.  More than 100 atoms of hassium have been synthesized to date.  In the periodic table of the elements, it is a d-block transactinide element.  Hassium is a member of the 7th period and belongs to the group 8 elements: it is thus the sixth member of the 6d series of transition metals. 

Henry Kissinger<====>13765<====>Henry Kissinger  Henry Alfred Kissinger ( ;  born Heinz Alfred Kissinger,  ; May 27, 1923) is an American diplomat and political scientist who served as the United States Secretary of State and National Security Advisor under the presidential administrations of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.  A Jewish refugee who fled Nazi Germany with his family in 1938, he became National Security Advisor in 1969 and later concurrently United States Secretary of State in 1973.  For his actions negotiating a ceasefire in Vietnam, Kissinger received the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize under controversial circumstances,  with two members of the committee resigning in protest. 

Hydra (genus)<====>13767<====>Hydra (genus)  Hydra   is a genus of small, fresh-water organisms of the phylum Cnidaria and class Hydrozoa.  They are native to the temperate and tropical regions.    Biologists are especially interested in Hydra because of their regenerative ability — they do not appear to die of old age, or indeed to age at all. MorphologyHydra has a tubular, radially symmetric body up to   long when extended, secured by a simple adhesive foot called the basal disc.  Gland cells in the basal disc secrete a sticky fluid that accounts for its adhesive properties. 

Hydrus<====>13768<====>Hydrus    Hydrus   is a small constellation in the deep southern sky.  It was one of twelve constellations created by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman and it first appeared on a 35-cm (14 in) diameter celestial globe published in late 1597 (or early 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius.  The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer's Uranometria of 1603.  The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted the brighter stars and gave their Bayer designations in 1756. 

Hercules<====>13770<====>Hercules    Hercules is a Roman hero and god.  He was the equivalent of the Greek divine hero Heracles, who was the son of Zeus (Roman equivalent Jupiter) and the mortal Alcmene.  In classical mythology, Hercules is famous for his strength and for his numerous far-ranging adventures. The Romans adapted the Greek hero's iconography and myths for their literature and art under the name Hercules.  In later Western art and literature and in popular culture, Hercules is more commonly used than Heracles as the name of the hero.  Hercules was a multifaceted figure with contradictory characteristics, which enabled later artists and writers to pick and choose how to represent him. 

History of Poland<====>13772<====>History of Poland The history of Poland originates in the migrations of Slavs who established permanent settlements in the Polish lands during the Early Middle Ages.   .   The first ruling dynasty, the Piasts, emerged by the 10th century AD.  Duke Mieszko I (d.  992) is considered the de facto creator of the Polish state and is widely recognized for the adoption of Western Christianity that followed his baptism in 966.  Mieszko's duchy of Poland was formally reconstituted as a medieval kingdom in 1025 by his son Bolesław I the Brave, known for military expansion under his rule. 

Hradčany<====>13773<====>Hradčany  Hradčany ( ;  ), the Castle District, is the district of the city of Prague, Czech Republic surrounding Prague Castle. The castle is said to be the biggest castle in the world  at about   in length and an average of about   wide.  Its history stretches back to the 9th century.  St Vitus Cathedral is located in the castle area. Most of the district consists of noble historical palaces.  There are many other attractions for visitors: romantic nooks, peaceful places and beautiful lookouts. Hradčany was an independent borough until 1784, when the four independent boroughs that had formerly constituted Prague were proclaimed a single city. 

Houston<====>13774<====>Houston   Houston (   ) is the most populous city in the U. S.  state of Texas and the fourth-most populous city in the United States, with a census-estimated 2016 population of 2. 303 million    within a land area of  .It is also the largest city in the Southern United States,  and the seat of Harris County.  Located in Southeast Texas near the Gulf of Mexico, it is the principal city of the Greater Houston metro area, which is the fifth-most populated MSA in the United States. 

Hard disk drive<====>13777<====>Hard disk drive   A hard disk drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive or fixed disk  is a data storage device that uses magnetic storage to store and retrieve digital information using one or more rigid rapidly rotating disks (platters) coated with magnetic material.  The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces.Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored or retrieved in any order and not only sequentially.  HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data even when powered off. 

Hebrew calendar<====>13782<====>Hebrew calendar  The Hebrew or Jewish calendar ( , Ha-Luah ha-Ivri) is a lunisolar calendar used today predominantly for Jewish religious observances.  It determines the dates for Jewish holidays and the appropriate public reading of Torah portions, yahrzeits (dates to commemorate the death of a relative), and daily Psalm readings, among many ceremonial uses.  In Israel, it is used for religious purposes, provides a time frame for agriculture and is an official calendar for civil purposes, although the latter usage has been steadily declining in favor of the Gregorian calendar. The present Hebrew calendar is the product of evolution, including a Babylonian influence. 

The Holocaust Industry<====>13786<====>The Holocaust Industry The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering is a 2000 book by Norman G.  Finkelstein, in which the author argues that the American Jewish establishment exploits the memory of the Nazi Holocaust for political and financial gain, as well as to further the interests of Israel.   According to Finkelstein, this "Holocaust industry" has corrupted Jewish culture and the authentic memory of the Holocaust. Finkelstein on the bookFinkelstein states that his consciousness of "the Nazi holocaust" is rooted in his parents' experiences in the Warsaw Ghetto; with the exception of his parents themselves, "every family member on both sides was exterminated by the Nazis". 

Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn<====>13787<====>Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn  The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn ( ; or, more commonly, the Golden Dawn (Aurora Aurea)) was an organization devoted to the study and practice of the occult, metaphysics, and paranormal activities during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Known as a magical order, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was active in Great Britain and focused its practices on theurgy and spiritual development.   Many present-day concepts of ritual and magic that are at the centre of contemporary traditions, such as Wicca Colquhoun, Ithell (1975) The Sword of Wisdom: MacGregor Mathers & the Golden Dawn. 

Hash function<====>13790<====>Hash function  A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size.  The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes.  One use is a data structure called a hash table, widely used in computer software for rapid data lookup.  Hash functions accelerate table or database lookup by detecting duplicated records in a large file.   An example is finding similar stretches in DNA sequences.  They are also useful in cryptography.  A cryptographic hash function allows one to easily verify that some input data maps to a given hash value, but if the input data is unknown, it is deliberately difficult to reconstruct it (or equivalent alternatives) by knowing the stored hash value. 

High jump<====>13791<====>High jump   The high jump is a track and field event in which competitors must jump unaided over a horizontal bar placed at measured heights without dislodging it.  In its modern most practised format, a bar is placed between two standards with a crash mat for landing.  In the modern era, athletes run towards the bar and use the Fosbury Flop method of jumping, leaping head first with their back to the bar.  Since ancient times, competitors have introduced increasingly effective techniques to arrive at the current form. The discipline is, alongside the pole vault, one of two vertical clearance events to feature on the Olympic athletics programme. 

Heraclitus<====>13792<====>Heraclitus  Heraclitus of Ephesus ( ;   ,  ; c.  535 – c.  475 BC) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher, and a native of the city of Ephesus,  then part of the Persian Empire.  He was of distinguished parentage.  Little is known about his early life and education, but he regarded himself as self-taught and a pioneer of wisdom.  From the lonely life he led, and still more from the apparently riddled  and allegedly paradoxical  nature of his philosophy and his stress upon the needless unconsciousness of humankind,  he was called "The Obscure" and the "Weeping Philosopher". 

Harrison Schmitt<====>13793<====>Harrison Schmitt Harrison Hagan "Jack" Schmitt (born July 3, 1935) is an American geologist, retired NASA astronaut, university professor, former U. S.  senator from New Mexico, and the most recent living person to have walked on the Moon.  As of 2018, he is also the last living crew member of Apollo 17. In December 1972, as one of the crew on board Apollo 17, Schmitt became the first member of NASA's first scientist-astronaut group to fly in space.  As Apollo 17 was the last of the Apollo missions, he also became the twelfth and second youngest person to set foot on the Moon, and the second-to-last person to step off of the Moon (he boarded the Lunar Module shortly before commander Eugene Cernan). 

Hilaire Rouelle<====>13795<====>Hilaire Rouelle  Hilaire Marin Rouelle (15 February 1718 – 7 April 1779) was an 18th-century French chemist. Commonly cited as the 1773 discoverer of urea, he was not the first to do so. Dutch scientist Herman Boerhaave had discovered this chemical as early as 1727.  Rouelle is known as "le cadet" (the younger) to distinguish him from his older brother, Guillaume-François Rouelle, who was also a chemist.References  DEFAULTSORT

Hammer<====>13802<====>HammerA hammer is a tool or device that delivers a blow (a sudden impact) to an object.  Most hammers are hand tools used to drive nails, fit parts, forge metal, and break apart objects.   Hammers vary in shape, size, and structure, depending on their purposes. Hammers are basic tools in many trades.  The usual features are a head (most often made of steel) and a handle (also called a   or  ).  Although most hammers are hand tools, powered versions exist; they are known as powered hammers.  Types of power hammer include steam hammers and trip hammers, often for heavier uses, such as forging. 

Hiragana<====>13804<====>Hiragana  is a Japanese syllabary, one component of the Japanese writing system, along with katakana, kanji, and in some cases rōmaji (Latin script).  It is a phonetic lettering system.  The word hiragana literally means "ordinary" or "simple" kana ("simple" originally as contrasted with kanji).   Hiragana and katakana are both kana systems.  With one or two minor exceptions, each sound in the Japanese language (strictly, each mora) is represented by one character (or one digraph) in each system.  This may be either a vowel such as "a" (hiragana  ); a consonant followed by a vowel such as "ka" ( ); or "n" ( ), a nasal sonorant which, depending on the context, sounds either like English m, n, or ng ( ), or like the nasal vowels of French. 

Hohenstaufen<====>13805<====>Hohenstaufen   The Staufer, also known as the House of Staufen, or of Hohenstaufen, were a dynasty of German kings (1138–1254) during the Middle Ages.  Besides Germany, they also ruled the Kingdom of Sicily (1194–1268).  In Italian historiography, they are known as the Svevi (Swabians), since they were (successive) dukes of Swabia from 1079.  Three members of the dynasty—Frederick I, Henry VI and Frederick II—were crowned Holy Roman Emperor. NameThe dynasty is named for their seat at Hohenstaufen Castle, which was in turn named for a nearby conical hill of the Swabian Jura with the name Hohenstaufen (now in Göppingen, Baden-Württemberg). 

History of Malaysia<====>13806<====>History of Malaysia   Malaysia is a Southeast Asian country located on a strategic sea-lane that exposes it to global trade and foreign culture.  Hinduism from India and Buddhism and Taoism from China dominated early regional history, reaching their peak during the reign of the Sumatra-based Srivijaya civilisation, whose influence extended through Sumatra, Java, the Malay Peninsula and much of Borneo from the 7th to the 13th centuries. Although Muslims had passed through the Malay Peninsula as early as the 10th century, it was not until the 14th century that Islam first firmly established itself.  The adoption of Islam in the 14th century saw the rise of a number of sultanates, the most prominent of which was the Sultanate of Malacca. 

History of Israel<====>13808<====>History of Israel    Modern Israel is roughly located on the site of the ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judah.  The area (also known as Land of Israel and as Palestine) is the birthplace of the Hebrew language, the place that the Hebrew Bible was composed and the birthplace of Judaism and Christianity.  It contains sites sacred to Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Samaritanism, Druze and the Bahá'í Faith. The Land of Israel has come under the sway of various empires and has been home to a variety of ethnicities, but was predominantly Jewish from roughly 1,000 years before the Common Era (BCE) until the 3rd century of the Common Era (CE).

Harvey Mudd College shares university resources such as libraries, dining halls, health services and campus security with the other Claremont Colleges, although each college is independently managed, with their own faculty, board of trustees, endowment, and admissions procedures. 

Heaven<====>13811<====>Heaven Heaven, or the heavens, is a common religious, cosmological, or transcendent place where beings such as gods, angels, jinn, saints, or venerated ancestors are said to originate, be enthroned, or live.  According to the beliefs of some religions, heavenly beings can descend to earth or incarnate, and earthly beings can ascend to Heaven in the afterlife, or in exceptional cases enter Heaven alive. Heaven is often described as a "higher place", the holiest place, a Paradise, in contrast to Hell or the Underworld or the "low places", and universally or conditionally accessible by earthly beings according to various standards of divinity, goodness, piety, faith, or other virtues or right beliefs or simply the will of God. 

History of Libya<====>13812<====>History of Libya  Libya's history covers its rich mix of ethnic groups added to the indigenous Berber tribes.  Berbers have been present throughout the entire history of the country.  For most of its history, Libya has been subjected to varying degrees of foreign control, from Europe, Asia, and Africa.  The modern history of independent Libya began in 1951. The history of Libya comprises six distinct periods: Ancient Libya, the Roman era, the Islamic era, Ottoman rule, Italian rule, and the Modern era. Prehistoric and Berber Libya Tens of thousands of years ago, the Sahara Desert, which now covers roughly 90% of Libya, was lush with green vegetation. 

History of Afghanistan<====>13813<====>History of Afghanistan The history of Afghanistan, (    ( )   began in 1747 with its establishment by Ahmad Shah Durrani.  The written recorded history of the land presently constituting Afghanistan can be traced back to around 500 BCE when the area was under the Achaemenid Empire,  although evidence indicates that an advanced degree of urbanized culture has existed in the land since between 3000 and 2000 BCE. The Indus Valley Civilisation stretched up to large parts of Afghanistan in the north, with several sites being known. 

History of modern Greece<====>13814<====>History of modern Greece   The history of modern Greece covers the history of Greece from the recognition of its autonomy from the Ottoman Empire by the Great Powers (Great Britain, France, and Russia) in 1828, after the Greek War of Independence, to the present day. Background The Byzantine Empire had ruled most of the Greek-speaking world since late Antiquity, but experienced a decline as a result of Muslim Arab and Seljuk Turkish invasions and was fatally weakened  by the sacking of Constantinople by the Latin Crusaders in 1204.  The establishment of Catholic Latin states on Greek soil, and the struggles of the Orthodox Byzantine Greeks against them, led to the emergence of a distinct Greek national identity. 

Heracles<====>13815<====>Heracles  Heracles (   ;  , Hēraklēs, from Hēra, "Hera"), born Alcaeus    ( , Alkaios) or Alcides  ( , Alkeidēs), was a divine hero in Greek mythology, the son of Zeus and Alcmene, foster son of Amphitryon By his adoptive descent through Amphitryon, Heracles receives the epithet Alcides, as "of the line of Alcaeus", father of Amphitryon.   Amphitryon's own, mortal son was Iphicles  and great-grandson and half-brother (as they are both sired by the god Zeus) of Perseus.  He was the greatest of the Greek heroes, a paragon of masculinity, the ancestor of royal clans who claimed to be Heracleidae ( ), and a champion of the Olympian order against chthonic monsters.

Following the band's breakup, Rollins established the record label and publishing company 2. 

Hadron<====>13821<====>HadronIn particle physics, a hadron   ( , hadrós, "stout, thick") is a composite particle made of quarks held together by the strong force in a similar way as molecules are held together by the electromagnetic force. Hadrons are categorized into two families: baryons, made of three quarks, and mesons, made of one quark and one antiquark.  Protons and neutrons are examples of baryons; pions are an example of a meson.  Hadrons containing more than three valence quarks (exotic hadrons) have been discovered in recent years.  A tetraquark state (an exotic meson), named the Z(4430) − , was discovered in 2007 by the Belle Collaboration    and confirmed as a resonance in 2014 by the LHCb collaboration. 

Heisuke Hironaka<====>13822<====>Heisuke Hironaka    is a Japanese mathematician.  He entered Kyoto University in 1949.  After completing his undergraduate studies at Kyoto University, he received his Ph. D.  in 1960 from Harvard while under the direction of Oscar Zariski.    He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1970.   He is celebrated for proving in 1964 that singularities of algebraic varieties admit resolutions in characteristic zero.   This means that any algebraic variety can be replaced by (more precisely is birationally equivalent to) a similar variety which has no singularities.  He also introduced Hironaka's example showing that a deformation of Kähler manifolds need not be Kähler. 

House of Habsburg<====>13824<====>House of Habsburg   The House of Habsburg ( ;  , traditionally spelled Hapsburg in English), also called House of Austria  was one of the most influential and outstanding royal houses of Europe.  The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs between 1438 and 1740.  The house also produced emperors and kings of the Kingdom of Bohemia, Kingdom of England (Jure uxoris King), Kingdom of Germany, Kingdom of Hungary, Kingdom of Croatia, Kingdom of Illyria,Second Mexican Empire, Kingdom of Ireland (Jure uxoris King), Kingdom of Portugal, and Kingdom of Spain, as well as rulers of several Dutch and Italian principalities.

House of Commons of the United Kingdom<====>13828<====>House of Commons of the United Kingdom   The House of Commons is the lower house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  Like the upper house, the House of Lords, it meets in the Palace of Westminster.  Officially, the full name of the house is the Honourable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled.  Offices however extend to Portcullis House due to shortage of space.  The Commons is an elected body consisting of 650 members known as Members of Parliament (MPs).  Members are elected to represent constituencies by first-past-the-post and hold their seats until Parliament is dissolved. 

Hearts<====>13829<====>Hearts   Hearts is an "evasion-type" trick-taking playing card game for four players, although variations can accommodate 3–6 players.  The game is also known as Black Lady,    Black Maria, Black Widow, and Slippery Bitch,though any of these may refer to the similar but differently-scored game Black Lady.  The game is a member of the Whist family of trick-taking games (which also includes Bridge and Spades), but the game is unique among Whist variants in that it is an evasion-type game; players avoid winning certain penalty cards in tricks, usually by avoiding winning tricks altogether. 

Hastings<====>13830<====>Hastings    Hastings   is a town and borough in East Sussex on the south coast of England,  east of the county town of Lewes and   south east of London.  It has an estimated population of 90,254.  Hastings gives its name to the Battle of Hastings, which took place   to the north at Senlac Hill in 1066.  The town later became one of the medieval Cinque Ports, and a popular seaside resort in the 19th century with the coming of the railway.  Hastings is a fishing port with a beach-based fishing fleet. 

Human rights<====>13831<====>Human rights Human rights are moral principles or norms James Nickel, with assistance from Thomas Pogge, M. B. E.  Smith, and Leif Wenar, December 13, 2013, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Human Rights, Retrieved August 14, 2014  that describe certain standards of human behaviour, and are regularly protected as legal rights in municipal and international law.   They are commonly understood as inalienable  fundamental rights "to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being",  and which are "inherent in all human beings" Burns H. 

Hash table<====>13833<====>Hash tableIn computing, a hash table (hash map) is a data structure which implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.  A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ an imperfect hash function, which might cause hash collisions where the hash function generates the same index for more than one key. 

"Hello, World!" program<====>13834<====>"Hello, World!" program A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs or displays "Hello, World!" to a user.  Being a very simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working program.   It is often the very first program people write when they are new to a language. PurposeA "Hello, World!" program is traditionally used to introduce novice programmers to a programming language. "Hello, world!" is also traditionally used in a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it. 

History of Hebrew grammar<====>13845<====>History of Hebrew grammar Hebrew grammar is the grammar of the Hebrew language. History of studies in Hebrew grammar The Masoretes in the 7th to 11th centuries laid the foundation for grammatical analysis of Hebrew.  As early as the 9th century Judah ibn Kuraish discussed the relationship between Arabic and Hebrew.  In the 10th century, Aaron ben Moses ben Asher refined the Tiberian vocalization, an extinct pronunciation of the Hebrew Bible. The first treatises on Hebrew grammar appear in the High Middle Ages, in the context of Midrash (a method of interpreting and studying the Hebrew Bible).  The Karaite tradition originated in Abbasid Baghdad around the 7th century. 

Modern Hebrew phonology<====>13846<====>Modern Hebrew phonologyModern Hebrew is phonetically simpler than Biblical Hebrew and has fewer phonemes, but it is phonologically more complex.  It has 25 to 27 consonants  and 8 to 10 vowels , depending on the speaker and the analysis. Hebrew has been used primarily for liturgical, literary, and scholarly purposes for most of the past two millennia.  As a consequence, its pronunciation was strongly influenced by the vernacular of individual Jewish communities.  With the revival of Hebrew as a native language, and especially with the establishment of Israel, the pronunciation of the modern language rapidly coalesced. 

House of Hohenzollern<====>13849<====>House of Hohenzollern  The House of Hohenzollern   is a dynasty of former princes, electors, kings and emperors of Hohenzollern, Brandenburg, Prussia, the German Empire, and Romania.  The family arose in the area around the town of Hechingen in Swabia during the 11th century and took their name from Hohenzollern Castle.   The first ancestor of the Hohenzollerns was mentioned in 1061.  The Hohenzollern family split into two branches, the Catholic Swabian branch and the Protestant Franconian branch, Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Fürstliche Häuser XIX.  "Haus Hohenzollern".  C.

Hang gliding<====>13850<====>Hang gliding Hang gliding is an air sport or recreational activity in which a pilot flies a light, non-motorized foot-launched heavier-than-air aircraft called a hang glider.  Most modern hang gliders are made of an aluminium alloy or composite frame covered with synthetic sailcloth    to form a wing.  Typically the pilot is in a harness suspended from the airframe, and controls the aircraft by shifting body weight in opposition to a control frame. Early hang gliders had a low lift-to-drag ratio, so pilots were restricted to gliding down small hills.  By the 1980s this ratio significantly improved, and since then pilots can soar for hours, gain thousands of feet of altitude in thermal updrafts, perform aerobatics, and glide cross-country for hundreds of kilometres. 

History of France<====>13854<====>History of France  The first written records for the history of France appear in the Iron Age.  What is now France made up the bulk of the region known to the Romans as Gaul.  Roman writers noted the presence of three main ethno-linguistic groups in the area: the Gauls, the Aquitani, and the Belgae.  The Gauls, the largest and best attested group, were Celtic people speaking what is known as the Gaulish language. Over the course of the 1st millennium BC the Greeks, Romans and Carthaginians established colonies on the Mediterranean coast and the offshore islands. 

Halloween<====>13855<====>Halloween Halloween or Hallowe'en (a contraction of All Hallows' Evening),    also known as Allhalloween,    All Hallows' Eve,    or All Saints' Eve,  is a celebration observed in a number of countries   on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day.  It begins the three-day observance of Allhallowtide,  the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the faithful departed.   It is widely believed that many Halloween traditions originated from ancient Celtic harvest festivals, particularly the Gaelic festival Samhain; that such festivals may have had pagan roots; and that Samhain itself was Christianized as Halloween by the early Church. 

Hayling Island<====>13859<====>Hayling Island   Hayling Island is an island off the south coast of England, in the borough of Havant in the county of Hampshire, near Portsmouth. HistoryAn Iron Age shrine in the north of Hayling Island was later developed into a Roman temple in the 1st century BC and was first recorded in Richard Scott's Topographical and Historical Account of Hayling Island, published in 1826.  The site was excavated between 1897 and 1907 and again from 1976 to 1978.   Remains are no longer visible and are buried beneath cultivated farmland.   The first coin credited to Commius that was found in an excavated context was found at the temple. 

Hahn–Banach theorem<====>13860<====>Hahn–Banach theoremIn mathematics, the Hahn–Banach theorem is a central tool in functional analysis.  It allows the extension of bounded linear functionals defined on a subspace of some vector space to the whole space, and it also shows that there are "enough" continuous linear functionals defined on every normed vector space to make the study of the dual space "interesting".  Another version of the Hahn–Banach theorem is known as the Hahn–Banach separation theorem or the separating hyperplane theorem, and has numerous uses in convex geometry. The theorem is named for the mathematicians Hans Hahn and Stefan Banach, who proved it independently in the late 1920s. 

Hampshire<====>13861<====>Hampshire    Hampshire ( ,  ; abbreviated Hants)  is a county on the southern coast of England in the United Kingdom.  The county town of Hampshire is Winchester, the former capital city of England.  Hampshire is the most populous ceremonial county in the United Kingdom (excluding the metropolitan counties) with almost half of the county's population living within the South Hampshire conurbation which includes the cities of Southampton and Portsmouth.The larger South Hampshire metropolitan area has a population of 1,547,000.Hampshire is notable for housing the birthplaces of the Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force. 

Hard science fiction<====>13862<====>Hard science fictionHard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy.   The term was first used in print in 1957 by P.  Schuyler Miller in a review of John W.  Campbell's Islands of Space in Astounding Science Fiction. The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction,  )  first appeared in the late 1970s.  The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the "hard" (natural) and "soft" (social) sciences. 

Handloading<====>13863<====>Handloading Handloading or reloading is the process of loading firearm cartridges or shotgun shells by assembling the individual components (case/hull, primer, powder, and bullet/shot), rather than purchasing completely assembled, factory-loaded ammunition. The term handloading is the more general term, as it refers to assembly of ammunition using components from any source.   Reloading refers more specifically to the assembly of ammunition re-using cases or shells from previously fired ammunition.   The terms are often used interchangeably, as the techniques are largely the same whether using new or previously fired components.   The differences lie in the preparation of the cases or shells; new components are generally ready to load, while previously fired components often need cleaning, removal of expended primers, and possibly other preparation to make them ready to load. 

Houston Texans<====>13864<====>Houston Texans  The Houston Texans are a professional American football team based in Houston, Texas.  The Texans compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the American Football Conference (AFC) South division.

The Texans replaced Houston's previous franchise, the Houston Oilers, which moved to Nashville, Tennessee and are now the Tennessee Titans.  The team's majority owner is Bob McNair.  While the team mainly struggled in the 2000s, they clinched their first playoff berth during the 2011 season as AFC South division champions. 

Heart of Oak<====>13865<====>Heart of Oak   “Heart of Oak” is the official march of the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom.  It is also the official march of several Commonwealth navies including the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal New Zealand Navy.  Royal Canadian Sea Cadets march to "Heart of Oak" during their parades.  (It was also the official march of the Royal Australian Navy, but has now been replaced by the new march, "Royal Australian Navy. ")The music of “Heart of Oak” was composed by William Boyce, and the words were written by the 18th-century English actor David Garrick. 

Harold Holt<====>13867<====>Harold Holt    Harold Edward Holt,   (5 August 1908 17 December 1967), was an Australian politician who served as the 17th Prime Minister of Australia, in office from 1966 until his presumed drowning death. Holt was born in Sydney, but lived in Melbourne from a young age.  He studied law at the University of Melbourne and eventually opened his own legal practice.  Holt entered parliament at a 1935 by-election, standing for the United Australia Party (UAP).  He was a protégé of Robert Menzies, and was added to cabinet – aged only 30 – when Menzies became prime minister for the first time in 1939. 

Heavy metal music<====>13869<====>Heavy metal musicHeavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music  that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom.   With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock,  the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness.  Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.  Fast (2005), pp.  89–91; Weinstein (2000), pp.  7, 8, 23, 36, 103, 104.  In 1968, three of the genre's most famous acts, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple were founded. 

Helvetii<====>13870<====>Helvetii  The Helvetii (   ) were a Gallic    tribe or tribal confederation    occupying most of the Swiss plateau at the time of their contact with the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC.  According to Julius Caesar, the Helvetians were divided into four subgroups or pagi.  Of these Caesar only names the Verbigeni and the Tigurini,  while Posidonius mentions the Tigurini and the Tougeni ( ).   They feature prominently in the Commentaries on the Gallic War, with their failed migration attempt to southwestern Gaul (58 BC) serving as a catalyst for Caesar's conquest of Gaul. 

Heretics of Dune<====>13871<====>Heretics of Dune   Heretics of Dune is a 1984 science fiction novel by Frank Herbert, the fifth in his Dune series of six novels.  It was ranked as the #13 hardcover fiction best seller of 1984 by The New York Times.  Plot introductionFifteen hundred years have passed since the 3,500-year reign of the God Emperor Leto II Atreides ended with his assassination; humanity is firmly on the Golden Path, Leto's plan to save humanity from destruction.

Halakha is often translated as "Jewish Law", although a more literal translation might be "the way to behave" or "the way of walking". 

History of ancient Israel and Judah<====>13876<====>History of ancient Israel and Judah   The Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah were related Iron Age kingdoms of the ancient Levant.  The Kingdom of Israel emerged as an important local power by the 10th century BCE before falling to the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 722 BCE.  Israel's southern neighbor, the Kingdom of Judah, emerged in the 8th or 9th century BCE Grabbe 2008, pp.  225–26.   and enjoyed a period of prosperity as a client state of first the Neo-Assyrian Empire and then the Neo-Babylonian Empire before a revolt against the latter led to its destruction in 586 BCE.

Henry J. Heinz<====>13879<====>Henry J.  Heinz  Henry John Heinz (October 11, 1844 – May 14, 1919) was an American-German entrepreneur who founded the H.  J.  Heinz Company based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  He was born in that city, the son of German immigrants from the Palatinate who came independently to the United States in the early 1840s.  Heinz developed his business into a national company which made more than 60 food products; one of its first was tomato ketchup.  He was influential for introducing high sanitary standards for food manufacturing.  He also exercised a paternal relationship with his workers, providing health benefits, recreation facilities, and cultural amenities. 

Heinz<====>13881<====>Heinz   The H.  J.  Heinz Company, or Heinz, was an American food processing company with world headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.   It was founded by Henry John Heinz in 1869.   The H.  J.  Heinz Company manufactures thousands of food products in plants on six continents, and markets these products in more than 200 countries and territories.   The company claims to have 150 number-one or number-two brands worldwide.Heinz ranked first in ketchup in the US with a market share in excess of 50%;   Ore-Ida label held 46% of the frozen potato sector in 2003. 

Huffman coding<====>13883<====>Huffman codingChar Freq Code space 7 111 a4 010 e4 000 f3 1101 h2 1010 i2 1000 m2 0111 n2 0010 s2 1011 t2 0110 l1 11001 o1 00110 p1 10011 r1 11000 u1 00111 x1 10010 In computer science and information theory, a Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding and/or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding, an algorithm developed by David A. Huffman while he was a Sc.D. student at MIT, and published in the 1952 paper "A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes". The output from Huffman's algorithm can be viewed as a variable-length code table for encoding a source symbol (such as a character in a file).  The algorithm derives this table from the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence (weight) for each possible value of the source symbol.  As in other entropy encoding methods, more common symbols are generally represented using fewer bits than less common symbols.  Huffman's method can be efficiently implemented, finding a code in time linear to the number of input weights if these weights are sorted.   However, although optimal among methods encoding symbols separately, Huffman coding is not always optimal among all compression methods.HistoryIn 1951, David A. Huffman and his MIT information theory classmates were given the choice of a term paper or a final exam. The professor, Robert M. Fano, assigned a term paper on the problem of finding the most efficient binary code. Huffman, unable to prove any codes were the most efficient, was about to give up and start studying for the final when he hit upon the idea of using a frequency-sorted binary tree and quickly proved this method the most efficient. In doing so, Huffman outdid Fano, who had worked with information theory inventor Claude Shannon to develop a similar code.  Building the tree from the bottom up guaranteed optimality, unlike top-down Shannon-Fano coding.TerminologyHuffman coding uses a specific method for choosing the representation for each symbol, resulting in a prefix code (sometimes called "prefix-free codes", that is, the bit string representing some particular symbol is never a prefix of the bit string representing any other symbol).  Huffman coding is such a widespread method for creating prefix codes that the term "Huffman code" is widely used as a synonym for "prefix code" even when such a code is not produced by Huffman's algorithm.Problem definitionInformal descriptionGivenA set of symbols and their weights (usually proportional to probabilities).FindA prefix-free binary code (a set of codewords) with minimum expected codeword length (equivalently, a tree with minimum weighted path length from the root).Formalized descriptionInput. Alphabet  A = \left\{a_{1},a_{2},\cdots,a_{n}\right\} , which is the symbol alphabet of size  n .  Tuple  W = (w_{1},w_{2},\cdots,w_{n}) , which is the tuple of the (positive) symbol weights (usually proportional to probabilities), i.e.  w_{i} = \mathrm{weight}\left(a_{i}\right), 1\leq i \leq n .   Output. Code  C\left(W\right) = (c_{1},c_{2},\cdots,c_{n}) , which is the tuple of (binary) codewords, where  c_{i}  is the codeword for  a_{i}, 1 \leq i \leq n .  Goal. Let  L\left(C\left(W\right)\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{w_{i}\times\mathrm{length}\left(c_{i}\right)}  be the weighted path length of code  C . Condition:  L\left(C\left(W\right)\right) \leq L\left(T\left(W\right)\right)  for any code  T\left(W\right) .ExampleWe give an example of the result of Huffman coding for a code with five characters and given weights. We will not verify that it minimizes L over all codes, but we will compute L and compare it to the Shannon entropy H of the given set of weights; the result is nearly optimal.Input (A, W) Symbol (a i ) a b c d e Sum Weights (w i ) 0.10 0.15 0.30 0.16 0.29 = 1 Output C Codewords (c i )  010   011   11   00   10    Codeword length (in bits) (l i ) 3 3 2 2 2 Contribution to weighted path length (l i  w i  ) 0.30 0.45 0.60 0.32 0.58 L(C) = 2.25 Optimality Probability budget (2 −l i  ) 1/8 1/8 1/4 1/4 1/4 = 1.00 Information content (in bits) (−log 2  w i ) ≈ 3.32 2.74 1.74 2.64 1.79   Contribution to entropy (−w i  log 2  w i ) 0.332 0.411 0.521 0.423 0.518 H(A) = 2.205 For any code that is biunique, meaning that the code is uniquely decodeable, the sum of the probability budgets across all symbols is always less than or equal to one. In this example, the sum is strictly equal to one; as a result, the code is termed a complete code. If this is not the case, you can always derive an equivalent code by adding extra symbols (with associated null probabilities), to make the code complete while keeping it biunique.As defined by Shannon (1948), the information content h (in bits) of each symbol a i  with non-null probability is h(a_i) = \log_2{1 \over w_i}.  The entropy H (in bits) is the weighted sum, across all symbols a i  with non-zero probability w i , of the information content of each symbol:  H(A) = \sum_{w_i > 0} w_i h(a_i) = \sum_{w_i > 0} w_i \log_2{1 \over w_i} = - \sum_{w_i > 0} w_i \log_2{w_i}.  (Note: A symbol with zero probability has zero contribution to the entropy, since  \lim_{w \to 0^+} w \log_2 w = 0  So for simplicity, symbols with zero probability can be left out of the formula above.)As a consequence of Shannon's source coding theorem, the entropy is a measure of the smallest codeword length that is theoretically possible for the given alphabet with associated weights. In this example, the weighted average codeword length is 2.25 bits per symbol, only slightly larger than the calculated entropy of 2.205 bits per symbol. So not only is this code optimal in the sense that no other feasible code performs better, but it is very close to the theoretical limit established by Shannon.In general, a Huffman code need not be unique.  Thus the set of Huffman codes for a given probability distribution is a non-empty subset of the codes minimizing  L(C)  for that probability distribution.  (However, for each minimizing codeword length assignment, there exists at least one Huffman code with those lengths.)Basic techniqueCompressionThe technique works by creating a binary tree of nodes. These can be stored in a regular array, the size of which depends on the number of symbols,  n . A node can be either a leaf node or an internal node. Initially, all nodes are leaf nodes, which contain the symbol itself, the weight (frequency of appearance) of the symbol and optionally, a link to a parent node which makes it easy to read the code (in reverse) starting from a leaf node. Internal nodes contain a weight, links to two child nodes and an optional link to a parent node. As a common convention, bit '0' represents following the left child and bit '1' represents following the right child. A finished tree has up to  n  leaf nodes and  n-1  internal nodes. A Huffman tree that omits unused symbols produces the most optimal code lengths.The process begins with the leaf nodes containing the probabilities of the symbol they represent. Then, the process takes the two nodes with smallest probability, and creates a new internal node having these two nodes as children. The weight of the new node is set to the sum of the weight of the children. We then apply the process again, on the new internal node and on the remaining nodes (i.e., we exclude the two leaf nodes), we repeat this process until only one node remains, which is the root of the Huffman tree.The simplest construction algorithm uses a priority queue where the node with lowest probability is given highest priority:Create a leaf node for each symbol and add it to the priority queue.While there is more than one node in the queue:Remove the two nodes of highest priority (lowest probability) from the queueCreate a new internal node with these two nodes as children and with probability equal to the sum of the two nodes' probabilities.Add the new node to the queue.The remaining node is the root node and the tree is complete.Since efficient priority queue data structures require O(log n) time per insertion, and a tree with n leaves has 2n−1 nodes, this algorithm operates in O(n log n) time, where n is the number of symbols.If the symbols are sorted by probability, there is a linear-time (O(n)) method to create a Huffman tree using two queues, the first one containing the initial weights (along with pointers to the associated leaves), and combined weights (along with pointers to the trees) being put in the back of the second queue. This assures that the lowest weight is always kept at the front of one of the two queues:Start with as many leaves as there are symbols.Enqueue all leaf nodes into the first queue (by probability in increasing order so that the least likely item is in the head of the queue).While there is more than one node in the queues:Dequeue the two nodes with the lowest weight by examining the fronts of both queues.Create a new internal node, with the two just-removed nodes as children (either node can be either child) and the sum of their weights as the new weight.Enqueue the new node into the rear of the second queue.The remaining node is the root node; the tree has now been generated.In many cases, time complexity is not very important in the choice of algorithm here, since n here is the number of symbols in the alphabet, which is typically a very small number (compared to the length of the message to be encoded); whereas complexity analysis concerns the behavior when n grows to be very large.It is generally beneficial to minimize the variance of codeword length. For example, a communication buffer receiving Huffman-encoded data may need to be larger to deal with especially long symbols if the tree is especially unbalanced. To minimize variance, simply break ties between queues by choosing the item in the first queue.   This modification will retain the mathematical optimality of the Huffman coding while both minimizing variance and minimizing the length of the longest character code. DecompressionGenerally speaking, the process of decompression is simply a matter of translating the stream of prefix codes to individual byte values, usually by traversing the Huffman tree node by node as each bit is read from the input stream (reaching a leaf node necessarily terminates the search for that particular byte value). Before this can take place, however, the Huffman tree must be somehow reconstructed. In the simplest case, where character frequencies are fairly predictable, the tree can be preconstructed (and even statistically adjusted on each compression cycle) and thus reused every time, at the expense of at least some measure of compression efficiency. Otherwise, the information to reconstruct the tree must be sent a priori. A naive approach might be to prepend the frequency count of each character to the compression stream. Unfortunately, the overhead in such a case could amount to several kilobytes, so this method has little practical use. If the data is compressed using canonical encoding, the compression model can be precisely reconstructed with just  B2^B  bits of information (where  B  is the number of bits per symbol). Another method is to simply prepend the Huffman tree, bit by bit, to the output stream. For example, assuming that the value of 0 represents a parent node and 1 a leaf node, whenever the latter is encountered the tree building routine simply reads the next 8 bits to determine the character value of that particular leaf. The process continues recursively until the last leaf node is reached; at that point, the Huffman tree will thus be faithfully reconstructed. The overhead using such a method ranges from roughly 2 to 320 bytes (assuming an 8-bit alphabet). Many other techniques are possible as well. In any case, since the compressed data can include unused "trailing bits" the decompressor must be able to determine when to stop producing output. This can be accomplished by either transmitting the length of the decompressed data along with the compression model or by defining a special code symbol to signify the end of input (the latter method can adversely affect code length optimality, however).Main propertiesThe probabilities used can be generic ones for the application domain that are based on average experience, or they can be the actual frequencies found in the text being compressed.This requires that a frequency table must be stored with the compressed text. See the Decompression section above for more information about the various techniques employed for this purpose.OptimalitySee also Arithmetic codingHuffman's original algorithm is optimal for a symbol-by-symbol coding with a known input probability distribution, i.e., separately encoding unrelated symbols in such a data stream.  However, it is not optimal when the symbol-by-symbol restriction is dropped, or when the probability mass functions are unknown.  Also, if symbols are not independent and identically distributed, a single code may be insufficient for optimality.  Other methods such as arithmetic coding often have better compression capability.Although both aforementioned methods can combine an arbitrary number of symbols for more efficient coding and generally adapt to the actual input statistics, arithmetic coding does so without significantly increasing its computational or algorithmic complexities (though the simplest version is slower and more complex than Huffman coding).  Such flexibility is especially useful when input probabilities are not precisely known or vary significantly within the stream.  However, Huffman coding is usually faster and arithmetic coding was historically a subject of some concern over patent issues.  Thus many technologies have historically avoided arithmetic coding in favor of Huffman and other prefix coding techniques.  As of mid-2010, the most commonly used techniques for this alternative to Huffman coding have passed into the public domain as the early patents have expired.For a set of symbols with a uniform probability distribution and a number of members which is a power of two, Huffman coding is equivalent to simple binary block encoding, e.g., ASCII coding.  This reflects the fact that compression is not possible with such an input, no matter what the compression method, i.e., doing nothing to the data is the optimal thing to do.Huffman coding is optimal among all methods in any case where each input symbol is a known independent and identically distributed random variable having a probability that is dyadic, i.e., is the inverse of a power of two.  Prefix codes, and thus Huffman coding in particular, tend to have inefficiency on small alphabets, where probabilities often fall between these optimal (dyadic) points.  The worst case for Huffman coding can happen when the probability of the most likely symbol far exceeds 2 −1  = 0.5, making the upper limit of inefficiency unbounded.There are two related approaches for getting around this particular inefficiency while still using Huffman coding.  Combining a fixed number of symbols together ("blocking") often increases (and never decreases) compression.  As the size of the block approaches infinity,  Huffman coding theoretically approaches the entropy limit, i.e., optimal compression.  However, blocking arbitrarily large groups of symbols is impractical, as the complexity of a Huffman code is linear in the number of possibilities to be encoded, a number that is exponential in the size of a block.  This limits the amount of blocking that is done in practice.A practical alternative, in widespread use, is run-length encoding.  This technique adds one step in advance of entropy coding, specifically counting (runs) of repeated symbols, which are then encoded.  For the simple case of Bernoulli processes, Golomb coding is optimal among prefix codes for coding run length, a fact proved via the techniques of Huffman coding.   A similar approach is taken by fax machines using modified Huffman coding.  However, run-length coding is not as adaptable to as many input types as other compression technologies.VariationsMany variations of Huffman coding exist,  some of which use a Huffman-like algorithm, and others of which find optimal prefix codes (while, for example, putting different restrictions on the output). Note that, in the latter case, the method need not be Huffman-like, and, indeed, need not even be polynomial time.n-ary Huffman codingThe n-ary Huffman algorithm uses the {0, 1, ... , n − 1} alphabet to encode message and build an n-ary tree. This approach was considered by Huffman in his original paper. The same algorithm applies as for binary (n equals 2) codes, except that the n least probable symbols are taken together, instead of just the 2 least probable. Note that for n greater than 2, not all sets of source words can properly form an n-ary tree for Huffman coding. In these cases, additional 0-probability place holders must be added. This is because the tree must form an n to 1 contractor; for binary coding, this is a 2 to 1 contractor, and any sized set can form such a contractor.  If the number of source words is congruent to 1 modulo n-1, then the set of source words will form a proper Huffman tree.Adaptive Huffman codingA variation called adaptive Huffman coding involves calculating the probabilities dynamically based on recent actual frequencies in the sequence of source symbols, and changing the coding tree structure to match the updated probability estimates. It is used rarely in practice, since the cost of updating the tree makes it slower than optimized adaptive arithmetic coding, which is more flexible and has better compression.Huffman template algorithmMost often, the weights used in implementations of Huffman coding represent numeric probabilities, but the algorithm given above does not require this; it requires only that the weights form a totally ordered commutative monoid, meaning a way to order weights and to add them. The Huffman template algorithm enables one to use any kind of weights (costs, frequencies, pairs of weights, non-numerical weights) and one of many combining methods (not just addition). Such algorithms can solve other minimization problems, such as minimizing  \max_i\left[w_{i}+\mathrm{length}\left(c_{i}\right)\right] , a problem first applied to circuit design. Length-limited Huffman coding/minimum variance Huffman codingLength-limited Huffman coding is a variant where the goal is still to achieve a minimum weighted path length, but there is an additional restriction that the length of each codeword must be less than a given constant. The package-merge algorithm solves this problem with a simple greedy approach very similar to that used by Huffman's algorithm. Its time complexity is  O(nL) , where  L  is the maximum length of a codeword. No algorithm is known to solve this problem in linear or linearithmic time, unlike the presorted and unsorted conventional Huffman problems, respectively.Huffman coding with unequal letter costsIn the standard Huffman coding problem, it is assumed that each symbol in the set that the code words are constructed from has an equal cost to transmit: a code word whose length is N digits will always have a cost of N, no matter how many of those digits are 0s, how many are 1s, etc. When working under this assumption, minimizing the total cost of the message and minimizing the total number of digits are the same thing.Huffman coding with unequal letter costs is the generalization without this assumption: the letters of the encoding alphabet may have non-uniform lengths, due to characteristics of the transmission medium. An example is the encoding alphabet of Morse code, where a 'dash' takes longer to send than a 'dot', and therefore the cost of a dash in transmission time is higher. The goal is still to minimize the weighted average codeword length, but it is no longer sufficient just to minimize the number of symbols used by the message. No algorithm is known to solve this in the same manner or with the same efficiency as conventional Huffman coding, though it has been solved by Karp whose solution has been refined for the case of integer costs by Golin. Optimal alphabetic binary trees (Hu–Tucker coding)In the standard Huffman coding problem, it is assumed that any codeword can correspond to any input symbol. In the alphabetic version, the alphabetic order of inputs and outputs must be identical. Thus, for example,  A = \left\{a,b,c\right\}  could not be assigned code  H\left(A,C\right) = \left\{00,1,01\right\} , but instead should be assigned either  H\left(A,C\right) =\left\{00,01,1\right\}  or  H\left(A,C\right) = \left\{0,10,11\right\} . This is also known as the Hu–Tucker problem, after T. C. Hu and Alan Tucker, the authors of the paper presenting the first linearithmic solution to this optimal binary alphabetic problem,  which has some similarities to Huffman algorithm, but is not a variation of this algorithm. These optimal alphabetic binary trees are often used as binary search trees.The canonical Huffman code If weights corresponding to the alphabetically ordered inputs are in numerical order, the Huffman code has the same lengths as the optimal alphabetic code, which can be found from calculating these lengths, rendering Hu–Tucker coding unnecessary. The code resulting from numerically (re-)ordered input is sometimes called the canonical Huffman code and is often the code used in practice, due to ease of encoding/decoding. The technique for finding this code is sometimes called Huffman-Shannon-Fano coding, since it is optimal like Huffman coding, but alphabetic in weight probability, like Shannon-Fano coding. The Huffman-Shannon-Fano code corresponding to the example is  \{000,001,01,10,11\} , which, having the same codeword lengths as the original solution, is also optimal. But in canonical Huffman code, the result is  \{110,111,00,01,10\} .ApplicationsArithmetic coding and Huffman coding produce equivalent results — achieving entropy — when every symbol has a probability of the form 1/2 k .  In other circumstances, arithmetic coding can offer better compression than Huffman coding because — intuitively — its "code words" can have effectively non-integer bit lengths, whereas code words in prefix codes such as Huffman codes can only have an integer number of bits. Therefore, a code word of length k only optimally matches a symbol of probability 1/2 k  and other probabilities are not represented optimally; whereas the code word length in arithmetic coding can be made to exactly match the true probability of the symbol.  This difference is especially striking for small alphabet sizes.Prefix codes nevertheless remain in wide use because of their simplicity, high speed, and lack of patent coverage.  They are often used as a "back-end" to other compression methods.  DEFLATE (PKZIP's algorithm) and multimedia codecs such as JPEG and MP3 have a front-end model and quantization followed by the use of prefix codes; these are often called "Huffman codes" even though most applications use pre-defined variable-length codes rather than codes designed using Huffman's algorithm.References  BibliographyThomas H.

High-density lipoprotein<====>13885<====>High-density lipoprotein High-density lipoproteins (HDL) are one of the five major groups of lipoproteins.   Lipoproteins are complex particles composed of multiple proteins which transport all fat molecules (lipids) around the body within the water outside cells.  They are typically composed of 80-100 proteins per particle (organized by one, two or three ApoA; more as the particles enlarge picking up and carrying more fat molecules) and transporting up to hundreds of fat molecules per particle. OverviewHDL particles have long been divided into 5 subgroups, by density/size (an inverse relationship), which also correlates with function and incidence of cardiovascular events.

Harmonic oscillator<====>13899<====>Harmonic oscillator  In classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system that, when displaced from its equilibrium position, experiences a restoring force, F, proportional to the displacement, x:  \vec F = -k \vec x \,  where k is a positive constant. If F is the only force acting on the system, the system is called a simple harmonic oscillator, and it undergoes simple harmonic motion: sinusoidal oscillations  about the equilibrium point, with a constant amplitude and a constant frequency (which does not depend on the amplitude). If a frictional force (damping) proportional to the velocity is also present, the harmonic oscillator is described as a damped oscillator.

Federation of Expellees<====>13902<====>Federation of Expellees The Federation of Expellees or Bund der Vertriebenen (BdV) is a non-profit organization formed in West Germany on 27 October 1957 to represent the interests of German nationals of all ethnicities and foreign ethnic Germans (usually naturalised as German nationals after 1949) who either fled their homes in parts of Central and Eastern Europe, or were forcibly expelled following World War II, and their families. Since 2014 the president of the Federation has been Bernd Fabritius, a Christian Social Union in Bavaria politician. Historical background It is estimated that in the aftermath of World War II between 13 and 16 million ethnic Germans fled or were expelled from parts of Central and Eastern Europe, including the former eastern territories of Germany (parts of present-day Poland), the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia (mostly from the Vojvodina region), the Kaliningrad Oblast of (now) Russia, hitherto USSR (in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War) and prior to this, the northern part of East Prussia, Lithuania, Romania and other East European countries. 

History of Albania<====>13904<====>History of Albania   The history of Albania forms a part of the history of Europe.  During the classical times, Albania was home to several Illyrian tribes such as the Ardiaei, Albanoi, Amantini, Enchele, Taulantii and many others, but also Thracian and Greek tribes, as well as several Greek colonies established on the Illyrian coast.   In the 3rd century BC, the area was annexed by Rome and became part of the Roman provinces of Dalmatia, Macedonia and Moesia Superior.  Afterwards, the territory remained under Roman and Byzantine control until the Slavic migrations of the 7th century.

Harp<====>13911<====>Harp    The harp is a stringed musical instrument that has a number of individual strings running at an angle to its soundboard; the strings are plucked with the fingers.  Harps have been known since antiquity in Asia, Africa and Europe, dating back at least as early as 3500 BCE.  The instrument had great popularity in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, where it evolved into a wide range of variants with new technologies, and was disseminated to Europe's colonies, finding particular popularity in Latin America.  Although some ancient members of the harp family died out in the Near East and South Asia, descendants of early harps are still played in Myanmar and parts of Africa, and other defunct variants in Europe and Asia have been utilized by musicians in the modern era. 

Hollow Earth<====>13912<====>Hollow Earth  The Hollow Earth is a pseudoscientific concept proposing that the planet Earth is entirely hollow or contains a substantial interior space.  The scientific community has dismissed the notion since at least the late-18th century.

Homeland<====>13920<====>Homeland   A homeland (  country of origin and native land) is the concept of the place (cultural geography) with which an ethnic group holds a long history and a deep cultural association – the country in which a particular national identity began.  As a common noun, homeland, it simply connotes the country of one's origin.  When used as a proper noun, the Homeland, as well as its equivalents in other languages, often have ethnic nationalist connotations.  A homeland may also be referred to as a fatherland, a motherland, or a mother country, depending on the culture and language of the nationality in question.
