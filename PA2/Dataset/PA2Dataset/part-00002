Hani Hanjour<====>13924<====>Hani Hanjour  Hani Saleh Hasan Hanjour ( ,  ;  August 30, 1972 September 11, 2001)  was the Saudi Arabian hijacker-pilot of American Airlines Flight 77, crashing the plane into the Pentagon as part of the September 11 attacks in 2001. Hanjour first came to the United States in 1991, enrolling at the University of Arizona, where he studied English for a few months before returning to Saudi Arabia early the next year.  He came back to the United States in 1996, studying English in California before he began taking flying lessons in Arizona.   He received his commercial pilot certificate in 1999, and went back to his native Saudi Arabia to find a job as a commercial pilot. 

Hyena<====>13926<====>Hyena  Hyenas or hyaenas (from Greek ὕαινα hýaina ) are any feliform carnivoran mammals of the family Hyaenidae  .  With only four extant species, it is the fifth-smallest biological family in the Carnivora, and one of the smallest in the class Mammalia.Despite their low diversity, hyenas are unique and vital components of most African ecosystems.    Although phylogenetically they are closer to felines and viverrids, hyenas are behaviourally and morphologically similar to canines in several elements of convergent evolution; both hyenas and canines are non-arboreal, cursorial hunters that catch prey with their teeth rather than claws. 

Hyaena<====>13927<====>Hyaena    Hyaena is a genus comprising two of the living species of hyenas: the striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) from western Asia and northern Africa and the brown hyena (Hyaena brunnea) from southern Africa.  The brown hyena has sometimes been placed in a separate genus Parahyaena, or even included in the otherwise fossil genus Pachycrocuta, but recent sources have tended to place it in Hyaena.  The brown hyena's skull is larger than that of the striped hyena.  The male brown hyena is slightly larger than the female, while the sexes of the striped hyena are equally sized . 

Hershey–Chase experiment<====>13928<====>Hershey–Chase experimentThe Hershey–Chase experiments were a series of experiments conducted in 1952  by Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase that helped to confirm that DNA is genetic material.   While DNA had been known to biologists since 1869,  many scientists still assumed at the time that proteins carried the information for inheritance because DNA appeared simpler than proteins.  In their experiments, Hershey and Chase showed that when bacteriophages, which are composed of DNA and protein,  infect bacteria, their DNA enters the host bacterial cell, but most of their protein does not.  Although the results were not conclusive, and Hershey and Chase were cautious in their interpretation, previous, contemporaneous, and subsequent discoveries all served to prove that DNA is the hereditary material. 

History of religions<====>13929<====>History of religions  The history of religion refers to the written record of human religious experiences and ideas.  This period of religious history begins with the invention of writing about 5,200 years ago (3200 BCE).  The prehistory of religion involves the study of religious beliefs that existed prior to the advent of written records.  One can also study comparative religious chronology through a timeline of religion. The word "religion" as used in the 21st century does not have an obvious pre-colonial translation into non-European languages.  The anthropologist Daniel Dubuisson writes that "what the West and the history of religions in its wake have objectified under the name 'religion' is . 

House music<====>13930<====>House music   House music is a genre of electronic music created by club DJs and music producers in Chicago in the early 1980s.   Early house music was generally characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines,    off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines.  While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, which preceded and influenced it, as both were DJ and record producer-created dance music, house was more electronic and minimalistic.   The mechanical, repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself; indeed, many house songs were instrumental, with no vocals, or if there was singing, the singer (typically female)  would not be well-known, or there would be no words. 

Hanover, New Hampshire<====>13937<====>Hanover, New Hampshire Hanover is a town along the Connecticut River in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States.  The population was 11,260 at the 2010 census.CNN and Money magazine rated Hanover the sixth best place to live in America in 2011,  and the second best in 2007.   "This just might be the best college town," read the headline of a story in the January-February 2017 issue of Yankee.  Dartmouth College and the US Army Corps of Engineers Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory are located in Hanover.  The Appalachian Trail crosses the town. 

HMS Beagle<====>13942<====>HMS Beagle   }   HMS Beagle was a Cherokee-class 10-gun brig-sloop of the Royal Navy, one of more than 100 ships of this class.  The vessel, constructed at a cost of  £7,803 (£  in today's currency), was launched on 11 May 1820 from the Woolwich Dockyard on the River Thames.  In July of that year she took part in a fleet review celebrating the coronation of King George IV of the United Kingdom, and for that occasion is said to have been the first ship to sail completely under the old London Bridge. 

History of St Albans<====>13945<====>History of St Albans St Albans is a city in southern Hertfordshire, England, 20 miles (32 km) north of London, beside the site of a Catuvellauni settlement and the Roman town of Verulamium on the River Ver.  It is Hertfordshire's oldest town. Pre-RomanThere was an Iron Age settlement known as Verulamium, Rosalind Niblett, Roman Hertfordshire, Wimborne: Dovecote Press, 1995  Verlamion, or Verlamio, near the site of the present city, the centre of Tasciovanus' power and a major center of the Catuvellauni from about 20 BC until shortly after the Roman invasion of AD 43.   The name "Verulamium" is Celtic, meaning "settlement over or by the marsh". 

Hitachi 6309<====>13951<====>Hitachi 6309The 6309 is Hitachi's CMOS version of the Motorola 6809 microprocessor.  While in "Emulation Mode" it is fully compatible with the 6809.  To the 6809 specifications it adds higher clock rates, enhanced features, new instructions, and additional registers.  Most new instructions were added to support the additional registers, as well as up to 32-bit math, hardware division, bit manipulations, and block transfers.  The 6309 is generally 30% faster in native mode than the 6809. Surprisingly, this information was never published by Hitachi.  The April 1988 issue of Oh! FM, a Japanese magazine for Fujitsu personal computer users, contained the first description of the 6309's additional capabilities. 

Hominy<====>13953<====>Hominy Hominy is a food produced from dried maize (corn in the U. S. ) kernels that have been treated with an alkali, in a process called nixtamalization.  ProductionHominy is made in a process called nixtamalization.  To make hominy, field corn (maize) grain is dried, then treated by soaking and cooking the mature (hard) grain in a dilute solution of lye (which can be produced from water and wood ash) or of slaked lime (calcium hydroxide, i. e.  from lime (material) as in limestone, not from lime (fruit)).  The soaked maize is washed.  Alkalinity helps dissolve hemicellulose, the major glue-like component of the maize cell walls, loosens the hulls from the kernels, and softens the corn. 

W. Heath Robinson<====>13955<====>W.  Heath RobinsonWilliam Heath Robinson (31 May 1872 – 13 September 1944) was an English cartoonist and illustrator best known for drawings of ridiculously complicated machines for achieving simple objectives.  In the UK, the term "Heath Robinson" entered the  popular language during the 1914–1918 First World War as a description of any unnecessarily complex and implausible contrivance, much as "Rube Goldberg machines" came to be used in the United States from the 1920s onwards as a term for similar efforts.  "Heath Robinson contraption" is perhaps more often used in relation to temporary fixes using ingenuity and whatever is to hand, often string and tape, or unlikely cannibalisations. 

Heraclius<====>13956<====>HeracliusHeraclius ( ,  ; c.  575 – February 11, 641) was the Emperor of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire from 610 to 641. He was responsible for introducing Greek as the Eastern Roman Empire's official language.  His rise to power began in 608, when he and his father, Heraclius the Elder, the exarch of Africa, led a revolt against the unpopular usurper Phocas. Heraclius's reign was marked by several military campaigns.  The year Heraclius came to power, the empire was threatened on multiple frontiers.  Heraclius immediately took charge of the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628. 

Henry the Fowler<====>13957<====>Henry the Fowler  Henry the Fowler (  or  ;  ) (876 – 2 July 936) was the duke of Saxony from 912 and the elected king of East Francia (Germany) from 919 until his death in 936.  As the first non-Frankish king, he established the Ottonian Dynasty of kings and emperors, he is generally considered to be the founder and first king of the medieval German state, known until then as East Francia.  An avid hunter, he obtained the epithet "the Fowler"  because he was allegedly fixing his birding nets when messengers arrived to inform him that he was to be king. 

Hannibal<====>13959<====>HannibalHannibal Barca (Punic language:  , ḥnb‘l brq; 247 – between 183 and 181 BC),  was a Carthaginian general, considered one of the greatest military commanders in history.  His father Hamilcar Barca was the leading Carthaginian commander during the First Punic War.  His younger brothers were Mago and Hasdrubal, and he was brother-in-law to Hasdrubal the Fair. Hannibal lived during a period of great tension in the Mediterranean Basin, when the Roman Republic established its supremacy over other great powers such as ancient Carthage and the Greek kingdoms of Macedonia, Syracuse, and the Seleucid Empire. 

Hansie Cronje<====>13961<====>Hansie Cronje   Wessel Johannes "Hansie" Cronje (25 September 1969 – 1 June 2002) was a South African cricketer and captain of the South African national cricket team in the 1990s.  He was voted the 11th greatest South African in 2004 despite having been banned from cricket for life due to his role in a match-fixing scandal.  He died in an plane crash in 2002. Early lifeCronje was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa to Ewie Cronje and San-Marie Cronje on 25 September 1969.  He graduated in 1987 from Grey College in Bloemfontein, where he was the head boy. 

Hultsfred Municipality<====>13963<====>Hultsfred Municipality{{Infobox settlement }}Hultsfred Municipality (Hultsfreds kommun) is a municipality in Kalmar County, in south-eastern Sweden.  The seat is in the town of Hultsfred. The present municipality was created in 1971 through the amalgamation of the market town (köping) of Hultsfred (instituted in 1927) with a number of surrounding municipalities.  In 1863 there were eight entities in the area. Hultsfred is known as the site of a major rock festival in Sweden, the Hultsfred Festival. GeographyBasically every one of the localities of Hultsfred Municipality are situated on the railway.  Besides Hultsfred, in the mid north of the municipality, there are the towns of Virserum in the south-west and other ever smaller settlements such as Lönneberga, Silverdalen and Målilla. 

Parliament of the United Kingdom<====>13964<====>Parliament of the United Kingdom  The Parliament of the United Kingdom, commonly known as the UK Parliament or British Parliament, is the supreme legislative body of the United Kingdom, its Crown dependencies and overseas territories.   It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and its territories.  Its head is the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently Queen Elizabeth II) and its seat is the Palace of Westminster in the City of Westminster, one of the central boroughs of the capital city, London. The parliament is bicameral, consisting of an upper house (the House of Lords) and a lower house (the House of Commons). 

Hosea<====>13966<====>Hosea    In the Hebrew Bible, Hosea (  or  ;  ; Greek  , Ōsēe), son of Beeri, was an 8th-century BC prophet in Israel who authored the book of prophecies bearing his name.  He is one of the Twelve Prophets of the Jewish Hebrew Bible, also known as the Minor Prophets of the Christian Old Testament.  Hosea is often seen as a "prophet of doom", but underneath his message of destruction is a promise of restoration.  The Talmud (Pesachim 87a) claims that he was the greatest prophet of his generation.  The period of Hosea's ministry extended to some sixty years and he was the only prophet of Israel of his time who left any written prophecy. 

Habakkuk<====>13967<====>Habakkuk   Habakkuk (  or  ;  ; also spelled Habacuc) was a prophet in the Hebrew Bible.  He is the author of the Book of Habakkuk, the eighth of the collected twelve minor prophets.  LifeAlmost nothing is known about Habakkuk, aside from what few facts are stated within the book of the Bible bearing his name, or those inferences that may be drawn from that book.   His name appears in the Bible only in Habakkuk 1:1 and 3:1, with no biographical details provided other than his title "the prophet. "  Even the origin of his name is uncertain. 

Haggai<====>13968<====>Haggai   Haggai    ( , Ḥaggay or Hag-i, Koine Greek: Ἀγγαῖος;  ) was a Hebrew prophet during the building of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, and one of the twelve minor prophets in the Hebrew Bible and the author of the Book of Haggai.  He is known for his prophecy in 520 BCE, commanding the Jews to rebuild the Temple.His name means "my holiday".  He was the first of three post-exile prophets from the Neo-Babylonian Exile of the House of Judah (with Zechariah, his contemporary, and Malachi, who lived about one hundred years later), who belonged to the period of Jewish history which began after the return from captivity in Babylon. 

Herman Hollerith<====>13969<====>Herman Hollerith  Herman Hollerith (February 29, 1860 – November 17, 1929) was an American inventor who developed an electromechanical punched card tabulator to assist in summarizing information and, later, accounting.  He was the founder of the Tabulating Machine Company that was  amalgamated (via stock acquisition)  in 1911 with three other companies to form a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company later renamed IBM.  Hollerith is regarded as one of the seminal figures in the development of data processing.   His invention of the punched card tabulating machine marks the beginning of the era of semiautomatic data processing systems, and his concept dominated that landscape for nearly a century. 

History of painting<====>13971<====>History of painting   The history of painting reaches back in time to artifacts from pre-historic humans, and spans all cultures.  It represents a continuous, though periodically disrupted, tradition from Antiquity.  Across cultures, and spanning continents and millennia, the history of painting is an ongoing river of creativity, that continues into the 21st century.Until the early 20th century it relied primarily on representational, religious and classical motifs, after which time more purely abstract and conceptual approaches gained favor. Developments in Eastern painting historically parallel those in Western painting, in general, a few centuries earlier. 

Hungarian language<====>13972<====>Hungarian language  Hungarian ( ) is the official language of Hungary and one of the 24 official languages of the European Union.  Outside Hungary it is also spoken by communities of Hungarians in the countries that today make up Slovakia, western Ukraine, central and western Romania (Transylvania and Partium), northern Serbia (Vojvodina), southern Poland, northern Croatia, and northern Slovenia due to the effects of the Treaty of Trianon which resulted in many ethnic Hungarians being displaced from their homes and communities in the former territories of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  It is also spoken by Hungarian diaspora communities worldwide, especially in North America (particularly the United States). 

Hymenoptera<====>13974<====>Hymenoptera  Hymenoptera is a large order of insects, comprising the sawflies, wasps, bees, and ants.  Over 150,000 living species of Hymenoptera have been described,  in addition to over 2,000 extinct ones.  Females typically have a special ovipositor for inserting eggs into hosts or places that are otherwise inaccessible.  The ovipositor is often modified into a stinger.  The young develop through holometabolism (complete metamorphosis)—that is, they have a worm-like larval stage and an inactive pupal stage before they mature. EtymologyThe name Hymenoptera refers to the  wings of the insects, but the original derivation is ambiguous. 

Hannibal Hamlin<====>13976<====>Hannibal Hamlin  Hannibal Hamlin (August 27, 1809 July 4, 1891) was an American attorney and politician from the state of Maine.   In a public service career that spanned over 50 years, he is most notable for having served as the 15th Vice President of the United States.  The first Republican to hold the office, Hamlin served from 1861 to 1865.  He is considered among the most influential politicians to have come from Maine. A native of Paris, Maine, Hamlin managed his father's farm before becoming a newspaper editor.  He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1833, and began to practice in Hampden, Maine. 

Hopwood Award<====>13978<====>Hopwood AwardThe Hopwood Awards are a major scholarship program at the University of Michigan, founded by Avery Hopwood. Under the terms of the will of Avery Hopwood, a prominent American dramatist and member of the Class of 1905 of The University of Michigan, one-fifth of Mr.  Hopwood's estate was given to the Regents of the University for the encouragement of creative work in writing.  The first awards were made in 1931, and today the Hopwood Program offers approximately $120,000 in prizes every year to aspiring writers at the University of Michigan.  According to Nicholas Delbanco, UM English Professor and Director of the Hopwood Awards Program, "This is the oldest and best known series of writing prizes in the country and it is a very good indicator of future success. 

Homeostasis<====>13980<====>Homeostasis  Homeostasis can be defined as  the stable condition of an organism and of its internal environment;  or as the maintenance or regulation of the stable condition, or its equilibrium;    or simply as the balance of bodily functions.   The stable condition is the condition of optimal functioning for the organism, and is dependent on many variables, such as body temperature and fluid balance, being kept within certain pre-set limits.Other variables include the pH of extracellular fluid, the concentrations of sodium, potassium and calcium ions, as well as that of the blood sugar level, and these need to be regulated despite changes in the environment, diet, or level of activity. 

Hockey<====>13981<====>Hockey   Hockey is a sport in which two teams play against each other by trying to maneuver a ball or a puck into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick.  There are many types of hockey such as bandy, field hockey and ice hockey. Often one variation of the sport, such as field hockey or ice hockey, will predominate in a certain area and be known simply as "hockey".  EtymologyThe first recorded use of the word hockey is in the 1773 book Juvenile Sports and Pastimes, to Which Are Prefixed, Memoirs of the Author: Including a New Mode of Infant Education by Richard Johnson (Pseud. 

Hawick<====>13983<====>Hawick   Hawick (   ;   ,  ) is a town in the Scottish Borders council area and historic county of Roxburghshire in the east Southern Uplands of Scotland.  It is   south-west of Jedburgh and   south-southeast of Selkirk.  It is one of the farthest towns from the sea in Scotland, in the heart of Teviotdale, and the biggest town in the former county of Roxburghshire.  Hawick's architecture is distinctive in that it has many sandstone buildings with slate roofs.  The town is at theconfluence of the Slitrig Water with the River Teviot. 

Hatfield, Hertfordshire<====>13985<====>Hatfield, HertfordshireHatfield is a town and civil parish in Hertfordshire, England, in the borough of Welwyn Hatfield.  It had a population of 29,616 in 2001,  and 39,201 at the 2011 Census.   The settlement is of Saxon origin.  Hatfield House, home of the Marquess of Salisbury, forms the nucleus of the old town.  From the 1930s when de Havilland opened a factory until the 1990s when British Aerospace closed it, aircraft design and manufacture employed more people there than any other industry.  Hatfield was one of the post-war New Towns built around London and has much modernist architecture from the period. 

Hertfordshire<====>13986<====>Hertfordshire    Hertfordshire (  ; often abbreviated Herts) is a county in southern England, bordered by Bedfordshire to the north, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Essex to the east, Buckinghamshire to the west and Greater London to the south.

Four towns have between 50,000 and 100,000 residents: Hemel Hempstead, Stevenage, Watford and St Albans.  Hertford, once the main market town for the medieval agricultural county, derives its name from a   (stag) and a ford, used as the components of the county's coat of arms and flag. 

Helene Kröller-Müller<====>13987<====>Helene Kröller-Müller Helene Kröller-Müller (11 February 1869 – 14 December 1939) was one of the first European women to put together a major art collection and credited as being one of the first collectors to recognise the genius of Vincent van Gogh.  She donated her entire collection to the Dutch people, along with her and her husband, Anton Müller's, large forested country estate.  Today it is the Kröller-Müller Museum and sculpture garden and Hoge Veluwe National Park, the largest national park in the Netherlands. She was born Helene Emma Laura Juliane Müller at  , Essen, Germany, into a wealthy industrialist family. 

Hans-Georg Gadamer<====>13988<====>Hans-Georg Gadamer Hans-Georg Gadamer ( ; February 11, 1900 – March 13, 2002) was a German philosopher of the continental tradition, best known for his 1960 magnum opus Truth and Method (Wahrheit und Methode) on hermeneutics.  He was a Protestant Christian.  LifeGadamer was born in Marburg, Germany,  the son of Johannes Gadamer (1867–1928),  a pharmaceutical chemistry professor who later also served as the rector of the University of Marburg.  He resisted his father's urging to take up the natural sciences and became more and more interested in the humanities.  His mother, Emma Karoline Johanna Geiese (1869–1904) died of diabetes while Hans-Georg was four years old, and he later noted that this may have had an effect on his decision to not pursue scientific studies. 

Honeymoon<====>13991<====>Honeymoon A honeymoon is the traditional holiday taken by newlyweds to celebrate their marriage in intimacy and seclusion.  Today, honeymoons are often celebrated in destinations considered   or romantic. HistoryThis is the period when newly wed couples take a break to share some private and intimate moments that helps establish love in their relationship.  This privacy in turn is believed to ease the comfort zone towards a physical relationship, which is one of the primary means of bonding during the initial days of marriage.  The earliest term for this in English was hony moone, which was recorded as early as 1546. 

Harold Kushner<====>13992<====>Harold Kushner  Rabbi Harold Samuel Kushner is a prominent American rabbi aligned with the progressive wing of Conservative Judaism,   and a popular author. EducationBorn in Brooklyn, Kushner was educated at Columbia University and later obtained his rabbinical ordination from the Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS) in 1960.  The same institution awarded him a doctoral degree in Bible in 1972.  Kushner has also studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, taught at Clark University and the Rabbinical School of the JTS, and received six honorary doctorates. Congregational RabbiHe served as the congregational rabbi of Temple Israel of Natick, in Natick, Massachusetts for 24 years and belongs to the Rabbinical Assembly. 

Heapsort<====>13995<====>Heapsort  In computer science, heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm.  Heapsort can be thought of as an improved selection sort: like that algorithm, it divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region.  The improvement consists of the use of a heap data structure rather than a linear-time search to find the maximum.  Although somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort, it has the advantage of a more favorable worst-case   runtime. 

Heap (data structure)<====>13996<====>Heap (data structure)In computer science, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the key of C.   The node at the "top" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node. The heap is one maximally efficient implementation of an abstract data type called a priority queue, and in fact priority queues are often referred to as "heaps", regardless of how they may be implemented. 

Hierarchy<====>13998<====>Hierarchy A hierarchy (from the Greek hierarchia, "rule of a high priest", from hierarkhes, "leader of sacred rites") is an arrangement of items (objects, names, values, categories, etc. ) in which the items are represented as being "above", "below", or "at the same level as" one another. A hierarchy can link entities either directly or indirectly, and either vertically or diagonally.  The only direct links in a hierarchy, insofar as they are hierarchical, are to one's immediate superior or to one of one's subordinates, although a system that is largely hierarchical can also incorporate alternative hierarchies.  Indirect hierarchical links can extend "vertically" upwards or downwards via multiple links in the same direction, following a path.

Hour<====>14004<====>Hour  An hour (symbol: h;  also abbreviated hr. ) is a unit of time conventionally reckoned as   of a day and scientifically reckoned as 3,599–3,601 seconds, depending on conditions. The seasonal, temporal, or unequal hour was established in the ancient Near East as   of the night or daytime.  Such hours varied by season, latitude, and weather.  It was subsequently divided into 60 minutes, each of 60 seconds.  Its East Asian equivalent was the shi, which was   of the apparent solar day; a similar system was eventually developed in Europe which measured its equal or equinoctial hour as   of such days measured from noon to noon. 

Hezekiah<====>14005<====>Hezekiah    Hezekiah ( , Hebrew:  ;   Ḥazaqya'u;  ;  ; also transliterated as Ḥizkiyyahu or Ḥizkiyyah) was, according to the Hebrew Bible, the son of Ahaz and the 13th king of Judah.  Harris, Stephen L. , Understanding the Bible.  Palo Alto: Mayfield.  1985.  "Glossary", pp.  367–432  Archaeologist Edwin Thiele has concluded that his reign was between c.  715 and 686 BC.   He is considered a very righteous king by the author of the Book of Kings.   He is also one of the most prominent kings of Judah mentioned in the Bible and is one of the kings mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew. 

Haemophilia<====>14006<====>Haemophilia    Haemophilia, also spelled hemophilia, is a mostly inherited genetic disorder that impairs the body's ability to make blood clots, a process needed to stop bleeding.   This results in people bleeding longer after an injury, easy bruising, and an increased risk of bleeding inside joints or the brain.   Those with a mild case of the disease may have symptoms only after an accident or during surgery.   Bleeding into a joint can result in permanent damage while bleeding in the brain can result in long term headaches, seizures, or a decreased level of consciousness. 

Hemicellulose<====>14009<====>HemicelluloseA hemicellulose (also known as polyose) is any of several heteropolymers (matrix polysaccharides), such as arabinoxylans, present along with cellulose in almost all plant cell walls.   While cellulose is crystalline, strong, and resistant to hydrolysis, hemicellulose has a random, amorphous structure with little strength.  It is easily hydrolyzed by dilute acid or base as well as a myriad of hemicellulase enzymes. CompositionHemicelluloses include xylan, glucuronoxylan, arabinoxylan, glucomannan, and xyloglucan.

Horsepower<====>14019<====>Horsepower  Horsepower (hp) is a unit of measurement of power (the rate at which work is done).  There are many different standards and types of horsepower.  Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower (or imperial horsepower), which is 745. 7 watts, and the metric horsepower, which is approximately 735. 5 watts. The term was adopted in the late 18th century by Scottish engineer James Watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses.  It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines, as well as turbines, electric motors and other machinery. 

History of London<====>14020<====>History of London   London, the capital city of England and the United Kingdom, has a history going back over 2,000 years.  During that time it has grown to one of the world's most significant financial and cultural capital cities.  It has withstood plague, devastating fire, civil war, aerial bombardment, terrorist attacks, and rioting. The City of London, often referred to simply as "the City", is Greater London's historic core and today is its primary financial district, though it now represents just a tiny part of the wider metropolis. Legendary foundations and prehistory. . . According to the legendary Historia Regum Britanniae, by Geoffrey of Monmouth, London was founded by Brutus of Troy about 1000–1100 B. 

History of astronomy<====>14021<====>History of astronomyAstronomy is the oldest of the natural sciences, dating back to antiquity, with its origins in the religious, mythological, cosmological, calendrical, and astrological beliefs and practices of prehistory: vestiges of these are still found in astrology, a discipline long interwoven with public and governmental astronomy, and not completely disentangled from it until a few centuries ago in the Western World (see astrology and astronomy).  In some cultures, astronomical data was used for astrological prognostication. Ancient astronomers were able to differentiate between stars and planets, as stars remain relatively fixed over the centuries while planets will move an appreciable amount during a comparatively short time. 

Haber process<====>14022<====>Haber processThe Haber process, also called the Haber–Bosch process, is an artificial nitrogen fixation process and is the main industrial procedure for the production of ammonia today.It is named after its inventors, the German chemists Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch, who developed it in the first half of the 20th century.  The process converts atmospheric nitrogen (N 2 ) to ammonia (NH 3 ) by a reaction with hydrogen (H 2 ) using a metal catalyst under high temperatures and pressures:N 2  + 3 H 2  → 2 NH 3  (ΔH° = −91. 8 kJ) => (ΔH° = −45.

H.263<====>14024<====>H. 263H. 263 is a video compression standard originally designed as a low-bit-rate compressed format for videoconferencing.  It was developed by the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) in a project ending in 1995/1996 as one member of the H. 26x family of video coding standards in the domain of the ITU-T, and it was later extended to add various additional enhanced features in 1998 and 2000.  Smaller additions were also made in 1997 and 2001, and a unified edition was produced in 2005. The H. 263 standard was first designed to be utilized in H. 324 based systems (PSTN and other circuit-switched network videoconferencing and videotelephony), but it also found use in H. 

Histone<====>14029<====>HistoneIn biology, histones are highly alkaline proteins found in eukaryotic cell nuclei that package and order the DNA into structural units called nucleosomes.   They are the chief protein components of chromatin, acting as spools around which DNA winds, and playing a role in gene regulation.  Without histones, the unwound DNA in chromosomes would be very long (a length to width ratio of more than 10 million to 1 in human DNA).  For example, each human diploid cell (containing 23 pairs of chromosomes) has about 1. 8 meters of DNA; wound on the histones, the dipliod cell has about 90 micrometers (0. 

Hierarchical organization<====>14031<====>Hierarchical organizationA hierarchical organization is an organizational structure where every entity in the organization, except one, is subordinate to a single other entity.  This arrangement is a form of a hierarchy.  In an organization, the hierarchy usually consists of a singular/group of power at the top with subsequent levels of power beneath them.  This is the dominant mode of organization among large organizations; most corporations, governments, and organized religions are hierarchical organizations with different levels of management, power or authority.  For example, the broad, top-level overview of the general organization of the Catholic Church consists of the Pope, then the Cardinals, then the Archbishops, and so on.

Most history paintings are not of scenes from history, especially paintings from before about 1850. In modern English, historical painting is sometimes used to describe the painting of scenes from history in its narrower sense, especially for 19th-century art, excluding religious, mythological and allegorical subjects, which are included in the broader term history painting, and before the 19th century were the most common subjects for history paintings. 

Hyperbola<====>14052<====>Hyperbola  In mathematics, a hyperbola (plural hyperbolas or hyperbolae) is a type of smooth curve lying in a plane, defined by its geometric properties or by equations for which it is the solution set.   A hyperbola has two pieces, called connected components or branches, that are mirror images of each other and resemble two infinite bows.   The hyperbola is one of the three kinds of conic section, formed by the intersection of a plane and a double cone.   (The other conic sections are the parabola and the ellipse.  A circle is a special case of an ellipse.

He first made a name for himself as a film producer, and then became an influential figure in the aviation industry.  Later in life, he became known for his eccentric behavior and reclusive lifestyle—oddities that were caused in part by a worsening obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), chronic pain from several plane crashes, and increasing deafness. As a maverick film tycoon, Hughes gained prominence in Hollywood beginning in the late 1920s, when he produced big-budget and often controversial films like The Racket (1928),  Hell's Angels (1930),  and Scarface (1932).

Hammered dulcimer<====>14070<====>Hammered dulcimer The hammered dulcimer is a percussion-stringed instrument which consists of strings typically stretched over a trapezoidal resonant sound board.  The hammered dulcimer is set before the musician, who, in more traditional styles, may sit cross legged on the floor, or at a more modern style of standing or sitting at a wooden stand on legs.  The player holds a small spoon shaped mallet hammer in each hand to strike the strings (cf.  Appalachian dulcimer).  The Graeco-Roman dulcimer (sweet song) derives from the Latin dulcis (sweet) and the Greek melos (song).

History of Wikipedia<====>14072<====>History of Wikipedia Wikipedia began with its launch on 15 January 2001, two days after the domain was registered  by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.  Its technological and conceptual underpinnings predate this; the earliest known proposal for an online encyclopedia was made by Rick Gates in 1993,    but the concept of a free-as-in-freedom online encyclopedia (as distinct from mere open source)  was proposed by Richard Stallman in December 2000.  Crucially, Stallman's concept specifically included the idea that no central organization should control editing.  This characteristic was in stark contrast to contemporary digital encyclopedias such as Microsoft Encarta, Encyclopædia Britannica, and even Bomis's Nupedia, which was Wikipedia's direct predecessor. 

Hydropower<====>14073<====>Hydropower   Hydropower or water power (from   , "water") is power derived from the energy of falling water or fast running water, which may be harnessed for useful purposes.  Since ancient times, hydropower from many kinds of watermills has been used as a renewable energy source for irrigation and the operation of various mechanical devices, such as gristmills, sawmills, textile mills, trip hammers, dock cranes, domestic lifts, and ore mills.  A trompe, which produces compressed air from falling water, is sometimes used to power other machinery at a distance.   In the late 19th century, hydropower became a source for generating electricity. 

Horse breed<====>14076<====>Horse breed A horse breed is a selectively bred population of domesticated horses, often with pedigrees recorded in a breed registry.   However, the term is sometimes used in a very broad sense to define landrace animals, or naturally selected horses of a common phenotype located within a limited geographic region.   Depending on definition, hundreds of "breeds"  exist today, developed for many different uses.   Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods," such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and "warmbloods," developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe.

Horse breeding<====>14082<====>Horse breeding Horse breeding is reproduction in horses, and particularly the human-directed process of selective breeding of animals, particularly purebred horses of a given breed.  Planned matings can be used to produce specifically desired characteristics in domesticated horses.   Furthermore, modern breeding management and technologies can increase the rate of conception, a healthy pregnancy, and successful foaling. TerminologyThe male parent of a horse, a stallion, is commonly known as the sire and the female parent, the mare, is called the dam.   Both are genetically important, as each parent provides half of the genetic makeup of the ensuing offspring, called a foal. 

Heterosexuality<====>14084<====>Heterosexuality   Heterosexuality is romantic attraction, sexual attraction or sexual behavior between persons of the opposite sex or gender.

Hull classification symbol<====>14090<====>Hull classification symbol   The United States Navy, United States Coast Guard, and United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) use a hull classification symbol (sometimes called hull code or hull number) to identify their ships by type and by individual ship within a type.   The system is analogous to the pennant number system that the Royal Navy and other European and Commonwealth navies use. HistoryUnited States NavyThe U. S.  Navy began to assign unique Naval Registry Identification Numbers to its ships in the 1890s.  The system was a simple one in which each ship received a number which was appended to its ship type, fully spelled out, and added parenthetically after the ship's name when deemed necessary to avoid confusion between ships. 

Habeas corpus<====>14091<====>Habeas corpus   Habeas corpus ( ; Medieval Latin meaning literally "that you have the body")  is a recourse in law through which a person can report an unlawful detention or imprisonment to a court and request that the court order the custodian of the person, usually a prison official, to bring the prisoner to court, to determine whether the detention is lawful.

Human cloning<====>14094<====>Human cloningHuman cloning is the creation of a genetically identical copy of a human.  The term is generally used to refer to artificial human cloning, which is the reproduction of human cells and tissue.  It does not refer to the natural conception and delivery of identical twins.  The possibility of human cloning has raised controversies.  These ethical concerns have prompted several nations to pass laws regarding human cloning and its legality. Two commonly discussed types of theoretical human cloning are: therapeutic cloning and reproductive cloning.  Therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells from a human for use in medicine and transplants, and is an active area of research, but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world,  . 

History of Asia<====>14097<====>History of Asia The history of Asia can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions such as, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe. The coastal periphery was the home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, with each of the three regions developing early civilizations around fertile river valleys.  These valleys were fertile because the soil there was rich and could bear many root crops.  The civilizations in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, and China shared many similarities and likely exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel. 

History of the Americas<====>14098<====>History of the AmericasThe prehistory of the Americas (North, South, and Central America, and the Caribbean) begins with people migrating to these areas from Asia during the height of an Ice Age.  These groups are generally believed to have been isolated from peoples of the "Old World" until the coming of Europeans in the 10th century from Norway and with the voyages of Christopher Columbus in 1492. The ancestors of today's American Indigenous peoples were the Paleo-Indians; they were hunter-gatherers who migrated into North America.  The most popular theory asserts that migrants came to the Americas via Beringia, the land mass now covered by the ocean waters of the Bering Strait. 

History of Africa<====>14099<====>History of AfricaThe history of Africa begins with the emergence of Homo sapiens in East Africa, and continues into the present as a patchwork of diverse and politically developing nation states.  The recorded history of early civilization arose in the Kingdom of Kush,  and later in Ancient Egypt, the Sahel, the Maghreb and the Horn of Africa.  During the Middle Ages, Islam spread west from Arabia to Egypt, crossing the Maghreb and the Sahel.  Some notable pre-colonial states and societies in Africa include the Ajuran Empire, D'mt, Adal Sultanate, Warsangali Sultanate, Kingdom of Nri, Nok culture, Mali Empire, Songhai Empire, Benin Empire, Ashanti Empire, Ghana Empire, Mossi Kingdoms, Mutapa Empire, Kingdom of Mapungubwe, Kingdom of Sine, Kingdom of Sennar, Kingdom of Saloum, Kingdom of Baol, Kingdom of Cayor, Kingdom of Zimbabwe, Kingdom of Kongo, Empire of Kaabu, Ancient Carthage, Numidia, Mauretania, and the Aksumite Empire. 

History of Oceania<====>14104<====>History of Oceania   The History of Oceania includes the history of Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and other Pacific island nations. PrehistoryPolynesia theories The Polynesian people are considered to be by linguistic, archaeological and human genetic ancestry a subset of the sea-migrating Austronesian people and tracing Polynesian languages places their prehistoric origins in the Malay Archipelago, and ultimately, in Taiwan.  Between about 3000 and 1000 BC speakers of Austronesian languages began spreading from Taiwan into Island South-East Asia,   as tribes whose natives were thought to have arrived through South China about 8,000 years ago to the edges of western Micronesia and on into Melanesia, although they are different from the Han Chinese who now form the majority of people in China and Taiwan. 

Hanseatic League<====>14105<====>Hanseatic League   The Hanseatic League (also known as the Hanse or Hansa; Middle Low German: Hanse, Deutsche Hanse,   or  ); Dutch: Hanze, was a commercial and defensive confederation of merchant guilds and their market towns.   Growing from a few North German towns in the late 1100s, the league came to dominate Baltic maritime trade for three centuries along the coast of Northern Europe.  It stretched from the Baltic to the North Sea and inland during the Late Middle Ages and declined slowly after 1450. Hanse, later spelled as Hansa, was the Middle Low German word for a convoy, and this word was applied to bands of merchants traveling between the Hanseatic cities whether by land or by sea.

Horror fiction<====>14109<====>Horror fiction "Supernatural horror" redirects here.  For the film genre, see supernatural horror film.   Horror is a genre of fiction which is intended to, or has the capacity to frighten, scare, disgust, or startle its readers or viewers by inducing feelings of horror and terror.  Literary historian J.  A.  Cuddon has defined the horror story as "a piece of fiction in prose of variable length. . .  which shocks or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing".   It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere.  Horror is frequently supernatural, though it can be non-supernatural. 

Holomorphic function<====>14110<====>Holomorphic function  In mathematics, a holomorphic function is a complex-valued function of one or more complex variables that is complex differentiable in a neighborhood of every point in its domain.  The existence of a complex derivative in a neighborhood is a very strong condition, for it implies that any holomorphic function is actually infinitely differentiable and equal to its own Taylor series (analytic).  Holomorphic functions are the central objects of study in complex analysis. Though the term analytic function is often used interchangeably with "holomorphic function", the word "analytic" is defined in a broader sense to denote any function (real, complex, or of more general type) that can be written as a convergent power series in a neighborhood of each point in its domain. 

History of Algeria<====>14113<====>History of Algeria Much of the history of Algeria has taken place on the fertile coastal plain of North Africa, which is often called the Maghreb (or Maghrib).  North Africa served as a transit region for people moving towards Europe or the Middle East, thus, the region's inhabitants have been influenced by populations from other areas, including the Carthaginians, Romans, and Vandals.  The region was conquered by the Muslims in the early 8th century AD, but broke off from the Umayyad Caliphate after the Berber Revolt of 740.  Later, various Berbers, Arabs, Persian Muslim states, Sunni, Shia or Ibadi communities were established that ruled parts of modern-day of Algeria: including the Rustamids, Ifranids, Fatimids, Maghrawas, Zirids, Hammadids, Almoravid, Almohads, Hafsids, and Ziyyanids. 

History of Zimbabwe<====>14114<====>History of Zimbabwe    Following the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979 there was a transition to internationally recognized majority rule in 1980; the United Kingdom ceremonially granted Zimbabwe independence on 18 April that year.  In the 2000s Zimbabwe's economy began to deteriorate due to various factors, including, the imposition of economic sanctions by western countries led by the United Kingdom, and also due to wide spread corruption in government.  Economic instability caused a lot of Zimbabweans to move overseas or to neighboring countrys.  Prior to its recognized independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, the nation had been known by several names: Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia and Zimbabwe Rhodesia. 

History of Russia<====>14115<====>History of Russia The History of Russia begins with that of the East Slavs.The traditional beginning of Russian history is 862 A. D.  Kievan Rus', the first united East Slavic state, was founded in 882.  The state adopted Christianity from the Byzantine Empire in 988, beginning with the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Slavic culture for the next millennium.  Kievan Rus' ultimately disintegrated as a state because of the Mongol invasion of Rus' in 1237–1240 and the death of about half the population of Rus'. After the 13th century, Moscow became a cultural center of Moscovia. 

History of Christianity<====>14117<====>History of Christianity   The history of Christianity concerns the Christian religion, Christendom, and the Church with its various denominations, from the 1st century to the present. Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christianity spread to all of Europe in the Middle Ages.  Christianity expanded throughout the world and became the world's largest religion due to European colonialism.   Today there are more than two billion Christians worldwide.  Early Christianity (c.  31/33–324)   During its early history, Christianity grew from a 1st-century Jewish following to a religion that existed across the entire Greco-Roman world and beyond. 

Hertz<====>14121<====>Hertz    The hertz (symbol: Hz) is the derived unit of frequency in the International System of Units (SI) and is defined as one cycle per second.   It is named for Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, the first person to provide conclusive proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves.  Hertz are commonly expressed in multiples: kilohertz (10 3  Hz, kHz), megahertz (10 6  Hz, MHz), gigahertz (10 9  Hz, GHz), and terahertz (10 12  Hz, THz). Some of the unit's most common uses are in the description of sine waves and musical tones, particularly those used in radio- and audio-related applications. 

Heroic couplet<====>14123<====>Heroic coupletA heroic couplet is a traditional form for English poetry, commonly used in  epic and narrative poetry, and consisting of a rhyming pair of lines in iambic pentameter.   Use of the heroic couplet was pioneered by Geoffrey Chaucer in the Legend of Good Women and the Canterbury Tales, Hobsbaum, Philip.  Metre, Rhythm and Verse Form.   Routledge (1996) p. 23  and generally considered to have been perfected by John Dryden in the Restoration Age. ExampleA frequently-cited example illustrating the use of heroic couplets is this passage from Cooper's Hill by John Denham, part of his description of the Thames:O could I flow like thee, and make thy streamMy great example, as it is my theme!Though deep yet clear, though gentle yet not dull;Strong without rage, without o'erflowing full. 

Höðr<====>14127<====>HöðrHöðr (Old Norse: Hǫðr [hɔðr]; often anglicized as Hod, Hoder, or Hodur ) is a blind god, the twin brother of Baldr and a son of Odin and Frigg in Norse mythology.  Tricked and guided by Loki, he shot the mistletoe arrow which was to slay the otherwise invulnerable Baldr. According to the Prose Edda and the Poetic Edda, the goddess Frigg, Baldr's mother, made everything in existence swear never to harm Baldr, except for the mistletoe, which she found too unimportant to ask (alternatively, which she found too young to demand an oath from).  The gods amused themselves by trying weapons on Baldr and seeing them fail to do any harm. 

Herat<====>14128<====>Herat {{Infobox settlement  }}Herat ( ;   , Herât;  ;  , Alexándreia hē en Aríois;  ) is the third-largest city of Afghanistan.  It has a population of about 436,300,  and serves as the capital of Herat Province, situated in the fertile valley of the Hari River.  It is linked with Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif via Highway 1 or the ring road.  It is further linked to the city of Mashhad in neighboring Iran through the border town of Islam Qala, and to Turkmenistan through the border town of Torghundi, both about   away. 

Hedeby<====>14130<====>Hedeby  Hedeby ( , Old Norse Heiðabýr, German Haithabu) was an important Viking Age (8th to the 11th centuries) trading settlement near the southern end of the Jutland Peninsula, now in the Schleswig-Flensburg district of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.  It is  the most important archaeological site in Schleswig-Holstein.  The settlement developed as a trading centre at the head of a narrow, navigable inlet known as the Schlei, which connects to the Baltic Sea.  The location was favorable because there is a short portage of less than 15 km to the Treene River, which flows into the Eider with its North Sea estuary, making it a convenient place where goods and ships could be pulled on a corduroy road overland for an almost uninterrupted seaway between the Baltic and the North Sea and avoid a dangerous and time-consuming circumnavigation of Jutland, providing Hedeby with a role similar to later Lübeck. 

Hazaras<====>14131<====>Hazaras    The Hazaras ( ,  ) are an ethnic group native to the region of Hazarajat in central Afghanistan, speaking the Hazaragi variant of Dari,itself an eastern variety of Persian and one of the two official languages of Afghanistan. They are overwhelmingly Twelver Shia Muslims and make up the third largest ethnic group in Afghanistan.  They also make up a significant minority group in the neighboring Pakistan, with a population of over 650,000–900,000,   largely living in the region of Quetta. 

Hawala<====>14132<====>Hawala  Hawala or hewala ( , meaning transfer or sometimes trust), also known as hundi or — in Somali, xawala or xawilaad    — is a popular and informal value transfer system based  not on the movement of cash, or on telegraph or computer network wire transfers between banks, but instead on the performance and honour of a huge network of money brokers  (known as "hawaladars").  While hawaladars are spread throughout the world, they are primarily located in the Middle East, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and the Indian subcontinent, operating outside of, or parallel to, traditional banking, financial channels, and remittance systems. 

Hydroponics<====>14133<====>Hydroponics Hydroponics is a subset of hydroculture, the method of growing plants without soil, using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent.  Santos, J.  D.  et al (2013) Development of a vinasse nutritive solutions for hydroponics.  Journal of Environmental Management 114: 8-12.    Terrestrial plants may be grown with only their roots exposed to the mineral solution, or the roots may be supported by an inert medium, such as perlite or gravel.  The nutrients in hydroponics can come from an array of different sources; these can include but are not limited to byproduct from fish waste, duck manure, or normal nutrients. 

Henry Purcell<====>14135<====>Henry Purcell   Henry Purcell (  or  ;  c.  10 September 1659 According to Holman and Thompson (Grove Music Online, see References) there is uncertainty regarding the year and day of birth.  No record of baptism has been found.  The year 1659 is based on Purcell's memorial tablet in Westminster Abbey and the frontispiece of his Sonnata's of III.  Parts (London, 1683).  The day 10 September is based on vague inscriptions in the manuscript GB-Cfm 88.  It may also be relevant that he was appointed to his first salaried post on 10 September 1677, which would have been his eighteenth birthday. 

Hydrophobe<====>14136<====>Hydrophobe In chemistry, hydrophobicity is the physical property of a molecule (known as a hydrophobe) that is seemingly repelled from a mass of water.   (Strictly speaking, there is no repulsive force involved; it is an absence of attraction. ) In contrast, hydrophiles are attracted to water. Hydrophobic molecules tend to be nonpolar and, thus, prefer other neutral molecules and nonpolar solvents.  Because water molecules are polar, hydrophobes do not dissolve well among them.  Hydrophobic molecules in water often cluster together, forming micelles.  Water on hydrophobic surfaces will exhibit a high contact angle. Examples of hydrophobic molecules include the alkanes, oils, fats, and greasy substances in general. 

Harley-Davidson<====>14142<====>Harley-Davidson   Harley-Davidson, Inc.  (H-D), or Harley, is an American motorcycle manufacturer, founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1903. One of two major American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the Great Depression (along with Indian), Automotive – RSS Feed  .  Popularmechanics. com.  Retrieved on July 7, 2011.   the company has survived numerous ownership arrangements, subsidiary arrangements (e. g. ,  Aermacchi 1974-1978 and Buell 1987-2009), periods of poor economic health and product quality, as well as intense global competition,    to become one of the world's largest motorcycle manufacturers and an iconic brand widely known for its loyal following. 

Hiberno-English<====>14144<====>Hiberno-English  Hiberno‐English (from Latin Hibernia: "Ireland") or Irish English  is the set of English dialects natively written and spoken within the island of Ireland (including both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland).  English was brought to Ireland as a result of the Norman invasion of Ireland of the late 12th century.  Initially, it was mainly spoken in an area known as the Pale around Dublin, with mostly Irish spoken throughout the rest of the country.  By the Tudor period, Irish culture and language had regained most of the territory lost to the invaders: even in the Pale, "all the common folk… for the most part are of Irish birth, Irish habit, and of Irish language". 

Harmonic analysis<====>14147<====>Harmonic analysis Harmonic analysis is a branch of mathematics concerned with the representation of functions or signals as the superposition of basic waves, and the study of and generalization of the notions of Fourier series and Fourier transforms (i. e.  an extended form of Fourier analysis).  In the past two centuries, it has become a vast subject with applications in areas as diverse as number theory, representation theory, signal processing, quantum mechanics, tidal analysis and neuroscience. The term "harmonics" originated as the Ancient Greek word harmonikos, meaning "skilled in music. "  In physical eigenvalue problems it began to mean waves whose frequencies are integer multiples of one another, as are the frequencies of the harmonics of music notes, but the term has been generalized beyond its original meaning. 

Home run<====>14148<====>Home run In baseball, a home run (abbreviated HR) is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process.  In modern baseball, the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles (or making contact with either foul pole) without first touching the ground,    resulting in an automatic home run.   There is also the "inside-the-park" home run, increasingly rare in modern baseball, where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field. 

Harappa<====>14149<====>Harappa    Harappa ( ; Urdu/ ) is an archaeological site in Punjab, Pakistan, about   west of Sahiwal.  The site takes its name from a modern village located near the former course of the Ravi River which now runs   in north.  The current village of Harappa is less than   from the ancient site.  Although modern Harappa has a legacy railway station from the period of the British Raj, it is today just a small crossroads town of population 15,000. The site of the ancient city contains the ruins of a Bronze Age fortified city, which was part of the Indus Valley Civilization centered in Sindh and the Punjab, and then the Cemetery H culture. 

Hendecasyllable<====>14153<====>HendecasyllableThe hendecasyllable is a line of eleven syllables, used in Ancient Greek and Latin quantitative verse as well as in medieval and modern European poetry. In quantitative verse The classical hendecasyllable is a quantitative meter used in Ancient Greece in Aeolic verse and in scolia, and later by the Roman poets Catullus and Martial.   Each line has eleven syllables; hence the name, which comes from the Greek word for eleven.  Finch, Annie.  A Poet's Craft.  Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2012, p.  410   The heart of the line is the choriamb (- u u -). 

Hebrides<====>14155<====>Hebrides   The Hebrides ( ;  ,  ;  ) comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland.  There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides.  These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples.  This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times. The Hebrides are the source of much of Scottish Gaelic literature and Gaelic music. 

HMS Dreadnought<====>14158<====>HMS Dreadnought  Several ships and one submarine of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS Dreadnought in the expectation that they would "dread nought", i. e.  "fear nothing".  The 1906 ship was one of the Royal Navy's most famous vessels; battleships built after her were referred to as 'dreadnoughts', and earlier battleships became known as pre-dreadnoughts.   was a 40-gun  built in 1553.    was a 41-gun ship launched in 1573, rebuilt in 1592 and 1614, then broken up in 1648.   was a 52-gun third-rate ship of the line launched in 1654 as the Torrington for the Commonwealth of England Navy, renamed Dreadnought at the Restoration in 1660, and lost in 1690. 

Hartmann Schedel<====>14159<====>Hartmann Schedel Hartmann Schedel (13 February 1440 – 28 November 1514) was a German physician, humanist, historian, and one of the first cartographers to use the printing press.  He was born and died in Nuremberg.   Matheolus Perusinus served as his tutor.  Schedel is best known for his writing the text for the Nuremberg Chronicle, known as Schedelsche Weltchronik (English: Schedel's World Chronicle), published in 1493 in Nuremberg.   It was commissioned by Sebald Schreyer (1446 – 1520) and Sebastian Kammermeister (1446 – 1503).    Maps in the Chronicle were the first ever illustrations of many cities and countries. 

Hexameter<====>14160<====>HexameterHexameter is a metrical line of verses consisting of six feet.  It was the standard epic metre in classical Greek and Latin literature, such as in the Iliad, Odyssey and Aeneid.  Its use in other genres of composition include Horace's satires, Ovid's Metamorphoses, and the Hymns of Orpheus.  According to Greek mythology, hexameter was invented by Phemonoe, daughter of Apollo and the first Pythia of Delphi.   Classical HexameterIn classical hexameter, the six feet follow these rules:A foot can be made up of two long syllables (– –), a spondee; or a long and two short syllables, a dactyl (– υ υ).

The large number of extinctions spans numerous families of plants and animals, including mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and arthropods.  With widespread degradation of highly biodiverse habitats such as coral reefs and rainforest, as well as other areas, the vast majority of these extinctions is thought to be undocumented.  The current rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than natural background rates. 

Hollywood-style Lindy Hop<====>14209<====>Hollywood-style Lindy Hop Hollywood-style Lindy Hop is a variety of Lindy Hop, an American vernacular dance.  It is also sometimes referred to as Dean Collins or Smooth-style, but these terms also sometimes refer to different styles of Lindy Hop. Hollywood is the style reconstructed by Erik Robison and Sylvia Skylar based on movies from 1930s and 1940s featuring dancers like Dean Collins, Jewel McGowan, Jean Veloz and others.  .  They were the first to call it "Hollywood Style".    The swingout (the basic step of Lindy) is danced in a position often described as someone about to sit on a stool, thereby bringing their center point of balance closer to the ground. 

Harrison Narcotics Tax Act<====>14210<====>Harrison Narcotics Tax Act  The Harrison Narcotics Tax Act (Ch.  1,  ) was a United States federal law that regulated and taxed the production, importation, and distribution of opiates and coca products.  The act was proposed by Representative Francis Burton Harrison of New York and was approved on December 17, 1914.  "An Act To provide for the registration of, with collectors of internal revenue, and to impose a special tax on all persons who produce, import, manufacture, compound, deal in, dispense, sell, distribute, or give away opium or coca leaves, their salts, derivatives, or preparations, and for other purposes. 

Horse tack<====>14215<====>Horse tack Tack is a piece of equipment or accessory equipped on horses in the course of their use as domesticated animals.  Saddles, stirrups, bridles, halters, reins, bits, harnesses, martingales, and breastplates are all forms of horse tack.  Equipping a horse is often referred to as tacking up.  A room to store such equipment, usually near or in a stable, is a tack room. Saddles Saddles  are seats for the rider, fastened to the horse's back by means of a girth (English-style riding), known as a cinch in the Western US, a wide strap that goes around the horse at a point about four inches behind the forelegs. 

Hausa language<====>14216<====>Hausa language Hausa ( )  (Yaren Hausa or Harshen Hausa) is the Chadic language (a branch of the Afroasiatic language family) with the largest number of speakers, spoken as a first language by some 27 million people, and as a second language by another 20 million.  The ancestral language of the Hausa people, one of the largest ethnic groups in Central Africa, Hausa is commonly spoken throughout southern Niger and northern Nigeria.  It has developed into a lingua franca across much of Western  Africa for purposes of trade. Classification Hausa belongs to the West Chadic languages subgroup of the Chadic languages group, which in turn is part of the Afroasiatic language family. 

History of mathematics<====>14220<====>History of mathematicsThe area of study known as the history of mathematics is primarily an investigation into the origin of discoveries in mathematics and, to a lesser extent, an investigation into the mathematical methods and notation of the past.  Before the modern age and the worldwide spread of knowledge, written examples of new mathematical developments have come to light only in a few locales.  From 3000 BC the Mesopotamian states of Sumer, Akkad and Assyria, together with Ancient Egypt and Ebla began using arithmetic, algebra and geometry for purposes of taxation, commerce, trade and also in the field of astronomy and to formulate calendars and record time. 

Hydrogen atom<====>14225<====>Hydrogen atom    A hydrogen atom is an atom of the chemical element hydrogen.  The electrically neutral atom contains a single positively charged proton and a single negatively charged electron bound to the nucleus by the Coulomb force.  Atomic hydrogen constitutes about 75% of the baryonic mass of the universe.    In everyday life on Earth, isolated hydrogen atoms (called "atomic hydrogen") are extremely rare.  Instead, hydrogen tends to combine with other atoms in compounds, or with itself to form ordinary (diatomic) hydrogen gas, H 2 .  "Atomic hydrogen" and "hydrogen atom" in ordinary English use have overlapping, yet distinct, meanings. 

Elagabalus<====>14227<====>Elagabalus   Elagabalus  , also known as Heliogabalus ( ;   203 – March 11, 222), was Roman emperor from 218 to 222.  A member of the Severan dynasty, he was Syrian, the second son of Julia Soaemias and Sextus Varius Marcellus.  In his early youth he served as a priest of the god Elagabalus in the hometown of his mother's family, Emesa.  As a private citizen, he was probably named Sextus Varius Avitus Bassianus.   Upon becoming emperor he took the name Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus.  He was called Elagabalus only after his death. 

Homeopathy<====>14229<====>HomeopathyHomeopathy is a system of alternative medicine created in 1796 by Samuel Hahnemann, based on his doctrine of like cures like (similia similibus curentur), a claim that a substance that causes the symptoms of a disease in healthy people would cure similar symptoms in sick people.   Homeopathy is a pseudoscience – a belief that is incorrectly presented as scientific.  Homeopathic preparations are not effective for treating any condition;large-scale studies have found homeopathy to be no more effective than a placebo, indicating that any positive effects that follow treatment are only due to the placebo effect, normal recovery from illness, or regression toward the mean. 

Hairpin<====>14231<====>Hairpin A hair pin or hairpin is a long device used to hold a person's hair in place.  It may be used simply to secure long hair out of the way for convenience or as part of an elaborate hairstyle or coiffure.   The earliest evidence for dressing the hair may be seen in carved "venus figurines" such as the Venus of Brassempouy and the Venus of Willendorf.  The creation of different hairstyles, especially among women, seems to be common to all cultures and all periods and many past, and current, societies use hairpins. Hairpins made of metal, ivory, bronze, carved wood, etc. 

Hate speech<====>14233<====>Hate speech  Hate speech is speech which attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender.    In the law of some countries, hate speech is described as speech, gesture or conduct, writing, or display which is forbidden because it incites violence or prejudicial action against a protected group, or individual on the basis of their membership of the group, or because it disparages or intimidates a protected group, or individual on the basis of their membership of the group.  The law may identify a protected group by certain characteristics. 

Henrik Ibsen<====>14236<====>Henrik Ibsen    Henrik Johan Ibsen ( ;   ; 20 March 1828 – 23 May 1906) was a major 19th-century Norwegian playwright, theatre director, and poet.  He is often referred to as "the father of realism" and is one of the founders of Modernism in theatre.   His major works include Brand, Peer Gynt, An Enemy of the People, Emperor and Galilean, A Doll's House, Hedda Gabler, Ghosts, The Wild Duck, When We Dead Awaken, Pillars of Society, The Lady from the Sea, Rosmersholm, The Master Builder, and John Gabriel Borkman.  He is the most frequently performed dramatist in the world after Shakespeare,   and by the early 20th century A Doll's House became the world's most performed play. 

Hawaiian language<====>14240<====>Hawaiian language The Hawaiian language (Hawaiian:  ,  )  is a Polynesian language that takes its name from Hawai i, the largest island in the tropical North Pacific archipelago where it developed.  Hawaiian, along with English, is an official language of the State of Hawaii.  King Kamehameha III established the first Hawaiian-language constitution in 1839 and 1840. For various reasons, including territorial legislation establishing English as the official language in schools, the number of native speakers of Hawaiian gradually decreased during the period from the 1830s to the 1950s.  Hawaiian was essentially displaced by English on six of seven inhabited islands. 

Second Polish Republic<====>14245<====>Second Polish Republic   The Second Polish Republic, commonly known as interwar Poland, refers to the country of Poland between the First and Second World Wars (1918–1939).  Officially known as the Republic of Poland ( ), the Polish state was recreated in 1918, in the aftermath of World War I.  When, after several regional conflicts, the borders of the state were fixed in 1922, Poland's neighbours were Czechoslovakia, Germany, the Free City of Danzig, Lithuania, Latvia, Romania and the Soviet Union.  It had access to the Baltic Sea via a short strip of coastline either side of the city of Gdynia. 

HMS Resolution<====>14251<====>HMS Resolution Several ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS Resolution.  However, the first English warship to bear the name Resolution was actually the first rate Prince Royal (built in 1610 and rebuilt in 1641), which was renamed Resolution in 1650 following the inauguration of the Commonwealth, and continued to bear that name until 1660, when the name Prince Royal was restored.  The name Resolution was bestowed on the first of the vessels listed below:Resolution (1654), a 50-gun third-rate frigate launched 1654 as Tredagh; renamed Resolution 1660; destroyed after grounding by a Dutch fireship in the St James's Day Battle 4 August 1666. 

Helen Keller<====>14254<====>Helen Keller    Helen Adams Keller (June 27, 1880 – June 1, 1968) was an American author, political activist, and lecturer.  She was the first deaf-blind person to earn a bachelor of arts degree.  The story of how Keller's teacher, Anne Sullivan, broke through the isolation imposed by a near complete lack of language, allowing the girl to blossom as she learned to communicate, has become widely known through the dramatic depictions of the play and film The Miracle Worker.  Her birthplace in West Tuscumbia, Alabama, is now a museum    and sponsors an annual "Helen Keller Day". 

Haddocks' Eyes<====>14257<====>Haddocks' Eyes  Haddocks' Eyes is a term for the name of a poem by Lewis Carroll from Through the Looking-Glass.  It is sung by The White Knight in   to a tune that he claims as his own invention, but which Alice recognises as "I give thee all, I can no more". By the time Alice heard it, she was already tired of poetry. It parodies the plot, but not the style or metre, of "Resolution and Independence" by William Wordsworth.   NamingThe White Knight explains a confusing nomenclature for the song. The song's name is called Haddocks' EyesThe song's name is The Aged Aged ManThe song is called Ways and MeansThe song is A-sitting on a GateThe complicated terminology distinguishing between 'the song, what the song is called, the name of the song, and what the name of the song is called' both uses and mentions the use–mention distinction.

Hoosier<====>14260<====>Hoosier Hoosier   is the official demonym for a resident of the U. S.  state of Indiana.  The origin of the term remains a matter of debate within the state,  but "Hoosier" was in general use by the 1840s,  having been popularized by Richmond resident John Finley's 1833    poem "The Hoosier's Nest".  Anyone born in Indiana or a resident at the time is considered to be a Hoosier.  Finley, John.  The Hoosier's Nest and Other Poems, pp.  11–17.  Moore, Wilstach, & Baldwin (Cincinnati), 1866.

Horner's method<====>14263<====>Horner's methodIn mathematics, Horner's method (also known as Horner scheme in the UK or Horner's rule in the U. S.   .) is either of two things:an algorithm for calculating polynomials, which consists of transforming the monomial form into a computationally efficient form;  ora method for approximating the roots of a polynomial.    The latter is also known as Ruffini–Horner's method.  These methods are named after the British mathematician William George Horner, although they were known before him by Paolo Ruffini  .   and, six hundred years earlier, by the Chinese mathematician Qin Jiushao. 

Hapworth 16, 1924<====>14268<====>Hapworth 16, 1924"Hapworth 16, 1924" was the last original work of Salinger's to be published in his lifetime.  It appeared in the June 19, 1965, edition of The New Yorker, infamously taking up almost the entire magazine.  It is the "youngest" of J.  D.  Salinger's Glass family stories, in the sense that the narrated events happen chronologically before those in the rest of the "Glass series".    Both contemporary and later literary critics harshly panned "Hapworth 16, 1924"; writing in The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani called it "a sour, implausible and, sad to say, completely charmless story . 

Hypnotic<====>14269<====>Hypnotic   Hypnotic (from Greek Hypnos, sleep) or soporific drugs, commonly known as sleeping pills, are a class of psychoactive drugs whose primary function is to induce sleep    and to be used in the treatment of insomnia (sleeplessness), or surgical anesthesia.  When used in anesthesia to produce and maintain unconsciousness, "sleep" is metaphorical as there are no regular sleep stages or cyclical natural states; patients rarely recover from anesthesia feeling refreshed and with renewed energy.  This group is related to sedatives.  Where as the term sedative describes drugs that serve to calm or relieve anxiety, the term hypnotic generally describes drugs whose main purpose is to initiate, sustain, or lengthen sleep. 

HMS Dunraven<====>14273<====>HMS Dunraven  }   HMS Dunraven was a Q-Ship of the Royal Navy during World War I. On 8 August 1917,  130 miles southwest of Ushant in the Bay of Biscay, disguised as the collier Boverton and commanded by Gordon Campbell, VC, Dunraven spotted  , commanded by Oberleutnant zur See Reinhold Saltzwedel.   Saltzwedel believed the disguised ship was a merchant vessel.   The U-boat submerged and closed with Dunraven before surfacing astern at 11:43 am and opening fire at long range.   Dunraven made smoke and sent off a panic party (a small number of men who "abandon ship" during an attack to continue the impersonation of a merchant). 

Hacker ethic<====>14275<====>Hacker ethic   Hacker ethic is a term for the moral values and philosophy that are common in hacker culture.  In other words, those who possess positive hacker ethic acknowledge that sharing information and data responsibly is very beneficial and helpful.   Whilst the philosophy originated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1950s–1960s, the term hacker ethic is attributed to journalist Steven Levy as described in his 1984 book titled Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution.  The key points within this ethic are access, freedom of information, and improvement to quality of life.  While some tenets of hacker ethic were described in other texts like Computer Lib/Dream Machines (1974) by Ted Nelson, Levy appears to have been the first to document both the philosophy and the founders of the philosophy. 

Hotel<====>14276<====>Hotel  A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis.  Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a refrigerator and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flatscreen television and en-suite bathrooms.  Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities.  Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa and social function services. 

Hugh Hefner<====>14279<====>Hugh Hefner   Hugh Marston Hefner (April 9, 1926 – September 27, 2017) was an American businessman, magazine publisher and playboy.  He was the founder of Playboy and editor-in-chief of the magazine, which he founded in 1953.   He was also the chief creative officer of Playboy Enterprises, which is the publishing group that operates the magazine.   An advocate of sexual liberation and freedom of expression, Hefner was a political activist and philanthropist in several other causes and public issues. Early lifeHefner was born during the Prohibition era in Chicago, Illinois, on April 9, 1926.He was the first child of Grace Caroline (née Swanson; 1895–1997) who worked as a teacher, and Glenn Lucius Hefner (1896–1976), an accountant. 

Hafizullah Amin<====>14280<====>Hafizullah Amin  Hafizullah Amin (Pashto/ ; born 1 August 1929 – 27 December 1979) was an Afghan politician during the Cold War.  Amin was born in Paghman and educated at Kabul University, after which he started his career as a teacher.  After a few years in that occupation, he went to the United States to study.  He would visit the United States a second time before moving permanently to Afghanistan, and starting his career in radical politics.  He ran as a candidate in the 1965 parliamentary election but failed to secure a seat.  Amin was the only Khalqist elected to parliament in the 1969 parliamentary election, thus increasing his standing within the party. 

Hubris<====>14282<====>Hubris  Hubris (  from ancient Greek  ) describes a personality quality of extreme or foolish pride or dangerous overconfidence,  often in combination with (or synonymous with) arrogance. In its ancient Greek context, it typically describes behavior that defies the norms of behavior or challenges the gods, and which in turn brings about the downfall, or nemesis, of the perpetrator of hubris. The adjectival form of the noun hubris is "hubristic".  Hubris is usually perceived as a characteristic of an individual rather than a group, although the group the offender belongs to may suffer collateral consequences from the wrongful act. 

Heavy water<====>14283<====>Heavy water   Heavy water (deuterium oxide,  ,  ) is a form of water that contains a larger than normal amount of the hydrogen isotope deuterium (  or D, also known as heavy hydrogen), rather than the common hydrogen-1 isotope (  or H, also called protium) that makes up most of the hydrogen in normal water.   The presence of deuterium gives the chemical different nuclear properties, and the increase of mass gives it different physical and chemical properties compared to normal "light water". ExplanationDeuterium is a hydrogen isotope with a nucleus containing a neutron and a proton; the nucleus of a protium (normal hydrogen) atom consists of just a proton. 

History of science and technology<====>14285<====>History of science and technology The history of science and technology (HST) is a field of history which examines how humanity's understanding of the natural world (science) and ability to manipulate it (technology) have changed over the centuries.   This academic discipline also studies the cultural, economic, and political impacts of scientific innovation. Histories of science were originally written by practicing and retired scientists, starting primarily with William Whewell, as a way to communicate the virtues of science to the public.  In the early 1930s, after a famous paper given by the Soviet historian Boris Hessen, was focused into looking at the ways in which scientific practices were allied with the needs and motivations of their context. 

Holographic principle<====>14286<====>Holographic principle  The holographic principle is a principle of string theories and a supposed property of quantum gravity that states that the description of a volume of space can be thought of as encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary to the region—preferably a light-like boundary like a gravitational horizon.  First proposed by Gerard 't Hooft, it was given a precise string-theory interpretation by Leonard Susskind    who combined his ideas with previous ones of 't Hooft and Charles Thorn.    As pointed out by Raphael Bousso,  Thorn observed in 1978 that string theory admits a lower-dimensional description in which gravity emerges from it in what would now be called a holographic way. 

Hamilton, Ontario<====>14288<====>Hamilton, Ontario  Hamilton ( ; 2016 population 536,917; UA population 683,645; CMA population 778,400)  is a port city in the Canadian province of Ontario.  Conceived by George Hamilton when he purchased the Durand farm shortly after the War of 1812,    Hamilton has become the centre of a densely populated and industrialized region at the west end of Lake Ontario known as the Golden Horseshoe.  On January 1, 2001, the new City of Hamilton was formed through the amalgamation of the former city and the other constituent lower-tier municipalities of the Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth with the upper-tier regional government. 

Hussites<====>14291<====>Hussites   The Hussites (  or Kališníci; "Chalice People") were a pre-Protestant Christian movement that followed the teachings of Czech reformer Jan Hus, who became the best known representative of the Bohemian Reformation.  Hussite movement began in the Kingdom of Bohemia and quickly spread throughout the remaining Lands of the Bohemian Crown, including Moravia and Silesia.  It also made inroads into the northern parts of the Kingdom of Hungary (now Slovakia), but was rejected and gained infamy for plundering behavior of Hussite soldiers.

Herman of Alaska<====>14293<====>Herman of Alaska Saint Herman of Alaska ( ;   1750s – November 15, 1836) was a Russian Orthodox monk and missionary to Alaska, which was then part of Russian America.  His gentle approach and ascetic life earned him the love and respect of both the native Alaskans and the Russian colonists.  He is considered by many Orthodox Christians as the patron saint of North America.  Walsh, p.  261.  Early lifeBiographers disagree about Herman’s early life.  His official biography, which Valaam Monastery published in 1867, said that his pre-monastic name was unknown, but that Herman was born into a merchant’s family in Serpukhov, a city in Moscow Governorate. 

Hausdorff dimension<====>14294<====>Hausdorff dimensionHausdorff dimension is a measure of roughness in mathematics introduced in 1918 by mathematician Felix Hausdorff, and it serves as a measure of the local size of a space, taking into account the distance between its points.   Applying its mathematical formalisms provides that the Hausdorff dimension of a single point is zero, of a line is 1, of a square is 2, and of a cube is 3.  That is, for sets of points that define a smooth shape or a shape that has a small number of corners—the shapes of traditional geometry and science—the Hausdorff dimension is an integer agreeing with a dimension corresponding to its topology. 

Heckler & Koch<====>14296<====>Heckler & Koch Heckler & Koch GmbH (HK) ( ) is a German defense manufacturing company that manufactures handguns, assault rifles, submachine guns, and grenade launchers.  The company is located in Oberndorf in the state of Baden-Württemberg, and also has subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, France and the United States.

Henry Middleton<====>14298<====>Henry Middleton  Henry Middleton (1717 – June 13, 1784) was a planter and public official from South Carolina.  A member of the colonial legislature, during the American Revolution he attended the Continental Congress and served as that body's presiding officer for a few days in 1774.  He left Congress before it declared independence.  Back in South Carolina, he served as president of the provincial congress and senator in the newly created state government.  After his capture by the British in 1780, he accepted defeat and returned to the status of a British subject until the end of the war. 

Ham<====>14299<====>Ham  Ham is pork that has been preserved through salting, smoking, or wet curing.   It was traditionally made only from the hind leg of swine, and referred to that specific cut of pork.  "Bacon: Bacon and Ham Curing" in Chambers's Encyclopædia.  London: George Newnes, 1961, Vol.  2, p.  39.   Ham is made around the world, including a number of highly coveted regional specialties, such as Westphalian ham and some varieties of Spanish jamón.  Technically a processed meat, "ham" may refer to a product which has been through mechanical re-forming. The precise nature of meat termed "ham" is controlled in a number of areas, often by statute, including the United States and European Union. 

Henry Laurens<====>14300<====>Henry Laurens   Henry Laurens (  December 8, 1792) was an American merchant, slave trader, and rice planter from South Carolina who became a political leader during the Revolutionary War.  A delegate to the Second Continental Congress, Laurens succeeded John Hancock as President of the Congress.  He was a signatory to the Articles of Confederation and President of the Continental Congress when the Articles were passed on November 15, 1777. Laurens had earned great wealth as a partner in the largest slave-trading house in North America, Austin and Laurens.  In the 1750s alone, this Charleston firm oversaw the sale of more than 8,000 enslaved Africans. 

HOTOL<====>14301<====>HOTOL   HOTOL, for Horizontal Take-Off and Landing, was a 1980s British design for a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) spaceplane that was to be powered by an airbreathing jet engine.  Development was being conducted by a consortium led by Rolls-Royce and British Aerospace (BAe). Designed as a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) reusable winged launch vehicle, HOTOL was to be fitted with a unique air-breathing engine, the RB545 or Swallow, that was under development by British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce.  The propellant for the engine technically consisted of a combination of liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen; however, it was to employ a new means of dramatically reducing the amount of oxidizer needed to be carried on board by utilising atmospheric oxygen as the spacecraft climbed through the lower atmosphere. 

Hammerhead shark<====>14306<====>Hammerhead shark The hammerhead sharks are a group of sharks in the family Sphyrnidae, so named for the unusual and distinctive structure of their heads, which are flattened and laterally extended into a "hammer" shape called a cephalofoil.  Most hammerhead species are placed in the genus Sphyrna, while the winghead shark is placed in its own genus, Eusphyra.  Many, but not necessarily mutually exclusive functions have been proposed for the cephalofoil, including sensory reception, manoeuvering, and prey manipulation.  Hammerheads are found worldwide in warmer waters along coastlines and continental shelves.  Unlike most sharks, hammerheads usually swim in schools during the day, becoming solitary hunters at night. 

Hall effect<====>14307<====>Hall effect   The Hall effect is the production of a voltage difference (the Hall voltage) across an electrical conductor, transverse to an electric current in the conductor and to an applied magnetic field perpendicular to the current.  It was discovered by Edwin Hall in 1879.   For clarity, the original effect is sometimes called the ordinary Hall effect to distinguish it from other "Hall effects" which have different physical mechanisms. The Hall coefficient is defined as the ratio of the induced electric field to the product of the current density and the applied magnetic field.  It is a characteristic of  the material from which the conductor is made, since its value depends on the type, number, and properties of the charge carriers that constitute the current. 

Hoover Dam<====>14308<====>Hoover Dam    Hoover Dam is a concrete arch-gravity dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River, on the border between the U. S.  states of Nevada and Arizona.  It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression and was dedicated on September 30, 1935, by President Franklin D.  Roosevelt.  Originally known as Boulder Dam from 1933, it was officially renamed Hoover Dam by a joint resolution of Congress in 1947.  Its construction was the result of a massive effort involving thousands of workers, and cost over one hundred lives.

Adventures of Huckleberry Finn<====>14311<====>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn   Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (or, in more recent editions, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn) is a novel by Mark Twain, first published in the United Kingdom in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885.  Commonly named among the Great American Novels, the work is among the first in major American literature to be written throughout in vernacular English, characterized by local color regionalism.  It is told in the first person by Huckleberry "Huck" Finn, the narrator of two other Twain novels (Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective) and a friend of Tom Sawyer. 

Harpsichord<====>14312<====>Harpsichord A harpsichord is a musical instrument played by means of a keyboard, a row of levers which the player presses.   When the player presses one or more keys, a mechanism that plucks one or more strings with a small quill is triggered. "Harpsichord" designates the whole family of similar plucked-keyboard instruments, including the smaller virginals, muselar, and spinet.  The harpsichord was widely used in Renaissance and Baroque music.  During the late 18th century, it gradually disappeared from the musical scene, with the rise of the piano.  In the 20th century, it made a resurgence, being used in historically informed performances of older music, in new compositions, and in some styles of popular music. 

Hair<====>14313<====>Hair    Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles found in the dermis.  Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals. The human body, apart from areas of glabrous skin, is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair.  Most common interest in hair is focused on hair growth, hair types and hair care, but hair is also an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein, notably alpha-keratin. Attitudes towards different hair, such as hairstyles and hair removal, vary widely across different cultures and historical periods, but it is often used to indicate a person's personal beliefs or social position, such as their age, sex, or religion. 

Hawker Siddeley Harrier<====>14314<====>Hawker Siddeley Harrier The Hawker Siddeley Harrier, developed in the 1960s, was the first of the Harrier Jump Jet series of aircraft.  It was the first operational close-support and reconnaissance fighter aircraft with vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) capabilities and the only truly successful V/STOL design of the many that arose in that era.  The Harrier was developed directly from the Hawker Siddeley Kestrel prototype aircraft, following the cancellation of a more advanced supersonic aircraft, the Hawker Siddeley P. 1154.  The British Royal Air Force (RAF) ordered the Harrier GR. 1 and GR. 3 variants in the late 1960s. 

Hawker Harrier<====>14315<====>Hawker Harrier    The Hawker Harrier was an experimental biplane torpedo bomber aircraft built by Hawker Aircraft to a specification issued in the 1920s  for the RAF. DevelopmentIn  , the British Air Ministry laid down specifications for a high altitude bomber to replace the Hawker Horsley and for a coastal torpedo bomber (Specifications 23/25 and 24/25).  As these specifications were similar, the Air Ministry announced that a single competition would be held to study aircraft submitted for both specifications.  Mason 1994, p. 193.  Sydney Camm of Hawker Aircraft designed the Harrier to meet the requirements of Specification 23/25, with the prototype (J8325) first flying in February  , the first of the competitors for the two specifications to fly. 

Hergé<====>14317<====>Hergé Georges Prosper Remi ( ; 22 May 1907 – 3 March 1983), known by the pen name Hergé ( ), was a Belgian cartoonist.  He is best known for creating The Adventures of Tintin, the series of comic albums which are considered one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century.  He was also responsible for two other well-known series, Quick & Flupke (1930–40) and The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko (1936–57).  His works were executed in his distinct ligne claire drawing style. Born to a lower middle-class family in Etterbeek, Brussels, Hergé began his career by contributing illustrations to Scouting magazines, developing his first comic series, The Adventures of Totor, for Le Boy-Scout Belge in 1926. 

Horned God<====>14318<====>Horned God The Horned God is one of the two primary deities found in Wicca and some related forms of Neopaganism.  The term Horned God itself predates Wicca, and is an early 20th-century syncretic term for a horned or antlered anthropomorphic god with partly pseudohistorical origins, partly based on historical horned deities.  The Horned God represents the male part of the religion's duotheistic theological system, the consort of the female Triple Goddess of the Moon or other Mother Goddess.   In common Wiccan belief, he is associated with nature, wilderness, sexuality, hunting, and the life cycle. Whilst depictions of the deity vary, he is always shown with either horns or antlers upon his head, often depicted as being theriocephalic (having a beast's head), in this way emphasizing "the union of the divine and the animal", the latter of which includes humanity. 

Haggis<====>14320<====>Haggis  Haggis is a savoury pudding containing sheep's pluck (heart, liver, and lungs); minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, traditionally encased in the animal's stomach  though now often in an artificial casing instead.  According to the 2001 English edition of the Larousse Gastronomique: "Although its description is not immediately appealing, haggis has an excellent nutty texture and delicious savoury flavour".  It is believed that food similar to haggis (though not so named), perishable offal quickly cooked inside an animal's stomach, all conveniently available after a hunt, was eaten from ancient times. 

Hank Aaron<====>14321<====>Hank Aaron    Henry Louis Aaron (born February 5, 1934), nicknamed "Hammer" or "Hammerin' Hank", is a retired American Major League Baseball (MLB) right fielder who is currently the senior vice president of the Atlanta Braves.  He played 21 seasons for the Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves in the National League (NL) and two seasons for the Milwaukee Brewers in the American League (AL), from 1954 through 1976.  Aaron held the MLB record for career home runs for 33 years, and he still holds several MLB offensive records.  He hit 24 or more home runs every year from 1955 through 1973, and is one of only two players to hit 30 or more home runs in a season at least fifteen times. 

Holy Grail<====>14322<====>Holy Grail   The Holy Grail is a vessel that serves as an important motif in Arthurian literature.  Different traditions describe it as a cup, dish or stone with miraculous powers that provide happiness, eternal youth or sustenance in infinite abundance.  The term "holy grail" is often used to denote an object or goal that is sought after for its great significance.  A "grail", wondrous but not explicitly holy, first appears in Perceval, le Conte du Graal, an unfinished romance written by Chrétien de Troyes around 1190.   Here, it is a processional salver, a tray, used to serve at a feast. 

Hunt the Wumpus<====>14323<====>Hunt the Wumpus   Hunt the Wumpus is an early computer game, based on a simple hide and seek format featuring a mysterious monster (the Wumpus) that lurks deep inside a network of rooms.   It was originally developed as a text-based game written in BASIC.  Due to the source code availability the game has since been ported to various programming languages and platforms including graphical versions. Development historyHunt the Wumpus was originally written by Gregory Yob in BASIC while attending the Dartmouth campus of the University of Massachusetts in 1975.  Out of frustration with all the grid-based hunting games he had seen, such as Snark, Mugwump, and Hurkle, Yob decided to create a map-based game. 

Hearst Communications<====>14325<====>Hearst Communications   Hearst Communications Inc. , often referred to simply as Hearst, is an American mass media and business information conglomerate based in New York City, New York.  Hearst owns a wide variety of newspapers, magazines, television channels, and television stations, including the San Francisco Chronicle, the Houston Chronicle, Cosmopolitan, Esquire, 50% of broadcasting firm A&E Networks,  and 20% of the sports broadcaster ESPN—the last two both co-owned with The Walt Disney Company. Despite being better known for the above media holdings, Hearst makes most of its profits in the business information section, where it owns companies including First Databank, Homecare Homebase, MOTOR Information Systems, 80% of Fitch Ratings, and others. 

HMS Hercules<====>14326<====>HMS Hercules  Five ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS Hercules, or HMS Hercule, after the Greek and Roman hero Hercules.  Another was launched, but never served in the Navy:  was a 74-gun third rate launched in 1759 and sold in 1784. HMS Hercule was a 74-gun third rate captured by   in 1798 and broken up in 1810.   was a 74-gun third rate launched in 1815.  She was used for harbour service from 1853 and was sold in 1865.   was an ironclad battleship launched in 1868.  She was used for harbour service from 1881, as a barracks from 1905, was renamed HMS Calcutta in 1909, HMS Fisgard II in 1915, and was sold in 1932. 

HMAS Sydney<====>14327<====>HMAS SydneyFive ships of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) have been named HMAS Sydney, after Sydney, the capital city of New South Wales.  , a Town-class light cruiser launched in 1912, decommissioned in 1928, and broken up for scrap , a Leander-class light cruiser launched in 1934, and sunk following a battle with the German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran on 19 November 1941 , a Majestic-class light aircraft carrier launched in 1944, decommissioned in 1973, and broken up for scrap , an Adelaide-class guided missile frigate launched in 1980, and decommissioned in 2015 , a Hobart-class air warfare destroyer slated to enter service in 2020Battle honoursBetween them, vessels named HMAS Sydney have been awarded fourteen battle honours by the Royal Australian Navy. 

Hunter S. Thompson<====>14328<====>Hunter S.  Thompson   Hunter Stockton Thompson (July 18, 1937 – February 20, 2005) was an American journalist and author, and the founder of the gonzo journalism movement.  Born in Louisville, Kentucky, to a middle-class family, Thompson had a turbulent youth after the death of his father left the family in poverty.  He was unable to formally finish high school as he was incarcerated for 60 days after abetting a robbery.  He subsequently joined the United States Air Force before moving into journalism.  He traveled frequently, including stints in California, Puerto Rico, and Brazil, before settling in Aspen, Colorado, in the early 1960s. 

Historicism<====>14329<====>Historicism  Historicism is the idea of attributing meaningful significance to space and time, such as historical period, geographical place, and local culture.  Historicism tends to be hermeneutical because it values cautious, rigorous, and contextualized interpretation of information; or relativist, because it rejects notions of universal, fundamental and immutable interpretations.   The approach varies from individualist theories of knowledge such as empiricism and rationalism, which neglect the role of traditions. The term "historicism" (Historismus) was coined by German philosopher Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel.   Over time it has developed different and somewhat divergent meanings.  Elements of historicism appear in the writings of French essayist Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592) and Italian philosopher G. 

Hunter College<====>14330<====>Hunter College   Hunter College is one of the constituent colleges of the City University of New York, an American public university.  Hunter College 2007–2010 Undergraduate Catalog, p. 3  It is located in the Lenox Hill neighborhood of the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York City.  The college offers studies in more than one hundred undergraduate and postgraduate fields across five schools.   It also administers Hunter College High School and Hunter College Elementary School.    Hunter was founded in 1870 as a women's college; it first admitted male freshmen in 1946. 

Harry Shearer<====>14331<====>Harry Shearer  Harry Julius Shearer (born December 23, 1943) is an American actor, voice actor, comedian, writer, musician, radio host, director and producer.  He is known for his long-running roles on The Simpsons, his work on Saturday Night Live, the comedy band Spinal Tap and his radio program Le Show.  Born in Los Angeles, California, Shearer began his career as a child actor.  From 1969 to 1976, Shearer was a member of The Credibility Gap, a radio comedy group.  Following the breakup of the group, Shearer co-wrote the film Real Life with Albert Brooks and started writing for Martin Mull's television series Fernwood 2 Night. 

High fantasy<====>14336<====>High fantasy    High fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy,    defined either by its setting or by the epic stature of its characters, themes, and plot.  Brian Stableford, The A to Z of Fantasy Literature, (p.  198), Scarecrow Press, Plymouth.  2005.The term "high fantasy" was coined by Lloyd Alexander in a 1971 essay, "High Fantasy and Heroic Romance" (originally given at the New England Round Table of Children's Librarians in October 1969).  Genre overviewHigh fantasy is defined as fantasy set in an alternative, fictional ("secondary") world, rather than "the real", or "primary" world . 

Human sexual activity<====>14337<====>Human sexual activityHuman sexual activity, human sexual practice or human sexual behaviour is the manner in which humans experience and express their sexuality.  People engage in a variety of sexual acts, ranging from activities done alone (e. g. , masturbation) to acts with another person (e. g. , sexual intercourse, non-penetrative sex, oral sex, etc. ) in varying patterns of frequency, for a wide variety of reasons.  Sexual activity usually results in sexual arousal and physiological changes in the aroused person, some of which are pronounced while others are more subtle.  Sexual activity may also include conduct and activities which are intended to arouse the sexual interest of another or enhance the sex life of another, such as strategies to find or attract partners (courtship and display behaviour), or personal interactions between individuals (for instance, foreplay or BDSM). 

Hydraulic ram<====>14340<====>Hydraulic ram A hydraulic ram, or hydram, is a cyclic water pump powered by hydropower.   It takes in water at one "hydraulic head" (pressure) and flow rate, and outputs water at a higher hydraulic head and lower flow rate.  The device uses the water hammer effect to develop pressure that allows a portion of the input water that powers the pump to be lifted to a point higher than where the water originally started.  The hydraulic ram is sometimes used in remote areas, where there is both a source of low-head hydropower and a need for pumping water to a destination higher in elevation than the source. 

Homininae<====>14347<====>Homininae  Homininae is a subfamily of Hominidae.  It includes two tribes, with their extant as well as extinct species: the Hominini tribe (with the genus Homo including modern humans, Australopithecina, comprising at least three extinct (or, fossil) genera and the genus Pan including chimpanzees and bonobos), and the Gorillini tribe (gorillas).  It comprises all hominids that arose after orangutans (subfamily Ponginae) split from the line of great apes.  The Homininae cladogram has three main branches, which lead to gorillas (through the tribe Gorillini), and to humans and chimpanzees via the tribe Hominini and subtribes Hominina and Panina (see the evolutionary tree below). 

Homo habilis<====>14348<====>Homo habilis  Homo habilis was a species of the tribe Hominini, during the Gelasian and early Calabrian stages of the Pleistocene geological epoch, which lived between roughly 2. 1 and 1. 5 million years ago.  Friedemann Schrenk, Ottmar Kullmer, Timothy Bromage, "The Earliest Putative Homo Fossils", chapter 9 in: Winfried Henke, Ian Tattersall (eds. ), Handbook of Paleoanthropology, 2007, pp 1611–1631,  .  This date range overlaps with the emergence of Homo erectus.  New York Times article Fossils in Kenya Challenge Linear Evolution published August 9, 2007.  The type specimen is OH 7, discovered in 1960 at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, associated with the Oldowan lithic industry; the fossils were identified as a separate species of Homo with the proposed binomial name of H. 

Harmonica<====>14349<====>Harmonica  The harmonica, also known as a French harp or mouth organ, is a free reed wind instrument used worldwide in many musical genres, notably in blues, American folk music, classical music, jazz, country, and rock and roll.  There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions.  A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece.  Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed.  A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. 

Hops<====>14352<====>Hops Hops are the flowers (also called seed cones or strobiles) of the hop plant Humulus lupulus.   They are used primarily as a flavoring and stability agent in beer, to which they impart bitter, zesty, or citric flavours;    though they are also used for various purposes in other beverages and herbal medicine.  The hop plant is a vigorous, climbing, herbaceous perennial, usually trained to grow up strings in a field called a hopfield, hop garden (nomenclature in the South of England), or hop yard (in the West Country and U. S. ) when grown commercially. 

Huey, Dewey, and Louie<====>14356<====>Huey, Dewey, and Louie Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck are triplet cartoon characters created in 1937 by writer Ted Osborne and cartoonist Al Taliaferro, and are owned by The Walt Disney Company.  Huey, Dewey, and Louie are the nephews of Donald Duck and the grandnephews of Scrooge McDuck.  Like their uncles, the boys are anthropomorphic white ducks with yellow-orange bills and feet.  They typically wear shirts and colorful baseball caps, which are sometimes used to differentiate each character.  Huey, Dewey and Louie have made several animated appearances in both films and television, but comics remain their primary medium. 

Hammurabi<====>14358<====>HammurabiHammurabi (Akkadian:   Ḫa-am-mu-ra-bi, from the Amorite ʻAmmurāpi ("the kinsman is a healer"), itself from ʻAmmu ("paternal kinsman") and Rāpi ("healer");  ) was the sixth king of the First Babylonian Dynasty, reigning from 1792 BC to 1750 BC (according to the Middle Chronology).  He was preceded by his father, Sin-Muballit, who abdicated due to failing health.  He extended Babylon's control throughout Mesopotamia through military campaigns.   Hammurabi is known for the Code of Hammurabi, one of the earliest surviving codes of law in recorded history, which he claimed to have received from Shamash, the Babylonian god of justice. 

Huygens–Fresnel principle<====>14359<====>Huygens–Fresnel principleThe Huygens–Fresnel principle (named after Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens and French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel) is a method of analysis applied to problems of wave propagation both in the far-field limit and in near-field diffraction.  It states that every point on a wavefront is itself the source of spherical wavelets.    History In 1678, Huygens  proposed that every point to which a luminous disturbance reaches becomes a source of a spherical wave; the sum of these secondary waves determines the form of the wave at any subsequent time.  He assumed that the secondary waves travelled only in the "forward" direction and it is not explained in the theory why this is the case. 

Honey<====>14361<====>Honey    Honey is a sweet, viscous food substance produced by bees and some related insects.Bees produce honey from the sugary secretions of plants (floral nectar) or other insects (aphid honeydew) through regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation.  Honey is stored in wax structures called honeycombs.    The variety of honey produced by honey bees (the genus Apis) is the best-known, due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption.Honey is collected from wild bee colonies, or from hives of domesticated bees, a practice known as beekeeping. 

Hengist and Horsa<====>14365<====>Hengist and Horsa Hengist and Horsa are legendary brothers said to have led the Angles, Saxons and Jutes in their invasion of Britain in the 5th century.  Tradition lists Hengist as the first of the Jutish kings of Kent. According to early sources, Hengist and Horsa arrived in Britain at Ebbsfleet on the Isle of Thanet.  For a time, they served as mercenaries for Vortigern, King of the Britons, but later they turned against him (British accounts have them betraying him in the Night of the Long Knives).  Horsa was killed fighting the Britons, but Hengist successfully conquered Kent, becoming the forefather of its kings. 

Hero System<====>14368<====>Hero System The Hero System is a generic role-playing game system that was developed from the superhero RPG Champions.   After Champions fourth edition was released in 1989, a stripped-down version of its ruleset with no superhero or other genre elements was released as The Hero System Rulesbook in 1990.   As a spinoff of Champions, the Hero System is considered to have started with 4th edition (as it is mechanically identical to Champions 4th edition), rather than on its own with a 1st edition.   However, the first three editions of the game are typically referred to as Champions, rather than the Hero System, as the game for its first three editions was not sold as a universal toolkit, instead largely focusing on superheroes. 

Humphry Davy<====>14369<====>Humphry Davy   Sir Humphry Davy, 1st Baronet   (17 December 1778 29 May 1829) was a Cornish chemist and inventor,  who is best remembered today for isolating a series of substances for the first time: potassium and sodium in 1807 and calcium, strontium, barium, magnesium and boron the following year, as well as discovering the elemental nature of chlorine and iodine.  He also studied the forces involved in these separations, inventing the new field of electrochemistry.  In 1799 Davy experimented with nitrous oxide and became astonished that it made him laugh, so he nicknamed it "laughing gas", and wrote about its potential anaesthetic properties in relieving pain during surgery. 

Hecate<====>14372<====>Hecate   Hecate or Hekate ( ; Greek  ) is a goddess in Ancient Greek religion and mythology, most often shown holding a pair of torches or a key The Running Maiden from Eleusis and the Early Classical Image of Hekate by Charles M.  Edwards in the American Journal of Archaeology, Vol.  90, No.  3 (Jul. , 1986), pp.  307–318  and in later periods depicted in triple form.  She was variously associated with crossroads, entrance-ways, light, magic, witchcraft, knowledge of herbs and poisonous plants, ghosts, necromancy, and sorcery.   d'Este, Sorita & Rankine, David, Hekate Liminal Rites, Avalonia, 2009. 

Haematopoiesis<====>14374<====>HaematopoiesisHaematopoiesis (from Greek αἷμα, "blood" and ποιεῖν "to make"; also hematopoiesis in American English; sometimes also haemopoiesis or hemopoiesis) is the formation of blood cellular components.  All cellular blood components are derived from haematopoietic stem cells.In a healthy adult person, approximately 10 11 –10 12  new blood cells are produced daily in order to maintain steady state levels in the peripheral circulation.  Semester 4 medical lectures at Uppsala University 2008 by Leif Jansson  Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in the medulla of the bone (bone marrow) and have the unique ability to give rise to all of the different mature blood cell types and tissues. 

Hogmanay<====>14375<====>Hogmanay   Hogmanay ( ; ) is the Scots word for the last day of the year and is synonymous with the celebration of the New Year (Gregorian calendar) in the Scottish manner.   It is normally followed by further celebration on the morning of New Year's Day (1 January) or, in some cases, 2 January—a Scottish bank holiday. The origins of Hogmanay are unclear, but it may be derived from Norse and Gaelic observances.  Customs vary throughout Scotland, and usually include gift-giving and visiting the homes of friends and neighbours, with special attention given to the first-foot, the first guest of the new year. 

Hamster<====>14376<====>Hamster    Hamsters are rodents (order Rodentia) belonging to the subfamily Cricetinae, which contains about 25 species classified in six or seven genera.  Fox, Sue.  2006.  Hamsters.  T. F. H.  Publications Inc.   They have become established as popular small house pets,  and because they are easy to breed in captivity, hamsters are often used as laboratory animals. In the wild, hamsters are more crepuscular than nocturnal and remain underground during the day to avoid being caught by predators.  They feed primarily on seeds, fruits, and vegetation, and will occasionally eat burrowing insects. 

History of Finland<====>14378<====>History of FinlandThe history of Finland begins around 9,000 BC during the end of the last glacial period.  Stone Age cultures were Kunda, Comb Ceramic, Corded Ware, Kiukainen and Pöljä cultures.  Finnish Bronze Age started approximately 1,500 BC and the Iron Age from approximately 500 BC and lasted until 1,300 AD.  Finnish Iron Age cultures can be separated to Finnish proper, Tavastian and Karelian cultures.   Earliest written sources mentioning Finland start to appear from 12th Century forwards when Catholic Church started to gain foothold in Southwest Finland.  Due to the Northern Crusades and Swedish colonisation of some Finnish coastal areas most of the region became a part of the Kingdom of Sweden and the realm of the Catholic Church from the 13th century onwards. 

Holy Spirit<====>14379<====>Holy Spirit    Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost is a term found in English translations of the Bible that is understood differently among the Abrahamic religions.   The term is also used to describe aspects of other religions and belief structures. EtymologyThe word "Spirit" (from the Latin spiritus meaning "breath") appears as either alone or with other words, in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and the New Testament.  Combinations include expressions such as the "Holy Spirit", "Spirit of God", and in Christianity, "Spirit of Christ".  The word Spirit is rendered as רוּחַ (ruach) in Hebrew-language parts of the Old Testament. 

Helium-3<====>14380<====>Helium-3  Helium-3 (He-3, also written as  3 He, see also helion) is a light, non-radioactive isotope of helium with two protons and one neutron (common helium having two neutrons).  Its hypothetical existence was first proposed in 1934 by the Australian nuclear physicist Mark Oliphant while he was working at the University of Cambridge Cavendish Laboratory.  Oliphant had performed experiments in which fast deuterons collided with deuteron targets (incidentally, the first demonstration of nuclear fusion).    Helium-3 was thought to be a radioactive isotope until it was also found in samples of natural helium,  which is mostly helium-4, taken both from the terrestrial atmosphere and from natural gas wells. 

Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)<====>14381<====>Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)In quantum mechanics, a Hamiltonian is an operator corresponding to the total energy of the system in most of the cases.  It is usually denoted by H, also Ȟ or Ĥ.  Its spectrum is the set of possible outcomes when one measures the total energy of a system.   Because of its close relation to the time-evolution of a system, it is of fundamental importance in most formulations of quantum theory. The Hamiltonian is named after William Rowan Hamilton, who also created a revolutionary reformation of Newtonian mechanics, now called Hamiltonian mechanics, that is important in quantum physics. 

Hi-hat<====>14382<====>Hi-hat  A hi-hat, also spelled hihat or high-hat, is a combination of two cymbals, a foot-operated pedal which moves a rod which in turn moves one of the cymbals, all mounted on a metal stand.  Hihats are an essential part of the standard drum kit used by drummers in many popular music (e. g.  every genre of rock music) and traditional music  (e. g.  blues) styles.   It consists of a mating pair of small to medium-sized cymbals mounted on a stand, with the two cymbals facing each other.  The bottom cymbal is fixed and the top is mounted on a rod which moves the top cymbal towards the bottom one when a foot pedal is depressed (a hihat that is in this position is said to be "closed" or "closed hihats"). 

HAL 9000<====>14384<====>HAL 9000 HAL 9000 is a fictional character and the main antagonist in Arthur C.  Clarke's Space Odyssey series.   First appearing in 2001: A Space Odyssey, HAL (Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer) is a sentient computer (or artificial general intelligence) that controls the systems of the Discovery One spacecraft and interacts with the ship's astronaut crew.  Part of HAL's hardware is shown towards the end of the film, but he is mostly depicted as a camera lens containing a red or yellow dot, instances of which are located throughout the ship.  HAL 9000 is voiced by Douglas Rain in the two feature film adaptations of the Space Odyssey series. 

Hydrolysis<====>14385<====>Hydrolysis  Hydrolysis ( ;  ) usually means the cleavage of chemical bonds by the addition of water.  When a carbohydrate is broken into its component sugar molecules by hydrolysis (e. g.  sucrose being broken down into glucose and fructose), this is termed saccharification.  Generally, hydrolysis or saccharification is a step in the degradation of a substance OR in the language of chemistry "The reaction of cation and anion or both with water molecule due to which pH is altered, cleavage of H-O bond in hydrolysis takes place. "Hydrolysis can be the reverse of a condensation reaction in which two molecules join together into a larger one and eject a water molecule. 

Hydroxy group<====>14386<====>Hydroxy group A hydroxy or hydroxyl group is the entity with the formula OH.  It contains oxygen bonded to hydrogen.  In organic chemistry, alcohol and carboxylic acids contain hydroxy groups.   The anion [OH − ], called hydroxide, consists of a hydroxy group. According to IUPAC rules, the term hydroxyl refers to the radical OH only, while the functional group −OH is called hydroxy group.  PropertiesWater, alcohols, carboxylic acids, and many other hydroxy-containing compounds can be deprotonated readily.   This behavior is rationalized by the disparate electronegativities of oxygen and hydrogen.  Hydroxy-containing compounds engage in hydrogen bonding, which causes them to stick together, leading to higher boiling and melting points than found for compounds that lack this functional group. 

Warm-blooded<====>14387<====>Warm-blooded   Warm-blooded animal species can maintain a body temperature higher than their environment.  In particular, homeothermic species maintain a stable body temperature by regulating metabolic processes.  The only known homeotherms are birds and mammals.  Other species have various degrees of thermoregulation. Animal body temperature control varies by species, so the terms "warm-blooded" and "cold-blooded" (though still in everyday use) suggest a false idea of there being only two categories of body temperature control, and are no longer used scientifically. TerminologyIn general, warm-bloodedness refers to three separate categories of thermoregulation. Endothermy is the ability of some creatures to control their body temperatures through internal means such as muscle shivering or increasing their metabolism (Greek: ἔνδον endon "within" θέρμη thermē "heat"). 

Hephaestus<====>14388<====>Hephaestus Hephaestus ( ;  ;   Hēphaistos) is the Greek god of blacksmiths, metalworking, carpenters, craftsmen, artisans, sculptors, metallurgy, fire, and volcanoes.  Walter Burkert, Greek Religion 1985: III. 2. ii; see coverage of Lemnos-based traditions and legends at Mythic Lemnos  Hephaestus' Roman equivalent is Vulcan.  In Greek mythology, Hephaestus was the son of Zeus and Hera, the king and queen of the gods.  In another version, he was Hera's parthenogenous child, rejected by his mother because of his deformity and thrown off Mount Olympus and down to earth.  As a smithing god, Hephaestus made all the weapons of the gods in Olympus. 

Herman Charles Bosman<====>14389<====>Herman Charles Bosman  Herman Charles Bosman (5 February 1905 – 14 October 1951) is widely regarded as South Africa's greatest short-story writer.  He studied the works of Edgar Allan Poe and Mark Twain and developed a style emphasizing the use of satire.  His English-language works utilize primarily Afrikaner characters and highlight the many contradictions in Afrikaner society during the first half of the twentieth century.  The poet Roy Campbell called him "the only literary genius that South Africa has produced".  Early lifeBosman was born at Kuils River, near Cape Town, to an Afrikaner family.  He was raised with English as well as Afrikaans. 

Howitzer<====>14392<====>Howitzer  A howitzer   is a type of artillery piece characterized by a relatively short barrel and the use of comparatively small propellant charges to propel projectiles over relatively high trajectories, with a steep angle of descent. In the taxonomies of artillery pieces used by European (and European-style) armies in the 17th to 20th centuries, the howitzer stood between the "gun" (characterized by a longer barrel, larger propelling charges, smaller shells, higher velocities, and flatter trajectories) and the "mortar" (which was meant to fire at even higher angles of ascent and descent).  Howitzers, like other artillery equipment, are usually organized in groups called batteries. 

Hummer<====>14395<====>Hummer   Hummer was a brand of trucks and SUVs, first marketed in 1992 when AM General began selling a civilian version of the M998 Humvee.   In 1998, General Motors (GM) purchased the brand name from AM General and marketed three vehicles: the original Hummer H1, based on the military Humvee, as well as the new H2 and H3 models that were based on smaller, civilian-market GM platforms. By 2008, Hummer's viability in the economic downturn was being questioned, and it was placed under review by GM management.  Rather than being transferred to the Motors Liquidation Company as part of the GM bankruptcy in 2009, the brand was retained by GM, in order to investigate its sale. 

Humvee<====>14396<====>Humvee    The High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), commonly known as the Humvee, is a four-wheel drive military light truck produced by AM General.   It has largely supplanted the roles previously performed by the original jeep, and others such as the Vietnam War-era M151 jeep, the M561 "Gama Goat", their M718A1 and M792 ambulance versions, the Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle (CUCV), and other light trucks.   Primarily used by the United States military, it is also used by numerous other countries and organizations and even in civilian adaptations.  The Humvee's widespread use in the Gulf War of 1991, where it negotiated the treacherous desert terrain, helped inspire civilian Hummer versions. 

History of science<====>14400<====>History of science    The history of science is the study of the  development of science and scientific knowledge, including both the natural and social sciences.  (The history of the arts and humanities is termed history of scholarship. ) Science is a body of empirical, theoretical, and practical knowledge about the natural world, produced by scientists who emphasize the observation, explanation, and prediction of real world phenomena.  Historiography of science, in contrast, studies the methods employed by historians of science. The English word scientist is relatively recent—first coined by William Whewell in the 19th century. 

Hydrogen peroxide<====>14403<====>Hydrogen peroxide  Hydrogen peroxide is a chemical compound with the formula  .  In its pure form, it is a pale blue, clear liquid, slightly more viscous than water.  Hydrogen peroxide is the simplest peroxide (a compound with an oxygen–oxygen single bond).  It is used as an oxidizer, bleaching agent and antiseptic.  Concentrated hydrogen peroxide, or "high-test peroxide", is a reactive oxygen species and has been used as a propellant in rocketry.   Its chemistry is dominated by the nature of its unstable peroxide bond. Hydrogen peroxide is unstable and slowly decomposes in the presence of base or a catalyst. 

Hesychasm<====>14404<====>Hesychasm  Hesychasm is a mystical tradition of contemplative prayer in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  Based on Jesus's injunction in the Gospel of Matthew that "when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray",  hesychasm in tradition has been the process of retiring inward by ceasing to register the senses, in order to achieve an experiential knowledge of God (see theoria). EtymologyMeaningHesychasm,  , contemporary Byzantine  , comes from    , esychía, "stillness, rest, quiet, silence"  and    : "to keep stillness. "UsageMetropolitan Kallistos Ware, a distinguished scholar of Orthodox theology, distinguishes five distinct usages of the term "hesychasm":"solitary life", a sense, equivalent to "eremitical life", in which the term is used since the 4th century;"the practice of inner prayer, aiming at union with God on a level beyond images, concepts and language", a sense in which the term is found in Evagrius Ponticus (345-399), Maximus the Confessor (c.

Harmony Society<====>14406<====>Harmony Society  The Harmony Society was a Christian theosophy and pietist society founded in Iptingen, Germany, in 1785.  Due to religious persecution by the Lutheran Church and the government in Württemberg, the group moved to the United States, Robert Paul Sutton, Communal Utopias and the American Experience: Religious Communities (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2004) p.  38.   where representatives initially purchased land in Butler County, Pennsylvania.  On February 15, 1805, the group of approximately 400 followers formally organized the Harmony Society, placing all their goods in common. Under its founder and spiritual leader, Johann Georg Rapp (1757–1847); Frederick (Reichert) Rapp (1775–1834), his adopted son who managed its business affairs; and their associates, the Society existed for one hundred years; roughly from 1805 until 1905. 

Huneric<====>14408<====>HunericHuneric or Hunneric or Honeric (died December 23, 484) was King of the (North African) Vandal Kingdom (477–484) and the oldest son of Genseric.  He abandoned the imperial politics of his father and concentrated mainly on internal affairs.  He was married to Eudocia, daughter of western Roman Emperor Valentinian III (419–455) and Licinia Eudoxia.  The couple had one child, a son named Hilderic. Huneric was the first Vandal king who used the title King of the Vandals and Alans.  Despite adopting this style, and that the Vandals maintained their sea-power and their hold on the islands of the western Mediterranean, Huneric did not have the prestige that his father Genseric had enjoyed with other states. 

Hasdingi<====>14409<====>HasdingiThe Hasdingi were the southern tribes of the Vandals, an East Germanic tribe.   They lived in areas of today's southern Poland, western Ukraine, Slovakia and Hungary.  They were part of the migratory movements of the Vandals, into the Iberian peninsula and later on to North Africa. The Hasdingi crossed the Rhine into Gaul in 406 AD, although their king Godigisel lost his life in battle against the Franks during the crossing.  The Hasdingi settled as foederati in Gallaecia (today Galicia, Asturias and the north of Portugal) along with the Suebi in 409 AD and their territory was one of the earliest Barbarian territories to be founded. 

Hermes<====>14410<====>Hermes    Hermes ( ;  ) is an Olympian god in Greek religion and mythology, the son of Zeus and the Pleiad Maia, and the second youngest of the Olympian gods (Dionysus being the youngest). Hermes was the emissary and messenger of the gods.   Hermes was also "the divine trickster"  and "the god of boundaries and the transgression of boundaries, . . .  the patron of herdsmen, thieves, graves, and heralds.

Hedge fund<====>14412<====>Hedge fund  A hedge fund is an investment fund that pools capital from accredited individuals or institutional investors and invests in a variety of assets, often with complex portfolio-construction and risk-management techniques.    It is administered by a professional investment management firm, and often structured as a limited partnership, limited liability company, or similar vehicle.   Hedge funds are generally distinct from mutual funds, as their use of leverage is not capped by regulators, and distinct from private equity funds,  as the majority of hedge funds invest in relatively liquid assets. 

Hydrocodone<====>14413<====>Hydrocodone  Hydrocodone, also known as dihydrocodeinone, is a semi-synthetic opioid synthesized from codeine, one of the opioid alkaloids found in the opium poppy.It is a narcotic analgesic used orally for relief of moderate to severe pain, but also commonly taken in liquid form as an antitussive/cough suppressant.    Hydrocodone is prescribed predominantly within the United States, with the International Narcotics Control Board reporting that 99% of the worldwide supply in 2007 was consumed in the United States.  Several common imprints for hydrocodone are M365, M366, M367.  Medical usesHydrocodone is used to treat moderate to severe pain and as an antitussive to treat cough. 

Hashish<====>14415<====>Hashish   Hashish, or hash, is a drug made from cannabis.  While herbal cannabis is referred to as marijuana, hashish is cannabis resin.    European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, Lisbon,    It is consumed by smoking a small piece, typically in a pipe, bong, vaporizer or joint, or via oral ingestion (after decarboxylation).  As pure hashish will not burn if rolled alone in a joint, it is typically mixed with herbal cannabis, tobacco or another type of herb for this method of consumption.  Depending on region or country, multiple synonyms and alternative names exist. 

Hypnosis<====>14417<====>Hypnosis    Hypnosis is a state of human consciousness involving focused attention and reduced peripheral awareness and an enhanced capacity to respond to suggestion.  The term may also refer to an art, skill, or act of inducing hypnosis.  Theories explaining what occurs during hypnosis fall into two groups.  Altered state theories see hypnosis as an altered state of mind or trance, marked by a level of awareness different from the ordinary conscious state.    In contrast, nonstate theories see hypnosis as a form of imaginative role enactment.    During hypnosis, a person is said to have heightened focus and concentration. 

Henry Chadwick (writer)<====>14421<====>Henry Chadwick (writer)  Henry Chadwick (1824 – April 20, 1908) was an English-born American sportswriter, baseball statistician and historian, often called the "Father of Baseball" for his early reporting on and contributions to the development of the game.  He edited the first baseball guide that was sold to the public.  He is credited with creating box scores, as well as creating the abbreviation "K" that designates a strikeout.  He is said to have created the statistics of batting average and earned run average (ERA).  He was posthumously inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Early lifeChadwick was born in Exeter, England. 

Higher education<====>14423<====>Higher education  Higher education, post-secondary education, or third level education is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education.  Often delivered at universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, conservatories, and institutes of technology, higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, trade schools, and other career colleges that award academic degrees or professional certifications.  Tertiary education at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education. The right of access to higher education is mentioned in a number of international human rights instruments.

Henotheism<====>14429<====>Henotheism  Henotheism ( ) is the worship of a single god while not denying the existence or possible existence of other deities.    Friedrich Schelling (1775–1854) coined the word, and Friedrich Welcker (1784–1868) used it to depict primitive monotheism among ancient Greeks.  Max Müller (1823–1900), a German philologist and orientalist, brought the term into wider usage in his scholarship on the Indian religions,   particularly Hinduism whose scriptures mention and praise numerous deities as if they are one ultimate unitary divine essence.   Müller made the term central to his criticism of Western theological and religious exceptionalism (relative to Eastern religions), focusing on a cultural dogma which held "monotheism" to be both fundamentally well-defined and inherently superior to differing conceptions of God. 

Hedwig of Silesia<====>14431<====>Hedwig of Silesia  Saint Hedwig of Silesia ( ), also Saint Hedwig of Andechs ( ,  ; 1174 – 15 October 1243), a member of the Bavarian comital House of Andechs, was Duchess of Silesia from 1201 and of Greater Poland from 1231 as well as High Duchess consort of Poland from 1232 until 1238.

She was canonized by the Catholic Church in 1267. LifeThe daughter of Count Berthold IV of Andechs and his second wife Agnes of Wettin,  she was born at Andechs Castle in the Duchy of Bavaria. 

Hasidic Judaism<====>14436<====>Hasidic Judaism Hasidism, sometimes Hasidic Judaism ( , hasidut, Ashkenazi pronunciation: [χaˈsidus]; originally, "piety"), is a Jewish religious group.  It arose as a spiritual revival movement in contemporary Western Ukraine during the 18th century, and spread rapidly throughout Eastern Europe.  Today, most affiliates reside in the United States, Israel, and the United Kingdom.  Israel Ben Eliezer, the "Baal Shem Tov", is regarded as its founding father, and his disciples developed and disseminated it.  Present-day Hasidism is a sub-group within Ultra-Orthodox ("Haredi") Judaism, and is noted for its religious conservatism and social seclusion.  Its members adhere closely both to Orthodox Jewish practice – with the movement's own unique emphases – and the traditions of Eastern European Jews, so much so that many of the latter, including various special styles of dress and the use of the Yiddish language, are nowadays associated almost exclusively with Hasidism. 

Harmonic series (music)<====>14439<====>Harmonic series (music) A harmonic series is the sequence of sounds IEV 1994, sound:   —pure tones, represented by sinusoidal waves—in which the frequency IEV 1994, fundamental:   of each sound is an integer multiple of the fundamental, the lowest frequency.  IEV 1994, harmonic series of sounds:   Pitched musical instruments are often based on an acoustic resonator such as a string or a column of air, which oscillates at numerous modes simultaneously.  At the frequencies of each vibrating mode, waves travel in both directions along the string or air column, reinforcing and canceling each other to form standing waves. 

Hasid (term)<====>14441<====>Hasid (term)  Hasid ( , "pious"; plural "Hasidim", חסידים) is a Jewish honorific, frequently used as a term of exceptional respect in the Talmudic and early medieval periods.  In classic Rabbinic literature it differs from "Tzadik"-"righteous", by instead denoting one who goes beyond the legal requirements of ritual and ethical Jewish observance in daily life.  The literal meaning of "Hasid" derives from Chesed-"kindness", the outward expression of love for God and other people.  This spiritual devotion motivates pious conduct beyond everyday limits.  The devotional nature of its description lent itself to a few Jewish movements in history being known as "Hasidim". 

Hoosier Hysteria<====>14443<====>Hoosier HysteriaHoosier Hysteria is the state of excitement surrounding basketball in Indiana, or more specifically the Indiana high school basketball tournament.   In part, the excitement stemmed from the inclusion of all tournament entrants into the same tournament, where a small town's David might knock off a large city's Goliath.  The most famous example occurred in 1954, when Milan (enrollment 161) defeated Muncie Central (enrollment over 1,600) to win the State title.  The plot of the now famous movie, Hoosiers, was based on the story of the 1954 Milan team and seems to typify the hysteria related to basketball in the state of Indiana.

He rose to prominence through his service in the First World War, receiving numerous honours and decorations, and continued his military career through various British campaigns across Europe and Asia. 

Henry Moseley<====>14454<====>Henry Moseley   Henry Gwyn Jeffrey's Moseley (23 November 1887 – 10 August 1915) was an English physicist, whose contribution to the science of physics was the justification from physical laws of the previous empirical and chemical concept of the atomic number.  This stemmed from his development of Moseley's law in X-ray spectra.  Moseley's Law justified many concepts in chemistry by sorting the chemical elements of the periodic table of the elements in a logical order based on their physics.  He published first the Long Form periodic table or Modern periodic table  which is used till date. 

Prince Harry<====>14457<====>Prince Harry  Prince Henry of Wales    (Henry Charles Albert David; born 15 September 1984), familiarly known as Prince Harry, Harry is a traditional nickname for Henry—see also Henry (given name).  is a member of the British royal family.  He is the younger son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales, and is fifth in the line of succession to the British throne.

He then chose a military career and underwent officer training at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. 

Hail<====>14458<====>Hail   Hail is a form of solid precipitation.  It is distinct from ice pellets (American sleet), though the two are often confused.   It consists of balls or irregular lumps of ice, each of which is called a hailstone.  Ice pellets (American sleet) fall generally in cold weather while hail growth is greatly inhibited during cold surface temperatures.    Unlike other forms of water ice such as graupel, which is made of rime, and ice pellets, which are smaller and translucent, hailstones usually measure between   and   in diameter.  The METAR reporting code for hail   or greater is GR, while smaller hailstones and graupel are coded GS. 

Hypnotherapy<====>14459<====>Hypnotherapy   Hypnotherapy is type of complementary and alternative medicine in which the mind is used in an attempt to help with a variety problems, such as breaking bad habits or coping with stress.  It is used for a wide variety of applications, and studies into its efficacy are often of poor quality  which makes it difficult to determine efficacy.  Several recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews of the literature on various conditions have concluded that the efficacy of hypnotherapy is "not verified",  that there is no evidence   or insufficient evidence   for efficacy. 

Hangman (game)<====>14462<====>Hangman (game) Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players.  One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses. OverviewThe word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word.  In most variants, proper nouns, such as names, places, and brands, are not allowed.  Slang words, sometimes referred to as informal or shortened words, are also not allowed.  If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. 

Harmonic mean<====>14463<====>Harmonic meanIn mathematics, the harmonic mean (sometimes called the subcontrary mean) is one of several kinds of average, and in particular one of the Pythagorean means.  Typically, it is appropriate for situations when the average of rates is desired. The harmonic mean can be expressed as the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the given set of observations.  As a simple example, the harmonic mean of 1, 4, and 4 is  \left(\frac{1^{-1}+4^{-1}+4^{-1}}{3}\right)^{-1} = \frac{3}{\frac1{1}+\frac1{4}+\frac1{4}} = \frac{3}{1. 5} = 2\,.  DefinitionThe harmonic mean H of the positive real numbers  x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n  is defined to be H = \frac{n}{\frac1{x_1} + \frac1{x_2} + \cdots + \frac1{x_n}} = \frac{n}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac1{x_i}} = \left(\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i^{-1}}{n}\right)^{-1}. 

Hellbender<====>14465<====>Hellbender  The hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis), also known as the hellbender salamander, is a species of aquatic giant salamander endemic to eastern North America.A member of the family Cryptobranchidae, the hellbender is the only member of the genus Cryptobranchus, and is joined only by one other genus of salamanders (Andrias, which contains the Japanese and Chinese giant salamanders) at the family level.  The hellbender, which is much larger than all other salamanders in its geographic range, employs an unusual means of respiration (which involves cutaneous gas exchange through capillaries found in its dorsoventral skin folds), and fills a particular niche — both as a predator and prey — in its ecosystem, which either it or its ancestors have occupied for around 65 million years. 

Harold Eugene Edgerton<====>14466<====>Harold Eugene Edgerton  Harold Eugene "Doc" Edgerton also known as Papa Flash (April 6, 1903 – January 4, 1990) was a professor of electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   He is largely credited with transforming the stroboscope from an obscure laboratory instrument into a common device.   He also was deeply involved with the development of sonar and deep-sea photography, and his equipment was used by Jacques Cousteau in searches for shipwrecks and even the Loch Ness monster.  BiographyEarly yearsEdgerton was born in Fremont, Nebraska, on April 6, 1903, the son of Mary Nettie Coe and Frank Eugene Edgerton,   a descendant of Richard Edgerton, one of the founders of Norwich, Connecticut and a descendant of Governor William Bradford (1590–1657) of the Plymouth Colony and a passenger on the Mayflower.

IRIX<====>14537<====>IRIX IRIX is a discontinued operating system developed by Silicon Graphics (SGI) to run natively on their MIPS workstations and servers.  It is based on UNIX System V with BSD extensions.  IRIX was the first operating system to include the XFS file system. The last major version of IRIX was IRIX 6. 5, which was released in May 1998.  New minor versions of IRIX 6. 5 were released every quarter until 2005; since then there have been four further minor releases.  Through version 6. 5. 22, there were two branches of each release: a maintenance release (identified by an m suffix to the version number) that included only fixes to the original IRIX 6. 

Internet<====>14539<====>Internet  The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide.  It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies.  The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing. The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the United States Federal Government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via computer networks. 

Indo-Iranian languages<====>14541<====>Indo-Iranian languages   The Indo-Iranian languages, or Indo-Iranic languages  or Aryan languages,  constitute the largest and easternmost extant branch of the Indo-European language family.  It has more than 1 billion speakers, stretching from the Caucasus (Ossetian) and the Balkans (Romani) eastward to Xinjiang (Sarikoli) and Assam (Assamese), and south to Sri Lanka (Sinhalese) and the Maldives (Maldivian). The common ancestor of all of the languages in this family is called Proto-Indo-Iranian—also known as Common Aryan—which was spoken in approximately the late 3rd millennium BC.  The three branches of the modern Indo-Iranian languages are Indo-Aryan, Iranian, and Nuristani. 

Industry<====>14543<====>Industry   Industry is the production of goods or related services within an economy.   The major source of revenue of a group or company is the indicator of its relevant industry.    When a large group has multiple sources of revenue generation, it is considered to be working in different industries.  Manufacturing industry became a key sector of production and labour in European and North American countries during the Industrial Revolution, upsetting previous mercantile and feudal economies.  This came through many successive rapid advances in technology, such as the production of steel and coal. 

Indriidae<====>14544<====>Indriidae The Indriidae (sometimes incorrectly spelled Indridae   ) are a family of strepsirrhine primates.  They are medium- to large-sized lemurs, with only four teeth in the toothcomb instead of the usual six.  Indriids, like all lemurs, live exclusively on the island of Madagascar. CharacteristicsThe 10 extant Indriidae species vary considerably in size.  Not counting the length of their tails, the avahis are only   in length, while the indri is the largest extant strepsirrhine.  The tail of the indri is only a stub, while avahi and the sifaka tails are as long as their bodies. 

I, Robot<====>14545<====>I, Robot   I, Robot is a fixup of science fiction short stories or essay by American writer Isaac Asimov.    The stories originally appeared in the American magazines Super Science Stories and Astounding Science Fiction between 1940 and 1950 and were then compiled into a book for stand-alone publication by Gnome Press in 1950, in an initial edition of 5,000 copies.   The stories are woven together by a framing narrative in which the fictional Dr.  Susan Calvin tells each story to a reporter (who serves as the narrator) in the 21st century.   Although the stories can be read separately, they share a theme of the interaction of humans, robots, and morality, and when combined they tell a larger story of Asimov's fictional history of robotics. 

Invictus<====>14546<====>Invictus  "Invictus" is a short Victorian poem by the English poet William Ernest Henley (1849–1903).  It was written in 1875 and published in 1888 in his first volume of poems, Book of Verses, in the section Life and Death (Echoes).    TitleOriginally, the poem was published with no title.    The second edition of Henley's Book of Verses added a dedication "To R.  T.  H.  B. "—a reference to Robert Thomas Hamilton Bruce (1846–1899), a successful Scottish flour merchant, baker, and literary patron.The 1900 edition of Henley's Poems, published after Bruce's death, altered the dedication to "I. 

Tertiary sector of the economy<====>14551<====>Tertiary sector of the economy  The tertiary sector or service sector is the third of the three economic sectors of the three-sector theory.  The others are the secondary sector (approximately the same as manufacturing), and the primary sector (raw materials). The service sector consists of the production of services instead of end products.   Services (also known as "intangible goods") include attention, advice, access, experience, discussion, and   affective labor.   The production of information has long been regarded as a service, but some economists now attribute it to a fourth sector, the quaternary sector. 

Primary sector of the economy<====>14552<====>Primary sector of the economy Primary industry is a larger sector in developing countries; for instance, animal husbandry is more common in countries in Africa than in Japan.    Mining in 19th-century South Wales provides a case study of how an economy can come to rely on one form of activity.  Mining: it's only a word In developed countries primary industry has become more technologically advanced, for instance the mechanization of farming as opposed to hand picking and planting.    In more developed economies additional capital is invested in primary means of production.   As an example, in the United States corn belt, combine harvesters pick the corn, and spray systems distribute large amounts of insecticides, herbicides and fungicides, producing a higher yield than is possible using less capital-intensive techniques. 

Secondary sector of the economy<====>14553<====>Secondary sector of the economy  The secondary sector include industries that produce a finished, usable product or are involved in construction. This sector generally takes the output of the primary sector and manufactures finished goods or where they are suitable for used by other businesses, for export, or sale to domestic consumers.  This sector is often divided into light industry and heavy industry.  Many of these industries consume large quantities of energy and require factories and machinery to convert the raw materials into goods and products.  They also produce waste materials and waste heat that may cause environmental problems or cause pollution. 

Imaginary number<====>14554<====>Imaginary number    (repeats the pattern from blue area)   An imaginary number This is the definition adopted in this article.   is a complex number that can be written as a real number multiplied by the imaginary unit  , j is usually used in Engineering contexts where i has other meanings (such as electrical current)  which is defined by its property  .The square of an imaginary number   is  . 

Indictment<====>14559<====>IndictmentAn indictment (   ) is a formal accusation that a person has committed a crime.  In jurisdictions that use the concept of felonies, the most serious criminal offence is a felony; jurisdictions that do not use the concept of felonies often use that of an indictable offence—an offence that requires an indictment. Historically, in most common law jurisdictions, an indictment was handed up by a grand jury, which returned a "true bill" if it found cause to make the charge, or "no bill" if it did not find cause. Indictments by countryIndiaThe criminal law in India  is derived from the colonial-era British system and is codified in the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). 

Republic of Ireland<====>14560<====>Republic of Ireland  Ireland ( ;    ), also known as the Republic of Ireland ( ), is a sovereign state in north-western Europe occupying 26 of 32 counties of the island of Ireland.  The capital and largest city is Dublin, which is located on the eastern part of the island, and whose metropolitan area is home to around a third of the country's 4. 75 million inhabitants.  The state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom.  It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south, Saint George's Channel to the south-east, and the Irish Sea to the east. 

Irish diaspora<====>14561<====>Irish diaspora  The Irish diaspora ( ) refers to Irish people and their descendants who live outside Ireland. The phenomenon of migration from Ireland is recorded since early Medieval times, Flechner and Meeder, The Irish in Early Medieval Europe, pp.  231-41  but it is only possible to quantify it from around 1700: since then between 9 and 10 million people born in Ireland have emigrated.  This is more than the population of Ireland at its historical peak in the 1840s of 8. 5 million.  The poorest of them went to Great Britain, especially Liverpool; those who could afford it went further, including almost 5 million to the United States. 

Integer<====>14563<====>Integer   An integer (from the Latin   meaning "whole") Integer 's first literal meaning in Latin is "untouched", from in ("not") plus tangere ("to touch").  " " derives from the same origin via the French word entier, which means both entire and integer (see:  )  is a number that can be written without a fractional component.  For example, 21, 4, 0, and −2048 are integers, while 9. 75,  , and   are not. The set of integers consists of zero ( ), the positive natural numbers ( ,  ,  , …), also called whole numbers or counting numbers,  and their additive inverses (the negative integers, i. 

Impressionism in music<====>14566<====>Impressionism in music  Impressionism in music was a movement among various composers in Western classical music (mainly during the late 19th and early 20th centuries) whose music focuses on suggestion and atmosphere, "conveying the moods and emotions aroused by the subject rather than a detailed tone‐picture".   "Impressionism" is a philosophical and aesthetic term borrowed from late 19th century French painting after Monet's Impression, Sunrise.  Composers were labeled impressionists by analogy to the impressionist painters who use starkly contrasting colors, effect of light on an object, blurry foreground and background, flattening perspective, etc.  to make the observer focus his attention on the overall impression. 

International trade<====>14567<====>International trade   International Trade is the exchange of capital, goods, and services across international borders or territories.   In most countries, such trade represents a significant share of gross domestic product (GDP).  While international trade has existed throughout history (for example Uttarapatha, Silk Road, Amber Road, scramble for Africa, Atlantic slave trade, salt roads), its economic, social, and political importance has been on the rise in recent centuries. Characteristic of global tradeTrading globally gives consumers and countries the opportunity to be exposed to new markets and products.  Almost every kind of product can be found in the international market: food, clothes, spare parts, oil, jewelry, wine, stocks, currencies, and water. 

Interpolation<====>14569<====>Interpolation  In the mathematical field of numerical analysis, interpolation is a method of constructing new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points. In engineering and science, one often has a number of data points, obtained by sampling or experimentation, which represent the values of a function for a limited number of values of the independent variable.  It is often required to interpolate (i. e. , estimate) the value of that function for an intermediate value of the independent variable.  A different problem which is closely related to interpolation is the approximation of a complicated function by a simple function. 

Intension<====>14570<====>Intension   In linguistics, logic, philosophy, and other fields, an intension is any property or quality connoted by a word, phrase, or another symbol.   In the case of a word, the word's definition often implies an intension.  For instance, intension of the word 'plant' includes properties like "being composed of cellulose" and "alive" and "organism", among others.  Comprehension is the collection of all such intensions. The meaning of a word can be thought of as the bond between the idea the word means and the physical form of the word.  Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913) contrasts three concepts:the signifier – the "sound image" or the string of letters on a page that one recognizes as the form of a signthe signified – the meaning, the concept or idea that a sign expresses or evokesthe referent – the actual thing or set of things a sign refers to.

Intel<====>14617<====>Intel Intel Corporation (also known as Intel, stylized as intel) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, in the Silicon Valley.  It is the world's second largest and second highest valued semiconductor chip makers based on revenue after being overtaken by Samsung,   and is the inventor of the x86 series of microprocessors, the processors found in most personal computers (PCs).  Intel supplies processors for computer system manufacturers such as Apple, Lenovo, HP, and Dell.  Intel also manufactures motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing. 

İsmet İnönü<====>14618<====>İsmet İnönü  Mustafa İsmet İnönü ( ; 24 September 1884 – 25 December 1973) was a Turkish general  and statesman, who served as the second President of Turkey from 11 November 1938, the day after the death of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, to 22 May 1950, when his Republican People's Party was defeated in Turkey's second free elections.  He also served as the first Chief of the General Staff from 1922 to 1924, and as the first Prime Minister after the declaration of the Republic, serving three terms: from 1923 to 1924, 1925 to 1937, and 1961 to 1965. 

Inorganic chemistry<====>14624<====>Inorganic chemistry Inorganic chemistry deals with the synthesis and behavior of inorganic and organometallic compounds.  This field covers all chemical compounds except the myriad organic compounds (carbon based compounds, usually containing C-H bonds), which are the subjects of organic chemistry.  The distinction between the two disciplines is far from absolute, as there is much overlap in the subdiscipline of organometallic chemistry.  It has applications in every aspect of the chemical industry, including catalysis, materials science, pigments, surfactants, coatings, medications, fuels, and agriculture.    Key conceptsMany inorganic compounds are ionic compounds, consisting of cations and anions joined by ionic bonding. 

Insert (filmmaking)<====>14625<====>Insert (filmmaking) In film, an insert is a shot of part of a scene as filmed from a different angle and/or focal length from the master shot.  Inserts cover action already covered in the master shot, but emphasize a different aspect of that action due to the different framing.  An insert differs from a cutaway as cutaways cover action not covered in the master shot.    There are more exact terms to use when the new, inserted shot is another view of actors: close-up, head shot, knee shot, two shot.  So the term "insert" is often confined to views of objects—and body parts, other than the head. 

Ingmar Bergman<====>14626<====>Ingmar Bergman   Ernst Ingmar Bergman ( ; 14 July 1918 – 30 July 2007) was a Swedish director, writer, and producer who worked in film, television, theatre and radio.  He is recognized as one of the most accomplished and influential filmmakers of all time,and is most famous for films such as The Seventh Seal (1957), Wild Strawberries (1957), Persona (1966), Cries and Whispers (1972), and Fanny and Alexander (1982). Bergman directed over sixty films and documentaries for cinematic release and for television, most of which he also wrote.  He also directed over 170 plays. 

Isaac Newton<====>14627<====>Isaac Newton   Sir Isaac Newton   ( ;  25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27  ) was an English mathematician, astronomer, theologian, author and physicist (described in his own day as a "natural philosopher") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the scientific revolution.   His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ("Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"), first published in 1687, laid the foundations of classical mechanics.   Newton also made pathbreaking contributions to optics, and he shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus. 

Inventor<====>14629<====>Inventor An inventor is a person who creates or discovers a new method, form, device or other useful means that becomes known as an invention. The word inventor comes from the Latin verb invenire, invent-, to find.   The system of patents was established to encourage inventors by granting limited-term, limited monopoly on inventions determined to be sufficiently novel, non-obvious, and useful. Although inventing is closely associated with science and engineering, inventors are not necessarily engineers nor scientists. See also  References  

Immanuel Kant<====>14631<====>Immanuel KantImmanuel Kant ( ;   ; 22 April 1724 – 12 February 1804) was a German philosopher who is a central figure in modern philosophy.   Kant argued that the human mind creates the structure of human experience, that reason is the source of morality, that aesthetics arises from a faculty of disinterested judgment, that space and time are forms of human sensibility, and that the world as it is "in-itself" is independent of man's concepts of it.  Kant took himself to have effected a "Copernican revolution" in philosophy, akin to Copernicus' reversal of the age-old belief that the sun revolved around the earth. 

History of Indonesia<====>14643<====>History of Indonesia    The history of Indonesia has been shaped by its geographic position, its natural resources, a series of human migrations and contacts, wars and conquests, as well as by trade, economics and politics.  Indonesia is an archipelagic country of 17,000 to 18,000 islands (8,844 named and 922 permanently inhabited) stretching along the equator in South East Asia.  The country's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade; trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history.  The area of Indonesia is populated by peoples of various migrations, creating a diversity of cultures, ethnicities, and languages. 

Geography of Indonesia<====>14644<====>Geography of Indonesia  Indonesia is an archipelagic island country in South east Asia, lying between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.  It is in a strategic location astride or along major sea lanes from Indian Ocean to Pacific Ocean.  Indonesia's different cultures have been shaped—although not specifically determined—by centuries of complex interactions with the physical environment. Overview Indonesia is an archipelago country extending   from east to west and   from north to south.   According to a geospatial survey conducted between 2007 and 2010 by National Coordinating Agency for Survey and Mapping (Bakosurtanal), Indonesia has 13,466 islands. 

Demographics of Indonesia<====>14645<====>Demographics of Indonesia  The population of Indonesia according to the 2010 national census was 237. 64 million,    and it was estimated to reach 255. 4 million in 2015.58% live on the island of Java,  the world's most populous island.  Despite a fairly effective family planning program that has been in place since 1967,  for the decade ending in 2010, Indonesia's population growth was 1. 49 percent.  At that rate, Indonesia's population is projected to surpass the present population of the United States and would - if the current US population did not rise - become the world's third biggest country after China and India by 2043. 

Politics of Indonesia<====>14646<====>Politics of Indonesia    The Politics of Indonesia take place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Indonesia is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system.  Executive power is exercised by the government.  Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two People's Representative Councils.  The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.  The 1945 constitution provided for a limited separation of executive, legislative and judicial power.  The governmental system has been described as "presidential with parliamentary characteristics. 

Economy of Indonesia<====>14647<====>Economy of Indonesia    Indonesia has the largest economy in Southeast Asia and is one of the emerging market economies of the world.  The country is also a member of G-20 major economies and classified as a newly industrialised country.   It is the sixteenth largest economy in the world by nominal GDP and is the seventh largest in terms of GDP (PPP).  Its GDP per capita however ranks below the world average.  Indonesia still depends on domestic market, and government budget spending and its ownership of state-owned enterprises (the central government owns 141 enterprises) and the administration of prices of a range of basic goods including, rice, and electricity plays a significant role in Indonesia market economy, but since the 1990s, the majority of the economy has been controlled by private Indonesians and foreign companies. 

Communications in Indonesia<====>14648<====>Communications in Indonesia   Communications in Indonesia has a complex history due to the need to reach an extended archipelago of over 17,500 islands.  The once important non-electronic communication methods of the past have given away to a considerable telecommunications infrastructure in contemporary Indonesia. HistoryIndonesia has long been using traditional forms of slayed communications  between various islands and villages.  It was not until the sixteenth century when the Dutch colonised Indonesia, constructing a more elaborate communication system, both within Indonesia and to other countries.  The first connection to Australia was an undersea telegraph cable that was completed on 18 November 1871, connecting Java to Darwin, and eventually to the Australian Overland Telegraph Line across Australia. 

Transport in Indonesia<====>14649<====>Transport in Indonesia  Indonesia's transport system has been shaped over time by the economic resource base of an archipelago with thousands of islands, and the distribution of its more than 200 million people highly concentrated on a single island, Java.  All transport modes play a role in the country’s transport system and are generally complementary rather than competitive. Road transport is predominant, with a total system length of est 438,000 km in 2008. The railway system has four unconnected networks in Java and Sumatra primarily dedicated to transport bulk commodities and long-distance passenger traffic. Sea transport is extremely important for economic integration and for domestic and foreign trade. 

Indonesian National Armed Forces<====>14650<====>Indonesian National Armed Forces The Indonesian National Armed Forces ( , TNI); in 2016 comprises approximately 395,500    military personnel including the Army (TNI-AD), Navy (TNI-AL) including the Indonesian Marine Corps (Korps Marinir), and the Air Force (TNI-AU). The Indonesian Armed Forces was formed during the Indonesian National Revolution, when it undertook a guerrilla war along with informal militia.  As a result of this, and the need to maintain internal security, the Armed forces including the Army, Navy, and Air Force has been organised along territorial lines, aimed at defeating internal enemies of the state and potential external invaders. 

Foreign relations of Indonesia<====>14651<====>Foreign relations of Indonesia   Since independence, Indonesia  foreign relations have adhered to a "free and active" foreign policy, seeking to play a role in regional affairs commensurate with its size and location but avoiding involvement in conflicts among major powers.  Indonesian foreign policy under the "New Order" government of President Suharto moved away from the stridently anti-Western, anti-American posturing that characterised the latter part of the Sukarno era.  Following Suharto's ouster in 1998, Indonesia's government has preserved the broad outlines of Suharto's independent, moderate foreign policy.  Preoccupation with domestic problems has not prevented successive presidents from travelling abroad and Indonesia's participation in many international fora. 

List of islands of Indonesia<====>14652<====>List of islands of Indonesia   The islands of Indonesia, also known as the Indonesian archipelago and formerly known as the Indian archipelago, may refer either to the islands comprising the nation-state of Indonesia or to the geographical groups which include its islands.  According to the Indonesian Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs, of 17,504 officially listed islands within the territory of the Republic of Indonesia, 16,056 island names have been verified by the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names (UNGEGN) as of July 2017.  HistoryThe exact number of islands comprising Indonesia varies among definitions and sources.

It is centered on Lower Mesopotamia (corresponding to historical Babylonia, later also known as ʿIrāq-i ʿArab) but also includes part of Upper Mesopotamia  and of the Syrian Desert and the Arabian Desert.  Its history includes much of the world's earliest writing, literature, sciences, mathematics, laws and philosophies; hence its common epithet, the Cradle of Civilization. As part of the larger Fertile Crescent, Mesopotamia saw the earliest emergence of civilization in the Neolithic (the Ubaid period) Age and formed a significant part of the Ancient Near East throughout the Bronze Age and the Iron Age (Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian and Assyrian). 

Geography of Iraq<====>14665<====>Geography of Iraq The geography of Iraq is diverse and falls into four main regions: the desert (west of the Euphrates), Upper Mesopotamia (between the upper Tigris and Euphrates rivers), the northern highlands of Iraqi Kurdistan, and Lower Mesopotamia, the alluvial plain extending from around Tikrit to the Persian Gulf.

Economy of Iraq<====>14668<====>Economy of Iraq  Iraq's economy is dominated by the oilsector, which has provided about 95% of foreign exchange earnings in modern times.   In the 1980s, financial problems caused by massive expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil export facilities by Iran led the government to implement austerity measures, borrow heavily, and later reschedule foreign debt payments; Iraq suffered economic losses of at least $80 billion from the war.   After the end of hostilities, in 1988, oil exports gradually increased with the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged facilities.  Since mid-2009, oil export earnings have returned to levels seen before Operation New Dawn and government revenues have rebounded, along with global oil prices.

Railways total:2,272 km standard gauge:2,272 km  For more than two decades there have been plans for building a metro system in Baghdad.  It is possible that part of the tunnels have been built, but that they are now used for military, hiding cats, and escaping purposes.  U. N.  inspectors have heard of the tunnels for years, but have not found their entrances.  [1] map [2] [3]  In November, 2008, an overground service dubbed the Baghdad Metro began service. 

Foreign relations of Iraq<====>14672<====>Foreign relations of Iraq  Since 1980, the foreign relations of Iraq were influenced by a number of controversial decisions by the Saddam Hussein administration.  Hussein had good relations with the Soviet Union and a number of western countries such as France and Germany, who provided him with advanced weapons systems.  He also developed a tenuous relation with the United States, who supported him during the Iran–Iraq war.  However, the Invasion of Kuwait that triggered the Gulf War brutally changed Iraq's relations with the Arab World and the West.  Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria and others were among the countries that supported Kuwait in the UN coalition. 

Demographics of the Republic of Ireland<====>14676<====>Demographics of the Republic of Ireland The Republic of Ireland had a population of 4,757,976 at the 2016 census.  Demographic historyThe island of Ireland, throughout most of its history, had a small population, comparable to that of other regions of similar area in Europe.  In the 18th and early 19th centuries, Ireland experienced a major population boom as a result of the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions.  In the 50-year period 1790-1840, the population of the island doubled from 4 million to 8 million.  At its peak, Ireland's population density was similar to that of England and continental Europe. 

Politics of the Republic of Ireland<====>14677<====>Politics of the Republic of Ireland    Ireland is a parliamentary, representative democratic republic and a member state of the European Union.

Italy has 60,656,000 inhabitants according to the calculations current as of January 1, 2017 [1] Its population density, at  , is higher than that of most Western European countries.  However the distribution of the population is widely uneven.  The most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (that accounts for almost half of the national population) and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples, while vast regions such as the Alps and Apennines highlands, the plateaus of Basilicata and the island of Sardinia are very sparsely populated. 

Politics of Italy<====>14701<====>Politics of Italy  Politics of Italy is conducted through a Parliamentary Republic with a multi-party system.  Italy has been a democratic republic since 2 June 1946, when the monarchy was abolished by popular referendum and a constituent assembly was elected to draft a constitution, which was promulgated on 1 January 1948. The executive power is exercised collectively by the Council of Ministers, which is led by the Prime Minister, officially referred to as President of the Council ("Presidente del Consiglio").  Legislative power is vested in the two houses of parliament primarily, and secondarily on the Council of Ministers, which can introduce bills and holds the majority in the parliament.

Transport in Italy<====>14704<====>Transport in Italy Italy has a well developed transport infrastructure.  The Italian rail network is extensive, especially in the north, and it includes a high-speed rail network that joins the major cities of Italy from Naples through northern cities such as Milan and Turin.  Italy has 2,507 people and 12. 46 km 2  per kilometer of rail track, giving Italy the world's 13th largest rail network.  Italy's road network is also widespread, with a total length of about 487,700 km.   It comprises both an extensive motorway network (6,400 km), mostly toll roads, and national and local roads. 

Italian Armed Forces<====>14705<====>Italian Armed Forces  The Italian Armed Forces (italian: Forze armate italiane) encompass the Italian Army, the Italian Navy and the Italian Air Force.  A fourth branch of the armed forces, known as the Carabinieri, take on the role as the nation's military police and are also involved in missions and operations abroad as a combat force.  Despite not being a branch of the armed forces, the Guardia di Finanza is part of the military and operates a large fleet of ships, aircraft and helicopters, enabling it to patrol Italy's waters and to eventually participate in warfare scenarios. 

Foreign relations of Italy<====>14706<====>Foreign relations of Italy Foreign relations of the Italian Republic are the Italian government's external relations with the outside world.  Located in Europe, Italy has been considered a major Western power  since its unification in 1861.   Its main allies are the NATO countries and the EU states, two entities of which Italy is a founding member. Italy has a particular role within the Christian world because Rome is the seat of the Pope and the center of the Catholic Church.  Italy acts as a mediator in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and has many troops deployed in the Middle East, and all over the world for peacekeeping missions, and for combating organized crime, illegal drug trade, human trafficking, piracy and terrorism. 

Italian language<====>14708<====>Italian languageItalian (    or lingua italiana  ) is a Romance language.  By most measures, Italian, together with Sardinian, is the closest to Latin of the Romance languages.  Italian is an official language in Italy, Switzerland, San Marino, Vatican City and western Istria (in Slovenia and Croatia).  It used to have official status in Albania, Malta and Monaco, where it is still widely spoken, as well as in former Italian East Africa and Italian North Africa regions where it plays a significant role in various sectors.  Italian is also spoken by large expatriate communities in the Americas and Australia.

He began his career as an underground rapper in the 1980s and was signed to Sire Records in 1987, when he released his debut album Rhyme Pays; the first hip-hop album to carry an explicit content sticker.  The following year, he founded the record label Rhyme $yndicate Records (named after his collective of fellow hip-hop artists called the "Rhyme $yndicate") and released another album, Power. He co-founded the heavy metal band Body Count, which he introduced on his 1991 rap album O. 

Iron Age<====>14711<====>Iron Age  The Iron Age is the final epoch of  the three-age system, preceded by the Stone Age (Neolithic) and the Bronze Age.  It is an archaeological era in the prehistory and protohistory of Europe and the Ancient Near East, and by analogy also used of other parts of the Old World. The three-age system was introduced in the first half of the 19th century for the archaeology of Europe in particular, and by the later 19th century expanded to the archaeology of the Ancient Near East.  Its name harks back to the mythological "Ages of Man" of Hesiod. 

EFnet<====>14712<====>EFnet EFnet or Eris-Free network is a major Internet Relay Chat (IRC) network, with more than 35,000 users.   It is the modern-day descendant of the original IRC network. HistoryInitially, most IRC servers formed a single IRC network, to which new servers could join without restriction, but this was soon abused by people who set up servers to sabotage other users, channels, or servers.  Restriction grew and, in August 1990,  eris. berkeley. edu  was the last server indiscriminately allowing other servers to join it.  A group of operators, with the support of Jarkko Oikarinen, introduced a new "Q-line" into their server configurations, to "quarantine" themselves away from eris by disconnecting from any subset of the IRC network as soon as they saw eris there.

DALnet<====>14715<====>DALnet   DALnet is an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) network made up of 33 servers, with a stable population of approximately 8,000 users in about 7,000 channels.  DALnet is accessible by connecting with an IRC client to an active DALnet server on ports 6660 through 6669, and 7000.  SSL users can connect on port 6697  as well.  The generic round-robin address is  irc. dal. net . HistoryDALnet was founded in July 1994 by members of the EFnet  channel.  This new network was known as "dal's net", after the nickname used by the administrator of the first IRC server on the network, "dalvenjah", taken from the dragon "Dalvenjah Foxfire", in a fantasy novel by Thorarinn Gunnarsson. 

BitchX<====>14716<====>BitchX BitchX   is a free IRC client   ("If you're already using Linux, then you have your choice of several (IRC) clients.  BitchX is a popular one. ")  and has been considered to be the most popular ircII-based IRC client.The initial implementation, written by "Trench" and "HappyCrappy", was a script for the IrcII chat client.   It was converted to a program in its own right by panasync (Colten Edwards).  BitchX 1. 1 final was released in 2004.  It is written in C and is a TUI application utilizing ncurses.

XChat Subversion repository history, showing few commits other than to plug-in code since 2010  Some Linux distributions, such as Fedora, maintain their own versions to fix bugs, keep the program working and able to build, and to resolve security issues. 

IRC takeover<====>14720<====>IRC takeover  An IRC channel takeover is an acquisition of IRC channel operator status by someone other than the channel's owner.  It has largely been eliminated due to the increased use of services on IRC networks. Riding the splitThe most common variety of channel takeover uses disconnections caused by a netsplit; this is called riding the split.  After such mass disconnections, a channel may be left without users, allowing the first rejoining user to recreate the channel and gain operator status.  When the servers merge, any pre-existing operators retain their status, allowing the new user to kick out the original operators and take over the channel. 

Irssi<====>14722<====>Irssi Irssi (  (audio)) is an IRC client program for Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Microsoft Windows.  It was originally written by Timo Sirainen, and released under the terms of the GNU General Public License in January 1999.  FeaturesIrssi is written in the C programming language and in normal operation uses a text-mode user interface.    According to the developers, Irssi was written from scratch, not based on ircII (like BitchX and epic).   This freed the developers from having to deal with the constraints of an existing codebase, allowing them to maintain tighter control over issues such as security and customization.

Intellectual property<====>14724<====>Intellectual property   Intellectual property (or "IP") is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect, and primarily encompasses copyrights, patents, and trademarks.  It also includes other types of rights, such as trade secrets, publicity rights, moral rights, and rights against unfair competition.  Artistic works like music and literature, as well as some discoveries, inventions, words, phrases, symbols, and designs can all be protected as intellectual property.    Intellectual property law has evolved over centuries.   It was not until the 19th century that the term "intellectual property" began to be used, and not until the late 20th century that it became commonplace in the majority of the world. 

Great Famine (Ireland)<====>14726<====>Great Famine (Ireland)The Great Famine ( ,  ) or the Great Hunger was a period of mass starvation, disease, and emigration in Ireland between 1845 and 1849.   It is sometimes referred to, mostly outside Ireland, as the Irish Potato Famine, because about two-fifths of the population was solely reliant on this cheap crop for a number of historical reasons.    During the famine, about one million people died and a million more emigrated from Ireland,  causing the island's population to fall by between 20% and 25%.  The proximate cause of famine was potato blight,  which ravaged potato crops throughout Europe during the 1840s. 

Isle of Man<====>14727<====>Isle of Man    The Isle of Man (   ), also known simply as Mann ( ;    ), is a self-governing British Crown dependency in the Irish Sea between the islands of Great Britain and Ireland.  The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann and is represented by a Lieutenant Governor.  Defence is the responsibility of the Lord of Mann, who provides defence through the HM Armed Forces of the British Government. Ranked by the World Bank as the 5th richest nation in the world by GDP per capita,  the largest sectors are insurance and  eGaming with 17% of GNP each, followed by ICT and banking with 9% each. 

Italic languages<====>14729<====>Italic languages  The Italic languages are a subfamily of the Indo-European language family, originally spoken by Italic peoples.  They include Latin and its descendants (the Romance languages) as well as a number of extinct languages of the Italian Peninsula, including Umbrian, Oscan, Faliscan and South Picene. With over 800 million native speakers, the Italic languages are the second most widely spoken branch of the Indo-European family, after the Indo-Iranian languages. In the past, various definitions of "Italic" have prevailed.  This article uses the classification presented by the Linguist List:  Italic includes the Latin subgroup (Latin and the Romance languages) as well as the ancient Italic languages (Faliscan, Osco-Umbrian and two unclassified Italic languages, Aequian and Vestinian). 

Internet Relay Chat<====>14730<====>Internet Relay Chat  Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is an application layer protocol that facilitates communication in the form of text.  The chat process works on a client/server networking model.  IRC clients are computer programs that a user can install on their system.  These clients communicate with chat servers to transfer messages to other clients.IRC is mainly designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels,  but also allows one-on-one communication via private messages  as well as chat and data transfer,  including file sharing.  Client software is available for every major operating system that supports Internet access. 

Ideogram<====>14731<====>Ideogram  An ideogram or ideograph (from Greek   idéa "idea" and   gráphō "to write") is a graphic symbol that represents an idea or concept, independent of any particular language, and specific words or phrases.   Some ideograms are comprehensible only by familiarity with prior convention; others convey their meaning through pictorial resemblance to a physical object, and thus may also be referred to as pictograms. Terminology In proto-writing, used for inventories and the like, physical objects are represented by stylized or conventionalized pictures, or pictograms.  For example, the pictorial Dongba symbols without Geba annotation cannot represent the Naxi language, but are used as a mnemonic for reciting oral literature. 

Irish Republican Army (1919–1922)<====>14732<====>Irish Republican Army (1919–1922)    The Irish Republican Army (IRA) (  ) was an Irish republican revolutionary paramilitary organisation.  The ancestor to many groups also known as the Irish Republican Army, it was descended from the Irish Volunteers, an organisation established on 25 November 1913 that staged the Easter Rising in April 1916.   In 1919, the Irish Republic that had been proclaimed during the Easter Rising was formally established by an elected assembly (Dáil Éireann), and the Irish Volunteers were recognised by Dáil Éireann as its legitimate army.  Thereafter, the IRA waged a guerrilla campaign against the British occupation of Ireland in the 1919–21 Irish War of Independence. 

Iron<====>14734<====>Iron    Iron is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from  ) and atomic number 26.  It is a metal in the first transition series.  It is by mass the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core.  It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust.  Its abundance in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production by fusion in high-mass stars, where it is the last element to be produced with release of energy before the violent collapse of a supernova, which scatters the iron into space. 

IEEE 802.15<====>14735<====>IEEE 802. 15IEEE 802. 15 is a working group of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) IEEE 802 standards committee which specifies wireless personal area network (WPAN) standards.  There are 10 major areas of development, not all of which are active.   The number of Task Groups in IEEE 802. 15 varies based on the number of active projects.   The current list of active projects can be found on the IEEE 802. 15 web site. IEEE 802. 15. 1: WPAN / BluetoothTask group one is based on Bluetooth technology.  It defines physical layer (PHY) and Media Access Control (MAC) specification for wireless connectivity with fixed, portable and moving devices within or entering personal operating space. 

IEEE 802<====>14736<====>IEEE 802 IEEE 802 is a family of IEEE standards dealing with local area networks and metropolitan area networks. More specifically, the IEEE 802 standards are restricted to networks carrying variable-size packets.  By  contrast, in cell relay networks data is transmitted in short, uniformly sized units called cells.  Isochronous networks, where data is transmitted as a steady stream of octets, or groups of  octets, at regular time intervals, are also out of the scope of this standard.  The number 802 was simply the next free number IEEE could assign,  though “802” is sometimes associated with the date the first meeting was held — February 1980. 

IEEE 802.11<====>14739<====>IEEE 802. 11IEEE 802. 11 is a set of media access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) specifications for implementing wireless local area network (WLAN) computer communication in the 900 MHz and 2. 4, 3. 6, 5, and 60 GHz frequency bands.  They are created and maintained by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEEE 802).  The base version of the standard was released in 1997, and has had subsequent amendments.  The standard and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the Wi-Fi brand.  While each amendment is officially revoked when it is incorporated in the latest version of the standard, the corporate world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote capabilities of their products. 

Irn-Bru<====>14741<====>Irn-Bru   Irn-Bru (  "iron brew") is a Scottish carbonated soft drink, often described as "Scotland's other national drink" (after whisky).   It is produced in Westfield, Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, by A. G.  Barr of Glasgow, since moving out of their Parkhead factory in the mid-2000s, and at a second manufacturing site in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, England.  In addition to being sold throughout the United Kingdom, Barr's Irn-Bru is available throughout the world and can usually be purchased where there is a significant community of people from Scotland.  Innovative and sometimes controversial marketing campaigns have kept it as the number one selling soft drink in Scotland, where it competes directly with global brands such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi. 

Internet Standard<====>14742<====>Internet Standard In computer network engineering, an Internet Standard is a normative specification of a technology or methodology applicable to the Internet.  Internet Standards are created and published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Engineering contributions to the IETF start as an Internet Draft, may be promoted to a Request for Comments, and may eventually become an Internet Standard. An Internet Standard is characterized by technical maturity and usefulness.  The IETF also defines a Proposed Standard as a less mature but stable and well-reviewed specification.  A Draft Standard is a third, even less mature classification that was discontinued in 2011. 

ITU-T<====>14744<====>ITU-TThe ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) is one of the three sectors (divisions or units) of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU); it coordinates standards for telecommunications. The standardization efforts of ITU commenced in 1865 with the formation of the International Telegraph Union (ITU).  ITU became a specialized agency of the United Nations in 1947.  The International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT, from  ) was created in 1956, and was renamed ITU-T in 1993.    ITU-T has a permanent secretariat, the Telecommunication Standardization Bureau (TSB), based at the ITU headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.  The current Director of the Bureau is Chaesub Lee, whose 4-year term commenced on 1 January 2015,  who replaced Malcolm Johnson of the United Kingdom, who was director from 1 January 2007 to 2014.

Internalization<====>14746<====>InternalizationInternalization (or internalisation) has different definitions depending on the field that the term is used in.  Internalization is the opposite of externalization.  Generally, internalization describes the psychological outcome of a conscious mind reasoning about a specific subject; the subject is internalized, and the consideration of the subject is internal. Internalization of ideals might take place following religious conversion, or in the process of, more generally, moral conversion.Internalization is directly associated with learning within an organism (or business) and recalling what has been learned. Psychology and sociology In sciences such as psychology and sociology, internalization involves the integration of attitudes, values, standards and the opinions of others into one's own identity or sense of self. 

Indium<====>14749<====>Indium   Indium is a chemical element with symbol In and atomic number 49.  It is a post-transition metal that makes up 0. 21 parts per million of the Earth's crust.  Very soft and malleable, indium has a melting point higher than sodium and gallium, but lower than lithium and tin.  Chemically, indium is similar to gallium and thallium, and it is largely intermediate between the two in terms of its properties.Indium was discovered in 1863 by Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter by spectroscopic methods.  They named it for the indigo blue line in its spectrum. 

Iodine<====>14750<====>Iodine    Iodine is a chemical element with symbol I and atomic number 53.  The heaviest of the stable halogens, it exists as a lustrous, purple-black metallic solid at standard conditions that sublimes readily to form a violet gas.   The elemental form was discovered by the French chemist Bernard Courtois in 1811.  It was named two years later by Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac from this property, after the Greek ἰωδης "violet-coloured". Iodine occurs in many oxidation states, including iodide (I − ), iodate ( ), and the various periodate anions.  It is the least abundant of the stable halogens, being the sixty-first most abundant element. 

IKEA<====>14751<====>IKEA    IKEA (  or  ;   ) is a Swedish-founded multinational group, headquartered in the Netherlands, that designs and sells  , kitchen appliances and home accessories.  It has been the world's largest furniture retailer since at least 2008.  It was founded in Sweden in 1943 by then-17-year-old Ingvar Kamprad, who was listed by Forbes in 2015 as one of the ten richest people in the world, worth more than 40 billion dollars.The company's name is an acronym that consists of the initials of Ingvar Kamprad (name of founder), Elmtaryd (the farm where he grew up), and Agunnaryd (his hometown in Småland, southern Sweden). 

Iridium<====>14752<====>Iridium    Iridium is a chemical element with symbol Ir and atomic number 77.  A very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group, iridium is the second densest element (after osmium).  It is also the most corrosion-resistant metal, even at temperatures as high as 2000 °C.  Although only certain molten salts and halogens are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable. Iridium was discovered in 1803 among insoluble impurities in natural platinum.  Smithson Tennant, the primary discoverer, named iridium for the Greek goddess Iris, personification of the rainbow, because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts. 

International Phonetic Alphabet<====>14761<====>International Phonetic AlphabetThe International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is an alphabetic system of phonetic notation based primarily on the Latin alphabet.  It was devised by the International Phonetic Association in the late 19th century as a standardized representation of the sounds of spoken language.  International Phonetic Association (IPA), Handbook.   The IPA is used by lexicographers, foreign language students and teachers, linguists, speech-language pathologists, singers, actors, constructed language creators and translators.The IPA is designed to represent only those qualities of speech that are part of oral language: phones, phonemes, intonation and the separation of words and syllables.

As a Crown Dependency, it is not subordinate to the government of the United Kingdom.  That government, however, is responsible for defence and external affairs and could intervene in the domestic affairs of the island under its residual responsibilities to guarantee "good government" in all Crown dependencies.  The Monarch of the United Kingdom is also the head of state of the Isle of Man, and generally referred to as "The Queen, Lord of Mann".   Legislation of the Isle of Man defines "the Crown in right of the Isle of Man" as separate from the "Crown in right of the United Kingdom". 

Economy of the Isle of Man<====>14767<====>Economy of the Isle of ManThe Isle of Man, one of the Crown dependencies, is a low-tax economy and offshore financial centre.  Located in the Irish Sea, it is within the British Isles but does not form part of the United Kingdom or the European Communities.  Insurance, online gambling operators and developers, ICT, and Offshore banking form key sectors of the island's  economy. As of 2016, the World Bank assessed the island's Gross National Income (GNI) per capita at US$89,970.   The Isle of Man Government's own National Income Report shows the largest sectors of the economy are insurance and eGaming with 17% of GNI each, followed by ICT and banking with 9% each, with tourist accommodation in the lowest sector at 0. 

Communications in the Isle of Man<====>14768<====>Communications in the Isle of Man The Isle of Man has an extensive communications infrastructure consisting of telephone cables, submarine cables, and an array of television and mobile phone transmitters and towers. TelecommunicationsTelegraphThe history of Manx telecommunications starts in 1859, when the Isle of Man Electric Telegraph Company was formed on the island with the intention of connecting across the island by telegraph, and allowing messages to be sent onwards to the UK.  In August 1859, a   long cable was commissioned from Glass, Elliot and Company of Greenwich and laid from Cranstal (north of Ramsey) to St Bees in Cumbria using the chartered cable ship Resolute. 

Transport in the Isle of Man<====>14769<====>Transport in the Isle of Man  There are a number of transport services around the Isle of Man, mostly consisting of paved roads, public transport, rail services, sea ports and an airport. Roads The island has a total of   of public roads,  all of which are paved.  Roads are numbered using a numbering scheme similar to the numbering schemes of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; each road is assigned a letter, which represents the road's category, followed by a 1 or 2 digit number.  A roads are the main roads of the island whilst roads labelled B, C, D or U decrease in size and/or quality. 

Information theory<====>14773<====>Information theory Information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information.   It was originally proposed by Claude E.  Shannon in 1948 to find fundamental limits on signal processing and communication operations such as data compression, in a landmark paper entitled "A Mathematical Theory of Communication".  Applications of fundamental topics of information theory include lossless data compression (e. g.  ZIP files), lossy data compression (e. g.  MP3s and JPEGs), and channel coding (e. g.  for digital subscriber line (DSL)).  Its impact has been crucial to the success of the Voyager missions to deep space, the invention of the compact disc, the feasibility of mobile phones, the development of the Internet, the study of linguistics and of human perception, the understanding of black holes, and numerous other fields. 

Information explosion<====>14774<====>Information explosionThe information explosion is the rapid increase in the amount of published information or data and the effects of this abundance.    As the amount of available data grows, the problem of managing the information becomes more difficult, which can lead to information overload.  The Online Oxford English Dictionary indicates use of the phrase in a March 1964 New Statesman article.   The New York Times first used the phrase in its editorial content in an article by Walter Sullivan on June 7, 1964, in which he described the phrase as "much discussed".  (p11. 

Inch<====>14775<====>Inch   The inch (abbreviation: in or ″) is a unit of length in the (British) imperial and United States customary systems of measurement now formally equal to   yard but usually understood as   of a foot.  Derived from the Roman uncia ("twelfth"), inch is also sometimes used to translate related units in other measurement systems, usually understood as deriving from the width of the human thumb.  Traditional standards for the exact length of an inch have varied in the past, but since the adoption of the international yard during the 1950s and 1960s it has been based on the metric system and defined as exactly 2. 

Inn<====>14776<====>InnInns are generally establishments or buildings where travelers can seek lodging and, usually, food and drink.  They are typically located in the country or along a highway; before the advent of motorized transportation they also provided accommodation for horses. HistoryInns in Europe were possibly first established when the Romans built their system of Roman roads two millennia ago.  Some inns in Europe are several centuries old.  In addition to providing for the needs of travelers, inns traditionally acted as community gathering places. Historically, inns in Europe provided not only food and lodging, but also stabling and fodder for the travelers' horses. 

International Olympiad in Informatics<====>14777<====>International Olympiad in Informatics The International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) is an annual competitive programming competition for secondary school students.  It is the second largest olympiad, after International Mathematical Olympiad, in terms of number of participating countries (IOI 2014 saw participation of 84 countries).  The first IOI was held in 1989 in Pravetz, Bulgaria. The contest consists of two days of computer programming and problem-solving of algorithmic nature.  To deal with problems involving very large amounts of data, it is necessary to have not only programmers, "but also creative coders, who can dream up what it is that the programmers need to tell the computer to do. 

Iota<====>14779<====>Iota Iota ( ; uppercase Ι, lowercase ι;  ) is the ninth letter of the Greek alphabet.  It was derived from the Phoenician letter Yodh.   Letters that arose from this letter include the Latin I and J, the Cyrillic І (І, і), Yi (Ї, ї), and Je (Ј, ј), and iotated letters (e. g.  Yu (Ю, ю)).  In the system of Greek numerals, iota has a value of 10.  Iota represents the sound  .  In ancient Greek it occurred in both long   and short   versions, but this distinction was lost in Koine Greek. 

Erectile dysfunction<====>14783<====>Erectile dysfunction    Erectile dysfunction (ED), also known as impotence, is a type of sexual dysfunction characterized by the inability to develop or maintain an erection of the penis during sexual activity.  Erectile dysfunction can have psychological consequences as it can be tied to relationship difficulties and self-image.   The most important organic causes of impotence are cardiovascular disease and diabetes, neurological problems (for example, trauma from prostatectomy surgery), hormonal insufficiencies (hypogonadism) and drug side effects.  Psychological impotence is where erection or penetration fails due to thoughts or feelings (psychological reasons) rather than physical impossibility; this is somewhat less frequent but can often be helped. 

Identity and change<====>14784<====>Identity and change The relationship between identity and change in the philosophical field of metaphysics seems, at first glance, deceptively simple, and belies the complexity of the issues involved.  ChangeWhen an object changes, it always changes in some particular way.   A baby grows up, and so changes in respect of size and maturity; a snake sheds its skin, and so changes in respect of its skin.  "Change" may therefore be defined as follows:An object, O, changes with respect to property, P, if and only if O has P at one time, and at a later time, O does not have P. 

Iran–Contra affair<====>14787<====>Iran–Contra affair  The Iran–Contra affair ( ,  ), also referred to as Irangate,  Contragate  or the Iran–Contra scandal, was a political scandal in the United States that occurred during the second term of the Reagan Administration.  Senior administration officials secretly facilitated the sale of arms to Iran, which was the subject of an arms embargo.   They hoped, thereby, to fund the Contras in Nicaragua while at the same time negotiating the release of several U. S.  hostages .  Under the Boland Amendment, further funding of the Contras by the government had been prohibited by Congress. 

Infocom<====>14788<====>InfocomInfocom was a software company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts that produced numerous works of interactive fiction.  They also produced one notable business application, a relational database called Cornerstone.  Infocom was founded on June 22, 1979 by MIT staff and students led by Dave Lebling, Marc Blank, Albert Vezza, and Joel Berez and lasted as an independent company until 1986 when it was bought by Activision.  Activision finally shut down the Infocom division in 1989, although they released some titles in the 1990s under the Infocom Zork brand.  Activision abandoned the Infocom trademark in 2002. 

Interactive fiction<====>14789<====>Interactive fiction Interactive fiction, often abbreviated IF, is software simulating environments in which players use text commands to control characters and influence the environment.  Works in this form can be understood as literary narratives, either in the form of Interactive narratives or Interactive narrations.  These works can also be understood as a form of video game,  either in the form of an adventure game or role-playing game.  In common usage, the term refers to text adventures, a type of adventure game where the entire interface can be "text-only",    however, Graphical text adventure games, where the text is accompanied by graphics (still images, animations or video) still fall under the text adventure category if the main way to interact with the game is by typing text. 

Ice hockey<====>14790<====>Ice hockey    Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points.  The sport is known to be fast-paced and physical, with teams usually consisting of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. Ice hockey is most popular in Canada, central and eastern Europe, Scandinavia, Russia and the United States. 

IEEE 802.3<====>14791<====>IEEE 802. 3 IEEE 802. 3 is a working group and a collection of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standards produced by the working group defining the physical layer and data link layer's media access control (MAC) of wired Ethernet.  This is generally a local area network (LAN) technology with some wide area network (WAN) applications.  Physical connections are made between nodes and/or infrastructure devices (hubs, switches, routers) by various types of copper or fiber cable. 802. 3 is a technology that supports the IEEE 802. 1 network architecture. 802. 3 also defines LAN access method using CSMA/CD. 

Integer (computer science)<====>14794<====>Integer (computer science)In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers.  Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values.  Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits).  The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers.  Computer hardware, including virtual machines, nearly always provide a way to represent a processor register or memory address as an integer. 

Icon<====>14800<====>Icon  An icon (from Greek   eikōn "image") is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting, from the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy, and certain Eastern Catholic churches.  The most common subjects include Christ, Mary, saints and/or angels.  Though especially associated with "portrait" style images concentrating on one or two main figures, the term also covers most religious images in a variety of artistic media produced by Eastern Christianity, including narrative scenes. Icons may also be cast in metal, carved in stone, embroidered on cloth, painted on wood, done in mosaic or fresco work, printed on paper or metal, etc. 

Icon (programming language)<====>14801<====>Icon (programming language)  Icon is a very high-level programming language featuring goal-directed execution and many facilities for managing strings and textual patterns.  It is related to SNOBOL and SL5, string processing languages.  Icon is not object-oriented, but an object-oriented extension called Idol was developed in 1996 which eventually became Unicon. Basic syntaxThe Icon language is derived from the ALGOL-class of structured programming languages, and thus has syntax similar to C or Pascal.  Icon is most similar to Pascal, using  :=  syntax for assignments, the  procedure  keyword and similar syntax.  On the other hand, Icon uses C-style brackets for structuring execution groups, and programs start by running a procedure called "main". 

Iconology<====>14802<====>IconologyIconology is a method of interpretation in cultural history and the history of art used by Aby Warburg, Erwin Panofsky and their followers that uncovers the cultural, social, and historical background of themes and subjects in the visual arts.   It is derived from synthesis rather than scattered analysis and examines symbolic meaning on more than its face value by reconciling it with its historical context and with the artist's body of work  – in contrast to the widely descriptive iconography, which, as described by Panofsky, is an approach to studying the content and meaning of works of art that is primarily focused on classifying, establishing dates, provenance and other necessary fundamental knowledge concerning the subject matter of an artwork that is needed for further interpretation. 

List of Indian massacres<====>14804<====>List of Indian massacres  In the history of the European colonization of North America, an atrocity termed "Indian massacre" is a specific incident wherein a group of people (military, mob or other) deliberately kill a significant number of relatively defenseless or innocent people—usually civilian noncombatants or to the summary execution of prisoners-of-war.   The term refers to the killings of Euro-Americans by Native Americans (Indians) as well as to killings of Native Americans by Euro-Americans and/or by other Native Americans.Overview"Indian massacre" is a phrase whose use and definition has evolved and expanded over time. 

Islamic calendar<====>14810<====>Islamic calendar    The Islamic, Muslim, or Hijri calendar (  at-taqwīm al-hijrī) is a lunar calendar consisting of 12 months in a year of 354 or 355 days.  It is used (often alongside the Gregorian calendar) to date events in many Muslim countries.  It is also used by Muslims to determine the proper days of Islamic holidays and rituals, such as the annual period of fasting and the proper time for the pilgrimage to Mecca. The Islamic calendar employs the Hijri era whose epoch was retrospectively established as the Islamic New Year of AD 622.  During that year, Muhammad and his followers migrated from Mecca to Yathrib (now Medina) and established the first Muslim community (ummah), an event commemorated as the Hijra. 

Interquartile range<====>14812<====>Interquartile range In descriptive statistics, the interquartile range (IQR), also called the midspread or middle 50%, or technically H-spread, is a measure of statistical dispersion, being equal to the difference between 75th and 25th percentiles, or between upper and lower quartiles,   IQR = Q 3  −  Q 1 .  In other words, the IQR is the first quartile subtracted from the third quartile; these quartiles can be clearly seen on a box plot on the data.  It is a trimmed estimator, defined as the 25% trimmed range, and is the most significant basic robust measure of scale. 

Indiana Jones<====>14814<====>Indiana Jones   Dr.  Henry Walton "Indiana" Jones Jr.  is a title character and protagonist of the Indiana Jones franchise.  George Lucas created the character in homage to the action heroes of 1930s film serials.  The character first appeared in the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark, to be followed by Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom in 1984, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade in 1989, The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles from 1992 to 1996, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in 2008.  The character is also featured in novels, comics, video games, and other media. 

Irreducible fraction<====>14822<====>Irreducible fractionAn irreducible fraction (or fraction in lowest terms or reduced fraction) is a fraction in which the numerator and denominator are integers that have no other common divisors than 1 (and -1, when negative numbers are considered).   In other words, a fraction  a ⁄ b  is irreducible if and only if a and b are coprime, that is, if a and b have a greatest common divisor of 1.  In higher mathematics, "irreducible fraction" may also refer to rational fractions such that the numerator and the denominator are coprime polynomials.   Every positive rational number can be represented as an irreducible fraction in exactly one way. 

Isomorphism class<====>14826<====>Isomorphism class An isomorphism class is a collection of mathematical objects isomorphic to each other.  Isomorphism classes are often defined if the exact identity of the elements of the set is considered irrelevant, and the properties of the structure of the mathematical object are studied.   Examples of this are ordinals and graphs.   However, there are circumstances in which the isomorphism class of an object conceals vital internal information about it; consider these examples:The associative algebras consisting of coquaternions and 2 × 2 real matrices are isomorphic as rings.  Yet they appear in different contexts for application (plane mapping and kinematics) so the isomorphism is insufficient to merge the concepts. 

Isomorphism<====>14828<====>Isomorphism  In mathematics, an isomorphism (from the Ancient Greek:   isos "equal", and   morphe "form" or "shape") is a homomorphism or morphism (i. e.  a mathematical mapping) that admits an inverse.  For clarity, by inverse is meant inverse homomorphism or inverse morphism respectively, not inverse function.   Two mathematical objects are isomorphic if an isomorphism exists between them.   An automorphism is an isomorphism whose source and target coincide.   The interest of isomorphisms lies in the fact that two isomorphic objects cannot be distinguished by using only the properties used to define morphisms; thus isomorphic objects may be considered the same as long as one considers only these properties and their consequences. 

Infinite descending chain<====>14829<====>Infinite descending chainGiven a set S with a partial order ≤, an infinite descending chain is an infinite, strictly decreasing sequence of elements x 1  > x 2  > . . .  > x n  > . . . As an example, in the set of integers, the chain −1, −2, −3, . . .  is an infinite descending chain, but there exists no infinite descending chain on the natural numbers, as every chain of natural numbers has a minimal element. If a partially ordered set does not possess any infinite descending chains, it is said then, that it satisfies the descending chain condition. 

Intergovernmental organization<====>14832<====>Intergovernmental organizationAn intergovernmental organization or international governmental organisation (IGO) is an organization composed primarily of sovereign states (referred to as member states), or of other intergovernmental organizations.  Intergovernmental organizations are  called international organizations, although that term may also include international nongovernmental organization such as international nonprofit organizations or multinational corporations.  Intergovernmental organizations are an important aspect of public international law.  IGOs are established by treaty that acts as a charter creating the group.  Treaties are formed when lawful representatives (governments) of several states go through a ratification process, providing the IGO with an international legal personality. 

International Telecommunication Union<====>14836<====>International Telecommunication UnionThe International Telecommunication Union (ITU;   (UIT)), originally the International Telegraph Union ( ), is a specialized agency of the United Nations (UN) that is responsible for issues that concern information and communication technologies.  The ITU coordinates the shared global use of the radio spectrum, promotes international cooperation in assigning satellite orbits, works to improve telecommunication infrastructure in the developing world, and assists in the development and coordination of worldwide technical standards.  The ITU is active in areas including broadband Internet, latest-generation wireless technologies, aeronautical and maritime navigation, radio astronomy, satellite-based meteorology, convergence in fixed-mobile phone, Internet access, data, voice, TV broadcasting, and next-generation networks. 

Internet Message Access Protocol<====>14837<====>Internet Message Access Protocol  In computing, the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is an Internet standard protocol used by e-mail clients to retrieve e-mail messages from a mail server over a TCP/IP connection.IMAP is defined by RFC 3501. IMAP was designed with the goal of permitting complete management of an email box by multiple email clients, therefore clients generally leave messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them.  An IMAP server typically listens on port number 143.  IMAP over SSL (IMAPS) is assigned the port number 993. Virtually all modern e-mail clients and servers support IMAP. 

Inertial frame of reference<====>14838<====>Inertial frame of reference    An inertial frame of reference, in classical physics, is a frame of reference in which bodies, whose net force acting upon them is zero, are not accelerated; that is they are at rest or they move at a constant velocity in a straight line.   In analytical terms, it is a frame of reference that describes time and space homogeneously, isotropically, and in a time-independent manner.Conceptually, in classical physics and special relativity, the physics of a system in an inertial frame have no causes external to the system. 

Illuminati: New World Order<====>14840<====>Illuminati: New World Order  Illuminati: New World Order (INWO) is a collectible card game (CCG) that was released in 1994  by Steve Jackson Games, based on their original boxed game Illuminati, which in turn was inspired by the 1975 book The Illuminatus! Trilogy by Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea.   INWO won the Origins Award for Best Card Game in 1997. Goal of the gamePlayers attempt to achieve World Domination by utilizing the powers of their chosen Illuminati (the Adepts of Hermes, the Bavarian Illuminati, the Bermuda Triangle, the Discordian Society, the Gnomes of Zürich, The Network, the Servants of Cthulhu, Shangri-La, and the UFOs). 

Interstellar travel<====>14843<====>Interstellar travel Interstellar travel is the term used for hypothetical crewed or uncrewed travel between stars or planetary systems.  Interstellar travel will be much more difficult than interplanetary spaceflight; the distances between the planets in the Solar System are less than 30 astronomical units (AU)—whereas the distances between stars are typically hundreds of thousands of AU, and usually expressed in light-years.  Because of the vastness of those distances, interstellar travel would require a high percentage of the speed of light; huge travel time, lasting from decades to millennia or longer; or a combination of both. The speeds required for interstellar travel in a human lifetime far exceed what current methods of spacecraft propulsion can provide. 

Interior Gateway Routing Protocol<====>14844<====>Interior Gateway Routing Protocol Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) is a distance vector interior gateway protocol (IGP) developed by Cisco.  It is used by routers to exchange routing data within an autonomous system. IGRP is a proprietary protocol.   IGRP was created in part to overcome the limitations of RIP (maximum hop count of only 15, and a single routing metric) when used within large networks.  IGRP supports multiple metrics for each route, including bandwidth, delay, load, and reliability; to compare two routes these metrics are combined together into a single metric, using a formula which can be adjusted through the use of pre-set constants. 

Indo-European languages<====>14848<====>Indo-European languages   The Indo-European languages  are a language family of several hundred related languages and dialects.  There are about 445 living Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by Ethnologue, with over two thirds (313) of them belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch.   The most widely spoken Indo-European languages by native speakers are Spanish, English, Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu), Portuguese, Bengali, Punjabi, Russian, each with over 100 million speakers, with German, French, and Persian also having significant numbers.  Today, about 46% of the human population speaks an Indo-European language as a first language, by far the highest of any language family. 

Illinois<====>14849<====>Illinois    Illinois (   ) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States.  It is the 6th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country.With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub.  The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois Waterway. 

Ian Murdock<====>14851<====>Ian Murdock Ian Ashley Murdock (28 April 1973  28 December 2015) was an American software engineer, known for being the founder of the Debian project and Progeny Linux Systems, a commercial Linux company. Life and careerAlthough Murdock's parents were both from Southern Indiana,  he was born in Konstanz, West Germany, on 28 April 1973, where his father was pursuing postdoctoralresearch.  The family returned to the United States in 1975, and Murdock grew up in Lafayette, Indiana, beginning in 1977 when his father became a professor of entomology at Purdue University.  Murdock graduated from Harrison High School in 1991,  and then earned his bachelor's degree in computer science from Purdue in 1996. 

Inner product space<====>14856<====>Inner product space  In linear algebra, an inner product space is a vector space with an additional structure called an inner product.  This additional structure associates each pair of vectors in the space with a scalar quantity known as the inner product of the vectors.  Inner products allow the rigorous introduction of intuitive geometrical notions such as the length of a vector or the angle between two vectors.  They also provide the means of defining orthogonality between vectors (zero inner product).  Inner product spaces generalize Euclidean spaces (in which the inner product is the dot product, also known as the scalar product) to vector spaces of any (possibly infinite) dimension, and are studied in functional analysis. 

Iain Banks<====>14858<====>Iain Banks   Iain Banks (16 February 1954 – 9 June 2013) was a Scottish author.  He wrote mainstream fiction under the name Iain Banks and science fiction as Iain M.  Banks, including the initial of his adopted middle name Menzies ( ). After the publication and success of The Wasp Factory (1984), Banks began to write on a full-time basis.  His first science fiction book, Consider Phlebas, was released in 1987, marking the start of the popular Culture series.  His books have been adapted for theatre, radio and television.  In 2008, The Times named Banks in their list of "The 50 greatest British writers since 1945". 

Incunable<====>14863<====>Incunable An incunable, or sometimes incunabulum (plural incunables or incunabula, respectively), is a book, pamphlet, or broadside (such as the Almanach cracoviense ad annum 1474) that was printed—not handwritten—before the year 1501 in Europe.  As of 2014, there are about 30,000 distinct incunable editions known to be extant, while the number of surviving copies in Germany alone is estimated at around 125,000.   Etymology"Incunable" is the anglicised singular form of incunabula, Latin for "swaddling clothes" or "cradle",  which can refer to "the earliest stages or first traces in the development of anything".   A former term for "incunable" is "fifteener",  referring to the 15th century. 

Isotropy<====>14865<====>Isotropy  Isotropy is uniformity in all orientations; it is derived from the Greek isos (ἴσος, "equal") and tropos (τρόπος, "way").  Precise definitions depend on the subject area.   Exceptions, or inequalities, are frequently indicated by the prefix an, hence anisotropy.  Anisotropy is also used to describe situations where properties vary systematically, dependent on direction.  Isotropic radiation has the same intensity regardless of the direction of measurement, and an isotropic field exerts the same action regardless of how the test particle is oriented. MathematicsWithin mathematics, isotropy has a few different meanings:Isotropic manifoldsA manifold is isotropic if the geometry on the manifold is the same regardless of direction. 

International Mathematical Union<====>14868<====>International Mathematical Union The International Mathematical Union (IMU) is an international non-governmental organisation devoted to international cooperation in the field of mathematics across the world.  It is a member of the International Council for Science (ICSU) and supports the International Congress of Mathematicians.  Its members are national mathematics organizations from more than 80 countries.  The objectives of the International Mathematical Union (IMU) are to promote international cooperation in mathematics.  By supporting and assisting the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) and other international scientific meetings/conferences.  To acknowledge outstanding research contributions to mathematics, through the awarding of scientific prizes and to encourage and support other international mathematical activities, considered likely to contribute to the development of mathematical science in any of its aspects, whether pure, applied, or educational. 

International Council for Science<====>14869<====>International Council for Science  The International Council for Science (ICSU, after its former name, International Council of Scientific Unions) is an international organization devoted to international cooperation in the advancement of science.  Its members are national scientific bodies and international scientific unions.  As of 2017, it comprises 122 multi-disciplinary National Scientific Members, Associates and Observers representing 142 countries and 31 international, disciplinary Scientific Unions.  ICSU also has 22 Scientific Associates.  Mission and principles"ICSU’s mission is to strengthen international science for the benefit of society.  To do this, ICSU mobilizes the knowledge and resources of the international scientific community to:Identify and address major issues of importance to science and society. 

International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry<====>14870<====>International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry   The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)   or   is an international federation of National Adhering Organizations that represents chemists in individual countries.  It is a member of the International Council for Science (ICSU).IUPAC is registered in Zürich, Switzerland, and the administrative office, known as the "IUPAC Secretariat", is in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, United States.  This administrative office is headed by IUPAC's executive director,  currently Lynn Soby.  IUPAC was established in 1919 as the successor of the International Congress of Applied Chemistry for the advancement of chemistry. 

International Hydrographic Organization<====>14871<====>International Hydrographic Organization The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) is the inter-governmental organisation representing hydrography.  A principal aim of the IHO is to ensure that the world’s seas, oceans and navigable waters are properly surveyed and charted.   It does this through the setting of international standards, the co-ordination of the endeavours of the world's national hydrographic offices, and through its capacity building programme.  The IHO enjoys observer status at the United Nations where it is the recognised competent authority on hydrographic surveying and nautical charting.  When referring to hydrography and nautical charting in Conventions and similar Instruments, it is the IHO standards and specifications that are normally used. 

IBM mainframe<====>14872<====>IBM mainframe IBM mainframes are large computer systems produced by IBM since 1952.  During the 1960s and 1970s, the term mainframe computer was almost synonymous with IBM products due to their market share.  Current mainframes in IBM's line of business computers are developments of the basic design of the IBM System/360. First and second generationFrom 1952 into the late 1960s, IBM manufactured and marketed several large computer models, known as the IBM 700/7000 series.  The first-generation 700s were based on vacuum tubes, while the later, second-generation 7000s used transistors.  These machines established IBM's dominance in electronic data processing ("EDP"). 

Iowa State University<====>14875<====>Iowa State University   Iowa State University of Science and Technology, generally referred to as Iowa State, is a public flagship  land-grant and space-grant research university located in Ames, Iowa, United States.  It is the largest university in the state of Iowa and the 3rd largest university in the Big 12 athletic conference.   Iowa State is classified as a Research University with very high research activity (RU/VH) by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.Iowa State is also a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU), which consists of 62 leading research universities in North America. 

International Astronomical Union<====>14878<====>International Astronomical Union   The International Astronomical Union (IAU;  , UAI) is an international association of professional astronomers, at the PhD level and beyond, active in professional research and education in astronomy.   Among other activities, it acts as the internationally recognized authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies (stars, planets, asteroids, etc. ) and any surface features on them.  The IAU is a member of the International Council for Science (ICSU).  Its main objective is to promote and safeguard the science of astronomy in all its aspects through international cooperation.  The IAU maintains friendly relations with organizations that include amateur astronomers in their membership. 

International Criminal Court<====>14880<====>International Criminal Court  The International Criminal Court (ICC or ICCt)  is an intergovernmental organization and international tribunal that sits in The Hague in the Netherlands.  The ICC has the jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for the international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.  The ICC is intended to complement existing national judicial systems and it may therefore only exercise its jurisdiction when certain conditions are met, such as when national courts are unwilling or unable to prosecute criminals or when the United Nations Security Council or individual states refer situations to the Court.  The ICC began functioning on 1 July 2002, the date that the Rome Statute entered into force. 

Iberian Peninsula<====>14883<====>Iberian Peninsula    The Iberian Peninsula  ,  also known as Iberia  ,  is located in the southwest corner of Europe.   The peninsula is principally divided between Portugal and Spain, comprising most of their territory.   It also includes Andorra, and a small part of France along the peninsula's northeastern edge, as well as Gibraltar on its south coast, a small peninsula that forms an overseas territory of the United Kingdom.   With an area of approximately  , it is the second largest European peninsula, after the Scandinavian. NameGreek nameThe English word Iberia was adapted from the use of the Ancient Greek word Ἰβηρία ( ) by Greek geographers under the rule of the Roman Empire to refer to what is known today in English as the Iberian Peninsula. 

Intermediate value theorem<====>14884<====>Intermediate value theorem In mathematical analysis, the intermediate value theorem states that if a continuous function, f, with an interval, [a, b], as its domain, takes values f(a) and f(b) at each end of the interval, then it also takes any value between f(a) and f(b) at some point within the interval. This has two important corollaries: If a continuous function has values of opposite sign inside an interval, then it has a root in that interval (Bolzano's theorem).   The image of a continuous function over an interval is itself an interval. MotivationThis captures an intuitive property of continuous functions: given f continuous on [1, 2] with the known values f(1) = 3 and f(2) = 5. 

Iran–Iraq War<====>14889<====>Iran–Iraq WarThe Iran–Iraq War was an armed conflict between Iran and Iraq lasting from 22 September 1980, when Iraq invaded Iran, to 20 August 1988.  The war followed a long history of border disputes, and was motivated by fears that the Iranian Revolution in 1979 would inspire insurgency among Iraq's Shi'ite majority, as well as Iraq's desire to replace Iran as the dominant Persian Gulf state.  Iraq planned to annex the oil-rich Khuzestan Province and the east bank of the Shatt al-Arab (Arvand Rud). Although Iraq hoped to take advantage of Iran's revolutionary chaos and attacked without formal warning, it made only limited progress into Iran and was quickly repelled; Iran regained virtually all lost territory by June 1982. 

Incremental reading<====>14891<====>Incremental readingIncremental reading is a software-assisted method for learning and retaining information from reading, helping with the creation of flashcards out of electronic articles read in portions inside a prioritized reading list. It is particularly targeted to people who are trying to learn for life a large amount of information, particularly if that information comes from various sources. "Incremental reading" means "reading in portions".  Instead of a linear reading of articles one at a time, the method works by keeping a large reading list of electronic articles or books (often dozens or hundreds of them) and reading parts of several articles in each session. 

Intelligence quotient<====>14892<====>Intelligence quotient    An intelligence quotient (IQ) is a total score derived from several standardized tests designed to assess human intelligence.  The abbreviation "IQ" was coined by the psychologist William Stern for the German term Intelligenzquotient, his term for a scoring method for intelligence tests at University of Breslau he advocated in a 1912 book.   Historically, IQ is a score obtained by dividing a person’s mental age score, obtained by administering an intelligence test, by the person’s chronological age, both expressed in terms of years and months.  The resulting fraction is multiplied by 100 to obtain the IQ score. 

Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur<====>14894<====>Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur   Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (also known as IIT Kanpur or IITK) is a public engineering institution located in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh.  It was declared to be an Institute of National Importance by the Government of India under the Institutes of Technology Act. Established in 1959 as one of the first Indian Institutes of Technology, the institute was created with the assistance of a consortium of nine US research universities as part of the Kanpur Indo-American Programme (KIAP).   History IIT Kanpur was established by an Act of Parliament in 1959. 

Insulin<====>14895<====>Insulin   Insulin (from Latin insula, island) is a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreatic islets, and it is considered to be the main anabolic hormone of the body.It regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and protein by promoting the absorption of, especially, glucose from the blood into fat, liver and skeletal muscle cells. In these tissues the absorbed glucose is converted into either glycogen via glycogenesis or fats (triglycerides) via lipogenesis, or, in the case of the liver, into both.    Glucose production and secretion by the liver is strongly inhibited by high concentrations of insulin in the blood. 

Inductor<====>14896<====>Inductor  An inductor, also called a coil, choke or reactor, is a passive two-terminal electrical component that stores electrical energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through it.    An inductor typically consists of an insulated wire wound into a coil around a core.  When the current flowing through an inductor changes, the time-varying magnetic field induces a voltage in the conductor, described by Faraday's law of induction.  According to Lenz's law, the direction of induced electromotive force (e. m. f. ) opposes the change in current that created it.  As a result, inductors oppose any changes in current through them. 

Insulin pump<====>14899<====>Insulin pump   An insulin pump is a medical device used for the administration of insulin in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, also known as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy. The device configuration may vary depending on design.   A traditional pump includes:the pump (including controls, processing module, and batteries)a disposable reservoir for insulin (inside the pump)a disposable infusion set, including a cannula for subcutaneous insertion (under the skin) and a tubing system to interface the insulin reservoir to the cannula. Other configurations are possible.  For instance, more recent models may include disposable or semi-disposable designs for the pumping mechanism and may eliminate tubing from the infusion set. 

ISO 3166<====>14900<====>ISO 3166 ISO 3166 is a standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that defines codes for the names of countries, dependent territories, special areas of geographical interest, and their principal subdivisions (e. g. , provinces or states).  The official name of the standard is Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions. PartsIt consists of three parts: ISO 3166-1, Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions – Part 1: Country codes, defines codes for the names of countries, dependent territories, and special areas of geographical interest.  It defines three sets of country codes:ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 – two-letter country codes which are the most widely used of the three, and used most prominently for the Internet's country code top-level domains (with a few exceptions, e. 

Intensive insulin therapy<====>14904<====>Intensive insulin therapy Intensive insulin therapy or flexible insulin therapy is a therapeutic regimen for diabetes mellitus treatment.   This newer approach contrasts with conventional insulinotherapy.   Rather than minimize the number of insulin injections per day (a technique which demands a rigid schedule for food and activities), the intensive approach favors flexible meal times with variable carbohydrate as well as flexible physical activities.   The trade-off is the increase from 2 or 3 injections per day to 4 or more injections per day, which was considered "intensive" relative to the older approach.  In North America in 2004, many endocrinologists prefer the term "flexible insulin therapy" (FIT) to "intensive therapy" and use it to refer to any method of replacing insulin that attempts to mimic the pattern of small continuous basal insulin secretion of a working pancreas combined with larger insulin secretions at mealtimes. 

Interwiki links<====>14906<====>Interwiki links  Interwiki linking (W-link) is a facility for creating links to the many wikis on the World Wide Web.  Users avoid pasting in entire URLs (as they would for regular web pages) and instead use a shorthand similar to links within the same wiki (intrawiki links). Unlike domain names on the Internet, there is no globally defined list of interwiki prefixes, so owners of a wiki must define an interwiki map (InterMap) appropriate to their needs.   Users generally have to create separate accounts for each wiki they intend to use (unless they intend to edit anonymously). 

Inverse function<====>14907<====>Inverse function In mathematics, an inverse function (or anti-function ) is a function that "reverses" another function: if the function   applied to an input   gives a result of  , then applying its inverse function   to   gives the result  , and vice versa.  I. e. ,   if and only if  .   As a simple example, consider the real-valued function of a real variable given by  .  Thinking of this as a step-by-step procedure (namely, take a number  , multiply it by 5, then subtract 7 from the result), to reverse this and get   back from some output value, say  , we should undo each step in reverse order. 

Inertia<====>14909<====>Inertia    Inertia is the resistance of any physical object to any change in its state of motion.  This includes changes to the object's speed, direction, or state of rest.  Inertia is also defined as the tendency of objects to keep moving in a straight line at a constant velocity.  The principle of inertia is one of the fundamental principles in classical physics that are still used to describe the motion of objects and how they are affected by the applied forces on them.  Inertia comes from the Latin word, iners, meaning idle, sluggish. 

Ibanez<====>14910<====>Ibanez    is a Japanese guitar brand owned by Hoshino Gakki.   Based in Nagoya, Aichi, Japan, Hoshino Gakki were one of the first Japanese musical instrument companies to gain a significant foothold in import guitar sales in the United States and Europe, as well as the first brand of guitars to mass-produce the seven-string guitar and eight-string guitar.  Ibanez manufactures effects, accessories, amps, and instruments in Japan, China, Indonesia and in the United States (at a Los Angeles-based custom shop).  Currently, there are nearly 165 models of bass guitar, 130 acoustic guitars, and more than 300 electric guitars. 

Incest<====>14912<====>Incest   Incest is sexual activity  between family members or close relatives.   This typically includes sexual activity between people in a consanguineous relationship (blood relations), and sometimes those related by affinity, stepfamily, those related by adoption or marriage, or members of the same clan or lineage. The incest taboo is and has been one of the most widespread of all cultural taboos, both in present and in many past societies.Most modern societies have laws regarding incest or social restrictions on closely consanguineous marriages.   In societies where it is illegal, consensual adult incest is seen by some as a victimless crime. 

Industrial Revolution<====>14914<====>Industrial Revolution   The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840.  This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, the increasing use of steam power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system. Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested.  The textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods.    The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, and many of the technological innovations were British. 

International Court of Justice<====>14918<====>International Court of JusticeThe International Court of Justice (abbreviated ICJ; commonly referred to as the World Court)  is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations (UN).  It settles legal disputes between member states and gives advisory opinions to authorized UN organs and specialized agencies.  It comprises a panel of 15 judges elected by the General Assembly and Security Council for nine-year terms.  It is seated in the Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands.  ActivitiesEstablished in 1945 by the UN Charter, the court began work in 1946 as the successor to the Permanent Court of International Justice. 

International Standard Book Number<====>14919<====>International Standard Book Number    The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a unique   numeric commercial book identifier. An ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a book.  For example, an e-book, a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different ISBN.  The ISBN is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007.  The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-based and varies from country to country, often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country. 

IP address<====>14921<====>IP address    An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.  RFC 760, DOD Standard Internet Protocol (January 1980)   An IP address serves two principal functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing. Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) defines an IP address as a 32-bit number.   However, because of the growth of the Internet and the depletion of available IPv4 addresses, a new version of IP (IPv6), using 128 bits for the IP address, was developed in 1995, RFC 1883, Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification, S. 

If and only if<====>14922<====>If and only if In logic and related fields such as mathematics and philosophy, if and only if (shortened iff) is a biconditional logical connective between statements. In that it is biconditional, the connective can be likened to the standard material conditional ("only if", equal to "if . . .  then") combined with its reverse ("if"); hence the name.  The result is that the truth of either one of the connected statements requires the truth of the other (i. e.  either both statements are true, or both are false).  It is controversial whether the connective thus defined is properly rendered by the English "if and only if", with its pre-existing meaning. 

List of Italian dishes<====>14926<====>List of Italian dishes   This is a list of Italian dishes and foods.  Italian cuisine has developed through centuries of social and political changes, with roots as far back as the 4th century BC.  Italian cuisine has its origins in Etruscan, ancient Greek, and ancient Roman cuisines. Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers and maize, now central to the cuisine but not introduced in quantity until the 18th century.    The cuisine of Italy is noted for its regional diversity,    abundance of difference in taste, and is known to be one of the most popular in the world,  with influences abroad. 

Isaac Ambrose<====>14928<====>Isaac AmbroseIsaac Ambrose (1604 – 20 January 1664) was an English Puritan divine.  He graduated with a BA.  from Brasenose College, Oxford, on 1624.  He obtained the curacy of St Edmund’s Church, Castleton, Derbyshire, in 1627.  He was one of king's four preachers in Lancashire in 1631.  He was twice imprisoned by commissioners of array.  He worked for establishment of Presbyterianism; successively at Leeds, Preston, and Garstang, whence he was ejected for nonconformity in 1662.  He also published religious works. BiographyAmbrose was born in 1604.  He was the son of Richard Ambrose, vicar of Ormskirk, and was probably descended from the Ambroses of Lowick in Furness, a well-known Roman Catholic family. 

International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling<====>14933<====>International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling  The International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling is an international environmental agreement signed in 1946 in order to "provide for the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry".   It governs the commercial, scientific, and aboriginal subsistence whaling practices of fifty-nine member nations. It was signed by 15 nations in Washington, D. C.  on 2 December 1946  and took effect on 10 November 1948.  Its protocol (which represented the first substantial revision of the convention and extended the definition of a "whale-catcher" to include helicopters as well as ships) was signed in Washington on 19 November 1956. 

International Organization for Standardization<====>14934<====>International Organization for Standardization   The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an international standard-setting body composed of representatives from various national standards organizations. Founded on 23 February 1947, the organization promotes worldwide proprietary, industrial and commercial standards.  It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland,    and as of March 2017 works in 162 countries.  It was one of the first organizations granted general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. OverviewThe International Organization for Standardization, is an independent, non-governmental organization, the members of which are the standards organizations of the 163  member countries. 

Individualist anarchism<====>14936<====>Individualist anarchism    Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their will over external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.  "What do I mean by individualism?I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience. "Mini-Manual of Individualism by Han Ryner    "I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty.  To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself. 

Italo Calvino<====>14937<====>Italo Calvino  Italo Calvino ( ;  .  RAI (circa 1970), retrieved 25 October 2012.   15 October 1923 – 19 September 1985) was an Italian journalist and writer of short stories and novels.  His best known works include the Our Ancestors trilogy (1952–1959), the Cosmicomics collection of short stories (1965), and the novels Invisible Cities (1972) and If on a winter's night a traveler (1979). Admired in Britain, Australia and the United States, he was the most-translated contemporary Italian writer at the time of his death.  BiographyParentsItalo Calvino was born in Santiago de las Vegas, a suburb of Havana, Cuba, in 1923. 

Intercontinental ballistic missile<====>14939<====>Intercontinental ballistic missile  An intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) is a guided ballistic missile with a minimum range of    primarily designed for nuclear weapons delivery (delivering one or more thermonuclear warheads).  Similarly, conventional, chemical, and biological weapons can also be delivered with varying effectiveness, but have never been deployed on ICBMs.  Most modern designs support multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), allowing a single missile to carry several warheads, each of which can strike a different target. Early ICBMs had limited precision, which made them suitable for use only against the largest targets, such as cities. 

Irish traditional music session<====>14943<====>Irish traditional music session Irish traditional music sessions are mostly informal gatherings at which people play Irish traditional music.   The Irish language word for "session" is seisiún.  This article discusses tune-playing, although "session" can also refer to a singing session or a mixed session (tunes and songs). Barry Foy's Field Guide to the Irish Music Session defines a session as:  . . . a gathering of Irish traditional musicians for the purpose of celebrating their common interest in the music by playing it together in a relaxed, informal setting, while in the process generally beefing up the mystical cultural mantra that hums along uninterruptedly beneath all manifestations of Irishness worldwide. 

Ice<====>14946<====>Ice    Ice is water frozen into a solid state.  Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air , it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color. In the Solar System, ice is abundant and occurs naturally from as close to the Sun as Mercury to as far away as the Oort cloud objects.  Beyond the Solar System, it occurs as interstellar ice.  It is abundant on Earth's surface particularly in the polar regions and above the snow line  and, as a common form of precipitation and deposition, plays a key role in Earth's water cycle and climate. 

Ionic bonding<====>14951<====>Ionic bondingIonic bonding is a type of chemical bond that involves the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, and is the primary interaction occurring in ionic compounds.  The ions are atoms that have gained one or more electrons (known as anions, which are negatively charged) and atoms that have lost one or more electrons (known as cations, which are positively charged).  This transfer of electrons is known as electrovalence in contrast to covalence.  In the simplest case, the cation is a metal atom and the anion is a nonmetal atom, but these ions can be of a more complex nature, e. 

Immune system<====>14958<====>Immune system The immune system is a host defense system comprising many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease.  To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue.  In many species, the immune system can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity.   In humans, the blood–brain barrier, blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid–brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system, which protects the brain. 

Immunology<====>14959<====>Immunology   Immunology is a branch of biology that covers the study of immune systems in all organisms.   The Russian biologist Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov advanced studies on immunology and received the Nobel Prize for his work in 1908.  He pinned small thorns into starfish larvae and noticed unusual cells surrounding the thorns.  This was the active response of the body trying to maintain its integrity.  It was Mechnikov who first observed the phenomenon of phagocytosis, in which the body defends itself against a foreign body, and coined the term.  Immunology charts, measures, and contextualizes the: physiological functioning of the immune system in states of both health and diseases; malfunctions of the immune system in immunological disorders (such as autoimmune diseases, hypersensitivities, immune deficiency, and transplant rejection); the physical, chemical and physiological characteristics of the components of the immune system in vitro, in situ, and in vivo. 

Ice beer<====>14961<====>Ice beer Ice beer is a marketing term for pale lager beer brands which have undergone some degree of fractional freezing somewhat similar to the German Eisbock production method.  These brands generally have higher alcohol content than typical beer and generally have a low price relative to their alcohol content.  ProcessThe process of "icing" beer involves lowering the temperature of a batch of beer until ice crystals form.  Since ethanol has a much lower freezing point (-114 °C; -173. 2 °F) than water (0 °C; 32 °F), when the ice is removed, the alcohol concentration of the beer increases.  The process is known as fractional freezing or freeze distillation. 

Identity element<====>14962<====>Identity element In mathematics, an identity element or neutral element is a special type of element of a set with respect to a binary operation on that set, which leaves other elements unchanged when combined with them.  This concept is used in algebraic structures such as groups and rings.  The term identity element is often shortened to identity (as will be done in this article) when there is no possibility of confusion, however, the identity implicitly depends on the binary operation it is coupled with.  Let   be a set   with a binary operation ∗ on it. 

International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1983<====>14963<====>International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1983The International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA, 1983) is an agreement to provide an effective framework for cooperation between tropical timber producers and consumers and to encourage the development of national policies aimed at sustainable utilization and conservation of tropical forests and their genetic resources.The International Tropical Timber Organization was established under this agreement.Opened for signature - November 18, 1983Entered into force - April 1, 1985; this agreement expired when the International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1994, went into force.PartiesFifty eight parties signed up to the agreement:Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Cameroon, Canada, People's Republic of China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, European Union, Fiji, Finland, France, Gabon, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Guyana, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Liberia, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, United Kingdom, United States, VenezuelaReferences External linksInternational Tropical Timber OrganizationDEFAULTSORT

International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1994<====>14964<====>International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1994International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1994 (ITTA, 1994 or ITTA2) was drafted to ensure that by the year 2000 exports of tropical timber originated from sustainably managed sources and to establish a fund to assist tropical timber producers in obtaining the resources necessary to reach this objective. It defined the mandate of the International Tropical Timber Organization. The agreement was opened for signature on January 26, 1994, and entered into force on January 1, 1997. It replaced the International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1983, and was superseded by the International Tropical Timber Agreement, 2006.

Instrumental<====>14967<====>Instrumental  An instrumental is a musical composition or recording without lyrics, or singing, although it might include some inarticulate vocals, such as shouted backup vocals in a Big Band setting.  The music is primarily or exclusively produced by musical instruments.  An instrumental can exist in music notation, after it is written by a composer; in the mind of the composer (especially in cases where the composer himself will perform the piece, as in the case of a blues solo guitarist or a folk music fiddle player); as a piece that is performed live by a single instrumentalist or a musical ensemble, which could range in size from a duo or trio to a large Big Band, concert band or orchestra. 

Regular icosahedron<====>14968<====>Regular icosahedron  In geometry, a regular icosahedron (  or   ) is a convex polyhedron with 20 faces, 30 edges and 12 vertices.  It is one of the five Platonic solids, and the one with the most sides. It has five equilateral triangular faces meeting at each vertex.  It is represented by its Schläfli symbol {3,5}, or sometimes by its vertex figure as 3. 3. 3. 3. 3 or 3 5 .  It is the dual of the dodecahedron, which is represented by {5,3}, having three pentagonal faces around each vertex. A regular icosahedron is a gyroelongated pentagonal bipyramid and a biaugmented pentagonal antiprism in any of six orientations. 

Industrial archaeology of Dartmoor<====>14971<====>Industrial archaeology of DartmoorThe industrial archaeology of Dartmoor covers a number of the industries which have, over the ages, taken place on Dartmoor, and the remaining evidence surrounding them.  Currently only three industries are economically significant, yet all three will inevitably leave their own traces on the moor: china clay mining, farming and tourism. A good general guide to the commercial activities on Dartmoor at the end of the 19th century is William Crossing's The Dartmoor Worker. Mining In former times, lead, silver, tin and copper were mined extensively on Dartmoor.  The most obvious evidence of mining to the casual visitor to Dartmoor are the remains of the old engine-house at Wheal Betsy which is alongside the A386 road between Tavistock and Okehampton. 

Idempotence<====>14972<====>Idempotence  Idempotence (UK:  ;  US:    )  is the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science that they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.  The concept of idempotence arises in a number of places in abstract algebra (in particular, in the theory of projectors and closure operators) and functional programming (in which it is connected to the property of referential transparency). The term was introduced by Benjamin Peirce  in the context of elements of algebras that remain invariant when raised to a positive integer power, and literally means "(the quality of having) the same power", from   +   (same + power). 

Ithaca, New York<====>14973<====>Ithaca, New York   Ithaca   is a city in the Southern Tier-Finger Lakes region of New York.  It is the seat of Tompkins County, as well as the largest community in the Ithaca-Tompkins County metropolitan area.  This area contains the municipalities of the Town of Ithaca, the village of Cayuga Heights, and other towns and villages in Tompkins County.  The city of Ithaca is located on the southern shore of Cayuga Lake, in Central New York.  It is named for the Greek island of Ithaca.  Ithaca is home to Cornell University, an Ivy League school of over 20,000 students, most of whom study at its local campus. 

Ivy League<====>14975<====>Ivy League   The Ivy League is a collegiate athletic conference comprising sports teams from eight private universities in the Northeastern United States.  The conference name is also commonly used to refer to those eight schools as a group beyond the sports context.   The eight members are Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Yale University.  The term Ivy League has connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism. While the term was in use as early as 1933, it became official only after the formation of the NCAA Division I athletic conference in 1954. 

Ithaca Hours<====>14976<====>Ithaca Hours The Ithaca HOUR is a local currency used in Ithaca, New York and is the oldest and largest local currency system in the United States that is still operating.It has inspired other similar systems in Madison, Wisconsin; Corvallis, Oregon;    and a proposed system in the Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania. One Ithaca HOUR is valued at US$10 and is generally recommended to be used as payment for one hour's work, although the rate is negotiable. The currencyIthaca HOURS are not backed by national currency and cannot be freely converted to national currency, although some businesses may agree to buy them. 

Interstellar cloud<====>14979<====>Interstellar cloudAn interstellar cloud is the generic name given to an accumulation of gas, plasma, and dust in our and other galaxies.   Put differently, an interstellar cloud is a denser-than-average region of the interstellar medium.   Depending on the density, size, and temperature of a given cloud, the hydrogen in it can be neutral (H I regions), ionized (H II regions) (i. e.  a plasma), or molecular (molecular clouds).   Neutral and ionized clouds are sometimes also called diffuse clouds, while molecular clouds are sometimes also referred to as dense clouds. Chemical compositionsAnalyzing the composition of interstellar clouds is achieved by studying electromagnetic radiation that we receive from them. 

Imhotep<====>14980<====>Imhotep   Imhotep ( ;    Egyptian: ỉỉ-m-ḥtp *jā-im-ḥātap, in Unicode hieroglyphs: 𓇍𓅓𓊵:𓏏*𓊪, "the one who comes in peace"; fl.  late 27th century BC) was an Egyptian chancellor to the pharaoh Djoser, probable architect of the step pyramid, and high priest of the sun god Ra at Heliopolis.  Very little is known of Imhotep as a historical figure, but in the 3000 years following his death, he was gradually glorified and deified. Today, outside the egyptological community, he is referred to as a polymath,  poet, Musso, C.  G.  (2005).  Imhotep: The Dean among the Ancient Egyptian Physicians  judge,  engineer, Pickett, A. 

Ictinus<====>14981<====>IctinusIctinus ( ;  , Iktinos) was an architect active in the mid 5th century BC.    Ancient sources identify Ictinus and Callicrates as co-architects of the Parthenon. Pausanias identifies Ictinus as architect of the Temple of Apollo at Bassae.  That temple was Doric on the exterior, Ionic on the interior, and incorporated a Corinthian column, the earliest known, at the center rear of the cella.  Sources also identify Ictinus as architect of the Telesterion at Eleusis, a gigantic hall used in the Eleusinian Mysteries. The artist Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres painted a scene showing Ictinus together with the lyric poet Pindar. 

Isidore of Miletus<====>14982<====>Isidore of MiletusIsidore of Miletus ( ;  Medieval Greek pronunciation:   ;  ) was one of the two main Byzantine Greek architects (Anthemius of Tralles was the other) that Emperor Justinian I commissioned to design the cathedral Hagia Sophia in Constantinople from 532-537.  The creation of a important compilation of Archimedes' works has been attributed to him.   The spurious Book XV from Euclid's Elements has been partly attributed to Isidore of Miletus.    BiographyIsidore of Miletus was a renowned scientist and mathematician before Emperor Justinian I hired him.  Isidorus taught stereometry and physics at the universities, first of Alexandria then of Constantinople, and wrote a commentary on an older treatise on vaulting. 

International Atomic Energy Agency<====>14984<====>International Atomic Energy Agency    The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an international organization that seeks to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and to inhibit its use for any military purpose, including nuclear weapons.  The IAEA was established as an autonomous organisation on 29 July 1957.  Though established independently of the United Nations through its own international treaty, the IAEA Statute,    the IAEA reports to both the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council. The IAEA has its headquarters in Vienna.  The IAEA has two "Regional Safeguards Offices" which are located in Toronto, Canada, and in Tokyo, Japan. 

International Civil Aviation Organization<====>14985<====>International Civil Aviation Organization  The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO; pronounced  ;  , OACI), is a specialized agency of the United Nations.  It codifies the principles and techniques of international air navigation and fosters the planning and development of international air transport to ensure safe and orderly growth.Its headquarters are located in the Quartier International of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The ICAO Council adopts standards and recommended practices concerning air navigation, its infrastructure, flight inspection, prevention of unlawful interference, and facilitation of border-crossing procedures for international civil aviation.  ICAO defines the protocols for air accident investigation followed by transport safety authorities in countries signatory to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation. 

International Maritime Organization<====>14986<====>International Maritime Organization    The International Maritime Organization (IMO), known as the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO) until 1982,    is a specialised agency of the United Nations responsible for regulating shipping.   The IMO was established in Geneva in 1948  and came into force ten years later, meeting for the first time in 1959.   Headquartered in London, United Kingdom, the IMO has 172 Member States and three Associate Members.  The IMO's primary purpose is to develop and maintain a comprehensive regulatory framework for shipping and its remit today includes safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation, maritime security and the efficiency of shipping. 

International Labour Organization<====>14987<====>International Labour OrganizationThe International Labour Organization (ILO) is a United Nations agency dealing with labour problems, particularly international labour standards, social protection, and work opportunities for all.   The ILO has 187 member states: 186 of the 193 UN member states plus the Cook Islands are members of the ILO. In 1969, the organisation received the Nobel Peace Prize for improving peace among classes, pursuing decent work and justice for workers, and providing technical assistance to other developing nations.    The ILO registers complaints against entities that are violating international rules; however, it does not impose sanctions on governments. 

International English<====>14996<====>International EnglishInternational English is the concept of the English language as a global means of communication in numerous dialects, and also the movement towards an international standard for the language.   It is also referred to as Global English, World English, Common English, Continental English, General English, Engas (English as associate language), or Globish.   Sometimes, these terms refer simply to the array of varieties of English spoken throughout the world. Sometimes, "international English" and the related terms above refer to a desired standardisation, i. e.  Standard English; however, there is no consensus on the path to this goal. 

International African Institute<====>14997<====>International African Institute The International African Institute (IAI) was founded (as the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures - IIALC) in 1926 in London for the study of African languages.  Frederick Lugard was the first chairman (1926 to his death in 1945); Diedrich Hermann Westermann (1926 to 1939) and Maurice Delafosse (1926) were the initial co-directors.  Since 1928, the IAI has published a quarterly journal, Africa. The IAI's mission is "to promote the education of the public in the study of Africa and its languages and cultures".  Its operations includes seminars, journals, monographs, edited volumes and stimulating scholarship within Africa. 

Insulin-like growth factor<====>15000<====>Insulin-like growth factorThe insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are proteins with high sequence similarity to insulin.  IGFs are part of a complex system that cells use to communicate with their physiologic environment.  This complex system (often referred to as the IGF "axis") consists of two cell-surface receptors (IGF1R and IGF2R), two ligands (Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2)), a family of six high-affinity IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP-1 to IGFBP-6), as well as associated IGFBP degrading enzymes, referred to collectively as proteases. IGF1/GH AxisThe IGF "axis" is also commonly referred to as the Growth Hormone/IGF-1 Axis. 

Idiot<====>15004<====>Idiot  An idiot, dolt, dullard or (archaically) mome is a person perceived to be lacking intelligence, or someone who acts in a self-defeating or significantly counterproductive way.  Along with the similar terms moron, imbecile, and cretin, the word archaically referred to the intellectually disabled, but have all since gained specialized meanings in modern times.  An idiot is said to be idiotic, and to suffer from idiocy. EtymologyIdiot is a word derived from the Greek  , idiōtēs ("person lacking professional skill", "a private citizen", "individual"), from  , idios ("private", "one's own").    In ancient Greece, people who were not capable of engaging in the public sphere were considered "idiotes", in contrast to the public citizen, or "polites" . 

Islamism<====>15012<====>Islamism   Islamism is a concept whose meaning has been debated in both public and academic contexts.The term can refer to diverse forms of social and political activism advocating that public and political life should be guided by Islamic principles,   or more specifically to movements which call for full implementation of sharia.  It is commonly used interchangeably with the terms political Islam or Islamic fundamentalism.  In Western media usage the term tends to refer to groups who aim to establish a sharia-based Islamic state, often with implication of violent tactics and human rights violations, and has acquired connotations of political extremism. 

Instructional theory<====>15014<====>Instructional theory An instructional theory is "a theory that offers explicit guidance on how to better help people learn and develop. " Reigeluth, C. M.  (1999).  What is instructional design theory? In C. M.  Reigeluth (Ed. ) Instructional design theories and models: A new paradigm of instructional theory (Vol.  2, pp.  5-29).  Manwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.   Instructional theories focus on how to structure material for promoting the education of human beings, particularly youth.  Originating in the United States in the late 1970s, instructional theory is influenced by three basic theories in educational thought: behaviorism, the theory that helps us understand how people conform to predetermined standards; cognitivism, the theory that learning occurs through mental associations; and constructivism, the theory explores the value of human activity as a critical function of gaining knowledge. 

Infusoria<====>15018<====>InfusoriaInfusoria is a collective term for minute aquatic creatures such as ciliates, euglenoids, protozoa, unicellular algae and small invertebrates that exist in freshwater ponds.  Some authors (e. g. , Bütschli) used the term as a synonym for Ciliophora.  In modern formal classifications, the term is considered obsolete; the microorganisms previously included in the Infusoria are mostly assigned to the kingdom Protista.  Researchers have proposed that infusoria reproductive rates periodically increase and decrease over periods of time.  Aquarium useInfusoria are used by owners of aquariums to feed fish fry; newly hatched fry of many common aquarium species can be successfully raised on this food during early development due to its size and nutritional content. 

ISO/IEC 8859-1<====>15019<====>ISO/IEC 8859-1  ISO/IEC 8859-1:1998, Information technology — 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets — Part 1: Latin alphabet No.  1, is part of the ISO/IEC 8859 series of ASCII-based standard character encodings, first edition published in 1987.  ISO 8859-1 encodes what it refers to as "Latin alphabet no.  1," consisting of 191 characters from the Latin script.  This character-encoding scheme is used throughout the Americas, Western Europe, Oceania, and much of Africa.  It is also commonly used in most standard romanizations of East-Asian languages.  It is the basis for most popular 8-bit character sets, including Windows-1252 and the first block of characters in Unicode. 

ISO/IEC 8859<====>15020<====>ISO/IEC 8859  ISO/IEC 8859 is a joint ISO and IEC series of standards for 8-bit character encodings.  The series of standards consists of numbered parts, such as ISO/IEC 8859-1, ISO/IEC 8859-2, etc.  There are 15 parts, excluding the abandoned ISO/IEC 8859-12.  The ISO working group maintaining this series of standards has been disbanded. ISO/IEC 8859 parts 1, 2, 3, and 4 were originally Ecma International standard ECMA-94. IntroductionWhile the bit patterns of the 95 printable ASCII characters are sufficient to exchange information in modern English, most other languages that use Latin alphabets need additional symbols not covered by ASCII. 

Infrared<====>15022<====>Infrared  Infrared radiation is electromagnetic radiation (EMR) with longer wavelengths than those of visible light, and is therefore invisible to the human eye.  It is sometimes  called infrared light.  It extends from the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum at 700 nanometers (frequency 430 THz), to 1 millimeter (300 GHz)  (although specially pulsed lasers can allow humans to detect IR radiation up to 1050 nm.   ).   Most of the thermal radiation emitted by objects near room temperature is infrared.   Like all EMR, IR carries radiant energy, and behaves both like a wave and like its quantum particle, the photon. 

Icosidodecahedron<====>15023<====>Icosidodecahedron In geometry, an icosidodecahedron is a polyhedron with twenty triangular faces and twelve pentagonal faces.  An icosidodecahedron has 30 identical vertices, with two triangles and two pentagons meeting at each, and 60 identical edges, each separating a triangle from a pentagon.  As such it is one of the Archimedean solids and more particularly, a quasiregular polyhedron. GeometryAn icosidodecahedron has icosahedral symmetry, and its first stellation is the compound of a dodecahedron and its dual icosahedron, with the vertices of the icosidodecahedron located at the midpoints of the edges of either. Its dual polyhedron is the rhombic triacontahedron. 

ISO 8601<====>15024<====>ISO 8601ISO 8601 Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange – Representation of dates and times is an international standard covering the exchange of date- and time-related data.  It was issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was first published in 1988.  The purpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined method of representing dates and times, so as to avoid misinterpretation of numeric representations of dates and times, particularly when data are transferred between countries with different conventions for writing numeric dates and times. In general, ISO 8601 applies to representations and formats of dates in the Gregorian (and potentially proleptic Gregorian) calendar, times based on the 24-hour timekeeping system (including optional time zone information), time intervals and combinations thereof. 

International Seabed Authority<====>15028<====>International Seabed Authority  The International Seabed Authority (ISA) ( ,  ) is an intergovernmental body based in Kingston, Jamaica, that was established to organize, regulate and control all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, an area underlying most of the world’s oceans.  It is an organization established by the Law of the Sea Convention.  Chronological lists of ratifications of, accessions and successions to the Convention and the related Agreements.  UN: regularly updated.  OriginFollowing at least ten preparatory meetings over the years,    the Authority held its first inaugural meeting in its host country, Jamaica, on 16 November 1994,  the day the Convention came into force. 

Industry Standard Architecture<====>15029<====>Industry Standard Architecture   Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) is a retronym term for the 16-bit internal bus of IBM PC/AT and similar computers based on the Intel 80286 and its immediate successors during the 1980s.  The bus was (largely) backward compatible with the 8-bit bus of the 8088-based IBM PC, including the IBM PC/XT as well as IBM PC compatibles. Originally referred to as the PC/AT-bus it was also termed I/O Channel by IBM.  The ISA concept was coined by competing PC-clone manufacturers in the late 1980s or early 1990s as a reaction to IBM attempts to replace the AT-bus with its new and incompatible Micro Channel architecture. 

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change<====>15030<====>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change    The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a scientific and intergovernmental body under the auspices of the United Nations,  set up at the request of member governments, dedicated to the task of providing the world with an objective, scientific view of climate change and its political and economic impacts.It was first established in 1988 by two United Nations organizations, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and later endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly through Resolution 43/53. 

IBM Personal Computer<====>15032<====>IBM Personal Computer  The IBM Personal Computer, commonly known as the IBM PC, is the original version and progenitor of the IBM PC compatible hardware platform.  It is IBM model number 5150, and was introduced on August 12, 1981.  It was created by a team of engineers and designers under the direction of Don Estridge of the IBM Entry Systems Division in Boca Raton, Florida. The generic term personal computer was in use before 1981, applied as early as 1972 to the Xerox PARC's Alto, but because of the success of the IBM Personal Computer, the term "PC" came to mean more specifically a desktop microcomputer compatible with IBM's Personal Computer branded products. 

Counties of Ireland<====>15033<====>Counties of Ireland   The counties of Ireland ( ; Ulster-Scots: coonties o Airlann) are sub-national divisions that have been, and in some cases continue to be, used to geographically demarcate areas of local government.  These land divisions were formed following the Norman invasion of Ireland in imitation of the counties then in use as units of local government in the Kingdom of England.   The older term "shire" was historically equivalent to "county".  The principal function of the county was to impose royal control in the areas of taxation, security and the administration of justice at the local level. 

Information Sciences Institute<====>15034<====>Information Sciences InstituteThe USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI) is a component of the University of Southern California (USC) Viterbi School of Engineering, and specializes in research and development in information processing, computing, and communications technologies.

Information security<====>15036<====>Information security  Information security, sometimes shortened to InfoSec, is the practice of preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction of information.  It is a general term that can be used regardless of the form the data may take (e. g.  electronic, physical).   The chief area of concern for the field of information security is the balanced protection of the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of data, also known as the CIA Triad, while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation and no major hampering of organization productivity.   To standardize this discipline, academics and professionals collaborate and seek to set basic guidelines and policies on password, antivirus software, firewall, encryption software, legal liability and user/administrator training standards. 

Income<====>15037<====>Income  Income is the consumption and savings opportunity gained by an entity within a specified timeframe, which is generally expressed in monetary terms.  Smith's financial dictionary.  Smith, Howard Irving.  1908.  Income is defined as, "Revenue; the amount of money coming to a person or a corporation (usually interpreted as meaning annually) whether as payment for services or as interest or other profit from investment. "   Barr, N.  (2004).  Problems and definition of measurement.  In Economics of the welfare state.  New York: Oxford University Press.  pp.  121-124  However, for households and individuals, "income is the sum of all the wages, salaries, profits, interests payments, rents, and other forms of earnings received. 

Iona<====>15039<====>Iona   Iona ( ) is a small island in the Inner Hebrides off the Ross of Mull on the western coast of Scotland.  It is mainly known for Iona Abbey, however there are other buildings on the island.  Iona Abbey was a centre of Gaelic monasticism for three centuries  and is today known for its relative tranquility and natural environment.   It is a tourist destination and a place for spiritual retreats.  Its modern Gaelic name means "Iona of (Saint) Columba" (formerly anglicised "Icolmkill"). EtymologyThe Hebrides have been occupied by the speakers of several languages since the Iron Age, and as a result many of the names of these islands have more than one possible meaning. 

Ido language<====>15040<====>Ido language  Ido   is a constructed language, derived from Reformed Esperanto, created to be a universal second language for speakers of diverse backgrounds.  Ido was specifically designed to be grammatically, orthographically, and lexicographically regular, and above all easy to learn and use.  In this sense, Ido is classified as a constructed international auxiliary language.  It is the most successful of many Esperanto derivatives, called Esperantidos. Ido was created in 1907 out of a desire to reform perceived flaws in Esperanto, a language that had been created 20 years earlier to facilitate international communication.  The name of the language traces its origin to the Esperanto word  , meaning "offspring",  since the language is a "descendant" of Esperanto. 

Improvisational theatre<====>15041<====>Improvisational theatreImprovisational theatre, often called improv  or impro, is the form of theatre, often comedy, in which most or all of what is performed is unplanned or unscripted: created spontaneously by the performers.  In its purest form, the dialogue, action, story, and characters are created collaboratively by the players as the improvisation unfolds in present time, without use of an already prepared, written script. Improvisational theatre exists in performance as a range of styles of improvisational comedy as well as some non-comedic theatrical performances.  It is sometimes used in film and television, both to develop characters and scripts and occasionally as part of the final product. 

International Space Station<====>15043<====>International Space StationThe International Space Station (ISS) is a space station, or a habitable artificial satellite, in low Earth orbit.  Its first component launched into orbit in 1998, the last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and the station is expected to be used until 2028.  Development and assembly of the station continues, with components scheduled for launch in 2018 and 2019.  The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth.    The ISS consists of pressurised modules, external trusses, solar arrays, and other components. 

Cosmicomics<====>15045<====>Cosmicomics   Cosmicomics ( ) is a collection of twelve short stories by Italo Calvino first published in Italian in 1965 and in English in 1968.  The stories were originally published between 1964 and 1965 in the Italian periodicals Il Caffè and Il Giorno.  Each story takes a scientific "fact" (though sometimes a falsehood by today's understanding), and builds an imaginative story around it.   An always extant being called Qfwfq narrates all of the stories save two, each of which is a memory of an event in the history of the universe.  Qfwfq also narrates some stories in Calvino's t zero. 

IA-32<====>15046<====>IA-32  IA-32 (short for "Intel Architecture, 32-bit", sometimes also called i386  )  is the 32-bit version of the x86 instruction set architecture, first implemented in the Intel 80386 microprocessors in 1985.   IA-32 is the first incarnation of x86 that supports 32-bit computing;  as a result, the "IA-32" term may be used as a metonym to refer to all x86 versions that support 32-bit computing.   The IA-32 instruction set was introduced in the Intel 80386 microprocessor in 1985 and,  , remains supported by contemporary PC microprocessors.  Even though the instruction set has remained intact, the successive generations of microprocessors that run it have become much faster. 

Internalism and externalism<====>15047<====>Internalism and externalismInternalism and externalism are two opposing ways of explaining various subjects in several areas of philosophy.  These include human motivation, knowledge, justification, meaning, and truth.  The distinction arises in many areas of debate with similar but distinct meanings. Internalism is the thesis that no fact about the world can provide reasons for action independently of desires and beliefs.  Giuseppina D'Oro, "Collingwood, psychologism and internalism," European Journal of Philosophy 12(2):163–177 (2004).   Externalism is the thesis that reasons are to be identified with objective features of the world.  Moral philosophyMotivationIn contemporary moral philosophy, motivational internalism (or moral internalism) is the view that moral convictions (which are not necessarily beliefs, e. 

Isolationism<====>15048<====>IsolationismIsolationism is a category of foreign policies institutionalized by leaders who asserted that their nations' best interests were best served by keeping the affairs of other countries at a distance.  One possible motivation for limiting international involvement is to avoid being drawn into dangerous and otherwise undesirable conflicts.  There may also be a perceived benefit from avoiding international trade agreements or other mutual assistance pacts.  IntroductionIsolationism has been defined as: Isolationism by countryAlbaniaBhutanBefore 1999, Bhutan had banned television and the Internet in order to preserve its culture, environment, identity etc.   Eventually, Jigme Singye Wangchuck lifted the ban on television and the Internet. 

Indianapolis Colts<====>15049<====>Indianapolis Colts   The Indianapolis Colts are an American football team based in Indianapolis, Indiana.  The Colts compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) South division.  Since the 2008 season, the Colts have played their games in Lucas Oil Stadium.  Previously, the team had played for over two decades (1984–2007) at the RCA Dome.  Since 1986, the Colts have been the host team for the NFL Scouting Combine. The Colts have been a member club of the NFL since their founding in 1953 in Baltimore. 

Immigration to the United States<====>15051<====>Immigration to the United States    in Virginia, December 2015. ]]Immigration to the United States is the international movement of individuals who are not natives or do not possess citizenship in order to settle, reside, study or to take-up employment in the United States.  It has been a major source of population growth and cultural change throughout much of the history of the United States. The United States has a larger immigrant population than any other country, with 47 million immigrants as of 2015.    This represents 19. 1% of the 244 million international migrants worldwide, and 14. 

Image and Scanner Interface Specification<====>15052<====>Image and Scanner Interface Specification Image and Scanner Interface Specification (ISIS) is an industry standard interface for image scanning technologies, developed by Pixel Translations in 1990 (which became EMC Corporation's Captiva Software and later acquired by OpenText). ISIS is an open standard for scanner control and a complete image-processing framework.  It is currently supported by a number of application and scanner vendors. FunctionsThe modular design allows the scanner to be accessed both directly or with built-in routines to handle most situations automatically. A message-based interface with tags is used so that features, operations, and formats not yet supported by ISIS can be added as desired without waiting for a new version of the specification. 

Ivo Caprino<====>15053<====>Ivo Caprino   Ivo Caprino (17 February 1920 – 8 February 2001) was a Norwegian film director and writer, best known for his puppet films.  His most famous film is Flåklypa Grand Prix ("Pinchcliffe Grand Prix"), made in 1975. Early career In the mid-1940s, Caprino helped his mother design puppets for a puppet theatre, which inspired him to try making a film using his mother's designs.  The result of their collaboration was Tim og Tøffe, an 8-minute film released in 1949.  Several films followed in the next couple of years, including two 15-minute shorts that are still shown regularly in Norway today, Veslefrikk med Fela (Little Freddy and his Fiddle), based on a Norwegian folk tale, and Karius og Baktus, a story by Thorbjørn Egner of two little trolls, representing Caries and Bacterium, living in a boy's teeth. 

Intel 80286<====>15054<====>Intel 80286 The Intel 80286  (also marketed as the iAPX 286    and often called Intel 286) is a 16-bit microprocessor that was introduced on 1 February 1982.  It was the first 8086 based CPU with separate, non-multiplexed address and data buses and also the first with memory management and wide protection abilities.  The 80286 used approximately 134,000 transistors in its original nMOS (HMOS) incarnation and, just like the contemporary 80186,  it could correctly execute most software written for the earlier Intel 8086 and 8088 processors.  The 80286 was employed for the IBM PC/AT, introduced in 1984, and then widely used in most PC/AT compatible computers until the early 1990s. 

Ivanhoe<====>15055<====>IvanhoeIvanhoe   is a historical novel by Sir Walter Scott, first published in 1820 in three volumes and subtitled A Romance.  At the time it was written it represented a shift by Scott away from fairly realistic novels set in Scotland in the comparatively recent past, to a somewhat fanciful depiction of medieval England.   It has proved to be one of the best known and most influential of Scott's novels. Ivanhoe is set in 12th-century England, with colourful descriptions of a tournament, outlaws, a witch trial and divisions between Jews and Christians. 

Isoelectric point<====>15056<====>Isoelectric pointThe isoelectric point (pI, pH(I), IEP), is the pH at which a particular molecule carries no net electrical charge in the statistical mean.  The standard nomenclature to represent the isoelectric point is pH(I),  although pI is also commonly seen, IUPAC.  Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed.  (the "Gold Book").  Compiled by A.  D.

International reply coupon<====>15058<====>International reply couponAn international reply coupon (IRC) is a coupon that can be exchanged for one or more postage stamps representing the minimum postage for an unregistered priority airmail letter of up to twenty grams sent to another Universal Postal Union (UPU) member country.  IRCs are accepted by all UPU member countries. UPU member postal services are obliged to exchange an IRC for postage, but are not obliged to sell them. The purpose of the IRC is to allow a person to send someone in another country a letter, along with the cost of postage for a reply.  If the addressee is within the same country, there is no need for an IRC because a self-addressed stamped envelope (SASE) or return postcard will suffice; but if the addressee is in another country an IRC removes the necessity of acquiring foreign postage or sending appropriate currency. 

Isaac Bonewits<====>15059<====>Isaac Bonewits  Phillip Emmons Isaac Bonewits (October 1, 1949 – August 12, 2010   ) was an American Druid who published a number of books on the subject of Neopaganism and magic.  He was also a public speaker, liturgist, singer and songwriter, and founded the Druidic organization Ár nDraíocht Féin, as well as the Neopagan civil rights group, the Aquarian Anti-Defamation League.  Born in Royal Oak, Michigan, Bonewits had been heavily involved in occultism since the 1960s. Early life and educationBonewits was born on October 1, 1949 in Royal Oak, Michigan, as the fourth of five children. 

Intel 8080<====>15062<====>Intel 8080   The Intel 8080 ("eighty-eighty") was the second 8-bit microprocessor designed and manufactured by Intel and was released in April 1974.    Electronic News was a weekly trade newspaper.  The same advertisement appeared in the May 2, 1974 issue of Electronics magazine.   It is an extended and enhanced variant of the earlier 8008 design, although without binary compatibility.   The initial specified clock frequency limit was 2 MHz, and with common instructions using 4, 5, 7, 10, or 11 cycles this meant that it operated at a typical speed of a few hundred thousand instructions per second. 

Intel 8086<====>15063<====>Intel 8086 The 8086  (also called iAPX 86 )    is a 16-bit microprocessor chip designed by Intel between early 1976 and mid-1978, when it was released.  The Intel 8088, released in 1979, is a slightly modified chip with an external 8-bit data bus (allowing the use of cheaper and fewer supporting ICs Fewer TTL buffers, latches, multiplexers (although the amount of TTL  logic  was not drastically reduced).  It also permits the use of cheap 8080-family ICs, where the 8254 CTC, 8255 PIO, and 8259 PIC were used in the IBM PC design. 

Intel 8088<====>15064<====>Intel 8088 The Intel 8088 ("eighty-eighty-eight", also called iAPX 88)microprocessor is a variant of the Intel 8086.  Introduced on July 1, 1979, the 8088 had an 8-bit external data bus instead of the 16-bit bus of the 8086.  The 16-bit registers and the one megabyte address range were unchanged, however.  In fact, according to the Intel documentation, the 8086 and 8088 have the same execution unit (EU)—only the bus interface unit (BIU) is different.   The original IBM PC was based on the 8088. History and descriptionThe 8088 was designed in Israel, at Intel's Haifa laboratory, as were a large number of Intel's processors. 

Insulator (electricity)<====>15066<====>Insulator (electricity)  An electrical insulator is a material whose internal electric charges do not flow freely; very little electric current will flow through it under the influence of an electric field.  This contrasts with other materials, semiconductors and conductors, which conduct electric current more easily.  The property that distinguishes an insulator is its resistivity; insulators have higher resistivity than semiconductors or conductors. A perfect insulator does not exist, because even insulators contain small numbers of mobile charges (charge carriers) which can carry current.   In addition, all insulators become electrically conductive when a sufficiently large voltage is applied that the electric field tears electrons away from the atoms. 

Internetworking<====>15067<====>Internetworking  Internetworking is the practice of connecting a computer network with other networks through the use of gateways that provide a common method of routing information packets between the networks.  The resulting system of interconnected networks are called an internetwork, or simply an internet.  Internetworking is a combination of the words inter ("between") and networking; not internet-working or international-network. The most notable example of internetworking is the Internet, a network of networks based on many underlying hardware technologies, but unified by an internetworking protocol standard, the Internet Protocol Suite, often also referred to as TCP/IP. The smallest amount of effort to create an internet (an internetwork, not the Internet), is to have two LANs of computers connected to each other via a router. 

Infantry<====>15068<====>Infantry   Infantry is the branch of an army that engages in military combat on foot, distinguished from cavalry, artillery, and tank forces.  Also known as foot soldiers, infantry traditionally relies on moving by foot between combats as well, but may also use mounts, military vehicles, or other transport.  Infantry make up a large portion of all armed forces in most nations, and typically bear the largest brunt in warfare, as measured by casualties, deprivation, or physical and psychological stress.  The first military forces in history were infantry.  In antiquity, infantry were armed with an early melee weapon such as a spear, axe or sword, or an early ranged weapon like a javelin, sling, or bow, with a few infantrymen having both a melee and a ranged weapon. 

Identity function<====>15069<====>Identity function  In mathematics, an identity function, also called an identity relation or identity map or identity transformation, is a function that always returns the same value that was used as its argument.  In equations, the function is given by  . DefinitionFormally, if   is a set, the identity function   on   is defined to be that function with domain and codomain   which satisfies    for all elements   in  .  In other words, the function value   in   (that is, the codomain) is always the same input element   of   (now considered as the domain). 

Intel 80386<====>15070<====>Intel 80386   The Intel 80386, also known as i386 or just 386, is a 32-bit microprocessor introduced in 1985.   The first versions had 275,000 transistors mit. edu—The Future of FPGAs (Cornell) 2012-10-11  and were the CPU of many workstations and high-end personal computers of the time.  As the original implementation of the 32-bit extension of the 80286 architecture,  the 80386 instruction set, programming model, and binary encodings are still the common denominator for all 32-bit x86 processors, which is termed the i386-architecture, x86, or IA-32, depending on context. The 32-bit 80386 can correctly execute most code intended for the earlier 16-bit processors such as 8086 and 80286 that were ubiquitous in early PCs. 

Instruction register<====>15072<====>Instruction registerIn computing, an instruction register (IR) is the part of a CPU's control unit that holds the instruction currently being executed or decoded.   In simple processors each instruction to be executed is loaded into the instruction register which holds it while it is decoded, prepared and ultimately executed, which can take several steps.  Some of the complicated processors use a pipeline of instruction registers where each stage of the pipeline does part of the decoding, preparation or execution and then passes it to the next stage for its step.   Modern processors can even do some of the steps out of order as decoding on several instructions is done in parallel.

INTERCAL<====>15075<====>INTERCALThe Compiler Language With No Pronounceable Acronym, abbreviated INTERCAL, is an esoteric programming language that was created as a parody by Don Woods and James M.  Lyon, two Princeton University students, in 1972.  It satirizes aspects of the various programming languages at the time,  as well as the proliferation of proposed language constructs and notations in the 1960s. There are two currently maintained versions of INTERCAL: C-INTERCAL, maintained by Eric S.  Raymond,    and CLC-INTERCAL, maintained by Claudio Calvelli.    HistoryAccording to the original manual by the authors,    The original Princeton implementation used punched cards and the EBCDIC character set. 

International Data Encryption Algorithm<====>15076<====>International Data Encryption Algorithm In cryptography, the International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), originally called Improved Proposed Encryption Standard (IPES), is a symmetric-key block cipher designed by James Massey of ETH Zurich and Xuejia Lai and was first described in 1991.   The algorithm was intended as a replacement for the Data Encryption Standard (DES).  IDEA is a minor revision of an earlier cipher Proposed Encryption Standard (PES). The cipher was designed under a research contract with the Hasler Foundation, which became part of Ascom-Tech AG.  The cipher was patented in a number of countries but was freely available for non-commercial use. 

Indoor rower<====>15077<====>Indoor rower An indoor rower, or rowing machine, is a machine used to simulate the action of watercraft rowing for the purpose of exercise or training for rowing.  Indoor rowing has become established as a sport in its own right.  The term also refers to a participant in this sport. Modern indoor rowers are often known as ergometers (colloquially erg or ergo), an ergometer being a device which measures the amount of work performed.  The indoor rower is calibrated to measure the amount of energy the rower is using through their use of the equipment. History Chabrias, an Athenian admiral of the 4th century BC, introduced the first rowing machines as supplemental military training devices. 

Internetwork Packet Exchange<====>15078<====>Internetwork Packet Exchange  Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) is the network layer protocol in the IPX/SPX protocol suite.  IPX is derived from Xerox Network Systems' IDP.  It may act as a transport layer protocol as well. The IPX/SPX protocol suite was very popular through the late 1980s into the mid-1990s because it was used by the Novell NetWare network operating system.  Because of Novell Netware popularity the IPX became a prominent internetworking protocol. A big advantage of IPX was a small memory footprint of the IPX driver, which was vital for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows up to the version Windows 95 because of limited size of the conventional memory. 

International human rights instruments<====>15079<====>International human rights instruments International human rights instruments are treaties and other international documents relevant to international human rights law and the protection of human rights in general.   They can be classified into two categories: declarations, adopted by bodies such as the United Nations General Assembly, which are not legally binding although they may be politically so as soft law;  and conventions, which are legally binding instruments concluded under international law.  International treaties and even declarations can, over time, obtain the status of customary international law. International human rights instruments can be divided further into global instruments, to which any state in the world can be a party, and regional instruments, which are restricted to states in a particular region of the world. 

Indian removal<====>15080<====>Indian removal Indian removal was a policy of the United States government in the 19th century whereby Native Americans were forcibly removed from their ancestral homelands in the eastern United States to lands west of the Mississippi River, thereafter known as Indian Territory.  In a matter that remains one of debate by scholars, description of the policy—which clearly contributed to devastation in numbers, freedom and prosperity for those displaced—is sometimes elevated to being one of long-term genocide of Native Americans.    Also available in reprint from the History News Network. In any case, Indian removal was a consequence of actions first by European settlers to North America in the colonial period, then by the United States government and its citizens until the mid-20th century. 

Green Party (Ireland)<====>15081<====>Green Party (Ireland)   The Green Party ( , literally "Green Alliance") is a green political party that operates in Ireland—both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It was founded as the Ecology Party of Ireland in 1981 by Dublin teacher Christopher Fettes.  The party became the Green Alliance in 1983; this name was changed in 1987 to its current title in English, while the Irish name was kept unchanged.  Its leader is Eamon Ryan, its deputy leader is Catherine Martin and its chairman is Roderic O'Gorman.  Green Party candidates have been elected to most levels of representation: local (in the Republic), Dáil Éireann, Northern Ireland Assembly and European Parliament. 

Iconoclasm<====>15085<====>Iconoclasm Iconoclasm Literally, "image-breaking", from  .  Iconoclasm may be also considered as a back-formation from iconoclast (from Greek εἰκοκλάστης).  The corresponding Greek word for iconoclasm is εἰκονοκλασία – eikonoklasia.   is the social belief in the importance of the destruction of icons and other images or monuments, most frequently for religious or political reasons.  Over time, the word, usually in the adjectival form,  has also come to refer to aggressive statements or actions against any well-established status quo.  It is a frequent component of major political or religious changes.  The term does not generally encompass the specific destruction of images of a ruler after his death or overthrow (damnatio memoriae). 

Imbolc<====>15087<====>Imbolc   Imbolc or Imbolg (   ), also called (Saint) Brigid's Day ( ,  ,  ), is a Gaelic traditional festival marking the beginning of spring.  Most commonly it is held on 1 February, or  about halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox.  Danaher, Kevin (1972) The Year in Ireland: Irish Calendar Customs Dublin, Mercier.    pp.  38  McNeill, F.  Marian (1959, 1961) The Silver Bough, Vol.  1–4.  William MacLellan, Glasgow; Vol.  2, pp.  11–42  Historically, it was widely observed throughout Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man. 

Isaiah<====>15088<====>Isaiah   Isaiah (  or  ;    ;   ˀēšaˁyā; Greek:  , Ēsaïās; Latin: Isaias; Arabic: إشعيا Ašaʿyāʾ or šaʿyā;  "Yah is salvation" ) was the 8th-century BCE Jewish prophet for whom the Book of Isaiah is named.   Within the text of the Book of Isaiah, Isaiah himself is referred to as "the prophet",  but the exact relationship between the Book of Isaiah and any such historical Isaiah is complicated.  The traditional view is that all 66 chapters of the book of Isaiah were written by one man, Isaiah, possibly in two periods between 740 BCE and c. 

Interpreted language<====>15089<====>Interpreted language    An interpreted language is a type of programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.  The interpreter executes the program directly, translating each statement into a sequence of one or more subroutines already compiled into machine code. The terms interpreted language and compiled language are not well defined because, in theory, any programming language can be either interpreted or compiled.  In modern programming language implementation it is increasingly popular for a platform to provide both options. Interpreted languages can also be contrasted with machine languages. 

Intifada<====>15095<====>Intifada  Intifada (   ) is an Arabic word literally meaning, as a noun, "tremor", "shivering", "shuddering".  Mary K. Roberson, 'Birth, Transformation, and Death of Refugee Identity: Women and Girls of the Intifada,' in Ellen Cole,Esther D Rothblum,Oliva M Espin (eds. ) Refugee Women and Their Mental Health: Shattered Societies, Shattered Lives, Routledge,  2013 p. 42.    It is derived from an Arabic term nafada meaning "to shake", "shake off", "get rid of",  as a dog might shrug off water, or as one might shake off sleep,  or dirt from one's sandals,  and is a key concept in contemporary Arabic usage referring to a legitimate uprising against oppression. 

Ionosphere<====>15097<====>IonosphereThe ionosphere (   ) is the ionized part of Earth's upper atmosphere, from about   to   altitude, a region that includes the thermosphere and parts of the  mesosphere and exosphere.  The ionosphere is ionized by solar radiation.  It plays an important role in atmospheric electricity and forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere.  It has practical importance because, among other functions, it influences radio propagation to distant places on the Earth.  K.  Rawer.  Wave Propagation in the Ionosphere.  Kluwer Acad. Publ. , Dordrecht 1993.    HistoryAs early as 1839, the German mathematician and physicist Carl Friedrich Gauss postulated that an electrically conducting region of the atmosphere could account for observed variations of Earth's magnetic field. 

Ido (language)<====>15099<====>Ido (language)

Interlingua<====>15100<====>Interlingua    Interlingua ( ; ISO 639 language codes ia, ina) is an Italic international auxiliary language (IAL), developed between 1937 and 1951 by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA).  It ranks among the top most widely used IALs (along with Esperanto and Ido), and is the most widely used naturalistic IAL:    in other words, its vocabulary, grammar and other characteristics are derived from natural languages rather than a centrally planned grammar and vocabulary.  Interlingua was developed to combine a simple, mostly regular grammar   with a vocabulary common to the widest possible range of western European languages, Gode, Alexander, "Introduction", Interlingua-English: A dictionary of the international language, Revised Edition, New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, 1971. 

Isle of Wight<====>15102<====>Isle of Wight    The Isle of Wight ( ; also referred to informally as IoW    or The Island) is a county and the largest and second-most populous island in England.  It is in the English Channel, about 2 miles (3. 2 km) off the coast of Hampshire, separated by the Solent.  The island has resorts that have been holiday destinations since Victorian times, and is known for its mild climate, coastal scenery, and verdant landscape of fields, downland and chines.  The island has been home to the poets Swinburne and Tennyson and to Queen Victoria, who built her much-loved summer residence and final home Osborne House at East Cowes. 

Internet Control Message Protocol<====>15107<====>Internet Control Message Protocol The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a supporting protocol in the Internet protocol suite.  It is used by network devices, including routers, to send error messages and operational information indicating, for example, that a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached.ICMP differs from transport protocols such as TCP and UDP in that it is not typically used to exchange data between systems, nor is it regularly employed by end-user network applications (with the exception of some diagnostic tools like ping and traceroute). 

Inverse limit<====>15109<====>Inverse limitIn mathematics, the inverse limit (also called the projective limit or limit) is a construction that allows one to "glue together" several related objects, the precise manner of the gluing process being specified by morphisms between the objects.  Inverse limits can be defined in any category. Formal definitionAlgebraic objectsWe start with the definition of an inverse system (or projective system) of groups and homomorphisms.  Let (I, ≤) be a directed poset (not all authors require I to be directed).  Let (A i ) i∈I  be a family of groups and suppose we have a family of homomorphisms f ij : A j  → A i  for all i ≤ j (note the order), called bonding maps, with the following properties:f ii  is the identity on A i ,f ik  = f ij   o  f jk  for all i ≤ j ≤ k. 

Interplanetary spaceflight<====>15111<====>Interplanetary spaceflight  Interplanetary spaceflight or interplanetary travel is travel between planets, usually within a single planetary system.   In practice, spaceflights of this type are confined to travel between the planets of the Solar System. Current achievements in interplanetary travelRemotely guided space probes have flown by all of the planets of the Solar System from Mercury to Neptune, with the New Horizons probe having flown by the dwarf planet Pluto and the Dawn spacecraft currently orbiting the dwarf planet Ceres.  The most distant spacecraft, Voyager 1, has left the Solar System, while Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 2 and New Horizons are on course to leave it. 

Interference (wave propagation)<====>15112<====>Interference (wave propagation)  In physics, interference is a phenomenon in which two waves superpose to form a resultant wave of greater, lower, or the same amplitude.  Interference usually refers to the interaction of waves that are correlated or coherent with each other, either because they come from the same source or because they have the same or nearly the same frequency.  Interference effects can be observed with all types of waves, for example, light, radio, acoustic, surface water waves or matter waves. MechanismsThe principle of superposition of waves states that when two or more propagating waves of same type are incident on the same point, the resultant amplitude at that point is equal to the vector sum of the amplitudes of the individual waves. 

Indictable offence<====>15114<====>Indictable offence In many common law jurisdictions (e. g. , England and Wales, Ireland, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore), an indictable offence is an offence which can only be tried on an indictment after a preliminary hearing to determine whether there is a prima facie case to answer or by a grand jury (in contrast to a summary offence).  In the United States, a crime of similar severity and rules is called a felony, which also requires an indictment. England and WalesIn relation to England and Wales, the expression indictable offence means an offence which, if committed by an adult, is triable on indictment, whether it is exclusively so triable or triable either way; and the term indictable, in its application to offences, is to be construed accordingly. 

Inter Milan<====>15116<====>Inter Milan  Football Club Internazionale Milano S. p. A. , commonly referred to as Internazionale ( ) or simply Inter and colloquially known as Inter Milan outside Italy,   is a professional Italian football club based in Milan, Lombardy.  The club has played continuously in the top tier of the Italian football league system since its debut in 1909. Inter has won 30 domestic trophies on par with its local rivals A. C.  Milan, including 18 league titles, 7 Coppa Italia and 5 Supercoppa Italiana.  From 2006 to 2010, the club won five successive league titles, equalling the all-time record at that time. 

Interferon<====>15120<====>Interferon  Interferons (IFNs) are a group of signaling proteins  made and released by host cells in response to the presence of several pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, and also tumor cells.  In a typical scenario, a virus-infected cell will release interferons causing nearby cells to heighten their anti-viral defenses. IFNs belong to the large class of proteins known as cytokines, molecules used for communication between cells to trigger the protective defenses of the immune system that help eradicate pathogens.Interferons are named for  their ability to "interfere" with viral replication  by protecting cells from virus infections. 

Israeli settlement<====>15123<====>Israeli settlement    Israeli settlements are civilian communities  inhabited by Israeli citizens, almost exclusively of Jewish ethnicity,   built predominantly on lands within the Palestinian territories, which Israel has militarily occupied since the 1967 Six-Day War,  and partly on lands considered Syrian territory also militarily occupied by Israel since the 1967 war.  Such settlements within Palestinian territories currently exist in Area C of the West Bank and in East Jerusalem, and within Syrian territory in the Golan Heights. Following the 1967 war, Israeli settlements also existed within Egyptian territory in the Sinai Peninsula, and within the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip; however, Israel evacuated the Sinai settlements following the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace agreement and from the Gaza Strip in 2005 under Israel's unilateral disengagement plan. 

Irrealism (the arts)<====>15125<====>Irrealism (the arts)Irrealism is a term that has been used by various writers in the fields of philosophy, literature, and art to denote specific modes of unreality and/or the problems in concretely defining reality.   While in philosophy the term specifically refers to a position put forward by the American philosopher Nelson Goodman, in literature and art it refers to a variety of writers and movements.   If the term has nonetheless retained a certain consistency in its use across these fields and would-be movements, it perhaps reflects the word’s position in general English usage: though the standard dictionary definition of irreal gives it the same meaning as unreal, irreal is very rarely used in comparison with unreal. 

You have two cows<====>15129<====>You have two cows "You have two cows" refers to a form of political satire involving variations of a scenario, where what occurs to the eponymous cows is used to demonstrate how certain political systems function. HistoryJokes of this type attracted the attention of a scholar in the USA as early as 1944.  An article in The Modern Language Journal lists the following classical ones: Socialism: You have two cows.  The government takes one and gives it to your neighbour. Communism: You have two cows.  You give them to the government, and the government then gives you some milk. 

Lightbulb joke<====>15134<====>Lightbulb jokeA lightbulb joke is a joke that asks how many people of a certain group are needed to change, replace, or screw in a light bulb.  Generally, the punch line answer highlights a stereotype of the target group.  There are numerous versions of the lightbulb joke satirizing a wide range of cultures, beliefs and occupations.   Early versions of the joke, popular in the late 1960s   and the 1970s, were used to insult the intelligence of people, especially Poles ("Polish jokes").    For instance: Although lightbulb jokes tend to be derogatory in tone (e.

International Electrotechnical Commission<====>15144<====>International Electrotechnical Commission   The International Electrotechnical Commission  (IEC; in French: Commission électrotechnique internationale) is an international standards organization   that prepares and publishes International Standards for all electrical, electronic and related technologies – collectively known as "electrotechnology".  IEC standards cover a vast range of technologies from power generation, transmission and distribution to home appliances and office equipment, semiconductors, fibre optics, batteries, solar energy, nanotechnology and marine energy as well as many others.  The IEC also manages three global conformity assessment systems that certify whether equipment, system or components conform to its International Standards. The IEC charter embraces all electrotechnologies including energy production and distribution, electronics, magnetics and electromagnetics, electroacoustics, multimedia, telecommunication and medical technology, as well as associated general disciplines such as terminology and symbols, electromagnetic compatibility (by its Advisory Committee on Electromagnetic Compatibility, ACEC), measurement and performance, dependability, design and development, safety and the environment. 

ISO 9660<====>15145<====>ISO 9660   ISO 9660 is a file system for optical disc media. Being published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) the file system is considered an international technical standard. Since the specification is available for anybody to purchase,  implementations have been written for many operating systems. HistoryISO 9660 traces its roots to the High Sierra Format file system.   High Sierra arranged file information in a dense, sequential layout to minimize nonsequential access by using a hierarchical (eight levels of directories deep) tree file system arrangement, similar to UNIX and FAT.  To facilitate cross platform compatibility, it defined a minimal set of common file attributes (directory or ordinary file and time of recording) and name attributes (name, extension, and version), and used a separate system use area where future optional extensions for each file may be specified. 

Ice skating<====>15146<====>Ice skating Ice skating is the act of moving on ice by using ice skates.  It can be done for a variety of reasons, including exercise, leisure, traveling and various sports.  Ice skating occurs both on specially prepared ice surfaces (arenas, tracks, parks), both indoors and outdoors, as well as on naturally occurring bodies of frozen water, such as ponds, lakes and rivers. HistoryEarly history of ice skatingA study by Federico Formenti of the University of Oxford suggests that the earliest ice skating happened in southern Finland more than 3,000 years ago.   Originally, skates were merely sharpened, flattened bone strapped to the bottom of the foot. 

International Olympic Committee<====>15147<====>International Olympic CommitteeThe International Olympic Committee (IOC; French: Comité International Olympique, CIO) is the supreme authority of the worldwide Olympic movement.  Based in Lausanne, Switzerland, IOC is a non-profit independent international organisation made up of volunteers, which is committed to building a better world through sport.  It redistributes more than 90 percent of its income to the wider sporting movement, which means that every day the equivalent of US$ 3. 4 million goes to help athletes and sports organisations at all levels around the world.  Its mission is enshrined in the Olympic Charter: to support the development of competitive sport by ethical and environmentally sustainable means. 

Integrated circuit<====>15150<====>Integrated circuit   An integrated circuit or monolithic integrated circuit (also referred to as an IC, a chip, or a microchip) is a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece (or "chip") of semiconductor material, normally silicon.   The integration of large numbers of tiny transistors into a small chip results in circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller, cheaper, and faster than those constructed of discrete electronic components.  The IC's mass production capability, reliability and building-block approach to circuit design has ensured the rapid adoption of standardized ICs in place of designs using discrete transistors. 

IBM 3270<====>15154<====>IBM 3270 The IBM 3270 is a class of block oriented computer terminal (sometimes called display devices) introduced by IBM in 1971  normally used to communicate with IBM mainframes.  The 3270 was the successor to the IBM 2260 display terminal.   Due to the text colour on the original models, these terminals are informally known as green screen terminals.  Unlike a character-oriented terminal, the 3270 minimizes the number of I/O interrupts required by transferring large blocks of data known as data streams, and uses a high speed proprietary communications interface, using coaxial cable. Although IBM no longer manufactures 3270 terminals, the IBM 3270 protocol is still commonly used via terminal emulation to access mainframe-based applications. 

I. M. Pei<====>15155<====>I.  M.  Pei   Ieoh Ming Pei, FAIA, RIBA I. M.  Pei Biography   – website of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners  (born 26 April 1917), commonly known as I.  M.  Pei, is a Chinese American architect.  In 1948, Pei was recruited by New York City real estate magnate William Zeckendorf.  There he spent seven years before establishing his own independent design firm I.  M.  Pei & Associates in 1955, which became I.  M.  Pei & Partners in 1966 and later in 1989 became Pei Cobb Freed & Partners. 

Intel 80486<====>15161<====>Intel 80486 The Intel 80486, also known as the i486 or 486 ("four-eighty-six"), is a higher performance follow-up to the Intel 80386 microprocessor.  The 80486 was introduced in 1989 and was the first tightly  pipelined x86 design as well as the first x86 chip to use more than a million transistors, due to a large on-chip cache and an integrated floating-point unit.  It represents a fourth generation of binary compatible CPUs since the original 8086 of 1978. A 50 MHz 80486 executes around 40 million instructions per second on average and is able to reach 50 MIPS peak performance. 

Intel 80486SX<====>15164<====>Intel 80486SXIntel's i486SX was a modified Intel 486DX microprocessor with its floating-point unit (FPU) disabled.  It was intended as a lower-cost CPU for use in low-end systems.  Computer manufacturers that used these processors include Packard Bell, Compaq, ZEOS and IBM. OverviewIn the early 1990s, common applications did not need or benefit from an FPU.  Among the rare exceptions were CAD applications, which could often simulate floating point operations in software, but benefited from a hardware floating point unit immensely.  AMD had began manufacturing its 386DX clone which was faster than Intel's.  To respond to this new situation Intel wanted to provide a lower cost i486 CPU for system integrators, but without sacrificing the better profit margins of a "full" i486. 

Ivory<====>15165<====>Ivory Ivory is a hard, white material from the tusks (traditionally elephant's) and teeth of animals, that can be used in art or manufacturing.  It consists mainly of dentine (inorganic formula Ca 10 (PO 4 ) 6 (CO 3 )·H 2 O)), one of the physical structures of teeth and tusks.  The chemical structure of the teeth and tusks of mammals is the same, regardless of the species of origin.  The trade in certain teeth and tusks other than elephant is well established and widespread; therefore, "ivory" can correctly be used to describe any mammalian teeth or tusks of commercial interest which are large enough to be carved or scrimshawed. 

Infantry fighting vehicle<====>15166<====>Infantry fighting vehicle An infantry fighting vehicle (IFV), or infantry combat vehicle (ICV), is a type of armoured fighting vehicle used to carry infantry into battle and provide direct fire support.The Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe defines an infantry fighting vehicle is "an armoured combat vehicle which is designed and equipped primarily to transport a combat infantry squad, and which is armed with an integral or organic cannon of at least 20 millimeters calibre and sometimes an antitank missile launcher".They often serve as both the principal weapons system and mode of transport for a mechanized infantry unit. 

ICQ<====>15167<====>ICQ  ICQ is an instant messaging client that was first developed and popularized by the Israeli company Mirabilis in 1996.  The name ICQ derives from the English phrase "I Seek You".   Ownership of ICQ passed from Mirabilis to AOL in 1998, and from AOL to Mail. Ru Group in 2010. The ICQ client application and service were initially released in November 1996 and the client was freely available to download.  Users could register an account and would be assigned a number, like a phone number, for others to be able to contact them (users could also provide handles). 

Impressionism<====>15169<====>Impressionism Impressionism is a 19th-century art movement characterised by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles.  Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.  The Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France.  The name of the style derives from the title of a Claude Monet work, Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satirical review published in the Parisian newspaper Le Charivari. 

Internet slang<====>15172<====>Internet slang  Internet slang (Internet shorthand, cyber-slang, netspeak, or chatspeak) refers to a variety of slang languages used by different people on the Internet.  An example of Internet slang is " LOL " meaning "laugh out loud".  It is difficult to provide a standardized definition of Internet slang due to the constant changes made to its nature.  Yin Yan (2006) World Wide Web and the Formation of the Chinese and English "Internet Slang Union".  Computer-Assisted Foreign Language Education.  Vol.  1.However, it can be understood to be a type of slang that Internet users have popularized, and in many cases, have coined. 

Impi<====>15174<====>Impi   Impi is a Zulu word for any armed body of men.  However, in English it is often used to refer to a Zulu regiment, which is called an ibutho in Zulu.  Its beginnings lie far back in historic tribal warfare customs, when groups of armed men called impis battled.  They were systematised radically by the Zulu king Shaka, who was then only the exiled illegitimate son of king Senzangakhona, but already showing much prowess as a general in the army of Mthethwa king Dingiswayo in the Mthethwa-Ndwandwe war in the early 1810s. Genesis of the impiThe Zulu impi is popularly identified with the ascent of Shaka, ruler of the relatively small Zulu tribe before its explosion across the landscape of southern Africa, but its earliest shape as a purposeful instrument of statecraft lies in the innovations of the Mwetha chieftain Dingiswayo, according to some historians (Morris 1965). 

Irish mythology<====>15175<====>Irish mythology    The mythology of pre-Christian Ireland did not entirely survive the conversion to Christianity.  However, much of it was preserved in medieval Irish literature, though it was shorn of its religious meanings.  This literature represents the most extensive and best preserved of all the branches of Celtic mythology.  Although many of the manuscripts have not survived and much more material was probably never committed to writing, there is enough remaining to enable the identification of distinct, if overlapping, cycles: the Mythological Cycle, the Ulster Cycle, the Fenian Cycle and the Historical Cycle.  There are also a number of extant mythological texts that do not fit into any of the cycles. 

Insurance<====>15176<====>Insurance  Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss.   It is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent, uncertain loss. An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer, insurance company, or insurance carrier.   A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or policyholder.  The insurance transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss. 

Indira Gandhi<====>15179<====>Indira Gandhi   Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi ( ;  ; 19 November 1917 – 31 October 1984) was an Indian stateswoman and central figure of the Indian National Congress.   She was the first and, to date, the only female Prime Minister of India.  Gandhi belonged to the Nehru–Gandhi family and was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Indian prime minister.  Despite her surname Gandhi, she is not related to the family of Mahatma Gandhi.  She served as Prime Minister from January 1966 to March 1977 and again from January 1980 until her assassination in October 1984, making her the second longest-serving Indian prime minister after her father. 

Intergovernmentalism<====>15180<====>Intergovernmentalism  in political science, intergovernmentalism treats states, and national governments in particular, as the primary actors in the integration process.Intergovernmentalist approaches claim to be able to explain both periods of radical change in the European Union because of converging governmental preferences and periods of inertia because of diverging national interests.  Intergovernmentalism is distinguishable from realism and neorealism because of its recognition of the significance of institutionalisation in international politics and the impact of domestic politics upon governmental preferences. Regional integrationEuropean IntegrationThe best-known example of regional integration is the European Union (EU), an economic and political intergovernmental organisation of 28 member states, all in Europe. 

Individualism<====>15181<====>Individualism  Individualism is the moral stance, political philosophy, ideology, or social outlook that emphasizes the moral worth of the individual.  "Individualism" on Encyclopædia Britannica Online    Individualists promote the exercise of one's goals and desires and so value independence and self-reliance "individualism" on The Free Dictionary  and advocate that interests of the individual should achieve precedence over the state or a social group,  while opposing external interference upon one's own interests by society or institutions such as the government.   Individualism is often defined in contrast to totalitarianism, collectivism, authoritarianism, communitarianism, statism, tribalism, and more corporate social forms. 

In vivo<====>15187<====>In vivo  Studies that are in vivo (Latin for "within the living"; often not italicized in English  ) are those in which the effects of various biological entities are tested on whole, living organisms or cells, usually  animals, including humans, and plants, as opposed to a tissue extract or dead organism.  This is not to be confused with experiments done in vitro ("within the glass"), i. e. , in a laboratory environment using test tubes, petri dishes, etc.  Examples of investigations in vivo include: the pathogenesis of disease by comparing the effects of bacterial infection   with the effects of  purified bacterial toxins; the development of antibiotics, antiviral drugs, and new drugs generally; and new surgical procedures. 

In vitro<====>15188<====>In vitro  In vitro (meaning: in the glass) studies are performed with microorganisms, cells, or biological molecules outside their normal biological context.   Colloquially called "test-tube experiments", these studies in biology and its subdisciplines are traditionally done in labware such as test tubes, flasks, Petri dishes, and microtiter plates.  Studies conducted using components of an organism that have been isolated from their usual biological surroundings permit a more detailed or more convenient analysis than can be done with whole organisms; however, results obtained from in vitro experiments may not fully or accurately predict the effects on a whole organism. 

IEEE 754-1985<====>15189<====>IEEE 754-1985IEEE 754-1985 was an industry standard for representing floating-point numbers in computers, officially adopted in 1985 and superseded in 2008 by IEEE 754-2008.  During its 23 years, it was the most widely used format for floating-point computation.  It was implemented in software, in the form of floating-point libraries, and in hardware, in the instructions of many CPUs and FPUs.  The first integrated circuit to implement the draft of what was to become IEEE 754-1985 was the Intel 8087. IEEE 754-1985 represents numbers in binary, providing definitions for four levels of precision, of which the two most commonly used are:Level Width Range at full precision Precision  Single precision 32 bits ±1. 

Intel 80186<====>15190<====>Intel 80186 The Intel 80186, also known as the iAPX 186,    or just 186, is a microprocessor and microcontroller introduced in 1982.  It was based on the Intel 8086 and, like it, had a 16-bit external data bus multiplexed with a 20-bit address bus.  It was also available as the 80188, with an 8-bit external data bus. DescriptionFeatures and performanceThe 80186 series was generally intended for embedded systems, as microcontrollers with external memory.  Therefore, to reduce the number of integrated circuits required, it included features such as clock generator, interrupt controller, timers, wait state generator, DMA channels, and external chip select lines. 

Inquisition<====>15191<====>Inquisition The Inquisition was a group of institutions within the government system of the Catholic Church whose aim was to combat heresy.  It started in 12th-century France to combat religious sectarianism, in particular the Cathars and the Waldensians.  Other groups investigated later included the Spiritual Franciscans, the Hussites (followers of Jan Hus) and Beguines.  Beginning in the 1250s, inquisitors were generally chosen from members of the Dominican Order, replacing the earlier practice of using local clergy as judges.   The term Medieval Inquisition covers these courts up to mid-15th century. During the Late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, the concept and scope of the Inquisition significantly expanded in response to the Protestant Reformation and the Catholic Counter-Reformation. 

Isaac<====>15192<====>Isaac  According to the biblical Book of Genesis, Isaac ( ;  ;  ,  ) was the son of Abraham and Sarah and father of Jacob; his name means "he will laugh", reflecting when Sarah laughed in disbelief  when told that she would have a child.   In the Bible, he is one of the three patriarchs of the Israelites, the only one whose name was not changed, and the only one who did not move out of Canaan.   According to the narrative, he died when he was 180 years old, the longest-lived of the three. 

Italian Football League<====>15193<====>Italian Football League  Italian Football League (IFL) is an American football league in Italy. HistoryThe league was founded in 2008, taking over previous league's significance (National Football League Italy).  The league was born as a result of the escape of several of the best clubs of the old championship organized by the Italian federation, such as Milano Rhinos, Parma Panthers, Bologna Doves and Bolzano Giants.  However some of the historic Italian clubs have not joined the new league and continue to participate in different tournaments organized by other federations.  This is the case of Legnano Frogs, Torino Giaguari, etc. 

Papua (province)<====>15199<====>Papua (province)  Papua is the largest and easternmost province of Indonesia, comprising most of Western New Guinea.  Papua is bordered by the nation of Papua New Guinea to the east, and by West Papua province to the west.  Since 2002, Papua province has special autonomy status   , making it a special region.  Its capital is Jayapura.  It was formerly called Irian Jaya (and earlier West Irian or Irian Barat) and comprised all of Indonesian New Guinea.  In 2002 the current name was adopted and in 2003 West Papua province was created from western parts of Papua province. 

Interdisciplinarity<====>15201<====>Interdisciplinarity  Interdisciplinarity involves the combining of two or more academic disciplines into one activity (e. g. , a research project).  It draws knowledge from several other fields like sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics etc.   It is about creating something new by thinking across boundaries.  It is related to an interdiscipline or an interdisciplinary field, which is an organizational unit that crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines or schools of thought, as new needs and professions emerge.  Large engineering teams are usually interdisciplinary, as a power station or mobile phone or other project requires the melding of several specialties. 

Insertion sort<====>15205<====>Insertion sort Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.  It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.  However, insertion sort provides several advantages:Simple implementation: Jon Bentley shows a three-line C version, and a five-line optimized version   Efficient for (quite) small data sets, much like other quadratic sorting algorithmsMore efficient in practice than most other simple quadratic (i. e. , O(n 2 )) algorithms such as selection sort or bubble sort Adaptive, i. 

Ig Nobel Prize<====>15207<====>Ig Nobel Prize   The Ig Nobel Prize is a parody of the Nobel Prize, which is awarded every autumn to celebrate ten unusual or trivial achievements in scientific research.  Since 1991, the Ig Nobel Prizes have been awarded to “honor achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think. ” The name of the award, the “Ig Nobel Prize” (   ) is a pun on the word  , an achievement “characterized by baseness, lowness, or meanness”, and is satirical social criticism that identifies absurd-sounding, yet useful research and knowledge.  Organized by the scientific humor magazine, the Annals of Improbable Research (AIR), the Ig Nobel Prizes are presented by Nobel laureates in a ceremony at the Sanders Theater, Harvard University, and are followed by the winners’ public lectures at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

Isaac Albéniz<====>15208<====>Isaac AlbénizIsaac Manuel Francisco Albéniz y Pascual ( ; 29 May 1860 18 May 1909) was a Spanish virtuoso pianist, composer, and conductor.  He is one of the foremost composers of the Post-Romantic era who also had a significant influence on his contemporaries and younger composers.  He is best known for his piano works based on Spanish folk music idioms.  Transcriptions of many of his pieces, such as Asturias (Leyenda), Granada, Sevilla, Cadiz, Córdoba, Cataluña, and the Tango in D, are important pieces for classical guitar, though he never composed for the guitar. 

ITU-R<====>15210<====>ITU-RThe ITU Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) is one of the three sectors (divisions or units) of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and is responsible for radio communication.  Its role is to manage the international radio-frequency spectrum and satellite orbit resources and to develop standards for radiocommunication systems with the objective of ensuring the effective use of the spectrum.  ITU is required, according to its Constitution, to allocate spectrum and register frequency allocation, orbital positions and other parameters of satellites, “in order to avoid harmful interference between radio stations of different countries”.  The international spectrum management system is therefore based on regulatory procedures for frequency coordination, notification and registration. 

Irish Civil War<====>15214<====>Irish Civil WarThe Irish Civil War ( ; 28 June 1922 – 24 May 1923) was a conflict that followed the Irish War of Independence and accompanied the establishment of the Irish Free State, an entity independent from the United Kingdom but within the British Empire. The civil war was waged between two opposing groups, Irish republicans and Irish nationalists, over the Anglo-Irish Treaty.  The forces of the Provisional Government (which became the Free State in December 1922) supported the Treaty, while the Republican opposition saw it as a betrayal of the Irish Republic (which had been proclaimed during the Easter Rising). 

Internet Explorer<====>15215<====>Internet Explorer   Internet Explorer  (formerly Microsoft Internet Explorer  and Windows Internet Explorer,  commonly abbreviated IE or MSIE) is a series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft and included in the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, starting in 1995.  It was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 that year.  Later versions were available as free downloads, or in service packs, and included in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) service releases of Windows 95 and later versions of Windows.  The browser is discontinued, but still maintained. 

Imprecise language<====>15220<====>Imprecise language Often, informal, spoken language, "everyday language" is less precise than any more formal  or academic languages. Language might be said to be imprecise because it exhibits one or more of the following features:ambiguity – when a word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs. vagueness – when borderline cases interfere with an interpretationequivocation – the misleading use of a term with more than one meaning or sense (by glossing over which meaning is intended at a particular time)accent – when the use of bold or italics causes confusion over the meaning of a statementamphiboly – when a sentence may be interpreted in more than one way due to ambiguous sentence structure. 

Intel 80188<====>15221<====>Intel 80188 The Intel 80188 microprocessor was a variant of the Intel 80186.  The 80188 had an 8-bit external data bus instead of the 16-bit bus of the 80186; this made it less expensive to connect to peripherals.  The 16-bit registers and the one megabyte address range were unchanged, however.  It had a throughput of 1 million instructions per second.  DescriptionFeatures and performanceThe 80188 series was generally intended for embedded systems, as microcontrollers with external memory.  Therefore, to reduce the number of chips required, it included features such as clock generator, interrupt controller, timers, wait state generator, DMA channels, and external chip select lines. 

IEEE 802.2<====>15222<====>IEEE 802. 2IEEE 802. 2 is the original name of the ISO/IEC 8802-2 standard which defines logical link control (LLC) as the upper portion of the data link layer of the OSI Model.   The original standard developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in collaboration with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) was adopted by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1998, but it still remains an integral part of the family of IEEE 802 standards for local and metropolitan networks. LLC is a software component that provides a uniform interface to the user of the data link service, usually the network layer. 

Invertebrate<====>15223<====>Invertebrate  Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a backbone or spine), derived from the notochord.  This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata.  Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; jellyfish, and worms. The majority of animal species are invertebrates; one estimate puts the figure at 97%.    Many invertebrate taxa have a greater number and variety of species than the entire subphylum of Vertebrata.    Some of the so-called invertebrates, such as the Tunicata and Cephalochordata are more closely related to the vertebrates than to other invertebrates. 

Ivar Aasen<====>15225<====>Ivar Aasen Ivar Andreas Aasen ( ; 5 August 1813 – 23 September 1896) was a Norwegian philologist, lexicographer, playwright, and poet.   He is best known for having assembled from dialects one of the two official written versions of the Norwegian language, Nynorsk.  BackgroundAasen was born at Åsen in Ørsta (then Ørsten), in the district of Sunnmøre, on the west coast of Norway.  His father, a peasant with a small farm, Ivar Jonsson, died in 1826.  The younger Ivar was brought up to farmwork, but he assiduously cultivated all his leisure in reading.  An early interest of his was botany. 

Irredentism<====>15226<====>Irredentism Irredentism (from Italian irredento for "unredeemed") is any political or popular movement intended to reclaim and reoccupy an area that the movement's members consider "lost" or "unredeemed".  These territorial claims are justified on the basis of real or imagined national and historic (an area formerly part of that state) or ethnic (an area inhabited by that nation or ethnic group) affiliations.  It is often advocated by nationalist and pan-nationalist movements and has been a feature of identity politics and cultural and political geography. An area that may be subjected to a potential claim is sometimes called an irredenta. 

Inuit languages<====>15227<====>Inuit languages   The Inuit languages are a closely related group of indigenous American languages traditionally spoken across the North American Arctic and to some extent in the subarctic in Labrador.  The related Yupik languages are spoken in western and southern Alaska and in the far east of Russia, but are severely endangered in Russia today and spoken only in a few villages on the Chukchi Peninsula.  The Inuit live primarily in three countries: Greenland, Canada (specifically in the Nunatsiavut region of Labrador, the Nunavik region of Quebec, Nunavut, and the Northwest Territories), and the United States (specifically the coast of Alaska). 

Ibn Battuta<====>15229<====>Ibn Battuta  Muhammad Ibn Battuta or   ( ;  ; February 25, 1304 1368 or 1369), fully   ( ), was a Moroccan scholar who widely travelled the medieval world.    Over a period of thirty years, Ibn Battuta visited most of the Islamic world and many non-Muslim lands, including North Africa, the Horn of Africa, West Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and China.  Near the end of his life, he dictated an account of his journeys, titled A Gift to Those Who Contemplate the Wonders of Cities and the Marvels of Travelling ( , Tuḥfat an-Nuẓẓār fī Gharāʾib al-Amṣār wa ʿAjāʾib al-Asfār), M-S p. 

Integrated Services Digital Network<====>15231<====>Integrated Services Digital Network   Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a set of communication standards for simultaneous digital transmission of voice, video, data, and other network services over the traditional circuits of the public switched telephone network.  It was first defined in 1988 in the CCITT red book.    Prior to ISDN, the telephone system was viewed as a way to transport voice, with some special services available for data.  The key feature of ISDN is that it integrates speech and data on the same lines, adding features that were not available in the classic telephone system. 

Genomic imprinting<====>15235<====>Genomic imprintingGenomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon that causes genes to be expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner.Forms of genomic imprinting have been demonstrated in fungi, plants and animals. As of 2014, there are about 150 imprinted genes known in the mouse and about half that in humans.    Genomic imprinting is an inheritance process independent of the classical Mendelian inheritance.  It is an epigenetic process that involves DNA methylation and histone methylation without altering the genetic sequence.  These epigenetic marks are established ("imprinted") in the germline (sperm or egg cells) of the parents and are maintained through mitotic cell divisions in the somatic cells of an organism. 

ICANN<====>15236<====>ICANN  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN    ) is a nonprofit organization responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces of the Internet, ensuring the network's stable and secure operation.    ICANN performs the actual technical maintenance work of the Central Internet Address pools and DNS root zone registries pursuant to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) function contract.  The contract regarding the IANA stewardship functions between ICANN and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the United States Department of Commerce ended on October 1, 2016, formally transitioning the functions to the global multistakeholder community. 

Iterative method<====>15237<====>Iterative methodIn computational mathematics, an iterative method is a mathematical procedure that generates a sequence of improving approximate solutions  for a class of problems, in which the n-th approximation is derived from the previous ones.  A specific implementation of an iterative method, including the termination criteria, is an algorithm of the iterative method.  An iterative method is called convergent if the corresponding sequence converges for given initial approximations.  A mathematically rigorous convergence analysis of an iterative method is usually performed; however, heuristic-based iterative methods are also common.  In the problems of finding the root of an equation (or a solution of a system of equations), an iterative method uses an initial guess to generate successive approximations to a solution. 

International judicial institution<====>15238<====>International judicial institution International judicial institutions can be divided into courts, arbitral tribunals and quasi-judicial institutions.  Courts are permanent bodies, with near the same composition for each case.  Arbitral tribunals, by contrast, are constituted anew for each case.  Both courts and arbitral tribunals can make binding decisions.  Quasi-judicial institutions, by contrast, make rulings on cases, but these rulings are not in themselves legally binding; the main example is the individual complaints mechanisms available under the various UN human rights treaties. Institutions can also be divided into global and regional institutions. The listing below incorporates both currently existing institutions, defunct institutions that no longer exist, institutions which never came into existence due to non-ratification of their constitutive instruments, and institutions which do not yet exist, but for which constitutive instruments have been signed. 

International Prize Court<====>15239<====>International Prize CourtThe International Prize Court was an international court proposed at the beginning of the 20th century, to hear prize cases.  An international agreement to create it, the Convention Relative to the Creation of an International Prize Court, was made at the Second Hague Conference in 1907 but never came into force. The capturing of  prizes (enemy equipment, vehicles, and especially ships) during wartime is a tradition that goes back as far as organized warfare itself.  The International Prize Court was to hear appeals from national courts concerning prize cases.  Even as a draft, the convention was innovative for the time, in being both the first ever treaty for a truly international court (as opposed to a mere arbitral tribunal), and in providing individuals with access to the court, going against the prevailing doctrines of international law at the time, according to which only states had rights and duties under international law. 

Imam<====>15240<====>Imam    Imam ( ;    ; plural:    ) is an Islamic leadership position.  It is most commonly used as the title of a worship leader of a mosque and Muslim community among Sunni Muslims.  In this context, imams may lead Islamic worship services, serve as community leaders, and provide religious guidance.  For Shi'a Muslims, the imam has a more central meaning and role in Islam through the concept of imamah; the term is only applicable to those members of Ahl al-Bayt, the house of the prophet Muhammad, designated as infallibles. 

Instrument flight rules<====>15242<====>Instrument flight rules  Instrument flight rules (IFR) is one of two sets of regulations governing all aspects of civil aviation aircraft operations; the other is visual flight rules (VFR). The U. S.  Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Instrument Flying Handbook defines IFR as: "Rules and regulations established by the FAA to govern flight under conditions in which flight by outside visual reference is not safe.  IFR flight depends upon flying by reference to instruments in the flight deck, and navigation is accomplished by reference to electronic signals. "    It is also a term used by pilots and controllers to indicate the type of flight plan an aircraft is flying, such as an IFR or VFR flight plan. 

Ismail Khan<====>15245<====>Ismail Khan  Mohammad Ismail Khan (Persian: محمد اسماعیل خان) (born 1946) is a politician in Afghanistan, serving as Minister of Water and Energy since 2005.  He was previously the Governor of Herat Province.  He is widely known as a warlord because of his rise to power during the Soviet-Afghan War  when he controlled a large sized mujahideen force, mainly his fellow Tajiks from western Afghanistan.

Indigo<====>15250<====>Indigo   Indigo is a deep and rich color close to the color wheel blue (a primary color in the RGB color space), as well as to some variants of ultramarine.  It is traditionally regarded as a color in the visible spectrum, as well as one of the seven colors of the rainbow: the color between blue and violet; however, sources differ as to its actual position in the electromagnetic spectrum. The color indigo is named after the indigo dye derived from the plant Indigofera tinctoria and related species. The first known recorded use of indigo as a color name in English was in 1289. 

International Monetary Fund<====>15251<====>International Monetary FundThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international organization headquartered in Washington, D. C. , of "189 countries working to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world. "    Formed in 1945 at the Bretton Woods Conference primarily by the ideas of Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes,  it came into formal existence in 1945 with 29 member countries and the goal of reconstructing the international payment system.  It now plays a central role in the management of balance of payments difficulties and international financial crises. 

Islands of the Clyde<====>15252<====>Islands of the ClydeThe Islands of the Firth of Clyde are the fifth largest of the major Scottish island groups after the Inner and Outer Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland.  They are situated in the Firth of Clyde between Ayrshire and Argyll and Bute.  There are about forty islands and skerries, of which only four are inhabited and only nine larger than  . The definition of an island used is that it is land that is surrounded by seawater on a daily basis, but not necessarily at all stages of the tide, excluding human devices such as bridges and causeways. 

International Bank Account Number<====>15253<====>International Bank Account NumberThe International Bank Account Number (IBAN) is an internationally agreed system of identifying bank accounts across national borders to facilitate the communication and processing of cross border transactions with a reduced risk of transcription errors.  It was originally adopted by the European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS), and later as an international standard under ISO 13616:1997.  The current standard is ISO 13616:2007, which indicates SWIFT as the formal registrar.  Initially developed to facilitate payments within the European Union, it has been implemented by most European countries and numerous countries in the other parts of the world, mainly in the Middle East and in the Caribbean. 

Infinitive<====>15254<====>InfinitiveInfinitive (abbreviated  ) is a grammatical term referring to certain verb forms existing in many languages, most often used as non-finite verbs.  As with many linguistic concepts, there is not a single definition applicable to all languages.  The word is derived from Late Latin [modus] infinitivus, a derivative of infinitus meaning "unlimited". In traditional descriptions of English, the infinitive is the basic dictionary form of a verb when used non-finitely, with or without the particle to.  Thus to go is an infinitive, as is go in a sentence like "I must go there" (but not in "I go there", where it is a finite verb). 

Immaculate Conception<====>15256<====>Immaculate Conception   The Immaculate Conception, according to the teaching of the Catholic Church, is the conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary free from original sin by virtue of the merits of her son Jesus Christ.  The Catholic Church teaches that God acted upon Mary in the first moment of her conception keeping her "immaculate".  The Immaculate Conception is commonly confused with the Virgin Birth of Jesus.  Jesus' birth is covered by the Doctrine of Incarnation, while the Immaculate Conception deals with the conception of Mary, not that of her son. Although the belief that Mary was sinless, or conceived without original sin, has been widely held since Late Antiquity, the doctrine was not dogmatically defined until 1854, by Pope Pius IX in his papal bull Ineffabilis Deus. 

Islands of the North Atlantic<====>15260<====>Islands of the North Atlantic  IONA (Islands of the North Atlantic) is an acronym suggested in 1980 by Sir John Biggs-Davison to refer to a loose linkage of  England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, the Isle of Man and Channel Islands, similar to the present day British-Irish Council.    Its intended purpose was as a more politically acceptable alternative to British Isles, which is disliked by many people in Ireland.  The neologism has been criticised on the grounds that it excludes most of the islands in the North Atlantic, and also that the only island referred to by the term that is actually in the North Atlantic Ocean is Ireland. 

Intel DX4<====>15261<====>Intel DX4The IntelDX4 is a clock-tripled i486 microprocessor with 16 kB L1 cache.  Intel named it DX4 (rather than DX3) as a consequence of litigation with AMD over trademarks.   The product was officially named the IntelDX4, but OEMs continued using the i486 naming convention. Intel produced IntelDX4s with two clock speed steppings: A 75 MHz version (3× 25 MHz multiplier), and a 100 MHz version (usually 3× 33. 3 MHz, but sometimes also 2× 50 MHz).  Both chips were released in March 1994.  A version of the IntelDX4 featuring write-back cache was released in October 1994.  The original write-through versions of the chip are marked with a laser embossed "&E", while the write-back enabled versions are marked "&EW". 

Interactive Fiction Competition<====>15266<====>Interactive Fiction CompetitionThe Interactive Fiction Competition (also known as IFComp) is one of several annual competitions for works of interactive fiction.  It has been held since 1995.  It is intended for fairly short games, as judges are only allowed to spend two hours playing a game before deciding how many points to award it.  The competition has been described as the "Super Bowl" of interactive fiction.  A reviewer for The A. V.  Club said of the 2008 competition, "Once again, the IF Competition delivers some of the best writing in games. " The 2008 competition was described as containing "some real standouts both in quality of puzzles and a willingness to stretch the definition of text adventures/interactive fiction. 

Inquests in England and Wales<====>15268<====>Inquests in England and WalesInquests in England and Wales are held into sudden and unexplained deaths and also into the circumstances of discovery of a certain class of valuable artefacts known as "treasure trove".  In England and Wales inquests are the responsibility of a coroner, who operates under the jurisdiction of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. Where an inquest is neededThere is a general duty upon every person to report a death to the coroner if an inquest is likely to be required.  However, this duty is largely unenforceable in practice and the duty falls on the responsible registrar. 

Information retrieval<====>15271<====>Information retrievalInformation retrieval (IR) is the activity of obtaining information resources relevant to an information need from a collection of information resources.   Searches can be based on full-text or other content-based indexing.  Information retrieval is the science of searching for information in a document, searching for documents themselves, and also searching for metadata that describe data, and for databases of texts, images or sounds. Automated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called information overload.  Many universities and public libraries use IR systems to provide access to books, journals and other documents.  Web search engines are the most visible IR applications.

International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia<====>15274<====>International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia   The International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, more commonly referred to as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), was a body of the United Nations established to prosecute serious crimes committed during the Yugoslav Wars, and to try their perpetrators.  The tribunal was an ad hoc court located in The Hague, Netherlands. The Court was established by Resolution 827 of the United Nations Security Council, which was passed on 25 May 1993. 

ISO 216<====>15275<====>ISO 216ISO 216 specifies international standard (ISO) paper sizes used in most countries in the world today, although not in Canada, the United States, Mexico, or the Dominican Republic.  The standard defines the "A" and "B" series of paper sizes, including A4, the most commonly available size.  Two supplementary standards, ISO 217 and ISO 269, define related paper sizes; the ISO 269 "C" series is commonly listed alongside the A and B sizes. All ISO 216, ISO 217 and ISO 269 paper sizes (except some envelopes) have the same aspect ratio,  \sqrt{2} ,  within rounding to millimetres. 

ISO 3864<====>15276<====>ISO 3864ISO 3864 specifies international standards for safety symbols. These labels are graphical, to overcome language barriers.  The standard is split into four parts:ISO 3864-1:2011 Part 1: Design principles for safety signs and safetyISO 3864-2:2016 Part 2: Design principles for product safety labelsISO 3864-3:2012 Part 3: Design principles for graphical symbols for use in safety signsISO 3864-4:2011 Part 4: Colorimetric and photometric properties of safety sign materialsThe corresponding American standard is ANSI Z535, which is incompatible with the ISO standard. ANSI standard ANSI Z535.6-2006 defines an optional accompanying text in one or more languages.References   

Isaac Abendana<====>15281<====>Isaac AbendanaIsaac Abendana (ca.  1640 – 1699) was the younger brother of Jacob Abendana, and became hakam of the Spanish Portuguese Synagogue in London after his brother died.   Abendana moved to England before his brother, in 1662, and taught Hebrew at Cambridge University.  He completed an unpublished Latin translation of the Mishnah for the university in 1671.  While he was at Cambridge, Abendana sold Hebrew books to the Bodleian Library of Oxford, and in 1689 he took a teaching position in Magdalen College.  In Oxford, he wrote a series of Jewish almanacs for Christians, which he later collected and compiled as the Discourses on the Ecclesiastical and Civil Polity of the Jews (1706).

Internet Engineering Task Force<====>15285<====>Internet Engineering Task Force   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) develops and promotes voluntary Internet standards, in particular the standards that comprise the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP).  It is an open standards organization, with no formal membership or membership requirements.  All participants and managers are volunteers, though their work is usually funded by their employers or sponsors.  The IETF started out as an activity supported by the U. S.  federal government, but since 1993 it has operated as a standards development function under the auspices of the Internet Society, an international membership-based non-profit organization. 

ISM band<====>15286<====>ISM bandThe industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio bands are radio bands (portions of the radio spectrum) reserved internationally for the use of radio frequency (RF) energy for industrial, scientific and medical purposes other than telecommunications.   Examples of applications in these bands include radio-frequency process heating, microwave ovens, and medical diathermy machines.   The powerful emissions of these devices can create electromagnetic interference and disrupt radio communication using the same frequency, so these devices  were limited to certain bands of frequencies.  In general, communications equipment operating in these bands must tolerate any interference generated by ISM applications, and users have no regulatory protection from ISM device operation. 

Series (mathematics)<====>15287<====>Series (mathematics)  In mathematics, a series is, roughly speaking, a description of the operation of adding infinitely many quantities, one after the other, to a given starting quantity.    The study of series is a major part of calculus and its generalization, mathematical analysis.  Series are used in most areas of mathematics, even for studying finite structures (such as in combinatorics), through generating functions.  In addition to their ubiquity in mathematics, infinite series are also widely used in other quantitative disciplines such as physics, computer science, statistics and finance. For a long time, the idea that such a potentially infinite summation could produce a finite result was considered paradoxical by mathematicians and philosophers. 

Interrupt<====>15289<====>Interrupt   In system programming, an interrupt is a signal to the processor emitted by hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention.  An interrupt alerts the processor to a high-priority condition requiring the interruption of the current code the processor is executing.   The processor responds by suspending its current activities, saving its state, and executing a function called an interrupt handler (or an interrupt service routine, ISR) to deal with the event.   This interruption is temporary, and, after the interrupt handler finishes, the processor resumes normal activities.    There are two types of interrupts: hardware interrupts and software interrupts. 

Intercalation (timekeeping)<====>15290<====>Intercalation (timekeeping) Intercalation or embolism in timekeeping is the insertion of a leap day, week, or month into some calendar years to make the calendar follow the seasons or moon phases.  Lunisolar calendars may require intercalations of both days and months. Solar calendars The solar or tropical year does not have a whole number of days (it is about 365. 24 days), but a calendar year must have a whole number of days.  The most common way to reconcile the two is to vary the number of days in the calendar year. In solar calendars, this is done by adding to a common year of 365 days, an extra day ("leap day" or "intercalary day") about every four years, causing a leap year to have 366 days (Julian, Gregorian and Indian national calendars). 

Ink<====>15292<====>Ink Ink is a liquid or paste that contains pigments or dyes and is used to color a surface to produce an image, text, or design.  Ink is used for drawing or writing with a pen, brush, or quill.  Thicker inks, in paste form, are used extensively in letterpress and lithographic printing. Ink can be a complex medium, composed of solvents, pigments, dyes, resins, lubricants, solubilizers, surfactants, particulate matter, fluorescents, and other materials.  The components of inks serve many purposes; the ink's carrier, colorants, and other additives affect the flow and thickness of the ink and its dry appearance. 

Islamabad Capital Territory<====>15294<====>Islamabad Capital Territory   {{Infobox settlement }}The Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) ( ) is one of the two federal territories of Pakistan.  It includes Islamabad, the capital city of Pakistan, and covers an area of 1,165. 5 km 2  (450 mi 2 ) of which 906 km 2  (349. 8 mi 2 ) is Islamabad proper.  It is represented in the National Assembly by two constituencies, namely NA-48 and NA-49.  HistoryIn 1960, land was transferred from the Rawalpindi District of the Punjab province for the purpose of establishing Pakistan's new capital.  According to the 1960 master plan, the ICT included the city of Rawalpindi, and was to be composed of the following parts:   Rawalpindi,  Islamabad Proper (including the institutional and industrial areas),  Islamabad (Margalla Hills) Park,  Islamabad Rural Area,  However, the city of Rawalpindi was eventually excluded from the ICT on its creation in the 1980s. 

Intelligent design<====>15295<====>Intelligent design Intelligent design (ID) is a   religious argument for the existence of God, presented by its proponents as "an evidence-based scientific theory about life's origins", Numbers 2006, p.  373; "[ID] captured headlines for its bold attempt to rewrite the basic rules of science and its claim to have found indisputable evidence of a God-like being.  Proponents, however, insisted it was 'not a religious-based idea, but instead an evidence-based scientific theory about life's origins – one that challenges strictly materialistic views of evolution. ' Although the intellectual roots of the design argument go back centuries, its contemporary incarnation dates from the 1980s". 

Integrin<====>15302<====>Integrin  Integrins are transmembrane receptors that facilitate cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion.  Upon ligand binding, integrins activate signal transduction pathways that mediate cellular signals such as regulation of the cell cycle, organization of the intracellular cytoskeleton, and movement of new receptors to the cell membrane.   The presence of integrins allows rapid and flexible responses to events at the cell surface (e. g.  signal platelets to initiate an interaction with coagulation factors). Several types of integrins exist, and one cell may have multiple different types on its surface.  Integrins are found in all animals while integrin-like receptors are found in plant cells. 

Ion channel<====>15303<====>Ion channel Ion channels are pore-forming membrane proteins that allow ions to pass through the channel pore.  Their functions include establishing a resting membrane potential, shaping action potentials and other electrical signals by gating the flow of ions across the cell membrane, controlling the flow of ions across secretory and epithelial cells, and regulating cell volume.  Ion channels are present in the membranes of all  cells.  Ion channels are one of the two classes of ionophoric proteins, along with ion transporters (including the sodium-potassium pump, sodium-calcium exchanger, and sodium-glucose transport proteins).    The study of ion channels often involves biophysics, electrophysiology, and pharmacology, while using techniques including voltage clamp, patch clamp, immunohistochemistry, X-ray crystallography, fluoroscopy, and RT-PCR.

Integrated development environment<====>15305<====>Integrated development environment An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.  An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger.  Most modern IDEs have intelligent code completion.  Some IDEs, such as NetBeans and Eclipse, contain a compiler, interpreter, or both; others, such as SharpDevelop and Lazarus, do not.  The boundary between an integrated development environment and other parts of the broader software development environment is not well-defined.  Sometimes a version control system, or various tools to simplify the construction of a Graphical User Interface (GUI), are integrated. 

Ian McKellen<====>15308<====>Ian McKellen    Sir Ian Murray McKellen,   (born 25 May 1939) is an English actor.  He is the recipient of six Laurence Olivier Awards, a Tony Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BIF Award, two Saturn Awards, four Drama Desk Awards, and two Critics' Choice Awards.  He has also received two Oscar nominations, four BAFTA nominations and five Emmy Award nominations. McKellen's career spans genres ranging from Shakespearean and modern theatre to popular fantasy and science fiction.  The BBC states his "performances have guaranteed him a place in the canon of English stage and film actors". 

Intellivision<====>15309<====>Intellivision The Intellivision is a home video game console released by Mattel Electronics in 1979.   The name Intellivision is a portmanteau of "intelligent television".   Development of the console began in 1977, the same year as the introduction of its main competitor, the Atari 2600.In 1984 Mattel sold the Intellivision business to a former Mattel Electronics executive and investors that would become INTV Corporation.   Games development started in 1978 and continued until 1990 when the Intellivision was discontinued.  From 1980 to 1983 over 3 million Intellivision units were sold. 

Imperialism<====>15316<====>Imperialism  Imperialism is an action that involves a country (usually an empire or a kingdom) extending its power by the acquisition of territories.  It may also include the exploitation of these territories, an action that is linked to colonialism.   Colonialism is generally regarded as an expression of imperialism. It is different from New Imperialism, as the term imperialism is usually applied to the colonization of the Americas between the 15th and 19th centuries, as opposed to the expansion of Western Powers (and Japan) during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  However, both are examples of imperialism. 

IPv4<====>15317<====>IPv4Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP).  It is one of the core protocols of standards-based internetworking methods in the Internet, and was the first version deployed for production in the ARPANET in 1983.  It still routes most Internet traffic today,    despite the ongoing deployment of a successor protocol, IPv6.  IPv4 is described in IETF publication RFC 791 (September 1981), replacing an earlier definition (RFC 760, January 1980). IPv4 is a connectionless protocol for use on packet-switched networks.  It operates on a best effort delivery model, in that it does not guarantee delivery, nor does it assure proper sequencing or avoidance of duplicate delivery. 

IPv6<====>15318<====>IPv6   Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP), the communications protocol that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet.  IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion.  IPv6 is intended to replace IPv4.    Every device on the Internet is assigned a unique IP address for identification and location definition.  With the rapid growth of the Internet after commercialization in the 1990s, it became evident that far more addresses would be needed to connect devices than the IPv4 address space had available. 

Inca Empire<====>15319<====>Inca EmpireThe Inca Empire (Quechua: Tawantinsuyu,   "The Four Regions" ), also known as the Incan Empire and the Inka Empire, was the largest empire in pre-Columbian America,    and possibly the largest empire in the world in the early 16th century.   Its political and administrative structure "was the most sophisticated found among native peoples" in the Americas.   The administrative, political and military center of the empire was located in Cusco in modern-day Peru.  The Inca civilization arose from the highlands of Peru sometime in the early 13th century. 

Inka<====>15320<====>Inka

Internet Protocol<====>15323<====>Internet Protocol The Internet Protocol (IP) is the principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries.  Its routing function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet. IP has the task of delivering packets from the source host to the destination host solely based on the IP addresses in the packet headers.  For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that encapsulate the data to be delivered.   It also defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination information. Historically, IP was the connectionless datagram service in the original Transmission Control Program introduced by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn in 1974; the other being the connection-oriented Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). 

Impeachment<====>15328<====>Impeachment  Impeachment is the process by which a legislative body formally levels charges against a high official of government.  Impeachment does not necessarily mean removal from office; it is only a formal statement of charges, akin to an indictment in criminal law, and is thus only the first step towards removal.  Once an individual is impeached, he or she must then face the possibility of conviction via legislative vote, which then entails the removal of the individual from office. Because impeachment and conviction of officials involve an overturning of the normal constitutional procedures by which individuals achieve high office (election, ratification, or appointment) and because it generally requires a supermajority, they are usually reserved for those deemed to have committed serious abuses of their office. 

Ibizan Hound<====>15334<====>Ibizan HoundThe Ibizan Hound ( ,  ) is a lean, agile dog of the hound family.  There are two hair types of the breed: smooth and wire.  The more commonly seen type is the smooth.  Some consider there to be a third type, long, but the longhair is most likely a variation of the wire. Description AppearanceThe Ibizan Hound is an elegant and agile breed, with an athletic and attractive outline and a ground-covering springy trot.  Though graceful in appearance, it has good bone girth and is a rugged/hardy breed. 

Irish Wolfhound<====>15335<====>Irish Wolfhound  The Irish Wolfhound ( ,  ) is a breed of domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), specifically a very large sighthound from Ireland.  The name originates from its purpose wolf hunting with dogs rather than from its appearance.  Originally developed from war hounds to one used for hunting and guarding, Irish Wolfhounds can be an imposing sight due to their formidable size. HistoryThe breed is very old; there are suggestions it may have been brought to Ireland as early as 7000 BC. These dogs are mentioned, as cú (variously translated as hound, Irish hound, war dog, wolf dog, etc. 

Italian Greyhound<====>15336<====>Italian Greyhound The Italian Greyhound (in Italian: Piccolo Levriero Italiano) is a small breed of dog of the sighthound type, sometimes called an "I. G. ", "Iggy" or an "Italian".  DescriptionThe Italian Greyhound is the smallest  of the sighthounds, typically weighing about   and standing about   tall at the shoulder.   They are in the toy group in the UK and US but in the sighthound group in the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI). The Italian Greyhound's chest is deep, with a tucked up abdomen, long slender legs and a long neck that tapers down to a small head. 

Into the Woods<====>15341<====>Into the Woods  Into the Woods is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by James Lapine.  The musical intertwines the plots of several Brothers Grimm and Charles Perrault fairy tales, exploring the consequences of the characters' wishes and quests.  The main characters are taken from "Little Red Riding Hood",  "Jack and the Beanstalk", "Rapunzel", and "Cinderella", as well as several others.  The musical is tied together by a story involving a childless baker and his wife and their quest to begin a family (the original beginning of The Grimm Brothers' Rapunzel), their interaction with a witch who has placed a curse on them, and their interaction with other storybook characters during their journey. 

Isaac Klein<====>15342<====>Isaac KleinIsaac Klein (September 5, 1905 – 1979) was a prominent rabbi and halakhic authority within Conservative Judaism. Personal life, education, and careerKlein was born in the small village of Várpalánka, today part of Mukachevo, in what was then Hungary.  He emigrated with his family to the United States in 1921.  He earned a BA from City College in New York in 1931.  Although nearing ordination at the Yeshiva University's Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, he transferred to the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA), where he was ordained in 1934 and received the advanced Jewish legal degree of Hattarat Hora’ah under the great talmudic scholar Rabbi Professor Louis Ginzberg. 

Intron<====>15343<====>Intron An intron is any nucleotide sequence within a gene that is removed by RNA splicing during maturation of the final RNA product.   The term intron refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts.    Sequences that are joined together in the final mature RNA after RNA splicing are exons.  Introns are found in the genes of most organisms and many viruses, and can be located in a wide range of genes, including those that generate proteins, ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA). 

Institute of National Remembrance<====>15346<====>Institute of National Remembrance  The Institute of National Remembrance – Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation ( ; IPN) is a Polish government-affiliated research institute with lustration prerogatives,  as well as prosecution powers.   It was created by legislation enacted by the Parliament of Poland.   The Institute specialises in the legal and historical examination of the 20th century history of Poland in particular.  Nauka polska: Instytucje naukowe – identyfikator rekordu: i6575  IPN investigates both Nazi and Communist crimes committed in Poland between 1939 and the Revolutions of 1989, documents its findings and disseminates the results of its investigations to the public. 

Identical particles<====>15352<====>Identical particles  Identical particles, also called indistinguishable or indiscernible particles, are particles that cannot be distinguished from one another, even in principle.  Species of identical particles include, but are not limited to elementary particles such as electrons, composite subatomic particles such as atomic nuclei, as well as atoms and molecules.  Quasiparticles also behave in this way.  Although all known indistinguishable particles are "tiny", there is no exhaustive list of all possible sorts of particles nor a clear-cut limit of applicability, as explored in quantum statistics. There are two main categories of identical particles: bosons, which can share quantum states, and fermions, which do not share quantum states as described by the Pauli exclusion principle. 

Interstitial cystitis<====>15354<====>Interstitial cystitis  Interstitial cystitis (IC), also known as bladder pain syndrome (BPS), is a type of chronic pain that affects the bladder.   Symptoms include feeling the need to urinate right away, needing to urinate often, and pain with sex.   IC/BPS is associated with depression and lower quality of life.Many of those affected also have irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia.The cause of IC/BPS is unknown.   While it can, it does not typically run in a family.   The diagnosis is usually based on the symptoms after ruling out other conditions. 

Imperial Chemical Industries<====>15356<====>Imperial Chemical Industries   Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) was a British chemical company and was, for much of its history, the largest manufacturer in Britain.  It was formed by the merger of leading British chemical companies in 1926. Its headquarters were at Millbank in London, and it was a constituent of the FT 30 and later the FTSE 100 Indexes. ICI made paints and speciality products, including food ingredients, speciality polymers, electronic materials, fragrances and flavourings. It was acquired by AkzoNobel in 2008,   who immediately sold parts of ICI to Henkel, and integrated ICI's remaining operations within its existing organisation. 

Imperial Airways<====>15357<====>Imperial Airways    Imperial Airways was the early British commercial long-range airline, operating from 1924 to 1939 and serving parts of Europe but principally the British Empire routes to South Africa, India and the Far East, including Malaya and Hong Kong.   There were local partnership companies; Qantas in Australia. Imperial Airways was merged into the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) in 1939, which in turn merged with the British European Airways (BEA) in 1974 to form British Airways. BackgroundThe establishment of Imperial Airways occurred in the context of facilitating overseas settlement by making travel to and from the colonies quicker, and that flight would also speed up colonial government and trade that was until then dependent upon ships. 

Insanity defense<====>15358<====>Insanity defense  The insanity defense, also known as the mental disorder defense, is a defense by excuse in a criminal case, arguing that the defendant is not responsible for his or her actions due to an episodic or persistent psychiatric disease at the time of the criminal act. This is contrasted with an excuse of provocation, in which defendant is responsible, but the responsibility is lessened due to a temporary mental state. Criminal Law - Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012, Wolters Kluwer Law & Business; John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder,  , [1]   It is also contrasted with a finding that a defendant cannot stand trial in a criminal case because a mental disease prevents him or her from effectively assisting counsel, from a civil finding in trusts and estates where a will is nullified because it was made when a mental disorder prevented a testator from recognizing the natural objects of their bounty, and from involuntary civil commitment to a mental institution, when a person is found to be gravely disabled or to be a danger to himself or herself or to others.  Exemption from full criminal punishment on such grounds dates back to at least the Code of Hammurabi.  Legal definitions of insanity or mental disorder are varied, and include the M'Naghten Rule, the Durham rule, the 1953 British Royal Commission on Capital Punishment report, the ALI rule (American Legal Institute Model Penal Code rule), and other provisions, often relating to a lack of mens rea ("guilty mind"). In the criminal laws of Australia and Canada, statutory legislation enshrines the M'Naghten Rules, with the terms defense of mental disorder, defense of mental illness or not criminally responsible by reason of mental disorder employed. Being incapable of distinguishing right from wrong is one basis for being found to be legally insane as a criminal defense.  It originated in the M'Naghten Rule, and has been reinterpreted and modernized through more recent cases, such as People v. Serravo.  In the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the United States, use of the defense is rare;    however, since the Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991,  insanity pleas have steadily increased in the UK.   Mitigating factors, including things not eligible for the insanity defense such as intoxication  (or, more frequently, diminished capacity), may lead to reduced charges or reduced sentences.The defense is based on evaluations by forensic mental health professionals with the appropriate test according to the jurisdiction. Their testimony guides the jury, but they are not allowed to testify to the accused's criminal responsibility, as this is a matter for the jury to decide. Similarly, mental health practitioners are restrained from making a judgment on the issue of whether the defendant is or is not insane or what is known as the "ultimate issue".   Some jurisdictions require the evaluation to address the defendant's ability to control their behavior at the time of the offense (the volitional limb). A defendant claiming the defense is pleading "not guilty by reason of insanity" (NGRI) or "guilty but insane or mentally ill" in some jurisdictions which, if successful, may result in the defendant being committed to a psychiatric facility for an indeterminate period.Mitigating factors and diminished capacityThe United States Supreme Court (in Penry v. Lynaugh) and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (in Bigby v. Dretke) have been clear in their decisions that jury instructions in death penalty cases that do not ask about mitigating factors regarding the defendant's mental health violate the defendant's Eighth Amendment rights, saying that the jury is to be instructed to consider mitigating factors when answering unrelated questions. This ruling suggests specific explanations to the jury are necessary to weigh mitigating factors.Diminished responsibility or diminished capacity can be employed as a mitigating factor or partial defense to crimes and, in the United States, is applicable to more circumstances than the insanity defense. The Homicide Act 1957 is the statutory basis for the defense of diminished responsibility in England and Wales, whereas in Scotland it is a product of case law. The number of findings of diminished responsibility has been matched by a fall in unfitness to plead and insanity findings (Walker, 1968). A plea of diminished capacity is different from a plea of insanity in that "reason of insanity" is a full defense while "diminished capacity" is merely a plea to a lesser crime.   Non compos mentisNon compos mentis (Latin) is a legal term meaning "not of sound mind".  Non compos mentis derives from the Latin non meaning "not", compos meaning "having command" or "composed", and mentis (genitive singular of mens), meaning "of mind". It is the direct opposite of Compos mentis (of a sound mind).Although typically used in law, this term can also be used metaphorically or figuratively; e.g. when one is in a confused state, intoxicated, or not of sound mind. The term may be applied when a determination of competency needs to be made by a physician for purposes of obtaining informed consent for treatments and, if necessary, assigning a surrogate to make health care decisions.  While the proper sphere for this determination is in a court of law, this is practically, and most frequently, made by physicians in the clinical setting. In English law, the rule of non compos mentis was most commonly used when the defendant invoked religious or magical explanations for behaviour. Withdrawal or refusal of defenseSeveral cases have ruled that persons found not guilty by reason of insanity may not withdraw the defense in a habeas petition to pursue an alternative, although there have been exceptions in other rulings.  In State v. Connelly, 700 A.2d 694 (Conn. App. Ct. 1997), the petitioner who had originally been found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed for ten years to the jurisdiction of a Psychiatric Security Review Board, filed a pro se writ of habeas corpus and the court vacated his insanity acquittal. He was granted a new trial and found guilty of the original charges, receiving a prison sentence of 40 years. In the landmark case of Frendak v. United States in 1979, the court ruled that the insanity defense cannot be imposed upon an unwilling defendant if an intelligent defendant voluntarily wishes to forgo the defense.   Psychiatric treatments Those found to have been not guilty by reason of mental disorder or insanity are generally then required to undergo psychiatric treatment in a mental institution , except in the case of temporary insanity (see below).   In England and Wales, under the Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act of 1991 (amended by the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act, 2004 to remove the option of a guardianship order), the court can mandate a hospital order, a restriction order (where release from hospital requires the permission of the Home Secretary), a "supervision and treatment" order, or an absolute discharge.   Unlike defendants who are found guilty of a crime, they are not institutionalized for a fixed period, but rather held in the institution until they are determined not to be a threat. Authorities making this decision tend to be cautious, and as a result, defendants can often be institutionalized for longer than they would have been incarcerated in prison.  In Foucha v. Louisiana (1992) the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that a person could not be held "indefinitely".So far, in the United States, those acquitted of a federal offense by reason of insanity have not been able to challenge their psychiatric confinement through a writ of habeas corpus or other remedies. In Archuleta v. Hedrick, 365 F.3d 644 (8th Cir. 2004), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit the court ruled persons found not guilty by reason of insanity and later want to challenge their confinement may not attack their initial successful insanity defense: Incompetency and mental illnessAn important distinction to be made is the difference between competency and criminal responsibility.The issue of competency is whether a defendant is able to adequately assist his attorney in preparing a defense, make informed decisions about trial strategy and whether to plead guilty or accept a plea agreement. This issue is dealt with in UK law as "fitness to plead". Competency largely deals with the defendant's present condition, while criminal responsibility addresses the condition at the time the crime was committed. In the United States, a trial in which the insanity defense is invoked typically involves the testimony of psychiatrists or psychologists who will, as expert witnesses, present opinions on the defendant's state of mind at the time of the offense.Therefore, a person whose mental disorder is not in dispute is determined to be sane if the court decides that despite a "mental illness" the defendant was responsible for the acts committed and will be treated in court as a normal defendant. If the person has a mental illness and it is determined that the mental illness interfered with the person's ability to determine right from wrong (and other associated criteria a jurisdiction may have) and if the person is willing to plead guilty or is proven guilty in a court of law, some jurisdictions have an alternative option known as either a Guilty but Mentally Ill (GBMI) or a Guilty but Insane verdict. The GBMI verdict is available as an alternative to, rather than in lieu of, a "not guilty by reason of insanity" verdict.  Michigan (1975) was the first state to create a GBMI verdict, after two prisoners released after being found NGRI committed violent crimes within a year of release, one raping two women and the other killing his wife. Temporary insanityThe notion of temporary insanity argues that a defendant was insane during the commission of a crime, but they later regained their sanity after the criminal act was carried out. This legal defense is commonly used to defend individuals that have committed crimes of passion.  The defense was first used by U.S. Congressman Daniel Sickles of New York in 1859 after he had killed his wife's lover, Philip Barton Key. The defense was later used commonly during the 1940s and 1950s. Another 19th-century case was that of Charles J. Guiteau, who assassinated President James Garfield in 1881.  Guiteau's Case, 10 F.161 (1882).HistoryThe concept of defense by insanity has existed since ancient Greece and Rome.  However, in colonial America a delusional Dorothy Talbye was hanged in 1638 for murdering her daughter, as at the time Massachusetts's common law made no distinction between insanity (or mental illness) and criminal behavior.  Edward II, under English Common law, declared that a person was insane if their mental capacity was no more than that of a "wild beast" (in the sense of a dumb animal, rather than being frenzied).  The first complete transcript of an insanity trial dates to 1724. It is likely that the insane, like those under 14, were spared trial by ordeal. When trial by jury replaced this, the jury members were expected to find the insane guilty but then refer the case to the King for a Royal Pardon. From 1500 onwards, juries could acquit the insane, and detention required a separate civil procedure (Walker, 1985).  The Criminal Lunatics Act 1800, passed with retrospective effect following the acquittal of James Hadfield, mandated detention at the regent's pleasure (indefinitely) even for those who, although insane at the time of the offence, were now sane. The M'Naghten Rules of 1843 were not a codification or definition of insanity but rather the responses of a panel of judges to hypothetical questions posed by Parliament in the wake of Daniel M'Naghten's acquittal for the homicide of Edward Drummond, whom he mistook for British Prime Minister Robert Peel. The rules define the defense as "at the time of committing the act the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or as not to know that what he was doing was wrong."   The key is that the defendant could not appreciate the nature of his actions during the commission of the crime. M'Naghten's Case, 8 Eng. Rep. 718 (1843).In Ford v. Wainwright 477 U.S. 399 (1986), the US Supreme Court upheld the common law rule that the insane cannot be executed. It further stated that a person under the death penalty is entitled to a competency evaluation and to an evidentiary hearing in court on the question of his competency to be executed.   In Wainwright v. Greenfield, the Court ruled that it was fundamentally unfair for the prosecutor to comment during the court proceedings on the petitioner's silence invoked as a result of a Miranda warning. The prosecutor had argued that the respondent's silence after receiving Miranda warnings was evidence of his sanity.   United States lawIn the United States, variances in the insanity defense between states, and in the federal court system, are attributable to differences with respect to three key issues:Availability: whether the jurisdiction allows a defendant to raise the insanity defense,Definition: when the defense is available, what facts will support a finding of insanity, andBurden of proof: whether the defendant has the duty of proving insanity or the prosecutor has the duty of disproving insanity, and by what standard of proof.AvailabilityIn the United States, a criminal defendant may plead insanity in federal court, and in the state courts of every state except for Idaho, Kansas, Montana, and Utah.However, defendants in states that disallow the insanity defense may still be able to demonstrate that a defendant was not capable of forming intent to commit a crime as a result of mental illness. DefinitionEach state and the federal court system currently uses one of the following "tests" to define insanity for purposes of the insanity defense. Over its decades of use the definition of insanity has been modified by statute, with changes to the availability of the insanity defense, what constitutes legal insanity whether the prosecutor or defendant has the burden of proof, the standard of proof required at trial, trial procedures, and to commitment and release procedures for defendants who have been acquitted based on a finding of insanity.   M'Naghten testThe guidelines for the M'Naghten Rules (1843) 10 C & F 200, state, inter alia, and evaluating the criminal responsibility for defendants claiming to be insane were settled in the British courts in the case of Daniel M'Naghten in 1843. M'Naghten was a Scottish woodcutter who killed the secretary to the prime minister, Edward Drummond, in a botched attempt to assassinate the prime minister himself. M'Naghten apparently believed that the prime minister was the architect of the myriad of personal and financial misfortunes that had befallen him.    During his trial, nine witnesses testified to the fact that he was insane, and the jury acquitted him, finding him "not guilty by reason of insanity." The House of Lords asked the judges of the common law courts to answer five questions on insanity as a criminal defence,   and the formulation that emerged from their review—that a defendant should not be held responsible for his actions only if, as a result of his mental disease or defect, he (i) did not know that his act would be wrong; or (ii) did not understand the nature and quality of his actions—became the basis of the law governing legal responsibility in cases of insanity in England. Under the rules, loss of control because of mental illness was no defense . The M'Naghten rule was embraced with almost no modification by American courts and legislatures for more than 100 years, until the mid-20th century.  M'Naghten's Case, 8 Eng. Rep. 718 (1843).Durham/New Hampshire testThe strict M'Naghten standard for the insanity defense was widely used until the 1950s and the case of Durham v. United States case.  In the Durham case, the court ruled that a defendant is entitled to acquittal if the crime was the product of his mental illness (i.e., crime would not have been committed but for the disease). The test, also called the Product Test, is broader than either the M'Naghten test or the irresistible impulse test. The test has more lenient guidelines for the insanity defense, but it addressed the issue of convicting mentally ill defendants, which was allowed under the M'Naghten Rule.  M'Naghten's Case, 8 Eng.Rep. 718 (1843). However, the Durham standard drew much criticism because of its expansive definition of legal insanity.Model Penal Code testThe Model Penal Code, published by the American Law Institute, provides a standard for legal insanity that serves as a compromise between the strict M'Naghten Rule, the lenient Durham ruling, and the irresistible impulse test. Under the MPC standard, which represents the modern trend, a defendant is not responsible for criminal conduct "if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law." The test thus takes into account both the cognitive and volitional capacity of insanity.Federal courtsAfter the perpetrator of President Reagan's assassination attempt was found not guilty by reason of insanity, Congress passed the Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984.  Under this act, the burden of proof was shifted from the prosecution to the defense and the standard of evidence in federal trials was increased from a preponderance of evidence to clear and convincing evidence.  The ALI test was discarded in favor of a new test that more closely resembled M'Naghten's.  Under this new test only perpetrators suffering from severe mental illnesses at the time of the crime could successfully employ the insanity defense.  The defendant's ability to control himself or herself was no longer a consideration.The Act also curbed the scope of expert psychiatric testimony and adopted stricter procedures regarding the hospitalization and release of those found not guilty by reason of insanity.Guilty but mentally illAs an alternative to the insanity defense, some jurisdictions permit a defendant to plead guilty but mentally ill.  A defendant who is found guilty but mentally ill may be sentenced to mental health treatment, at the conclusion of which the defendant will serve the remainder of his or her sentence in the same manner as any other defendant. Burden of proofIn a majority of states, the burden of proving insanity is placed on the defendant, who must prove insanity by a preponderance of the evidence. In a minority of states, the burden is placed on the prosecution, who must prove sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. In federal court, and in Arizona, the burden is placed on the defendant, who must prove insanity by clear and convincing evidence.   See 18 U.S.C.S. Sec. 17(b); see also A.R.S. Sec. 13-502(C).ControversyThe insanity plea is used in the U.S Criminal Justice System in less than 1% of all criminal cases.  Little is known about the criminal justice system and the mentally ill: Some U.S. states have begun to ban the use of the insanity defense, and in 1994 the Supreme Court denied a petition of certiorari seeking review of a Montana Supreme Court case that upheld Montana's abolition of the defense.  Idaho, Kansas, and Utah have also banned the defense. However, a mentally ill defendant/patient can be found unfit to stand trial in these states. In 2001, the Nevada Supreme Court found that their state's abolition of the defense was unconstitutional as a violation of Federal due process.  In 2006, the Supreme Court decided Clark v. Arizona upheld Arizona's limitations on the insanity defense. In that same ruling, the Court noted "We have never held that the Constitution mandates an insanity defense, nor have we held that the Constitution does not so require."The insanity defense is also complicated because of the underlying differences in philosophy between psychiatrists/psychologists and legal professionals.In the United States, a psychiatrist, psychologist or other mental health professional is often consulted as an expert witness in insanity cases, but the ultimate legal judgment of the defendant's sanity is determined by a jury, not by a psychologist.  In other words, psychologists provide testimony and professional opinion but are not ultimately responsible for answering legal questions. Australian lawIn Australia there are nine law units. All may have varying rules (see [2]). In South Australia, the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) provides that:269C—Mental competenceA person is mentally incompetent to commit an offence if, at the time of the conduct alleged to give rise to the offence, the person is suffering from a mental impairment and, in consequence of the mental impairment—(a) does not know the nature and quality of the conduct; or(b) does not know that the conduct is wrong; or(c) is unable to control the conduct.269H—Mental unfitness to stand trialA person is mentally unfit to stand trial on a charge of an offence if the person's mental processes are so disordered or impaired that the person is—(a) unable to understand, or to respond rationally to, the charge or the allegations on which the charge is based; or(b)  unable to exercise (or to give rational instructions about the exercise of) procedural rights (such as, for example, the right to challenge jurors); or(c)  unable to understand the nature of the proceedings, or to follow the evidence or the course of the proceedings.In Victoria the current defence of mental impairment was introduced in the Crimes (Mental Impairment and Unfitness to be Tried) Act 1997 which replaced the common law defence of insanity and indefinite detention at the governor's pleasure with the following:the accused was suffering from a mental impairment; andthe mental impairment affected the accused so he or she either did not understand the nature and quality of the conduct, or did not know that it was wrong.These requirements are almost identical to the M'Naghten Rules, substituting "mental impairment" for "disease of the mind". In New South Wales, the defence has been renamed the 'Defence of Mental Illness' in Pt4 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. However, definitions of the defence are derived from M'Naghten's case and have not been codified. Whether a particular condition amounts to a disease of the mind is not a medical but a legal question to be decided in accordance with the ordinary rules of interpretation.  This defence is an exception to the Woolmington v DPP (1935)   'golden thread', as the party raising the issue of the defence of mental illness bears the burden of proving this defence on the balance of probabilities See R v Porter. Generally, the defence will raise the issue of insanity. However, the prosecution can raise it in exceptional circumstances: R v Ayoub (1984).  Australian cases have further qualified and explained the M'Naghten Rules. The NSW Supreme Court in held there are two limbs to the M'Naghten Rules, that the accused did not know what he was doing, or that the accused did not appreciate that what he was doing was morally wrong, in both cases the accused must be operating under a 'defect of reason, from a disease of the mind'.  The High Court in R v Porter stated that the condition of the accused’s mind is relevant only at the time of the actus reus. R v Porter [1933] HCA 1 Austlii  In Woodbridge v The Queen the court stated that a symptom indicating a disease of the mind must be prone to recur and be the result of an underlying pathological infirmity.  A ‘defect of reason’ is the inability to think rationally and pertains to incapacity to reason, rather than having unsound ideas or difficulty with such a task.  Examples of disease of the mind include Arteriosclerosis (considered so because the hardening of the arteries affects the mind. See " See also. Canadian lawCriminal Code provisionsThe defence of mental disorder is codified in section 16 of the Criminal Code which states, in part:16. (1) No person is criminally responsible for an act committed or an omission made while suffering from a mental disorder that rendered the person incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of the act or omission or of knowing that it was wrong.  To establish a claim of mental disorder the party raising the issue must show on a balance of probabilities first that the person who committed the act was suffering from a "disease of the mind", and second, that at the time of the offence they were either 1) unable to appreciate the "nature and quality" of the act, or 2) did not know it was "wrong".The meaning of the word "wrong" was determined in the Supreme Court case of R. v. Chaulk [1990] 3 S.C.R. which held that "wrong" was NOT restricted to "legally wrong" but to "morally wrong" as well.Post-verdict conditionsThe current legislative scheme was created by the Parliament of Canada after the previous scheme was found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Swain.  The new provisions also replaced the old insanity defense with the current mental disorder defence. Once a person is found not criminally responsible ("NCR"), he or she will have a hearing by a Review Board within 45 days (90 days if the court extends the delay). A Review Board is established under Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code and is composed of at least three members, a person who is a judge or eligible to be a judge, a psychiatrist and another expert in a relevant field, such as social work, criminology or psychology. Parties at a Review Board hearing are usually the accused, the Crown and the hospital responsible for the supervision or assessment of the accused. A Review Board is responsible for both accused persons found NCR or accused persons found unfit to stand trial on account of mental disorder. A Review Board dealing with an NCR offender must consider two questions: whether the accused is a "significant threat to the safety of the public" and, if so, what the "least onerous and least restrictive" restrictions on the liberty of the accused should be in order to mitigate such a threat. Proceedings before a Review Board are inquisitorial rather than adversarial. Often the Review Board will be active in conducting an inquiry. Where the Review Board is unable to conclude that the accused is a significant threat to the safety of the public, the review board must grant the accused an absolute discharge, an order essentially terminating the jurisdiction of the criminal law over the accused. Otherwise the Review Board must order that the accused be either discharged subject to conditions or detained in a hospital, both subject to conditions. The conditions imposed must be the least onerous and least restrictive necessary to mitigate any danger the accused may pose to others.Since the Review Board is empowered under criminal law powers under s. 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867 the sole justification for its jurisdiction is public safety. Therefore, the nature of the inquiry is the danger the accused may pose to the public safety rather than whether the accused is "cured." For instance, many "sick" accused persons are discharged absolutely on the basis that they are not a danger to the public while many "sane" accused are detained on the basis that they are dangerous. Moreover, the notion of "significant threat to the safety of the public" is a "criminal threat." This means that the Review Board must find that the threat posed by the accused is of a criminal nature.While proceedings before a Review Board are less formal than in court, there are many procedural safe-guards available to the accused given the potential indefinite nature of Part XX.1. Any party may appeal against the decision of a Review Board.In 1992 when the new mental disorder provisions were enacted, Parliament included "capping" provisions which were to be enacted at a later date. These capping provisions limited the jurisdiction of a Review Board over an accused based on the maximum potential sentence had the accused been convicted (e.g. there would be a cap of 5 years if the maximum penalty for the index offence is 5 years). However, these provisions were never proclaimed into force and were subsequently repealed.A Review Board must hold a hearing every 12 months (unless extended to 24 months) until the accused is discharged absolutely.Accused unfit to stand trialThe issue of mental disorder may also come into play before a trial even begins, if the accused's mental state prevents the accused from being able to appreciate the nature of a trial and to conduct a defence.An accused who is found to be unfit to stand trial is subject to the jurisdiction a Review Board. While the considerations are essentially the same, there are a few provisions which apply only to unfit accused. A Review Board must determine whether the accused is fit to stand trial. Regardless of the determination, the Review Board must then determine what conditions should be imposed on the accused, considering both the protection of the public and the maintenance of the fitness of the accused (or conditions which would render the accused fit). Previously an absolute discharge was unavailable to an unfit accused. However, in R. v. Demers, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the provision restricting the availability of an absolute discharge to an accused person who is deemed both "permanently unfit" and not a significant threat to the safety of the public. Presently a Review Board may recommend a judicial stay of proceedings in the event that it finds the accused both "permanently unfit" and non-dangerous. The decision is left to the court having jurisdiction over the accused.An additional requirement for an unfit accused is the holding of a "prima facie case" hearing every two years. The Crown must demonstrate to the court having jurisdiction over the accused that it still has sufficient evidence to try the accused. If the Crown fails to meet this burden then the accused is discharged and proceedings are terminated. The nature of the hearing is virtually identical to that of a preliminary hearing.Scottish lawThe Scottish Law Commission, in its Discussion Paper No 122 on Insanity and Diminished Responsibility (2003),  pp. 16/18, confirms that the law has not substantially changed from the position stated in Hume's Commentaries:We may next attend to the case of those unfortunate persons, who have plead the miserable defense of idiocy or insanity. Which condition, if it is not an assumed or imperfect, but a genuine and thorough insanity, and is proved by the testimony of intelligent witnesses, makes the act like that of an infant, and equally bestows the privilege of an entire exemption from any manner of pain; Cum alterum innocentia concilii tuetur, alterum fati infelicitas excusat. I say, where the insanity is absolute, and is duly proved: For if reason and humanity enforce the plea in these circumstances, it is no less necessary to observe a caution and reserve in applying the law, as shall hinder it from being understood, that there is any privilege in a case of mere weakness of intellect, or a strange and moody humor, or a crazy and capricious or irritable temper. In none of these situations does or can the law excuse the offender. Because such constitutions are not exclusive of a competent understanding of the true state of the circumstances in which the deed is done, nor of the subsistence of some steady and evil passion, grounded in those circumstances, and directed to a certain object. To serve the purpose of a defense in law, the disorder must therefore amount to an absolute alienation of reason, ut continua mentis alienatione, omni intellectu careat - such a disease as deprives the patient of the knowledge of the true aspect and position of things about him - hinders him from distinguishing friend from foe - and gives him up to the impulse of his own distempered fancy.The phrase "absolute alienation of reason" is still regarded as at the core of the defense in the modern law (see HM Advocate v Kidd (1960) JC 61 and Brennan v HM Advocate (1977)Nordic countriesIn the Nordic countries, insanity is not a defense; instead, it is the responsibility of the court system as such to consider whether the accused may have been psychotic or suffering from other severe mental defects when perpetrating the criminal act. This explains why, in Norway, the court considered the sanity of Anders Behring Breivik, even if he himself declared to be sane.Rules differ between Nordic countries.In Sweden, psychotic perpetrators are seen as accountable, but the sanction is to forensic mental care. In Denmark and Norway, psychotic perpetrators are declared guilty, but not punished. Instead of prison, they are sentenced to mandatory treatment. Still, important differences exist between Norway and Denmark.In Norway, §44 of the penal code states specifically that "a person who at the time of the crime was insane or unconscious is not punished".   In Denmark, §16 of the penal code states that "Persons, who, at the time of the act, were irresponsible owing to mental illness or similar conditions orto a pronounced mental deficiency, are not punishable".    This means that in Denmark, 'insanity' is a legal term rather than a medical term and that the court retains the authority to decide whether an accused person is irresponsible or not.    In Finland, punishments can only be administered if the accused is compos mentis, of sound mind; not if the accused is insane (syyntakeeton, literally "unable to guarantee [shoulder the responsibility of] guilt"). Thus, an insane defendant may be found guilty based on the facts and his actions just as a sane defendant, but the insanity will only affect the punishment. The definition of insanity is similar to the M'Naught criterion above: "the accused is insane, if during the act, due to a mental illness, profound mental retardation or a severe disruption of mental health or consciousness, he cannot understand the actual nature of his act or its illegality, or that his ability to control his behavior is critically weakened". If an accused is suspected to be insane, the court must consult the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), which is obliged to place the accused in involuntary commitment if he is found insane. The offender receives no judicial punishment; he becomes a patient under the jurisdiction of THL, and must be released immediately once the conditions of involuntary commitment are no longer fulfilled. Diminished responsibility is also available, resulting in lighter sentences.Usage and success rateThis increased coverage gives the impression that the defense is widely used, but this is not the case. According to an eight-state study, the insanity defense is used in less than 1% of all court cases and, when used, has only a 26% success rate.

Ice age<====>15361<====>Ice age   An ice age is a period of long-term reduction in the temperature of Earth's surface and atmosphere, resulting in the presence or expansion of continental and polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers.  Within a long-term ice age, individual pulses of cold climate are termed "glacial periods" (or alternatively "glacials" or "glaciations" or colloquially as "ice age"), and intermittent warm periods are called "interglacials".  In the terminology of glaciology, ice age implies the presence of extensive ice sheets in both northern and southern hemispheres.   By this definition, we are in an interglacial period—the Holocene—of the ice age. 

Irving Langmuir<====>15362<====>Irving Langmuir  Irving Langmuir(January 31, 1881 – August 16, 1957) was an American chemist and physicist.  He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1932 for his work in surface chemistry. Langmuir's most famous publication is the 1919 article "The Arrangement of Electrons in Atoms and Molecules" in which, building on Gilbert N.  Lewis's cubical atom theory and Walther Kossel's chemical bonding theory, he outlined his "concentric theory of atomic structure".   Langmuir became embroiled in a priority dispute with Lewis over this work; Langmuir's presentation skills were largely responsible for the popularization of the theory, although the credit for the theory itself belongs mostly to Lewis. 

International Association of Travel Agents Network<====>15365<====>International Association of Travel Agents Network The International Airlines Travel Agent Network (IATAN) is an industry association in the USA designed to represent the interests of its member companies.In addition, it (along with the IATA) is the body responsible for the standard international codes for airlines, airports, hotels, cities and car rental firms (for example, the three-digit codes that designate London Heathrow Airport as LHR). These codes provide a method to link international travel network with international suppliers.

Insider trading<====>15368<====>Insider trading Insider trading is the trading of a public company's stock or other securities (such as bonds or stock options) by individuals with access to nonpublic information about the company.  In various countries, some kinds of trading based on insider information is illegal.  This is because it is seen as unfair to other investors who do not have access to the information, as the investor with insider information could potentially make larger profits than a typical investor could make. The authors of one study claim that illegal insider trading raises the cost of capital for securities issuers, thus decreasing overall economic growth. 

International Brigades<====>15369<====>International Brigades  The International Brigades ( ) were paramilitary units set up by the Communist International to assist the Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War.  The organisation existed for two years, from 1936 until 1938.  It is estimated that during the entire war, between 32,000 and 35,000 members served in the International Brigades, including 15,000 who died in combat; however, there were never more than 20,000 brigade members present on the front line at one time.  Thomas (2003), pp.  941–5; Beevor (2006), p.  157.  The headquarters of the brigade was located at the Gran Hotel,  Albacete, Castilla-La Mancha. 

Food irradiation<====>15374<====>Food irradiation Food irradiation is the process of exposing foodstuffs to ionizing radiation.  Ionizing radiation is energy that can be transmitted without direct contact to the source of the energy (radiation) capable of freeing electrons from their atomic bonds (ionization) in the targeted food.  anon. , Food Irradiation – A technique for preserving and improving the safety of food, WHO, Geneva, 1991   This treatment is used to preserve food, reduce the risk of food borne illness, prevent the spread of invasive pests, and delay or eliminate sprouting or ripening.  Irradiated food does not become radioactive.  The radiation can be emitted by a radioactive substance or generated electrically. 

Copper IUDs<====>15378<====>Copper IUDs   Intrauterine device (IUD) with copper also known as intrauterine coil, is a type of intrauterine device which contains copper.   It is used for birth control and emergency contraception within five days of unprotected sex.It is one of the most effective forms of birth control with a one-year failure rate around 0. 7%.   The device is placed in the uterus and lasts three to ten years.    It may be used by women of all ages regardless of whether or not they have had children.   Following removal, fertility quickly returns. 

Isle Royale National Park<====>15379<====>Isle Royale National Park  Isle Royale National Park is a U. S.  National Park on Isle Royale and adjacent islands in Lake Superior, in the state of Michigan.  Isle Royale National Park was established on April 3, 1940; designated as a National Wilderness Area in 1976; and made an International Biosphere Reserve in 1980.  The park covers  , with   above water.  At the Canada–U. S.  border, it meets the borders of the Canadian Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area. Geography Isle Royale, the largest island in Lake Superior, is over   in length and   wide at its widest point. 

NATO Integrated Air Defense System<====>15381<====>NATO Integrated Air Defense SystemNATO Integrated Air Defense System (short: NATINADS) is according to the German army regulation   100/900 defined as – «A command and control compound (structure or system) of the alliance´s air defence forces, subordinated to the NATO command authorities, already in peace time as well as in crisis and war». DevelopmentDevelopment was approved by the NATO Military Committee in December 1955.  The system was to be based on four air defense regions (ADRs) coordinated by SACEUR (Supreme Allied Commander Europe).  Starting from 1956 early warning coverage was extended across Western Europe using 18 radar stations. 

Invisible balance<====>15382<====>Invisible balance The invisible balance or balance of trade on services is that part of the balance of trade that refers to services and other products that do not result in the transfer of physical objects.  Examples include consulting services, shipping services, tourism, and patent license revenues.  This figure is usually generated by tertiary industry.  The term 'invisible balance' is especially common in the United Kingdom. For countries that rely on service exports or on tourism, the invisible balance is particularly important.  For instance the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia receive significant international income from financial services, while Japan and Germany rely more on exports of manufactured goods. 

Irreducible complexity<====>15387<====>Irreducible complexity  Irreducible complexity (IC) is the idea that certain biological systems cannot evolve by successive small modifications to pre-existing functional systems through natural selection.  Irreducible complexity is central to the creationist concept of intelligent design, but it is rejected by the scientific community, "We therefore find that Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large. "    which regards intelligent design as pseudoscience.   Irreducible complexity is one of two main arguments used by intelligent design proponents, the other being specified complexity. 

Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia<====>15388<====>Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia was a mix of polytheism, Christianity, Judaism, and Iranian religions.  Arab polytheism, the dominant form of religion in pre-Islamic Arabia, was based on veneration of deities and other rituals.  Gods and goddesses, including Hubal and the goddesses al-Lāt, Al-‘Uzzá and Manāt, were worshipped at local shrines, such as the Kaaba in Mecca.  Different theories have been proposed regarding the role of Allah in Meccan religion.Many of the physical descriptions of the pre-Islamic gods are traced to idols, especially near the Kaaba, which is said to have contained up to 360 of them. 

Imperial Conference<====>15392<====>Imperial Conference   Imperial Conferences (Colonial Conferences before 1907) were periodic gatherings of government leaders from the self-governing colonies and dominions of the British Empire between 1887 and 1937, before the establishment of regular Meetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in 1944.  They were held in 1887, 1894, 1897, 1902, 1907, 1911, 1921, 1923, 1926, 1930, 1932 and 1937. All the conferences were held in London, the United Kingdom, the seat of the Empire, except for the 1894 and 1932 conferences which were held in Ottawa, the capital of the senior Dominion of the Crown.   The 1907 conference changed the name of the meetings to Imperial Conferences and agreed that the meetings should henceforth be regular rather than taking place while overseas statesmen were visiting London for royal occasions (e. 

International Refugee Organization<====>15395<====>International Refugee Organization    The International Refugee Organization (IRO) was an intergovernmental organization founded on 20 April 1946 to deal with the massive refugee problem created by World War II.  A Preparatory Commission began operations fourteen months previously.  In 1948, the treaty establishing the IRO formally entered into force and the IRO became a United Nations specialized agency.  The IRO assumed most of the functions of the earlier United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.  In 1952, operations of the IRO ceased, and it was replaced by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). 

Isabella d'Este<====>15401<====>Isabella d'Este   Isabella d'Este (19 May 1474 – 13 February 1539) was Marchesa of Mantua and one of the leading women of the Italian Renaissance as a major cultural and political figure.  She was a patron of the arts  as well as a leader of fashion, whose innovative style of dressing was copied by women throughout Italy and at the French court.   The poet Ariosto labeled her as the "liberal and magnanimous Isabella",  while author Matteo Bandello described her as having been "supreme among women".  Marek, p. ix  Diplomat Niccolò da Correggio went even further by hailing her as "The First Lady of the world". 

International standard<====>15402<====>International standard International standards are standards developed by international standards organizations.  International standards are available for consideration and use worldwide.  The most prominent organization is the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). PurposeInternational standards may be used either by direct application or by a process of modifying an international standard to suit local conditions.  The adoption of international standards results in the creation of equivalent, national standards that are substantially the same as international standards in technical content, but may have (i) editorial differences as to appearance, use of symbols and measurement units, substitution of a point for a comma as the decimal marker, and (ii) differences resulting from conflicts in governmental regulations or industry-specific requirements caused by fundamental climatic, geographical, technological, or infrastructural factors, or the stringency of safety requirements that a given standard authority considers appropriate. 

ISO 4217<====>15403<====>ISO 4217  ISO 4217 is a standard first published by International Organization for Standardization in 1978, which delineates currency designators, country codes (alpha and numeric), and references to minor units in three tables:Table A. 1 – Current currency & funds code list Table A. 2 – Current funds codes Table A. 3 – List of codes for historic denominations of currencies & funds The tables, history and ongoing discussion are maintained by SIX Interbank Clearing on behalf of ISO and the Swiss Association for Standardization.  The ISO 4217 code list is used in banking and business globally.  In many countries the ISO codes for the more common currencies are so well known publicly that exchange rates published in newspapers or posted in banks use only these to delineate the different currencies, instead of translated currency names or ambiguous currency symbols. 

Irgun<====>15406<====>Irgun  The Irgun ( ; full title:    , lit.  "The National Military Organization in the Land of Israel") was a Zionist paramilitary organization that operated in Mandate Palestine between 1931 and 1948.  It was an offshoot of the older and larger Jewish paramilitary organization Haganah (Hebrew:  , Defence).  When the group broke from the Haganah it became known as the Haganah Bet (Hebrew: literally "Defense 'B' " or "Second Defense",  ), or alternatively as haHaganah haLeumit ( ) or Hama'amad ( ).   Irgun members were absorbed into the Israel Defense Forces at the start of the 1948 Arab–Israeli war. 

Isoroku Yamamoto<====>15408<====>Isoroku Yamamoto was a Japanese Marshal Admiral of the Navy and the commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet during World War II until his death. Yamamoto held several important posts in the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), and undertook many of its changes and reorganizations, especially its development of naval aviation.  He was the commander-in-chief during the decisive early years of the Pacific War and therefore responsible for major battles, such as Pearl Harbor and Midway.  He died when American code breakers identified his flight plans and his plane was shot down.  His death was a major blow to Japanese military morale during World War II. 

Infrared spectroscopy<====>15412<====>Infrared spectroscopy Infrared spectroscopy (IR spectroscopy or vibrational spectroscopy) involves the interaction of infrared radiation with matter.  It covers a range of techniques, mostly based on absorption spectroscopy.  As with all spectroscopic techniques, it can be used to identify and study chemicals.  Samples may be solid, liquid, or gas.  The method or technique of infrared spectroscopy is conducted with an instrument called an infrared spectrometer (or spectrophotometer) to produce an infrared spectrum.   An IR spectrum can be visualized in a graph of infrared light absorbance (or transmittance) on the vertical axis vs.  frequency or wavelength on the horizontal axis. 

Irenaeus<====>15414<====>Irenaeus  Irenaeus ( ; Greek:   Eirēnaíos) (died about 202) was a Greek cleric noted for his role in guiding and expanding Christian communities in what is now the south of France and, more widely, for the development of Christian theology by combatting heresy and defining orthodoxy.  Originating from Smyrna, now Izmir in Turkey, he had heard the preaching of Polycarp,  who in turn was said to have heard John the Evangelist.  Chosen as bishop of Lugdunum, now Lyon, his best-known work is On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis, often cited as Adversus Haereses, an attack on gnosticism, in particular that of Valentinus. 

Involuntary commitment<====>15416<====>Involuntary commitment Involuntary commitment or civil commitment (also known informally as sectioning or being sectioned  in some jurisdictions, such as the UK)  is a legal process through which an individual who is deemed by a qualified agent to have symptoms of severe mental disorder is court-ordered into treatment in a psychiatric hospital (inpatient) or in the community (outpatient). Criteria for civil commitment are established by laws, which vary between nations.  Commitment proceedings often follow a period of emergency hospitalization, during which an individual with acute psychiatric symptoms is confined for a relatively short duration (e. g.  72 hours) in a treatment facility for evaluation and stabilization by mental health professionals—who may then determine whether further civil commitment is appropriate or necessary. 

Intermolecular force<====>15417<====>Intermolecular forceIntermolecular forces (IMFs) are the forces which mediate interaction between molecules, including forces of attraction or repulsion which act between molecules and other types of neighboring particles, e. g. , atoms or ions.  Inter-molecular forces are weak relative to intramolecular forces – the forces which hold a molecule together.  For example, the covalent bond, involving sharing electron pairs between atoms, is much stronger than the forces present between neighboring molecules.  Both sets of forces are essential parts of force fields frequently used in molecular mechanics. The investigation of inter-molecular forces starts from macroscopic observations which indicate the existence and action of forces at a molecular level. 

List of Internet top-level domains<====>15422<====>List of Internet top-level domains  This list of Internet top-level domain extensions contains top-level domains, which are those domains in the DNS root zone of the Domain Name System of the Internet.  The official list of all top-level domains is maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) at the Root Zone Database.    IANA also oversees the approval process for new proposed top-level domains.   , the root domain contains 1528 top-level domains,  while a few have been retired and are no longer functional. Types IANA distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains: infrastructure top-level domain (ARPA)generic top-level domains (gTLD)restricted generic top-level domains (grTLD)sponsored top-level domains (sTLD)country code top-level domains (ccTLD)test top-level domains (tTLD)Original top-level domainsSeven generic top-level domains were created early in the development of the Internet, and predate the creation of ICANN in 1998. 

Idealism<====>15428<====>Idealism In philosophy, idealism is the group of metaphysical philosophies which assert that reality, or reality as humans can know it, is fundamentally mental, mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial.  Epistemologically, idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In contrast to materialism, idealism asserts the primacy of consciousness as the origin and prerequisite of material phenomena.  According to this view consciousness exists before and is the pre-condition of material existence.  Consciousness creates and determines the material and not vice versa.  Idealism believes consciousness and mind to be the origin of the material world and aims to explain the existing world according to these principles. 

Inheritance<====>15430<====>Inheritance  Inheritance is the practice of passing on property, titles, debts, rights, and obligations upon the death of an individual.  The rules of inheritance differ between societies and have changed over time. TerminologyIn law, an heir is a person who is entitled to receive a share of the deceased's (the person who died) property, subject to the rules of inheritance in the jurisdiction of which the deceased was a citizen or where the deceased (decedent) died or owned property at the time of death. The inheritance may be either under the terms of a will or by intestate laws if the deceased had no will. 

Ignatius of Antioch<====>15435<====>Ignatius of Antioch Ignatius of Antioch (ancient Greek: Ἰγνάτιος Ἀντιοχείας, Ignátios Antiokheías) (c.  35  – c.  107)   , also known as Ignatius Theophorus ( , Ignátios ho Theophóros,  lit.   "the God-bearing"), Ignatius Nurono ( lit.   "The fire-bearer") was an early Christian writer and bishop of Antioch.  En route to Rome, where he met his martyrdom, Ignatius wrote a series of letters.  This correspondence now forms a central part of the later collection known as the Apostolic Fathers.  His letters also serve as an example of early Christian theology.  Important topics they address include ecclesiology, the sacraments, and the role of bishops. 

ITU prefix<====>15437<====>ITU prefix The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) allocates call sign prefixes for radio and television stations of all types.  They also form the basis for, but do not exactly match, aircraft registration identifiers.  These prefixes are agreed upon internationally, and are a form of country code.   A call sign can be any number of letters and numerals but each country must only use call signs that begin with the characters allocated for use in that country. A few countries do not fully comply with these rules.   Australian broadcast stations officially have—but do not use—the VL prefix, and Canada uses Chile's CB for its own Canadian Broadcasting Corporation stations. 

IBM PC keyboard<====>15440<====>IBM PC keyboard The keyboards for IBM PC-compatible computers are standardized.  However, during the more than 30 years of PC architecture being constantly updated, multiple types of keyboard layout variations have been developed. A well-known class of IBM PC keyboards is the Model M.  Introduced in 1986 and manufactured by IBM, Lexmark, Maxi-Switch and Unicomp, the vast majority of Model M keyboards feature a buckling spring key design and many have fully swappable keycaps. Keyboard layoutsThe PC keyboard changed over the years, often at the launch of new IBM PC versions. Name  Keys  Description  Image Model F (PC/XT)  83 Original left-hand side function key (F key) columns, F1 through F10; electronically incompatible with PC/AT keyboard types  Introduced with original IBM PC August 1981. 

Italian battleship Giulio Cesare<====>15441<====>Italian battleship Giulio Cesare  } Giulio Cesare was one of three   dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) in the 1910s.  She served in both World Wars, although she was little used and saw no combat during the former.  The ship supported operations during the Corfu Incident in 1923 and spent much of the rest of the decade in reserve.  She was rebuilt between 1933 and 1937 with more powerful guns, additional armor and considerably more speed than before. Both Giulio Cesare and her sister ship,  , participated in the Battle of Calabria in July 1940, when the former was lightly damaged. 

INS Vikrant (R11)<====>15442<====>INS Vikrant (R11)    }    INS Vikrant (from Sanskrit vikrānta, "courageous") was a   of the Indian Navy.  The ship was laid down as HMS Hercules for the British Royal Navy during World War II, but construction was put on hold when the war ended.  India purchased the incomplete carrier in 1957, and construction was completed in 1961.  Vikrant was commissioned as the first aircraft carrier of the Indian Navy and played a key role in enforcing the naval blockade of East Pakistan during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. In its later years, the ship underwent major refits to embark modern aircraft, before being decommissioned in January 1997. 

Western imperialism in Asia<====>15443<====>Western imperialism in Asia  Western imperialism in Asia as presented in this article pertains to Western European entry into what was first called the East Indies.  This was sparked early in the 15th century by the search for trade routes to China that led directly to the Age of Discovery, and the introduction of early modern warfare into what was then called the Far East.  By the early 16th century the Age of Sail greatly expanded Western European influence and development of the Spice Trade under colonialism.  There has been a presence of Western European colonial empires and imperialism in Asia throughout six centuries of colonialism, formally ending with the independence of the Portuguese Empire's last colony East Timor in 2002. 

Entropy (information theory)<====>15445<====>Entropy (information theory)  Information entropy is defined as the average amount of information produced by a stochastic source of data. The measure of information entropy associated with each possible data value is the negative logarithm of the probability mass function for the value.  Thus, when the data source has a lower-probability value (i. e. , when a low-probability event occurs), the event carries more "information" ("surprisal") than when the source data has a higher-probability value.  The amount of information conveyed by each event defined in this way becomes a random variable whose expected value is the information entropy. 

Ithaca College<====>15446<====>Ithaca College Ithaca College is a private, nonsectarian, coeducational liberal arts college located on the South Hill of Ithaca, New York, United States.  The college was founded by William Egbert in 1892 as a conservatory of music and is set against the backdrop of the city of Ithaca, Cayuga Lake, waterfalls, and gorges.  The college is best known for its large list of alumni who have played substantial roles in the media and entertainment industries. Ithaca College is internationally known for the Roy H.  Park School of Communications, which is ranked by several organizations as a top school for journalism, film, media and entertainment. 

Differential psychology<====>15447<====>Differential psychology  Differential psychology studies the ways in which individuals differ in their behavior and the processes that underlie it.  This is distinguished from other aspects of psychology in that although psychology is ostensibly a study of individuals, modern psychologists often study groups, or attempt to discover general psychological processes that apply to all individuals. For example, in evaluating the effectiveness of a new therapy, the mean performance of the therapy in one treatment group might be compared to the mean effectiveness of a placebo (or a well-known therapy) in a second, control group.  In this context, differences between individuals in their reaction to the experimental and control manipulations are actually treated as errors rather than as interesting phenomena to study. 

Industrial and organizational psychology<====>15450<====>Industrial and organizational psychology Industrial and organizational psychology (I/O psychology), which is also known as occupational psychology, organizational psychology, and work and organizational psychology, is an applied discipline within psychology.  I/O psychology is the science of human behaviour relating to work and applies psychological theories and principles to organizations and individuals in their places of work as well as the individual's work-life more generally.   I/O psychologists are trained in the scientist–practitioner model.  They contribute to an organization's success by improving the performance, motivation, job satisfaction, and occupational safety and health as well as the overall health and well-being of its employees. 

International Council of Unitarians and Universalists<====>15451<====>International Council of Unitarians and Universalists  The International Council of Unitarians and Universalists (ICUU) is an umbrella organization founded in 1995 bringing together many Unitarian, Universalist, and Unitarian Universalist organizations.  The size of the affiliated organizations varies widely.  Some groups represent only a few hundred people; while the largest, the Unitarian Universalist Association, has over 160,000 membersand is larger than all the other groups put together.  HistoryThe original initiative for its establishment was contained in a resolution of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches (British Unitarians) in 1987. 

Itanium<====>15454<====>Itanium   Itanium (   ) is a family of 64-bit Intel microprocessors that implement the Intel Itanium architecture (formerly called IA-64).  Intel markets the processors for enterprise servers and high-performance computing systems.  The Itanium architecture originated at Hewlett-Packard (HP), and was later jointly developed by HP and Intel. Itanium-based systems have been produced by HP (the HP Integrity Servers line) and several other manufacturers.  In 2008, Itanium was the fourth-most deployed microprocessor architecture for enterprise-class systems, behind x86-64, Power Architecture, and SPARC.In February 2017, Intel released the current generation, Kittson, to test customers, and in May began shipping in volume. 

International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems<====>15459<====>International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the international "standard diagnostic tool for epidemiology, health management and clinical purposes".  Its full official name is International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems.  The ICD is maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO), the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations System.   The ICD is designed as a health care classification system, providing a system of diagnostic codes for classifying diseases, including nuanced classifications of a wide variety of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or disease. 

Integral domain<====>15462<====>Integral domain In mathematics, and specifically in abstract algebra, an integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which the product of any two nonzero elements is nonzero.    Integral domains are generalizations of the ring of integers and provide a natural setting for studying divisibility. In an integral domain, every nonzero element a has the cancellation property, that is, if  , an equality   implies  . "Integral domain" is defined almost universally as above, but there is some variation.  This article follows the convention that rings have a multiplicative identity, generally denoted 1, but some authors do not follow this, by not requiring integral domains to have a multiplicative identity. 

Interrupt latency<====>15467<====>Interrupt latency  In computing, interrupt latency is the time that elapses from when an interrupt is generated to when the source of the interrupt is serviced.  For many operating systems, devices are serviced as soon as the device's interrupt handler is executed.  Interrupt latency may be affected by microprocessor design, interrupt controllers, interrupt masking, and the operating system's (OS) interrupt handling methods. BackgroundThere is usually a trade-off between interrupt latency, throughput, and processor utilization.  Many of the techniques of CPU and OS design that improve interrupt latency will decrease throughput and increase processor utilization.  Techniques that increase throughput may increase interrupt latency and increase processor utilization. 

İskender kebap<====>15468<====>İskender kebap  İskender kebap (Alexander Kebab) is one of the most famous meat foods of northwestern Turkey and takes its name from its inventor, İskender Efendi, who lived in Bursa in the late 19th century. It is a kind of döner kebab prepared from thinly cut grilled lamb basted with hot tomato sauce over pieces of pita bread and generously slathered with melted sheep butter and yogurt.  Additionally, one cylindrical köfte can be placed on top.  It is commonly consumed with şıra as a drink to aid digestion.  Tomato sauce and melted butter are generally poured over the dish, at the table. 

LGBT in Islam<====>15471<====>LGBT in IslamLGBT in Islam is influenced by the religious, legal, social, and cultural history of the nations with a sizable Muslim population, along with specific passages in the Quran  and hadith, statements attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The Qur'an cites the story of the "people of Lot" destroyed by the wrath of God because they engaged in lustful carnal acts between men.  Homosexual acts are forbidden in traditional Islamic jurisprudence and are liable to different punishments, including the death penalty, depending on the situation and legal school.  However, homosexual relationships were generally tolerated in pre-modern Islamic societies,   and historical record suggests that these laws were invoked infrequently, mainly in cases of rape or other "exceptionally blatant infringement on public morals". 

Infanticide<====>15474<====>Infanticide  Infanticide (or infant homicide) is the intentional killing of infants. Parental infanticide researchers have found that mothers are far more likely than fathers to be the perpetrator for neonaticide  and slightly more likely to commit infanticide in general.  In many past societies, certain forms of infanticide were considered permissible.  In India female infanticide is more common than the killing of male offspring, due to sex-selective infanticide.   In China for example, the sex gap between males and females aged 0–19 years old was estimated to be 25 million in 2010 by the United Nations Population Fund. 

Internet protocol suite<====>15476<====>Internet protocol suite  The Internet protocol suite is the conceptual model and set of communications protocols used on the Internet and similar computer networks.  It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).  It is occasionally known as the Department of Defense (DoD) model, because the development of the networking method was funded by the United States Department of Defense through DARPA. The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received.  This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers which classify all related protocols according to the scope of networking involved. 

Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi<====>15477<====>Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi  Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi ( ;  ALFB transliteration:  Ḁbnʋ ălŞɑỉƈ alLibi; born Ali Mohamed Abdul Aziz al-Fakheri, 1963 – May 10, 2009) was a Libyan national captured in Afghanistan in November 2001 after the fall of the Taliban; he was interrogated by the American and Egyptian forces.  The information he gave under torture to Egyptian authorities   was cited by the George W.  Bush Administration in the months preceding its 2003 invasion of Iraq as evidence of a connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda.   That information was frequently repeated by members of the Bush Administration, although reports from both the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) strongly questioned its credibility, suggesting that al-Libi was "intentionally misleading" interrogators. 

International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement<====>15487<====>International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement   The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is an international humanitarian movement with approximately 97 million volunteers, members and staff worldwide    which was founded to protect human life and health, to ensure respect for all human beings, and to prevent and alleviate human suffering. The movement consists of several distinct organizations that are legally independent from each other, but are united within the movement through common basic principles, objectives, symbols, statutes and governing organisations.  The movement's parts are:The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is a private humanitarian institution founded in 1863 in Geneva, Switzerland, by Henry Dunant and Gustave Moynier. 

Ira Gershwin<====>15489<====>Ira Gershwin  Ira Gershwin (6 December 1896  17 August 1983) was an American lyricist who collaborated with his younger brother, composer George Gershwin, to create some of the most memorable songs of the 20th century.  With George he wrote more than a dozen Broadway shows, featuring songs such as "I Got Rhythm", "Embraceable You", "The Man I Love" and "Someone to Watch Over Me".  He was also responsible, along with DuBose Heyward, for the libretto to George's opera Porgy and Bess. The success the Gershwin brothers had with their collaborative works has often overshadowed the creative role that Ira played. 

Indus River<====>15490<====>Indus RiverThe Indus River (also called the Sindhū or Abāsīn) is one of the longest rivers in Asia.  It flows through China (western Tibet), India (Jammu and Kashmir) and Pakistan.   Originating in the Tibetan Plateau in the vicinity of Lake Mansarovar, the river runs a course through the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir, towards Gilgit and Baltistan and then flows in a southerly direction along the entire length of Pakistan to merge into the Arabian Sea near the port city of Karachi in Sindh.   It is the longest river and national river of Pakistan. 

Integer factorization<====>15491<====>Integer factorization  In number theory, integer factorization is the decomposition of a composite number into a product of smaller integers.  If these integers are further restricted to prime numbers, the process is called prime factorization. When the numbers are sufficiently large, no efficient, non-quantum integer factorization algorithm is known.  An effort by several researchers, concluded in 2009, to factor a 232-digit number (RSA-768) utilizing hundreds of machines took two years and the researchers estimated that a 1024-bit RSA modulus would take about a thousand times as long.However, it has not been proven that no efficient algorithm exists. 

Imperial units<====>15492<====>Imperial units The system of imperial units or the imperial system (also known as British Imperial    or Exchequer Standards of 1825) is the system of units first defined in the British Weights and Measures Act of 1824, which was later refined and reduced.  The Imperial units replaced the Winchester Standards, which were in effect from  1588 to 1825.   The system came into official use across the British Empire.  By the late 20th century, most nations of the former empire had officially adopted the metric system as their main system of measurement, although some imperial units are still used in the United Kingdom, Canada and other countries formerly part of the British Empire. 

Incompatible-properties argument<====>15494<====>Incompatible-properties argument  The incompatible-properties argument is the idea that no description of God is consistent with reality.   For example, if one takes the definition of God to be described fully from the Bible, then the claims of what properties God has described therein might be argued to lead to a contradiction. Evil vs.  good and omnipotenceThe problem of evil is the argument that the existence of evil is incompatible with the concept of an omnipotent and perfectly good God. A variation does not depend on the existence of evil.   A truly omnipotent God could create all possible worlds. 

International Society of Olympic Historians<====>15495<====>International Society of Olympic Historians The International Society of Olympic Historians (ISOH) is a non-profit organization founded in 1991 with the purpose of promoting and studying the Olympic Movement and the Olympic Games.  The majority of recent books on the Olympic Games have been written by ISOH members.   The ISOH publishes the  Journal of Olympic History (JOH, formerly Citius, Altius, Fortius) three times a year. HistoryThe International Society of Olympic Historians (ISOH) was formed as the result of a meeting in London, England in December 1991.  The idea of forming an Olympic historical society had been the subject of correspondence – mainly between Bill Mallon (United States) and Ture Widlund (Sweden) – for many years.

It has been operating for over eighty years since the 1929–30 season.  It had been organized by Lega Calcio until 2010, when the Lega Serie A was created for the 2010–11 season. Serie A is regarded as one of the best football leagues in the world and it is often depicted as the most tactical national league. 

Inhalant<====>15501<====>Inhalant    Inhalants are a broad range of household and industrial chemicals whose volatile vapors or pressurized gases are concentrated and breathed in via the nose or mouth to produce intoxication (called "getting high" in slang), in a manner not intended by the manufacturer.   They are inhaled at room temperature through volatilization (in the case of gasoline or acetone) or from a pressurized container (e. g. , nitrous oxide or butane), and do not include drugs that are sniffed after burning or heating.  For example, amyl nitrite (poppers), nitrous oxide and toluene – a solvent widely used in contact cement and model airplane glue – are considered inhalants, but smoking tobacco, cannabis, and crack are not, even though these drugs are  inhaled (as smoke).

Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in The X-Men #1 (September 1963). Iceman is a member of a subspecies of humans known as mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities.  He has the ability to manipulate ice and cold by freezing water vapor around him.  This allows him to freeze objects, as well as turn his body into ice. The character has been frequently present in X-Men and Spider-Man-related comics, video games, animated series, and movies. 

Isidore of Seville<====>15506<====>Isidore of Seville   Saint Isidore of Seville ( ; c.  560 – 4 April 636), a scholar and, for over three decades, Archbishop of Seville, is widely regarded as the last of the Fathers of the Church, as the 19th-century historian Montalembert put it in an oft-quoted phrase, "The last scholar of the ancient world. "   At a time of disintegration of classical culture,  and aristocratic violence and illiteracy, he was involved in the conversion of the Arian Visigothic kings to Catholicism, both assisting his brother Leander of Seville, and continuing after his brother's death.  He was influential in the inner circle of Sisebut, Visigothic king of Hispania. 

Compounds of carbon<====>15507<====>Compounds of carbonCompounds of carbon are defined as chemical substances containing carbon.    More compounds of carbon exist than any other chemical element except for hydrogen.  Organic carbon compounds are far more numerous than inorganic carbon compounds.  In general bonds of carbon with other elements are covalent bonds.  Carbon is tetravalent but carbon free radicals and carbenes occur as short-lived intermediates.  Ions of carbon are carbocations and carbanions are also short-lived.  An important carbon property is catenation as the ability to form long carbon chains and rings.  Allotropes of carbon The known inorganic chemistry of the allotropes of carbon (diamond, graphite, and the fullerenes) blossomed with the discovery of buckminsterfullerene in 1985, as additional fullerenes and their various derivatives were discovered. 

Industrial espionage<====>15508<====>Industrial espionage Industrial espionage, economic espionage, corporate spying or corporate espionage is a form of espionage conducted for commercial purposes instead of purely national security.    Economic espionage is conducted or orchestrated by governments and is international in scope, while industrial or corporate espionage is more often national and occurs between companies or corporations.  Competitive intelligence and economic or industrial espionage"Competitive intelligence" describes the legal and ethical activity of systematically gathering, analyzing and managing information on industrial competitors.    It may include activities such as examining newspaper articles, corporate publications, websites, patent filings, specialised databases, information at trade shows and the like to determine information on a corporation.

Before that epoch, the Brahmi numeral system was in use; that system did not encompass the concept of the place-value of numbers. Instead, Brahmi numerals included additional symbols for the tens, as well as separate symbols for hundred and thousand.The Indian place-system numerals  spread to neighboring Persia, where they were picked up by the conquering Arabs. In 662, Severus Sebokht - a Nestorian bishop living in Syria wrote: I will omit all discussion of the science of the Indians ...  of their subtle discoveries in astronomy — discoveries that are more ingenious than those of the Greeks and the Babylonians - and of their valuable methods of calculation which surpass description. I wish only to say that this computation is done by means of nine signs. If those who believe that because they speak Greek they have arrived at the limits of science would read the Indian texts they would be convinced even if a little late in the day that there are others who know something of value.  The addition of zero as a tenth positional digit is documented from the 7th century by Brahmagupta, though the earlier Bakhshali Manuscript, written sometime before the 5th century, also included zero. But it is in Khmer numerals of modern Cambodia where the first extant material evidence of zero as a numerical figure, dating its use back to the seventh century, is found. As it was from the Arabs that the Europeans learned this system, the Europeans called them Arabic numerals; the Arabs refer to their numerals as Indian numerals. In academic circles they are called the Hindu–Arabic or Indo–Arabic numerals.The significance of the development of the positional number system is probably best described by the French mathematician Pierre Simon Laplace (1749–1827) who wrote: It is India that gave us the ingenious method of expressing all numbers by the means of ten symbols, each symbol receiving a value of position, as well as an absolute value; a profound and important idea which appears so simple to us now that we ignore its true merit, but its very simplicity, the great ease which it has lent to all computations, puts our arithmetic in the first rank of useful inventions, and we shall appreciate the grandeur of this achievement when we remember that it escaped the genius of Archimedes and Apollonius, two of the greatest minds produced by antiquity. Tobias Dantzig  had this to say in Number:   This long period of nearly five thousand years saw the rise and fall of many civilizations, each leaving behind a heritage of literature, art, philosophy, and religion. But what was the net achievement in the field of reckoning, the earliest art practiced by man? An inflexible numeration so crude as to make progress well nigh impossible, and a calculating device so limited in scope that even elementary calculations called for the services of an expert. [...] man used these devices for thousands of years [...] without contributing a single important idea to the system!   [...] even when compared with the slow growth of ideas during the Dark Ages, the history of reckoning presents a peculiar picture of desolate stagnation.   When viewed in this light, the achievements of the unknown Hindu, who some time in the first centuries of our era discovered the principle of position assumes the importance of a world event.

An airport consists of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off or a helipad, and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, hangars and terminals. An airport with a helipad for rotorcraft but no runway is called a heliport.  An airport for use by seaplanes and amphibious aircraft is called a seaplane base. 

Inclusion body myositis<====>15538<====>Inclusion body myositis  Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is an inflammatory muscle disease characterized by slowly progressive weakness and wasting of both distal and proximal muscles, most apparent in the muscles of the arms and legs.   There are two types: sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM), which is more common, and hereditary inclusion body myopathy (hIBM).  In sporadic inclusion body myositis [MY-oh-sigh-tis], two processes, one autoimmune and the other degenerative, appear to occur in the muscle cells in parallel.  The inflammation aspect is characterized by the cloning of T cells that appear to be driven by specific antigens to invade muscle fibers. 

Ion implantation<====>15539<====>Ion implantation Ion implantation is low-temperature process by which ions of one element are accelerated into a solid target, thereby changing the physical, chemical, or electrical properties of the target.  Ion implantation is used in semiconductor device fabrication and in metal finishing, as well as in materials science research.  The ions can alter the elemental composition of the target (if the ions differ in composition from the target) if they stop and remain in the target.   Ion implantation cause also chemical and physical changes when the ions impinge on the target at high energy.  The crystal structure of the target can be damaged or even destroyed by the energetic collision cascades, and ions of sufficiently high energy (10s of MeV) can cause nuclear transmutation.

Jack Lemmon<====>15821<====>Jack Lemmon  John Uhler "Jack" Lemmon III (February 8, 1925 – June 27, 2001) was an American actor and musician. Lemmon was an eight time Academy Award nominee, with two wins. He starred in over 60 films, such as Some Like It Hot, The Apartment, Mister Roberts (for which he won the 1955 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), Days of Wine and Roses, The Great Race, Irma la Douce, The Odd Couple and its sequel 30 years later, The Odd Couple II,  (and other frequent collaborations with Odd Couple co-star Walter Matthau), Save the Tiger (for which he won the 1973 Academy Award for Best Actor), The Out-of-Towners, The China Syndrome, Missing (for which he won Best Actor at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival), Glengarry Glen Ross, Tuesdays with Morrie, Grumpy Old Men, and Grumpier Old Men.Early lifeLemmon was born on February 8, 1925, in an elevator  at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. He was the only child of Mildred Burgess LaRue  and John Uhler Lemmon, Jr., the president of a doughnut company.   Lemmon attended John Ward Elementary School in Newton and the Rivers School in Weston, Massachusetts. During his acceptance of his lifetime achievement award, he stated that he knew he wanted to be an actor from the age of eight. Lemmon attended Phillips Academy (Class of 1943) and Harvard College (Class of 1947), where he lived in Eliot House  and was an active member of several Drama Clubs – and president of the Hasty Pudding Club Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 1998  – as well as a member of the Delphic Club for Gentleman, a final club at Harvard.At Harvard, Lemmon was a member of the V-12 Navy College Training Program and was commissioned by the United States Navy,  serving briefly as an ensign on an aircraft carrier during World War II before returning to Harvard after completing his military service.  After graduation with a degree in War Service Sciences  in 1947,  Lemmon took up acting professionally, working on radio, television and Broadway.  He studied acting under coach Uta Hagen.  He was enamored of the piano and learned to play it on his own. He could also play the harmonica, guitar, organ, and the double bass.CareerLemmon's film debut was a bit part as a plasterer/painter in the 1949 film The Lady Takes a Sailor, but he went unnoticed until his debut, opposite Judy Holliday, in the 1954 comedy It Should Happen to You.  Lemmon worked with actresses such as Marilyn Monroe, Natalie Wood, Betty Grable, Janet Leigh, Shirley MacLaine, Lee Remick, Romy Schneider, Doris Day, Kim Novak, Judy Holliday, Rita Hayworth, June Allyson, Virna Lisi, Ann-Margret and Sophia Loren. He was close friends with actors Tony Curtis, Ernie Kovacs, Walter Matthau and Kevin Spacey. He made two films with Curtis, and fifteen with Matthau.Early in Lemmon's career he met comedian Ernie Kovacs while co-starring with him in Operation Mad Ball. Lemmon and Kovacs became close friends and appeared together in two subsequent films, Bell, Book and Candle and It Happened to Jane. In 1977, PBS broadcast a compilation series of Kovacs' television work, and Lemmon served as the narrator of the series. Lemmon discussed his friendship with Kovacs in the documentary Ernie Kovacs: Television's Original Genius.He was a favorite of director Billy Wilder, starring in the films Some Like It Hot (for which he was awarded Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival), The Apartment, Irma la Douce, The Fortune Cookie, Avanti!, The Front Page, and Buddy Buddy.  Wilder felt Lemmon had a natural tendency toward overacting that had to be tempered; the Wilder biography Nobody's Perfect quotes the director as saying, "Lemmon, I would describe him as a ham, a fine ham, and with ham you have to trim a little fat". The biography quotes Lemmon as saying, "I am particularly susceptible to the parts I play... If my character was having a nervous breakdown, I started to have one".He enjoyed longtime working relationships with both Blake Edwards, starring in  Days of Wine and Roses (1962), The Great Race (1965) and That's Life! (1986), and Richard Quine, starring in My Sister Eileen, Operation Mad Ball., Bell, Book and Candle and It Happened to Jane and How to Murder Your Wife (1965). Quine also directed Lemmon's screen test when the actor was signed by Columbia.Singing and piano playingLemmon's singing voice was first heard on two film soundtracks in 1955, Three for the Show with Betty Grable and My Sister Eileen. He also performed songs in the 1956 film You Can't Run Away from It with Stubby Kaye and June Allyson. His first solo album A Twist of Lemmon was released in 1958 on Epic Records. While filming Some Like It Hot with Marilyn Monroe in 1959, Lemmon released a second album, Some Like It Hot. Both featured Lemmon's singing and piano solos.The two Epic albums were later released as A Twist of Lemmon/Some Like It Hot, a single cd on Collector's Choice Music, in 2001. Two singles, Daphne/Sleepy Lagoon (released in 1959) and I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles/I Cover the Waterfront (released in 1960) did not appear on either album. Epic released a third single in 1960, Lemmon's piano solo of the theme to the film The Apartment, backed with his own composition Lemmon Blues. In 1963, Lemmon released a third album, this time on Capitol Records, entitled Jack Lemmon Plays Piano Selections from Irma La Douce.Awards and favorite filmsLemmon was awarded the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1956 for Mister Roberts (1955) and the Best Actor Oscar for Save the Tiger (1973), becoming the first actor to achieve this rare double (the only other actors to achieve this are: Robert De Niro, Gene Hackman, Jack Nicholson, Kevin Spacey and Denzel Washington).  He was also nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his role in the controversial film Missing in 1982, and for his roles in Some Like It Hot (1959), The Apartment (1960), Days of Wine and Roses (1962),  The China Syndrome  (1979), and Tribute (1980). He won another Cannes award for his performance in Missing (which received the Palme d'Or). In 1986, the U.S. National Board of Review of Motion Pictures gave Lemmon a "Career Achievement" award;  two years later, the American Film Institute gave him its Lifetime Achievement Award.Days of Wine and Roses (1962) was a favorite role. He portrayed Joe Clay, a young, fun-loving alcoholic businessman. In that film, Lemmon delivered the line, "My name is Joe Clay ... I'm an alcoholic." Three and a half decades later, he stated on the television program Inside the Actors Studio that he was a recovering alcoholic. Lemmon's production company JML produced Cool Hand Luke in 1967. Paul Newman was grateful to Lemmon for his support and offered him the role of the Sundance Kid, later played by Robert Redford in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, but Lemmon turned it down.  He did not like riding horses and he felt he'd already played too many aspects of the Sundance Kid's character before. Lemmon appeared in many films partnered with actor Walter Matthau. Among their pairings was 1968's The Odd Couple, as Felix Ungar (Lemmon) and Oscar Madison (Matthau). The first film they starred in together was The Fortune Cookie (for which Matthau won the 1966 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), The Front Page and Buddy Buddy. In 1971, Lemmon directed Matthau in the comedy Kotch. It was the only movie that Lemmon directed and Matthau was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for his performance.Additionally, Lemmon and Matthau had small parts in Oliver Stone's 1991 film, JFK (the only film in which both appeared without sharing screen time). In 1993, the duo teamed again to star in Grumpy Old Men. The film was a surprise hit, earning the two actors a new generation of young fans.  During the rest of the decade, they would star together in Grumpier Old Men, Out to Sea, and the widely panned The Odd Couple II. In 1996, Lemmon was awarded the Honorary Golden Bear award at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival.    In 1997, Lemmon was a guest voice on The Simpsons episode "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson," playing the character Frank Ormand, owner of the pretzel business that Marge Simpson franchised. The recurring character Gil Gunderson, voiced by Dan Castellaneta, is an ongoing parody of Lemmon's character in Glengarry Glen Ross.At the 1998 Golden Globe Awards, he was nominated for "Best Actor in a Made for TV Movie" for his role in Twelve Angry Men losing to Ving Rhames.  After accepting the award, Rhames asked Lemmon to come on stage and, in a move that stunned the audience, gave his award to him. (The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which presents the Golden Globes, had a second award made and sent to Rhames.).  He received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1988.Lemmon won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his role as Morrie Schwartz in his final television role, Tuesdays with Morrie. His final film role was an uncredited one: the narrator in Robert Redford's film The Legend of Bagger Vance.Actor Kevin Spacey recalled that Lemmon is remembered for always making time for other people. Already regarded as a legend, he met teenage Spacey backstage after a theater performance and spoke to him about pursuing an acting career.  Spacey would later work with Lemmon in The Murder of Mary Phagan (1987), Dad (1989), the critically acclaimed film Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) and on stage in a revival of Long Day's Journey into Night. Lemmon was Spacey's mentor, and taught Spacey that people who do well in a business have an obligation to "send the elevator back down" to help lift people starting out on the ground floor. In his autobiography, My Life, Burt Reynolds recalls Lemmon as the quintessential gentleman who never spoke ill of anyone, even if they deserved it. This kindness backfired for Reynolds: prior to accepting the lead in W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings (1975), directed by John G. Avildsen, Reynolds asked Lemmon, whom Avildsen had directed in Save the Tiger (1973) for an opinion of Avildsen as a director. Lemmon told Reynolds that Avildsen was "okay", and Reynolds accepted the role. After the film was released and his experiences in production proved unhappy, Reynolds complained to Lemmon and described Avildsen as an "asshole", whereupon Lemmon replied, "I guess you could say that." Personal lifeLemmon was married twice. His first wife was actress Cynthia Stone, with whom he had a son, Chris Lemmon (born 1954). His second wife was actress Felicia Farr, with whom he had a daughter, Courtney (born 1966). Farr had a daughter from a previous relationship (her marriage to Lee Farr) named Denise. Lemmon was a Catholic.  He publicly announced his alcoholism during a 1998 interview on Inside the Actors Studio. To golfers everywhere Lemmon was known as the "star" of the celebrity-packed third round telecast of the annual AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, held at Pebble Beach Golf Links each February.  Lemmon's packed gallery was there not only for his humor but also to root him on in his lifelong quest to "make the cut" to round 4, something he was not able to achieve.  The amateur who helps his team most in the Pro-Am portion is annually awarded the Jack Lemmon Award.During the 1980s and 1990s Lemmon served on the advisory board of the National Student Film Institute.  Lemmmon was a registered Democrat .DeathLemmon died of metastatic cancer of the bladder on June 27, 2001.  He had been fighting the disease, privately, for two years before his death. He was interred at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, California, buried near his friend and co-star, Walter Matthau, who died almost exactly one year before Lemmon. His gravestone reads like a title screen from a film: "JACK LEMMON in" FilmographyFilm1949 The Lady Takes a Sailor Plasterer Michael Curtiz Uncredited 1950 Once Too Often   Mike Unknown Uncredited 1953 It Should Happen to You Pete Sheppard George Cukor  1954 Phffft Robert Tracey Mark Robson  1955 Three for the Show Martin "Marty" Stewart H.

Jazz guitar<====>16141<====>Jazz guitar The term jazz guitar may refer to either a type of guitar or to the variety of guitar playing styles used in the various genres which are commonly termed "jazz".  The jazz-type guitar was born as a result of using electric amplification to increase the volume of conventional acoustic guitars. Conceived in the early 1930s, the electric guitar became a necessity as jazz musicians sought to amplify their sound to be heard over loud big bands.  When guitarists in big bands only had acoustic guitars, all they could do was play chords; they could not play solos because the acoustic guitar is not a loud instrument.

Jackals and coyotes (sometimes called the "American jackal" ) are opportunistic omnivores, predators of small to medium-sized animals and proficient scavengers.   Their long legs and curved canine teeth are adapted for hunting small mammals, birds, and reptiles, and their large feet and fused leg bones give them a physique well-suited for long-distance running, capable of maintaining speeds of   for extended periods of time.

JPEG Network Graphics<====>16194<====>JPEG Network Graphics JPEG Network Graphics (JNG,  ) is a JPEG-based graphics file format which is closely related to PNG: it uses the PNG file structure (with a different signature) as a container format to wrap JPEG-encoded image data. JNG was created as an adjunct to the MNG animation format, but may be used as a stand-alone format.  JNG files embed an 8-bit or 12-bit JPEG datastream in order to store color data, and may embed another datastream (1, 2, 4, 8, 16-bit PNG, or 8-bit JPEG grayscale image) for transparency information.  However, a JNG may contain two separate JPEG datastreams for color information (one 8-bit and one 12-bit) to permit decoders that are unable to (or do not wish to) handle 12-bit datastreams to display the 8-bit datastream instead, if one is present.

Jet stream<====>16472<====>Jet stream  Jet streams are fast flowing, narrow, meandering air currents in the atmospheres of some planets, including Earth.   On Earth, the main jet streams are located near the altitude of the tropopause and are westerly winds (flowing west to east).  Their paths typically have a meandering shape.  Jet streams may start, stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including opposite to the direction of the remainder of the jet. The strongest jet streams are the polar jets, at   above sea level, and the higher altitude and somewhat weaker subtropical jets at  .

This form of reflection is also distinct from the kinds of "deliberations" seen in other higher animals such as crows insofar as it is dependent on linguistic cognition.

Just intonation<====>16493<====>Just intonationIn music, just intonation (sometimes abbreviated as JI) or pure intonation is any musical tuning in which the frequencies of notes are related by ratios of small whole numbers.  Any interval tuned in this way is called a pure or just interval.   Pure intervals are important in music because they correspond to the vibrational patterns found in physical objects which correlate to human perception (see harmonic series).  The two notes in any just interval are members of the same harmonic series.   Frequency ratios involving large integers such as 1024:729 are not generally said to be justly tuned.

Janus kinase<====>16511<====>Janus kinaseJanus kinase (JAK) is a family of intracellular, nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that transduce cytokine-mediated signals via the JAK-STAT pathway.  They were initially named "just another kinase" 1 and 2 (since they were just two of a large number of discoveries in a PCR-based screen of kinases,   ) but were ultimately published as "Janus kinase".   The name is taken from the two-faced Roman god of beginnings and endings, Janus, because the JAKs possess two near-identical phosphate-transferring domains.  One domain exhibits the kinase activity, while the other negatively regulates the kinase activity of the first.

Swedish krona<====>16709<====>Swedish krona   The krona ( ; plural: kronor; sign: kr; code: SEK) has been the currency of Sweden since 1873.  Both the ISO code "SEK" and currency sign "kr" are in common use; the former precedes or follows the value, the latter usually follows it but, especially in the past, it sometimes preceded the value.  In English, the currency is sometimes referred to as the Swedish crown, as krona literally means crown in Swedish.  The Swedish krona was the 9th most traded currency in the world by value in April 2016.  One krona is subdivided into 100 öre (singular and plural; when referring to the currency unit itself, however, the plural definite form is ören).

Kattegat<====>16712<====>Kattegat The Kattegat ( ;  ,  ) is a   sea area bounded by the Jutlandic peninsula in the west, the Danish straits islands of Denmark to the south and the provinces of Västergötland, Scania, Halland and Bohuslän in Sweden in the east.  The Baltic Sea drains into the Kattegat through the Danish Straits.  The sea area is a continuation of the Skagerrak and may be seen as a bay of the Baltic Sea or the North Sea or, as in traditional Scandinavian usage, neither of these. The Kattegat is a rather shallow sea and can be very difficult and dangerous to navigate, due to the many sandy and stony reefs and tricky currents that often shift. 

Kolmogorov–Smirnov test<====>16714<====>Kolmogorov–Smirnov testIn statistics, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (K–S test or KS test) is a nonparametric test of the equality of continuous, one-dimensional probability distributions that can be used to compare a sample with a reference probability distribution (one-sample K–S test), or to compare two samples (two-sample K–S test).   It is named after  Andrey Kolmogorov and Nikolai Smirnov. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic quantifies a distance between the empirical distribution function of the sample and the cumulative distribution function of the reference distribution, or between the empirical distribution functions of two samples.  The null distribution of this statistic is calculated under the null hypothesis that the sample is drawn from the reference distribution (in the one-sample case) or that the samples are drawn from the same distribution (in the two-sample case). 

Kansas<====>16716<====>Kansas    {{Infobox U. S.  state symbols }}Kansas   is a U. S.  state in the Midwestern United States.   Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita.  Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area.   The tribe's name (natively  ) is often said to mean "people of the (south) wind" although this was probably not the term's original meaning.    For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes.  Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys.

Kuiper's test<====>16720<====>Kuiper's testKuiper's test is used in statistics to test that whether a given distribution, or family of distributions, is contradicted by evidence from a sample of data.  It is named after Dutch mathematician Nicolaas Kuiper.    Kuiper's test is closely related to the better-known Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (or K-S test as it is often called).  As with the K-S test, the discrepancy statistics D +  and D −  represent the absolute sizes of the most positive and most negative differences between the two cumulative distribution functions that are being compared.  The trick with Kuiper's test is to use the quantity D +  + D −  as the test statistic.

Considered along with Aristotle, Alfred Tarski and Gottlob Frege to be one of the most significant logicians in history, Gödel made an immense impact upon scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century, a time when others such as Bertrand Russell, For instance, in their Principia Mathematica (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy edition).   Alfred North Whitehead,  and David Hilbert were analyzing the use of logic and set theory to understand the foundations of mathematics pioneered by Georg Cantor. 

Karl Marx<====>16743<====>Karl Marx  Karl Marx The name "Karl Heinrich Marx", used in various lexicons, is based on an error.  His birth certificate says "Carl Heinrich Marx", and elsewhere "Karl Marx" is used.  "K.  H.  Marx" is used only in his poetry collections and the transcript of his dissertation; because Marx wanted to honour his father, who had died in 1838, he called himself "Karl Heinrich" in three documents.

Keno<====>16744<====>Keno Keno   is a lottery-like gambling game often played at modern casinos, and also offered as a game in some lotteries.   Players wager by choosing numbers ranging from 1 through (usually) 80.  After all players make their wagers, 20 numbers (some variants draw fewer numbers) are drawn at random, either with a ball machine similar to ones used for lotteries and bingo, or with a random number generator (RNG). Each casino sets its own series of payouts, called "paytables".  The player is paid based on how many numbers were chosen (either player selection, or the terminal picking the numbers), the number of matches out of those chosen, and the wager. 

Kenyanthropus<====>16745<====>Kenyanthropus    Kenyanthropus platyops is a 3. 5 to 3. 2-million-year-old (Pliocene) hominin fossil discovered in Lake Turkana, Kenya in 1999 by Justus Erus, who was part of Meave Leakey's team.  Leakey (2001) proposes that the fossil represents an entirely new hominin species and genus, while others classify it as a separate species of Australopithecus, Australopithecus platyops, and yet others interpret it as an individual of Australopithecus afarensis. Archaeological discoveries in Kenya in 2015, identifying possibly the oldest known evidence of hominin use of tools to date, have indicated that Kenyanthropus platyops may have been the earliest tool-users known. 

Karate<====>16746<====>Karate ( ;  ; Okinawan pronunciation:  ) is a martial art developed in the Ryukyu Kingdom.  It developed from the indigenous Ryukyuan martial arts (called  , "hand"; tii in Okinawan) under the influence of Chinese martial arts, particularly Fujian White Crane.   Karate is now predominantly a striking art using punching, kicking, knee strikes, elbow strikes and open-hand techniques such as knife-hands, spear-hands, and palm-heel strikes.  Historically, and in some modern styles, grappling, throws, joint locks, restraints, and vital-point strikes are also taught.    A karate practitioner is called a  . 

Kickboxing<====>16748<====>Kickboxing   Kickboxing is a group of stand-up combat sports based on kicking and punching, historically developed from Karate and Muay Thai but the modern kickboxing is mixed by taekwondo and boxing.    Kickboxing is practiced for self-defense, general fitness, or as a contact sport.    Japanese kickboxing originated in the 1960s, with competitions held since then.    American kickboxing originated in the 1970s and was brought to prominence in September 1974, when the Professional Karate Association (PKA) held the first World Championships.  Historically, kickboxing can be considered a hybrid martial art formed from the combination of elements of various traditional styles. 

Korea<====>16749<====>Korea Korea is a historical country in East Asia; since 1945, it has been divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the "Democratic People's Republic of Korea") and South Korea (officially the "Republic of Korea").  Located on the Korean Peninsula, Korea is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast.  It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan (East Sea) . Korea emerged as a singular political entity in 676 AD, after centuries of conflict among the Three Kingdoms of Korea, which were unified as Unified Silla to the south and Balhae to the north. 

Kleene star<====>16750<====>Kleene star In mathematical logic and computer science, the Kleene star (or Kleene operator or Kleene closure) is a unary operation, either on sets of strings or on sets of symbols or characters.  In mathematicsit is more commonly known as the free monoid construction.  The application of the Kleene star to a set V is written as V * .  It is widely used for regular expressions, which is the context in which it was introduced by Stephen Kleene to characterise certain automata, where it means "zero or more". If V is a set of strings, then V *  is defined as the smallest superset of V that contains the empty string ε and is closed under the string concatenation operation.

Kevlar<====>16759<====>Kevlar  Kevlar is the registered trademark for a para-aramid synthetic fiber, related to other aramids such as Nomex and Technora.  Developed by Stephanie Kwolek at DuPont in 1965,    this high-strength material was first commercially used in the early 1970s as a replacement for steel in racing tires.  Typically it is spun into ropes or fabric sheets that can be used as such or as an ingredient in composite material components. Currently, Kevlar has many applications, ranging from bicycle tires and racing sails to bulletproof vests, because of its high tensile strength-to-weight ratio; by this measure it is 5 times stronger than steel. 

Kosovo War<====>16760<====>Kosovo WarThe Kosovo War was an armed conflict in Kosovo that started in late February 1998   and lasted until 11 June 1999.

Klondike, Yukon<====>16792<====>Klondike, YukonThe Klondike ( ) is a region of the Yukon territory in northwest Canada, east of the Alaskan border.  It lies around the Klondike River, a small river that enters the Yukon River from the east at Dawson City. The Klondike is famed because of the Klondike Gold Rush, which started in 1897 and lasted until 1899.  Gold has been mined continuously in that area except for a hiatus in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The name "Klondike" evolved from the Hän word Tr'ondëk, which means "hammerstone water".  Early gold seekers found it difficult to pronounce the First Nations word, so "Klondike" was the result of this poor pronunciation. 

Korean cuisine<====>16793<====>Korean cuisine  Korean cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change.  Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions in the Korean peninsula and southern Manchuria, Korean cuisine has evolved through a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends.Korean cuisine is largely based on rice, vegetables, and meats.  Traditional Korean meals are noted for the number of side dishes (반찬; banchan) that accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice.  Kimchi is served at nearly every meal.  Commonly used ingredients include sesame oil, doenjang (fermented bean paste), soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, pepper flakes, gochujang (fermented red chili paste) and napa cabbage. 

Kilobyte<====>16794<====>Kilobyte The kilobyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information.  The International System of Units (SI) defines the prefix kilo as 1000 (10 3 ); per this definition, one kilobyte is 1000 bytes.  International Standard IEC 80000-13 Quantities and Units – Part 13: Information science and technology, International Electrotechnical Commission (2008).   The internationally recommended unit symbol for the kilobyte is kB.   In historical usage in some areas of information technology, particularly in reference to digital memory capacity, kilobyte  denotes 1024 (2 10 ) bytes.  This arises from the powers-of-two sizing common to memory circuit design. 

Karl Andree<====>16795<====>Karl AndreeKarl Andree (20 October 1808 – 10 August 1875) was a German geographer. BiographyAndree was born in Braunschweig.   He was educated at Jena, Göttingen, and Berlin.   After having been implicated in a students' political agitation he became a journalist, and in 1851 founded the newspaper Bremer Handelsblatt.  From 1855, however, he devoted himself entirely to geography and ethnography, working successively at Leipzig and at Dresden.   During the American Civil War, he advocated the cause of the secessionists.   In 1862 he founded the important geographical periodical Globus.  He died at Wildungen. 

Kuiper belt<====>16796<====>Kuiper belt   The Kuiper belt (  or  ),  occasionally called the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt, is a circumstellar disc in the outer Solar System, extending from the orbit of Neptune (at 30 AU) to approximately 50 AU from the Sun.   It is similar to the asteroid belt, but is far larger—20 times as wide and 20 to 200 times as massive. Like the asteroid belt, it consists mainly of small bodies or remnants from when the Solar System formed.  While many asteroids are composed primarily of rock and metal, most Kuiper belt objects are composed largely of frozen volatiles (termed "ices"), such as methane, ammonia and water. 

Kraftwerk<====>16797<====>Kraftwerk    Kraftwerk ( , "power station") is a German band formed in Düsseldorf in 1969 by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider.   The band was fronted by the duo until Schneider's departure in 2008.  Widely considered to be innovators and pioneers of electronic music, they were among the first successful acts to popularize the genre. Kraftwerk began as part of Germany's krautrock scene in the early 1970s, releasing three albums in an experimental rock style before embracing electronic instrumentation, including synthesizers, drum machines, vocoders, and self-made instruments, in the middle of the decade.

Ketone<====>16803<====>Ketone   In chemistry, a ketone (alkanone)   is an organic compound with the structure RC(=O)R', where R and R' can be a variety of carbon-containing substituents.  Ketones and aldehydes are simple compounds that contain a carbonyl group (a carbon-oxygen double bond).  They are considered "simple" because they do not have reactive groups like −OH or −Cl attached directly to the carbon atom in the carbonyl group, as in carboxylic acids containing −COOH.   Many ketones are known and many are of great importance in industry and in biology.  Examples include many sugars (ketoses) and the industrial solvent acetone, which is the smallest ketone. 

Ketene<====>16804<====>Ketene A ketene is an organic compound of the form R′R″C=C=O.  Ketene also refers to CH 2 =C=O, occasionally called ethenone.

Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem<====>16972<====>Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theoremThe Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem (KAM theorem) is a result in dynamical systems about the persistence of quasiperiodic motions under small perturbations.   The theorem partly resolves the small-divisor problem that arises in the perturbation theory of classical mechanics. The problem is whether or not a small perturbation of a conservative dynamical system results in a lasting quasiperiodic orbit.  The original breakthrough to this problem was given by Andrey Kolmogorov in 1954.   This was rigorously proved and extended by Jürgen Moser in 1962  (for smooth twist maps) and Vladimir Arnold in 1963  (for analytic Hamiltonian systems), and the general result is known as the KAM theorem. 

Knapsack problem<====>16974<====>Knapsack problem The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.  It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items. The problem often arises in resource allocation where there are financial constraints and is studied in fields such as combinatorics, computer science, complexity theory, cryptography, applied mathematics, and daily fantasy sports.

Ketoprofen<====>16978<====>Ketoprofen Ketoprofen, (RS)-2-(3-benzoylphenyl)-propionic acid (chemical formula C 16 H 14 O 3 ) is one of the propionic acid class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic effects.   It acts by inhibiting the body's production of prostaglandin. As of 2015 the cost for a typical month of medication in the United States is 50 to 100 USD.    Medical usesKetoprofen is generally prescribed for arthritis-related inflammatory pains or severe toothaches that result in the inflammation of the gums. Ketoprofen topical patches are being used for treatment of musculoskeletal pain. Ketoprofen can also be used for treatment of some pain, especially nerve pain such as sciatica, postherpetic neuralgia and referred pain for radiculopathy, in the form of a cream, ointment, liquid, spray, or gel, which may also contain ketamine and lidocaine, along with other agents which may be useful, such as cyclobenzaprine, amitriptyline, acyclovir, gabapentin, orphenadrine and other drugs used as NSAIDs or adjuvant, atypical or potentiators for pain treatment.

As its name suggests, this institute was founded modeled on IAS in Princeton, New Jersey (USA), although unlike its original, KIAS is funded by the government. 

Kabuki<====>16985<====>Kabukiis a classical Japanese dance-drama.  Kabuki theatre is known for the stylization of its drama and for the elaborate make-up worn by some of its performers. The individual kanji, from left to right, mean sing ( ), dance ( ), and skill ( ).  Kabuki is therefore sometimes translated as "the art of singing and dancing".  These are, however, ateji characters which do not reflect actual etymology.  The kanji of 'skill' generally refers to a performer in kabuki theatre.  Since the word kabuki is believed to derive from the verb kabuku, meaning "to lean" or "to be out of the ordinary", kabuki can be interpreted as "avant-garde" or "bizarre" theatre.

Knock-knock joke<====>16988<====>Knock-knock jokeThe knock-knock joke is a question-and-answer joke, typically ending with a pun.  Knock-knock jokes are primarily seen as children's jokes, though there are exceptions. The scenario is of a person knocking on the front door to a house.  The teller of the joke says, "Knock, knock!"; the recipient responds, "Who's there?" The teller gives a name (such as "Noah") or a description (such as "Police") or something that purports to be a name (such as "Needle").  The other person then responds by asking the caller's surname ("Noah who?" "Police who?" "Needle who?"), to which the joke-teller delivers a pun involving the name ("  place I can spend the night?" "  let me in—it's cold out here!" "  help with the groceries!").

Kwashiorkor<====>16994<====>Kwashiorkor Kwashiorkor is a form of severe protein–energy malnutrition characterized by edema, irritability, ulcerating dermatoses, and an enlarged liver with fatty infiltrates.  Sufficient calorie intake, but with insufficient protein consumption, distinguishes it from marasmus.  Kwashiorkor cases occur in areas of famine or poor food supply.    Cases in the developed world are rare.  Jamaican pediatrician Cicely Williams introduced the name into the medical community in a 1935 Lancet article, two years after she published the disease's first formal description in the Western medical literature.  Reprint:The name is derived from the Ga language of coastal Ghana, translated as "the sickness the baby gets when the new baby comes" or "the disease of the deposed child",    and reflecting the development of the condition in an older child who has been weaned from the breast when a younger sibling comes. 

Kundalini<====>16995<====>KundaliniKundalini (Sanskrit:    ,  , "coiled one"), in the concept of Dharma, refers to a form of primal energy (or shakti) said to be located at the base of the spine.  Writer Joseph Campbell describes the concept of Kundalini as "the figure of a coiled female serpent—a serpent goddess not of "gross" but "subtle" substance—which is to be thought of as residing in a torpid, slumbering state in a subtle center, the first of the seven, near the base of the spine: the aim of the yoga then being to rouse this serpent, lift her head, and bring her up a subtle nerve or channel of the spine to the so-called "thousand-petaled lotus" (Sahasrara) at the crown of the head.

Kohlrabi<====>17001<====>Kohlrabi    Kohlrabi (German turnip or turnip cabbage; Brassica oleracea Gongylodes Group) is a biennial vegetable, and is a low, stout cultivar of cabbage.  Kohlrabi can be eaten raw as well as cooked.  Edible preparations are made with both the stem and the leaves. EtymologyThe name comes from the German Kohl ("cabbage") plus Rübe ~ Rabi (Swiss German variant) ("turnip"), because the swollen stem resembles the latter.Kohlrabi is a commonly eaten vegetable in German-speaking countries, but is also very popular in the northern part of Vietnam where it is called 'su hào',  and in eastern parts of India (West Bengal) and Bangladesh where it is called 'Ol Kopi'. 

Tettigoniidae<====>17003<====>Tettigoniidae  Insects in the family Tettigoniidae are commonly called bush crickets    (in the UK), katydids (in the USA), or long-horned grasshoppers (mostly obsolete).  More than 6,400 species are known.  Part of the suborder Ensifera, Tettigoniidae is the only family in the superfamily Tettigonioidea. Primarily nocturnal in habit, with strident mating calls, many katydids exhibit mimicry and camouflage, commonly with shapes and colors similar to leaves.    EtymologyThe scientific name "Tettigoniidae" is derived from the genus Tettigonia, first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1748.  Latin tettigonia means leafhopper; it is from Greek tettigonion, the diminutive of the imitative (onomatopoeic) τέττιξ, tettix, cicada. 

Kennelly–Heaviside layer<====>17004<====>Kennelly–Heaviside layer The Kennelly–Heaviside layer, named after Arthur E.  Kennelly and Oliver Heaviside, also known as the E region or simply the Heaviside layer, is a layer of ionised gas occurring between roughly 90–150 km (56–93 mi) above the ground — one of several layers in the Earth's ionosphere.  It reflects medium-frequency radio waves, and because of this reflection, radio waves can be propagated beyond the horizon. Propagation is affected by time of day.  During the daytime the solar wind presses this layer closer to the Earth, thereby limiting how far it can reflect radio waves.   Conversely, on the night (lee) side of the Earth, the solar wind drags the ionosphere further away, thereby greatly increasing the range which radio waves can travel by reflection, called skywave. 

Knot<====>17006<====>Knot A knot is a method of fastening or securing linear material such as rope by tying or interweaving.  It may consist of a length of one or several segments of rope, string, webbing, twine, strap, or even chain interwoven such that the line can bind to itself or to some other object (the "load").  Knots have been the subject of interest for their ancient origins, their common uses, and the area of mathematics known as knot theory. Use There is a large variety of knots, each with properties that make it suitable for a range of tasks. 

Killer whale<====>17011<====>Killer whale   The killer whale or orca (Orcinus orca) is a toothed whale belonging to the oceanic dolphin family, of which it is the largest member.  Killer whales have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey.  Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and dolphins.  They have been known to attack baleen whale calves, and even adult whales.  Killer whales are apex predators, as there is no animal that preys on them.  Killer whales are considered a cosmopolitan species, and can be found in each of the world's oceans in a variety of marine environments, from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas - Killer whales are only absent from the Baltic and Black seas, and some areas of the Arctic ocean.

Karst<====>17022<====>Karst Karst is a topography formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks such as limestone, dolomite, and gypsum.  It is characterized by underground drainage systems with sinkholes and caves.   It has also been documented for more weathering-resistant rocks, such as quartzite, given the right conditions.   Subterranean drainage may limit surface water, with few to no rivers or lakes.  However, in regions where the dissolved bedrock is covered (perhaps by debris) or confined by one or more superimposed non-soluble rock strata, distinctive karst features may occur only at subsurface levels and be totally missing above ground. 

Kellogg–Briand Pact<====>17023<====>Kellogg–Briand Pact The Kellogg–Briand Pact (or Pact of Paris, officially General Treaty for Renunciation of War as an Instrument of National Policy ) is a 1928 international agreement in which signatory states promised not to use war to resolve "disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them".   Parties failing to abide by this promise "should be denied of the benefits furnished by [the] treaty".

Kidney<====>17025<====>Kidney  The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs found on the left and right sides of the body in vertebrates.  They are located at the back of the abdominal cavity in the retroperitoneal space.  In adults they are about   in length.   They receive blood from the paired renal arteries; blood exits into the paired renal veins.  Each kidney is attached to a ureter, a tube that carries excreted urine to the bladder. The nephron is the structural and functional unit of the kidney.  Each adult kidney contains around one million nephrons.  The nephron utilizes four processes to alter the blood plasma which flows to it: filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion.

Kyanite<====>17038<====>Kyanite Kyanite is a typically blue silicate mineral, commonly found in aluminium-rich metamorphic pegmatites and/or sedimentary rock.  Kyanite in metamorphic rocks generally indicates pressures higher than four kilobars.  Although potentially stable at lower pressure and low temperature, the activity of water is usually high enough under such conditions that it is replaced by hydrous aluminosilicates such as muscovite, pyrophyllite, or kaolinite.  Kyanite is also known as disthene, rhaeticite and cyanite. Kyanite is a member of the aluminosilicate series, which also includes the polymorph andalusite and the polymorph sillimanite.  Kyanite is strongly anisotropic, in that its hardness varies depending on its crystallographic direction. 

Kansas–Nebraska Act<====>17042<====>Kansas–Nebraska ActThe Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 ( ) created the territories of Kansas and Nebraska and was drafted by Democratic Senator Stephen A.  Douglas of Illinois and President Franklin Pierce.  The initial purpose of the Kansas–Nebraska Act was to open up thousands of new farms and make feasible a Midwestern Transcontinental Railroad.  The popular sovereignty clause of the law led pro- and anti-slavery elements to flood into Kansas with the goal of voting slavery up or down, resulting in Bleeding Kansas.  Background The availability of tens of millions of acres of excellent farmland in the area made it necessary to create a territorial infrastructure to allow settlement. 

Kaleidoscope<====>17043<====>Kaleidoscope  A kaleidoscope is an optical instrument with two or more reflecting surfaces tilted to each other in an angle, so that one or more (parts of) objects on one end of the mirrors are seen as a regular symmetrical pattern when viewed from the other end, due to repeated reflection.  The reflectors (or mirrors) are usually enclosed in a tube, often containing on one end a cell with loose, colored pieces of glass or other transparent (and/or opaque) materials to be reflected into the viewed pattern.  Rotation of the cell causes motion of the materials, resulting in an ever-changing viewed pattern.

Kangaroo<====>17064<====>Kangaroo The kangaroo is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning "large foot").  In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, especially those of the genus Macropus: the red kangaroo, antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western grey kangaroo. Kangaroos are indigenous to Australia.  The Australian government estimates that 34. 3 million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2011, up from 25. 1 million one year earlier.  As with the terms "wallaroo" and "wallaby", "kangaroo" refers to a polyphyletic grouping of species. 

Kirlian photography<====>17066<====>Kirlian photography Kirlian photography is a collection of photographic techniques used to capture the phenomenon of electrical coronal discharges.  It is named after Semyon Kirlian, who, in 1939, accidentally discovered that if an object on a photographic plate is connected to a high-voltage source, an image is produced on the photographic plate.  Julie McCarron-Benson in Skeptical - a Handbook of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal, ed Donald Laycock, David Vernon, Colin Groves, Simon Brown, Imagecraft, Canberra, 1989,  , p11 The technique has been variously known as"electrography",   "electrophotography",   "corona discharge photography" (CDP),   "bioelectrography",   "gas discharge visualization (GDV)",   "electrophotonic imaging (EPI)",    and, in Russian literature, "Kirlianography".

Kaluza–Klein theory<====>17070<====>Kaluza–Klein theory  In physics, Kaluza–Klein theory (KK theory) is a unified field theory of gravitation and electromagnetism built around the idea of a fifth dimension beyond the usual four of space and time.  It is considered to be an important precursor to string theory. The five-dimensional theory was developed in three steps.  The original hypothesis came from Theodor Kaluza, who sent his results to Einstein in 1919,  and published them in 1921.Kaluza's theory was a purely classical extension of general relativity to five dimensions.  The five-dimensional metric has 15 components.

KA9Q<====>17106<====>KA9QKA9Q, also called KA9Q NOS or simply NOS, was a popular early implementation of TCP/IP and associated protocols for amateur packet radio systems and smaller personal computers connected via serial lines.  It was named after the amateur radio callsign of Phil Karn, who first wrote the software for a CP/M system and then ported it to DOS on the IBM PC.  As the KA9Q code was open-source, many radio amateurs modified it, so many different versions were available at the same time. KA9Q was later maintained by Anthony Frost (callsign G8UDV) and Adam Goodfellow.  It was ported to the Acorn Archimedes by Jonathan Naylor (G4KLX). 

Hash-based message authentication code<====>17112<====>Hash-based message authentication codeIn cryptography, a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) is a specific type of message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic hash function and a secret cryptographic key.   It may be used to simultaneously verify both the data integrity and the authentication of a message, as with any MAC.   Any cryptographic hash function, such as MD5 or SHA-1, may be used in the calculation of an HMAC; the resulting MAC algorithm is termed HMAC-X, where X is the hash function used (e. g.  HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA1).  The cryptographic strength of the HMAC depends upon the cryptographic strength of the underlying hash function, the size of its hash output, and the size and quality of the key.

Key escrow<====>17114<====>Key escrow Key escrow (also known as a “fair” cryptosystem) is an arrangement in which the keys needed to decrypt encrypted data are held in escrow so that, under certain circumstances, an authorized third party may gain access to those keys.  These third parties may include businesses, who may want access to employees' private communications, or governments, who may wish to be able to view the contents of encrypted communications. The technical problem is a largely structural one since access to protected information must be provided only to the intended recipient and at least one third party.  The third party should be permitted access only under carefully controlled conditions, as for instance, a court order. 

Key frame<====>17116<====>Key frame A key frame in animation and filmmaking is a drawing that defines the starting and ending points of any smooth transition.  The drawings are called "frames" because their position in time is measured in frames on a strip of film.  A sequence of key frames defines which movement the viewer will see, whereas the position of the key frames on the film, video, or animation defines the timing of the movement.  Because only two or three key frames over the span of a second do not create the illusion of movement, the remaining frames are filled with inbetweens.

Killer micro<====>17147<====>Killer microA killer micro is a microprocessor-based machine that infringes on mini, mainframe, or supercomputer performance turf.  It originally referred to the replacement of vector supercomputers built with bipolar technology by Massively Parallel Processors (MPP) assembled from a larger number of lower performing microprocessors.   These systems faced initial skepticism, based on the assumption that applications do not have significant parallelism, because of Amdahl's law, but the success of early systems such as nCUBE and the fast progress in microprocessor performance following Moore's law led to a fast replacement. Taken from the title of Eugene Brooks' (of Lawrence Livermore Lab) talk  "Attack of the Killer Micros" at Supercomputing 1990. 

Killer poke<====>17148<====>Killer poke In computer jargon, a killer poke is a method of inducing physical hardware damage on a machine or its peripherals by the insertion of invalid values, via, for example, BASIC's POKE command, into a memory-mapped control register.  The term is typically used to describe a family of fairly well known tricks that can overload the analog electronics in the CRT monitors of computers lacking hardware sanity checking (notable examples being the IBM Portable  and Commodore PET. )Specific examplesCommodore PETThe PET-specific killer poke is connected to the architecture of that machine's video rasterizer circuits.  In early PETs, writing a certain value to the memory address of a certain I/O register ( POKE 59458,62  ) made the machine able to display text on the screen much faster. 

Kill file<====>17149<====>Kill file A kill file (also killfile, bozo bin or twit list) is a per-user file used by some Usenet reading programs to discard articles matching some unwanted patterns of subject, author, or other header lines.   It was first implemented in Larry Wall's rn. Thus to add a person or subject to one's kill file is to arrange for that person or topic to be ignored by one's newsreader in the future.  By extension, the term may be used for a decision to ignore the person or subject in other media.  Sometimes more than one kill file will be used. 

Kilobit<====>17152<====>Kilobit The kilobit is a multiple of the unit bit for digital information or computer storage.  The prefix kilo- (symbol k) is defined in the International System of Units (SI) as a multiplier of 10 3  (1 thousand),  and therefore,1 kilobit =   = 1000 bits. The kilobit has the unit symbol kbit or kb. Using the common byte size of 8 bits, 1 kbit is equal to 125 bytes. The kilobit is commonly used in the expression of data rates of digital communication circuits as kilobits per second (kbit/s or kb/s), or abbreviated as kbps,  as in, for example, a 56 kbps PSTN circuit, or a 512 kbit/s broadband Internet connection. 

Kit Carson<====>17154<====>Kit Carson   Christopher Houston Carson (December 24, 1809 – May 23, 1868), better known as Kit Carson, was an American frontiersman.  He was a mountain man (fur trapper), wilderness guide, Indian agent, and U. S.  Army officer.  Carson became a frontier legend in his own lifetime via biographies and news articles.  Exaggerated versions of his exploits were the subject of dime novels. Carson left home in rural present-day Missouri at age 16 to become a mountain man and trapper in the West.  In the 1830s, he accompanied Ewing Young on an expedition to Mexican California and joined fur trapping expeditions into the Rocky Mountains.

Kipper<====>17156<====>Kipper  A kipper is a whole herring, a small, oily fish,  that has been split in a butterfly fashion from tail to head along the dorsal ridge, gutted, salted or pickled, and cold-smoked over smouldering woodchips (typically oak). In the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man, Japan, and a few North American regions, they are often eaten for breakfast.  In Great Britain, kippers, along with other preserved smoked or salted fish such as the bloater and buckling, were also once commonly enjoyed as a high tea or supper treat, most popularly with inland and urban working-class populations before World War II. 

Kipsigis people<====>17157<====>Kipsigis people  The Kipsigis are a Nilotic ethnic group of Kenya.  Their first language is Kipsigis, which belongs to the Nilo-Saharan language family.  The traditional occupation of the Kipsigis is herding.  In pre-colonial Kipsigis society, there was a warrior element.  Living on the Western Highlands at an altitude of 1500 to 2000m, the Kipsigis now also grow maize, wheat, pyrethrum and tea.  HistoryThe Kipsigis describe their place of origin as To near Lake Baringo.  The Kipsigis are a Nilotic (Nilo hamitic) people.  They are the most populous sub-group of the Kalenjin, a subdivision of Nilotes, who originated in the South Sudan region. 

Knife<====>17160<====>Knife A knife (plural knives) is a tool with a cutting edge or blade, hand-held or otherwise, with most having a handle.   Some types of knives are used as utensils, including knives used at the dining table (e. g. , butter knives and steak knives) and knives used in the kitchen (e. g. , paring knife, bread knife, cleaver).  Many types of knives are used as tools, such as the combat knife carried by soldiers, the pocket knife carried by hikers and the hunting knife used by hunters.  Knives are also used as a traditional or religious implement, such as the kirpan. 

Knockout<====>17163<====>Knockout A knockout (abbreviated to KO or K. O. ) is a fight-ending, winning criterion in several full-contact combat sports, such as boxing, kickboxing, muay thai, mixed martial arts, karate, some forms of taekwondo, and other sports involving striking, as well as fighting-based video games.  A full knockout is considered any legal strike or combination thereof that renders an opponent unable to continue fighting. The term is often associated with a sudden traumatic loss of consciousness caused by a physical blow.  Single powerful blows to the head (particularly the jawline and temple) can produce a cerebral concussion or a carotid sinus reflex with syncope and cause a sudden, dramatic KO. 

Kalahari Desert<====>17165<====>Kalahari Desert   The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for  , covering much of Botswana, parts of Namibia and regions of South Africa. EtymologyKalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning "the great thirst", or Kgalagadi, meaning "a waterless place";    the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.   GeographyDrainage of the desert is by dry valleys, seasonally inundated pans and the large salt pans of the Makgadikgadi Pan in Botswana and Etosha Pan in Namibia.  The only permanent river, the Okavango, flows into a delta in the northwest, forming marshes that are rich in wildlife. 

Katanga Province<====>17166<====>Katanga Province  Katanga was one of the eleven provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 1966 and 2015, when it was split into the Tanganyika, Haut-Lomami, Lualaba and Haut-Katanga provinces.  Between 1971 and 1997 (during the rule of Mobutu Sese Seko when Congo was known as Zaïre), its official name was Shaba Province.  Katanga's area encompassed  .  Farming and ranching are carried out on the Katanga Plateau.  The eastern part of the province is considered to be a rich mining region, which supplies cobalt, copper, tin, radium, uranium, and diamonds.  The region's former capital, Lubumbashi, is the second largest city in the Congo. 

Kathmandu<====>17168<====>KathmanduKathmandu ( ;   ,   Yei, Nepali pronunciation:  ) is the capital city of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, the larger of the two Himalayan states.  It is the  largest metropolis in Nepal, with a population of 1. 5 million in the city proper, and 3 million in its urban agglomeration across the Kathmandu Valley, which includes the towns of Lalitpur, Kirtipur, Madhyapur Thimi, Bhaktapur and the municipalities across Kathmandu valley.  Kathmandu is also the largest metropolis in the Himalayan hill region. The city stands at an elevation of approximately   above sea level in the bowl-shaped Kathmandu Valley of central Nepal. 

Kington Magna<====>17169<====>Kington Magna Kington Magna is a village and civil parish in the Blackmore Vale in the English county of Dorset, situated about   south-west of the town of Gillingham, in the North Dorset administrative district. HistoryThe name Kington Magna means 'great King's Town';it derives from cyne- (later cyning) and tūn, Old English for 'royal estate or manor'.  The affix magna, Latin for great, was added to distinguish it from Little Kington, a smaller settlement nearby.   In 1086 in the Domesday Book these were recorded together in three entries as Chintone, which had 27 households and a total taxable value of 13 geld units, and was in the hundred of Gillingham. 

Kiosk<====>17171<====>Kiosk A kiosk ( ,  ) is a small, separated garden pavilion open on some or all sides.  Kiosks were common in Persia, the Indian subcontinent, and in the Ottoman Empire from the 13th century onward.  Today, there are many kiosks in and around the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul, and they are still a relatively common sight in Balkan states. The word is now applied to small booths offering goods and services and to freestanding computer terminals. Small shops  In the Western hemisphere and in English-speaking countries, a kiosk is also a booth with an open window on one side. 

Knowbot Information Service<====>17174<====>Knowbot Information Service The Knowbot Information Service (KIS), also known as netaddress, is an Internet user search engine that debuted in December 1989.  Although it searched users, not content, it could be argued to be the first search engine on the Internet as it queried more than a single network for information.  It provided a uniform user interface to a variety of remote directory services such as whois, finger, X. 500, and MCI Mail.  By submitting a single query to KIS, a user can search a set of remote white pages services and see the results of the search in a uniform format. 

KISS (system)<====>17175<====>KISS (system) KISS is an early low-level programming language on the IBM 650 business computer. It was listed in the Communications of the ACM 2(5):16 (May 1959).References  

KISS principle<====>17176<====>KISS principleKISS is an acronym for "Keep it simple, stupid" as a design principle noted by the U. S.  Navy in 1960.    The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.  The phrase has been associated with aircraft engineer Kelly Johnson (1910–1990).   The term "KISS principle" was in popular use by 1970.   Variations on the phrase include: "Keep it simple, silly", "keep it short and simple", "keep it simple and straightforward",    "keep it small and simple" and "keep it stupid, simple".

Today Klamath people are enrolled in the federally recognized tribes:Klamath Tribes, OregonQuartz Valley Indian Community, California. HistoryPre-contactThe Klamath people lived in the area around the Upper Klamath Lake and the Klamath, Williamson, and Sprague rivers.   They subsisted primarily on fish and gathered roots and seeds.  While there was knowledge of their immediate neighbors, apparently the Klamath were unaware of the existence of the Pacific Ocean.  Gatschet has described this position as leaving the Klamath living in a "protracted isolation" from outside cultures. 

Klerer-May System<====>17186<====>Klerer-May SystemThe Klerer-May System is a programming language developed in the mid-1960s, oriented to numerical scientific programming, whose most notable feature is its two-dimensional syntax based on traditional mathematical notation. For input and output, the Klerer-May system used a Friden Flexowriter modified to allow half-line motions for subscripts and superscripts.The character set included digits, upper-case letters, subsets of 14 lower-case Latin letters and 18 Greek letters, arithmetic operators ( +   −   ×   /   | ) and punctuation ( .    ,   (   ) ), and eight special line-drawing characters (resembling   ╲   ╱   ⎜   _   ⎨   ⎬   ˘   ⁔ ) used to construct multi-line brackets and symbols for summation, products, roots, and for multi-line division or fractions. 

KL-ONE<====>17188<====>KL-ONE KL-ONE (pronounced "kay ell won") is a well known knowledge representation system in the tradition of semantic networks and frames; that is, it is a frame language.  The system is an attempt to overcome semantic indistinctness in semantic network representations and to explicitly represent conceptual information as a structured inheritance network.    There is a whole family of KL-ONE-like systems.  One of the innovations that KL-ONE initiated was the use of a deductive classifier, an automated reasoning engine that can validate a frame ontology and deduce new information about the ontology based on the initial information provided by a domain expert.

Kana<====>17204<====>Kana are syllabic Japanese scripts, a part of the Japanese writing system contrasted with the logographic Chinese characters known in Japan as kanji ( ).  There are three kana scripts: modern cursive hiragana ( );  modern angular katakana ( ); and the old syllabic use of kanji known as man'yōgana ( ) that was ancestral to both.  Hentaigana ( , "variant kana") are historical variants of modern standard hiragana.  In modern Japanese, hiragana and katakana have directly corresponding character sets (different sets of characters representing the same sounds). Katakana with a few additions is also used to write Ainu. 

Knights of the Lambda Calculus<====>17209<====>Knights of the Lambda CalculusThe Knights of the Lambda Calculus is a semi-fictional organization of expert Lisp and Scheme hackers.  The name refers to the lambda calculus, a mathematical formalism invented by Alonzo Church, with which Lisp is intimately connected, and references the Knights Templar. There is no actual organization that goes by the name Knights of the Lambda Calculus; it mostly only exists as a hacker culture in-joke.  The concept most likely originated at MIT.  For example, in the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs video lectures, one of the lecturers presents the audience with the button, saying they are now members of this special group. 

Knowbot<====>17210<====>Knowbot A knowbot is a kind of bot that collects information by automatically gathering certain specified information from web sites. KNOWBOT is the acronym for Knowledge-Based Object Technology.   This term, used as early as 1988  and known to have been implemented by December 1989 at the latest  describes computer-based objects developed for collecting and storing specific information, in order to use that information to accomplish a specific task, and to enable sharing that information with other objects or processes.  An early use of knowbots was to provide a computerized assistant to users to complete redundant detailed tasks without a need to train the user in computer technology.

Kilt<====>17214<====>Kilt   A kilt (   )  is a knee-length non-  skirt-type garment, with pleats at the back, originating in the traditional dress of Gaelic men and boys in the Scottish Highlands.  It is first recorded in the 16th century as the great kilt, a full-length garment whose upper half could be worn as a cloak.  The small kilt or 'modern' kilt emerged in the 18th century, and is essentially the bottom half of the great kilt.  Since the 19th century, it has become associated with the wider culture of Scotland, and more broadly with Gaelic or Celtic heritage.

She went into hiding in 1976 after having been indicted in a bombing case.  She has lived much of her life under the alias Sara Jane Olson, which is now her legal name.  Arrested in 1999, she pleaded guilty in 2001 to two counts of possessing explosives with intent to murder, and in 2003 to second-degree murder, both stemming from her SLA activities in the 1970s. 

Kent Recursive Calculator<====>17224<====>Kent Recursive Calculator KRC (Kent Recursive Calculator) is a lazy functional language developed by David Turner from November 1979 to October 1981  based on SASL, with pattern matching, guards and ZF expressions  (now more usually called list comprehensions). Two implementations of KRC were written: David Turner's original one in BCPL running on EMAS, and Simon J.  Croft's later one in C under Unix, and KRC was the main language used for teaching functional programming at the University of Kent at Canterbury (UK) from 1982 to 1985. The direct successor to KRC is Miranda, which includes a polymorphic type discipline based on that of Milner's ML. 

Kremvax<====>17226<====>KremvaxKremvax was originally a fictitious Usenet site at the Kremlin, named like the then large number of Usenet VAXen with names of the form foovax.  Kremvax was announced on April 1, 1984 in a posting ostensibly originated there by Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko.  The posting was actually forged by Piet Beertema of CWI (in Amsterdam) as an April Fool's joke.Other fictitious sites mentioned in the hoax were moskvax and kgbvax.   The actual origin of the email was mcvax, one of the first European sites on the internet.    Six years later Usenet was joined by demos. 

KRL (programming language)<====>17227<====>KRL (programming language)  KRL is a knowledge representation language, developed by Daniel G.  Bobrow and Terry Winograd while at Xerox PARC and Stanford University, respectively.  It is a frame-based language.   KRL was an attempt to produce a language which was nice to read and write for the engineers who had to write programs in it, processed like human memory, so you could have realistic AI programs, had an underlying semantics which was firmly grounded like logic languages, all in one, all in one language.  And I think it - again, in hindsight - it just bogged down under the weight of trying to satisfy all those things at once.

Kyoto Common Lisp<====>17241<====>Kyoto Common Lisp Kyoto Common Lisp (KCL) is an implementation of Common Lisp by Taichi Yuasa and Masami Hagiya, written in C to run under Unix-like operating systems.  KCL is compiled to ANSI C.  It conforms to Common Lisp as described in the 1984 first edition of Guy Steele's book Common Lisp the Language and is available under a licence agreement. KCL is notable in that it was implemented from scratch, outside of the standard committee, solely on the basis of the specification.  It was one of the first Common Lisp implementations ever, and exposed a number of holes and mistakes in the specification that had gone unnoticed.

The theories forming the basis of Keynesian economics were first presented by the British economist John Maynard Keynes during the Great Depression in his 1936 book, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. 

Kinetic energy<====>17327<====>Kinetic energy  In physics, the kinetic energy of an object is the energy that it possesses due to its motion.   , Chapter 1, p.  9 It is defined as the work needed to accelerate a body of a given mass from rest to its stated velocity.  Having gained this energy during its acceleration, the body maintains this kinetic energy unless its speed changes.  The same amount of work is done by the body when decelerating from its current speed to a state of rest. In classical mechanics, the kinetic energy of a non-rotating object of mass m traveling at a speed v is  .

Kaiser Wilhelm II greatly expanded the navy, and enlarged its mission.  The key leader was Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, who greatly expanded the size and quality of the navy, while adopting the sea power theories of American strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan.  The result was a naval arms race with Britain as the German navy grew to become one of the greatest maritime forces in the world, second only to the Royal Navy.

Key signature<====>17394<====>Key signature In musical notation, a key signature is a set of sharp ( ), flat ( ), and rarely, natural ( ) symbols placed together on the staff.   Key signatures are generally written immediately after the clef at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a score, notably after a double barline. A key signature designates notes that are to be played higher or lower than the corresponding natural notes and applies through to the end of the piece or up to the next key signature.   A sharp symbol on a line or space in the key signature raises the notes on that line or space one semitone above the natural, and a flat lowers such notes one semitone.

Konix Multisystem<====>17411<====>Konix Multisystem  The Konix Multisystem was a cancelled video game system under development by Konix, a British manufacturer of computer peripherals. BackgroundThe Konix Multisystem began life in 1988 as an advanced Konix peripheral design intended to build on the success of the company's range of joysticks.  The design, codenamed Slipstream,  resembled a dashboard-style games controller, and could be configured with a steering wheel, a flight yoke, and motorbike handles.  It promised advanced features such as force feedback, hitherto unheard of in home gaming.  However, it soon became apparent that the Slipstream project had the potential to be much more than a peripheral. 

Klein bottle<====>17412<====>Klein bottleIn mathematics, the Klein bottle   is an example of a non-orientable surface; it is a two-dimensional manifold against which a system for determining a normal vector cannot be consistently defined.   Informally, it is a one-sided surface which, if traveled upon, could be followed back to the point of origin while flipping the traveler upside down.   Other related non-orientable objects include the Möbius strip and the real projective plane.  Whereas a Möbius strip is a surface with boundary, a Klein bottle has no boundary (for comparison, a sphere is an orientable surface with no boundary).

Kingdom of Judah<====>17423<====>Kingdom of Judah   The Kingdom of Judah ( , Mamlekhet Yehudāh) was an Iron Age kingdom of the Southern Levant.  The Hebrew Bible depicts it as the successor to a United Monarchy, but historians are divided about the veracity of this account.  In the 10th and early 9th centuries, BCE the territory of Judah appears to have been sparsely populated, limited to small rural settlements, most of them unfortified.  Jerusalem in the 10th century BCE   Jerusalem, the kingdom's capital, likely did not emerge as a significant administrative center until the end of the 8th century; before this the archaeological evidence suggests its population was too small to sustain a viable kingdom. 

Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)<====>17424<====>Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)   According to the Hebrew Bible, the Kingdom of Israel ( ) was one of two successor states to the former United Kingdom of Israel and Judah.  Historians often refer to the Kingdom of Israel as the "Northern Kingdom" or as the "Kingdom of Samaria" to differentiate it from the Southern Kingdom of Judah. Modern scholarship, incorporating textual criticism and archaeology, has challenged the biblical account that the northern kingdom of Israel broke off from a united monarchy with the southern kingdom of Judah, suggesting instead that the northern civilization of Israel developed independently of Judah (a comparatively small and rural area), and that it first reached the political, economic, military and architectural sophistication of a kingdom under the Omride dynasty around 884 BCE.

Kittiwake<====>17445<====>Kittiwake  The kittiwakes (genus Rissa) are two closely related seabird species in the gull family Laridae, the black-legged kittiwake (R.  tridactyla) and the red-legged kittiwake (R.  brevirostris).

Its beak does not have the red of other birds in the kittiwake family but black near the ends of their beaks(correct).   The epithets "black-legged" and "red-legged" are used to distinguish the two species in North America, but in Europe, where R.  brevirostris is not found, the black-legged kittiwake is often known simply as kittiwake, or more colloquially in some areas as tickleass or tickleace.

Kocher–Debre–Semelaigne syndrome<====>17455<====>Kocher–Debre–Semelaigne syndrome The Kocher–Debré–Semelaigne syndrome is hypothyroidism in infancy or childhood characterised by lower extremity or generalized muscular hypertrophy, myxoedema, short stature and cretinism.  The absence of painful spasms and pseudomyotonia differentiates this syndrome from its adult form, which is Hoffmann syndrome. The syndrome is named after Emil Theodor Kocher, Robert Debré and Georges Semelaigne.Also known as Debre–Semelaigne syndrome or cretinism-muscular hypertrophy, hypothyroid myopathy, hypothyroidism-large muscle syndrome, hypothyreotic muscular hypertrophy in children, infantile myxoedema-muscular hypertrophy, myopathy-myxoedema syndrome, myxoedema-muscular hypertrophy syndrome, myxoedema-myotonic dystrophy syndrome.Kocher-Debre-Semelaigne syndrome gives infant a Hercules appearance.

Koi<====>17459<====>Koior more specifically  , are colored varieties of Amur carp (Cyprinus rubrofuscus) that are kept for decorative purposes in outdoor koi ponds or water gardens. Koi is an informal group of the colored variants of the Amur carp.  Several  varieties are recognized by the Japanese.  Koi varieties are distinguished by coloration, patterning, and scalation.  Some of the major colors are white, black, red, yellow, blue, and cream.  The most popular category of koi is the Gosanke, which is made up of the Kohaku, Taisho Sanshoku, and Showa Sanshoku varieties. 

Knut Hamsun<====>17461<====>Knut Hamsun  Knut Hamsun (August 4, 1859 – February 19, 1952) was  a major Norwegian writer, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1920.  Hamsun's work spans more than 70 years and shows variation with regard to the subject, perspective and environment.  He published more than 20 novels, a collection of poetry, some short stories and plays, a travelogue, and some essays. The young Hamsun objected to realism and naturalism.  He argued that the main object of modernist literature should be the intricacies of the human mind, that writers should describe the "whisper of blood, and the pleading of bone marrow".

Keiretsu<====>17467<====>KeiretsuA   is a set of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings.  It is a type of informal business group.  The keiretsu maintained dominance over the Japanese economy for the second half of the 20th century. The members companies own small portions of the shares in each other's companies, centered on a core bank; this system helps insulate each company from stock market fluctuations and takeover attempts, thus enabling long-term planning in projects.  It is a key element of the manufacturing industry in Japan. HistoryThe prototypical keiretsu appeared in Japan during the "economic miracle" following World War II and the collapse of family-controlled vertical monopolies called zaibatsu. 

Kurt Georg Kiesinger<====>17470<====>Kurt Georg Kiesinger Kurt Georg Kiesinger ( ; 6 April 1904 – 9 March 1988) was a German politician who served as Chancellor of Germany (West Germany) from 1 December 1966 to 21 October 1969.

Lynx<====>17479<====>Lynx   A lynx ( ;    plural lynx or lynxes   ) is any of the four species within the Lynx genus of medium-sized wild cats, which includes the bobcat.  The name "lynx" originated in Middle English via Latin from the Greek word λύγξ,  derived from the Indo-European root leuk- ("light, brightness")    in reference to the luminescence of its reflective eyes.  The genus Lynx includes neither the caracal nor the jungle cat, sometimes called the desert lynx and the jungle lynx respectively. AppearanceLynx have a short tail, characteristic tufts of black hair on the tips of their ears, large, padded paws for walking on snow and long whiskers on the face. 

Leisure<====>17503<====>LeisureLeisure has often been defined as a quality of experience or as free time. Free time is time spent away from business, work, job hunting, domestic chores, and education, as well as necessary activities such as eating and sleeping.  From a research perspective, this approach has the advantages of being quantifiable and comparable over time and place.  Leisure as experience usually emphasizes dimensions of perceived freedom and choice.  It is done for "its own sake", for the quality of experience and involvement.   Other classic definitions include Thorsten Veblen's (1899) of "nonproductive consumption of time.

Latvia<====>17514<====>Latvia  Latvia, ( ;    ), officially the Republic of Latvia ( ), is a country in the Baltic region of Northern Europe, one of the three Baltic states.   It is bordered by Estonia to the north, Lithuania to the south, Russia to the east, and Belarus to the southeast, as well as sharing a maritime border with Sweden to the west.  Latvia has 1,957,200 inhabitants  and a territory of  .The country has a temperate seasonal climate.  After centuries of Swedish, Livonian, Polish and Russian rule, a rule mainly executed by the Baltic German aristocracy, the Republic of Latvia was established on 18 November 1918 after declaring independence from Russia in the aftermath of World War I. 

Luxembourg<====>17515<====>Luxembourg    Luxembourg ( ) (   ;  ,  ), officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg,  is a landlocked country in western Europe.  It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south.  Its capital, Luxembourg City, together with Brussels and Strasbourg, is one of the three official capitals of the European Union  and the seat of the European Court of Justice, the highest judicial authority in the EU.  Its culture, people and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbours, making it essentially a mixture of French and Germanic cultures. 

Location parameter<====>17516<====>Location parameter In statistics, a location family is a class of probability distributions that is parametrized by a scalar- or vector-valued parameter  x_0 , which determines the "location" or shift of the distribution.  Formally, this means that the probability density functions or probability mass functions in this class have the form f_{x_0}(x) = f(x - x_0).  Here,  x_0  is called the location parameter.  Examples of location parameters include the mean, the median, and the mode. Thus in the one-dimensional case if  x_0  is increased, the probability density or mass function shifts rigidly to the right, maintaining its exact shape. 

Larry Wall<====>17519<====>Larry Wall  Larry Wall (born September 27, 1954)  is a computer programmer and author.  He created the Perl programming language. Personal lifeWall grew up in Los Angeles and then Bremerton, Washington, before starting higher education at Seattle Pacific University in 1976, majoring in chemistry and music and later pre-medicine with a hiatus of several years working in the university's computing center before graduating with a bachelor's degree in Natural and Artificial Languages.    While in graduate school at the  University of California, Berkeley, Wall and his wife were studying linguistics with the intention of finding an unwritten language, perhaps in Africa, and creating a writing system for it. 

Language<====>17524<====>LanguageLanguage is a system that consists of the development, acquisition, maintenance and use of complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so ; and a language is any specific example of such a system.  The scientific study of language is called linguistics.  Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated at least since Gorgias and Plato in ancient Greece.  Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 

Laura Bush<====>17528<====>Laura BushLaura Lane Welch Bush (born November 4, 1946) is the wife of the 43rd President of the United States, George W.  Bush, and was the First Lady from 2001 to 2009.

After attaining her master's degree in library science at the University of Texas at Austin, she was employed as a librarian. Bush met her future husband, George W.  Bush, in 1977, and they were married later that year. 

Lorisidae<====>17532<====>Lorisidae Lorisidae (or sometimes Loridae) is a family of strepsirrhine primates.  The lorisids are all slim arboreal animals and comprise the lorises, pottos and angwantibos.  Lorisids live in tropical, central Africa as well as in south and southeast Asia. Physical characteristicsLorisids have a close, woolly fur, which is usually grey or brown, darker on the top side.  The eyes are large and face forward.  The ears are small and often partially hidden in the fur.  The thumbs are opposable and the index finger is short.  The second toe of the hind legs has a fine claw for grooming, typical for strepsirrhines. 

Lysergic acid diethylamide<====>17537<====>Lysergic acid diethylamideLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), also known as acid, is a psychedelic drug known for its psychological effects, which may include altered awareness of one's surroundings, perceptions, and feelings as well as sensations and images that seem real though they are not.It is used mainly as a recreational drug and for spiritual reasons.  LSD is typically either swallowed or held under the tongue.   It is often sold on blotter paper, a sugar cube, or gelatin.  It can also be injected.  LSD is not usually addictive. 

Linnaean taxonomy<====>17539<====>Linnaean taxonomy Linnaean taxonomy can mean either of two related concepts: the particular form of biological classification (taxonomy) set up by Carl Linnaeus, as set forth in his Systema Naturae (1735) and subsequent works.  In the taxonomy of Linnaeus there are three kingdoms, divided into classes, and they, in turn, into orders, genera (singular: genus), and species (singular: species), with an additional rank lower than species. a term for rank-based classification of organisms, in general.  That is, taxonomy in the traditional sense of the word: rank-based scientific classification.  This term is especially used as opposed to cladistic systematics, which groups organisms into clades. 

Lawyer<====>17541<====>Lawyer    A lawyer is a person who practices law, as a paralegal, advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor, solicitor, or chartered legal executive.   Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services. The role of the lawyer varies greatly across legal jurisdictions, and so it can be treated here in only the most general terms.   TerminologyIn practice, legal jurisdictions exercise their right to determine who is recognized as being a lawyer. 

Logrolling<====>17542<====>Logrolling   Logrolling is the trading of favors, or quid pro quo, such as vote trading by legislative members to obtain passage of actions of interest to each legislative member.   In an academic context, the Nuttall Encyclopedia describes logrolling as "mutual praise by authors of each other's work".  In organizational analysis, it refers to a practice in which different organizations promote each other's agendas, each in the expectation that the other will reciprocate. Concept and originThere are three types of logrolling:Logrolling in direct democracies: a few individuals vote openly, and votes are easy to trade, rearrange, and observe. 

Playing by ear<====>17544<====>Playing by ear Playing by ear is the ability of an instrumental musician to reproduce a piece of music they have heard, without having observed another musician play it or having seen the sheet music notation.   It is the most common way to learn to play a musical instrument in cultures and musical that do not use musical notation, such as by early Blues guitarists and pianists, Romani fiddlers and folk music guitarists.  Outside of the Suzuki method, playing by ear is less common in Western Classical music.  In this musical tradition, instrumentalists learn new pieces by reading the music notation. 

Louvre<====>17546<====>Louvre    The Louvre ( ),  or the Louvre Museum (   ), is the world's largest art museum and a historic monument in Paris, France.  A central landmark of the city, it is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the city's 1st arrondissement (district or ward).  Approximately 38,000 objects from prehistory to the 21st century are exhibited over an area of 72,735 square metres (782,910 square feet).

Love<====>17547<====>Love  Love encompasses a variety of different emotional and mental states, typically strongly and positively experienced, ranging from the deepest interpersonal affection to the simplest pleasure.  An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse differs from the love of food.  Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of strong attraction and personal attachment.  Oxford Illustrated American Dictionary (1998) + Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary (2000)  Love can also be a virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection—"the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another". 

Forever Changes<====>17549<====>Forever Changes Forever Changes is the third album by American rock band Love.  It was released by Elektra Records in November 1967 and would be the final album by the original band, as subsequent albums featured leader Arthur Lee backed by a variety of new players. Forever Changes failed to achieve commercial success when it was first released in 1967, but it has since become recognized as one of the finest albums to come out of the Summer of Love, ranking 40th on Rolling Stone magazine's 2003 list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time,  being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008 as well as being added to the National Recording Registry in 2012. 

Kepler's laws of planetary motion<====>17553<====>Kepler's laws of planetary motion In astronomy, Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three scientific laws describing the motion of planets around the Sun.  The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci. A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.  Bryant, Jeff; Pavlyk, Oleksandr.  "Kepler's Second Law", Wolfram Demonstrations Project.  Retrieved December 27, 2009.  The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. Most planetary orbits are nearly circular, and careful observation and calculation are required in order to establish that they are not perfectly circular. 

Laser<====>17556<====>Laser    A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation.  The term "laser" originated as an acronym for "light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation".The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H.  Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories, based on theoretical work by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow. A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light coherently, spatially and temporally.  Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography. 

Live action role-playing game<====>17560<====>Live action role-playing game  A live action role-playing game (LARP) is a form of role-playing game where the participants physically portray their characters.  (Tychsen et al.  2006:255) "LARPs can be viewed as forming a distinct category of RPG because of two unique features: (a) The players physically embody their characters, and (b) the game takes place in a physical frame.  Embodiment means that the physical actions of the player are regarded as those of the character.  Whereas in a RPG played by a group sitting around a table, players describe the actions of their characters (e. 

Lithium<====>17561<====>Lithium   Lithium (from  ) is a chemical element with symbol Li and atomic number 3.  It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal.  Under standard conditions, it is the lightest metal and the lightest solid element.  Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and is stored in mineral oil.  When cut open, it exhibits a metallic luster, but moist air corrodes it quickly to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish.  It never occurs freely in nature, but only in (usually ionic) compounds, such as pegmatitic minerals which were once the main source of lithium. 

Leni Riefenstahl<====>17562<====>Leni Riefenstahl  Helene Bertha Amalie "Leni" Riefenstahl ( ; 22 August 1902 – 8 September 2003) was a German film director, producer, screenwriter, editor, photographer, actress and dancer. Born in 1902, Leni Riefenstahl grew up in Germany with her brother Heinz (1905–1944), who was killed on the Eastern Front in World War II.  A talented swimmer and artist, she also became interested in dancing during her childhood, taking dancing lessons and performing across Europe. After seeing a promotional poster for the 1924 film Der Berg des Schicksals ("The Mountain of Destiny"), Riefenstahl was inspired to move into acting. 

Labatt Brewing Company<====>17565<====>Labatt Brewing Company Labatt Brewing Company Limited ( ) is a Belgian-owned Canadian beer company founded by John Kinder Labatt in 1847 in London, Ontario.  Labatt is the largest brewer in Canada.  In 1995, it was purchased by Belgian brewer Interbrew.  In 2004, Interbrew merged with Brazilian brewer AmBev to form InBev.  In 2008, InBev merged with American brewer Anheuser-Busch to form Anheuser-Busch InBev (abbreviated AB InBev), making Labatt Brewing part of Anheuser-Busch InBev.  On October 10, 2016, an over $100 billion merger between Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) and SABMiller closed.  Labatt is now part of the new company, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, which is trading as BUD on the New York Stock Exchange (ABI:BB in Brussels). 

Linear equation<====>17570<====>Linear equation  A linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and (the first power of) a single variable (however, different variables may occur in different terms).  A simple example of a linear equation with only one variable,  , may be written in the form:  , where   and   are constants and  .  The constants may be numbers, parameters, or even non-linear functions of parameters, and the distinction between variables and parameters may depend on the problem (for an example, see linear regression). 

Limousine liberal<====>17575<====>Limousine liberalLimousine liberal and latte liberal are pejorative American political terms used to illustrate hypocritical behavior by political liberals of upper class or upper middle class status; including calls for the use of mass transit while frequently using privately-owned luxury transportation, especially by limousines or private jets in the case of the extremely affluent,  claiming environmental consciousness but driving fuel inefficient sports cars or SUVs, attacking income inequality while being wealthy themselves, or ostensibly supporting public education while actually sending their children to private schools.  "Limousine liberal" is also a reference to celebrities who use their fame to influence others into agreeing with their political and societal points of view. 

Lewis and Clark Expedition<====>17615<====>Lewis and Clark Expedition   The Lewis and Clark Expedition from May 1804 to September 1806, also known as the Corps of Discovery Expedition, was the first American expedition to cross what is now the western portion of the United States.  It began near St.  Louis, made its way westward, and passed through the continental divide to reach the Pacific coast.  The Corps of Discovery comprised a selected group of U. S.  Army volunteers under the command of Captain Meriwether Lewis and his close friend, Second Lieutenant William Clark. President Thomas Jefferson commissioned the expedition shortly after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 to explore and to map the newly acquired territory, to find a practical route across the western half of the continent, and to establish an American presence in this territory before Britain and other European powers tried to claim it. 

Latitude<====>17616<====>Latitude  In geography, latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the north–south position of a point on the Earth's surface.  Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles.  Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run east–west as circles parallel to the equator.  Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth.  Without qualification the term latitude should be taken  to be the geodetic latitude as defined in the following sections.  Also defined are six auxiliary latitudes which are used in special applications. 

Longitude<====>17617<====>Longitude   Longitude (  or  , Australian and British also  ),   is a geographic coordinate that specifies the east-west position of a point on the Earth's surface.  It is an angular measurement, usually expressed in degrees and denoted by the Greek letter lambda (λ).  Meridians (lines running from the North Pole to the South Pole) connect points with the same longitude.  By convention, one of these, the Prime Meridian, which passes through the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, England, was allocated the position of zero degrees longitude.  The longitude of other places is measured as the angle east or west from the Prime Meridian, ranging from 0° at the Prime Meridian to +180° eastward and −180° westward. 

Linus Torvalds<====>17618<====>Linus Torvalds    Linus Benedict Torvalds ( ;   ; born December 28, 1969) is a Finnish-American software engineer  who is the creator, and for a long  time, principal developer of the Linux kernel, which became the kernel for operating systems such as the  Linux operating system, Android, and Chrome OS.  He also created the distributed revision control system Git and the diving logging and planning software Subsurface.  He was honored, along with Shinya Yamanaka, with the 2012 Millennium Technology Prize by the Technology Academy Finland "in recognition of his creation of a new open source operating system for computers leading to the widely used Linux kernel". 

Trade union<====>17626<====>Trade unionA trade union or trades union, also called a labour union (Canada) or labor union (US), is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals; such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, and/or attaining better wages, benefits (such as vacation, health care, and retirement), and working conditions through the increased bargaining power wielded by the creation of a monopoly of the workers.The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (  members) and negotiates labour contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. 

Louisiana Purchase<====>17628<====>Louisiana Purchase    The Louisiana Purchase (  "Sale of Louisiana") was the acquisition of the Louisiana territory (828,000 square miles or 2. 14 million km²) by the United States from France in 1803.  The U. S.  paid fifty million francs ($11,250,000 USD) and a cancellation of debts worth eighteen million francs ($3,750,000 USD) for a total of sixty-eight million francs ($15 million USD, or   ).  The Louisiana territory included land from fifteen present U. S.  states and two Canadian provinces.  The territory contained land that forms Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska; the portion of Minnesota west of the Mississippi River; a large portion of North Dakota; a large portion of South Dakota; the northeastern section of New Mexico; the northern portion of Texas; the area of Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado east of the Continental Divide; Louisiana west of the Mississippi River (plus New Orleans); and small portions of land within the present Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. 

Labor theory of value<====>17629<====>Labor theory of valueThe labor theory of value (LTV) is a theory of value that argues that the economic value of a good or service is determined by the total amount of socially necessary labor required to produce it, rather than by the use or pleasure its owner gets from it.  At present, this concept is usually associated with Marxian economics, although it is also used in the theories of earlier liberal economists such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo and later also in anarchist economics. Definitions of value and laborWhen speaking in terms of a labor theory of value, value, without any qualifying adjective should theoretically refer to the amount of labor necessary to produce a marketable commodity, including the labor necessary to develop any real capital used in the production. 

Lunar Society of Birmingham<====>17630<====>Lunar Society of Birmingham The Lunar Society of Birmingham was a dinner club and informal learned society of prominent figures in the Midlands Enlightenment, including industrialists, natural philosophers and intellectuals, who met regularly between 1765 and 1813 in Birmingham, England.   At first called the Lunar Circle, "Lunar Society" became the formal name by 1775.  The name arose because the society would meet during the full moon, as the extra light made the journey home easier and safer in the absence of street lighting.  The members cheerfully referred to themselves as "lunarticks", a pun on lunatics.  Venues included Erasmus Darwin's home in Lichfield, Matthew Boulton's home, Soho House, Bowbridge House in Derbyshire, and Great Barr Hall.

The country is made of three historical regions, Tripolitania, Fezzan and Cyrenaica.  With an area of almost  , Libya is the fourth largest country in Africa, and is the 16th largest country in the world. 

Letter game<====>17634<====>Letter game A letter game involves the exchange of written letters, or e-mails, between two or more participants.  The first player writes a letter in the voice of a newly created character; in this first letter, the writer should establish their own identity and that of their correspondent, should set the scene, and should explain why they and their correspondent must communicate in written fashion.  In subsequent letters, plot and character can be developed, but the writers should not talk about plot outside of the letters and the characters should never meet.  Letter games can be a writing exercise or a form of collaborative fiction. 

Law of noncontradiction<====>17636<====>Law of noncontradiction  In classical logic, the law of non-contradiction (LNC) (also known as the law of contradiction, principle of non-contradiction (PNC), or the principle of contradiction) states that contradictory statements cannot both be true in the same sense at the same time, e. g.  the two propositions "A is B " and "A is not B " are mutually exclusive.  It is the second of the three classic laws of thought. The principle was stated as a theorem of propositional logic by Russell and Whitehead in  Principia Mathematica as: \mathbf{*3\cdot24}.  \ \  \vdash. 

Law of excluded middle<====>17637<====>Law of excluded middle  In logic, the law of excluded middle (or the principle of excluded middle) states that for any proposition, either that proposition is true or its negation is true.  It is the third of the three classic laws of thought. The law is also known as the law (or principle) of the excluded third, in Latin principium tertii exclusi.  Another Latin designation for this law is tertium non datur: "no third [possibility] is given". The earliest known formulation is in Aristotle's discussion of the principle of non-contradiction, first proposed in On Interpretation,  where he says that of two contradictory propositions (i. 

Line of scrimmage<====>17640<====>Line of scrimmage  In American and Canadian football, a line of scrimmage is an imaginary transverse line (across the width of the football field) beyond which a team cannot cross until the next play has begun.   Its location is based on the spot where the ball is placed after the end of the most recent play and following the assessment of any penalty yards. A line of scrimmage is parallel to the goal lines and touches one edge of the ball where it sits on the ground prior to the snap.   Under NFL, NCAA, and NFHS rules, there are two lines of scrimmage at the outset of each play: one that restricts the offense and one that restricts the defense. 

Lateral pass<====>17641<====>Lateral passIn American football and Canadian football, a lateral pass or lateral (officially backward pass in American football and onside pass in Canadian football) occurs when the ball carrier throws the football to a teammate in a direction parallel to or away from the opponents' goal line.  A lateral pass is distinguished from a forward pass, in which the ball is thrown forward, towards the opposition's end zone.  In a lateral pass the ball is not advanced, but unlike a forward pass a lateral may be attempted from anywhere on the field by any player to any player at any time. 

Lavandula<====>17643<====>Lavandula    Lavandula (common name lavender) is a genus of 47 known species of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae.  It is native to the Old World and is found from Cape Verde and the Canary Islands, Europe across to northern and eastern Africa, the Mediterranean, southwest Asia to southeast India.  Many members of the genus are cultivated extensively in temperate climates as ornamental plants for garden and landscape use, for use as culinary herbs, and also commercially for the extraction of essential oils.  The most widely cultivated species, Lavandula angustifolia, is often referred to as lavender, and there is a color named for the shade of the flowers of this species. 

Lemon balm<====>17644<====>Lemon balm  Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis),  balm,  common balm,   or balm mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant in the mint family Lamiaceae and native to south-central Europe, the Mediterranean Basin, Iran, and Central Asia, but now naturalized in the Americas and elsewhere.  It grows to a maximum height of  .  The leaves have a mild lemon scent similar to mint.  During summer, small white flowers full of nectar appear.  It is not to be confused with bee balm (genus Monarda), although the white flowers attract bees, hence the genus Melissa (Greek for "honey bee"). 

Liliales<====>17646<====>Liliales  Liliales (older name: Lilia) is an order of monocotyledonous flowering plants in the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group and Angiosperm Phylogeny Web system, within the lilioid monocots.  This order of necessity includes the family Liliaceae.  The APG III system (2009) places this order in the monocot clade.  In APG III, the family Luzuriagaceae is combined with the family Alstroemeriaceae and the family Petermanniaceae is recognized.  Both the Lililiales order and the Liliaceae family have had a widely disputed history, with the circumscription varying greatly from one taxonomist to another.  Previous members of this order, which at one stage included most monocots with  conspicuous tepals and lacking starch in the endosperm are now distributed over three orders, Liliales, Dioscoreales and Asparagales, using predominantly molecular phylogenetics. 

Laurales<====>17647<====>Laurales The Laurales are an order of flowering plants.  They are magnoliids, related to the Magnoliales. The order includes about 2500-2800 species from 85-90 genera, which comprise seven families of trees and shrubs.  Most of the species are tropical and subtropical, though a few genera reach the temperate zone.   The best known species in this order are those of the Lauraceae (for example bay laurel, cinnamon, avocado, and Sassafras), and the ornamental shrub Calycanthus of the Calycanthaceae. The earliest lauraceous fossils are from the early Cretaceous.  It is possible that the ancient origin of this order is one of the reasons for its highly diverged morphology. 

Lamiales<====>17651<====>Lamiales  The Lamiales are an order in the asterid group of dicotyledonous flowering plants.  It includes about 23,810  species, 1,059 genera, and is divided into about 24 families.  Well-known or economically important members of this order include lavender, lilac, olive, jasmine, the ash tree, teak, snapdragon, sesame, psyllium, garden sage, and a number of table herbs such as mint, basil, and rosemary. DescriptionAlthough exceptions occur, species in this order typically have the following characteristics:superior ovary composed of two fused carpelsfour petals fused into a tubebilaterally symmetrical, often bilabiate corollasfour (or fewer) fertile stamensTaxonomyThe Lamiales previously had a restricted circumscription (e. 

Lee Harvey Oswald<====>17652<====>Lee Harvey Oswald    Lee Harvey Oswald (October 18, 1939 – November 24, 1963) was an American former Marine and Marxist who assassinated United States President John F.  Kennedy on November 22, 1963.  According to four federal government investigations and one municipal investigation, These were investigations by: the Federal Bureau of Investigation (1963), the Warren Commission (1964), the House Select Committee on Assassinations (1979), the Secret Service, and the Dallas Police Department.   Oswald shot and killed Kennedy from a sniper's nest as the President traveled by motorcade through Dealey Plaza in the city of Dallas, Texas. 

Lincoln, Nebraska<====>17653<====>Lincoln, Nebraska    Lincoln (pronounced  ) is the capital of the U. S.  state of Nebraska and the county seat of Lancaster County.  The city covers   with a population of 280,364 in 2016.   It is the second-most populous city in Nebraska and the 71st-largest in the United States.   The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area in the southeastern part of the state called the Lincoln Metropolitan and Lincoln-Beatrice Combined Statistical Areas.   The statistical area is home to 348,720 people, making it the 105th-largest combined statistical area in the United States. 

Letterboxing (hobby)<====>17654<====>Letterboxing (hobby)Letterboxing is an outdoor hobby that combines elements of orienteering, art, and puzzle solving.  Letterboxers hide small, weatherproof boxes in publicly accessible places (like parks) and distribute clues to finding the box in printed catalogs, on one of several web sites, or by word of mouth.  Individual letterboxes contain a notebook and a rubber stamp, preferably hand carved or custom made.   Finders make an imprint of the letterbox's stamp in their personal notebook, and leave an impression of their personal signature stamp on the letterbox's "visitors' book" or "logbook" — as proof of having found the box and letting other letterboxers know who has visited. 

Legal technicality<====>17658<====>Legal technicality The term legal technicality is a casual or colloquial phrase referring to a technical aspect of law.   The phrase is not a term of art in the law; it has no exact meaning, nor does it have a legal definition.  It implies that strict adherence to the letter of the law has prevented the spirit of the law from being enforced.  However, as a vague term, the definition of a technicality varies from person to person, and it is often simply used to denote any portion of the law that interferes with the  outcome desired by the user of the term. 

Lionhead Studios<====>17659<====>Lionhead Studios   Lionhead Studios Ltd.  was a British video game developer, formerly led by Peter Molyneux.  It was acquired by Microsoft Studios in April 2006.  Lionhead started as a breakaway from developer Bullfrog Productions, which was also founded by Molyneux.  Lionhead's first game was Black & White, a god game with elements of artificial life and strategy games.  Black & White was published by Electronic Arts in 2001.  Lionhead Studios is named after Mark Webley's hamster, which died not long after the naming of the studio. Black & White was followed up with the release of an expansion pack named Black & White: Creature Isle.

Leading question<====>17674<====>Leading question  In common law systems that rely on testimony by witnesses, a leading question or suggestive interrogation  is a question that suggests the particular answer or contains the information the examiner is looking to have confirmed.   Their use is restricted in eliciting testimony in court, to reduce the ability of the examiner to direct or influence the evidence presented.   Depending on the circumstances, leading questions can be objectionable or proper. Leading questions may often be answerable with a yes or no (though not all yes-no questions are leading).  The propriety of leading questions generally depends on the relationship of the witness to the party conducting the examination. 

Lithuania<====>17675<====>Lithuania Lithuania ( ;), officially the Republic of Lithuania ( ), is a country in the Baltic region of northern-eastern Europe.  One of the three Baltic states, it is situated along the southeastern shore of the Baltic Sea, to the east of Sweden and Denmark.  It is bordered by Latvia to the north, Belarus to the east and south, Poland to the south, and Kaliningrad Oblast (a Russian exclave) to the southwest.  Lithuania has an estimated population of 2. 8 million people  , and its capital and largest city is Vilnius. 

Relativist fallacy<====>17676<====>Relativist fallacy The relativist fallacy, also known as the subjectivist fallacy, is claiming that something is true for one person but not true for someone else.  The fallacy is supposed to rest on the law of noncontradiction.  The fallacy applies only to objective facts, or what are alleged to be objective facts, rather than to facts about personal tastes or subjective experiences, and only to facts regarded in the same sense and at the same time.  On this formulation, the very name "relativist fallacy" begs the question against anyone who earnestly (however mistakenly or not) holds that there are no "objective facts. 

False dilemma<====>17687<====>False dilemmaA false dilemma is a type of informal fallacy in which something is falsely claimed to be an "either/or" situation, when in fact there is at least one additional option.   A false dilemma can arise intentionally, when a fallacy is used in an attempt to force a choice or outcome.  The opposite of this fallacy is false compromise. The false dilemma fallacy can also arise simply by accidental omission of additional options rather than by deliberate deception.  For example "Stacey spoke out against capitalism, therefore she must be a communist" (she may be neither).  "Roger opposed an atheist argument against Christianity, so he must be a Christian" (When it's assumed the opposition by itself means he's a Christian). 

Loaded question<====>17688<====>Loaded questionA loaded question or complex question fallacy is a question that contains a controversial or unjustified assumption (e. g. , a presumption of guilt).  Aside from being an informal fallacy depending on usage, such questions may be used as a rhetorical tool: the question attempts to limit direct replies to be those that serve the questioner's agenda.   The traditional example is the question "Have you stopped beating your wife?" Whether the respondent answers yes or no, he will admit to having a wife and having beaten her at some time in the past.  Thus, these facts are presupposed by the question, and in this case an entrapment, because it narrows the respondent to a single answer, and the fallacy of many questions has been committed. 

Ignoratio elenchi<====>17689<====>Ignoratio elenchi  Ignoratio elenchi, also known as irrelevant conclusion,  is the informal fallacy of presenting an argument that may or may not be logically valid, but fails nonetheless to address the issue in question.   More colloquially, it is also known as missing the point. OverviewIgnoratio elenchi falls into the broad class of relevance fallacies.   It is one of the fallacies identified by Aristotle in his Organon.  In a broader sense he asserted that all fallacies are a form of ignoratio elenchi. The phrase ignoratio elenchi is  . 

Equivocation<====>17690<====>EquivocationIn logic, equivocation ('calling two different things by the same name') is an informal fallacy resulting from the use of a particular word/expression in multiple senses throughout an argument leading to a false conclusion. Abbott and Costello's "Who's on first?" routine is a well known example of equivocation.It is a type of ambiguity that stems from a phrase having two distinct meanings, not from the grammar or structure of the sentence.  Some examples of equivocation in syllogisms (a logical chain of reasoning) are below:Since only man [human] is rational,and no woman is a man [male],Therefore, no woman is rational. 

Sampling bias<====>17692<====>Sampling bias In statistics, sampling bias is a bias in which a sample is collected in such a way that some members of the intended population are less likely to be included than others.  It results in a biased sample, a non-random sample  of a population (or non-human factors) in which all individuals, or instances, were not equally likely to have been selected.    If this is not accounted for, results can be erroneously attributed to the phenomenon under study rather than to the method of sampling. Medical sources sometimes refer to sampling bias as ascertainment bias. 

No true Scotsman<====>17694<====>No true Scotsman No true Scotsman is a kind of informal fallacy in which one attempts to protect a universal generalization from counterexamples by changing the definition in an ad hoc fashion to exclude the counterexample.  No True Scotsman, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy   Rather than denying the counterexample or rejecting the original claim, this fallacy modifies the subject of the assertion to exclude the specific case or others like it by rhetoric, without reference to any specific objective rule ("no   Scotsman would do such a thing"; i. e. , those who perform that action are not part of our group and thus criticism of that action is not criticism of the group). 

Slippery slope<====>17696<====>Slippery slope A slippery slope argument (SSA), in logic, critical thinking, political rhetoric, and caselaw, is a consequentialist logical device    in which a party asserts that a relatively small first step leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant (usually negative) effect.   The core of the slippery slope argument is that a specific decision under debate is likely to result in unintended consequences.  The strength of such an argument depends on the warrant, i. e.  whether or not one can demonstrate a process that leads to the significant effect.  This type of argument is sometimes used as a form of fear mongering, in which the probable consequences of a given action are exaggerated in an attempt to scare the audience. 

Argument from ignorance<====>17699<====>Argument from ignorance Argument from ignorance (from  ), also known as appeal to ignorance (in which ignorance represents "a lack of contrary evidence") is a fallacy in informal logic.  It asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false or a proposition is false because it has not yet been proven true.   This represents a type of false dichotomy in that it excludes a third option, which is that there may have been an insufficient investigation, and therefore there is insufficient information to prove the proposition be either true or false. 

Leo (constellation)<====>17703<====>Leo (constellation) Leo   is one of the constellations of the zodiac, lying between Cancer the crab to the west and Virgo the maiden to the east.  Its name is Latin for lion, and to the ancient Greeks represented the Nemean Lion killed by the mythical Greek hero [[Hercules))(known to the ancient Romans as Hercules) as one of his twelve labors.  Its symbol is  (Unicode ♌).  One of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, Leo remains one of the 88 modern constellations today, and one of the most easily recognizable due to its many bright stars and a distinctive shape that is reminiscent of the crouching lion it depicts. 

Libra (constellation)<====>17704<====>Libra (constellation)  Libra   is a constellation of the zodiac.  Its name is Latin for weighing scales, and its symbol is  (Unicode ♎).  It is fairly faint, with no first magnitude stars, and lies between Virgo to the west and Scorpius to the east.  Beta Librae, also known as Zubeneschamali, is the brightest star in the constellation.  Three star systems are known to have planets. History and mythologyLibra was known in Babylonian astronomy as MUL Zibanu (the "scales" or "balance"), or alternatively as the Claws of the Scorpion.  The scales were held sacred to the sun god Shamash, who was also the patron of truth and justice. 

Roxen<====>17714<====>Roxen  Roxen is a medium-sized lake in south central Sweden, east of lake Vättern, part of the waterpath Motala ström and the Göta Canal. South of lake Roxen is the city Linköping.Roxen, especially the western parts, is very good for bird watching. There are natural reserves at Kungsbro  and Svartåmynningen. The lake develops in a graben depression. References  

Locomotive<====>17717<====>Locomotive   A locomotive or engine is a rail transport vehicle that provides the motive power for a train.  A locomotive has no payload capacity of its own, and its sole purpose is to move the train along the tracks.   In contrast, some trains have self-propelled payload-carrying vehicles.  These are not normally considered locomotives , and may be referred to as multiple units, motor coaches or railcars.  The use of these self-propelled vehicles is increasingly common for passenger trains, but rare for freight (see CargoSprinter).  Vehicles which provide motive power to haul an unpowered train, but are not generally considered locomotives because they have payload space or are rarely detached from their trains, are known as power cars. 

Lars Magnus Ericsson<====>17719<====>Lars Magnus Ericsson  Lars Magnus Ericsson ( ; 5 May 1846 – 17 December 1926) was a Swedish inventor, entrepreneur and founder of telephone equipment manufacturer Ericsson (incorporated as Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson). Lars Magnus was born in Värmskog, Värmland, and grew up in the small village of Vegerbol located between Karlstad and Arvika.  At the age of 12, Ericsson's father died forcing him to seek work as a miner.  He worked until he had money enough to leave the village and move to Stockholm in 1867.  He then worked for six years for an instrument maker named Öllers & Co. 

Lysator<====>17721<====>Lysator Lysator is an academic computer club at Linköping University, Sweden with almost 600 members.  It is an independent non-profit society, separate from the students' union and the faculties of the university. HistoryLysator was founded on 29 March 1973.  The first computer used at Lysator was a Datasaab D21, delivered to Lysator on 25 May 1973.  Later in the decade, members of Lysator developed and initially built a microcomputer, the Lys-16, which was advanced for its time due to its 16-bit word size.  In February 1993, Lysator put up the first web server in Sweden, among the first 10–15 in the world. 

Latin hip hop<====>17722<====>Latin hip hopLatin hip hop or Latin rap is hip hop music recorded by Latin American artists in the U. S.  and Spanish speaking countries in the Caribbean, Central American and South America. Latino hip hop in the U. S. Latin rap on the West CoastIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, most Latin rap came from the West Coast of the United States.  Cuban-American artist Mellow Man Ace was the first Latino artist to have a major bilingual single attached to his 1989 debut.  Mellow Man, referred to as the "Godfather of Latin rap" and a Hip Hop Hall of Fame inductee, brought mainstream attention to Spanglish rhyming with his 1989 platinum single "Mentirosa". 

Lighthouse of Alexandria<====>17724<====>Lighthouse of Alexandria   The Lighthouse of Alexandria, sometimes called the Pharos of Alexandria ( ; Ancient Greek: ὁ Φάρος τῆς Ἀλεξανδρείας, contemporary Koine  ), was a lighthouse built by the Ptolemaic Kingdom between 280 and 247 BC which has been estimated to be 100 metres in overall height.   One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, for many centuries it was one of the tallest man-made structures in the world.  Badly damaged by three earthquakes between AD 956 and 1323, it then became an abandoned ruin.  It was the third longest surviving ancient wonder (after the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus and the extant Great Pyramid of Giza) until 1480, when the last of its remnant stones were used to build the Citadel of Qaitbay on the site. 

Lighthouse<====>17725<====>Lighthouse A lighthouse is a tower, building, or other type of structure designed to emit light from a system of lamps and lenses, and to serve as a navigational aid for maritime pilots at sea or on inland waterways.  Lighthouses mark dangerous coastlines, hazardous shoals, reefs, and safe entries to harbors, and can assist in aerial navigation.   Once widely used, the number of operational lighthouses has declined due to the expense of maintenance and use of electronic navigational systems. History Ancient lighthouses Before the development of clearly defined ports, mariners were guided by fires built on hilltops. 

Library of Alexandria<====>17726<====>Library of Alexandria   The Royal Library of Alexandria or Ancient Library of Alexandria in Alexandria, Egypt, was one of the largest and most significant libraries of the ancient world.  It was dedicated to the Muses, the nine goddesses of the arts.   It flourished under the patronage of the Ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship from its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC, with collections of works, lecture halls, meeting rooms, and gardens.  The library was part of a larger research institution called the Musaeum of Alexandria, where many of the most famous thinkers of the ancient world studied. 

Library<====>17727<====>Library   A library is a collection of sources of information and similar resources, made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing.   It provides physical or digital access to material, and may be a physical building or room, or a virtual space, or both.   A library's collection can include books, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, films, maps, prints, documents, microform, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books, audiobooks, databases, and other formats.  Libraries range in size from a few shelves of books to several million items.  In Latin and Greek, the idea of a bookcase is represented by Bibliotheca and Bibliothēkē (Greek: βιβλιοθήκη): derivatives of these mean library in many modern languages, e. 

Line Islands<====>17728<====>Line Islands    The Line Islands, Teraina Islands or Equatorial Islands, is a chain of atolls (with partially or fully enclosed lagoons) and coral islands (with a surrounding reef).  Kingman Reef is a largely submerged and Filippo Reef is shown on some maps, although its existence is doubted.  The islands were formed by volcanic activity and are located in the central Pacific Ocean, south of the Hawaiian Islands.  The 11 islands stretch for   in a northwest–southeast direction, making it one of the longest island chains of the world.  Eight of the islands form part of Kiribati, while the remaining three are United States territories grouped with the United States Minor Outlying Islands. 

Latin<====>17730<====>Latin    Latin (Latin:  ,  ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages.  The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets, and ultimately from the Phoenician alphabet. Latin was originally spoken in Latium, in the Italian Peninsula.   Through the power of the Roman Republic, it became the dominant language, initially in Italy and subsequently throughout the Roman Empire.  Vulgar Latin developed into the Romance languages, such as Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, French, and Romanian.  Latin and French have contributed many words to the English language. 

LiveScript<====>17731<====>LiveScript    LiveScript is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript.  It was created by Jeremy Ashkenas—the creator of CoffeeScript—along with Satoshi Muramaki, George Zahariev, and many others.   Notably, LiveScript was briefly the name of JavaScript in 1990s.  SyntaxLiveScript is an indirect descendant of and partly compatible with CoffeeScript.   The following is a fully Coffeescript-compatible hello-world example of LiveScript syntax.  hello = -> console. log 'hello, world!' While calling a function can be done with empty parens,  hello() , LiveScript treats the exclamation mark as a single-character shorthand for function calls with zero arguments:  hello! LiveScript introduces a number of other incompatible idioms:Name manglingAt compile time, the LiveScript parser implicitly converts kebab case (dashed variables and function names) to camelcase. 

Local area network<====>17739<====>Local area network  A local area network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building.   By contrast, a wide area network (WAN) not only covers a larger geographic distance, but also generally involves leased telecommunication circuits. Ethernet and Wi-Fi are the two most common technologies in use for local area networks.  Historical technologies include ARCNET, Token ring, and AppleTalk. HistoryThe increasing demand and use of computers in universities and research labs in the late 1960s generated the need to provide high-speed interconnections between computer systems. 

Louis Pasteur<====>17740<====>Louis Pasteur  Louis Pasteur ( ,  ; December 27, 1822 – September 28, 1895) was a French biologist, microbiologist and chemist renowned for his discoveries of the principles of vaccination, microbial fermentation and pasteurization.  He is remembered for his remarkable breakthroughs in the causes and prevention of diseases, and his discoveries have saved many lives ever since.  He reduced mortality from puerperal fever, and created the first vaccines for rabies and anthrax.  His medical discoveries provided direct support for the germ theory of disease and its application in clinical medicine. 

Ludwig Wittgenstein<====>17741<====>Ludwig Wittgenstein    Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein ( ;   ; 26 April 1889 – 29 April 1951) was an Austrian-British philosopher who worked primarily in logic, the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of language.From 1929 to 1947, Wittgenstein taught at the University of Cambridge.  Dennett, Daniel.  "Ludwig Wittgenstein: Philosopher", Time magazine, 29 March 1999.   During his lifetime he published just one slim book, the 75-page Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921),  one article, one book review and a children's dictionary.   His voluminous manuscripts were edited and published posthumously. 

West Low German<====>17743<====>West Low German   West Low German, also known as Low Saxon (  or  ; literally:  ;  ;  ; ) is a group of Low German (also Low Saxon; German: Niederdeutsch or Plattdeutsch, Dutch: Nederduits) dialects spoken in parts of the Netherlands, northwestern Germany and southern Denmark (in North Schleswig by the German minority).  It is one of two groups of mutually intelligible dialects, the other being East Low German dialects. ExtentThe language area comprises the North German states of Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia (the Westphalian part), Bremen, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein and Saxony-Anhalt (the northwestern areas around Magdeburg) as well as the northeast of The Netherlands (i. 

Lanthanum<====>17744<====>Lanthanum Lanthanum is a chemical element with symbol La and atomic number 57.  It is a soft, ductile, silvery-white metal that tarnishes rapidly when exposed to air and is soft enough to be cut with a knife.  It is the eponym of the lanthanide series, a group of 15 similar elements between lanthanum and lutetium in the periodic table, of which lanthanum is the first and the prototype.  It is also sometimes considered the first element of the 6th-period transition metals and is traditionally counted among the rare earth elements.  The usual oxidation state is +3. 

Lutetium<====>17745<====>Lutetium Lutetium is a chemical element with symbol Lu and atomic number 71.  It is a silvery white metal, which resists corrosion in dry air, but not in moist air.  Lutetium is the last element in the lanthanide series, and it is traditionally counted among the rare earths.  Lutetium is sometimes considered the first element of the 6th-period transition metals, although lanthanum is more often considered as such. Lutetium was independently discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James.  All of these researchers found lutetium as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia, which was previously thought to consist entirely of ytterbium. 

Lawrencium<====>17746<====>Lawrencium  Lawrencium is a synthetic chemical element with symbol Lr (formerly Lw) and atomic number 103.  It is named in honor of Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron, a device that was used to discover many artificial radioactive elements.  A radioactive metal, lawrencium is the eleventh transuranic element and is also the final member of the actinide series.  Like all elements with atomic number over 100, lawrencium can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles.  Twelve isotopes of lawrencium are currently known; the most stable is  266 Lr with a half-life of 11 hours, but the shorter-lived  260 Lr (half-life 2. 

Lead<====>17747<====>Lead    Lead is a chemical element with symbol Pb (from the Latin plumbum) and atomic number 82.  It is a heavy metal that is denser than most common materials.  Lead is soft and malleable, and has a relatively low melting point.  When freshly cut, lead is bluish-white; it tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air.  Lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element and concludes three major decay chains of heavier elements. Lead is a relatively unreactive post-transition metal.  Its weak metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature; lead and lead oxides react with acids and bases, and it tends to form covalent bonds. 

Limestone<====>17748<====>Limestone   Limestone is a sedimentary rock, composed mainly of skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral, forams and molluscs.  Its major materials are the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones.   The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years.  Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock. Limestone has numerous uses: as a building material, an essential component of concrete (Portland cement), as aggregate for the base of roads, as white pigment or filler in products such as toothpaste or paints, as a chemical feedstock for the production of lime, as a soil conditioner, or as a popular decorative addition to rock gardens. 

Lübeck<====>17750<====>Lübeck    Lübeck ( ) is a city in Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany, and one of the major ports of Germany.   On the river Trave, it was the leading city of the Hanseatic League, and because of its extensive Brick Gothic architecture, it is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.  In 2015, it had a population of 218,523. The old part of Lübeck is on an island enclosed by the Trave.  The Elbe–Lübeck Canal connects the Trave with the Elbe River.  Another important river near the town centre is the Wakenitz.  Autobahn 1 connects Lübeck with Hamburg and Denmark. 

Laos<====>17752<====>Laos  Laos ( ,   ;    ,  , Lāo), officially the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao: ສາທາລະນະລັດ ປະຊາທິປະໄຕ ປະຊາຊົນລາວ, Sathalanalat Paxathipatai Paxaxon Lao), commonly referred to by its colloquial name of Muang Lao (Lao: ເມືອງລາວ, Muang Lao), is a landlocked country in the heart of the Indochinese peninsula of Mainland Southeast Asia, bordered by Myanmar (Burma) and China to the northwest, Vietnam to the east, Cambodia to the southwest and Thailand to the west and southwest.  Present day Lao PDR traces its historic and cultural identity to the kingdom of Lan Xang Hom Khao (Kingdom of a Million Elephants Under the White Parasol), which existed for four centuries as one of the largest kingdoms in Southeast Asia. 

History of Laos<====>17753<====>History of Laos  Evidence for modern human presence in the northern and central highlands of Indochina, that constitute the territories of the modern Laotian nation-state dates back to the Lower Paleolithic.These earliest human migrants are Australo-Melanesians - associated with the Hoabinhian culture and have popülated the highlands and the interior, less accessible regions of Laos and all of South-east Asia to this day.  The subsequent Austroasiatic and Austronesian marine migration waves affected landlocked Laos only marginally and direct Chinese and Indian cultural contact had a greater impact on the country.  Pittayaporn, Pittayawat (2014). 

Geography of Laos<====>17754<====>Geography of LaosLaos is an independent republic, and a landlocked nation in Southeast Asia, northeast of Thailand, west of Vietnam.  It covers 236,800 square kilometers in the center of the Southeast Asian peninsula and it is surrounded by Burma (Myanmar), Cambodia, the People's Republic of China, Thailand, and Vietnam.  About seventy percent of its geographic area is made up of mountain ranges, highlands, plateaux, and rivers cut through. Its location has often made it a buffer between more powerful neighboring states, as well as a crossroads for trade and communication.  Migration and international conflict have contributed to the present ethnic composition of the country and to the geographic distribution of its ethnic groups.

Demographics of Liberia<====>17794<====>Demographics of Liberia The demographics of Liberia are examined on this page, including Liberia's population density, ethnic groups, education level, population health, economic status, religious affiliations and other demographic information. As of 2006, Liberia has the highest population growth rate in the world (4. 50% per annum).43. 5% of Liberians were below the age of 15 in 2010.  With recent civil wars being fought along ethnic lines, Liberia is a multiethnic and multicultural country.  Diversity has always been celebrated in Liberian culture - ethnically based civil wars aside - in regard to cuisine, music, fashion, language and people. 

Politics of Liberia<====>17795<====>Politics of Liberia  Politics of Liberia takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic modeled on the government of the United States, whereby the President is the head of state and head of government; unlike the United States, however, Liberia is a unitary state as opposed to a federation and has a pluriform   rather than the two-party system that characterizes US politics.  Executive power is exercised by the government.  Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the legislature. Liberia is still in transition from dictatorship and civil war to democracy. 

Economy of Liberia<====>17796<====>Economy of Liberia Liberia is one of the poorest countries in the world, and its economy is extremely underdeveloped, largely due to the First Liberian Civil War in 1989-96.  The civil war destroyed much of Liberia's economy, especially the infrastructure in and around Monrovia.  The war also caused a brain drain and the loss of capital, as the civil war involved overthrowing the Americo-Liberian minority that ruled the country.  Some returned during 1997, but many have not. Richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture, but poor in human capital, infrastructure, and stability, Liberia has a fairly typical profile for Sub-Saharan African economies – the majority of the population is reliant on subsistence agriculture, while exports are dominated by raw commodities such as rubber and iron ore. 

Communications in Liberia<====>17797<====>Communications in LiberiaCommunications in Liberia include the press, radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet. Much of Liberia's communications infrastructure was destroyed or plundered during the two civil wars (1989-1996 and 1999-2003).   With low rates of adult literacy and high poverty rates, television and newspaper use is limited, leaving radio as the predominant means of communicating with the public.  Even as it struggles with economic and political constraints, Liberia’s media environment is expanding.  The number of registered newspapers and radio stations (many of them community stations) is on the rise despite limited market potential. 

Transport in Liberia<====>17798<====>Transport in Liberia  Transport in Liberia consist of railways, highways, seaports and airports. Railways Historically, three railways were built in Liberia to export ore from mines; they were damaged during civil war, and as of August 2010 only one had been brought back into service. There are no rail connections with other countries, although there has been a proposal to extend the Bong mine railway to serve a mine across the border in Guinea. HighwaysTotal:10,600 km (6,586 mi) (there is major deterioration on all highways due to heavy rains and lack of maintenance)Paved:657 km (408 mi)Unpaved:9,943 km (6,178 mi) (1996 est. )When construction and reconstruction of roads in Liberia is complete, the Trans–West African Coastal Highway will cross the country, connecting it to Freetown (Sierra Leone), Abidjan (Ivory Coast), and eventually to 11 other nations of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). 

Armed Forces of Liberia<====>17799<====>Armed Forces of Liberia  The Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) are the armed forces of the Republic of Liberia.  Tracing its origins to a militia that was formed by the first black colonists in what is now Liberia, it was founded as the Liberian Frontier Force in 1908, and retitled in 1956.  For almost all of its history, the AFL has received considerable materiel and training assistance from the United States.  For most of the 1941–89 period, training was largely provided by U. S.  advisers, though this assistance has not prevented the same generally low levels of effectiveness common to most of the armed forces in the developing world. 

Foreign relations of Liberia<====>17800<====>Foreign relations of Liberia Liberian foreign relations were traditionally stable and cordial throughout much of the 19th and 20th centuries.   During the 1990s, Charles Taylor's presidency and the First and Second Liberian Civil Wars underscored Liberian relations with the Western world, the People's Republic of China, and its neighboring countries in Western Africa.  Stabilization in the 21st century brought a return to cordial relations with neighboring countries and much of the Western world.  Liberia holds diplomatic relations with many western nations, as well as Libya, Cuba, and the People's Republic of China. Liberian-African relationsSierra Leone and GuineaThe First Liberian Civil War, instigated by Charles Taylor and the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) on December 24, 1989, eventually spread to neighboring Sierra Leone in 1991 when dissidents of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), led by Foday Sankoh, began using Liberia as a staging ground for NPFL backed military assaults on border towns in Sierra Leone. 

Geography of Libya<====>17802<====>Geography of LibyaLibya is fourth in size among the countries of Africa and seventeenth among the countries of the world.  It is on the Mediterranean between Egypt and Tunisia, with Niger and Chad to the south and Sudan to the southeast.  Although the oil discoveries of the 1960s have brought immense wealth, at the time of its independence it was an extremely poor desert state whose only important physical asset appeared to be its strategic location at the midpoint of Africa's northern rim.  Libya lay within easy reach of the major European nations and linked the Arab countries of North Africa with those of the Middle East, facts that throughout history had made its urban centres bustling crossroads rather than isolated backwaters without external social influences. 

Demographics of Libya<====>17803<====>Demographics of Libya Demographics of Libya  include population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the Libyan population.  No complete population or vital statistics registration exists in Libya.   Of the over 6,000,000 Libyans that lived in Libya prior to the Libyan Crisis, more than a million were immigrants.   The estimates in this article are from   which was prepared by the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, unless otherwise indicated.  The Libyan population resides in the country of Libya, a territory located on the Mediterranean coast of North Africa, to the west of and adjacent to Egypt. 

Politics of Libya<====>17804<====>Politics of Libya   The Politics of Libya is in an uncertain state due to the collapse of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya in 2011 and an ongoing civil war between the Council of Deputies in Tobruk and its supporters, the New General National Congress in Tripoli and its supporters, and various jihadists and tribal elements controlling parts of the country.  Libyan Political Agreement (2015)Members of the House of Representatives and the New General National Congress signed a political agreement on 18 December 2015.  https://www. theguardian. com/world/2015/dec/17/libyan-politicians-sign-un-peace-deal-unify-rival-governments  Under the terms of the agreement, a nine-member Presidential Council and a seventeen-member interim Government of National Accord was formed, with a view to holding new elections within two years. 

Economy of Libya<====>17805<====>Economy of Libya  The Economy of Libya depends primarily upon revenues from the petroleum sector, which contributes practically all export earnings and over half of GDP.  These oil revenues and a small population have given Libya the highest nominal per capita GDP in Africa.  After 2000, Libya recorded favourable growth rates with an estimated 10. 6% growth of GDP in 2010.  This development was interrupted by the Libyan Civil War, which resulted in contraction of the economy by 62. 1% in 2011.  After the war the economy rebounded by 104. 5% in 2012, but it has yet to achieve its pre-war level. 

Communications in Libya<====>17806<====>Communications in Libya  Communications in Libya describes the overall environment for the radio, television, telephone, Internet, and newspaper markets in Libya. The control of the media by Colonel Gaddafi's regime came to an end after the fall of Tripoli in August 2011, resulting in a mushrooming of new media outlets.  Journalists are still experiencing extortion and blackmail, and are subject to assassinations since the beginning of the second civil war circa 2012 - 2016.  Libya has adopted a few media laws outlawing the slander of the 17th February revolution, and active political parties that used to have affiliation with Gaddafi. 

Transport in Libya<====>17807<====>Transport in LibyaRailways Libya has had no railway in operation since 1965, all previous narrow gauge lines having been dismantled.  Plans for a new network have been under development for some time (earthworks were begun between Sirte and Ras Ajdir, Tunisia border, in 2001-5),    and in 2008 and 2009 various contracts were placed and construction work started on a   standard gauge railway parallel to the coast from the Tunisian border at Ras Ajdir to Tripoli, and on to Misrata, Sirte, Benghazi and Bayda.  Another railway line will run inland from Misrata to Sabha at the centre of a mineral-rich area. 

Armed Forces of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya<====>17808<====>Armed Forces of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  The Armed Forces of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya consisted of the Libyan Army, Libyan Air Force and the Libyan Navy and other services including the People's Militia.  In November 2010, before the Libyan Civil War in 2011, the total number of Libyan personnel was estimated at 76,000  though that war wore the military's numbers away.  There was no separate defence ministry; all defence activities were centralised under Gaddafi.  There was a High Command of the Armed Forces (al-Qiyada al-ulya lil-quwwat al-musallaha).   Arms production was limited and manufacturers were state-owned.

For the foreign relations of the current de facto Libyan government, see Foreign relations of Libya.  The foreign relations of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1969–2011) underwent much fluctuation and change.  They were marked by severe tension with the West (especially the United States, although relations were normalised in the early 21st century prior to the Libyan Civil War) and by other national policies in the Middle East and Africa, including the Libyan government's financial and military support for numerous paramilitary and rebel groups.

Opened in 1863, it is now part of the Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines; the first line to operate underground electric traction trains, the City & South London Railway in 1890, is now part of the Northern line. 

Large technical system<====>17841<====>Large technical system A large technical system (LTS) is a system or network of enormous proportions or complexity.  The study of LTSs is a subdiscipline of history of science and technology.The book Rescuing Prometheus by Thomas P. Hughes documents the development of four such systems, including the Boston central artery tunnel and the Internet.References   

Lund University<====>17843<====>Lund University Lund University ( ) is one of Europe's oldest, largest and most prestigious universities,  Lund University, The Solander Program Website   consistently ranking among the world's top 100 universities. The university, located in the city of Lund in the province of Scania, Sweden, traces its roots back to 1425, when a Franciscan studium generale was founded in Lund next to the Lund Cathedral, making it the oldest institution of higher education in Scandinavia.  After Sweden won Scania from Denmark in the 1658 Treaty of Roskilde, the university was founded in 1666 on the location of the old studium generale next to Lund Cathedral. 

Lord Peter Wimsey<====>17844<====>Lord Peter Wimsey   Lord Peter Death  Bredon Wimsey   is the fictional protagonist in a series of detective novels and short stories by Dorothy L.  Sayers (and their continuation by Jill Paton Walsh).  A dilettante who solves mysteries for his own amusement, Wimsey is an archetype for the British gentleman detective.  Lord Peter is often assisted by his valet and former batman, Mervyn Bunter; his good friend and later brother-in-law, police detective Charles Parker; and in a few books by Harriet Vane, who becomes his wife. BiographyBackgroundBorn in 1890 and ageing in real time, Wimsey is described as being of average height, with straw-coloured hair, a beaked nose, and a vaguely foolish face. 

Letter (message)<====>17845<====>Letter (message)  A letter is one person's written message to another pertaining to some matter of common concern.   Letters can serve several purposes: when intimates are forced to spend time at great distances from one another, letters allow them to maintain the relationship; rulers, scholars, merchants, officials, and professionals use them to conduct affairs with their far-flung correspondents; poets and other writers may also use them as vehicles for  self-expression.  Letters contribute to the protection and conservation of literacy.Letters have been sent since antiquity and are mentioned in the Iliad. 

Lesbian<====>17846<====>Lesbian    A lesbian is a homosexual woman who is romantically or sexually attracted to other women.Zimmerman, p.  453.   The term lesbian is also used to express sexual identity or sexual behavior regardless of sexual orientation, or as an adjective to characterize or associate nouns with female homosexuality or same-sex attraction.The concept of "lesbian", to differentiate women with a shared sexual orientation, is a 20th-century construct.  Throughout history, women have not had the same freedom or independence to pursue homosexual relationships as men, but neither have they met the same harsh punishment as homosexual men in some societies.

Lambda<====>17851<====>Lambda    Lambda, Λ, λ (uppercase  , lowercase  ;   lám(b)da) is the 11th letter of the Greek alphabet.  In the system of Greek numerals lambda has a value of 30.  Lambda is related to the Phoenician letter Lamed .  Letters in other alphabets that stemmed from lambda include the Latin L and the Cyrillic letter El (Л, л).  The ancient grammarians and dramatists give evidence to the pronunciation as   ( ) in Classical Greek times.   In Modern Greek the name of the letter, Λάμδα, is pronounced  ; the spoken letter itself has the sound of " " as with Latinate "L". 

Lamiaceae<====>17856<====>Lamiaceae Lamiaceae (or   )or Labiatae is a family of flowering plants commonly known as the mint or deadnettle family.  Many of the plants are aromatic in all parts and include widely used culinary herbs, such as basil, mint, rosemary, sage, savory, marjoram, oregano, hyssop, thyme, lavender, and perilla.  Some species are shrubs, trees (such as teak), or, rarely, vines.   Many members of the family are widely cultivated, not only for their aromatic qualities but also their ease of cultivation, since they are readily propagated by stem cuttings.   Besides those grown for their edible leaves, some are grown for decorative foliage, such as Coleus. 

Long shot<====>17859<====>Long shot In photography, filmmaking and video production, a long shot (sometimes referred to as a full shot or, and to remove ambiguity, wide shot) typically shows the entire object or human figure and is usually intended to place it in some relation to its surroundings.  These are typically shot now using wide-angle cameras (approximately a 25 mm lens in 35 mm photography and a 10 mm lens in 16 mm photography. )   However, due to the sheer distance establishing shots and extreme wide shots can use almost any camera type. HistoryThis type of filmmaking was a result of filmmakers trying to retain the sense of the viewer watching a play in front of them, as opposed to just a series of pictures. 

Logarithm<====>17860<====>LogarithmIn mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation, just as division is the inverse of multiplication and vice versa.  That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base, must be raised to produce that number.  In the most simple case the logarithm counts repeated multiplication of the same factor; e. g. , since  , the "logarithm to base  " of   is  .   More generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers   and   where   is not equal to  . 

L. Ron Hubbard<====>17862<====>L.  Ron HubbardLafayette Ronald "L.  Ron" Hubbard, (March 13, 1911 – January 24, 1986) (   )    often referred to by his initials LRH, was an American author and the founder of the Church of Scientology.  After establishing a career as a writer, becoming best known for his science fiction and fantasy stories, he developed a system called Dianetics which was first expounded in book form in May 1950.  He subsequently developed his ideas into a wide-ranging set of doctrines and practices as part of a new religious movement that he called Scientology. 

Luddite<====>17864<====>Luddite    The Luddites were a group of English textile workers and weavers in the 19th century who destroyed weaving machinery as a form of protest.  The group was protesting the use of machinery in a "fraudulent and deceitful manner" to get around standard labour practices.    Luddites feared that the time spent learning the skills of their craft would go to waste as machines would replace their role in the industry.   It is a misconception that the Luddites protested against the machinery itself in an attempt to halt the progress of technology. 

Anarcho-communism<====>17865<====>Anarcho-communism    Anarcho-communism (also known as anarchist communism,  free communism, libertarian communism and communist anarchism)   is a theory of anarchism which advocates the abolition of the state, capitalism, wage labour and private property (while retaining respect for personal property)  and in favor of common ownership of the means of production,direct democracy and a horizontal network of workers' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need".   Some forms of anarchist communism, such as insurrectionary anarchism, are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism, believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realization of individual freedom. 

London<====>17867<====>London London   is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom.    Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia.  It was founded by the Romans, who named it Londinium.London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its   medieval boundaries.  Since at least the 19th century, "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent and Hertfordshire,    which today largely makes up Greater London,  See also: Independent city § National capitals. 

Lagâri Hasan Çelebi<====>17869<====>Lagâri Hasan Çelebi Lagâri Hasan Çelebi was an Ottoman aviator who, according to a sole account written by traveller Evliya Çelebi, made a successful manned rocket flight. AccountEvliya Çelebi reported that in 1633, Lagari Hasan Çelebi launched in a 7-winged rocket using 50 okka (140 lbs) of gunpowder from Sarayburnu, the point below Topkapı Palace in Istanbul.  The flight was said to be undertaken at the time of the birth of sultan Murad IV's daughter.  As Evliya Celebi wrote, Lagari proclaimed before launch "O my sultan! Be blessed, I am going to talk to Jesus!"; after ascending in the rocket, he landed in the sea, swimming ashore and joking "O my sultan! Jesus sends his regards to you!"; he was rewarded by the Sultan with silver and the rank of sipahi in the Ottoman army. 

Letterboxing (filming)<====>17871<====>Letterboxing (filming)  Letterboxing is the practice of transferring film shot in a widescreen aspect ratio to standard-width video formats while preserving the film's original aspect ratio.   The resulting videographic image has mattes (black bars) above and below it; these mattes are part of the image (i. e. , of each frame of the video signal).   LBX or LTBX are the identifying abbreviations for films and images so formatted.  The term refers to the shape of a letter box, a slot in a wall or door through which mail is delivered, being rectangular and wider than it is high.

Ligament<====>17874<====>Ligament A ligament is the fibrous connective tissue that connects bones to other bones.  It is also known as articular ligament, articular larua,  fibrous ligament, or true ligament.  Other ligaments in the body include the:Peritoneal ligament: a fold of peritoneum or other membranes. Fetal remnant ligament: the remnants of a fetal tubular structure. Periodontal ligament: a group of fibers that attach the cementum of teeth to the surrounding alveolar bone. Ligaments are similar to tendons and fasciae as they are all made of connective tissue.  The differences in them are in the connections that they make: ligaments connect one bone to another bone, tendons connect muscle to bone, and fasciae connect muscles to other muscles. 

Loch Ness Monster<====>17877<====>Loch Ness Monster    The Loch Ness Monster, or Nessie, is an aquatic being which reputedly inhabits Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands.  It is similar to other supposed lake monsters in Scotland and elsewhere, and is often described as being large in size, with a long neck and one or more humps protruding from the water.  Popular interest and belief in the creature has varied since it was brought to worldwide attention in 1933.  Evidence of its existence is anecdotal, with a few disputed photographs and sonar readings. The creature commonly appears in Western media where it manifests in a variety of ways. 

Laser science<====>17878<====>Laser science Laser science or laser physics is a branch of optics that describes the theory and practice of lasers.   Laser science is principally concerned with quantum electronics, laser construction, optical cavity design, the physics of producing a population inversion in laser media, and the temporal evolution of the light field in the laser.  It is also concerned with the physics of laser beam propagation, particularly the physics of Gaussian beams, with laser applications, and with associated fields such as nonlinear optics and quantum optics. History Laser science predates the invention of the laser itself.  Albert Einstein created the foundations for the laser and maser in 1917, via a paper in which he re-derived Max Planck’s law of radiation using a formalism based on probability coefficients (Einstein coefficients) for the absorption, spontaneous emission, and stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. 

Lincoln, England<====>17880<====>Lincoln, England  {{Infobox settlement }}Lincoln (   ) is a cathedral city and the county town of Lincolnshire in the East Midlands of England.  The non-metropolitan district of Lincoln had a 2012 population of 94,600.   The 2011 census gave the urban area of Lincoln, which includes North Hykeham and Waddington, a population of 130,200.   The Roman town of Lindum Colonia developed from an Iron Age settlement.  Lincoln's major landmarks are Lincoln Cathedral, a famous example of English Gothic architecture, and Lincoln Castle, an 11th-century Norman castle.  The city is also home to the University of Lincoln, Bishop Grosseteste University and Lincoln City Football Club. 

Luftwaffe<====>17885<====>LuftwaffeThe Luftwaffe  ( ) was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II.  Germany's military air arms during World War I, the Luftstreitkräfte of the Army and the Marine-Fliegerabteilung of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force. During the interwar period, German pilots were trained secretly in violation of the treaty at Lipetsk Air Base.  With the rise of the Nazi Party and the repudiation of the Versailles Treaty, the Luftwaffe was officially established on 26 February 1935. 

Lafora disease<====>17886<====>Lafora disease  Lafora disease, also called Lafora progressive myoclonic epilepsy or MELF,  is a fatal autosomal recessive    genetic disorder characterized by the presence of inclusion bodies, known as Lafora bodies, within the cytoplasm of the cells in the heart, liver, muscle, and skin. Lafora disease is also a neurodegenerative disease that causes impairment in the development of cerebral cortical neurons and it is a glycogen metabolism disorder.  Dogs can also have the condition.  Typically Lafora is rare in American children but has a high occurrence in children from Southern European descent (Italy, France, Spain) and can also be found in children from South Asian countries (Pakistan, India) and even as far south as North Africa. 

Lassa fever<====>17887<====>Lassa fever   Lassa fever, also known as Lassa hemorrhagic fever (LHF), is a type of viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus.   Many of those infected by the virus do not develop symptoms.   When symptoms occur they typically include fever, weakness, headaches, vomiting, and muscle pains.   Less commonly there may be bleeding from the mouth or gastrointestinal tract.   The risk of death once infected is about one percent and frequently occurs within two weeks of the onset of symptoms.   Among those who survive about a quarter have deafness which improves over time in about half. 

Leon Trotsky<====>17888<====>Leon Trotsky    Leon Trotsky ( ;   born Lev Davidovich Bronstein;    – 21 August 1940) was a Marxist revolutionary, theorist, and Soviet politician.  Initially supporting the Menshevik Internationalists faction within the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, he joined the Bolsheviks ("majority") just before the 1917 October Revolution, immediately becoming a leader within the Communist Party.  He would go on to become one of the seven members of the first Politburo, founded in 1917 to manage the Bolshevik Revolution.   During the early days of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and the Soviet Union, he served first as People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs and later as the founder and commander of the Red Army, with the title of People's Commissar of Military and Naval Affairs. 

Reference desk<====>17892<====>Reference desk  The reference desk or information desk of a library is a public service counter where professional librarians provide library users with direction to library materials, advice on library collections and services, and expertise on multiple kinds of information from multiple sources. Purpose and usageLibrary users can consult the staff at the reference desk for help in finding information.   Using a structured reference interview, the librarian works with the library user to clarify their needs and determine what information sources will fill them.    To borrow a medical analogy, reference librarians diagnose and treat information deficiencies. 

Leap year<====>17895<====>Leap year A leap year (also known as an intercalary year or bissextile year) is a calendar year containing one additional day (or, in the case of lunisolar calendars, a month) added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical or seasonal year.Because seasons and astronomical events do not repeat in a whole number of days, calendars that have the same number of days in each year drift over time with respect to the event that the year is supposed to track.  By inserting (also called intercalating) an additional day or month into the year, the drift can be corrected. 

Ludwig Mies van der Rohe<====>17897<====>Ludwig Mies van der Rohe   Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (   ;  ; born Maria Ludwig Michael Mies; March 27, 1886 – August 17, 1969) was a German-American architect.   He is commonly referred to and was addressed as Mies, his surname.  Along with Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius and Frank Lloyd Wright, he is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of modernist architecture. An innovative architect in 1920's and 1930's Germany, Mies was the last director of the Bauhaus, a seminal school in modern architecture.  After Nazism's rise to power, and with its strong opposition to modernism, which lead also the closing of the Bauhaus itself, Mies emigrated to the United States. 

Le Corbusier<====>17900<====>Le Corbusier   Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, known as Le Corbusier ( ; 6 October 1887 – 27 August 1965), was a Swiss-French architect, designer, painter, urban planner, writer, and one of the pioneers of what is now called modern architecture.  He was born in Switzerland and became a French citizen in 1930.  His career spanned five decades and he designed buildings in Europe, Japan, India, and North and South America. Dedicated to providing better living conditions for the residents of crowded cities, Le Corbusier was influential in urban planning, and was a founding member of the Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM). 

Ludovico Ariosto<====>17901<====>Ludovico Ariosto  Ludovico Ariosto ( ; 8 September 1474 – 6 July 1533) was an Italian poet.  He is best known as the author of the romance epic Orlando Furioso (1516).  The poem, a continuation of Matteo Maria Boiardo's Orlando Innamorato, describes the adventures of Charlemagne, Orlando, and the Franks as they battle against the Saracens with diversions into many sideplots.  Ariosto composed the poem in the ottava rima rhyme scheme and introduced narrative commentary throughout the work. Ariosto also coined the term "humanism" (in Italian, umanesimo)  for choosing to focus upon the strengths and potential of humanity, rather than only upon its role as subordinate to God. 

Leonhard Euler<====>17902<====>Leonhard Euler   Leonhard Euler (   ;   Swiss Standard German:   ;  German Standard German:   ; 15 April 1707 18 September 1783) was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, astronomer, logician and engineer who made important and influential discoveries in many branches of mathematics like infinitesimal calculus and graph theory while also making pioneering contributions to several branches such as topology and analytic number theory.  He also introduced much of the modern mathematical terminology and notation, particularly for mathematical analysis, such as the notion of a mathematical function.   He is also known for his work in mechanics, fluid dynamics, optics, astronomy, and music theory. 

Linear model<====>17904<====>Linear model In statistics, the term linear model is used in different ways according to the context.  The most common occurrence is in connection with regression models and the term is often taken as synonymous with linear regression model.   However, the term is also used in time series analysis with a different meaning.  In each case, the designation "linear" is used to identify a subclass of models for which substantial reduction in the complexity of the related statistical theory is possible. Linear regression models For the regression case, the statistical model is as follows.  Given a (random) sample   (Y_i, X_{i1}, \ldots, X_{ip}), \, i = 1, \ldots, n   the relation between the observations Y i  and the independent variables X ij  is formulated as Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \phi_1(X_{i1}) + \cdots + \beta_p \phi_p(X_{ip}) + \varepsilon_i \qquad i = 1, \ldots, n  where   \phi_1, \ldots, \phi_p   may be nonlinear functions. 

Likelihood principle<====>17905<====>Likelihood principleIn statistics,the likelihood principle is that, given a statistical model, all the evidence in a sample relevant to model parameters is contained in the likelihood function. A likelihood function arises from a probability density function considered as a function of its distributional parameterization argument.  For example, consider a model which gives the probability density function ƒ X (x | θ) of observable random variable X as a function of a parameter θ.  Then for a specific value x of X, the function  \mathcal L (θ | x) = ƒ X (x | θ) is a likelihood function of θ: it gives a measure of how "likely" any particular value of θ is, if we know that X has the value x. 

Led Zeppelin<====>17909<====>Led Zeppelin Led Zeppelin were   an English rock band formed in London in 1968.  The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham.  The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound has led them to be cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal.  Their style drew from a wide variety of influences, including blues, psychedelia, and folk music. After changing their name from the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that afforded them considerable artistic freedom. 

Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany<====>17911<====>Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany    Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany ( ; 24 July 1878 – 25 October 1957) was an Anglo-Irish writer and dramatist; his work, mostly in the fantasy genre, was published under the name Lord Dunsany.   More than ninety books of his work were published in his lifetime, Lanham, Maryland, USA, 1993: Rowman & Littlefield; Joshi, S. T.  and Schweitzer, Darrell; Lord Dunsany: A Comprehensive Bibliography (Studies in Supernatural Literature series); 304 pp.    and both original work and compilations have continued to appear.

Lars von Trier<====>17917<====>Lars von Trier    Lars von Trier (  Lars Trier, 30 April 1956)  is a Danish film director and screenwriter  with a prolific and controversialcareer spanning almost four decades.  His work is known for its genre and technical innovation;   confrontational examination of existential, social,   and politicalissues; and his treatment of subjects  such as mercy,  sacrifice, and mental health.   Among his more than 100 awards and 200 nominations    at film festivals worldwide, von Trier has received: the Palme d'Or (for Dancer in the Dark), the Grand Prix (for Breaking the Waves), the Prix du Jury (for Europa), and the Technical Grand Prize (for The Element of Crime and Europa) at the Cannes Film Festival. 

Monty Python's Life of Brian<====>17920<====>Monty Python's Life of Brian    Monty Python's Life of Brian, also known as Life of Brian, is a 1979 British religious satire comedy film starring and written by the comedy group Monty Python (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin).  It was also directed by Jones.  The film tells the story of Brian Cohen (played by Chapman), a young Jewish man who is born on the same day as, and next door to, Jesus Christ, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah. Following the withdrawal of funding by EMI Films just days before production was scheduled to begin, long-time Monty Python fan and former member of the Beatles, George Harrison, arranged financing for Life of Brian through the formation of his company HandMade Films. 

Lomography<====>17921<====>Lomography  Lomography is a commercial trademark of Lomographische AG, which their creators associate to a photographic image style and an analog camera movement and community facilitated by The Lomographic Society International.   The Lomographic Society International was founded in 1992 by a group of Viennese students after they discovered the LCA,  a camera created by LOMO PLC of Saint Petersburg, Russia.  Lomography started as an art movement through which the students put on exhibitions of photos within Vienna; the art movement then developed into a commercial enterprise.  Since 1995, Lomography has been the sole distributor of the LC-A camera outside  the former Soviet Union, and has moved into producing their own range of analog cameras, films and accessories. 

Loglan<====>17922<====>Loglan  Loglan is a constructed language originally designed for linguistic research, particularly for investigating the Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis.  The language was developed beginning in 1955 by Dr James Cooke Brown with the goal of making a language so different from natural languages that people learning it would think in a different way if the hypothesis were true.  In 1960 Scientific American published an article introducing the language.   Loglan is the first among, and the main inspiration for, the languages known as logical languages, which also includes Lojban. Brown founded The Loglan Institute (TLI) to develop the language and other applications of it. 

Leucippus<====>17924<====>Leucippus  Leucippus ( ;  , Leúkippos; fl.  5th cent.  BCE) is reported in some ancient  sources to have been a philosopher who was the earliest Greek to develop the theory of atomism—the idea that everything is composed entirely of various imperishable, indivisible elements called atoms.  Leucippus often appears as the master to his pupil Democritus, a philosopher also touted as the originator of the atomic theory.  However, a brief notice in Diogenes Laertius’s life of Epicurus says that on the testimony of Epicurus, Leucippus never existed.  As the philosophical heir of Democritus, Epicurus's word has some weight, and indeed a controversy over this matter raged in German scholarship for many years at the close of the 19th century. 

League of Nations<====>17926<====>League of NationsThe League of Nations (abbreviated as LN in English,abbreviated as   or   in French) was an intergovernmental organisation  founded on 10 January 1920 as a result of the Paris Peace Conference that ended the First World War.  It was the first international organisation whose principal mission was to maintain world peace.    Its primary goals, as stated in its Covenant, included preventing wars through collective security and disarmament and settling international disputes through negotiation and arbitration.   Other issues in this and related treaties included labour conditions, just treatment of native inhabitants, human and drug trafficking, the arms trade, global health, prisoners of war, and protection of minorities in Europe. 

Logic programming<====>17927<====>Logic programming  Logic programming is a type of programming paradigm which is largely based on formal logic.  Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain.   Major logic programming language families include Prolog, Answer set programming (ASP) and Datalog.  In all of these languages, rules are written in the form of clauses: H :- B 1 , …, B n .  and are read declaratively as logical implications: H if B 1  and … and B n . 

Lake Tana<====>17928<====>Lake Tana Lake Tana (also spelled T'ana,  ,  ,  ; an older variant is Tsana, Ge'ez: ጻና Ṣānā; sometimes called "Dembiya" after the region to the north of the lake) is the source of the Blue Nile and is the largest lake in Ethiopia.  Located in Amhara Region in the north-western Ethiopian Highlands, the lake is approximately 84 kilometers long and 66 kilometers wide, with a maximum depth of 15 meters,  and an elevation of 1,788 meters.   Lake Tana is fed by the Lesser Abay, Reb and Gumara rivers.  Its surface area ranges from 3,000 to 3,500 km², depending on season and rainfall. 

Lola Graham<====>17931<====>Lola Graham   Lola Glenn Graham was born in Melbourne on 23 September 1918.  She first came to public attention after winning a musical competition at age six by playing the piano.  In 1930 she was employed by Melbourne radio station 3?? and continued to work in radio for most of her life.  She also worked extensively in live musical theatre as a band member and accompanist.  Her repertoire included working with such artists as Barry Humphries.  She married Fred Menhennitt on 23 February 1957 and had two sons.  She died on 2 January 1992 after a long battle with cancer. 

Liquid-crystal display<====>17932<====>Liquid-crystal display   A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals.  Liquid crystals do not emit light directly, instead using a backlight or reflector to produce images in colour or monochrome.   LCDs are available to display arbitrary images (as in a general-purpose computer display) or fixed images with low information content, which can be displayed or hidden, such as preset words, digits, and 7-segment displays, as in a digital clock.  They use the same basic technology, except that arbitrary images are made up of a large number of small pixels, while other displays have larger elements. 

Latency (engineering)<====>17933<====>Latency (engineering) Latency is a time interval between the stimulation and response, or, from a more general point of view, a time delay between the cause and the effect of some physical change in the system being observed.   Latency is physically a consequence of the limited velocity with which any physical interaction can propagate.  The magnitude of this velocity is always less than or equal to the speed of light.  Therefore, every physical system will experience some sort of latency, regardless of the nature of stimulation that it has been exposed to. The precise definition of latency depends on the system being observed and the nature of stimulation. 

History of public transport authorities in London<====>17937<====>History of public transport authorities in London   The history of public transport authorities in London details the various organisations that have been responsible for the public transport network in and around London, England from 1933 until 2000 and have used the London Transport brand.  Their responsibilities have encompassed the buses, coaches, trams and the London Underground.  The period began with the creation of the London Passenger Transport Board, which covered the County of London and adjacent counties within a 30-mile (48-km) radius.  This area later came under the control of the London Transport Executive and then the London Transport Board. 

Light<====>17939<====>Light    Light is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.  The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight.   Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400–700 nanometres (nm), or 4. 00 × 10 −7  to 7. 00 × 10 −7  m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths).   This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430–750 terahertz (THz). 

Lipid<====>17940<====>Lipid  In biology, a lipid is a substance of biological origin that is soluble in nonpolar solvents.   It comprises a group of naturally occurring molecules that include fats, waxes, sterols, fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamins A, D, E, and K), monoglycerides, diglycerides, triglycerides, and phospholipids.  The main biological functions of lipids include storing energy, signaling, and acting as structural components of cell membranes.    Lipids have applications in the cosmetic and food industries as well as in nanotechnology.  Scientists sometimes broadly define lipids as hydrophobic or amphiphilic small molecules; the amphiphilic nature of some lipids allows them to form structures such as vesicles, multilamellar/unilamellar liposomes, or membranes in an aqueous environment. 

Lie algebra<====>17944<====>Lie algebra  In mathematics, a Lie algebra (pronounced   "Lee") is a vector space  \mathfrak g  together with a non-associative, alternating bilinear map  \mathfrak g \times \mathfrak g \rightarrow \mathfrak g; (x, y) \mapsto [x, y] , called the Lie bracket, satisfying the Jacobi identity. Lie algebras are closely related to Lie groups, which are groups that are also smooth manifolds, with the property that the group operations of multiplication and inversion are smooth maps.  Any Lie group gives rise to a Lie algebra.  Conversely, to any finite-dimensional Lie algebra over real or complex numbers, there is a corresponding connected Lie group unique up to covering (Lie's third theorem). 

Lie group<====>17945<====>Lie group   In mathematics, a Lie group (pronounced   "Lee") is a group that is also a differentiable manifold, with the property that the group operations are compatible with the smooth structure.  Lie groups are named after Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, who laid the foundations of the theory of continuous transformation groups. Lie groups represent the best-developed theory of continuous symmetry of mathematical objects and structures, which makes them indispensable tools for many parts of contemporary mathematics, as well as for modern theoretical physics.  They provide a natural framework for analysing the continuous symmetries of differential equations (differential Galois theory), in much the same way as permutation groups are used in Galois theory for analysing the discrete symmetries of algebraic equations. 

Lake Erie<====>17946<====>Lake Erie   Lake Erie  ( ;  ) is the fourth-largest lake (by surface area) of the five Great Lakes in North America, and the eleventh-largest globally if measured in terms of surface area.    It is the southernmost, shallowest, and smallest by volume of the Great Lakes   and therefore also has the shortest average water residence time.  At its deepest point Lake Erie is   deep. Situated on the International Boundary between Canada and the United States, Lake Erie's northern shore is the Canadian province of Ontario, with the U. 

Lake Ontario<====>17947<====>Lake Ontario   Lake Ontario ( ; Wyandot: Ontarí'io) is one of the five Great Lakes of North America.  It is surrounded on the north, west, and southwest by the Canadian province of Ontario, and on the south and east by the American state of New York, whose water boundaries meet in the middle of the lake.  Ontario, Canada's most populous province, was named for the lake.  In the Huron language, the name Ontarí'io means "Lake of Shining Waters".  Its primary inlet is the Niagara River from Lake Erie.   The last in the Great Lakes chain, Lake Ontario serves as the outlet to the Atlantic Ocean via the Saint Lawrence River. 

Lake Michigan<====>17948<====>Lake Michigan Lake Michigan is one of the five Great Lakes of North America and the only one located entirely within  the United States.  The other four Great Lakes are shared by the U. S.  and Canada.  It is the second-largest of the Great Lakes by volume  and the third-largest by surface area, after Lake Superior and Lake Huron (and is slightly smaller than the U. S.  state of West Virginia).  To the east, its basin is conjoined with that of Lake Huron through the wide Straits of Mackinac, giving it the same surface elevation as its easterly counterpart; the two are technically a single lake. 

Fibonacci<====>17949<====>Fibonacci  Fibonacci (c.  1175 – c.  1250)    was an Italian mathematician from the Republic of Pisa, considered to be "the  most talented Western mathematician of the Middle Ages".  The name he is commonly called, "Fibonacci" (  ), was made up in 1838 by the French historian Guillaume Libri  and is short for "filius Bonacci" ("son of (the) Bonacci")  and he is also known as Leonardo Bonacci, Leonardo of Pisa, Leonardo Pisano Bigollo, or Leonardo Fibonacci.  Fibonacci popularized the Hindu–Arabic numeral system in the Western World  primarily through his composition in 1202 of Liber Abaci (Book of Calculation). 

Lake Superior<====>17951<====>Lake Superior   Lake Superior ( ;  ) is the largest of the Great Lakes of North America.  The lake is shared by the Canadian province of Ontario to the north, the US state of Minnesota to the west, and Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to the south.  It is generally considered the largest freshwater lake in the world by surface area.  It is the world's third-largest freshwater lake by volume and the largest by volume in North America. The furthest north and west of the Great Lakes chain, Superior has the highest elevation of all five great lakes and drains into the St. 

Leipzig<====>17955<====>Leipzig   Leipzig ( ;  ) is the most populous city in the federal state of Saxony, Germany.  With a population of 582,277 inhabitants  (1. 1 million  residents in the larger urban zone)  it is Germany's tenth most populous city.    Leipzig is located about   southwest of Berlin at the confluence of the White Elster, Pleisse, and Parthe rivers at the southern end of the North German Plain. Leipzig has been a trade city since at least the time of the Holy Roman Empire.The city sits at the intersection of the Via Regia and Via Imperii, two important medieval trade routes. 

LimeWire<====>17956<====>LimeWire  LimeWire is a discontinued free peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) client for Windows, macOS, Linux and Solaris.   LimeWire used the gnutella network as well as the BitTorrent protocol.   A freeware version and a purchasable "enhanced" version were available.  BitTorrent support is provided by libtorrent. On October 26, 2010, U. S.  federal court judge Kimba Wood issued an injunction enforcing LimeWire to prevent "the searching, downloading, uploading, file trading and/or file distribution functionality, and/or all functionality" of its software in Arista Records LLC v.  Lime Group LLC.    A trial investigating the damages necessary to compensate the affected record labels was scheduled to begin in January 2011. 

Latveria<====>17957<====>Latveria  Latveria is a fictional nation appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.  It is depicted within the storylines of Marvel's comic titles as an isolated European country ruled by the fictional Supreme Lord Doctor Doom, supposedly located in the Banat region.  It is surrounded by the Carpathian Mountains, and also borders Symkaria (home of Silver Sable) to the south.  Its capital is Doomstadt as in Darmstadt. Publication historyLatveria first appeared in Fantastic Four Annual #2, published in 1964.  Victor von Doom is the ruler of Latveria.  Though he has been dethroned a number of times, Victor has inevitably managed to return to the throne of his country within a matter of months. 

Least common multiple<====>17961<====>Least common multipleIn arithmetic and number theory, the least common multiple, lowest common multiple, or smallest common multiple of two integers a and b, usually denoted by LCM(a, b), is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b.    Since division of integers by zero is undefined, this definition has meaning only if a and b are both different from zero. However, some authors define lcm(a,0) as 0 for all a, which is the result of taking the lcm to be the least upper bound in the lattice of divisibility. 

Louis St. Laurent<====>17962<====>Louis St.  Laurent   Louis Stephen St.  Laurent   (Saint-Laurent or St-Laurent in French, baptized Louis-Étienne St-Laurent; 1 February 1882 – 25 July 1973) was the 12th Prime Minister of Canada, from 15 November 1948 to 21 June 1957.  He was a Liberal with a strong base in the Catholic francophone community, from which base he had long mobilised support to Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King.  His foreign policy initiatives transformed Canada from an isolationist ex-colony with little role in world affairs to an active "middle power".   St.  Laurent was an enthusiastic proponent of Canada's joining NATO in 1949 to fight Communist totalitarianism, overcoming opposition from some intellectuals, the Labor-Progressive Party, and many French Canadians. 

List of literary cycles<====>17964<====>List of literary cyclesLiterary cycles are groups of stories grouped around common figures, often (though not necessarily) based on mythical figures or loosely on historic ones. Examples from folk and classical literatureThe Anansi tales, which center on the Ashanti  of Ghana trickster spider-spirit Anansi, and its variations in the Americas as Ti Malice and Bouki in Haiti, Br'er Rabbit or John and Old Master in the Southern US. The tales of the Arabian nights, brought together by the frame story of the tale of Scheherazade and Shahryār. The four troubadours Bernart d'Auriac, Pere Salvatge, Roger Bernard III of Foix, and Peter III of Aragon composed a cycle of four sirventes in the summer of 1285 concerning the Aragonese Crusade. 

Louis Leakey<====>17965<====>Louis Leakey   Louis Seymour Bazett Leakey (7 August 1903 – 1 October 1972), also known as L.  S.  B.  Leakey, was a Kenyan paleoanthropologist and archaeologist whose work was important in demonstrating that humans evolved in Africa, particularly through discoveries made at Olduvai Gorge with his wife, fellow paleontologist Mary Leakey.  Having established a program of palaeoanthropological inquiry in eastern Africa, he also motivated many future generations to continue this scholarly work.  Several members of Leakey's family became prominent scholars themselves. Another of Leakey's legacies stems from his role in fostering field research of primates in their natural habitats, which he saw as key to understanding human evolution. 

Liar paradox<====>17967<====>Liar paradoxIn philosophy and logic, the classical liar paradox or liar's paradox is the statement of a liar who states that they are lying: for instance, declaring that "I am lying" or "everything I say is false".  If they are indeed lying, they are telling the truth, which means they are lying.  In "this sentence is a lie" the paradox is strengthened in order to make it amenable to more rigorous logical analysis.  It is still generally called the "liar paradox" although abstraction is made precisely from the liar himself.  Trying to assign to this statement, the strengthened liar, a classical binary truth value leads to a contradiction. 

Louchébem<====>17968<====>Louchébem Louchébem or loucherbem ( ) is Parisian and Lyonnaise butchers' (French boucher) slang, similar to Pig Latin and Verlan.  It originated in the mid-19th century and was in common use until the 1950s. ProcessThe louchébem word-creation process resembles that of largonji, verlan, and javanais, in that existing words are camouflaged according to a set of rules.   Strictly speaking, louchébem is a more rigid variety of largonji in which the ending -èm is obligatory.   Largonji substitutes   for the consonant or consonant cluster at the beginning of the word, or, if the word begins with an   or a vowel, the second syllable; the initial consonant is then reattached to the end of the word along with a suffix particular to the argot: -ji  , -oc  , -ic  , -uche  , -ès  , or in the case of louchébem, -em/ème  . 

Leon M. Lederman<====>17970<====>Leon M.  Lederman Leon Max Lederman (born July 15, 1922) is an American experimental physicist who received the Wolf Prize in Physics in 1982, along with Martin Lewis Perl, for their research on quarks and leptons, and the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1988, along with Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger, for their research on neutrinos.  He is Director Emeritus of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in Batavia, Illinois, USA.   He founded the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, in Aurora, Illinois in 1986, and has been Resident Scholar Emeritus since 2012. In 2012, he was awarded the Vannevar Bush Award for his extraordinary contributions to understanding the basic forces and particles of nature. 

Louis the Pious<====>17972<====>Louis the PiousLouis the Pious (778 – 20 June 840), also called the Fair, and the Debonaire,  was the King of the Franks and co-Emperor (as Louis I) with his father, Charlemagne, from 813.  He was also King of Aquitaine from 781. As the only surviving adult son of Charlemagne and Hildegard, he became the sole ruler of the Franks after his father's death in 814, a position which he held until his death, save for the period 833–34, during which he was deposed. During his reign in Aquitaine, Louis was charged with the defence of the empire's southwestern frontier. 

Liquid crystal<====>17973<====>Liquid crystal Liquid crystals (LCs) are matter in a state which has properties between those of conventional liquids and those of solid crystals.   For instance, a liquid crystal may flow like a liquid, but its molecules may be oriented in a crystal-like way.  There are many different types of liquid-crystal phases, which can be distinguished by their different optical properties (such as birefringence).  When viewed under a microscope using a polarized light source, different liquid crystal phases will appear to have distinct textures.  The contrasting areas in the textures correspond to domains where the liquid-crystal molecules are oriented in different directions. 

Long gun<====>17974<====>Long gunA long gun is a category of firearms with longer barrels than other classes.   In small arms, a long gun is generally designed to be held by both hands and braced against the shoulder, in contrast to a handgun, which can be fired being held with a single hand.   In the context of cannons and mounted firearms an artillery long gun would be contrasted with a howitzer or carronade.   Small armsThe actual length of the barrels of a long gun are subject to various laws in many jurisdictions, for example by the National Firearms Act in the United States, which sets a minimum length of 16 inches (40 cm) for rifle barrels and 18 inches (45 cm) for shotgun barrels. 

Law of definite proportions<====>17981<====>Law of definite proportionsIn chemistry, the law of definite proportion, sometimes called Proust's law or the law of definite composition, or law of constant composition states that a given chemical compound always contains its component elements in fixed ratio (by mass) and does not depend on its source and method of preparation.   For example, oxygen makes up about  8 / 9  of the mass of any sample of pure water, while hydrogen makes up the remaining  1 / 9  of the mass.   Along with the law of multiple proportions, the law of definite proportions forms the basis of stoichiometry. 

Limbo<====>17982<====>Limbo In Catholic theology, Limbo (Latin  , edge or boundary, referring to the "edge" of Hell) is a speculative idea about the afterlife condition of those who die in original sin without being assigned to the Hell of the Damned.  Medieval theologians of western Europe described the underworld ("hell", "hades", "infernum") as divided into four distinct parts: Hell of the Damned, Catholic Encyclopedia: Hell: "However, in the New Testament the term Gehenna is used more frequently in preference to hades, as a name for the place of punishment of the damned.  . . .  held in abomination by the Jews, who, accordingly, used the name of this valley to designate the abode of the damned (Targ. 

Lethe<====>17983<====>Lethe   In Greek mythology, Lethe   (Greek:  , Lḗthē;  ,  ) was one of the five rivers of the underworld of Hades.   Also known as the Ameles potamos (river of unmindfulness), the Lethe flowed around the cave of Hypnos and through the Underworld, where all those who drank from it experienced complete forgetfulness.   Lethe was also the name of the Greek spirit of forgetfulness and oblivion, with whom the river was often identified. In Classical Greek, the word   literally means "oblivion", "forgetfulness", or "concealment".    It is related to the Greek word for "truth", aletheia ( ), which through the privative alpha literally means "un-forgetfulness" or "un-concealment". 

Laurence Sterne<====>17988<====>Laurence Sterne   Laurence Sterne (24 November 1713 – 18 March 1768) was an Irish novelist and an Anglican clergyman.  He wrote the novels The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman and A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy, and also published many sermons, wrote memoirs, and was involved in local politics.   Sterne died in London after years of fighting consumption. Early life and educationSterne was born in Clonmel, County Tipperary.  His father, Roger Sterne, was an ensign in a British regiment recently returned from Dunkirk, which was disbanded on the day of Sterne's birth. 

Linear A<====>17989<====>Linear A    Linear A is one of two currently undeciphered writing systems used in ancient Greece (Cretan hieroglyphic is the other).  Linear A was the primary script used in palace and religious writings of the Minoan civilization.  It was discovered by archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans.  It is the origin of the Linear B script, which was later used by the Mycenaean civilization. In the 1950s, Linear B was largely deciphered and found to encode an early form of Greek.  Although the two systems share many symbols, this did not lead to a subsequent decipherment of Linear A. 

LucasArts<====>17990<====>LucasArts    LucasArts Entertainment Company, LLC  is an American video game publisher    and licensor.   Until 2013, it was also a video game developer.  LucasArts is best known for its graphic adventure games, as well as games based on the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises.  Its headquarters are located in San Francisco, California. It was founded in May 1982 by George Lucas as Lucasfilm Games, the video game development group of his film company, Lucasfilm.  Lucas initially served as the company's chairman.  During a 1990 reorganization of Lucas companies, the Lucasfilm Games division was renamed LucasArts. 

Lafcadio Hearn<====>17992<====>Lafcadio Hearn  Patrick Lafcadio Hearn ( ; 27 June 1850 – 26 September 1904) in Greek  , known also by the Japanese name  , was an international writer, known best for his books about Japan, especially his collections of Japanese legends and ghost stories, such as Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things.  In the United States, Hearn is also known for his writings about the city of New Orleans based on his ten-year stay in that city. LifeEarly lifeHearn was born in and named after the island of Lefkada, one of the Greek Ionian Islands, on 27 June 1850. 

Learning theory (education)<====>17994<====>Learning theory (education)Learning theories are conceptual frameworks describing how knowledge is absorbed, processed, and retained during learning.  Simandan, D. , 2013.  Introduction: Learning as a geographical process.  The Professional Geographer, 65(3), pp. 363-368.  https://dx. doi. org/10. 1080/00330124. 2012. 693872  Cognitive, emotional, and environmental influences, as well as prior experience, all play a part in how understanding, or a world view, is acquired or changed and knowledge and skills retained.   Behaviorists look at learning as an aspect of conditioning and will advocate a system of rewards and targets in education.  Educators who embrace cognitive theory believe that the definition of learning as a change in behavior is too narrow and prefer to study the learner rather than their environment and in particular the complexities of human memory. 

Long-term memory<====>17995<====>Long-term memory Long-term memory (LTM) is the stage of the Atkinson–Shiffrin memory model where informative knowledge is held indefinitely.  It is defined in contrast to short-term and working memory, that persist for only about 18 to 30 seconds.  Long-term memory is commonly labelled as explicit memory (declarative), as well as episodic memory, semantic memory, autobiographical memory, and implicit memory (procedural memory). Dual-store memory modelAccording to Miller, whose paper in 1956 popularized the theory of the "magic number seven", short-term memory is limited to a certain number of chunks of information, while long-term memory has a limitless store.  Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model According to the dual store memory model proposed by Richard C. 

List of Latin phrases<====>17996<====>List of Latin phrasesThis page lists direct English translations of common Latin phrases, such as veni, vidi, vici and et cetera.  Some of the phrases are themselves translations of Greek phrases, as Greek rhetoric and literature were highly regarded in Ancient Rome when Latin rhetoric and literature were still maturing. The Latin letter i may be used either as a vowel or a consonant.  When used as a consonant, it often is replaced by the letter j, which originally, was simply an orthographic "long i" that was used in initial positions and when it occurred between two other vowels. 

Latin declension<====>17997<====>Latin declension Latin declension is the patterns according to which Latin words are declined, or have their endings altered to show grammatical case and gender.  Nouns, pronouns, and adjectives are declined (verbs are conjugated), and a given pattern is called a declension.  There are five declensions, which are numbered and grouped by ending and grammatical gender.  For simple declension paradigms, visit the Wiktionary appendices:,  ,  ,  ,  .  Each noun follows one of the five declensions, but some irregular nouns have exceptions. Adjectives are of two kinds: those like   'good' belong to the first and second declensions, using first-declension endings for the feminine, and second-declension for masculine and neuter. 

List of Latin words with English derivatives<====>17998<====>List of Latin words with English derivatives  This is a list of Latin words with derivatives in English (and other modern languages). Ancient orthography did not distinguish between i and j or between u and v.   Many modern works distinguish u from v but not i from j.  In this article, both distinctions are shown as they are helpful when tracing the origin of English words.  See also Latin spelling and pronunciation. Nouns and adjectivesThe citation form for nouns (the form normally shown in Latin dictionaries) is the Latin nominative singular, but that typically does not exhibit the root form from which English nouns are generally derived. 

Latin spelling and pronunciation<====>17999<====>Latin spelling and pronunciation  Latin spelling, or Latin orthography, is the spelling of Latin words written in the scripts of all historical phases of Latin from Old Latin to the present.  All scripts use the same alphabet, but conventional spellings may vary from phase to phase.  The Roman alphabet, or Latin alphabet, was adapted from the Old Italic script to represent the phonemes of the Latin language.  The Old Italic script had in turn been borrowed from the Greek alphabet, itself adapted from the Phoenician alphabet. The Latin alphabet most resembles the Greek alphabet around 540 BC, as it appears on the red-figures pottery of the time. 

Latin conjugation<====>18000<====>Latin conjugation Latin verbs have four main patterns of conjugation.  As in a number of other languages, most Latin verbs have an active voice and a passive voice.  There also exist deponent and semi-deponent Latin verbs (verbs with a passive form but active meaning), as well as defective verbs (verbs with a perfect form but present meaning).  Sometimes the verbs of the third conjugation with a present stem on -ǐ (short i) are regarded as a separate pattern of conjugation, and are called the fifth conjugation, or third-io conjugation. Conjugation is the creation of derived forms of a verb from basic forms, or principal parts. 

Louisa May Alcott<====>18002<====>Louisa May Alcott  Louisa May Alcott ( ; November 29, 1832 March 6, 1888) was an American novelist and poet best known as the author of the novel Little Women (1868) and its sequels Little Men (1871) and Jo's Boys (1886).   Raised by her transcendentalist parents, Abigail May and Amos Bronson Alcott in New England, she also grew up among many of the well-known intellectuals of the day such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau. Alcott's family suffered financial difficulties, and while she worked to help support the family from an early age, she also sought an outlet in writing. 

LALR parser<====>18004<====>LALR parser In computer science, an LALR parser  or Look-Ahead LR parser is a simplified version of a canonical LR parser, to parse (separate and analyze) a text according to a set of production rules specified by a formal grammar for a computer language.  ("LR" means left-to-right, rightmost derivation. )The LALR parser was invented by Frank DeRemer in his 1969 PhD dissertation, Practical Translators for LR(k) languages,  in his treatment of the practical difficulties at that time of implementing LR(1) parsers.  He showed that the LALR parser has more language recognition power than the LR(0) parser, while requiring the same number of states as the LR(0) parser for a language that can be recognized by both parsers. 

Language center<====>18008<====>Language centerThe term language center or language centre (or more accurately centers, e. g.  Broca's area and Wernicke's area) refers to the areas of the brain which serve a particular function for speech processing and production.    Current scientific consensusNew medical imaging techniques such as PET and fMRI have allowed researchers to generate pictures showing which areas of a living brain are active at a given time.  In the past, research was primarily based on observations of loss of ability resulting from damage to the cerebral cortex.  Indeed, medical imaging has represented a radical step forward for research on speech processing. 

Lift (force)<====>18009<====>Lift (force) A fluid flowing past the surface of a body exerts a force on it.  Lift is the component of this force that is perpendicular to the oncoming flow direction.   It contrasts with the drag force, which is the component of the force parallel to the flow direction.   Lift conventionally acts in an upward direction in order to counter the force of gravity, but it can act in any direction at right angles to the flow. If the surrounding fluid is air, the force is called an aerodynamic force.  In water or any other liquid, it is called a hydrodynamic force.

Loki<====>18013<====>Loki  Loki (Old Norse [ˈloki], Modern Icelandic [ˈlɔːkɪ], often Anglicized as  ) is a god in Norse mythology.  Loki is in some sources the son of Fárbauti and Laufey, and the brother of Helblindi and Býleistr.  By the jötunn Angrboða, Loki is the father of Hel, the wolf Fenrir, and the world serpent Jörmungandr.  By his wife Sigyn, Loki is the father of Narfi and/or Nari.  By the stallion Svaðilfari, Loki is the mother—giving birth in the form of a mare—to the eight-legged horse Sleipnir.  In addition, Loki is referred to as the father of Váli in Prose Edda, though this source also refers to Odin as the father of Váli twice, and Váli is found mentioned as a Son of Loki only once. 

Lisp (programming language)<====>18016<====>Lisp (programming language)  Lisp (historically, LISP) is a family of computer programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation.    Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today.  Only Fortran is older, by one year.    Lisp has changed since its early days, and many dialects have existed over its history.  Today, the best known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp and Scheme. Lisp was originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs, influenced by the notation of Alonzo Church's lambda calculus. 

List of logarithmic identities<====>18019<====>List of logarithmic identitiesIn mathematics, there are many logarithmic identities. Trivial identities \log_b(1) = 0    because    b^0 = 1 , given that b>0  \log_b(b) = 1    because    b^1 = b  Note that   is undefined because there is no number   such that  .  In fact, there is a vertical asymptote on the graph of   at  . Cancelling exponentialsLogarithms and exponentials with the same base cancel each other.  This is true because logarithms and exponentials are inverse operations (just like multiplication and division or addition and subtraction). 

Lost city<====>18020<====>Lost city  A lost city is a settlement that fell into terminal decline and became extensively or completely uninhabited, with the consequence that the site's former significance was no longer known to the wider world.  The locations of many lost cities have been forgotten, but some have been rediscovered and studied extensively by scientists.  Recently abandoned cities or cities whose location was never in question might be referred to as ruins or ghost towns.  The search for such lost cities by European explorers and adventurers in Africa, the Americas, and Southeast Asia from the 15th century onwards eventually led to the development of archaeology. 

Louis Agassiz<====>18023<====>Louis Agassiz  Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz ( ;  ; May 28, 1807 December 14, 1873) was a Swiss-American biologist and geologist recognized as an innovative and prodigious scholar of Earth's natural history, with later American writings that have received criticism for their endorsement of scientific racism.  Agassiz grew up in Switzerland, and studied and received Doctor of Philosophy and medical degrees at Erlangen and Munich, respectively.  After further studies with Cuvier and Humboldt in Paris, Agassiz proceeded with research leading to his appointment as professor of natural history at University of Neuchâtel. After visiting Harvard University mid-career, he emigrated to the United States in 1847 and became a professor of zoology and geology at Harvard, and to head its Lawrence Scientific School and found its Museum of Comparative Zoology. 

Li Bai<====>18024<====>Li Bai    Li Bai (701–762), also known as Li Bo or Li Taibai, was a Chinese poet acclaimed from his own day to the present as a genius and a romantic figure who took traditional poetic forms to new heights.  He and his friend Du Fu (712–770) were the two most prominent figures in the flourishing of Chinese poetry in the Tang dynasty, which is often called the "Golden Age of Chinese Poetry".  The expression "Three Wonders" referred to Li Bai's poetry, Pei Min's swordplay, and Zhang Xu's calligraphy.  Around a thousand poems attributed to him are extant. 

Longship<====>18025<====>Longship Longships were a type of ship invented and used by the Norsemen (commonly known as the Vikings) for trade, commerce, exploration, and warfare during the Viking Age.  The longship's design evolved over many centuries, beginning in the Stone Age with the invention of the umiak and continuing up until the 6th century with clinker-built ships like Nydam and Kvalsund.  The longship appeared in its complete form between the 9th and 13th centuries.  The character and appearance of these ships have been reflected in Scandinavian boat-building traditions until today.  The particular skills and methods employed in making longships are still used worldwide, often with modern adaptations. 

Luigi Alamanni<====>18026<====>Luigi AlamanniLuigi Alamanni (sometimes spelt Alemanni) (6 March 1495 18 April 1556) was an Italian poet and statesman.    He was regarded as a prolific and versatile poet.   He was credited with introducing the epigram into Italian poetry. BiographyAlamanni was born in Florence.  His father was a devoted adherent of the Medici party, but Luigi, smarting under a supposed injustice, joined with others in an unsuccessful conspiracy against Giulio de' Medici, afterwards Pope Clement VII.  He was obliged in consequence to take refuge in Venice, and, on the accession of Clement, to flee to France. 

Louis Aleman<====>18028<====>Louis Aleman Blessed Louis Aleman (  16 September 1450) was a French Roman Catholic cardinal and a professed member of the now-suppressed Canons Regular of Saint John Baptist.He served as the Archbishop of Arles from 1423 until his resignation in 1440 when he had resigned from the cardinalate.  But he was later reinstated as a cardinal on 19 December 1449 at which point he served as the Protopriest and also reclaimed his titular church.  Aleman served as the Bishop of Maguelonne from 1418 until his archepiscopal elevation at which point he was later named a cardinal. 

LR parser<====>18030<====>LR parserIn computer science, LR parsers are a type of bottom-up parser that efficiently handle deterministic context-free languages in guaranteed linear time.The LALR parsers and the SLR parsers are common variants of LR parsers.   LR parsers are often mechanically generated from a formal grammar for the language by a parser generator tool.  They are widely used for the processing of computer languages. The name LR is an initialism.  The L means that the parser reads input text in one direction without backing up; that direction is typically Left to right within each line, and top to bottom across the lines of the full input file. 

Leon Battista Alberti<====>18031<====>Leon Battista Alberti Leon Battista Alberti ( ; February 18, 1404 – April 25, 1472) was an Italian humanist author, artist, architect, poet, priest, linguist, philosopher and cryptographer; he epitomised the Renaissance Man.  Although he is often characterized exclusively as an architect, as James Beck has observed,  "to single out one of Leon Battista's 'fields' over others as somehow functionally independent and self-sufficient is of no help at all to any effort to characterize Alberti's extensive explorations in the fine arts. "  Although Alberti is known mostly for being an artist, he was also a mathematician of many sorts and made great advances to this field during the 15th century. 

Little Nemo<====>18033<====>Little Nemo    Little Nemo   is a fictional character created by American cartoonist Winsor McCay. Nemo was originally the protagonist of the comic strip  Little Nemo in Slumberland.   The full-page weekly strip depicted Nemo having fantastic dreams that were interrupted by his awakening in the final panel.   The strip is considered McCay's masterpiece for its experiments with the form of the comics page, its use of color, its timing and pacing, the size and shape of its panels, perspective, architectural and other detail. Little Nemo in Slumberland ran in the New York Herald from October 15, 1905, until July 23, 1911; the strip was renamed In the Land of Wonderful Dreams when McCay brought it to William Randolph Hearst's New York American, where it ran from September 3, 1911 until July 26, 1914. 

Lydia<====>18039<====>Lydia  Lydia (Assyrian: Luddu;  ,  ) was an Iron Age kingdom of western Asia Minor located generally east of ancient Ionia in the modern western Turkish provinces of Uşak, Manisa and inland İzmir.  Its population spoke an Anatolian language known as Lydian.  Its capital was Sardis.  Rhodes, P. J.  A History of the Classical Greek World 478-323 BC.  2nd edition.  Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010, p.  6.   The Kingdom of Lydia existed from about 1200 BC to 546 BC.  At its greatest extent during the 7th century BC, it covered all of western Anatolia.

GeographyThe actual Land’s End or Peal Point, is a modest headland compared with nearby headlands such as Pedn-men-dhu overlooking Sennen Cove and Pordenack, to the south.  The present hotel and tourist complex is at Carn Kez, 200 m south of the actual Land’s End. 

Liber Memorialis<====>18041<====>Liber Memorialis The Liber Memorialis is an ancient book in Latin featuring an extremely concise summary—a kind of index—of universal history from earliest times to the reign of Trajan.  It was written by Lucius Ampelius, who was possibly a tutor or schoolmaster.  DescriptionThe book is dedicated to a Macrinus, who may have been the emperor who reigned 217–218, but that name was not uncommon, and it seems more likely he was simply a young man with a thirst for universal knowledge, which the book was compiled to satisfy. The book's object and scope are indicated in its dedication: The Liber Memorialis seems to have been intended as a textbook to be learned by heart. 

Lancelot Andrewes<====>18043<====>Lancelot Andrewes   Lancelot Andrewes (1555 – 25 September 1626) was an English bishop and scholar, who held high positions in the Church of England during the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I.  During the latter's reign, Andrewes served successively as Bishop of Chichester, of Ely, and of Winchester and oversaw the translation of the King James Version of the Bible (or Authorized Version).  In the Church of England he is commemorated on 25 September with a Lesser Festival.

Lucius Tarquinius Priscus<====>18046<====>Lucius Tarquinius Priscus Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, or Tarquin the Elder, was the legendary fifth king of Rome from 616 to 579 BC.  His wife was Tanaquil. Early lifeAccording to Livy, Tarquin came from Etruria.  Livy claims that his original Etruscan name was Lucumo, but since Lucumo (Etruscan Lauchume) is the Etruscan word for "King", there is reason to believe that Priscus' name and title have been confused in the official tradition.  After inheriting his father's entire fortune, Lucius attempted to gain a political office.  Disgruntled with his opportunities in Etruria (he had been prohibited from obtaining political office in Tarquinii because of the ethnicity of his father, Demaratus, who came from the Greek city of Corinth), he migrated to Rome with his wife Tanaquil, at her suggestion. 

Lucius Tarquinius Superbus<====>18047<====>Lucius Tarquinius Superbus Lucius Tarquinius Superbus (died 495 BC) was the legendary seventh and final king of Rome, reigning from 535 BC until the popular uprising in 509 that led to the establishment of the Roman Republic.  He is commonly known as Tarquin the Proud, from his cognomen Superbus (Latin for "proud, arrogant, lofty").  Ancient accounts of the Regal period mingle history and legend.   Tarquin was said to have been the son or grandson of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, the fifth king of Rome, and to have gained the throne through the murders of both his wife and his elder brother, followed by the assassination of his predecessor, Servius Tullius. 

Libertarian socialism<====>18048<====>Libertarian socialism   Libertarian socialism (or socialist libertarianism)  is a group of anti-authoritarian  political philosophies inside the socialist movement that rejects socialism as centralized state ownership and control of the economy.  Libertarian socialism also rejects the state itself, "So, libertarian socialism rejects the idea of state ownership and control of the economy, along with the state as such.  Through workers' self-management it proposes to bring an end to authority, exploitation, and hierarchy in production. " "I1.  Isn´t libertarian socialism an oxymoron" in An Anarchist FAQ  is close to and overlaps with left-libertarianism   and criticizes wage labour relationships within the workplace,  instead emphasizing workers' self-management of the workplace  and decentralized structures of political organization. 

Livy<====>18049<====>Livy  Titus Livius ( ; 64 or 59 BC AD 12 or 17) – often rendered as Livy   in English language sources – was a Roman historian.  He wrote a monumental history of Rome and the Roman people – Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Books from the Foundation of the City) – covering the period from the earliest legends of Rome before the traditional foundation in 753 BC through the reign of Augustus in Livy's own lifetime.  He was on familiar terms with members of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, advising Augustus's grandnephew, the future emperor Claudius, as a young man not long before 14 AD in a letter to take up the writing of history. 

Labour Day<====>18051<====>Labour Day   Labour Day (Labor Day in the United States) is an annual holiday to celebrate the achievements of workers.  Labour Day has its origins in the labour union movement, specifically the eight-hour day movement, which advocated eight hours for work, eight hours for recreation, and eight hours for rest.  Google honors Labour Day with a doodle on 1st may . For most countries, Labour Day is synonymous with, or linked with, International Workers' Day, which occurs on 1 May.  For other countries, Labour Day is celebrated on a different date, often one with special significance for the labour movement in that country. 

Bodyline<====>18053<====>Bodyline  Bodyline, also known as fast leg theory bowling, was a cricketing tactic devised by the English cricket team for their 1932–33 Ashes tour of Australia, specifically to combat the extraordinary batting skill of Australia's Don Bradman.  England's use of a tactic perceived by some as overly aggressive or even unfair ultimately threatened diplomatic relations between the two countries before the situation was calmed. A bodyline delivery was one where the cricket ball was bowled at the body of the batsman, in the hope that when he defended himself with his bat, a resulting deflection could be caught by one of several fielders standing close by. 

Laws of infernal dynamics<====>18056<====>Laws of infernal dynamics  The laws of infernal dynamics are an adage about the cursedness of the universe.  Attributed to Science fiction author David Gerrold, the laws are as follows:An object in motion will be moving in the wrong direction. An object at rest will be in the wrong place. The energy required to move an object in the correct direction, or put it in the right place, will be more than you wish to expend but not so much as to make the task impossible. The laws are a parody on the first and second of Newton's laws of motion in the spirit of Murphy's law.

Latin literature<====>18058<====>Latin literature  Latin literature includes the essays, histories, poems, plays, and other writings written in the Latin language.   Beginning around the 3rd century BC, it took two centuries to become a dominant literature of ancient Rome,  with many educated Romans still reading and writing in Ancient Greek, as late as Marcus Aurelius (121–180 AD).   Latin literature was in many ways a continuation of ancient Greek literature, using many of the same forms. Latin was the language of the ancient Romans, but it was also the lingua franca of Western Europe throughout the Middle Ages, so Latin literature includes not only Roman authors like Cicero, Vergil, Ovid and Horace, but also includes European writers after the fall of the Empire, from religious writers like Aquinas (1225–1274), to secular writers like Francis Bacon (1561–1626), Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677), and Isaac Newton (1642–1727). 

Leonard Bloomfield<====>18060<====>Leonard BloomfieldNot to be confused with the English naturalist Leonard Blomefield (1800–1893) Leonard Bloomfield (April 1, 1887 – April 18, 1949) was an American linguist who led the development of structural linguistics in the United States during the 1930s and the 1940s.  His influential textbook Language, published in 1933, presented a comprehensive description of American structural linguistics.   He made significant contributions to Indo-European historical linguistics, the description of Austronesian languages, and description of languages of the Algonquian family. Bloomfield's approach to linguistics was characterized by its emphasis on the scientific basis of linguistics, adherence to behaviorism especially in his later work, and emphasis on formal procedures for the analysis of linguistic data. 

Leather<====>18062<====>Leather  Leather is a durable and flexible material created by tanning animal rawhide and skin, mostly cattle hide.  It can be produced at manufacturing scales ranging from cottage industry to heavy industry. People use leather to make various goods—including clothing (e. g. , shoes, hats, jackets, skirts, trousers, and belts), bookbinding, leather wallpaper, and as a furniture covering.  It is produced in a wide variety of types and styles, decorated by a wide range of techniques. FormsSeveral tanning processes transform hides and skins into leather:Chrome-tanned leather, invented in 1858, is tanned using chromium sulfate and other chromium salts. 

Long Parliament<====>18065<====>Long Parliament   The Long Parliament was an English Parliament which lasted from 1640 until 1660.  It followed the fiasco of the Short Parliament which had been held for three weeks during the spring of 1640, and which in its turn had followed an 11-year parliamentary absence.  In September 1640  writs were issued summoning a parliament to convene on 3 November 1640 This article uses the Julian calendar with the start of year adjusted to 1 January – for a more detailed explanation, see Old Style and New Style dates.   by King Charles I. 

Lubricant<====>18069<====>Lubricant A lubricant is a substance, usually organic, introduced to reduce friction between surfaces in mutual contact, which ultimately reduces the heat generated when the surfaces move.  It may also have the function of transmitting forces, transporting foreign particles, or heating or cooling the surfaces.  The property of reducing friction is known as lubricity. In addition to industrial applications, lubricants are used for many other purposes.  Other uses include cooking (oils and fats in use in frying pans, in baking to prevent food sticking), bioapplications on humans (e. g.  lubricants for artificial joints), ultrasound examination, medical examinations, and the use of personal lubricant for sexual purposes. 

Lise Meitner<====>18070<====>Lise Meitner  Lise Meitner ( ; 7 November 1878 – 27 October 1968) was an Austrian-Swedish physicist who worked on radioactivity and nuclear physics.  Meitner and Otto Hahn led the small group of scientists who first discovered nuclear fission of uranium when it absorbed an extra neutron; the results were published in early 1939.    Meitner and Otto Frisch understood that the fission process, which splits the atomic nucleus of uranium into two smaller nuclei, must be accompanied by an enormous release of energy.  Nuclear fission is the process exploited by nuclear reactors to generate heat and, subsequently, electricity. 

Llama<====>18071<====>Llama The llama ( ; or   ) (Lama glama) is a domesticated South American camelid, widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since the Pre-Columbian era.

Lexicon<====>18077<====>Lexicon A lexicon, word-hoard, or word-stock is the vocabulary of a person, language, or branch of knowledge (such as nautical or medical).   In linguistics, a lexicon is a language's inventory of lexemes.  The word "lexicon" derives from the Greek   (lexicon), neuter of   (lexikos) meaning "of or for words. " Linguistic theories generally regard human languages as consisting of two parts: a lexicon, essentially a catalogue of a language's words (its  ); and a grammar, a system of rules which allow for the combination of those words into meaningful sentences.  The lexicon is also thought to include bound morphemes, which cannot stand alone as words (such as most affixes). 

Leonardo da Vinci<====>18079<====>Leonardo da Vinci  Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci ( ; 15 April 1452 2 May 1519), more commonly Leonardo da Vinci or simply Leonardo, was an Italian Renaissance polymath whose areas of interest included invention, painting, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, writing, history, and cartography.  He has been variously called the father of palaeontology, ichnology, and architecture, and is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time.

Lacrosse<====>18080<====>Lacrosse    Lacrosse is a team sport played with a lacrosse stick and a lacrosse ball.  Players use the head of the lacrosse stick to carry, pass, catch, and shoot the ball into the goal. The sport has four versions that have different sticks, fields, rules and equipment: field lacrosse, women's lacrosse, box lacrosse and intercrosse.  The men's games, field lacrosse (outdoor) and box lacrosse (indoor), are contact sports and all players wear protective gear: helmet, gloves, shoulder pads, and elbow pads.  The women's game does not allow body contact but does allow stick to stick contact. 

Liverpool<====>18081<====>Liverpool    Liverpool ( ) is a city in North West England, with an estimated population of 484,578 in 2016 within the City of Liverpool borough.

The local authority is Liverpool City Council, the most populous local government district within the metropolitan county of Merseyside and the largest within the Liverpool City Region. Liverpool is located on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary, and historically lay within the ancient hundred of West Derby in the south west of the county of Lancashire. 

Long jump<====>18084<====>Long jump   The long jump (historically called the broad jump) is a track and field event in which athletes combine speed, strength and agility in an attempt to leap as far as possible from a take off point.   Along with the triple jump, the two events that measure jumping for distance as a group are referred to as the "horizontal jumps".  This event has a history in the Ancient Olympic Games and has been a modern Olympic event for men since the first Olympics in 1896 and for women since 1948. RulesAt the elite level, competitors run down a runway (usually coated with the same rubberized surface as running tracks, crumb rubber also vulcanized rubber—known generally as an all-weather track) and jump as far as they can from a wooden board 20 cm or 8 inches wide that is built flush with the runway into a pit filled with finely ground gravel or sand. 

Luke (name)<====>18085<====>Luke (name)   Luke   is a male given name, and less commonly, a surname. The name Luke is the English form of the Latin name  .

(The often seen derivation or explanation of   as "man from Lucania" is not supported by reliable sources. )Although the name is attested in ancient inscriptions, the best known historical use of the name is in the New Testament. 

Lonsdaleite<====>18087<====>Lonsdaleite Lonsdaleite (named in honour of Kathleen Lonsdale), also called hexagonal diamond in reference to the crystal structure, is an allotrope of carbon with a hexagonal lattice.  In nature, it forms when meteorites containing graphite strike the Earth.  The great heat and stress of the impact transforms the graphite into diamond, but retains graphite's hexagonal crystal lattice.  Lonsdaleite was first identified in 1967 from the Canyon Diablo meteorite, where it occurs as microscopic crystals associated with diamond.   Hexagonal diamond has also been synthesized in the laboratory (1966 or earlier; published in 1967)  by compressing and heating graphite either in a static press or using explosives. 

Labrador duck<====>18088<====>Labrador duck The Labrador duck (Camptorhynchus labradorius) was a North American bird; it has the distinction of being the first endemic North American bird species to become extinct after the Columbian Exchange, with the last known sighting occurring in 1878 in Elmira, New York.It was already a rare duck before European settlers arrived, and as a result of its rarity information on the Labrador duck is not abundant, although some, such as its habitat, characteristics, dietary habits and reasons behind its extinction, are known.  There are 55 specimens of the Labrador duck preserved in museum collections worldwide. 

Lettre de cachet<====>18089<====>Lettre de cachet  Lettres de cachet ( , lit.  "letters of the sign/signet") were letters signed by the king of France, countersigned by one of his ministers, and closed with the royal seal, or cachet.  They contained orders directly from the king, often to enforce arbitrary actions and judgments that could not be appealed. In the case of organized bodies, lettres de cachet  were issued for the purpose of preventing assembly or accomplishing some other definite act.   The provincial estates were convoked (called to assembly) in this manner, and it was by a lettre de cachet (in this case, a lettre de jussipri), or by showing in person in a lit de justice, that the king ordered a parlement to register a law despite that parlement's refusal to pass it.

Litre<====>18094<====>Litre    The litre (SI spelling) or liter (American spelling) (SI symbols L or l,  commonly, but incorrectly, abbreviated as ltr) is an SI accepted metric system unit of volume equal to 1 cubic decimetre (dm 3 ), 1,000 cubic centimetres (cm 3 ) or 1/1,000 cubic metre.  A cubic decimetre (or litre) occupies a volume of 10×10×10 centimetres (see figure) and is thus equal to one-thousandth of a cubic metre. The original French metric system used the litre as a base unit.  The word litre is derived from an older French unit, the litron, whose name came from Greek — where it was a unit of weight, not volume   — via Latin, and which equalled approximately 0. 

Lavr Kornilov<====>18096<====>Lavr Kornilov Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov ( ,  ; 18 August 1870 – 13 April 1918) was a military intelligence officer, explorer, and general in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I and the ensuing Russian Civil War.  He is today best remembered for the Kornilov Affair, an unsuccessful endeavor in August/September 1917 that purported to strengthen Alexander Kerensky's Provisional Government, but which led to Kerensky eventually having Kornilov arrested and charged with attempting a coup d'état, and ultimately undermined the rule of Kerensky; strengthening the claims and power of the soviets, and the Bolshevik party.    Pre-revolutionary careerOne story relates how Kornilov was originally born as a Don Cossack Kalmyk named Lorya Dildinov and adopted in Ust-Kamenogorsk, Russian Turkestan (now Kazakhstan) by the family of his mother's brother, the Russian Cossack Khorunzhiy George Kornilov, whose  wife was of Kazakh origin. 

L. L. Zamenhof<====>18100<====>L.  L.  Zamenhof  Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof ( ;   –  ),  usually credited as L.  L.  Zamenhof, was a Polish   medical doctor, inventor, and writer.  He is most widely known for creating Esperanto, the most successful constructed language in the world.   He grew up fascinated by the idea of a world without war and believed that this could happen with the help of a new international auxiliary language, which he first developed in 1873 while still in school.    BiographyZamenhof was born on 15 December (3 December OS) 1859 in the town of Białystok, Poland, at that time in the former Russian Empire as a result of the 18th-century partition of Poland. 

Linear map<====>18102<====>Linear map  In mathematics, a linear map (also called a linear mapping, linear transformation or, in some contexts, linear function) is a mapping   between two modules (including vector spaces) that preserves (in the sense defined below) the operations of addition and scalar multiplication.   An important special case is when  , in which case the map is called a linear operator,  or an endomorphism of  .  Sometimes the term linear function has the same meaning as linear map, while in analytic geometry it does not. A linear map always maps linear subspaces onto linear subspaces (possibly of a lower dimension);  for instance it maps a plane through the origin to a plane, straight line or point. 

Leyden jar<====>18103<====>Leyden jar A Leyden jar, or Leiden jar, is a device that "stores" static electricity between two electrodes on the inside and outside of a glass jar.   A Leyden jar typically consists of a glass jar with metal foil cemented to the inside and the outside surfaces, and a metal terminal projecting vertically through the jar lid to make contact with the inner foil.It was the original form of a capacitor (originally known as a "condenser"). It was invented independently by German cleric Ewald Georg von Kleist on 11 October 1745 and by Dutch scientist Pieter van Musschenbroek of Leiden (Leyden) in 1745–1746.

Lennon Wall<====>18109<====>Lennon Wall The Lennon Wall or John Lennon Wall is a wall in Prague, Czech Republic.  Once a normal wall, since the 1980s it has been filled with John Lennon-inspired graffiti and pieces of lyrics from Beatles' songs. In 1988, the wall was a source of irritation for the communist regime of Gustáv Husák.  Young Czechs would write grievances on the wall and in a report of the time this led to a clash between hundreds of students and security police on the nearby Charles Bridge.  The movement these students followed was described ironically as "Lennonism" and Czech authorities described these people variously as alcoholics, mentally deranged, sociopathic, and agents of Western capitalism. 

Los Angeles<====>18110<====>Los Angeles   Los Angeles ( ;  Spanish for "The Angels";  ), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L. A. , is the cultural, financial, and commercial center of Southern California.  With a U. S.  Census-estimated 2016 population of 3,976,322,  it is the second most populous city in the United States (after New York City) and the most populous city in the state of California.  Located in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over  , Los Angeles covers an area of about  . 

Lepus (constellation)<====>18111<====>Lepus (constellation) Lepus ( , colloquially  ) is a constellation lying just south of the celestial equator, immediately south of Orion.  Its name is Latin for hare.   Although the hare does not represent any particular figure in Greek mythology, Lepus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.  It is located below the constellation Orion (the hunter), and is sometimes represented as a hare being chased by Orion or, alternatively, by Orion's hunting dogs.  This constellation should not be confused with Lupus, the wolf. 

Lupus (constellation)<====>18112<====>Lupus (constellation)  Lupus   is a constellation located in the deep Southern Sky.  Its name is Latin for wolf.  Lupus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations, although it was previously an asterism associated with the neighboring constellation Centaurus. History and mythologyIn ancient times, the constellation was considered an asterism within Centaurus, and was considered to have been an arbitrary animal, killed, or about to be killed, on behalf of, or for, Centaurus.   An alternative visualization, attested by Eratosthenes, saw this constellation as a wineskin held by Centaurus. 

Lyra<====>18113<====>Lyra  Lyra ( ; Latin for lyre, from Greek λύρα)  is a small constellation.  It is one of 48 listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and is one of the 88 constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union.  Lyra was often represented on star maps as a vulture or an eagle carrying a lyre, and hence is sometimes referred to as Vultur Cadens or Aquila Cadens ("Falling Vulture"  or "Falling Eagle"), respectively.  Beginning at the north, Lyra is bordered by Draco, Hercules, Vulpecula, and Cygnus.  Lyra is visible from the northern hemisphere from spring through autumn, and nearly overhead, in temperate latitudes, during the summer months. 

Legnica<====>18115<====>Legnica Legnica   (archaic Polish: Lignica,  ,  ,  ) is a city in southwestern Poland, in the central part of Lower Silesia, on the Kaczawa River (left tributary of the Oder) and the Czarna Woda.  Between 1 June 1975 and 31 December 1998 Legnica was the capital of the Legnica Voivodeship.  It is currently the seat of the county and since 1992 the city has been the seat of a Diocese.  As of 2012, Legnica had a population of 102,708 inhabitants. The city was first referenced in chronicles dating from the year 1004, although previous settlements could be traced back to the 7th century. 

Liverpool F.C.<====>18119<====>Liverpool F. C. Liverpool Football Club ( ) is a professional football club in Liverpool, England, which competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football.  The club has won 5 European Cups, 3 UEFA Cups, 3 UEFA Super Cups, 18 League titles, 7 FA Cups, 8 League Cups, and 15 FA Community Shields. Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following year and has played at Anfield since its formation.  Liverpool established itself as a major force in English and European football in the 1970s and 1980s when Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley led the club to 11 League titles and seven European trophies. 

Lysosome<====>18120<====>Lysosome  A lysosome is a membrane-bound organelle found in nearly all  animal cells.  They are spherical vesicles which contain hydrolytic enzymes that can break down many kinds of biomolecules.  Simply stated, a lysosome is a type of vesicle with specific composition, of both its membrane proteins, and proteins of its lumen.   The lumen's pH (4. 5–5. 0)  is optimal for the enzymes involved in hydrolysis, analogous to the activity of the stomach.  Besides degradation of polymers, the lysosome is involved in various cell processes, including secretion, plasma membrane repair, cell signaling, and energy metabolism. 

Leg spin<====>18121<====>Leg spin   Leg spin is a type of spin bowling in the sport of cricket.  A leg spinner bowls right-arm with a wrist spin action, causing the ball to spin from right to left in the cricket pitch, at the point of delivery.  When the ball bounces, the spin causes the ball to deviate sharply from right to left, that is, away from the leg side of a right-handed batsman.  The same kind of trajectory, which spins from right to left on pitching, when performed by a left-arm bowler is known as left-arm orthodox spin bowling. 

Lisp machine<====>18123<====>Lisp machine  Lisp machines are general-purpose computers designed to efficiently run Lisp as their main software and programming language, usually via hardware support.  They are an example of a high-level language computer architecture, and in a sense, they were the first commercial single-user workstations.  Despite being modest in number (perhaps 7,000 units total as of 1988 ), Lisp machines commercially pioneered many now-commonplace technologies – including effective garbage collection, laser printing, windowing systems, computer mice, high-resolution bit-mapped raster graphics, computer graphic rendering, and networking innovations like Chaosnet.   Several firms built and sold Lisp machines in the 1980s: Symbolics (3600, 3640, XL1200, MacIvory, and other models), Lisp Machines Incorporated (LMI Lambda), Texas Instruments (Explorer and MicroExplorer), and Xerox (Interlisp-D workstations). 

Links (web browser)<====>18125<====>Links (web browser)  Links is an open source text and graphic web browser with a pull-down menu system.   It renders complex pages, has partial HTML 4. 0 support (including tables and frames    and support for multiple character sets such as UTF-8), supports color and monochrome terminals and allows horizontal scrolling. It is intended for users who want to retain many typical elements of graphical user interfaces (pop up windows, menus etc. ) in a text-only environment. The original version of Links was developed by Mikuláš Patočka in the Czech Republic.  His group, Twibright Labs, later developed version 2 of the Links browser, that displays graphics, renders fonts in different sizes (with spatial anti-aliasing) but does not support JavaScript any more (it used to, up to version 2. 

Learning object<====>18126<====>Learning objectA learning object is "a collection of content items, practice items, and assessment items that are combined based on a single learning objective".    The term is credited to Wayne Hodgins, and dates from a working group in 1994 bearing the name.   The concept encompassed by 'Learning Objects' is known by numerous other terms, including: content objects, chunks, educational objects, information objects, intelligent objects, knowledge bits, knowledge objects, learning components, media objects, reusable curriculum components, nuggets, reusable information objects, reusable learning objects, testable reusable units of cognition, training components, and units of learning. The core idea of the use of learning objects is characterized by the following: discoverability, reusability, and interoperability.

Louisiana<====>18130<====>Louisiana    	{{Infobox U. S.  state symbols }}Louisiana  is a state in the southeastern region of the United States.  It is the 31st in size and the 25th most populous of the 50 United States.  Louisiana's capital is Baton Rouge and its largest city is New Orleans.  It is the only state in the U. S.  with political subdivisions termed parishes, which are the local government's equivalent to counties.  The largest parish by population is East Baton Rouge Parish, and the largest by total area is Plaquemines.  Louisiana is bordered by Arkansas to the north, Mississippi to the east, Texas to the west, and the Gulf of Mexico to the south. 

Los Angeles International Airport<====>18131<====>Los Angeles International Airport    Los Angeles International Airport   is the largest and busiest airport in both the Greater Los Angeles Area and in the state of California, third busiest airport in the United States, and one of the largest international airports in the world.  The airport is most often referred to by its IATA airport code (and FAA LID) LAX, with the letters pronounced individually. LAX is in the southwestern Los Angeles area along the Pacific Ocean between the neighborhood of Westchester to its immediate north, the city of El Segundo to its immediate south and the city of Inglewood its immediate east. 

La Tène culture<====>18133<====>La Tène culture   The La Tène culture ( ;  ) was a European Iron Age culture named after the archaeological site of La Tène on the north side of Lake Neuchâtel in Switzerland, where thousands of objects had been deposited in the lake, as was discovered after the water level dropped in 1857.  La Tène is the type site and the term archaeologists use for the later period of the culture and art of the ancient Celts, a term that is firmly entrenched in the popular understanding, but presents numerous problems for historians and archaeologists.    The culture became very widespread, and presents a wide variety of local differences. 

Lorenz curve<====>18135<====>Lorenz curveIn economics, the Lorenz curve is a graphical representation of the distribution of income or of wealth.  It was developed by Max O.  Lorenz in 1905 for representing inequality of the wealth distribution. The curve is a graph showing the proportion of overall income or wealth assumed by the bottom x% of the people, although this is not rigorously true for a finite population (see below).  It is often used to represent income distribution, where it shows for the bottom x% of households, what percentage (y%) of the total income they have.  The percentage of households is plotted on the x-axis, the percentage of income on the y-axis. 

Literate programming<====>18136<====>Literate programming Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in which a program is given as an explanation of the program logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which a compilable source code can be generated.    The literate programming paradigm, as conceived by Knuth, represents a move away from writing programs in the manner and order imposed by the computer, and instead enables programmers to develop programs in the order demanded by the logic and flow of their thoughts. 

Logistic map<====>18137<====>Logistic mapThe logistic map is a polynomial mapping (equivalently, recurrence relation) of degree 2, often cited as an archetypal example of how complex, chaotic behaviour can arise from very simple non-linear dynamical equations.The map was popularized in a seminal 1976 paper by the biologist Robert May,    in part as a discrete-time demographic model analogous to the logistic equation first created by Pierre François Verhulst.  Mathematically, the logistic map is written where  x_n  is a number between zero and one that represents the ratio of existing population to the maximum possible population.

League of Nations mandate<====>18139<====>League of Nations mandate A League of Nations mandate was a legal status for certain territories transferred from the control of one country to another following World War I, or the legal instruments that contained the internationally agreed-upon terms for administering the territory on behalf of the League of Nations.  These were of the nature of both a treaty and a constitution, which contained minority rights clauses that provided for the rights of petition and adjudication by the International Court.   The mandate system was established under Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, entered into on 28 June 1919.

List of laser applications<====>18145<====>List of laser applications Many scientific, military, medical and commercial laser applications have been developed since the invention of the laser in 1958.  The coherency, high monochromaticity, and ability to reach extremely high powers are all properties which allow for these specialized applications. ScientificIn science, lasers are used in many ways, including:A wide variety of interferometric techniquesRaman spectroscopyLaser induced breakdown spectroscopyAtmospheric remote sensingInvestigating nonlinear optics phenomenaHolographic techniques employing lasers also contribute to a number of measurement techniques. Laser based lidar (LIght raDAR) technology has application in geology, seismology, remote sensing and atmospheric physics. Lasers have been used aboard spacecraft such as in the Cassini-Huygens mission. 

Left-arm orthodox spin<====>18148<====>Left-arm orthodox spin   Left-arm orthodox spin also known as Slow Left Arm Orthodox spin bowling is a type of Left Arm Finger Leg spin bowling in the sport of cricket.   Left-arm orthodox spin is bowled by a left-arm bowler using the fingers to spin the ball from right to left of the cricket pitch (from the bowler's perspective). Left arm orthodox spin bowlers generally attempt to drift the ball in the air into a right-handed batsman, and then turn it away from the batsman (towards off-stump) upon landing on the pitch.  The drift and turn in the air are attacking techniques. 

Laser construction<====>18151<====>Laser construction A laser is constructed from three principal parts:An energy source (usually referred to as the pump or pump source),A gain medium or laser medium, andTwo or more mirrors that form an optical resonator. Pump sourceThe pump source is the part that provides energy to the laser system.   Examples of pump sources include electrical discharges, flashlamps, arc lamps, light from another laser, chemical reactions and even explosive devices.   The type of pump source used principally depends on the gain medium, and this also determines how the energy is transmitted to the medium.   A helium–neon (HeNe) laser uses an electrical discharge in the helium-neon gas mixture, a Nd:YAG laser uses either light focused from a xenon flash lamp or diode lasers, and excimer lasers use a chemical reaction. 

Logical conjunction<====>18152<====>Logical conjunction In logic, mathematics and linguistics, And (∧) is the truth-functional operator of logical conjunction; the and of a set of operands is true if and only if all of its operands are true.  The logical connective that represents this operator is typically written as   or  .  "A and B" is true only if A is true and B is true.  An operand of a conjunction is a conjunct. The term "logical conjunction" is also used for the greatest lower bound in lattice theory. Related concepts in other fields are:In natural language, the coordinating conjunction "and". 

Logical connective<====>18153<====>Logical connective  In logic, a logical connective (also called a logical operator, sentential connective, or sentential operator) is a symbol or word used to connect two or more sentences (of either a formal or a natural language) in a grammatically valid way, such that the value of the compound sentence produced depends only on that of the original sentences and on the meaning of the connective. The most common logical connectives are binary connectives (also called dyadic connectives) which join two sentences which can be thought of as the function's operands.  Also commonly, negation is considered to be a unary connective. 

Propositional calculus<====>18154<====>Propositional calculus Propositional calculus (also called propositional logic, statement logic, sentential calculus, sentential logic, or sometimes zeroth-order logic) is the branch of logic concerned with the study of propositions (whether they are true or false) that are formed by other propositions with the use of logical connectives.  First-order logic extends propositional logic by allowing a proposition to be expressed as constructs such as "for every", "exists", "equality" and "membership", whereas in proposition logic, propositions are thought of as atoms. ExplanationLogical connectives are found in natural languages.  In English for example, some examples are "and" (conjunction), "or" (disjunction),  "not” (negation) and "if" (but only when used to denote material conditional). 

Lazy evaluation<====>18155<====>Lazy evaluation In programming language theory, lazy evaluation, or call-by-need  is an evaluation strategy which delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed (non-strict evaluation) and which also avoids repeated evaluations (sharing). The sharing can reduce the running time of certain functions by an exponential factor over other non-strict evaluation strategies, such as call-by-name.  The benefits of lazy evaluation include: The ability to define control flow (structures) as abstractions instead of primitives. The ability to define potentially infinite data structures.  This allows for more straightforward implementation of some algorithms. 

Lemuridae<====>18156<====>Lemuridae Lemuridae is a family of strepsirrhine primates native to Madagascar, and the Comoros Islands.  They are represented by the Lemuriformes in Madagascar with one of the highest concentration of the lemurs.  One of five families commonly known as lemurs.  These animals were once thought to be the evolutionary predecessors of monkeys and apes, but this is no longer considered correct.  CharacteristicsLemurids are medium-sized arboreal primates, ranging from 32 to 56 cm in length, excluding the tail, and weighing from 0. 7 to 5 kg.  They have long, bushy tails and soft, woolly fur of varying coloration. 

Lucent<====>18157<====>Lucent  Lucent Technologies, Inc. , was an American multinational telecommunications equipment company headquartered in Murray Hill, New Jersey, in the United States.  It was established on September 30, 1996, through the divestiture of the former AT&T Technologies business unit of AT&T Corporation, which included Western Electric and Bell Labs.    Lucent was merged with Alcatel SA of France in a merger of equals on December 1, 2006, forming Alcatel-Lucent.Alcatel-Lucent was absorbed by Nokia in January 2016. NameLucent means "they shine" in Latin.   The name was applied in 1996 at the time of the split from AT&T. 

Lupercalia<====>18158<====>Lupercalia   Lupercalia was a very ancient, possibly pre-Roman pastoral annual festival,    observed in the city of Rome on February 15, to avert evil spirits and purify the city, releasing health and fertility.  Lupercalia subsumed Februa, an earlier-origin spring cleansing ritual held on the same date, which gives the month of February (Februarius) its name.  NameThe festival was originally known as   (Latin for the "Purifications" or "Purgings") after the   which was used on the day.   .   It was also known as   and gave its name to Juno Februalis, Februlis, or Februata in her role as its patron deity; to a god called Februus, and to February ( ), the month during which it occurred.

List of agnostics<====>18166<====>List of agnostics    Listed here are persons who have identified themselves as theologically agnostic.  Also included are individuals who have expressed the view that the veracity of a god's existence is unknown or inherently unknowable. List  Activists and authorsSaul Alinsky (1909–1972): American community organizer and writer; Rules for Radicals   Poul Anderson (1926–2001): American science fiction author Piers Anthony (born 1934): English-American writer of science fiction and fantasy Susan B.

Linked list<====>18167<====>Linked list In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements, in which linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory.  Instead, each element points to the next.  It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence.  Under the simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence.  This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration.  More complex variants add additional links, allowing efficient insertion or removal from arbitrary element references. 

Logic gate<====>18168<====>Logic gate In electronics, a logic gate is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.  Depending on the context, the term may refer to an ideal logic gate, one that has for instance zero rise time and unlimited fan-out, or it may refer to a non-ideal physical device  (see Ideal and real op-amps for comparison). Logic gates are primarily implemented using diodes or transistors acting as electronic switches, but can also be constructed using vacuum tubes, electromagnetic relays (relay logic), fluidic logic, pneumatic logic, optics, molecules, or even mechanical elements. 

Linear search<====>18171<====>Linear search  In computer science, linear search or sequential search is a method for finding a target value within a list.  It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched.  Linear search runs in at worst linear time and makes at most   comparisons, where   is the length of the list.  If each element is equally likely to be searched, then linear search has an average case of   comparisons, but the average case can be affected if the search probabilities for each element vary. 

Land mine<====>18172<====>Land mine   A land mine is an explosive device concealed under or on the ground and designed to destroy or disable enemy targets, ranging from combatants to vehicles and tanks, as they pass over or near it.  Such a device is typically detonated automatically by way of pressure when a target steps on it or drives over it, although other detonation mechanisms are also sometimes used.   A land mine may cause damage by direct blast effect, by fragments that are thrown by the blast, or by both. The name originates from the ancient practice of military mining, where tunnels were dug under enemy fortifications or troop formations. 

List of libertarian political parties<====>18173<====>List of libertarian political parties   Many countries and subnational political entities have libertarian political parties.

Loa<====>18175<====>Loa  Loa (also spelled lwa) are the spirits of Haitian Vodou and Louisiana Voodoo.   They are also referred to as "mystères" and "the invisibles" and are intermediaries between Bondye (French: Bon Dieu, meaning "good God")—the Supreme Creator, who is distant from the world—and humanity.  Unlike saints or angels, however, they are not simply prayed to, they are served.  They are each distinct beings with their own personal likes and dislikes, distinct sacred rhythms, songs, dances, ritual symbols, and special modes of service.  Contrary to popular belief, the loa are not deities in and of themselves; they are intermediaries for, and dependent on, a distant Bondye. 

Labour economics<====>18178<====>Labour economics    Efficiency of labour means the productive capacity or productivity of labour.  It refers to the quality and quantity of goods and services which can be produced over a given  time under certain conditions .  Labour economics seeks to understand the functioning and dynamics of the markets for wage labour. Labour markets or job markets function through the interaction of workers and employers.  Labour economics looks at the suppliers of labour services (workers) and the demanders of labour services (employers), and attempts to understand the resulting pattern of wages, employment, and income. 

Lammas<====>18179<====>Lammas    Lammas Day (Anglo-Saxon hlaf-mas, "loaf-mass"), is a holiday celebrated in some English-speaking countries in the Northern Hemisphere, usually between 1 August and 1 September.  It is a festival to mark the annual wheat harvest, and is the first harvest festival of the year.  On this day it was customary to bring to church a loaf made from the new crop, which began to be harvested at Lammastide, which falls at the halfway point between the summer Solstice and Autumn September Equinox. The loaf was blessed, and in Anglo-Saxon England it might be employed afterwards to work magic:  a book of Anglo-Saxon charms directed that the lammas bread be broken into four bits, which were to be placed at the four corners of the barn, to protect the garnered grain. 

Longmeadow, Massachusetts<====>18182<====>Longmeadow, Massachusetts  Longmeadow is a town in Hampden County, Massachusetts, in the United States.  The population was 15,784 at the 2010 census.    HistoryLongmeadow was first settled in 1644, and officially incorporated on October 17, 1783.  The town was originally farmland within the limits of Springfield.  It remained relatively pastoral until the street railway was built circa 1910, when the population tripled over a fifteen-year period.  After Interstate 91 was built in the wetlands on the west side of town, population tripled again between 1960 and 1975. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Longmeadow was best known as the site from which Longmeadow brownstone was mined. 

Relative direction<====>18183<====>Relative direction  The most common relative directions are left, right, forward(s), backward(s), up, and down.  No absolute direction corresponds to any of the relative directions.  This is a consequence of the translational invariance of the laws of physics: nature, loosely speaking, behaves the same no matter what direction one moves.  As demonstrated by the Michelson-Morley null result, there is no absolute inertial frame of reference.  There are definite relationships between the relative directions, however.  Left and right, forward and backward, and up and down are three pairs of complementary directions, each pair orthogonal to both of the others. 

Lizard<====>18184<====>Lizard   Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species,  ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains.  The group is paraphyletic as it excludes the snakes and Amphisbaenia which are also squamates.  Lizards range in size from chameleons and geckos a few centimeters long to the 3 meter long Komodo dragon. Most lizards are quadrupedal, running with a strong side-to-side motion.  Others are legless, and have long snake-like bodies.  Some such as the forest-dwelling Draco lizards are able to glide.  They are often territorial, the males fighting off other males and signalling, often with brightly colours, to attract mates and to intimidate rivals. 

List of deists<====>18185<====>List of deists This is a partial list of people who have been categorized as deists, the belief in a deity based on natural religion only, or belief in religious truths discovered by people through a process of reasoning, independent of any revelation through scripture or prophets.  They have been selected for their influence on Deism, or for their fame in other areas.  Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865), sixteenth president of the United States of America.  He never joined any church and has been described as a "Christian deist".  As a young man, he was religiously skeptical and sometimes ridiculed revivalists. 

Book of Leviticus<====>18187<====>Book of Leviticus    The Book of Leviticus ( ) is the third book of the Torah and the third book of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament).  The book addresses all the people of Israel (1:2) though some passages specifically address the priests (6:8).  Most of its chapters (1–7, 11–27) consist of God's speeches to Moses which he is commanded to repeat to the Israelites.  This takes place within the story of the Israelites' Exodus after they escaped Egypt and reached Mt.  Sinai (Exodus 19:1).  The Book of Exodus narrates how Moses led the Israelites in building the Tabernacle (Exodus 35–40) based on God's instructions (Exodus 25–31). 

L. Frank Baum<====>18188<====>L.  Frank Baum    Lyman Frank Baum (May 15, 1856 – May 6, 1919), better known as L.  Frank Baum, was an American author chiefly famous for his children's books, particularly The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and its sequels.  He wrote a total of 14 novels in the Oz series, plus 41 other novels, 83 short stories, over 200 poems, and at least 42 scripts.  He made numerous attempts to bring his works to the stage and the nascent medium of film; the 1939 adaptation of the first Oz book would become a landmark of 20th century cinema. 

Lake Ladoga<====>18189<====>Lake Ladoga  Lake Ladoga (  or  ;   [earlier in Finnish Nevajärvi];  ;  ) is a freshwater lake located in the Republic of Karelia and Leningrad Oblast in northwestern Russia just outside the outskirts of Saint Petersburg.  It is the largest lake entirely in Europe, and the 14th largest freshwater lake by area in the world.  Ladoga Lacus, a methane lake on Saturn's moon Titan, is named after the lake. EtymologyIn one of Nestor's chronicles from the 12th century he mentions a lake called "the Great Nevo", a clear link to the Neva River and, possibly furthermore, to Finnish nevo "sea" or neva "bog, quagmire". 

Language family<====>18190<====>Language family   A language family is a group of languages related through descent from a common ancestral language or parental language, called the proto-language of that family.  The term "family" reflects the tree model of language origination in historical linguistics, which makes use of a metaphor comparing languages to people in a biological family tree, or in a subsequent modification, to species in a phylogenetic tree of evolutionary taxonomy.  Linguists therefore describe the daughter languages within a language family as being genetically related.  According to Ethnologue the 7,099 living human languages are distributed in 141 different language families. 

Looe Island<====>18194<====>Looe Island  Looe Island ( , meaning island of the monk's enclosure), also known as St George's Island, and historically St Michael's Island is a small island a mile from the mainland town of Looe off Cornwall, England. According to local legend, Joseph of Arimathea landed here with the child Christ.   Some scholars, including Glyn Lewis, suggest the island could be Ictis, the location described by Diodorus Siculus as a centre for the tin trade in pre-Roman Britain.  The island is now owned and managed by the Cornwall Wildlife Trust charity where access  is carefully managed for the benefit of wildlife and landing is only possible via the Cornwall Wildlife Trust authorized boatman. 

LaTeX<====>18195<====>LaTeX  LaTeX (   ;  a shortening of Lamport TeX) is a document preparation system.   When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in WYSIWYG ("what you see is what you get") word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages.  The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document (such as article, book, and letter), to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italics), and to add citations and cross-references.  A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MikTeX is used to produce an output file (such as PDF or DVI) suitable for printing or digital distribution. 

List of saints<====>18196<====>List of saints    This is an incomplete list of Christian saints in alphabetical order by Christian name, but, where known and given, a surname, location, or personal attribute (included as part of the name) may affect the ordering. One list says there are 810 canonized Roman Catholic saints (who have been through the formal institutional process of canonization), although some give numbers in the thousands.  (Pope John Paul II alone canonized 110 individuals, plus many group canonizations such as 110 martyr saints of China, 103 Korean martyrs, 117 Vietnamese martyrs, Mexican Martyrs, Spanish martyrs and French revolutionary martyrs. 

Lebesgue measure<====>18198<====>Lebesgue measureIn measure theory, the Lebesgue measure, named after French mathematician Henri Lebesgue, is the standard way of assigning a measure to subsets of n-dimensional Euclidean space.  For n = 1, 2, or 3, it coincides with the standard measure of length, area, or volume.  In general, it is also called n-dimensional volume, n-volume, or simply volume.   It is used throughout real analysis, in particular to define Lebesgue integration.  Sets that can be assigned a Lebesgue measure are called Lebesgue measurable; the measure of the Lebesgue measurable set A is denoted by λ(A). Henri Lebesgue described this measure in the year 1901, followed the next year by his description of the Lebesgue integral. 

Lake Champlain<====>18201<====>Lake Champlain   Lake Champlain   (French: Lac Champlain) (Abenaki: Pitawbagok ) (Mohawk: Kaniatarakwà:ronte ) is a natural freshwater lake in North America mainly within the borders of the United States (in the states of Vermont and New York) but partially situated across the Canada–U. S.  border, in the Canadian province of Quebec.    The New York portion of the Champlain Valley includes the eastern portions of Clinton County and Essex County.  Most of this area is part of the Adirondack Park.  There are recreational opportunities in the park and along the relatively undeveloped coastline of Lake Champlain. 

Lambda calculus<====>18203<====>Lambda calculusLambda calculus (also written as λ-calculus) is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.  It is a universal model of computation that can be used to simulate any Turing machine and was first introduced by mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of his research of the foundations of mathematics. Lambda calculus consists of constructing lambda terms and performing reduction operations on them.  In the simplest form of lambda calculus, terms are built using only the following rules:Syntax  Name  Description x  Variable  A character or string representing a parameter or mathematical/logical value (λx. 

Lossy compression<====>18208<====>Lossy compression In information technology, lossy compression or irreversible compression is the class of data encoding methods that uses inexact approximations and partial data discarding to represent the content.  These techniques are used to reduce data size for storage, handling, and transmitting content.  Different versions of the photo of the cat above show how higher degrees of approximation create coarser images as more details are removed.  This is opposed to lossless data compression (reversible data compression) which does not degrade the data.  The amount of data reduction possible using lossy compression is much higher than through lossless techniques. 

Lossless compression<====>18209<====>Lossless compressionLossless compression is a class of data compression algorithms that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data.   By contrast, lossy compression permits reconstruction only of an approximation of the original data, though this usually improves compression rates (and therefore reduces file sizes). Lossless data compression is used in many applications.  For example, it is used in the ZIP file format and in the GNU tool gzip.  It is also often used as a component within lossy data compression technologies (e. g.  lossless mid/side joint stereo preprocessing by MP3 encoders and other lossy audio encoders). 

Larry Niven<====>18210<====>Larry Niven  Laurence van Cott Niven ( ; born April 30, 1938) is an American science fiction writer.   His best-known work is Ringworld (1970), which received Hugo, Locus, Ditmar, and Nebula awards.  The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America named him the 2015 recipient of the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award.    His work is primarily hard science fiction, using big science concepts and theoretical physics.  It also often includes elements of detective fiction and adventure stories.  His fantasy includes the series The Magic Goes Away, rational fantasy dealing with magic as a non-renewable resource. 

Linux distribution<====>18212<====>Linux distribution A Linux distribution (often abbreviated as distro) is an operating system made from a software collection, which is based upon the Linux kernel and, often, a package management system.  Linux users usually obtain their operating system by downloading one of the Linux distributions, which are available for a wide variety of systems ranging from embedded devices (for example, OpenWrt) and personal computers (for example, Linux Mint) to powerful supercomputers (for example, Rocks Cluster Distribution). A typical Linux distribution comprises a Linux kernel, GNU tools and libraries, additional software, documentation, a window system (the most common being the X Window System), a window manager, and a desktop environment. 

Los Angeles Dodgers<====>18213<====>Los Angeles Dodgers    The Los Angeles Dodgers are an American professional baseball team based in Los Angeles, California.  The Dodgers compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) West division.  Established in 1883 in Brooklyn, New York,  the team moved to Los Angeles before the 1958 season.They played for four seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum before moving to their current home of Dodger Stadium in  . The Dodgers as a franchise have won six World Series titles and 22 National League pennants. 

Louis Andriessen<====>18214<====>Louis Andriessen Louis Andriessen ( ; born 6 June 1939) is a Dutch composer and pianist based in Amsterdam.  He is a lecturer at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague.  He was recipient of the Gaudeamus International Composers Award in 1959. Life and careerAndriessen was born in Utrecht into a musical family, the son of the composer Hendrik Andriessen (1892–1981), brother of composers Jurriaan Andriessen (1925–1996) and Caecilia Andriessen (born 1931), and nephew of Willem Andriessen (1887–1964). Andriessen originally studied with his father and Kees van Baaren at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague, before embarking upon two years of study with Italian composer Luciano Berio in Milan and Berlin. 

Leonard Peltier<====>18217<====>Leonard Peltier Leonard Peltier (born September 12, 1944) is a Native American activist, a citizen of the Anishinabe & Dakota/Lakota Nations,  and member of the American Indian Movement (AIM).  In 1977, he was convicted and sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment for first-degree murder in the shooting of two Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents during a 1975 conflict on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Peltier's indictment and conviction have been the subject of much controversy; Amnesty International placed his case under the "Unfair Trials" category of its Annual Report: USA 2010.  Peltier is incarcerated at the United States Penitentiary, Coleman in Florida. 

LambdaMOO<====>18221<====>LambdaMOO LambdaMOO is an online community    of the variety called a MOO.   It is the oldest MOO today.  LambdaMOO was founded in late 1990 or early 1991 by Pavel Curtis at Xerox PARC.   Now hosted in the state of Washington, it is operated and administered entirely on a volunteer basis.   Guests are allowed, and membership is free to anyone with an e-mail address. LambdaMOO gained some notoriety when Julian Dibbell wrote a book called My Tiny Life describing his experiences there. 

Lorica segmentata<====>18223<====>Lorica segmentata   The lorica segmentata (segmented cuirass) is a type of personal armour used by soldiers of the Roman Empire, consisting of metal strips ("girth hoops" fashioned into circular bands), fastened to internal leather straps.  The Latin name was first used in the 16th century; the ancient form is unknown. The plates of lorica segmentata armour were soft iron inside and (some at least) were mild steel on the outside, making the plates hardened against damage without becoming brittle.   This was a deliberate act, called case hardening, and is carried out by enriching the surface iron with carbon from organic materials packed tightly around the piece which is then heated in a forge. 

Known Space<====>18224<====>Known Space  Known Space is the fictional setting of about a dozen science fiction novels and several collections of short stories written by Larry Niven.  It has also become a shared universe in the spin-off Man-Kzin Wars anthologies.  ISFDB catalogs all works set in the fictional universe that includes Known Space under the series name Tales of Known Space, which was the title of a 1975 collection of Niven's short stories.   The first-published work in the series, which was Niven's first published piece was "The Coldest Place", in the December 1964 issue of If magazine, edited by Frederik Pohl. 

LeRoy Homer Jr.<====>18225<====>LeRoy Homer Jr.    LeRoy Wilton Homer Jr.  (August 27, 1965 September 11, 2001) was the First Officer of United Airlines Flight 93, which was hijacked as part of the September 11 attacks in 2001, and crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all 37 passengers and seven crew members. BiographyHomer, son of a West German and an American soldier who was stationed in West Germany, grew up on Long Island in New York where he always dreamed of flying.  As a child, he assembled model airplanes, collected aviation memorabilia and read books on aviation. 

La Jetée<====>18230<====>La Jetée  La Jetée ( ) ("The Jetty", here referring to an outdoor viewing pier at an airport), is a 1962 French science-fiction featurette by Chris Marker.  Constructed almost entirely from still photos, it tells the story of a post-nuclear war experiment in time travel.  It is 28 minutes long and shot in black and white.  It won the Prix Jean Vigo for short film. The 1995 science-fiction film 12 Monkeys was inspired by and borrows several concepts directly from La Jetée. Plot summaryA man (Davos Hanich) is a prisoner in the aftermath of World War III in post-apocalyptic Paris, where survivors live underground in the Palais de Chaillot galleries. 

Little penguin<====>18232<====>Little penguin  The little penguin (Eudyptula minor) is the smallest species of penguin.  It grows to an average of   in height and   in length, though specific measurements vary by subspecies.   It is found on the coastlines of southern Australia and New Zealand, with possible records from Chile.  In Australia, they are often called fairy penguins because of their small size.  In New Zealand, they are more commonly known as little blue penguins or blue penguins owing to their slate-blue plumage.  They are also known by their Māori name: kororā. 

Lake Balaton<====>18233<====>Lake Balaton Lake Balaton ( ) is a freshwater lake in the Transdanubian region of Hungary.  It is the largest lake in Central Europe,  and one of the region's foremost tourist destinations.  The Zala River provides the largest inflow of water to the lake, and the canalised Sió is the only outflow. The mountainous region of the northern shore is known both for its historic character and as a major wine region, while the flat southern shore is known for its resort towns.  Balatonfüred and Hévíz developed early as resorts for the wealthy, but it was not until the late 19th century when landowners, ruined by Phylloxera attacking their grape vines, began building summer homes to rent out to the burgeoning middle classes. 

Libro de los juegos<====>18234<====>Libro de los juegos The Libro de los Juegos, ("Book of games"), or Libro de axedrez, dados e tablas, ("Book of chess, dice and tables", in Old Spanish) was commissioned by Alfonso X of Castile, Galicia and León and completed in his scriptorium in Toledo in 1283, Sonja Musser Golladay, "Los Libros de Acedrex Dados E Tablas: Historical, Artistic and Metaphysical Dimensions of Alfonso X’s Book of Games" (PhD diss. , University of Arizona, 2007), 31.  Although Golladay is not the first to assert that 1283 is the finish date of the Libro de Juegos, the a quo information compiled in her dissertation consolidates the range of research concerning the initiation and completion dates of the Libro de Juegos. 

Lithium citrate<====>18236<====>Lithium citrate Lithium citrate (Li 3 C 6 H 5 O 7 ) is a chemical compound of lithium and citrate that is used as a mood stabilizer in psychiatric treatment of manic states and bipolar disorder  .  There is extensive pharmacology of lithium, the active component of this salt. Lithia water contains various lithium salts, including the citrate.  An early version of Coca-Cola available in pharmacies' soda fountains called Lithia Coke was a mixture of Coca-Cola syrup and lithia water.  The soft drink 7Up was originally named "Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda" when it was formulated in 1929 because it contained lithium citrate. 

Lithium carbonate<====>18237<====>Lithium carbonate Lithium carbonate is an inorganic compound, the lithium salt of carbonate with the formula  .  This white salt is widely used in the processing of metal oxides. For the treatment of bipolar disorder, it is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.  UsesLithium carbonate is an important industrial chemical.  It forms low-melting fluxes with silica and other materials.  Glasses derived from lithium carbonate are useful in ovenware.  Lithium carbonate is a common ingredient in both low-fire and high-fire ceramic glaze. 

Lunar Roving Vehicle<====>18238<====>Lunar Roving Vehicle   The Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) or lunar rover is a battery-powered four-wheeled rover used on the Moon in the last three missions of the American Apollo program (15, 16, and 17) during 1971 and 1972.  It was popularly known as  "moon buggy", a play on the words "dune buggy". The LRV was transported to the Moon on the Apollo Lunar Module (LM) and, once unpacked on the surface, could carry one or two astronauts, their equipment, and lunar samples.  The three LRVs remain on the Moon. HistoryThe concept of a lunar rover predated Apollo, with a 1952–1954 series in Collier's Weekly magazine by Wernher von Braun and others, "Man Will Conquer Space Soon!" In this, von Braun described a six-week stay on the Moon, featuring 10-ton tractor trailers for moving supplies.

Named after the Kickapoo tribe native to the area.One of the nine Air Force Space Surveillance System (formerly NAVSPASUR) sites is located at Lake Kickapoo ( ). It is the master transmitter and the most powerful continuous wave (CW) station in the world, at 768 kW radiated power.External links  

Labyrinth<====>18245<====>Labyrinth   In Greek mythology, the labyrinth (Greek: λαβύρινθος labyrinthos) was an elaborate, confusing structure designed and built by the legendary artificer Daedalus for King Minos of Crete at Knossos.  Its function was to hold the Minotaur, the monster eventually killed by the hero Theseus.  Daedalus had so cunningly made the Labyrinth that he could barely escape it after he built it.  Although early Cretan coins occasionally exhibit branching (multicursal) patterns,  the single-path (unicursal) seven-course "Classical" design without branching or dead ends became associated with the Labyrinth on coins as early as 430 BC,  and similar non-branching patterns became widely used as visual representations of the Labyrinth – even though both logic and literary descriptions make it clear that the Minotaur was trapped in a complex branching maze. 

Lyon & Healy<====>18246<====>Lyon & Healy  Lyon & Healy is an American harp manufacturer based in Chicago, Illinois.  Their Chicago headquarters and manufacturing facility contains a showroom and concert hall.  George W.  Lyon and Patrick J.  Healy began the company in 1864 as a sheet music shop.

Lamborghini<====>18271<====>Lamborghini    Automobili Lamborghini S. p. A.  ( ) is an Italian brand and manufacturer of luxury supercars, sports cars, SUVs  based in Sant'Agata Bolognese and tractors Lamborghini Trattori in Pieve di Cento, Italy.  The company is owned by the Volkswagen Group through its subsidiary Audi. Ferruccio Lamborghini, an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S. p. A.  in 1963 to compete with established marques, including Ferrari.  The company gained wide acclaim in 1966 for the Miura sports coupé, which established rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive as the standard layout for high-performance cars of the era. 

LaGrand case<====>18272<====>LaGrand case The LaGrand case was a legal action heard before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) which concerned the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.  In the case the ICJ found that its own temporary court orders were legally binding and that the rights contained in the convention could not be denied by the application of domestic legal procedures. BackgroundOn January 7, 1982, brothers Karl-Heinz (1963-1999) and Walter Bernhard LaGrand (1962-1999) bungled an armed bank robbery in Marana, Arizona, United States, killing a man and severely injuring a woman in the process.  They were subsequently charged and convicted of murder and sentenced to death. 

Lotus 1-2-3<====>18273<====>Lotus 1-2-3  Lotus 1-2-3 is a discontinued spreadsheet program from Lotus Software (later part of IBM).  It was the IBM PC's first killer application, was hugely popular in the 1980s and contributed significantly to the success of the IBM PC.  The first spreadsheet, VisiCalc, had helped launch the Apple II as one of the earliest personal computers in business use.  With IBM's entry into the market, VisiCalc was slow to respond, and when they did, they launched what was essentially a straight port of their existing system in spite of the greatly expanded hardware capabilities.  Lotus' solution was marketed as a three-in-one integrated solution, which handled spreadsheet calculations, database functionality, and graphical charts, hence the name "1-2-3", though how much database capability was debatable given Lotus' sparse memory.

Liberation Day (Netherlands)<====>18278<====>Liberation Day (Netherlands) In the Netherlands, Liberation Day ( ) is celebrated each year on May the 5th to mark the end of the occupation by Nazi Germany during World War II. The nation was liberated largely by the First Canadian Army which included, in addition to Canadian forces, several British infantry divisions, the British I Corps and the 1st Polish Armoured Division as well as, at various times, American, Belgian, Dutch and Czechoslovak troops.  Parts of the country, in particular the south-east, were liberated by the British Second Army which included American and Polish airborne forces (see Operation Market Garden) and French airbornes (see Operation Amherst). 

Light pollution<====>18279<====>Light pollution Light pollution, also known as photopollution, is the presence of anthropogenic light in the night environment.  It is exacerbated by excessive, misdirected or obtrusive uses of light, but even carefully used light fundamentally alters natural conditions.  As a major side-effect of urbanization, it is blamed for compromising health, disrupting ecosystems and spoiling aesthetic environments. DefinitionsLight pollution is the adding-of/added light itself, in analogy to added sound, carbon dioxide, etc.  Adverse consequences are multiple; some of them may not be known yet.  Scientific definitions thus include the following:The degradation of photic habitat by artificial light. 

Lagrangian point<====>18285<====>Lagrangian point In celestial mechanics, the Lagrangian points ( ; also Lagrange points, L-points, or libration points) are positions in an orbital configuration of two large bodies where a small object affected only by gravity can maintain its position relative to the two large bodies.  The Lagrange points mark positions where the combined gravitational pull of the two large masses provides precisely the centripetal force required to orbit with them.  There are five such points, labeled L 1  to L 5 , all in the orbital plane of the two large bodies.  The first three are on the line connecting the two large bodies; the last two, L 4  and L 5 , each form an equilateral triangle with the two large bodies. 

Lucid dream<====>18286<====>Lucid dream A lucid dream is a dream during which the dreamer is aware of dreaming.  During lucid dreaming, the dreamer may be able to exert some degree of control over the dream characters, narrative, and environment.EtymologyThe term 'lucid dream' was coined by Dutch author and psychiatrist Frederik van Eeden in his 1913 article A Study of Dreams,  though descriptions of dreamers being aware that they are dreaming predates the actual term. HistoryAncientEarly references to the phenomenon are found in ancient Greek writing.  For example, the philosopher Aristotle wrote: 'often when one is asleep, there is something in consciousness which declares that what then presents itself is but a dream'. 

Light-emitting diode<====>18290<====>Light-emitting diodeA light-emitting diode (LED) is a two-lead semiconductor light source.  It is a p–n junction diode that emits light when activated.    led and LED.   When a suitable voltage is applied to the leads, electrons are able to recombine with electron holes within the device, releasing energy in the form of photons.  This effect is called electroluminescence, and the color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photon) is determined by the energy band gap of the semiconductor.  LEDs are typically small (less than 1 mm 2 ) and integrated optical components may be used to shape the radiation pattern. 

Luxembourgish<====>18291<====>Luxembourgish    Luxembourgish, Luxemburgish    ( )  or Letzeburgesch    (  or  )  (Luxembourgish: Lëtzebuergesch) is a West Germanic language that is spoken mainly in Luxembourg.  Worldwide, about 390,000 people speak Luxembourgish.  While it could be considered a standardized variety (i. e. , a dialect with a written form) of German, its official use in the state of Luxembourg and the existence of a separate regulatory body  has removed Luxembourgish, at least in part, from the domain of the Dachsprache Standard German.  Despite the lack of a sharp boundary between Luxembourgish and the neighboring German dialects, this has led several linguists (from Luxembourg as well as Germany) to regard it as a separate, yet closely related language. 

Lev Kuleshov<====>18292<====>Lev Kuleshov Lev Vladimirovich Kuleshov ( ;   – 29 March 1970) was a Russian and Soviet filmmaker and film theorist, one of the founders of the world's first film school, the Moscow Film School.  He was given the title People's Artist of the RSFSR in 1969.   He was intimately involved in development of the style of film making known as Soviet montage, especially its psychological underpinning, including the use of editing and the cut to emotionally influence the audience, a principle known as the Kuleshov effect.   He also developed the theory of creative geography, which is the use of the action around a cut to connect otherwise disparate settings into a cohesive narrative. 

Legacy system<====>18295<====>Legacy systemIn computing, a legacy system is an old method, technology, computer system, or application program, "of, relating to, or being a previous or outdated computer system. "   Often a pejorative term, referencing a system as "legacy" means that it paved the way for the standards that would follow it.  This can also imply that the system is out of date or in need of replacement. OverviewThe first use of the term legacy to describe computer systems probably occurred in the 1970s.   By the 1980s it was commonly used to refer to existing computer systems to distinguish them from the design and implementation of new systems. 

Lunar eclipse<====>18298<====>Lunar eclipse   Recent total eclipses April 15, 2014  October 8, 2014  April 4, 2015  September 28, 2015 A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes directly behind the Earth into its umbra (shadow).  This can occur only when the sun, Earth, and moon are aligned (in "syzygy") exactly, or very closely so, with the Earth in the middle.  Hence, a lunar eclipse can occur only the night of a full moon.  The type and length of an eclipse depend upon the Moon's location relative to its orbital nodes. A total lunar eclipse has the direct sunlight completely blocked by the earth's shadow. 

Liber Pontificalis<====>18303<====>Liber Pontificalis {{Infobox Medieval text }}The Liber Pontificalis (Latin for 'pontifical book' or Book of the Popes) is a book of biographies of popes from Saint Peter until the 15th century.  The original publication of the Liber Pontificalis stopped with Pope Adrian II (867–872) or Pope Stephen V (885–891),  but it was later supplemented in a different style until Pope Eugene IV (1431–1447) and then Pope Pius II (1458–1464).Although quoted virtually uncritically from the 8th to 18th century,  the Liber Pontificalis has undergone intense modern scholarly scrutiny.  The work of the French priest Louis Duchesne (who compiled the major scholarly edition), and of others has highlighted some of the underlying redactional motivations of different sections, though such interests are so disparate and varied as to render improbable one popularizer's claim that it is an "unofficial instrument of pontifical propaganda. 

Latin alphabet<====>18306<====>Latin alphabetThe Latin alphabet or the Roman alphabet is a writing system originally used by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language.  By way of its use throughout Europe in  English, French, and Germanic variants, Romanized writing has grown to become the preferred alphabet globally (see Latin script), being used officially in China (separate from its ideographic writing), and being semi-adopted by Slavic (Russia) and Baltic states.  The Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician abjad, which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. 

Lugh<====>18307<====>Lugh  Lugh or Lug ( ; modern Irish: Lú  ) is an important god of Irish mythology.  A member of the Tuatha Dé Danann, Lugh is portrayed as a youthful warrior hero, a king and saviour.  Olmsted, Garrett.  The Gods of the Celts and the Indo-Europeans.  University of Innsbruck, 1994.  p. 117  He is associated with skill, crafts and the arts Monaghan, Patricia.  The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore.  Infobase Publishing, 2004.  pp. 296-297  as well as with oaths, truth and the law.   He is sometimes interpreted as a sun god,  a storm god  or a sky god. 

Lanthanide<====>18308<====>Lanthanide  The lanthanide   or lanthanoid   series of chemical elements  comprises the fifteen metallic chemical elements with atomic numbers 57 through 71, from lanthanum through lutetium.    These fifteen lanthanide elements, along with the chemically similar elements scandium and yttrium, are often collectively known as the rare earth elements. The informal chemical symbol Ln is used in general discussions of lanthanide chemistry to refer to any lanthanide.  All but one of the lanthanides are f-block elements, corresponding to the filling of the 4f electron shell; depending on the source, either lanthanum or lutetium is considered a d-block element, but is included due to its chemical similarities with the other fourteen. 

Lucifer<====>18309<====>Lucifer   Lucifer (   ) is a name that, according to dictionaries of the English language,    refers to the Devil or to the planet Venus when appearing as the morning star. As a name for the Devil, the more common meaning in English, "Lucifer" is the rendering of the Hebrew word   in Isaiah ( ) given in the King James Version.  This Bible version took the word from the Latin Vulgate,    which translated הֵילֵל by the Latin word lucifer (uncapitalized),meaning "the morning star, the planet Venus", or, as an adjective, "light-bringing". 

Lambda phage<====>18310<====>Lambda phage  Enterobacteria phage λ (lambda phage, coliphage λ) is a bacterial virus, or bacteriophage, that infects the bacterial species Escherichia coli (E.  coli).   It was discovered by Esther Lederberg in 1950 when she noticed that streaks of mixtures of two E.  coli strains, one of which treated with ultraviolet light, was "nibbled and plaqued".    The wild type of this virus has a temperate lifecycle that allows it to either reside within the genome of its host through lysogeny or enter into a lytic phase (during which it kills and lyses the cell to produce offspring); mutant strains are unable to lysogenize cells- instead they grow and enter the lytic cycle after superinfecting an already lysogenized cell. 

Louis Armstrong<====>18313<====>Louis Armstrong   Louis Daniel Armstrong (August 4, 1901 – July 6, 1971), nicknamed Satchmo,  Satch, and Pops,  was an American trumpeter, composer, singer and occasional actor who was one of the most influential figures in jazz.  His career spanned five decades, from the 1920s to the 1960s, and different eras in the history of jazz.In 2017, he was inducted into the Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame.  Armstrong was born and raised in New Orleans.  Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an "inventive" trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance. 

Long Island<====>18315<====>Long Island    Long Island is a densely populated island off the East Coast of the United States, beginning at New York Harbor just 0. 35 miles (0. 56 km) from Manhattan Island and extending eastward into the Atlantic Ocean.  The island comprises four counties in the U. S.  state of New York: Kings and Queens counties (which comprise the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, respectively) in the west, and Nassau and Suffolk counties in the east.  However, many people in the New York metropolitan area (even those living in Brooklyn and Queens) colloquially use the term "Long Island" (or "The Island") to refer exclusively to Nassau and Suffolk counties, which are mainly suburban in character. 

Lower Peninsula of Michigan<====>18317<====>Lower Peninsula of Michigan  The Lower Peninsula of Michigan is the southern of the two major landmasses of the U. S.  state of Michigan, the other being the Upper Peninsula.  It is surrounded by water on all sides except its southern border, which it shares with Indiana and Ohio.  Although the Upper Peninsula is commonly referred to as "the U. P. " it is fairly uncommon for the Lower Peninsula to be called "the L. P. "Because of its recognizable shape, the Lower Peninsula is nicknamed "the mitten", with the eastern region identified as "The Thumb". 

Lake Toba<====>18318<====>Lake Toba Lake Toba ( ) is a large natural lake occupying the caldera of a supervolcano.  The lake is about   long,   wide, and up to   deep.  Located in the middle of the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, with a surface elevation of about  , the lake stretches from   to  .  It is the largest lake in Indonesia and also the largest volcanic lake in the world.    Lake Toba is the site of a massive supervolcanic eruption estimated at VEI 8 that occurred 69,000 to 77,000 years ago,    representing a climate-changing event. 

Lens (optics)<====>18320<====>Lens (optics)   A lens is a transmissive optical device that focuses or disperses a light beam by means of refraction.  A simple lens consists of a single piece of transparent material, while a compound lens consists of several simple lenses (elements), usually arranged along a common axis.  Lenses are made from materials such as glass or plastic, and are ground and polished or moulded to a desired shape.  A lens can focus light to form an image, unlike a prism, which refracts light without focusing.  Devices that similarly focus or disperse waves and radiation other than visible light are also called lenses, such as microwave lenses, electron lenses, acoustic lenses, or explosive lenses. 

Lamorna Birch<====>18322<====>Lamorna Birch    Samuel John "Lamorna" Birch, RA, RWS (7 June 1869 – 7 January 1955) was an English artist in oils and watercolours.  At the suggestion of fellow artist Stanhope Forbes, Birch adopted the soubriquet "Lamorna" to distinguish himself from Lionel Birch, an artist who was also working in the area at that time. BiographyLamorna Birch was born in Egremont, Cheshire, England.   He was self-taught as an artist, except for a brief period of study at the Académie Colarossi in Paris during 1895.  Birch settled in Lamorna, Cornwall in 1892.  Many of his most famous pictures date from this time and the beautiful Lamorna Cove is usually their subject matter. 

Library of Congress Classification<====>18327<====>Library of Congress Classification The Library of Congress Classification (LCC) is a system of library classification developed by the Library of Congress.  It is used by most research and academic libraries in the U. S.  and several other countries.    LCC should not be confused with LCCN, the system of Library of Congress Control Numbers assigned to all books (and authors), which also defines URLs of their online catalog entries, such as "82006074" and "   ".   The Classification is also distinct from Library of Congress Subject Headings, the system of labels such as "Boarding schools" and "Boarding schools—Fiction" that describe contents systematically. 

Library classification<====>18328<====>Library classification A library classification is a system of knowledge organization by which library resources are arranged according to subject.   Library classifications use a notational system that represents the order of topics in the classification and allows items to be stored in that order.  Library classification systems group related materials together, typically arranged in a hierarchical tree structure.  A different kind of classification system, called a faceted classification system, is also widely used which allows the assignment of multiple classifications to an object, enabling the classifications to be ordered in multiple ways.  The library classification numbers can be considered identifiers for resources but are distinct from the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) or International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) system. 

Lexus<====>18329<====>Lexus    is the luxury vehicle division of Japanese car maker  Toyota.  The Lexus marque is marketed in more than 70 countries and territories worldwide  and has become Japan's largest-selling make   of premium cars.  It has ranked among the 10 largest Japanese global brands in market value.Lexus is headquartered in Nagoya, Japan.  Operational centers are located in Brussels, Belgium and the U. S.  in Plano, Texas. Lexus originated from a corporate project to develop a new premium sedan, code-named F1, which began in 1983 and culminated in the launch of the Lexus LS in 1989. 

Transgender rights<====>18330<====>Transgender rights   A person may be considered to be a transgender person if their gender identity is inconsistent or not culturally associated with the sex they were assigned at birth, and consequently also with the gender role and social status that is typically associated with that sex.  They may have, or may intend to establish, a new gender status that accords with their gender identity.  Transsexual is generally considered a subset of transgender, Transgender Rights (2006,  ), edited by Paisley Currah, Richard M.  Juang, Shannon Minter  Thomas E.  Bevan, The Psychobiology of Transsexualism and Transgenderism (2014,  ), page 42: "The term transsexual was introduced by Cauldwell (1949) and popularized by Harry Benjamin (1966) [. 

Ligase<====>18331<====>Ligase  In biochemistry, a ligase is an enzyme that can catalyze the joining of two large molecules by forming a new chemical bond, usually with accompanying hydrolysis of a small pendant chemical group on one of the larger molecules or the enzyme catalyzing the linking together of two compounds, e. g. , enzymes that catalyze joining of C-O, C-S, C-N, etc.  In general, a ligase catalyzes the following reaction:Ab + C → A–C + bor sometimesAb + cD → A–D + b + c + d + e + fwhere the lowercase letters signify the small, dependent groups. 

Logo (programming language)<====>18334<====>Logo (programming language) Logo is an educational programming language, designed in 1967 by Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon.   "Logo" is not an acronym.  It was derived from the Greek logos meaning word or "thought" by Feurzeig,    to distinguish itself from other programming languages that were primarily numbers, not graphics or logic, oriented. A general-purpose language, Logo is widely known for its use of turtle graphics, in which commands for movement and drawing produced line graphics either on screen or with a small robot called a turtle.  The language was conceived to teach concepts of programming related to Lisp and only later to enable what Papert called "body-syntonic reasoning", where students could understand, predict and reason about the turtle's motion by imagining what they would do if they were the turtle. 

Last rites<====>18337<====>Last rites  The last rites, in Catholicism, are the last prayers and ministrations given to many Catholics when possible shortly before death.  The last rites go by various names and include various practices in different Catholic traditions.  They may be administered to those awaiting execution, mortally injured, or terminally ill.  But 'last rites' are also known in other religions. Latin Catholic Church The ministration known as the last rites in the Catholic Church does not constitute a distinct sacrament in itself.  It is rather a set of sacraments given to people who are perceived to be near death. 

Lamorna<====>18338<====>Lamorna    Lamorna ( ) is a village, valley and cove in west Cornwall, England, UK.  It is on the Penwith peninsula approximately   south of Penzance and lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB); almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park.  Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End.   .   The South West Coast Path passes through the cove.  According to the Post Office the population at the 2011 census is included in the civil parish of St BuryanToponymyFirst recorded as Nansmorno (in 1305), than Nansmurnou (1309), Nansmorne (1319), Nansmornou (1339), Nansmorna (1387) and Namorna (1388). 

Law of multiple proportions<====>18339<====>Law of multiple proportions In chemistry, the law of multiple proportions is one of the basic laws of stoichiometry used to establish the atomic theory, alongside the law of conservation of mass (matter) and the law of definite proportions.   It is sometimes called Dalton's Law after its discoverer, the British chemist John Dalton,who published it in the first part of the first volume of his "New System of Chemical Philosophy" (1803).   Here is the statement of the law:If two elements form more than one compound between them, then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers. 

Law of averages<====>18340<====>Law of averagesThe law of averages is the law that a particular outcome or event is inevitable or certain simply because it is statistically possible.    Depending on context or application it can be considered a valid common-sense observation or a misunderstanding of probability.  This notion can lead to fallacious thinking when one becomes convinced that a particular outcome must come soon simply because it has not occurred recently (e. g.  believing that because three consecutive coin flips yielded heads, the next coin flip must be virtually guaranteed to be tails). As invoked in everyday life, the "law" usually reflects wishful thinking or a poor understanding of statistics rather than any mathematical principle.

See also: outline of poetry.  What type of thing is literature?Literature can be described as all of the following:Communication – activity of conveying information.  Communication requires a sender, a message, and an intended recipient, although the receiver need not be present or aware of the sender's intent to communicate at the time of communication; thus communication can occur across vast distances in time and space. Written communication (writing) – representation of language in a textual medium through the use of a set of signs or symbols (known as a writing system). 

AvtoVAZ<====>18352<====>AvtoVAZ AvtoVAZ ( ) is the Russian automobile manufacturer formerly known as VAZ (Volzhsky Avtomobilny Zavod) (ВАЗ, Во́лжский автомоби́льный заво́д, or Volga Automobile Plant).   The products are better known to the world under the trade name Lada.  In the Soviet Union, its products used various names, including Zhiguli, Oka, and Sputnik which were phased out in the 1990s and replaced by Lada for the Russian market.  AvtoVAZ's majority owner is Alliance Rostec Auto B. V.  with 64,6%, which is a joint venture of the Renault-Nissan Alliance with 40,7% and Russian company Rostec with 21,2% of shares,  which means that the Renault-Nissan-Alliance owns about 26. 

Lundy<====>18353<====>Lundy   Lundy is the largest island in the Bristol Channel.  It lies   off the coast of Devon, England,  in the district of Torridge, about a third of the distance across the channel from Devon, England to South Wales.  Lundy gives its name to a British sea area and is one of the islands of England.   Lundy has been designated by Natural England as national character area 159, one of England's natural regions.  In 2007, Lundy had a resident population of 28 people, including volunteers.  These include a warden, ranger, island manager and farmer, as well as bar and house-keeping staff. 

Lindow Man<====>18356<====>Lindow Man Lindow Man, also known as Lindow II and (in jest) as Pete Marsh, is the preserved bog body of a man discovered in a peat bog at Lindow Moss near Wilmslow in Cheshire, North West England.  The human remains were found on 1 August 1984 by commercial peat-cutters.  Lindow Man is not the only bog body to have been found in the moss; Lindow Woman was discovered the year before, and other body parts have also been recovered.  The find, described as "one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of the 1980s",    caused a media sensation. 

Lombok<====>18360<====>Lombok Lombok is an island in West Nusa Tenggara province, Indonesia.   It forms part of the chain of the Lesser Sunda Islands, with the Lombok Strait separating it from Bali to the west and the Alas Strait between it and Sumbawa to the east.   It is roughly circular, with a "tail" (Sekotong Peninsula) to the southwest, about   across and a total area of about  .  The provincial capital and largest city on the island is Mataram.   It is somewhat similar in size and density with neighboring Bali and shares some cultural heritage, but is administratively part of Nusa Tenggara Barat along with sparsely populated Sumbawa. 

Lego<====>18362<====>LegoLego ( ;   stylized as LEGO) is a line of plastic construction toys that are manufactured by The Lego Group, a privately held company based in Billund, Denmark.  The company's flagship product, Lego, consists of colourful interlocking plastic bricks accompanying an array of gears, figurines called minifigures, and various other parts.  Lego pieces can be assembled and connected in many ways, to construct objects; vehicles, buildings, and working robots.  Anything constructed can then be taken apart again, and the pieces used to make other objects.The Lego Group began manufacturing the interlocking toy bricks in 1949. 

Li people<====>18364<====>Li people  The Li ( ; pinyin: Lí) or Hlai are an ethnic group, the vast majority of whom live off the southern coast of mainland China on Hainan Island,  where they are the largest minority ethnic group.  Divided into the five branches of the Qi, Ha, Run, Sai and Meifu,    the Li have their own distinctive culture and customs. BackgroundThey refer to themselves as the Hlai people, but they are sometimes colloquially known as "Sai" or "Say", and during the Sui Dynasty they were known by the name Liliao.  The Li form one of the 55 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People's Republic of China. 

Luminance<====>18365<====>Luminance  Luminance is a photometric measure of the  luminous intensity per unit area of light travelling in a given direction.  It describes the amount of light that passes through, is emitted or reflected from a particular area, and falls within a given solid angle.  The SI unit for luminance is candela per square metre (cd/m 2 ).  A non-SI term for the same unit is the "nit".  The CGS unit of luminance is the stilb, which is equal to one candela per square centimetre or 10 kcd/m 2 . ExplanationLuminance is often used to characterize emission or reflection from flat, diffuse surfaces.

Lycos also encompasses a network of email, webhosting, social networking, and entertainment websites. Corporate historyLycos is a university spin-off that began as a research project by Michael Loren Mauldin of Carnegie Mellon University's main Pittsburgh campus in 1994.  Lycos Inc.  was formed with approximately US $2 million in venture capital funding from CMGI.  Bob Davis became the CEO and first employee of the new company in 1995, and concentrated on building the company into an advertising-supported web portal. 

Luton Town F.C.<====>18367<====>Luton Town F. C. Luton Town Football Club   is a professional association football club based at Kenilworth Road, Luton, Bedfordshire since 1905.  Founded in 1885, it is nicknamed "the Hatters" and affiliated to the Bedfordshire County Football Association.  Its first-team is contesting the fourth tier of English football, League Two, during the 2017–18 season.  The club's history includes major trophy wins, several financial crises, numerous promotions and relegations, and some spells of sustained success.  It was perhaps most prominent between 1982 and 1992, when it was a member of English football's top division, at that time the First Division; the team won its only major honour, the Football League Cup, in 1988. 

Lunar calendar<====>18369<====>Lunar calendarA lunar calendar is a calendar based upon the monthly cycles of the Moon's phases (synodic months), in contrast to solar calendars, whose annual cycles are based only directly upon the solar year.  The most commonly used calendar, the Gregorian calendar, is a solar calendar system that originally evolved out of a lunar calendar system.  A purely lunar calendar is also distinguished from a lunisolar calendar, whose lunar months are brought into alignment with the solar year through some process of intercalation.  The details of when months begin varies from calendar to calendar, with some using new, full, or crescent moons and others employing detailed calculations. 

Mount Lykaion<====>18372<====>Mount Lykaion Mount Lykaion ( , Lýkaion Óros;  ) is a mountain in Arcadia, Greece.  Lykaion has two peaks: Stefani to the north and St.  Ilias ( , Agios Īlías) to the south where the altar of Zeus is located.  Cook, A. B.  Zeus, 81.  1914.  The northern peak is higher, 1,421 m, than the southern, 1,382 m ( ).  Mount Lykaion was sacred to Zeus Lykaios, who was said to have been born and brought up on it, and was the home of Pelasgus and his son Lycaon, who were said to have founded the ritual of Zeus practiced on its summit. 

Lake Eyre<====>18374<====>Lake Eyre    Lake Eyre (   ), officially known as Kati Thanda–Lake Eyre,    contains the lowest natural point in Australia, at approximately   below sea level (AHD), and, on the rare occasions that it fills, is the largest lake in Australia covering  .  The shallow endorheic lake is the   of the vast Lake Eyre basin and is found in Northern South Australia, some   north of Adelaide. When the lake is full, it has the same salinity level as the sea, but as the lake dries up and the water evaporates, salinity increases. 

Loran-C<====>18376<====>Loran-C Loran-C was a hyperbolic radio navigation system which allowed a receiver to determine its position by listening to low frequency radio signals transmitted by fixed land-based radio beacons.  Loran-C combined two different techniques to provide a signal that was both long-range and highly accurate, traits that had formerly been at odds.  The downside was the expense of the equipment needed to interpret the signals, which meant that Loran-C was used primarily by militaries after it was first introduced in 1957. By the 1970s the electronics needed to implement Loran-C had been dramatically reduced due to the introduction of solid state radio electronics, and especially the use of early microcontrollers to interpret the signal. 

Lunatic<====>18377<====>Lunatic  Lunatic is an informal term referring to a person who is considered as mentally ill, dangerous, foolish or unpredictable, conditions once attributed to lunacy.  The term may be considered insulting in serious contexts in modern times, but is now more likely to be used in friendly jest.  The word derives from lunaticus meaning "of the moon" or "moonstruck".  The term was once commonly used in law.    HistoryThe term "lunatic" derives from the Latin word  , which originally referred mainly to epilepsy and  , as diseases thought to be caused by the moon. 

Linear timecode<====>18379<====>Linear timecode Linear (or Longitudinal) Timecode (LTC) is an encoding of SMPTE timecode data in an audio signal, as defined in SMPTE 12M specification.  The audio signal is commonly recorded on a VTR track or other storage media.   The bits are encoded using the biphase mark code (also known as FM):  a 0 bit has a single transition at the start of the bit period.   A 1 bit has two transitions, at the beginning and middle of the period.   This encoding is self-clocking.  Each frame is terminated by a 'sync word' which has a special predefined sync relationship with any video or film content. 

John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh<====>18381<====>John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh   John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh,   ( ; 12 November 1842 – 30 June 1919) was a physicist who, with William Ramsay, discovered argon, an achievement for which he earned the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1904.  He also discovered the phenomenon now called Rayleigh scattering, which can be used to explain why the sky is blue, and predicted the existence of the surface waves now known as Rayleigh waves.  Rayleigh's textbook, The Theory of Sound, is still referred to by acoustic engineers today. BiographyStrutt was born on 12 November 1842 at Langford Grove in Maldon, Essex. 

Lunisolar calendar<====>18382<====>Lunisolar calendarA lunisolar calendar is a calendar in many cultures whose date indicates both the moon phase and the time of the solar year.  If the solar year is defined as a tropical year, then a lunisolar calendar will give an indication of the season; if it is taken as a sidereal year, then the calendar will predict the constellation near which the full moon may occur.  As with all calendars which divide the year into months there is an additional requirement that the year have a whole number of months.   In this case ordinary years consist of twelve months but every second or third year is an embolismic year, which adds a thirteenth intercalary, embolismic, or leap month. 

Leonids<====>18383<====>Leonids  The Leonids (   ) are a prolific meteor shower associated with the comet Tempel–Tuttle.  The Leonids get their name from the location of their radiant in the constellation Leo: the meteors appear to radiate from that point in the sky.  Their proper Greek name should be Leontids (Λεοντίδαι, Leontídai), but the word was initially constructed as a Greek/Latin hybrid  and it has been used since.  They peak in the month of November. Earth moves through the meteoroid stream of particles left from the passages of a comet.  The stream comprises solid particles, known as meteoroids, ejected by the comet as its frozen gases evaporate under the heat of the Sun when it is close enough – typically closer than Jupiter's orbit. 

Labarum<====>18384<====>Labarum The labarum ( ) was a vexillum (military standard) that displayed the "Chi-Rho" symbol  ☧ , a christogram formed from the first two Greek letters of the word "Christ" ( , or Χριστός) — Chi (χ) and Rho (ρ).   It was first used by the Roman emperor Constantine the Great.  Since the vexillum consisted of a flag suspended from the crossbar of a cross, it was ideally suited to symbolize the crucifixion of Christ. Ancient sources draw an unambiguous distinction between the two terms "labarum" and "Chi-Rho", even though later usage sometimes regards the two as synonyms. 

Lactantius<====>18385<====>Lactantius Lucius Caecilius Firmianus Lactantius (c.  250 – c.  325) was an early Christian author who became an advisor to the first Christian Roman emperor, Constantine I, guiding his religious policy as it developed,  and a tutor to his son. BiographyLactantius, a Latin-speaking North African of Berber origin,was not born into a Christian family.  He was a pupil of Arnobius who taught at Sicca Veneria, an important city in Numidia.  In his early life, he taught rhetoric in his native town, which may have been Cirta in Numidia, where an inscription mentions a certain "L. 

Laconia<====>18386<====>Laconia  {{Infobox settlement }}Laconia ( ), also known as Lacedaemonia, is a region in the southeastern part of the Peloponnese peninsula.  Its administrative capital is Sparta.  The word laconic is derived from the name of the region by analogy—to speak in a concise way, as the Spartans were reputed by the Athenians to do. GeographyLaconia is bordered by Messenia to the west and Arcadia to the north and is surrounded by the Myrtoan Sea to the east and by the Laconian Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.  It encompasses Cape Malea and Cape Tainaron and a large part of the Mani Peninsula.

Laocoön<====>18388<====>Laocoön Laocoön ( ;    ,  ),  the son of Acoetes, is a figure in Greek and Roman mythology and the Epic Cycle.    He was a Trojan priest who was attacked, with his two sons, by giant serpents sent by the gods.  Though not mentioned by Homer, the story of Laocoön had been the subject of a tragedy, now lost, by Sophocles and was mentioned by other Greek writers, though the events around the attack by the serpents vary considerably.  The most famous account of these is now in Virgil's Aeneid where Laocoön was a priest of Poseidon (or Neptune for the Romans), who was killed with both his sons after attempting to expose the ruse of the Trojan Horse by striking it with a spear. 

Limburg an der Lahn<====>18389<====>Limburg an der Lahn  Limburg an der Lahn (officially abbreviated Limburg a.  d.  Lahn) is the district seat of Limburg-Weilburg in Hesse, Germany. GeographyLocationLimburg lies in western Hessen between the Taunus and the Westerwald on the river Lahn. The town lies roughly centrally in a basin within the Rhenish Slate Mountains which is surrounded by the low ranges of the Taunus and Westerwald and called the Limburg Basin (Limburger Becken).  Owing to the favourable soil and climate, the Limburg Basin stands as one of Hesse's richest agricultural regions and moreover, with its convenient Lahn crossing, it has been of great importance to transport since the Middle Ages. 

Lavrentiy Beria<====>18390<====>Lavrentiy Beria   Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria ( ,  ,  ;  ; 29 March 1899 – 23 December 1953) was a Soviet politician of Georgian ethnicity, Marshal of the Soviet Union and state security administrator, chief of the Soviet security and secret police apparatus (NKVD) under Joseph Stalin during World War II, and promoted to deputy premier under Stalin from 1941.  He later officially joined the Politburo in 1946. Beria was the longest-lived and most influential of Stalin's secret police chiefs, wielding his most substantial influence during and after World War II.   He simultaneously administered vast sections of the Soviet state and acted as the de facto Marshal of the Soviet Union in command of NKVD field units responsible for barrier troops and Soviet partisan intelligence and sabotage operations on the Eastern Front during World War II. 

Lyonel Feininger<====>18391<====>Lyonel Feininger Lyonel Charles Feininger (July 17, 1871 January 13, 1956) was a German-American painter, and a leading exponent of Expressionism.  He also worked as a caricaturist and comic strip artist.  He was born and grew up in New York City, traveling to Germany at 16 to study and perfect his art.  He started his career as a cartoonist in 1894 and met with much success in this area.  He was also a commercial caricaturist for 20 years for magazines and newspapers in the USA and Germany.  At the age of 36, he started to work as a fine artist. 

Life<====>18393<====>Life  Life is a characteristic that distinguishes physical entities that do have biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased, or because they never had such functions and are classified as  .  Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria.  The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses, viroids, or potential artificial life as "living".  Biology is the primary science concerned with the study of life, although many other sciences are involved. 

La Espero<====>18398<====>La Espero  "La Espero" ( ) is a poem written by Polish-Jewish oculist and doctor L.  L.  Zamenhof (1859–1917), the initiator of the Esperanto language.  The song is often used as the anthem of Esperanto, and is now usually sung to a triumphal march composed by Félicien Menu de Ménil in 1909 (although there is an earlier, less martial tune created in 1891 by Claes Adelsköld, as well as a number of others less well-known).  It is sometimes referred to as the hymn of the Esperanto movement. Some Esperantists object to the use of terms like "hymn" or "anthem" for La Espero, arguing that these terms have religious and nationalist overtones respectively. 

Loonie<====>18400<====>Loonie   The Canadian one dollar coin, commonly called the loonie ( ), is a gold-coloured one-dollar coin introduced in 1987.  It bears images of a common loon, a bird which is common and well known in Canada, on the reverse, and of Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse.  It is produced by the Royal Canadian Mint at its facility in Winnipeg. The coin's outline is an 11-sided curve of constant width.  Its diameter of 26. 5 mm and its 11-sidedness matched that of the already-circulating Susan B.  Anthony dollar in the United States, and its thickness of 1. 

Laminar flow<====>18401<====>Laminar flowIn fluid dynamics, laminar flow (or streamline flow) occurs when a fluid flows in parallel layers, with no disruption between the layers.At low velocities, the fluid tends to flow without lateral mixing, and adjacent layers slide past one another like playing cards.  There are no cross-currents perpendicular to the direction of flow, nor eddies or swirls of fluids.In laminar flow, the motion of the particles of the fluid is very orderly with particles close to a solid surface moving in straight lines parallel to that surface.  Laminar flow is a flow regime characterized by high momentum diffusion and low momentum convection. 

Luanda<====>18402<====>LuandaLuanda, formerly named São Paulo da Assunção de Loanda, is the capital and largest city in Angola, and the country's most populous and important city, primary port and major industrial, cultural and urban centre.  Located on Angola's coast with the Atlantic Ocean, Luanda is both Angola's chief seaport and its administrative centre.  It has a metropolitan population of over 6 million.  It is also the capital city of Luanda Province, and the world's third most populous Portuguese-speaking city, behind only São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, both in Brazil, and the most populous Portuguese-speaking capital city in the world, ahead of Brasília, Maputo and Lisbon. 

Logical positivism<====>18403<====>Logical positivism Logical positivism and logical empiricism, which together formed neopositivism, was a movement in Western philosophy whose central thesis was verificationism, a theory of knowledge which asserted that only statements verifiable through empirical observation are cognitively meaningful.   The movement flourished in the 1920s and 1930s in several European centers.   Efforts to convert philosophy to this new "scientific philosophy", shared with empirical sciences' best examples, such as Einstein's general theory of relativity, sought to prevent confusion rooted in unclear language and unverifiable claims.   The Berlin Circle and Vienna Circle—groups of philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians in Berlin and Vienna—propounded logical positivism, starting in the late 1920s. 

Lorentz transformation<====>18404<====>Lorentz transformation In physics, the Lorentz transformations (or transformation) are coordinate transformations between two coordinate frames that move at constant velocity relative to each other.  The transformations are named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz. Frames of reference can be divided into two groups: inertial (relative motion with constant velocity) and non-inertial (accelerating in curved paths, rotational motion with constant angular velocity, etc. ).  The term "Lorentz transformations" only refers to transformations between inertial frames, usually in the context of special relativity.  In each reference frame, an observer can use a local coordinate system (most exclusively Cartesian coordinates in this context) to measure lengths, and a clock to measure time intervals.

Luminiferous aether<====>18406<====>Luminiferous aetherIn the late 19th century, luminiferous aether, aether, or ether, meaning light-bearing aether, was the postulated medium for the propagation of light.   It was invoked to explain the ability of the apparently wave-based light to propagate through empty space, something that waves should not be able to do.  The assumption of a spatial plenum of luminiferous aether, rather than a spatial vacuum, provided the theoretical medium that was required by wave theories of light. The concept was the topic of considerable debate throughout its history, as it required the existence of an invisible and infinite material with no interaction with physical objects. 

LAME<====>18408<====>LAME   LAME is a software encoder that converts audio to the MP3 file format.  LAME is a free software project was first released in 1998, and has incorporated many improvements since then, including an improved psychoacoustic model.  The LAME encoder outperforms early encoders like L3enc.  LAME is required by some programs.  In many programs released as free software (e. g. , Audacity), LAME must be linked for MP3 support.  This avoided including LAME itself, which used patented techniques, and so required patent licenses in many countries. History The name LAME is a recursive acronym for "LAME Ain't an MP3 Encoder". 

Leszek Miller<====>18414<====>Leszek Miller  Leszek Cezary Miller   (born 3 July 1946) is a Polish left-wing politician who served as Prime Minister of Poland from 2001 to 2004.  He was leader of the Democratic Left Alliance to 2016. Childhood and youthBorn in Żyrardów, Miller comes from a poor, working-class family: His father was a tailor and his mother a needlewoman.  His parents broke up when Leszek was six months old.  His father, Florian Miller, an ethnic German, left the family and Leszek has never maintained any contact with him.   His mother brought him up in a religious spirit – following her wish, he was even, for some time, an altar boy in their church. 

Basis (linear algebra)<====>18420<====>Basis (linear algebra)  In mathematics, a set of elements (vectors) in a vector space V is called a basis, or a set of  , if the vectors are linearly independent and every vector in the vector space is a linear combination of this set.    In more general terms, a basis is a linearly independent spanning set. Given a basis of a vector space V, every element of V can be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of basis vectors, whose coefficients are referred to as vector coordinates or components.   A vector space can have several distinct sets of basis vectors; however each such set has the same number of elements, with this number being the dimension of the vector space. 

Linear algebra<====>18422<====>Linear algebra Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations such as  a_1x_1+\cdots +a_nx_n=b, linear functions such as (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \mapsto a_1x_1+\ldots +a_nx_n, and their representations through matrices and vector spaces.    Linear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics.  For instance, linear algebra is fundamental in modern presentations of geometry, including for defining basic objects such as lines, planes and rotations.  Also, functional analysis may be basically viewed as the application of linear algebra to spaces of functions.  Linear algebra is also used in most sciences and engineering areas, because it allows modeling many natural phenomena, and efficiently computing with such models. 

Labia majora<====>18423<====>Labia majora The labia majora (singular: labium majus) are two prominent longitudinal cutaneous folds that extend downward and backward from the mons pubis to the perineum.  Together with the labia minora they form the labia of the vulva. The labia majora are homologous to the male scrotum. EtymologyLabia majora is the Latin plural for big ("major") lips; the singular is labium majus.  The Latin term labium/labia is used in anatomy for a number of usually paired parallel structures, but in English it is mostly applied to two pairs of parts of female external genitals (vulva)—labia majora and labia minora. 

Labia minora<====>18424<====>Labia minora The labia minora (the Latin for smaller lips, singular: labium minus "smaller lip"), also known as the inner labia, inner lips, vaginal lips or nymphae,  are two flaps of skin on either side of the human vaginal opening in the vulva, situated between the labia majora (the Latin for larger lips; also called outer labia, or outer lips).  The labia minora vary widely in size, color, and shape from individual to individual. Structure and functioningThe labia minora extend from the clitoris obliquely downward, laterally, and backward on either side of the vulval vestibule, ending between the bottom of the vulval vestibule and the labia majora. 

Leopold von Sacher-Masoch<====>18425<====>Leopold von Sacher-Masoch Leopold Ritter  von Sacher-Masoch (27 January 1836 – 9 March 1895) was an Austrian writer and journalist, who gained renown for his romantic stories of Galician life.  The term   is derived from his name. During his lifetime, Sacher-Masoch was well known as a man of letters, a utopian thinker who espoused socialist and humanist ideals in his fiction and non-fiction.  Most of his works remain untranslated into English.  Until recently, his novel Venus in Furs was his only book commonly available in English, but an English translation by William Holmes  of Die Gottesmutter was released in 2015 as The Mother of God. 

Lithography<====>18426<====>Lithography  Lithography ( ) is a method of printing originally based on the immiscibility of oil and water.   The printing is from a stone (lithographic limestone) or a metal plate with a ball grained surface.  It was invented in 1796 by German author and actor Alois Senefelder as a cheap method of publishing theatrical works.  Meggs, Philip B.  A History of Graphic Design.

Library management<====>18430<====>Library management Library management is a sub-discipline of institutional management that focuses on specific issues faced by libraries and library management professionals.  Library management encompasses normal managerial tasks, as well as intellectual freedom and fundraising responsibilities.  Issues faced in library management frequently overlap with those faced in managing non-profit organizations.  The basic functions of library management include, but are not limited to: planning and negotiating the acquisition of materials, Interlibrary Loan (ILL) requests, stacks maintenance, overseeing fee collection, event planning, fundraising, and human resources.  Common library constructMost libraries that store physical media like books, periodicals, film, and other objects adhere to some derivative of the Dewey Decimal System as their method for tagging, storing, and retrieving materials based on unique identifiers. 

English longbow<====>18432<====>English longbowThe English longbow  was a powerful medieval type of longbow (a tall bow for archery) about   long used by the English and Welsh for hunting and as a weapon in medieval warfare.  English use of longbows was effective against the French during the Hundred Years' War, particularly at the start of the war in the battles of Sluys (1340), Crécy (1346), and Poitiers (1356), and perhaps most famously at the Battle of Agincourt (1415).  They were less successful after this, with longbowmen having their lines broken at the Battle of Verneuil (1424), and being completely routed at the Battle of Patay (1429) when they were charged before they had set up their defensive position.

Known for his distinctive voice and premature white hair, Marvin initially appeared in supporting roles, mostly villains, soldiers, and other hardboiled characters.  A prominent television role was that of Detective Lieutenant Frank Ballinger in the NBC crime series M Squad (1957–1960). One of Marvin's most notable film projects was Cat Ballou (1965), a comedy Western in which he played dual roles.  For portraying both gunfighter Kid Shelleen and criminal Tim Strawn, he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, along with a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, an NBR Award, and the Silver Bear for Best Actor. 

Lead Belly<====>18434<====>Lead Belly  Huddie William Ledbetter    (January 20, 1888  – December 6, 1949) was an American folk and blues musician notable for his strong vocals, virtuosity on the twelve-string guitar, and the folk standards he introduced.  He is best known as Lead Belly.  Though many releases credit him as "Leadbelly", he himself wrote it as "Lead Belly", which is also the spelling on his tombstoneand the spelling used by the Lead Belly Foundation.  Lead Belly usually played a twelve-string guitar, but he also played the piano, mandolin, harmonica, violin, and "windjammer" (diatonic accordion).

Loch<====>18444<====>Loch  Loch ( ) is the Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Scots word for a lake or for a sea inlet.  It is cognate with the Manx lough, Cornish logh, and the Welsh word for lake, llyn. In English English and Hiberno-English, the anglicised spelling lough (  or  ) is commonly found in place names; in Lowland Scots and Scottish English, the spelling "loch" is always used. Some lochs could also be called firths, fjords, estuaries, straits or bays.  Sea-inlet lochs are often called sea lochs or sea loughs.  Many loughs are connected to stories of lake-bursts, signifying their mythical origin. 

Leo Marks<====>18446<====>Leo Marks   Leopold Samuel "Leo" Marks, MBE (24 September 1920 – 15 January 2001) was an English writer, screenwriter, and cryptographer.  During the Second World War he headed the codes office supporting resistance agents in occupied Europe for the secret Special Operations Executive organisation.  After the war, Marks became a playwright and screenwriter, writing scripts that frequently utilised his war-time cryptographic experiences.  He wrote the script for Peeping Tom, the controversial film directed by Michael Powell which had a disastrous effect on Powell's career, but  has subsequently been described by Martin Scorsese as a  masterpiece. 

Livonia<====>18448<====>Livonia  Livonia ( ,  , German and Scandinavian languages:  , Latvian and  ,  , archaic English Livland,    Liwlandia;  ) is a historical region on the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea.  Originally named after the Livonians, who lived on the shores of present-day Latvia, the term was first used to denote the area inhabited by the Livonian tribes. By the end of the 13th century the name was extended to most of present-day Estonia and Latvia that had been conquered during the Livonian Crusade (1193–1290) by the Livonian Brothers of the Sword. 

Lung cancer<====>18450<====>Lung cancer    Lung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma,    is a malignant lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung.   This growth can spread beyond the lung by the process of metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body.   Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas.   The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains. 

Lists of office-holders<====>18452<====>Lists of office-holders  These are lists of incumbents (individuals holding offices or positions), including heads of states or of subnational entities. A historical discipline, archontology, focuses on the study of past and current office holders. Incumbents may also be found in the countries' articles (main article and "Politics of") and the list of national leaders, recent changes in 2007 in politics, and past leaders on State leaders by year and Colonial governors by year. Various articles group lists by title, function or topic: e. g.  abdication, assassinated persons, cabinet (government), chancellor, ex-monarchs (20th century), head of government, head of state, lieutenant governor, mayor, military commanders, minister (and ministers by portfolio below), order of precedence, peerage, president, prime minister, Reichstag participants (1792), Secretary of State. 

Liberal Party of Australia<====>18453<====>Liberal Party of AustraliaThe Liberal Party of Australia is a major centre-right political party in Australia, one of the two major parties in Australian politics, along with the centre-left Australian Labor Party (ALP).  It was founded in 1945 to replace the United Australia Party (UAP).  The Liberal Party is the largest and dominant party in the Coalition with the National Party of Australia.  In two areas the parties have merged, forming the Country Liberal Party of the Northern Territory and the Liberal National Party of Queensland.  Except for a few short periods, the Liberal Party and its predecessors have operated in similar coalitions since the 1920s. 

Lindisfarne<====>18454<====>LindisfarneThe Holy Island of Lindisfarne, also known simply as Holy Island,  is a tidal island off the northeast coast of England, which constitutes the civil parish of Holy Island in Northumberland.    Holy Island has a recorded history from the 6th century AD; it was an important centre of Celtic Christianity under Saints Aidan of Lindisfarne, Cuthbert, Eadfrith of Lindisfarne and Eadberht of Lindisfarne.  After the Viking invasions and the Norman conquest of England, a priory was reestablished.  A small castle was built on the island in 1550. ToponymyThe island of Lindisfarne appears under the Old Welsh name Medcaut in the 9th century Historia Brittonum. 

Literacy<====>18456<====>Literacy  Literacy is traditionally meant as the ability to read and write .   The modern term's meaning has been expanded to include the ability to use language, numbers, images, computers, and other basic means to understand, communicate, gain useful knowledge, solve mathematical problems and use the dominant symbol systems of a culture.The concept of literacy is expanding in OECD countries to include skills to access knowledge through technology and ability to assess complex contexts.   A person who travels and resides in a foreign country but is unable to read or write in the language of the host country would also be regarded by the locals as being illiterate. 

Local-loop unbundling<====>18457<====>Local-loop unbundling Local loop unbundling (LLU or LLUB) is the regulatory process of allowing multiple telecommunications operators to use connections from the telephone exchange to the customer's premises.  The physical wire connection between the local exchange and the customer is known as a "local loop", and is owned by the incumbent local exchange carrier (also referred to as the "ILEC", "local exchange", or in the United States either a "Baby Bell" or an independent telephone company).  To increase competition, other providers are granted unbundled access. Policy background LLU is generally opposed by the ILECs, which in most cases are either former investor-owned (North America) or state-owned monopoly enterprises forced to open themselves to competition.

Lysithea (moon)<====>18460<====>Lysithea (moon)  Lysithea (   ,    ;  ) is a prograde irregular satellite of Jupiter.  It was discovered by Seth Barnes Nicholson in 1938 at Mount Wilson Observatory  and is named after the mythological Lysithea, daughter of Oceanus and one of Zeus' lovers.    Lysithea did not receive its present name until 1975; before then, it was simply known as  .  It was sometimes called "Demeter"    from 1955 to 1975. It belongs to the Himalia group, five moons orbiting between 11 and 13 Gm from Jupiter at an inclination of about 28. 

Leda and the Swan<====>18461<====>Leda and the Swan  Leda and the Swan is a story and subject in art from Greek mythology in which the god Zeus, in the form of a swan, seduces Leda.  According to later Greek mythology, Leda bore Helen and Polydeuces, children of Zeus, while at the same time bearing Castor and Clytemnestra, children of her husband Tyndareus, the King of Sparta.  In the W.  B.  Yeats version, it is subtly suggested that Clytemnestra, although being the daughter of Tyndareus, has somehow been traumatized by what the swan has done to her mother (see below). 

Lions Clubs International<====>18463<====>Lions Clubs International  Lions Clubs International (LCI) is an international secular, non-political service organization established originally in 1916 in Evansville, Indiana by Dr.  William Perry Woods., it had over 46,000 local clubs and more than 1. 4 million members in over 200 countries around the world.  Headquartered in Oak Brook, Illinois, United States, the organization aims to meet the needs of communities on a local and global scale.

Laches (equity)<====>18465<====>Laches (equity)  Laches ( ,  , like "latches";  ,  ;  Law French: "remissness", "dilatoriness", from Old French laschesse) refers to a lack of diligence and activity in making a legal claim, or moving forward with legal enforcement of a right, particularly in regards to equity; hence, it is an unreasonable delay that can be viewed as prejudicing the opposing [defending] party.  When asserted in litigation, it is an equity defense, that is, a defense to a claim for an equitable remedy.  The person invoking laches is asserting that an opposing party has "slept on its rights", and that, as a result of this delay, circumstances have changed, witnesses or evidence may have been lost or no longer available, etc. 

Lyman Abbott<====>18470<====>Lyman Abbott  Lyman Abbott (December 18, 1835 – October 22, 1922)  was an American Congregationalist theologian, editor, and author.BiographyEarly yearsLyman Abbott was born at Roxbury, Massachusetts on December 18, 1835, the son of the prolific author, educator and historian Jacob Abbott.   Lyman Abbott grew up in Farmington, Maine and later in New York City.    Abbott's ancestors were from England, and came to America roughly twenty years after Plymouth Rock.  He graduated from the New York University in 1853, where he was a member of the Eucleian Society, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1856. 

Leap second<====>18472<====>Leap second A leap second is a one-second adjustment that is occasionally applied to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) in order to keep its time of day close to the mean solar time, or UT1.  Without such a correction, time reckoned by Earth's rotation drifts away from atomic time because of irregularities in the Earth's rate of rotation.  Since this system of correction was implemented in 1972, 27 leap seconds have been inserted, the most recent on December 31, 2016 at 23:59:60 UTC.    The UTC time standard, which is widely used for international timekeeping and as the reference for civil time in most countries, uses the international system (SI) definition of the second, based on atomic clocks. 

Luca Pacioli<====>18473<====>Luca Pacioli  Fra Luca Bartolomeo de Pacioli (sometimes Paccioli or Paciolo;   1447–1517) was an Italian mathematician, Franciscan friar, collaborator with Leonardo da Vinci, and a seminal contributor to the field now known as accounting.  He is referred to as "The Father of Accounting and Bookkeeping" in Europe and he was the first person to publish a work on the double-entry system of book-keeping in that continent.He was also called Luca di Borgo after his birthplace, Borgo Sansepolcro, Tuscany. LifeLuca Pacioli was born between 1446 and 1448 in Sansepolcro (Tuscany) where he received an abbaco education. 

Lower Mainland<====>18474<====>Lower Mainland  {{Infobox settlement   }}The Lower Mainland is a name commonly applied to the region surrounding and including Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  As of 2016, 2,832,000 people (60% of British Columbia's total population), lived in the region; sixteen of the province's thirty most populous municipalities are located there.  Canada 2016 Census Canada 2016 Census.  Retrieved on: 2017-02-10.   Islands contained within rivers in the region are considered to be part of the Lower Mainland. While the term Lower Mainland has been recorded from the earliest period of non-native settlement in British Columbia, it has never been officially defined in legal terms. 

Lucius Afranius (poet)<====>18475<====>Lucius Afranius (poet) Lucius Afranius was an ancient Roman comic poet, who lived at the beginning of the 1st century BC.    LifeAfranius' comedies described Roman scenes and manners (the genre called comoediae togatae) and the subjects were mostly taken from the life of the lower classes (comoediae tabernariae). They were considered by some ancients to be frequently polluted with disgraceful amours, which, according to Quintilian, were only a representation of the conduct of Afranius.    He depicted, however, Roman life with such accuracy that he is classed with Menander, from whom indeed he borrowed largely. 

London Post Office Railway<====>18476<====>London Post Office Railway The Post Office Railway, known as Mail Rail since 1987, is a   narrow gauge, driverless underground railway in London that was built by the Post Office with assistance from the Underground Electric Railways Company of London, to move mail between sorting offices.  Inspired by the Chicago Tunnel Company,  it operated from 1927 until 2003. A museum within the former railway was opened in September 2017. GeographyThe line ran from Paddington Head District Sorting Office in the west to the Eastern Head District Sorting Office at Whitechapel in the east, a distance of  . 

Lulach<====>18477<====>Lulach  Lulach mac Gille Coemgáin (Modern Gaelic: Lughlagh mac Gille Chomghain,  known in English simply as Lulach, and nicknamed Tairbith, "the Unfortunate"  and Fatuus, "the Simple-minded" or "the Foolish";  before 1033 – 17 March 1058) was King of Scots between 15 August 1057 and 17 March 1058. Lulach was the son of Gruoch of Scotland, from her first marriage to Gille Coemgáin, Mormaer of Moray, and thus the stepson of Macbeth (Mac Bethad mac Findlaích).  Following the death at the Battle of Lumphanan of Macbeth on 15 August 1057, the king's followers placed Lulach on the throne. 

Lexicography<====>18483<====>Lexicography    Lexicography is divided into two separate but equally important groups:Practical lexicography is the art or craft of compiling, writing and editing dictionaries. Theoretical lexicography is the scholarly discipline of analyzing and describing the semantic, syntagmatic and paradigmatic relationships within the lexicon (vocabulary) of a language, developing theories of dictionary components and structures linking the data in dictionaries, the needs for information by users in specific types of situations, and how users may best access the data incorporated in printed and electronic dictionaries.  This is sometimes referred to as 'metalexicography'. There is some disagreement on the definition of lexicology, as distinct from lexicography. 

Law enforcement<====>18486<====>Law enforcementLaw enforcement is any system by which some members of society act in an organized manner to enforce the law by discovering, deterring, rehabilitating, or punishing people who violate the rules and norms governing that society.   Although the term may encompass entities such as courts and prisons, it is most frequently applied to those who directly engage in patrols or surveillance to dissuade and discover criminal activity, and those who investigate crimes and apprehend offenders, Kären M.  Hess, Christine Hess Orthmann, Introduction to Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice (2008), p.  1.   a task typically carried out by the police or another law enforcement agency. 

Libido<====>18488<====>Libido   Libido ( ), colloquially known as sex drive, is a person's overall sexual drive or desire for sexual activity.  Sex drive is influenced by biological, psychological and social factors.  Biologically, the sex hormones and associated neurotransmitters that act upon the nucleus accumbens (primarily testosterone and dopamine, respectively) regulate libido in humans.   Social factors, such as work and family, and internal psychological factors, such as personality and stress, can affect libido.  Sex drive can also be affected by medical conditions, medications, lifestyle and relationship issues, and age (e. g. , puberty).  A person who has extremely frequent or a suddenly increased sex drive may be experiencing hypersexuality, while the opposite condition is hyposexuality. 

Larissa<====>18490<====>Larissa   Larissa (   ) is the capital and largest city of the Thessaly region, the fifth-most populous in Greece and capital of the Larissa regional unit.  It is a principal agricultural centre and a national transport hub, linked by road and rail with the port of Volos, the cities of Thessaloniki and Athens.  Larissa, within its municipality, has 162,591 inhabitants, while the regional unit of Larissa reached a population of 284,325 (in 2011).    The urban area of the city, although mostly contained within the Larissa municipality, also includes the communities of Giannouli, Platykampos, Nikaia, Terpsithea and several other suburban settlements, bringing the wider urban area population of the city to about 174,012 inhabitants and extends over an area of  . 

Lead and follow<====>18491<====>Lead and follow In some types of partner dance, lead and follow are designations for the two dancers comprising a dance couple.  In the case of mixed-sex couples, the male is traditionally the Lead and the female is the Follow.  The Lead is responsible for guiding the couple and initiating transitions to different dance steps and, in improvised dances, for choosing the dance steps to perform.  The Lead communicates choices to the Follow and directs the Follow by means of subtle physical and visual signals, thereby allowing the couple to be smoothly coordinated.  TheoryThe amount of direction given by the Lead depends on several factors, including dance style, social context of the dance, and experience and personalities of the dancers. 

Lexeme<====>18492<====>Lexeme A lexeme ( ) is a unit of lexical meaning that exists regardless of the number of inflectional endings it may have or the number of words it may contain.  It is a basic unit of meaning, and the headwords of a dictionary are all lexemes.   Put more technically, a lexeme is an abstract unit of morphological analysis in linguistics, that roughly corresponds to a set of forms taken by a single word.   For example, in the terminology language, run, runs, ran and running are forms of the same lexeme, conventionally written as  RUN . 

Lord's Prayer<====>18494<====>Lord's Prayer The Lord's Prayer (also called the Our Father or Pater Noster, among other names) is a venerated Christian prayer that, according to the New Testament, Jesus taught as the way to pray.   Two versions of this prayer are recorded: the long form in the Gospel of Matthew in the middle of the Sermon on the Mount, and the short form in the Gospel of Luke when "one of his disciples said to him, 'Lord, teach us to pray, as John  [ the Baptist ]  taught his disciples.

Lightworks was an early developer of computer-based non-linear editing systems, and has been in development since 1989. The program is currently available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS.  The development of an open source version, as well as ports to Linux and Mac OS X were announced in May 2010.   No source code has yet been released, but the project roadmap has indicated that source code release will happen eventually. 

Love Parade<====>18496<====>Love Parade   The Love Parade ( ) was a popular electronic dance music festival and technoparade that originated in 1989 in West Berlin, Germany.   It was held annually in Berlin from 1989 to 2003 and in 2006, then from 2007 to 2010 in the Ruhr region.  Events scheduled for 2004 and 2005 in Berlin and for 2009 in Bochum  were cancelled. On 24 July 2010, a crowd crush at the Love Parade caused the death of 21 people, with at least 500 others injured.   As a consequence, the organizer of the festival announced that no further Love Parades would be held and that the festival was permanently cancelled. 

Lost Generation<====>18497<====>Lost Generation   The Lost Generation was the generation that came of age during World War I.  Demographers William Strauss and Neil Howe outlined their Strauss–Howe generational theory using 1883–1900 as birth years for this generation.  The term was coined by Gertrude Stein and popularized by Ernest Hemingway, who used it as one of two contrasting epigraphs for his novel The Sun Also Rises.  Hemingway credits the phrase to Gertrude Stein, who was then his mentor and patron. In literature In A Moveable Feast, published after Hemingway's and Stein's deaths, Hemingway claims that Stein heard the phrase from a garage owner who serviced Stein's car. 

Left-wing politics<====>18499<====>Left-wing politicsLeft-wing politics supports social equality and egalitarianism, often in opposition to social hierarchy and social inequality. It typically involves a concern for those in society whom its adherents perceive as disadvantaged relative to others (prioritarianism), as well as a belief that there are unjustified inequalities that need to be reduced or abolished (by advocating for social justice).   The term left-wing can also refer to "the radical, reforming, or socialist section of a political party or system".  The political terms "Left" and "Right" were coined during the French Revolution (1789–1799), referring to the seating arrangement in the Estates General: those who sat on the left generally opposed the monarchy and supported the revolution, including the creation of a republic and secularization,  while those on the right were supportive of the traditional institutions of the Old Regime. 

Los Angeles-class submarine<====>18504<====>Los Angeles-class submarine }   The Los Angeles class is a class of nuclear-powered fast attack submarines (SSN) in service with the United States Navy.  The submarines are also known as the 688 class, after the hull number of lead vessel  .  They represent two generations and close to half a century of the U. S.  Navy's attack submarine fleet.  As of 2017, 36 of the class are still in commission and 26 retired from service, with two being converted to moored training ships.  Of the 26 retired boats, 14 of them were laid up half way (approximately 17–18 years) through their projected lifespans due to their midlife reactor refuelings being cancelled, and one due to a fire. 

Lucretia<====>18507<====>Lucretia Lucretia ( ) or Lucrece ( ; died  ) was an ancient Roman woman who played a vital role in the transition of Roman government from the Roman Kingdom to the Roman Republic.  While there were no contemporary sources, accounts from Roman historian Livy (Livius) and Greek-Roman historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus from the time of Emperor Caesar Augustus (23 September 63 BC – 19 August 14 AD) agreed that there was such a woman and that her suicide after being raped by an Etruscan king's son was the immediate cause of the anti-monarchist rebellion that overthrew the monarchy. 

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol<====>18508<====>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol  (LDAP;  ) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.    Directory services play an important role in developing intranet and Internet applications by allowing the sharing of information about users, systems, networks, services, and applications throughout the network.    As examples, directory services may provide any organized set of records, often with a hierarchical structure, such as a corporate email directory.   Similarly, a telephone directory is a list of subscribers with an address and a phone number. 

Latino<====>18522<====>Latino  Latino (  or  )  is a term often used in the United States to refer to people with cultural ties to Latin America, in contrast to Hispanic which is a demonym that includes Spaniards and other speakers of the Spanish language."Latino" as a category used in the United States may be understood as a shorthand for the Spanish word latinoamericano (Latin American in English) or the Portuguese phrase latino americano, thus excluding speakers of Spanish or Portuguese from Europe. Both Hispanic and Latino are generally used to denote people living in the United States,   so much so that "Outside the United States, we don't speak of Latinos; we speak of Mexicans, Colombians, Peruvians, and so forth. 

Latin America<====>18524<====>Latin America  Latin America  is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Spanish, French and Portuguese are predominant including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Saint Barthelemy and Venezuela.  The term originated in 19th century France as Amérique latine to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed.  It is therefore broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic America—though it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana. 

Lynx (web browser)<====>18529<====>Lynx (web browser)  Lynx is a customizable text-based web browser for use on cursor-addressable character cell terminals., it is the oldest web browser still in general use and active development,  having started in 1992. HistoryLynx was a product of the Distributed Computing Group within Academic Computing Services of the University of Kansas,   and was initially developed in 1992 by a team of students and staff at the university (Lou Montulli, Michael Grobe and Charles Rezac) as a hypertext browser used solely to distribute campus information as part of a Campus-Wide Information Server and for browsing the Gopher space. 

Lynx (programming language)<====>18530<====>Lynx (programming language)Lynx is a programming language for large distributed networks, using remote procedure calls. It was developed by the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1984 for the Charlotte multicomputer operating system. In 1986 at the University of Rochester Lynx was ported to the Chrysalis operating system running on a BBN Butterfly multiprocessor.BibliographyM. L.

L'Hôpital's rule<====>18531<====>L'Hôpital's rule In mathematics, and more specifically in calculus, L'Hôpital's rule or L'Hospital's rule ( ) uses derivatives to help evaluate limits involving indeterminate forms.   Application (or repeated application) of the rule often converts an indeterminate form to an expression that can be evaluated by substitution, allowing easier evaluation of the limit.  The rule is named after the 17th-century French mathematician Guillaume de l'Hôpital.  Although the contribution of the rule is often attributed to L'Hôpital, the theorem was first introduced to L'Hôpital in 1694 by the Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli. L'Hôpital's rule states that for functions   and   which are differentiable on an open interval   except possibly at a point   contained in  , if    The differentiation of the numerator and denominator often simplifies the quotient or converts it to a limit that can be evaluated directly. 

Lexicology<====>18532<====>Lexicology  Lexicology is the part of linguistics which studies words.  This may include their nature and function as symbols,  their meaning, the relationship of their meaning to epistemology in general, and the rules of their composition from smaller elements (morphemes such as the English -ed marker for past or un- for negation; and phonemes as basic sound units). Lexicology also involves relations between words, which may involve semantics (for example, love vs.  affection), derivation (for example, fathom vs.  unfathomably), use and sociolinguistic distinctions (for example, flesh vs.  meat), and any other issues involved in analyzing the whole lexicon of a language. 

Lake Abitibi<====>18534<====>Lake Abitibi Lake Abitibi ( ) is a lake in northeastern Ontario and western Quebec, Canada.   The lake, which lies within the vast Clay Belt, is separated in two distinct portions by a short narrows, making it actually 2 lakes.  Its total area is 931 km², and net area 903 km².   The lake is shallow and studded with islands.   Its shores and vicinity are covered with small timber. Its outlet is the Abitibi River, a tributary the Moose River, which empties into James Bay.   The lake takes its name from the river.   "Abitibi" comes from the Algonquin words abitah, meaning middle and nipi meaning water,  possibly a reference to its geographic location between the Harricana (from the Algonquin word Nanikana, meaning "the main way")  to the east and the Kapuskasing–Mattagami river system to the west. 

Lansing, Michigan<====>18538<====>Lansing, Michigan  Lansing   is the capital of the U. S.  state of Michigan.  It is mostly in Ingham County, although portions of the city extend west into Eaton County and north into Clinton County.  The 2010 Census placed the city's population at 114,297,  making it the fifth largest city in Michigan.  The population of its Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) was 464,036, while the even larger Combined Statistical Area (CSA) population, which includes Shiawassee County, was 534,684.  It was named the new state capital of Michigan in 1847, ten years after Michigan became a state. 

Leukemia<====>18539<====>Leukemia    Leukemia, also spelled leukaemia, is a group of cancers that usually begin in the bone marrow and result in high numbers of abnormal white blood cells.   These white blood cells are not fully developed and are called blasts or leukemia cells.Symptoms may include bleeding and bruising problems, feeling tired, fever, and an increased risk of infections.   These symptoms occur due to a lack of normal blood cells.   Diagnosis is typically made by blood tests or bone marrow biopsy.   The exact cause of leukemia is unknown. 

Length<====>18542<====>Length  In geometric measurements, length is the most extended dimension of an object.   In the International System of Quantities, length is any quantity with dimension distance.  In other contexts, length is a measured dimension of an object.  For example, it is possible to cut a length of wire shorter than the wire's width. Length may be distinguished from height, which is vertical extent, and width or breadth, which are the distance from side to side, measuring across the object at right angles to the length.  Length is a measure of one dimension, whereas area is a measure of two dimensions (length squared) and volume is a measure of three dimensions (length cubed). 

Louis Ginzberg<====>18543<====>Louis Ginzberg   Rabbi Louis Ginzberg ( , Levy Gintzburg, November 28, 1873 – November 11, 1953) was a Talmudist and leading figure in the Conservative Movement of Judaism of the twentieth century.  He was born on November 28, 1873, in Kaunas, Vilna Governorate (then called Kovno); he died on November 11, 1953, in New York City. Biographical backgroundGinzberg was born into a religious family whose piety and erudition was well known.  The family traced its lineage back to the revered talmudist, halachist, and kabbalist Gaon of Vilna.  Ginzberg emulated the Vilna Gaon’s intermingling of ‘academic knowledge’ in Torah studies under the label ‘historical Judaism’. 

Left-arm unorthodox spin<====>18544<====>Left-arm unorthodox spin Left-arm unorthodox spin, also known as slow left arm chinaman, is a type of left arm wrist off spin bowling in the sport of cricket.  Left-arm unorthodox spin bowlers use wrist spin to spin the ball, and make it deviate, or "turn" from left to right after pitching.   The direction of turn is the same as that of a traditional right-handed off spin bowler; however, the ball will usually turn more sharply due to the spin being imparted predominantly by the wrist. Some left-arm unorthodox bowlers also bowl the equivalent of a "googly", (or "wrong'un"), which turns from right to left on the pitch.

Louis IX of France<====>18549<====>Louis IX of France   Louis IX (25 April 1214 – 25 August 1270), commonly known as Saint Louis, was King of France and a canonized saint.  Louis was crowned in Reims at the age of 12, following the death of his father Louis VIII the Lion, although his mother, Blanche of Castile, ruled the kingdom until he reached maturity.  During Louis's childhood, Blanche dealt with the opposition of rebellious vassals and put an end to the Albigensian crusade which had started 20 years earlier. As an adult, Louis IX faced recurring conflicts with some of the most powerful nobles, such as Hugh X of Lusignan and Peter of Dreux. 

Linear B<====>18551<====>Linear B Linear B is a syllabic script that was used for writing Mycenaean Greek, the earliest attested form of Greek.  The script predates the Greek alphabet by several centuries.  The oldest Mycenaean writing dates to about 1450 BC.   It is descended from the older Linear A, an undeciphered earlier script used for writing the Minoan language, as is the later Cypriot syllabary, which also recorded Greek.  Linear B, found mainly in the palace archives at Knossos, Cydonia,  Pylos, Thebes and Mycenae,  disappeared with the fall of Mycenaean civilization during the Late Bronze Age collapse. 

Larousse Gastronomique<====>18552<====>Larousse Gastronomique  Larousse Gastronomique ( ) is an encyclopedia of gastronomy.  The majority of the book is about French cuisine, and contains recipes for French dishes and cooking techniques.  The first edition included few non-French dishes and ingredients; later editions include many more.  The book was originally published by Éditions Larousse, founded by Pierre Larousse. BackgroundThe first edition (1938) was edited by Prosper Montagné, with prefaces by Georges Auguste Escoffier and Philéas Gilbert.  Gilbert was a collaborator in the creation of this book as well as Le Guide Culinaire with Escoffier, leading to some cross-over with the two books. 

Louis XIV of France<====>18553<====>Louis XIV of France Louis XIV (5 September 1638 1 September 1715), known as Louis the Great ( ) or the Sun King ( ), was a monarch of the House of Bourbon who reigned as King of France from 1643 until his death in 1715.  Starting at the age of 5, his reign of 72 years and 110 days is the longest recorded of any monarch of a sovereign country in European history.    In the age of absolutism in Europe, Louis XIV's France was a leader in the growing centralization of power. 

Ludwig Ritter von Köchel<====>18554<====>Ludwig Ritter von Köchel  Ludwig Alois Friedrich Ritter von Köchel ( ; 14 January 1800 – 3 June 1877) was an Austrian musicologist, writer, composer, botanist and publisher.  He is best known for cataloguing the works of Mozart and originating the 'K-numbers' by which they are known (K for Köchel). LifeBorn in the town of Stein, Lower Austria, he studied law in Vienna and graduated with a PhD in 1827.  For fifteen years, he was tutor to the four sons of Archduke Charles of Austria.  Köchel was rewarded with a knighthood and a generous financial settlement, permitting him to spend the rest of his life as a private scholar. 

LEO (computer)<====>18555<====>LEO (computer)The LEO I (Lyons Electronic Office I) was the first computer used for commercial business applications. The prototype LEO I was modelled closely on the Cambridge EDSAC.  Its construction was overseen by Oliver Standingford, Raymond Thompson and David Caminer of J.  Lyons and Co. .  LEO I ran its first business application in 1951.  In 1954 Lyons formed LEO Computers Ltd to market LEO I and its successors LEO II and LEO III to other companies.  LEO Computers eventually became part of English Electric Company (EELM) and then International Computers Limited (ICL) and ultimately Fujitsu. 

Laurence of Canterbury<====>18557<====>Laurence of Canterbury  Laurence  (died 2 February 619) was the second Archbishop of Canterbury from about 604 to 619.  He was a member of the Gregorian mission sent from Italy to England to Christianise the Anglo-Saxons from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism, although the date of his arrival is disputed.  He was consecrated archbishop by his predecessor, Augustine of Canterbury, during Augustine's lifetime, to ensure continuity in the office.  While archbishop, he attempted unsuccessfully to resolve differences with the native British bishops by corresponding with them about points of dispute.  Laurence faced a crisis following the death of King Æthelberht of Kent, when the king's successor abandoned Christianity; he eventually reconverted. 

Leaf by Niggle<====>18560<====>Leaf by Niggle    "Leaf by Niggle" is a short story written by J.  R.  R.  Tolkien in 1938–39  and first published in the Dublin Review in January 1945.  It can be found, most notably, in Tolkien's book titled Tree and Leaf, and in other places (including the collections The Tolkien Reader, Poems & Stories, A Tolkien Miscellany, and Tales from the Perilous Realm).  This is notable because the book, consisting of a seminal essay called "On Fairy-Stories" and "Leaf by Niggle", offers the underlying philosophy (Creation and Sub-Creation, see below) of much of Tolkien's fantastical writings. 

Leet<====>18562<====>Leet  Leet (or "1337"), also known as eleet or leetspeak, is a system of modified spellings and verbiage used primarily on the Internet for many  phonetic languages.  It uses some alphabetic characters to replace others in ways that play on the similarity of their glyphs via reflection or other resemblance.  Additionally, it modifies certain words based on a system of suffixes and alternative meanings. The term "leet" is derived from the word elite.  The leet lexicon involves a specialized form of symbolic writing.  For example, leet spellings of the word leet include 1337 and l33t; eleet may be spelled 31337 or 3l33t.

Lois Lane<====>18564<====>Lois Lane   Lois Lane is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.  Created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, she first appeared in Action Comics #1 (June 1938).  Lois is an award-winning reporter for the Metropolis newspaper, the Daily Planet, and the primary love interest of the superhero Superman. Her physical appearance was originally based on Joanne Carter, a model hired by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, and Siegel's future wife.  For her character, Siegel was inspired by actress Glenda Farrell, the movie star who portrayed Torchy Blane—a gutsy, beautiful headline-hunting reporter, starring in a series of 1930s films. 

Linker (computing)<====>18566<====>Linker (computing)  In computing, a linker or link editor is a computer program that takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combines them into a single executable file, library file, or another 'object' file. A simpler version that writes its output directly to memory is called the loader, though loading is typically considered a separate process.  OverviewComputer programs typically are composed of several parts or modules; these parts/modules need not all be contained within a single object file, and in such cases refer to each other by means of symbols.   Typically, an object file can contain three kinds of symbols:defined "external" symbols, sometimes called "public" or "entry" symbols, which allow it to be called by other modules,undefined "external" symbols, which reference other modules where these symbols are defined, andlocal symbols, used internally within the object file to facilitate relocation. 

Legendre symbol<====>18567<====>Legendre symbolLegendre symbol ( ) for various a (along top) and p (along left side).    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 3 0 1  −15 0 1  −1  −1 1   7 0 1 1  −1 1  −1  −1 11  0  1  −1 1  1 1  −1  −1  −1  1  −1 Only 0 ≤ a  \left(\frac{a}{p}\right) = \begin{cases}1 & \text{ if } a \text{ is a quadratic residue modulo } p \text{ and } a \not\equiv 0\pmod{p}, \\1 & \text{ if } a \text{ is a quadratic non-residue modulo } p, \\0 & \text{ if } a \equiv 0 \pmod{p}.  \end{cases} Legendre's original definition was by means of the explicit formula  \left(\frac{a}{p}\right) \equiv a^{\frac{p-1}{2}} \pmod{p} \quad \text{ and } \quad\left(\frac{a}{p}\right) \in \{-1,0,1\}.  By Euler's criterion, which had been discovered earlier and was known to Legendre, these two definitions are equivalent.  Thus Legendre's contribution lay in introducing a convenient notation that recorded quadratic residuosity of a mod p. For the sake of comparison, Gauss used the notation aRp, aNp according to whether a is a residue or a non-residue modulo p. It turns out that Legendre's definition can be generalized even further by using the domain of definition  \mathbb{F}_q^* . This definition fits succinctly as a short exact sequence of abelian groups 0 \to (\mathbb{F}_q^*)^2 \to \mathbb{F}_q \to \{ \pm 1 \} \to 0 For typographical convenience, the Legendre symbol is sometimes written as (a|p) or (a/p). The sequence (a|p) for a equal to 0, 1, 2,... is periodic with period p and is sometimes called the Legendre sequence, with {0,1,−1} values occasionally replaced by {1,0,1} or {0,1,0}.    In the following table, the variables a and p have been renamed k and n, respectively; and each row n can be seen to exhibit periodicity just described.Table of valuesThe following is a table of values of Legendre symbol ( ) with n ≤ 127, k ≤ 30, n odd prime.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 3  1 −1 0  1 −1 0 1 −1  0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0  1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0  1 −1 0 1 −1 0 5 1 −1 −1 1 0 1 −1 −1 1 0 1 −1 −1 1 0 1 −1 −1 1 0 1 −1 −1 1 0 1 −1 −1 1 0 7 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 0 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 0 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 0 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 0 1 1 11 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 0 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 0 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 13 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 1 0 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 1 0 1 −1 1 1 17 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 1 0 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 19 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 0 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 23 1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 0 1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 29 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 −1 1 0 1 31 1 1 −1 1 1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 37 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 1 41 1 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 43 1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 −1 1 1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 47 1 1 1 1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 53 1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 59 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 1 1 −1 61 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 1 1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 67 1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 1 1 1 1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 71 1 1 1 1 1 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 1 73 1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 79 1 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 1 1 1 1 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 83 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 1 1 1 1 1 1 89 1 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 97 1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 101 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 1 1 −1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 1 103 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 1 −1 1 1 1 107 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 1 1 109 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 1 1 −1 113 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 127 1 1 −1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 −1 1 1 1 1 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 1 Properties of the Legendre symbolThere are a number of useful properties of the Legendre symbol which, together with the law of quadratic reciprocity, can be used to compute it efficiently.The Legendre symbol is periodic in its first (or top) argument: if a ≡ b (mod p), then   \left(\frac{a}{p}\right) = \left(\frac{b}{p}\right). The Legendre symbol is a completely multiplicative function of its top argument: \left(\frac{ab}{p}\right) = \left(\frac{a}{p}\right)\left(\frac{b}{p}\right).  In particular, the product of two numbers that are both quadratic residues or quadratic non-residues modulo p is a residue, whereas the product of a residue with a non-residue is a non-residue. A special case is the Legendre symbol of a square: \left(\frac{x^2}{p}\right) = \begin{cases} 1 & \mbox{if }p\nmid x\\ 0 & \mbox{if }p\mid x. \end{cases} When viewed as a function of a, the Legendre symbol ( ) is the unique quadratic (or order 2) Dirichlet character modulo p.The first supplement to the law of quadratic reciprocity: \left(\frac{-1}{p}\right)  = (-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}} = \begin{cases}    1 & \mbox{ if }p \equiv 1\pmod{4} \\   -1 & \mbox{ if }p \equiv 3\pmod{4}.   \end{cases} The second supplement to the law of quadratic reciprocity:  \left(\frac{2}{p}\right) = (-1)^\tfrac{p^2-1}{8} = \begin{cases}    1 & \mbox{ if }p \equiv 1\mbox{ or }7 \pmod{8} \\   -1 & \mbox{ if }p \equiv 3\mbox{ or }5 \pmod{8}. \end{cases} Special formulas for the Legendre symbol ( ) for small values of a:For an odd prime p ≠ 3,    \left(\frac{3}{p}\right) = (-1)^{\big\lfloor \frac{p+1}{6}\big\rfloor} = \begin{cases}    1 & \mbox{ if }p \equiv 1\mbox{ or }11 \pmod{12} \\   -1 & \mbox{ if }p \equiv 5\mbox{ or }7 \pmod{12}. \end{cases} For an odd prime p ≠ 5,    \left(\frac{5}{p}\right) =(-1)^{\big\lfloor \frac{2p+2}{5}\big \rfloor} = \begin{cases}    1 & \mbox{ if }p \equiv 1\mbox{ or }4 \pmod5 \\   -1 & \mbox{ if }p \equiv 2\mbox{ or }3 \pmod5. \end{cases} The Fibonacci numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, … are defined by the recurrenceIf p is a prime number then  F_{p-\left(\frac{p}{5}\right)} \equiv 0 \pmod p, \qquad F_{p} \equiv \left(\frac{p}{5}\right) \pmod p.   For example,  \begin{align}   \left(\tfrac{2}{5}\right)  &= -1, &    F_3 &= 2,  &    F_2 &= 1,  \\    \left(\tfrac{3}{5}\right)  &= -1, &    F_4 &= 3,  &    F_3 &= 2,  \\    \left(\tfrac{5}{5}\right)  &=  0, &    F_5 &= 5,  &   & \\    \left(\tfrac{7}{5}\right)  &= -1, &    F_8 &= 21, &    F_7 &= 13, \\    \left(\tfrac{11}{5}\right) &=  1, & F_{10} &= 55, & F_{11} &= 89. \end{align}  This result comes from the theory of Lucas sequences, which are used in primality testing.  See Wall–Sun–Sun prime.Legendre symbol and quadratic reciprocityLet p and q be distinct odd primes. Using the Legendre symbol, the quadratic reciprocity law can be stated concisely: \left(\frac{q}{p}\right)\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) = (-1)^{\tfrac{p-1}{2}\cdot\tfrac{q-1}{2}}. Many proofs of quadratic reciprocity are based on Legendre's formula \left(\frac{a}{p}\right) \equiv a^{\tfrac{p-1}{2}} \pmod p. In addition, several alternative expressions for the Legendre symbol were devised in order to produce various proofs of the quadratic reciprocity law.Gauss introduced the quadratic Gauss sum and used the formula \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\zeta^{ak^2}=\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\zeta^{k^2},\qquad \zeta = e^{\frac{2\pi i}{p}} in his fourth  and sixth  proofs of quadratic reciprocity.Kronecker's proof   first establishes that \left(\frac{p}{q}\right) =\sgn\left(\prod_{i=1}^{\frac{q-1}{2}}\prod_{k=1}^{\frac{p-1}{2}}\left(\frac{k}{p}-\frac{i}{q}\right)\right). Reversing the roles of p and q, he obtains the relation between ( ) and ( ).One of Eisenstein's proofs  begins by showing that \left(\frac{q}{p}\right) =\prod_{n=1}^{\frac{p-1}{2}} \frac{\sin\left(\frac{2\pi qn}{p}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{2\pi n}{p}\right)}. Using certain elliptic functions instead of the sine function, Eisenstein was able to prove cubic and quartic reciprocity as well.Related functionsThe Jacobi symbol ( ) is a generalization of the Legendre symbol that allows for a composite second (bottom) argument n, although n must still be odd and positive.  This generalization provides an efficient way to compute all Legendre symbols without performing factorization along the way.A further extension is the Kronecker symbol, in which the bottom argument may be any integer.The power residue symbol ( )  generalizes the Legendre symbol to higher power n. The Legendre symbol represents the power residue symbol for n = 2.Computational exampleThe above properties, including the law of quadratic reciprocity, can be used to evaluate any Legendre symbol. For example: \begin{align}\left ( \frac{12345}{331}\right )&=\left ( \frac{3}{331}\right ) \left ( \frac{5}{331}\right ) \left ( \frac{823}{331}\right ) \\&= \left ( \frac{3}{331}\right ) \left ( \frac{5}{331}\right ) \left ( \frac{161}{331}\right ) \\&= \left ( \frac{3}{331}\right ) \left ( \frac{5}{331}\right ) \left ( \frac{7}{331}\right ) \left ( \frac{23}{331}\right ) \\&= (-1)\left (\frac{331}{3}\right) \left(\frac{331}{5}\right) (-1) \left(\frac{331}{7}\right) (-1)\left (\frac{331}{23}\right ) \\&= -\left ( \frac{1}{3}\right ) \left ( \frac{1}{5}\right ) \left ( \frac{2}{7}\right ) \left ( \frac{9}{23}\right )\\&= -\left ( \frac{1}{3}\right ) \left ( \frac{1}{5}\right ) \left ( \frac{2}{7}\right ) \left ( \frac{3^2}{23}\right )\\&= -(1) (1) (1) (1) \\&= -1.\end{align} Or using a more efficient computation: \left ( \frac{12345}{331}\right )=\left ( \frac{98}{331}\right )=\left ( \frac{2 \cdot 7^2}{331}\right )=\left ( \frac{2}{331}\right )=(-1)^\tfrac{331^2-1}{8}=-1.

Laconia incident<====>18569<====>Laconia incidentDISPLAYTITLE  The Laconia incident was a series of events surrounding the sinking of a British troopship in the Atlantic Ocean during World War II and an attack on the subsequent rescue attempts.  On 12 September 1942,   carrying some 2,732 crew, passengers, soldiers and prisoners of war (POWs), was torpedoed and sunk by the German U-boat submarine   off the coast of West Africa.  Operating partly under the dictates of the old prize rules, the U-boat commander, Korvettenkapitän Werner Hartenstein, immediately commenced rescue operations.  U-156 broadcast their humanitarian intent on open radio channels to all Allied forces in the area, and were joined by the crews of several other U-boats in the vicinity. 

Léon Theremin<====>18571<====>Léon Theremin Lev Sergeyevich Termen ( ;   – 3 November 1993), or Léon Theremin in the United States, was a Russian and Soviet inventor, most famous for his invention of the theremin, one of the first electronic musical instruments and the first to be mass-produced.  He also devised the interlace technique   pages 41-45  for improving the quality of a video signal, still widely used in video and television technology.  His listening device, "The Thing", hung for seven years in plain view in the United States Ambassador's Moscow office and enabled Soviet agents to eavesdrop on secret conversations. 

Linear prediction<====>18572<====>Linear predictionLinear prediction is a mathematical operation where future values of a discrete-time signal are estimated as a linear function of previous samples. In digital signal processing, linear prediction is often called linear predictive coding (LPC) and can thus be viewed as a subset of filter theory.  In system analysis (a subfield of mathematics), linear prediction can be viewed as a part of mathematical modelling or optimization. The prediction modelThe most common representation is \widehat{x}(n) = \sum_{i=1}^p a_i x(n-i)\, where  \widehat{x}(n)  is the predicted signal value,  x(n-i)  the previous observed values, and  a_i  the predictor coefficients. 

Leto<====>18574<====>Leto  In Greek mythology, Leto ( ;   Lētṓ; Λατώ, Lātṓ in Dorian Greek, etymology and meaning disputed) is a daughter of the Titans Coeus and Phoebe, the sister of Asteria,  and the mother, by Zeus, of Apollo and Artemis. The island of Kos is claimed as her birthplace.   In the Olympian scheme, Zeus is the father of her twins,  Apollo and Artemis, the Letoides, which Leto conceived after her hidden beauty accidentally caught the eyes of Zeus.  Classical Greek myths record little about Leto other than her pregnancy and her search for a place where she could give birth to Apollo and Artemis, since Hera in her jealousy had caused all lands to shun her. 

La Malinche<====>18576<====>La Malinche La Malinche ( ; c.  1496 or c.  1501 – c.  1529), known also as Malinalli  , Malintzin   or Doña Marina  , was a Nahua woman from the Mexican Gulf Coast, who played a role in the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, acting as an interpreter, advisor, mistress, and intermediary for the Spanish conquistador, Hernán Cortés.  She was one of 20 women slaves given to the Spaniards by the natives of Tabasco in 1519.   Later, she became a mistress to Cortés and gave birth to his first son, Martín, who is considered one of the first Mestizos (people of mixed European and indigenous American ancestry). 

Lusitania<====>18577<====>Lusitania    Lusitania ( ,  ,  ) or Hispania Lusitana was an ancient Iberian Roman province including approximately all of modern Portugal south of the Douro river and part of modern Spain (the present autonomous community of Extremadura and a small part of the province of Salamanca).  It was named after the Lusitani or Lusitanian people (an Indo-European people).  Its capital was Emerita Augusta (currently Mérida, Spain), and it was initially part of the Roman Republic province of Hispania Ulterior, before becoming a province of its own in the Roman Empire.  Romans first came to the territory around the mid-2nd century BC. 

Limited-stop<====>18578<====>Limited-stop In public transit, a limited-stop bus, tram, or train service is a service that stops less frequently than local service.   The term is normally used on routes with a mixture of fast and slow services, and can differ in meaning, depending on how it is used by different transit agencies.   Additionally, there may be a "semi-fast" service, with more stops than a "fast" service, but fewer than a "slow" service. In a typical metropolitan area, limited-stop services are most likely to be scheduled at times when more people are travelling (these times are not limited to the rush hours).

Ligand<====>18589<====>Ligand   In coordination chemistry, a ligand  is an ion or molecule (functional group) that binds to a central metal atom to form a coordination complex.  The bonding with the metal generally involves formal donation of one or more of the ligand's electron pairs.  The nature of metal–ligand bonding can range from covalent to ionic.  Furthermore, the metal–ligand bond order can range from one to three.  Ligands are viewed as Lewis bases, although rare cases are known to involve Lewis acidic "ligands".   Metals and metalloids are bound to ligands in virtually all circumstances, although gaseous "naked" metal ions can be generated in high vacuum. 

Lincos (artificial language)<====>18591<====>Lincos (artificial language) Lincos (an abbreviation of the Latin phrase lingua cosmica) is a constructed language first described in 1960 by Dr.  Hans Freudenthal in his book Lincos: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse, Part 1.  It is a language designed to be understandable by any possible intelligent extraterrestrial life form, for use in interstellar radio transmissions.  Freudenthal considered that such a language should be easily understood by beings not acquainted with any Earthling syntax or language.  Lincos was designed to be capable of encapsulating "the whole bulk of our knowledge. "Concepts and rangeThe Lincos "dictionary" is intended to be transmitted first before any additional messages. 

Lascaux<====>18594<====>Lascaux  Lascaux ( , "Lascaux Cave";  ,   ) is the setting of a complex of caves near the village of Montignac, in the department of Dordogne in southwestern France.  Over 600 parietal wall paintings decorate the interior walls and ceilings of the cave.  The paintings are primarily of large animals, typical local and contemporary fauna that correspond with the fossil record of the Upper Paleolithic time.  The drawings are the combined effort of many generations, and with continued debate, the paintings are estimated around 17,000 years BP.  Lascaux was inducted into the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list in 1979, as element of the Prehistoric Sites and Decorated Caves of the Vézère Valley. 

Lex Luthor<====>18595<====>Lex Luthor  Alexander Joseph "Lex" Luthor is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, though on occasions he has established himself as an antihero.  He was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.  Lex Luthor first appeared in Action Comics #23 (April 1940) and has since endured as the archenemy of Superman.  Lex Luthor is a wealthy, power-mad American business magnate, ingenious engineer, philanthropist to the city of Metropolis, and one of the most intelligent people in the world.  A charismatic and well-known public figure, he is the owner of a corporation called LexCorp, with Mercy Graves as his personal assistant and bodyguard. 

Lute<====>18596<====>Lute    A lute  ( , or  )  is any plucked string instrument with a neck (either fretted or unfretted) and a deep round back enclosing a hollow cavity, usually with a sound hole or opening in the body.  More specifically, the term "lute" can refer to an instrument from the family of European lutes.  The term also refers generally to any string instrument having the strings running in a plane parallel to the sound table (in the Hornbostel–Sachs system).  The strings are attached to pegs or posts at the end of the neck, which have some type of turning mechanism to enable the player to tighten the tension on the string or loosen the tension before playing (which respectively raise or lower the pitch of a string), so that each string is tuned to a specific pitch (or note). 

Little Boy<====>18597<====>Little Boy   "Little Boy" was the codename for the atomic bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 during World War II by the Boeing B-29 Superfortress Enola Gay, piloted by Colonel Paul W.  Tibbets, Jr. , commander of the 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces.  It was the first atomic bomb to be used in warfare.

Laplace transform<====>18610<====>Laplace transform In mathematics, the Laplace transform is an integral transform named after its discoverer Pierre-Simon Laplace ( ).   It takes a function of a real variable   (often time) to a function of a complex variable   (frequency). The Laplace transform is very similar to the Fourier transform.   While the Fourier transform of a function is a complex function of a real variable (frequency), the Laplace transform of a function is a complex function of a complex variable.   Laplace transforms are usually restricted to functions of   with  . 

Liberal arts college<====>18612<====>Liberal arts collegeA liberal arts college is a college with an emphasis on undergraduate study in the liberal arts and sciences.   A liberal arts college aims to impart a broad general knowledge and develop general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, vocational, or technical curriculum.   Students in a liberal arts college generally major in a particular discipline while receiving exposure to a wide range of academic subjects, including sciences as well as the traditional humanities subjects taught as liberal arts.  Although it draws on European antecedents,  the liberal arts college is strongly associated with American higher education, and most liberal arts colleges around the world draw explicitly on the American model. 

Language acquisition<====>18614<====>Language acquisition    Language acquisition is the process by which humans acquire the capacity to perceive and comprehend language, as well as to produce and use words and sentences to communicate.  Language acquisition is one of the quintessential human traits,    because non-humans do not communicate by using language.   Language acquisition usually refers to first-language acquisition, which studies infants' acquisition of their native language.  This is distinguished from second-language acquisition, which deals with the acquisition (in both children and adults) of additional languages. Linguists who are interested in child language acquisition for many years question how language is acquired, lidz et al. 

Left Behind<====>18615<====>Left Behind  Left Behind is a series of 16 best-selling religious novels by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B.  Jenkins, dealing with Christian dispensationalist End Times: the pretribulation, premillennial, Christian eschatological interpretation of the Biblical apocalypse.

Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome<====>18628<====>Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome  Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness of the limbs.  It is the result of an autoimmune reaction in which antibodies are formed against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, and likely other nerve terminal proteins, in the neuromuscular junction (the connection between nerves and the muscle that they supply).   The prevalence is 3. 4 cases per million.Around 60% of those with LEMS have an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer; it is therefore regarded as a paraneoplastic syndrome (a condition that arises as a result of cancer elsewhere in the body). 

Liqueur<====>18629<====>Liqueur A liqueur  (  or  ) is an alcoholic beverage made from a distilled spirit that has been flavored with fruit, cream, herbs, spices, flowers or nuts and bottled with added sugar or other sweetener (such as high-fructose corn syrup).  Liqueurs are typically quite sweet; they are usually not aged for long after the ingredients are mixed, but may have resting periods during their production to allow flavors to mingle. In the United States and Canada, where spirits are often called "liquor" (pronounced  , with stress on the first rather than the second syllable), there is often confusion over liqueurs and liquors, especially as many spirits today are available in flavored form (e. 

Lilith<====>18630<====>Lilith Lilith ( ;   Lîlîṯ) is a figure in Jewish mythology, developed earliest in the Babylonian Talmud (3rd to 5th centuries).

Lemma (mathematics)<====>18634<====>Lemma (mathematics)In mathematics, a "helping theorem" or lemma (plural lemmas or lemmata) is a proven proposition which is used as a stepping stone to a larger result rather than as a statement of interest by itself.    The word derives from the Ancient Greek   ("anything which is received, such as a gift, profit, or a bribe").  Comparison with theoremThere is no formal distinction between a lemma and a theorem, only one of intention – see Theorem terminology.   However, a lemma can be considered a minor result whose sole purpose is to help prove a theorem  – a step in the direction of proof.

Median lethal dose<====>18644<====>Median lethal dose In toxicology, the median lethal dose, LD 50  (abbreviation for "lethal dose, 50%"), LC 50  (lethal concentration, 50%) or LCt 50  is a measure of the lethal dose of a toxin, radiation, or pathogen.  The value of LD 50  for a substance is the dose required to kill half the members of a tested population after a specified test duration.  LD 50  figures are frequently used as a general indicator of a substance's acute toxicity.   A lower LD 50  is indicative of increased toxicity. The test was created by J. 

Lactase<====>18645<====>Lactase   Lactase is an enzyme produced by many organisms.  It is located in the brush border of the small intestine of humans and other mammals.

Flipper (cricket)<====>18650<====>Flipper (cricket)  The flipper is the name of a particular bowling delivery used in cricket, generally by a leg spin bowler.  In essence it is a back spin ball.  Squeezed out of the front of the hand with the thumb and first and second fingers, it keeps deceptively low after pitching and can accordingly be very difficult to play.  The flipper is comparable to a riseball in fast-pitch softball.   By putting backspin on the ball the Magnus effect results in air travelling over the top of the ball quickly and cleanly whilst air travelling under the ball is turbulent.

Lateral consonant<====>18678<====>Lateral consonant  A lateral is an l-like consonant in which the airstream proceeds along the sides of the tongue, but it is blocked by the tongue from going through the middle of the mouth. For the most common laterals, the tip of the tongue makes contact with the upper teeth (see dental consonant) or the upper gum (see alveolar consonant), but there are many other possible places for laterals to be made.  The most common laterals are approximants and belong to the class of liquids, but lateral fricatives and affricates are also common in some parts of the world. 

Liquid consonant<====>18679<====>Liquid consonant In phonetics, liquids or liquid consonants are a class of consonants consisting of lateral consonants like 'l' together with rhotics like 'r'.  Ladefoged and Maddieson (1996), p.  182 DistributionLiquids as a class often behave in a similar way in the phonotactics of a language: for example, they often have the greatest freedom in occurring in consonant clusters.   In many languages, such as Japanese and Korean, there is a single liquid phoneme that has both lateral and rhotic allophones.  English has two liquid phonemes, one lateral,   and one rhotic,  , exemplified in the words led and red.

Lint (software)<====>18692<====>Lint (software)  A linter or lint refers to tools that analyze source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.   The term is originated from a Unix utility that examined C language source code.    HistoryStephen C.  Johnson, a computer scientist at Bell Labs, came up with lint in 1978 while debugging the Yacc grammar he was writing for C and dealing with portability issues stemming from porting Unix to a 32-bit machine.    The term "lint" was derived from the name of the undesirable bits of fiber and fluff found in sheep's wool.

Live-bearing aquarium fish<====>18694<====>Live-bearing aquarium fishLive-bearing aquarium fish, often simply called livebearers, are fish that retain the eggs inside the body and give birth to live, free-swimming young.  Among aquarium fish, livebearers are nearly all members of the Poeciliidae family and include guppies, mollies, platies and swordtails. The advantages of livebearing to the aquarist are that the newborn juvenile fish are larger than newly-hatched fry, have a lower chance of mortality and are easier to care for.  Unusual livebearers include seahorses and pipefish, where the males care for the young, and certain cichlids that are mouthbrooders, with the parent incubating the eggs in the buccal cavity.

Lee Van Cleef<====>18706<====>Lee Van Cleef  Clarence Leroy Van Cleef Jr.  (January 9, 1925 – December 16, 1989), was an American actor whose sinister features overshadowed his acting skills and typecast him as a minor villain for a decade before he achieved stardom in Spaghetti Westerns such as  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.  Hatchet-faced with  piercing eyes, he declined to have his hook nose  altered to play a sympathetic character in his film debut, High Noon, and was relegated to a non-speaking outlaw as a result.  After suffering serious injuries in a car crash, Van Cleef began to lose interest in his apparently waning career by the time Sergio Leone gave him a major role in For a Few Dollars More. 

Luigi Pirandello<====>18707<====>Luigi Pirandello   Luigi Pirandellohey (Pirandello) ( ; Girgenti, today known as Agrigento, 28 June 1867 – Rome 10 December 1936) was an Italian dramatist, novelist, poet and short story writer whose greatest contributions were his plays.

Luke the Evangelist<====>18710<====>Luke the Evangelist  Luke the Evangelist (Latin: Lūcās,  , Loukãs,  , Lūqās,  , Lūqā’) is one of the Four Evangelists—the four traditionally ascribed authors of the canonical Gospels.  The early church fathers ascribed to him authorship of both the Gospel according to Luke and the book of the Acts of the Apostles, which would mean Luke contributed over a quarter of the text of the New Testament, more than any other author.  Prominent figures in early Christianity such as Jerome and Eusebius later reaffirmed his authorship, although the fragile evidence  of the identity of the author of the works has led to discussion in scholarly circles, both secular and religious.

List of Latin place names in Continental Europe, Ireland and Scandinavia<====>18717<====>List of Latin place names in Continental Europe, Ireland and Scandinavia This list includes European countries and regions that were part of the Roman Empire, or that were given Latin place names in historical references.  As a large portion of the latter were only created during the Middle Ages, often based on scholarly etiology, this is not to be confused with a list of the actual names modern regions and settlements bore during the classical era. BackgroundUntil the Modern Era, Latin was the common language for scholarship and mapmaking.  During the 19th and 20th centuries, German scholars in particular have made significant contributions to the study of historical place names, or Ortsnamenkunde. 

Lodovico Ferrari<====>18720<====>Lodovico Ferrari Lodovico de Ferrari (2 February 1522 – 5 October 1565) was an Italian mathematician. Born in Bologna, Italy, Lodovico's grandfather, Bartholomew de Ferrari, was forced out of Milan to Bologna.  Lodovico settled in Bologna, Italy and he began his career as the servant of Gerolamo Cardano.   He was extremely bright, so Cardano started teaching him mathematics.   Ferrari aided Cardano on his solutions for quadratic equations and cubic equations, and was mainly responsible for the solution of quartic equations that Cardano published.  While still in his teens, Ferrari was able to obtain a prestigious teaching post in Rome after Cardano resigned from it and recommended him. 

Lymphedema<====>18722<====>Lymphedema  Lymphedema, also known as lymphoedema and lymphatic edema, is a condition of localized fluid retention and tissue swelling caused by a compromised lymphatic system, which normally returns interstitial fluid to the thoracic duct, then the bloodstream.  The condition can be inherited or can be caused by a birth defect, though it is frequently caused by cancer treatments and by parasitic infections.  Though incurable and progressive, a number of treatments can ameliorate symptoms.  Tissues with lymphedema are at high risk of infection.  Signs and symptomsThe clinical manifestation and presentation of symptoms of lymphedema develop following a significant degree of injury.

Law of dilution<====>18728<====>Law of dilution Wilhelm Ostwald’s dilution law is a relationship between the dissociation constant   and the degree of dissociation   of a weak electrolyte.  The law takes the form K_d = \cfrac\ce{[A+] [B^-]}\ce{[AB]} = \frac{\alpha^2}{1-\alpha} \cdot c_0  Where the square brackets denote concentration, and   is the total concentration of electrolyte. Concerning conductivity, this results in the following relation: K_c = \cfrac{\Lambda_c^2}{(\Lambda_0 - \Lambda_c)\Lambda_0} \cdot c  DerivationConsider a binary electrolyte AB which dissociates reversibly into A +  and B −  ions.  Ostwald noted that  the law of mass action can be applied to such systems as dissociating electrolytes.

Lycopene<====>18735<====>Lycopene Lycopene from the neo-Latin Lycopersicum, the tomato species, is a bright red carotene and carotenoid pigment and phytochemical found in tomatoes and other red fruits and vegetables, such as red carrots, watermelons, gac, and papayas, although not in strawberries or cherries.   Although lycopene is chemically a carotene, it has no vitamin A activity.Foods that are not red may also contain lycopene, such as asparagus and parsley.    In plants, algae, and other photosynthetic organisms, lycopene is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of many carotenoids, including beta-carotene, which is responsible for yellow, orange, or red pigmentation, photosynthesis, and photoprotection.

Laika<====>18739<====>Laika  Laika ( ; c.  1954 – 3 November 1957) was a Soviet space dog who became one of the first animals in space, and the first animal to orbit the Earth.  Laika, a stray dog from the streets of Moscow, was selected to be the occupant of the Soviet spacecraft Sputnik 2 that was launched into outer space on 3 November 1957. Little was known about the impact of spaceflight on living creatures at the time of Laika's mission, and the technology to de-orbit had not yet been developed, so Laika's survival was never expected.  Some scientists believed humans would be unable to survive the launch or the conditions of outer space, so engineers viewed flights by animals as a necessary precursor to human missions.

Mural<====>18816<====>Mural A mural is any piece of artwork painted or applied directly on a wall, ceiling or other permanent surface.  A distinguishing characteristic of mural painting is that the architectural elements of the given space are harmoniously incorporated into the picture. Some wall paintings are painted on large canvases, which are then attached to the wall (e. g. , with marouflage).  Whether these works can be accurately called "murals" is a subject of some controversy in the art world,  but the technique has been in common use since the late 19th century.    HistoryMurals of sorts date to Upper Paleolithic times such as the paintings in the Chauvet Cave in Ardèche department of southern France (around 30,000 BC). 

Microeconomics<====>18819<====>Microeconomics   Microeconomics (from Greek prefix mikro- meaning "small") is a branch of economics that studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources and the interactions among these individuals and firms. One goal of microeconomics is to analyze the market mechanisms that establish relative prices among goods and services and allocate limited resources among alternative uses.  Microeconomics shows conditions under which free markets lead to desirable allocations.  It also analyzes market failure, where markets fail to produce efficient results. Microeconomics stands in contrast to macroeconomics, which involves "the sum total of economic activity, dealing with the issues of growth, inflation, and unemployment and with national policies relating to these issues". 

Macroeconomics<====>18820<====>Macroeconomics Macroeconomics (from the Greek prefix makro- meaning "large" and economics) is a branch of economics dealing with the performance, structure, behavior, and decision-making of an economy as a whole.  This includes regional, national, and global economies.   Macroeconomists study aggregated indicators such as GDP, unemployment rates, national income, price indices, and the interrelations among the different sectors of the economy to better understand how the whole economy functions.  Macroeconomists develop models that explain the relationship between such factors as national income, output, consumption, unemployment, inflation, savings, investment, international trade and international finance. While macroeconomics is a broad field of study, there are two areas of research that are emblematic of the discipline: the attempt to understand the causes and consequences of short-run fluctuations in national income (the business cycle), and the attempt to understand the determinants of long-run economic growth (increases in national income).

MD5<====>18826<====>MD5  The MD5 algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value.  Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities.  It can still be used as a checksum to verify data integrity, but only against unintentional corruption. Like most hash functions, MD5 is neither encryption nor encoding.  It can be cracked by brute-force attack and suffers from extensive vulnerabilities as detailed in the security section below. MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function MD4. 

Magic: The Gathering<====>18830<====>Magic: The Gathering Magic: The Gathering is a trading card game and a digital collectible card game.   It was created by Richard Garfield. First published in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast, Magic was the first trading card game created and it continues to thrive, with approximately twenty million players  .  Magic can be played by two or more players in various formats, which fall into two categories: constructed and limited.  Limited formats involve players building a deck spontaneously out of a pool of random cards with a minimum deck size of 40 cards. 

Mathematics<====>18831<====>Mathematics    Mathematics (from Greek μάθημα máthēma, "knowledge, study, learning") is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers),    structure,    space,  and change. There are many views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.    Mathematicians seek out patterns   and use them to formulate new conjectures.  Mathematicians resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof.  When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature. 

Middle Ages<====>18836<====>Middle Ages    In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages (or Medieval Period) lasted from the 5th to the 15th century.  It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery.  The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period.  The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. Population decline, counterurbanisation, invasion, and movement of peoples, which had begun in Late Antiquity, continued in the Early Middle Ages. 

Median<====>18837<====>Median The median is the value separating the higher half of a data sample, a population, or a probability distribution, from the lower half.  For a data set, it may be thought of as the "middle" value.  For example, in the data set {1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}, the median is 6, the fourth largest, and also the fourth smallest, number in the sample.  For a continuous probability distribution, the median is the value such that a number is equally likely to fall above or below it. The median is a commonly used measure of the properties of a data set in statistics and probability theory. 

Mammal<====>18838<====>MammalMammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (  from Latin   "breast"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles (including birds) by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones, and mammary glands.  Females of all mammal species nurse their young with milk, secreted from the mammary glands. Mammals include the largest animal on the planet, the blue whale.  The basic body type is a terrestrial quadruped, but some mammals are adapted for life at sea, in the air, in trees, underground or on two legs. 

Music<====>18839<====>MusicMusic is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time.  The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound).  Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements.  Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments.

Mouse<====>18845<====>Mouse  A mouse (plural: mice) is a small rodent characteristically having a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail and a high breeding rate.  The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (Mus musculus).  It is also a popular pet.  In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally common.  They are known to invade homes for food and shelter. Domestic mice sold as pets often differ substantially in size from the common house mouse.  This is attributable both to breeding and to different conditions in the wild. 

Multics<====>18847<====>Multics  Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) is an influential Dennis M.  Ritchie, "The Evolution of the Unix Time-sharing System", Communications of the ACM, Vol.  17, 1984, pp.  365-375.    early time-sharing operating system, based around the concept of a single-level memory.  Virtually all modern operating systems are heavily influenced by Multics; often through Unix, which was created by people who had worked on Multics - either directly (Linux, macOS) or indirectly (Microsoft Windows NT). OverviewInitial planning and development for Multics started in 1964, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Originally it was a cooperative project led by MIT (Project MAC with Fernando Corbató) along with General Electric and Bell Labs. 

Marxist film theory<====>18849<====>Marxist film theory  Marxist film theory is one of the oldest forms of film theory.   OverviewSergei Eisenstein and many other Soviet filmmakers in the 1920s expressed ideas of Marxism through film.   In fact, the Hegelian dialectic was considered best displayed in film editing through the Kuleshov Experiment and the development of montage. While this structuralist approach to Marxism and filmmaking was used, the more vociferous complaint that the Russian filmmakers had was with the narrative structure of the cinema of the United States. Eisenstein's solution was to shun narrative structure by eliminating the individual protagonist and tell stories where the action is moved by the group and the story is told through a clash of one image against the next (whether in composition, motion, or idea) so that the audience is never lulled into believing that they are watching something that has not been worked over. 

Morpheme<====>18852<====>Morpheme  A morpheme is the smallest grammatical unit in a language.  In other words, it is the smallest meaningful unit of a language.  The linguistics field of study dedicated to morphemes is called morphology.  A morpheme is not identical to a word, and the principal difference between the two is that a morpheme may or may not stand alone, whereas a word, by definition, is freestanding.  When it stands by itself, it is considered as a root because it has a meaning of its own (e. g.  the morpheme cat) and when it depends on another morpheme to express an idea, it is an affix because it has a grammatical function (e. 

MTV<====>18856<====>MTV    MTV (originally an initialism of Music Television) is an American cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Media Networks (a division of Viacom) and headquartered in New York City.  Launched on August 1, 1981,  the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as "video jockeys" (VJs).   At first, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily teenagers, particularly high school and college students.  MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. 

Mustelidae<====>18857<====>Mustelidae The Mustelidae (from Latin mustela, weasel) are a family of carnivorous mammals, including weasels, badgers, otters, martens, mink, and wolverines, among others.  Mustelids are diverse and the largest family in the order Carnivora.  The internal classification is still disputed, with rival proposals containing between two and eight subfamilies.  One study, published in 2008, questions the long-accepted Mustelinae subfamily, and suggests that the Mustelidae consist of four major clades and three much smaller lineages. VarietyMustelids vary greatly in size and behaviour.  The least weasel can be under a foot in length, while the giant otter can measure up to   and sea otters can exceed   in weight. 

Maryland<====>18858<====>Maryland    {{Infobox U. S.  state symbols }} Maryland ( )  is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D. C.  to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east.  The state's largest city is Baltimore, and its capital is Annapolis.  Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State, the Free State, and the Chesapeake Bay State.  The state is named after the English queen Henrietta Maria of France.  One of the original Thirteen Colonies, Maryland is considered to be the birthplace of religious freedom in America, "George Calvert and Cecilius Calvert, Barons Baltimore" William Hand Browne, Nabu Press (August 1, 2010), "Reconstructing the Brick Chapel of 1667" Page 1, See section entitled "The Birthplace of Religious Freedom"    when it was formed by George Calvert in the early 17th century as an intended refuge for persecuted Catholics from England. 

Michigan<====>18859<====>Michigan  Michigan ( ) is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States. The state's name, Michigan, originates from the (Ojibwe word) mishigamaa, meaning "large water" or "large lake". Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States, with the 11th most extensive total area, and the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River.  i. e. , including water that is part of state territory.  Georgia is the largest state by land area east of the Mississippi and Michigan the second-largest. 

Minimum wage<====>18862<====>Minimum wage A minimum wage is the lowest remuneration that employers can legally pay their workers.  Equivalently, it is the price floor below which workers may not sell their labor.  Although minimum wage laws are in effect in many jurisdictions, differences of opinion exist about the benefits and drawbacks of a minimum wage.  Supporters of the minimum wage say it increases the standard of living of workers, reduces poverty, reduces inequality, and boosts morale.   In contrast, opponents of the minimum wage say it increases poverty, increases unemployment (particularly among unskilled or inexperienced workers) and is damaging to businesses, because excessively high minimum wages require businesses to raise the prices of their product or service to accommodate the extra expense of paying a higher wage.

Macbeth<====>18866<====>Macbeth    Macbeth ( ; full title The Tragedy of Macbeth) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare; it is thought to have been first performed in 1606.   It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake.  Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I, who was patron of Shakespeare's acting company, Macbeth most clearly reflects the playwright's relationship with his sovereign.   It was first published in the Folio of 1623, possibly from a prompt book, and is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy. 

Minor Threat<====>18870<====>Minor Threat Minor Threat was a hardcore punk band, formed in 1980 in Washington, D. C.  and disbanded in 1983.  The band was relatively short-lived, but had a strong influence on the punk scene, both stylistically and in establishing a "do it yourself" ethic for music distribution and concert promotion.  Minor Threat's song "Straight Edge" became the eventual basis of the straight edge movement, with the band often professing their own "straight edge" ideals.   AllMusic described Minor Threat's music as "iconic"  and noted that their groundbreaking music "has held up better than [that of] most of their contemporaries. 

Mental event<====>18875<====>Mental event A mental event is anything which happens within the mind or mind substitute of a conscious individual.  Examples include thoughts, feelings, decisions, dreams, and realizations.  Some believe that mental events are not limited to human thought but can be associated with animals  and artificial intelligence  as well.  Whether mental events are identical to complex physical events, or whether such an identity even makes sense, is central to the mind-body problem. Relation to mind-body problemSome state that the mental and the physical are the very same property which cause any event(s).  This view is known as substance monism. 

Monopoly<====>18878<====>Monopoly  A monopoly (from Greek μόνος mónos ["alone" or "single"] and πωλεῖν pōleîn ["to sell"]) exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity.  This contrasts with a monopsony which relates to a single entity's control of a market to purchase a good or service, and with oligopoly which consists of a few sellers dominating a market.   Monopolies are thus characterized by a lack of economic competition to produce the good or service, a lack of viable substitute goods, and the possibility of a high monopoly price well above the seller's marginal cost that leads to a high monopoly profit. 

Massachusetts Institute of Technology<====>18879<====>Massachusetts Institute of Technology    The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States.  Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering.  Researchers worked on computers, radar and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War.  Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian.  The current   campus opened in 1916 and extends over   along the northern bank of the Charles River basin. 

Monopolistic competition<====>18880<====>Monopolistic competition Monopolistic competition is a type of imperfect competition such that many producers sell products that are differentiated from one another (e. g.  by branding or quality) and hence are not perfect substitutes.  In monopolistic competition, a firm takes the prices charged by its rivals as given and ignores the impact of its own prices on the prices of other firms.    In the presence of coercive government, monopolistic competition will fall into government-granted monopoly.  Unlike perfect competition, the firm maintains spare capacity.  Models of monopolistic competition are often used to model industries. 

Mathematical induction<====>18881<====>Mathematical induction Mathematical induction is a mathematical proof technique, a form of direct proof, usually done in two steps.  It is used to prove a given statement about any well-ordered set.  Most commonly, the well-ordered set is the set of natural numbers.   The first step, called the base case or basis, proves that the theorem is true for the number one.   The second step, called the inductive step, proves that, if the theorem is true for a given number, then it is also true for the next number.   These two steps establish the theorem for all natural numbers. 

Morton Downey Jr.<====>18885<====>Morton Downey Jr.   Sean Morton Downey (December 9, 1932 – March 12, 2001), better known by his stage name Morton Downey Jr. , was an American television talk show host of the late-1980s who pioneered the "trash TV" format on his program The Morton Downey Jr.  Show.    The film company Ironbound Films produced a documentary film about Downey titled Évocateur: The Morton Downey Jr.  Movie, which premiered April 19, 2012, at the 2012 Tribeca Film Festival. Early lifeDowney's parents were also in show business; his father, Morton Downey, was a popular singer, and his mother, Barbara Bennett, was a singer and dancer. 

List of male singles tennis players<====>18886<====>List of male singles tennis players  This is a list of top international male singles tennis players, both past and present. It includes players who have been officially ranked among the top 25 singles players in the world during the "Open Era"; been ranked in the top 10 prior to the Open Era; have been a singles quarterfinalist or better at a Grand Slam tournament; have reached the finals of or won the season-ending event; or have been singles medalists at the Olympics. Players who have won more than one Grand Slam singles title or have been ranked world no. 

Metaphilosophy<====>18887<====>Metaphilosophy Metaphilosophy (sometimes called philosophy of philosophy) is "the investigation of the nature of philosophy".   Its subject matter includes the aims of philosophy, the boundaries of philosophy, and its methods.    Thus, while philosophy characteristically inquires into the nature of being, the reality of objects, the possibility of knowledge, the nature of truth, and so on, metaphilosophy is the self-reflective inquiry into the nature, aims, and methods of the activity that makes these kinds of inquiries, by asking what is philosophy itself, what sorts of questions it should ask, how it might pose and answer them, and what it can achieve in doing so. 

Mandolin<====>18888<====>Mandolin  A mandolin (   ; literally "small mandola") is a stringed musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or "pick".  It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison (8 strings), although five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist.  The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths.  It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass. There are many styles of mandolin, but three are common, the Neapolitan or round-backed mandolin, the carved-top mandolin and the flat-backed mandolin. 

Microphotonics<====>18889<====>Microphotonics Microphotonics is a branch of technology that deals with directing light on a microscopic scale.   It is used in optical networking. Microphotonics employs at least two different materials with a large differential index of refraction to squeeze the light down to a small size.   Generally speaking, virtually all of microphotonics relies on Fresnel reflection to guide the light.   If the photons reside mainly in the higher index material, the confinement is due to total internal reflection.   If the confinement is due many distributed Fresnel reflections, the device is termed a photonic crystal. 

Microsoft Windows<====>18890<====>Microsoft WindowsMicrosoft Windows is a group of several graphical operating system families, all of which are developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft.  Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry.  Active Windows families include Windows NT and Windows Embedded; these may encompass subfamilies, e. g.  Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server.  Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone. Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20, 1985, as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs). 

Mojo (African-American culture)<====>18892<====>Mojo (African-American culture) Mojo  , in the African-American folk belief called hoodoo, is an amulet consisting of a flannel bag containing one or more magical items.  It is a "prayer in a bag", or a spell that can be carried with or on the host's body. Alternative American names for the mojo bag include hand, mojo hand, conjure hand, lucky hand, conjure bag, trick bag, root bag, toby, jomo, and gris-gris bag.  Bradley, Jude; Coen, Cheré Dastugue (2010).  Magic's in the Bag: Creating Spellbinding Gris Gris and Sachets.  Woodbury, Minnesota: Llewellyn.

Matt Groening<====>18894<====>Matt Groening   Matthew Abraham Groening (   ; born February 15, 1954)    is an American cartoonist, writer, producer, animator, and voice actor.  He is the creator of the comic strip Life in Hell (1977–2012) and the television series The Simpsons (1989–present), Futurama (1999–2003, 2008–2013), and the upcoming Disenchantment (2018).  The Simpsons has gone on to become the longest-running U. S.  primetime-television series in history, as well as the longest-running animated series and sitcom. Groening made his first professional cartoon sale of Life in Hell to the avant-garde Wet magazine in 1978. 

Metaphysics<====>18895<====>Metaphysics  Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy exploring the fundamental questions, including the nature of concepts like being, existence, and reality.  Metaphysics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy).   It has two branches – cosmology and ontology.  Traditional metaphysics seeks to answer, in a "suitably abstract and fully general manner", the questions:  What is there?And what is it like?Topics of metaphysical investigation include existence, objects and their properties, space and time, cause and effect, and possibility.  A central branch of metaphysics is ontology, the investigation into the basic categories of being and how they relate to one another. 

Human spaceflight<====>18896<====>Human spaceflightHuman spaceflight (also referred to as crewed spaceflight or manned spaceflight) is space travel with a crew or passengers aboard the spacecraft.  Spacecraft carrying people may be operated directly, by human crew, or it may be either remotely operated from ground stations on Earth or be autonomous, able to carry out a specific mission with no human involvement. The first human spaceflight was launched by the Soviet Union on 12 April 1961 as a part of the Vostok program, with cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin aboard.  Humans have been continuously present in space for   on the International Space Station. 

Mendelevium<====>18899<====>Mendelevium Mendelevium is a synthetic element with chemical symbol Md (formerly Mv) and atomic number 101.  A metallic radioactive transuranic element in the actinide series, it is the first element that currently cannot be produced in macroscopic quantities through neutron bombardment of lighter elements.  It is the third-to-last actinide and the ninth transuranic element.  It can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles.  A total of sixteen mendelevium isotopes are known, the most stable being  258 Md with a half-life of 51 days; nevertheless, the shorter-lived  256 Md (half-life 1. 

Modus ponens<====>18900<====>Modus ponens   Modus ponens, a short form of  modus ponendo ponens (Latin for "the way that affirms by affirming"; generally abbreviated to MP or modus ponens )  is a rule of inference in propositional logic.    It is also called implication elimination as this inference rule can be used to replace the condition by the consequence in the arguments.  It can be summarized as "(1) (P implies Q) and (2) (P) are asserted to be true, and therefore Q must be true. " The history of modus ponens goes back to antiquity.  Modus ponens is closely related to another valid form of argument, modus tollens. 

Modus tollens<====>18901<====>Modus tollens   In propositional logic, modus tollens(or modus tollendo tollens and also denying the consequent)  (Latin for "the way that denies by denying")  is a valid argument form and a rule of inference.   It is an application of the general truth that if a statement is true, then so is its contra-positive. The first to explicitly describe the argument form modus tollens were the Stoics.  The inference rule modus tollens validates the inference from  P  implies  Q  and the contradictory of  Q  to the contradictory of  P . 

Mathematician<====>18902<====>Mathematician  A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his or her work, typically to solve mathematical problems. Mathematics is concerned with numbers, data, quantity, structure, space, models, and change. History One of the earliest known mathematicians was Thales of Miletus (c.  624–c. 546 BC); he has been hailed as the first true mathematician and the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed.   He is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to Thales' Theorem. The number of known mathematicians grew when Pythagoras of Samos (c. 

Microfluidics<====>18906<====>MicrofluidicsMicrofluidics deals with the behaviour, precise control and manipulation of fluids that are geometrically constrained to a small, typically sub-millimeter, scale.  It is a multidisciplinary field at the intersection of engineering, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, nanotechnology, and biotechnology, with practical applications in the design of systems in which low volumes of fluids are processed to achieve multiplexing, automation, and high-throughput screening.  Microfluidics emerged in the beginning of the 1980s and is used in the development of inkjet printheads, DNA chips, lab-on-a-chip technology, micro-propulsion, and micro-thermal technologies. Typically, micro means one of the following features:small volumes (μL, nL, pL, fL)small sizelow energy consumptioneffects of the microdomainTypically fluids are moved, mixed, separated or otherwise processed. 

Mersenne prime<====>18908<====>Mersenne prime In mathematics, a Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two.   That is, it is a prime number of the form   for some integer  .   They are named after Marin Mersenne, a French Minim friar, who studied them in the early 17th century. The exponents   which give Mersenne primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, . . .    and the resulting Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, 127, 8191, 131071, 524287, 2147483647, . . .   . 

Magnesium<====>18909<====>Magnesium    Magnesium is a chemical element with symbol Mg and atomic number 12.  It is a shiny gray solid which bears a close physical resemblance to the other five elements in the second column (group 2, or alkaline earth metals) of the periodic table: all group 2 elements have the same electron configuration in the outer electron shell and a similar crystal structure. Magnesium is the ninth most abundant element in the universe.    It is produced in large, aging stars from the sequential addition of three helium nuclei to a carbon nucleus.  When such stars explode as supernovas, much of the magnesium is expelled into the interstellar medium where it may recycle into new star systems. 

Markup language<====>18910<====>Markup language A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text.   The idea and terminology evolved from the "marking up" of paper manuscripts, i. e. , the revision instructions by editors, traditionally written with a blue pencil on authors' manuscripts.  In digital media this "blue pencil instruction text" was replaced by tags, that is, instructions are expressed directly by tags or "instruction text encapsulated by tags. " Examples include typesetting instructions such as those found in troff, TeX and LaTeX, or structural markers such as XML tags. 

Meta-ethics<====>18917<====>Meta-ethicsMeta-ethics is the branch of ethics that seeks to understand the nature of ethical properties, statements, attitudes, and judgments.  Meta-ethics is one of the three branches of ethics generally studied by philosophers, the others being normative ethics and applied ethics. While normative ethics addresses such questions as "What should I do?", thus endorsing some ethical evaluations and rejecting others, meta-ethics addresses questions such as "What is goodness?" and "How can we tell what is good from what is bad?", seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations. Some theorists argue that a metaphysical account of morality is necessary for the proper evaluation of actual moral theories and for making practical moral decisions; others reason from opposite premises and  suggest that we must impart ideas of moral intuition onto proper action before we can give a proper account of morality's metaphysics. 

Mormons<====>18925<====>Mormons    Mormons ( ) are a religious and cultural group related to Mormonism, the principal branch of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity, initiated by Joseph Smith in upstate New York during the 1820s.  After Smith's death in 1844, the Mormons followed Brigham Young to what would become the Utah Territory.  Today, most Mormons are understood to be members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).  Some Mormons are also either independent or non-practicing.  The center of Mormon cultural influence is in Utah, and North America has more Mormons than any other continent, though the majority of Mormons live outside the United States. 

Manitoba<====>18926<====>Manitoba    Manitoba ( ) is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada.  It is one of the three prairie provinces (with Alberta and Saskatchewan) and Canada's fifth-most populous province with its estimated 1. 3 million people.  Manitoba covers   with a widely varied landscape.  The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west, the territories of Nunavut to the north, and Northwest Territories to the northwest, and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south. Aboriginal peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years. 

Mount Logan<====>18929<====>Mount Logan   Mount Logan   is the highest mountain in Canada and the second-highest peak in North America, after Denali.  The mountain was named after Sir William Edmond Logan, a Canadian geologist and founder of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC).  Mount Logan is located within Kluane National Park Reserve  in southwestern Yukon, less than   north of the Yukon/Alaska border.   Mount Logan is the source of the Hubbard and Logan Glaciers.  Logan is believed to have the largest base circumference of any non-volcanic mountain on Earth (a large number of shield volcanoes are much larger in size and mass), including a massif with eleven peaks over  . 

Subject (philosophy)<====>18930<====>Subject (philosophy)   A subject is a being who has a unique consciousness and/or unique personal experiences, or an entity that has a relationship with another entity that exists outside itself (called an "object").  A subject is an observer and an object is a thing observed.  This concept is especially important in Continental philosophy, where 'the Subject' is a central term in debates over human autonomy and the nature of the self.  The sharp distinction between subject and object corresponds to the distinction, in the philosophy of René Descartes, between thought and extension.  Descartes believed that thought (subjectivity) was the essence of the mind, and that extension (the occupation of space) was the essence of matter. 

Media bias<====>18932<====>Media bias   Media bias is the bias or perceived bias of journalists and news producers within the mass media in the selection of events and stories that are reported and how they are covered.   The term "media bias" implies a pervasive or widespread bias contravening the standards of journalism, rather than the perspective of an individual journalist or article.  The direction and degree of media bias in various countries is widely disputed. Practical limitations to media neutrality include the inability of journalists to report all available stories and facts, and the requirement that selected facts be linked into a coherent narrative. 

Muhammad<====>18934<====>Muhammad Muhammad Full name: Abū al-Qāsim Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib ibn Hāšim ( , lit: Father of Qasim Muhammad son of Abd Allah son of Abdul-Muttalib son of Hashim)  ( ;  ; Classical Arabic pronunciation  French: Mahomet  ; latinized as Mahometus c.  570 CE – 8 June 632 CE) Elizabeth Goldman (1995), p.  63, gives 8 June 632 CE, the dominant Islamic tradition.  Many earlier (primarily non-Islamic) traditions refer to him as still alive at the time of the invasion of Palestine.  See Stephen J. 

Morse code<====>18935<====>Morse code  Morse code is a method of transmitting text information as a series of on-off tones, lights, or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observer without special equipment.  It is named for Samuel F.  B.  Morse, an inventor of the telegraph.  The International Morse Code  encodes the ISO basic Latin alphabet, some extra Latin letters, the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns) as standardized sequences of short and long signals called "dots" and "dashes",    or "dits" and "dahs", as in amateur radio practice. 

Emergency contraception<====>18939<====>Emergency contraception Emergency contraception (EC), or emergency postcoital contraception, are birth control measures that may be used after sexual intercourse to prevent pregnancy. Forms of EC include:Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs)—sometimes simply referred to as emergency contraceptives (ECs) or the "morning-after pill"—are medications intended to disrupt or delay ovulation or fertilization, which are necessary for pregnancy.p.  121: Mechanism of action Copper-releasing IUCs When used as a regular or emergency method of contraception, copper-releasing IUCs act primarily to prevent fertilization.  Emergency insertion of a copper IUC is significantly more effective than the use of ECPs, reducing the risk of pregnancy following unprotected intercourse by more than 99%. 

Meat<====>18940<====>Meat    Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food. Humans have hunted and killed animals for meat since prehistoric times.  The advent of civilization allowed the domestication of animals such as chickens, sheep, rabbits, pigs and cattle.  This eventually led to their use in meat production on an industrial scale with the aid of slaughterhouses. Meat is mainly composed of water, protein, and fat.  It is edible raw, but is normally eaten after it has been cooked and seasoned or processed in a variety of ways.  Unprocessed meat will spoil or rot within hours or days as a result of infection with and decomposition by bacteria and fungi. 

Monty Python<====>18942<====>Monty PythonMonty Python (also known as The Pythons)   were a British surreal comedy group who created their sketch comedy show Monty Python's Flying Circus, which first aired on the BBC in 1969.  Forty-five episodes were made over four series.  The Python phenomenon developed from the television series into something larger in scope and impact, including touring stage shows, films, numerous albums, several books, and musicals.  The Pythons' influence on comedy has been compared to the Beatles' influence on music.Their sketch show has been referred to as "not only one of the more enduring icons of 1970s British popular culture, but also an important moment in the evolution of television comedy. 

Married... with Children<====>18943<====>Married. . .  with Children Married. . .  with Children is an American television sitcom that aired on Fox, created by Michael G.  Moye and Ron Leavitt.

Mentha<====>18955<====>Mentha Mentha (also known as mint, from Greek míntha,  Linear B mi-ta)  is a genus of plants in the family Lamiaceae (mint family).It is estimated that 13 to 18 species exist, and the exact distinction between species is still unclear.Hybridization between some of the species occurs naturally.  Many other hybrids, as well as numerous cultivars, are known. The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution across Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and North America.    Mints are aromatic, almost exclusively perennial, rarely annual herbs.   They have wide-spreading underground and overground stolons  and erect, square,    branched stems. 

Marjoram<====>18956<====>Marjoram  Marjoram    (Origanum majorana) is a somewhat cold-sensitive perennial herb or undershrub with sweet pine and citrus flavors.  In some Middle Eastern countries, marjoram is synonymous with oregano, and there the names sweet marjoram and knotted marjoram are used to distinguish it from other plants of the genus Origanum.  It is also called pot marjoram,    although this name is also used for other cultivated species of Origanum. HistoryThe name marjoram (Old French majorane, Medieval Latin majorana) does not directly derive from the Latin word maior (major).   Marjoram is indigenous to Cyprus and southern Turkey, and was known to the Greeks and Romans as a symbol of happiness. 

Medicine<====>18957<====>Medicine    Medicine is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease.  Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness.  Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.  Medicine has existed for thousands of years, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. 

2001 Mars Odyssey<====>18959<====>2001 Mars OdysseyDISPLAYTITLE 2001 Mars Odyssey is a robotic spacecraft orbiting the planet Mars.  The project was developed by NASA, and contracted out to Lockheed Martin, with an expected cost for the entire mission of US$297 million.  Its mission is to use spectrometers and a thermal imager to detect evidence of past or present water and ice, as well as study the planet's geology and radiation environment.It is hoped that the data Odyssey obtains will help answer the question of whether life has ever existed on Mars and create a risk-assessment of the radiation future astronauts on Mars might experience. 

Macedonian phalanx<====>18960<====>Macedonian phalanx The Macedonian phalanx is an infantry formation developed by Philip II and used by his son Alexander the Great to conquer the Achaemenid Empire and other armies.   Phalanxes remained dominant on battlefields throughout the Hellenistic period, although wars had developed into more protracted operations generally involving sieges and naval combat as much as pitched battles, until they were ultimately displaced by the Roman legions. DevelopmentPhilip II spent much of his youth as a hostage at Thebes, where he studied under the renowned general Epaminondas, whose reforms were the basis for the phalanx.   Phalangites were professional soldiers, and were among the first troops ever to be drilled, thereby allowing them to execute complex maneuvers well beyond the reach of most other armies. 

Madagascar<====>18964<====>Madagascar Madagascar ( ;  ), officially the Republic of Madagascar (   ;  ), and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of East Africa.  The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands.  Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation.  Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. 

Flowering plant<====>18967<====>Flowering plant The flowering plants, also known as angiosperms, Angiospermae  or Magnoliophyta,  are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approximately 13,164 known genera and c.  295,383 known species.Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants.  However, they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds.  Etymologically,   means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure; in other words, a fruiting plant.  The term comes from the Greek words angeion ("case" or "casing") and sperma ("seed"). 

Malvales<====>18968<====>Malvales The Malvales are an order of flowering plants.  As circumscribed by APG II-system, the order includes about 6000 species within 9 families.  The order is placed in the eurosids II, which are part of the eudicots. The plants are mostly shrubs and trees; most of its families have a cosmopolitan distribution in the tropics and subtropics, with limited expansion into temperate regions.  An interesting distribution occurs in Madagascar, where three endemic families of Malvales (Sphaerosepalaceae, Sarcolaenaceae and Diegodendraceae) occur. Many species of Malvaceae sensu lato are known for their wood, with that of Ochroma (balsa) being known for its lightness, and that of Tilia (lime, linden, or basswood) as a popular wood for carving. 

Myrtales<====>18969<====>Myrtales The Myrtales are an order of flowering plants placed as a sister to the eurosids II clade as of the publishing of the Eucalyptus grandis genome in June 2014.The APG III system of classification for angiosperms still places it within the eurosids.  The following families are included as of APG III:   Alzateaceae  S.  A.  Graham Combretaceae  R.  Br.   (leadwood family)Crypteroniaceae  A.  DC.  Lythraceae  J.  St. -Hil.   (loosestrife and pomegranate family)Melastomataceae  Juss.   (including Memecylaceae  DC. 

Malpighiales<====>18970<====>Malpighiales  The Malpighiales comprise one of the largest orders of flowering plants, containing about 16,000 species, about 7. 8% of the eudicots.  Peter F.  Stevens (2001 onwards).  Malpighiales At: Angiosperm Phylogeny Website At: Missouri Botanical Garden Website  The order is very diverse, containing plants as different as the willow, violet, poinsettia, and coca plant, and are hard to recognize except with molecular phylogenetic evidence.  It is not part of any of the classification systems based only on plant morphology.  Molecular clock calculations estimate the origin of stem group Malpighiales at around 100 million years ago (Mya) and the origin of crown group Malpighiales at about 90 Mya. 

Miranda warning<====>18972<====>Miranda warning DISPLAYTITLE The Miranda warning, which also can be referred to as a person's Miranda rights, is a right to silence warning given by police in the United States to criminal suspects in police custody (or in a custodial interrogation) before they are interrogated to preserve the admissibility of their statements against them in criminal proceedings. A typical Miranda warning can read as follows:"You have the right to remain silent.  Anything you say can be used against you.  You have the right to an attorney.  If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you by the court. 

Mississippian (geology)<====>18974<====>Mississippian (geology)  The Mississippian (also known as Lower Carboniferous or Early Carboniferous) is a subperiod in the geologic timescale or a subsystem of the geologic record.  It is the earliest/lowermost of two subperiods of the Carboniferous period lasting from roughly 358. 9 to 323. 2 million years ago.  As with most other geochronologic units, the rock beds that define the Mississippian are well identified, but the exact start and end dates are uncertain by a few million years.  The Mississippian is so named because rocks with this age are exposed in the Mississippi River valley.  The Mississippian was a period of marine transgression in the Northern Hemisphere: the sea level was so high that only the Fennoscandian Shield and the Laurentian Shield were dry land. 

Meiosis<====>18976<====>Meiosis  Meiosis   is a specialized type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, creating four haploid cells, each genetically distinct from the parent cell that gave rise to them.This process occurs in all sexually reproducing single-celled and multicellular eukaryotes, including animals, plants, and fungi.Bernstein H, Bernstein C, Michod RE (2011).  “Meiosis as an evolutionary adaptation for DNA repair. "  In “DNA Repair", Intech Publ (Inna Kruman, editor), Chapter 19: 357-382 DOI: 10. 5772/1751    Available online from:   Errors in meiosis resulting in aneuploidy are the leading known cause of miscarriage and the most frequent genetic cause of developmental disabilities. 

MINIX<====>18977<====>MINIX MINIX (from "mini-Unix") is a POSIX-compliant (since version 2. 0),  Unix-like computer operating system based on a microkernel architecture. Early versions of MINIX were created by Andrew S.  Tanenbaum for educational purposes.  Starting with MINIX 3, the primary aim of development shifted from education to the creation of a highly reliable and self-healing microkernel OS.  MINIX is now developed as open-source software. MINIX was first released in 1987, with its complete source code made available to universities for study in courses and research.  It has been free and open-source software since it was re-licensed under the BSD license in April 2000. 

Muscular dystrophy<====>18982<====>Muscular dystrophy  Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of muscle diseases that results in increasing weakening and breakdown of skeletal muscles over time.   The disorders differ in which muscles are primarily affected, the degree of weakness, how fast they worsen, and when symptoms begin.   Many people will eventually become unable to walk.   Some types are also associated with problems in other organs.    There are nine main categories of muscular dystrophy that contain more than thirty specific types.    The most common type is Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) which typically affects males beginning around the age of four. 

Mongols<====>18984<====>Mongols   The Mongols ( , Mongolchuud,  ) are an East-Central Asian ethnic group native to Mongolia and China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.  They also live as minorities in other regions of China (e. g.  Xinjiang), as well as in Russia.  Mongolian people belonging to the Buryat and Kalmyk subgroups live predominantly in the Russian federal subjects of Buryatia and Kalmykia. The Mongols are bound together by a common heritage and ethnic identity.  Their indigenous dialects are collectively known as the Mongolian language.  The ancestors of the modern-day Mongols are referred to as Proto-Mongols.

Merlot<====>18989<====>Merlot  Merlot is a dark blue-colored wine grape variety, that is used as both a blending grape and for varietal wines.  The name Merlot is thought to be a diminutive of merle, the French name for the blackbird, probably a reference to the color of the grape.  Its softness and "fleshiness", combined with its earlier ripening, makes Merlot a popular grape for blending with the sterner, later-ripening Cabernet Sauvignon, which tends to be higher in tannin.  J.  Robinson, J.  Harding and J.  Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 630-634, Allen Lane 2012   Along with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, Merlot is one of the primary grapes used in Bordeaux wine, and it is the most widely planted grape in the Bordeaux wine regions.

Milgram experiment<====>19009<====>Milgram experiment The Milgram experiment on obedience to authority figures was a series of social psychology experiments conducted by Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram.  They measured the willingness of study participants, men from a diverse range of occupations with varying levels of education, to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts conflicting with their personal conscience.  Participants were led to believe that they were assisting an unrelated experiment, in which they had to administer electric shocks to a "learner".  These fake electric shocks gradually increased to levels that would have been fatal had they been real. 

Miocene<====>19011<====>Miocene The Miocene (   ) is the first geological epoch of the Neogene Period and extends from about   (Ma).  The Miocene was named by Charles Lyell; its name comes from the Greek words   ( , “less”) and   ( , “new”)    and means "less recent" because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene.  The Miocene follows the Oligocene and is followed by the Pliocene. As the earth went from the Oligocene through the Miocene and into the Pliocene, the climate slowly cooled towards a series of ice ages. 

Monarch<====>19012<====>Monarch   A monarch is a sovereign head of state in a monarchy.   Webster's II New College Dictionary.  Monarch.  Houghton Mifflin.  Boston.  2001.  p.  707.A monarch may exercise the highest authority and power in the state, or others may wield that power on behalf of the monarch.  Typically a monarch either personally inherits the lawful right to exercise the state's sovereign rights (often referred to as the throne or the crown) or is selected by an established process from a family or cohort eligible to provide the nation's monarch. 

Monarchy<====>19013<====>Monarchy    A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, generally a family representing a dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and its head, the monarch, exercises the role of sovereignty.  The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (constitutional monarchy), to completely autocratic (absolute monarchy).  Traditionally the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication.  In contrast, elective monarchies require the monarch to be elected.   Both types have further variations as there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy.

Malmö<====>19021<====>Malmö   Malmö ( ;  ;  )  is the capital and largest city of the Swedish county of Scania.  Malmö is the third largest city in Sweden, after Stockholm and Gothenburg, and the sixth largest city in Scandinavia, with a population of above 300,000.   The Malmö Metropolitan Region is home to 700,000 people,  and the Øresund Region, which includes Malmö, is home to 3. 9 million people.    Malmö was one of the earliest and most industrialized towns of Scandinavia, but it struggled with the adaptation to post-industrialism.  Since the construction of the Øresund Bridge, Malmö has undergone a major transformation with architectural developments, and it has attracted new biotech and IT companies, and particularly students through Malmö University, founded in 1998. 

Measurement<====>19022<====>Measurement Measurement is the assignment of a number to a characteristic of an object or event, which can be compared with other objects or events.   The scope and application of a measurement is dependent on the context and discipline.  In the natural sciences and engineering, measurements do not apply to nominal properties of objects or events, which is consistent with the guidelines of the International vocabulary of metrology published by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.   However, in other fields such as statistics as well as the social and behavioral sciences, measurements can have multiple levels, which would include nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales.

Martial arts film<====>19028<====>Martial arts filmMartial arts films are a subgenre of action films, which feature numerous martial arts fights between characters.  These fights are usually the films' primary appeal and entertainment value, and often are a method of storytelling and character expression and development.  Martial arts are frequently featured in training scenes and other sequences in addition to fights.  Martial arts films commonly include other types of action, such as hand-to-hand combat, stuntwork, chases, and gunfights.    HistoryAs with other action films, martial arts films are dominated by action to varying degrees; many martial arts films have only a minimal plot and amount of character development and focus almost exclusively on the action, while other martial arts films have more creative and complex plots and characters along with action scenes. 

Musical film<====>19029<====>Musical film The musical film is a film genre in which songs sung by the characters are interwoven into the narrative, sometimes accompanied by dancing. The songs usually advance the plot or develop the film's characters, though in some cases they serve merely as breaks in the storyline, often as elaborate "production numbers". The musical film was a natural development of the stage musical after the emergence of sound film technology.  Typically, the biggest difference between film and stage musicals is the use of lavish background scenery and locations that would be impractical in a theater.  Musical films characteristically contain elements reminiscent of theater; performers often treat their song and dance numbers as if there is a live audience watching.

Mass<====>19048<====>Mass   Mass is both a property of a physical body and a measure of its resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied.   It also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies.   The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). In physics, mass is not the same as weight, even though mass is often determined by measuring the object's weight using a spring scale, rather than balance scale comparing it directly with known masses.  An object on the Moon would weigh less than it does on Earth because of the lower gravity, but it would still have the same mass.

Manganese<====>19051<====>Manganese   Manganese is a chemical element with symbol Mn and atomic number 25.  It is not found as a free element in nature; it is often found in minerals in combination with iron.  Manganese is a metal with important industrial metal alloy uses, particularly in stainless steels. Historically, manganese is named for pyrolusite and other black minerals from the region of Magnesia in Greece, which also gave its name to magnesium and the iron ore magnetite.  By the mid-18th century, Swedish-German chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele had used pyrolusite to produce chlorine.  Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite (now known to be manganese dioxide) contained a new element, but they were unable to isolate it. 

Molybdenum<====>19052<====>Molybdenum Molybdenum is a chemical element with symbol Mo and atomic number 42.  The name is from Neo-Latin molybdaenum, from Ancient Greek    , meaning lead, since its ores were confused with lead ores.Molybdenum minerals have been known throughout history, but the element was discovered (in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals) in 1778 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele.  The metal was first isolated in 1781 by Peter Jacob Hjelm. Molybdenum does not occur naturally as a free metal on Earth; it is found only in various oxidation states in minerals. 

Mineral<====>19053<====>Mineral   A mineral is a naturally occurring chemical compound,  usually of crystalline form and abiogenic in origin (not produced by life processes).  A  mineral has one specific chemical composition, whereas a rock can be an aggregate of different minerals or mineraloids.  The study of minerals is called mineralogy. There are over 5,300 known mineral species;  , over 5,290 of these had been approved by the International Mineralogical Association (IMA).The silicate minerals compose over 90% of the Earth's crust.  Silicon and oxygen constitute approximately 75% of the Earth's crust, which translates directly into the predominance of silicate minerals. 

Marble<====>19054<====>Marble   Marble is a metamorphic rock composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals, most commonly calcite or dolomite.  Marble may be foliated.

Marble is commonly used for sculpture and as a building material. EtymologyThe word "marble" derives from the Ancient Greek  ,  from  , "crystalline rock, shining stone",   perhaps from the verb  , "to flash, sparkle, gleam";  R.  S.  P.  Beekes has suggested that a "Pre-Greek origin is probable.

This compares with about 32 per square kilometre (85 per square mile) for the United States. A census (held every 10 years) was held in November 2005.Inhabited since prehistoric times, Malta was first colonized by Sicilians. Subsequently, Phoenicians, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs in 870 CE  who may have completely depopulated the islands  but in 1224 were themselves expelled from Malta,  Normans, Sicilians, Spanish, French and the British have influenced Maltese life and culture to varying degrees.Roman Catholicism is established by law as the religion of Malta with 98%; however, full liberty of conscience and freedom of worship is guaranteed, and a number of faiths have places of worship on the island (rather small groups, a combined total of 2% of the people are Protestants, Eastern Orthodox, Muslims and Jews).Malta has two official languages--Maltese (a Semitic language derived from Siculo-Arabic and heavily influenced by Sicilian and Italian), and English. Both languages are compulsory subjects in Maltese primary and secondary schools. A large portion of the population is also fluent in Italian, which was, until 1936, the national language of Malta. The literacy rate has reached 93%, compared to 63% in 1946.

In fact, the average age of the Maltese population increased from 38.5 in 2005 to 40.5 in 2011. This resulted from the increase in the number of persons aged 55 and over, together with a decrease in the number of persons under 25 years of age. The average in Gozo and Comino (41.6 years) was higher than that observed for Malta.Persons aged 65 and over more represent 16.3% of the total population in 2011, compared to 13.7% in 2005. In contrast, persons aged 14 and under make up 14.8% of the population in 2011, compared to 17.2% in 2005. Migrant background and foreign nationalityForeign nationals in MaltaAs of 2016 and 2017, the numbers of selected groups of resident foreign nationals (non-naturalized residents) in Malta were as follows:This list does not include foreigners with Maltese nationality and foreign nationals without resident status.Rank Nationality Population (2016)   Population (2017)    Total 30,000+EU nationals 22,000+  1   Italy 5,180   2   United Kingdom 3,985  3   Libya  3,622 4   Serbia  2,757 5   Philippines  2,407 6   Bulgaria 2,044  7   Russia  2,027 8   Somalia  1,845 9   Hungary 1,308  10   Syria  1,289 11   Romania 1,262   12   Spain 1,119   13   China  1,090  14   Sweden 1,085  15   Eritrea  1,057  16   Germany 991  17   Ukraine  896 18   France 879   19   India  819 20   Poland 719   21   Netherlands 466  22   Greece 379   23    Slovakia 338   24   Austria 332   25   Finland 321   26   Portugal 297   27    Czech Republic 296   28    Ireland 281   29    Latvia 276   30   Lithuania 213   31   Denmark 204   32   Belgium 188   33   Estonia 120   34   Slovenia 106   35   Croatia 100Other EU nationals 200+   Other non-EU nationals 400+  Emigration Malta has long been a country of emigration, with big Maltese communities in English-speaking countries abroad.Mass emigration picked up in the 19th century, reaching its peak in the decades after World War II. In the nineteenth century, most migration from Malta was to North Africa and the Middle East (particularly Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt), although rates of return migration to Malta were high.    Nonetheless, Maltese communities formed in these regions. By 1900, for example, British consular estimates suggest that there were 15,326 Maltese in Tunisia.   There is little trace left of the Maltese communities in North Africa, most of them having been displaced, after the rise of independence movements, to places like Marseille, the United Kingdom or Australia. After World War II, Malta's Emigration Department would assist emigrants with the cost of their travel. Between 1948 and 1967, 30 per cent of the population emigrated.  Between 1946 and the late 1970s, over 140,000 people left Malta on the assisted passage scheme, with 57.6 per cent migrating to Australia, 22 per cent to the UK, 13 per cent to Canada and 7 per cent to the United States.    (See also Maltese Australians; Maltese people in the United Kingdom)46,998 Maltese-born residents were recorded by the 2001 Australian Census, 30,178 by the 2001 UK Census, 9,525 by the 2001 Canadian Census and 9,080 by the 2000 United States Census.   Emigration dropped dramatically after the mid-1970s and has since ceased to be a social phenomenon of significance. However, since Malta joined the EU in 2004 expatriate communities emerged in a number of European countries particularly in Belgium and Luxembourg. At the same time, Malta is becoming more and more attractive for communities of immigrants, both from Western and Northern Europe (Italians, Brits) and from Eastern Europe (Serbs).ImmigrationForeign population in Malta Year Population % total 2005  12,112 3.0% 2011  20,289 4.9%  Most of the foreign community in Malta, predominantly active or retired British nationals and their dependents, is centred on Sliema and surrounding modern suburbs. Other smaller foreign groups include Italians, French, and Lebanese, many of whom have assimilated into the Maltese nation over the decades. Since the late 20th century, Malta has become a transit country for migration routes from Africa towards Europe. As a member of the European Union and of the Schengen agreement, Malta is bound by the Dublin Regulation to process all claims for asylum by those asylum seekers that enter EU territory for the first time in Malta. Irregular migrants (formal Maltese: immigranti irregolari, informal: klandestini) who land in Malta are subject to a compulsory detention policy, being held in several camps organised by the Armed Forces of Malta (AFM), including those near Ħal Far and Ħal Safi. The compulsory detention policy has been denounced by several NGOs, and in July 2010, the European Court of Human Rights found that Malta's detention of migrants was arbitrary, lacking in adequate procedures to challenge detention, and in breach of its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Very few migrants arrived in Malta in 2015, despite the fact that the rest Europe is experiencing a migrant crisis. Most migrants who were rescued between Libya and Malta were taken to Italy, and some refused to be brought to Malta.

Transport in Malta<====>19144<====>Transport in MaltaThe transport system in Malta is small but extensive, and the islands' domestic system of public transport is reliant on buses and taxis, although there were both a railway and a tramway in the past. Malta's primary international connections are the airport at Gudja and by sea mainly the Grand Harbour, and the Malta Freeport (the 3rd largest transshipment port in the Mediterranean Sea). Land transportRoads Traffic in Malta drives on the left, as in the UK.  Car ownership in Malta is exceedingly high given the very small size of the islands.  The country has the fifth-highest number of vehicles per capita in the world as of 2009, with 607 motor vehicles per 1,000 people. 

Foreign relations of Malta<====>19146<====>Foreign relations of Malta For several years after independence in 1964, under the Nationalist Party government, Malta followed a policy of close co-operation with the United Kingdom and other NATO countries.  This relationship changed with the election of the Labour Party government in June 1971, led by Dom Mintoff.  The NATO subheadquarters in Malta was closed at the request of the government, and the United States Sixth Fleet discontinued recreational visits to the country. After substantially increased financial contributions from several NATO countries (including the United States), the Royal Navy remained in the Malta Dockyard until 1979.  Following their departure, the Labour government charted a new course of neutrality and became an active member of the Non-Aligned Movement. 

Marshall Islands<====>19147<====>Marshall Islands    The Marshall Islands, officially the Republic of the Marshall Islands ( ),  is an island country located near the equator in the Pacific Ocean, slightly west of the International Date Line.  Geographically, the country is part of the larger island group of Micronesia.  The country's population of 53,158 people (at the 2011 Census ) is spread out over 29 coral atolls,    comprising 1,156 individual islands and islets. The islands share maritime boundaries with the Federated States of Micronesia to the west, Wake Island to the north,  Kiribati to the southeast, and Nauru to the south. 

Geography of the Marshall Islands<====>19149<====>Geography of the Marshall IslandsThe Marshalls consist of 29 atolls and five isolated islands, which form two parallel groups—the "Ratak" (sunrise) chain and the "Ralik" (sunset) chain.    The Marshalls share maritime boundaries with Micronesia and  Kiribati.   Two-thirds of the nation's population lives in Majuro and Ebeye.  The outer islands are sparsely populated due to lack of employment opportunities and economic development.

Demographics of the Marshall Islands<====>19150<====>Demographics of the Marshall Islands This article is about the demographic features of the population of the Marshall Islands, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population. The people of the Marshall Islands are of Micronesian origin, which is traced to a combination of peoples who emigrated from Southeast Asia in the remote past.  The matrilineal Marshallese culture revolves around a complex system of clans and lineages tied to land ownership. Virtually all Marshallese are Christian, most of them Protestant (see Religion in the Marshall Islands).  Other Christian denominations include Roman Catholicism, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Salvation Army, and Jehovah's Witness.

Foreign relations of the Marshall Islands<====>19156<====>Foreign relations of the Marshall Islands The Republic of the Marshall Islands has established bilateral diplomatic relations with over 75 other nations.    Regional cooperation, through membership in various regional and international organizations, is a key element in its foreign policy. The Marshall Islands became a member of the United Nations in September 17, 1991.  The Marshall Islands maintains embassies in the United States, Fiji, South Korea, Japan, and the Republic of China (Taiwan).  They also maintain a consulate in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA and a consulate in Springdale, Arkansas, USA. 

Mass deacidification<====>19157<====>Mass deacidificationMass deacidification is a term used in Library and Information Science for one possible measure against the degradation of paper in old books (the so-called "slow fires").  The goal of the process is to increase the pH of acidic paper on a large scale.  Although acid-free paper has become more common, a large body of acidic paper still exists in books made after the 1850s because of its cheaper and simpler production methods.  Acidic paper, especially when exposed to light, air pollution, or high relative humidity, yellows and becomes brittle over time.   During mass deacidification an alkaline agent is deposited in the paper to neutralize existing acid and prevent further decay. 

Mile<====>19159<====>Mile The mile is an English unit of length of linear measure equal to 5,280 feet, or 1,760 yards, and standardised as exactly 1,609. 344 metres by international agreement in 1959. With qualifiers, "mile" is also used to describe or translate a wide range of units derived from or roughly equivalent to the Roman mile, such as the nautical mile (now 1. 852 km exactly), the Italian mile (roughly 1. 852 km), and the Chinese mile (now 500 m exactly).  The Romans divided their mile into 5,000 feet but the greater importance of furlongs in pre-modern England meant that the statute mile was made equivalent to 8 furlongs or 5,280 feet in 1593. 

Spam (Monty Python)<====>19160<====>Spam (Monty Python)    “Spam” is a Monty Python sketch, first televised in 1970 and written by Terry Jones and Michael Palin.  In the sketch, two customers are lowered by wires into a greasy spoon café and try to order a breakfast from a menu that includes Spam in almost every dish, much to the consternation of one of the customers. The televised sketch and several subsequent performances feature Terry Jones as the Waitress, Eric Idle as Mr.  Bun and Graham Chapman as Mrs.  Bun, who does not like Spam.  The original sketch also featured John Cleese as The Hungarian and Michael Palin as a historian, but this part was left out of the audio version of the sketch recorded for the team's second album Another Monty Python Record in 1971. 

Dead Parrot sketch<====>19161<====>Dead Parrot sketch  The "Dead Parrot Sketch", alternatively and originally known as the "Pet Shop Sketch" or "Parrot Sketch", is a sketch from Monty Python's Flying Circus.  It was written by John Cleese and Graham Chapman and initially performed in the show's first series, in the eighth episode ("Full Frontal Nudity", which first aired 7 December 1969).   The sketch portrays a conflict between disgruntled customer Mr Praline (played by Cleese) and a shopkeeper (Michael Palin), who argue whether or not a recently-purchased "Norwegian Blue" parrot is dead.  It pokes fun at the many euphemisms for death used in British culture. 

Cheese Shop sketch<====>19162<====>Cheese Shop sketch The Cheese Shop is a well-known sketch from Monty Python's Flying Circus.   It originally appeared in episode 33, "Salad Days".  The script for the sketch is included in the book The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus: All the Words, Volume 2.  It was later reworked for the album The Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief and appeared for one last time during Monty Python Live (Mostly), as a surprising coda to the Dead Parrot sketch. OriginsThe idea for the sketch came after a day of shooting in Folkestone Harbour, where John Cleese became seasick and threw up repeatedly while trying to deliver a line. 

Bruces' Philosophers Song<====>19163<====>Bruces' Philosophers Song  "Bruces' Philosophers Song (Bruces' Song)" is a popular Monty Python song written and composed by Eric Idle  that was a feature of the group's stage appearances and its recordings. OriginsThe Bruces' Philosophy Song is sung by the Bruces, stereotypical "ocker" Australians of the period.  The Bruces are kitted out in khakis, slouch hats and a cork hat and are faculty members of the Philosophy Department at the fictional University of Woolamaloo.  (N. B.  there is no such place as Woolamaloo in Australia but Woolloomooloo is an inner suburb of Sydney.  There is no university there, though the real-life University of Sydney is not far away. 

The Funniest Joke in the World<====>19164<====>The Funniest Joke in the World "The Funniest Joke in the World" is the title most frequently used for written references  to a Monty Python's Flying Circus comedy sketch, which is also known by two other phrases that appear within it, "Joke Warfare" and "Killer Joke", the latter being the most commonly spoken title used to refer to it.   The premise of the sketch is that the joke is so funny that anyone who reads or hears it promptly dies from laughter. The sketch appeared in the first episode of the television show Monty Python's Flying Circus ("Whither Canada"), first shown on 5 October 1969. 

The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)<====>19165<====>The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python) "The Spanish Inquisition" is a series of sketches in Monty Python's Flying Circus, Series 2 Episode 2, first broadcast 22 September 1970, parodying the real-life Spanish Inquisition.   This episode is itself entitled "The Spanish Inquisition".   The sketches are notable for their principal catchphrase, "NO-body expects the Spanish Inquisition!" The end of the sketch uses music from the composition Devil's Galop by Charles Williams. Plot synopsisThis is a recurring sketch always predicated on an unrelated sketch in which one character mentions that they "didn't expect a Spanish Inquisition!", often in irritation at being questioned by another. 

Maya Lin<====>19166<====>Maya Lin   Maya Ying Lin (born October 5, 1959) is an American designer and artist who is known for her work in sculpture and land art.  She achieved national recognition at the age of 21 while still an undergraduate at Yale University when her design was chosen in a national competition for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D. C.It is considered one of the most influential memorials of the post-World War II period.  Lin has completed designs for other memorials, as well as for numerous public and private buildings, landscape design, and sculpture. 

Manuscript<====>19167<====>Manuscript A manuscript (abbreviated MS for singular and MSS for plural) is any document written by hand or typewritten, as opposed to being mechanically printed or reproduced in some indirect or automated way.   More recently, it is understood to be an author's written, typed, or word-processed copy of a work, as distinguished from the print of the same.   Before the arrival of printing, all documents and books were manuscripts.  Manuscripts are not defined by their contents, which may combine writing with mathematical calculations, maps, explanatory figures or illustrations.  Manuscripts may be in book form, scrolls or in codex format. 

Misogyny<====>19168<====>Misogyny   Misogyny ( ) is the hatred of, contempt for, or prejudice against women or girls.  Misogyny can be manifested in numerous ways, including social exclusion, sex discrimination, hostility, androcentrism, patriarchy, male privilege, belittling of women, violence against women, and sexual objectification.   Misogyny can occasionally be found within sacred texts of religions and mythologies, and various influential Western philosophers and thinkers have been described as misogynistic.   DefinitionsAccording to sociologist Allan G.  Johnson, "misogyny is a cultural attitude of hatred for females because they are female".  Johnson argues that: Sociologist Michael Flood at the University of Wollongong defines misogyny as the hatred of women, and notes: Dictionaries define misogyny as "hatred of women"    and as "hatred, dislike, or mistrust of women".

Agriculture accounts for about 6% of GDP and the small industrial sector for 11%.  Sugar production has declined, with most of the sugarcane now used for the production of rum.  Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to France.  The bulk of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be imported, contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual transfers of aid from France.  Tourism has become more important than agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange.  The majority of the work force is employed in the service sector and in administration.

History of Mauritania<====>19180<====>History of Mauritania The original inhabitants of Mauritania were the Bafour, presumably a Mande ethnic group, connected to the contemporary Arabized minor social group of Imraguen ("fishermen") on the Atlantic coast. The territory of Mauritania was on the fringe of geographical knowledge of Libya in classical antiquity.  Berber immigration took place from about the 3rd century.  Mauritania takes its name from the ancient Berber kingdom and later Roman province of Mauretania, and thus ultimately from the Mauri people, even though the respective territories do not overlap, historical Mauritania being considerably further north than modern Mauritania. The Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in the 7th and 8th centuries did not reach as far south, and Islam came to Mauritania only gradually, from about the 11th century, in the context of the wider Islamization of the Sudan and medieval Arab slave trade.

Politics of Mauritania<====>19183<====>Politics of Mauritania  The first fully democratic Presidential election since 1960 occurred on 11 March 2007.  The election was the final transfer from military to civilian rule following the military coup in 2005.  This was the first time the president was selected by ballot in the country's history.  The election was won by Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, who was ousted by a military coup in 2008 and replaced by general Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz. Personalities have long exercised an important influence in the politics of Mauritania - the effective exercise of political power in the country depends on control over resources; perceived ability or integrity; and tribal, ethnic, family, and personal considerations. 

Economy of Mauritania<====>19184<====>Economy of Mauritania A majority of the population of Mauritania depends on agriculture and livestock for a livelihood, even though most of the nomads and many subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s.  Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore, which account for almost 50% of total exports.  The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led to cutbacks in production.  With the current rise in metal prices, gold and copper mining companies are opening mines in the interior.  The nation's coastal waters are among the richest fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners threatens this key source of revenue.

Mean<====>19192<====>Mean   In mathematics, mean has several different definitions depending on the context. In probability and statistics, population mean and expected value are used synonymously to refer to one measure of the central tendency either of a probability distribution or of the random variable characterized by that distribution.   In the case of a discrete probability distribution of a random variable X, the mean is equal to the sum over every possible value weighted by the probability of that value; that is, it is computed by taking the product of each possible value x of X and its probability P(x), and then adding all these products together, giving  \mu = \sum x P(x) .

History of Mauritius<====>19202<====>History of Mauritius  The known history of Mauritius begins with its discovery by Arabs, followed by Europeans and its appearance on maps in the early 16th century.  Mauritius was successively colonized by the Dutch, the French and the British, and became independent in 1968. DiscoveryMauritius was first discovered by the Arabs.  This is corroborated by the earliest existing historical evidence of an island, now known as Mauritius, which is on a map produced by the Italian cartographer Alberto Cantino in 1502.    Cantino shows three islands which are thought to represent the Mascarenes (Réunion, Mauritius and Rodrigues) and calls them Dina Margabin, Dina Arobi.

Economy of Mauritius<====>19206<====>Economy of Mauritius The economy of Mauritius refers to the economic activity of the island nation of Mauritius. OverviewIn 1961, Professor James Meade painted a bleak picture of the economic prospects of Mauritius, which then had a population of 650,000.  All the disadvantages associated with smallness of island states weighed heavily in his conviction that Mauritius was caught in a Malthusian trap and, therefore, if economic progress could at all be achieved, it would be to a very limited extent.   Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has developed from a low-income, agriculturally based economy to a middle-income diversified economy with growing industrial, financial, ICT and tourist sectors. 

Telecommunications in Mauritius<====>19207<====>Telecommunications in Mauritius Telecommunications had an early beginning in Mauritius, with the first telephone line installed in 1883, seven years after the invention of the telephone.  Over the years, the network and telephony  improved.  By the late 20th century, the rapid development and convergence of information and telecommunications technologies gave rise to an ICT industry on the island along with many incentives provided by the government.  The government thus aims to make the ICT sector the 5th pillar of the Mauritian economy and Mauritius a Cyber Island.    Historically, the country is known for tourism, rather than its call centers and business process outsourcing. 

Transport in Mauritius<====>19208<====>Transport in Mauritius Transportation in Mauritius is characterized by the network of roadways, ports, and airports.  The island was originally only accessible by boat until 1922, when the first flight landed in Mauritius.    Rail transport There are currently no railways in Mauritius.  There were previously industrial railways,  but these have been abandoned.  A railway system existed from the 1860s to the 1960s.   Due to persistent unprofitability from 1948 to 1953, it was finally closed in 1964.  To cope with increasing road traffic congestion, a Light Rail Transit system has been proposed between Curepipe and Port Louis.

The position of the breakaway region of Transnistria (a self-proclaimed autonomous region, on the left side of the river Nistru), relations with Romania and with Russia, and integration into the EU dominate political discussions. The Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Moldova as "flawed democracy" in 2016. 

Economy of Moldova<====>19245<====>Economy of Moldova Moldova is a former Soviet republic in Eastern Europe.  It is landlocked, bordered by Ukraine on the east and Romania to the west.  The Republic of Moldova remains Europe's poorest nation with per capita incomes on par with Nicaragua and Ghana and half that of Albania.  Background On January 2, 1992, Moldova introduced a market economy, liberalising prices, which resulted in huge inflation.  In 1993, a national currency, the Moldovan leu, was introduced to replace the Soviet ruble.   The economic fortunes of Moldova began to change in 2001; since then the country has seen a steady annual growth of between 5% and 10%.

Primary external rail links connect the republic's network with Odessa (in Ukraine) on the Black Sea and with the Romanian cities of Iași and Galați; they also lead northward into Ukraine.  Highways link Moldova's main cities and provide the chief means of transportation within the country, but roads are in poor repair, and gasoline shortages make interurban motor transportation difficult. 

Armed Forces of the Republic of Moldova<====>19248<====>Armed Forces of the Republic of Moldova The Armed Forces of the Republic of Moldova consist of the Ground Forces and Air Defense Forces. HistoryOn 2 November 1990, prior to the formation of the state of Moldova, the Supreme Soviet of the Moldovan SSR ordered creation of the Republican Guard (Moldovan:Garda Republicană) as a militarized government agency of the SSR.  This force subsequently became the Moldovan military upon indepdence of the state.Moldova has accepted all relevant arms control obligations of the former Soviet Union.  On October 30, 1992, Moldova ratified the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, which establishes comprehensive limits on key categories of conventional military equipment and provides for the destruction of weapons in excess of those limits.

Mongolia was driven into deep recession.  Reform has been held back by the ex-communist MPRP opposition and by the political instability brought about through four successive governments under the DUC.

With almost half the population clustered in the capital of Ulaanbaatar, most landline technologies are deployed there.  Wireless technologies have had greater success in rural areas. Mobile phones are common, with provincial capitals all having 4G access.  Wireless local loop is another technology that has helped Mongolia increase accessibility to telecommunications and bypass fixed-line infrastructure.

There are rail links serving principal cities and connecting the country with Malawi, Zimbabwe and South Africa.  There are over 30,000km of roads, but much of the network is unpaved.  On the Indian Ocean coast are several large seaports, including Nacala, Beira and Maputo, with further ports being developed.  There are 3,750km of navigable inland waterways.  There is an  international airport at Maputo, 21 other paved airports, and over 100 with unpaved runways. Railways The Mozambican railway system developed over more than a century from three different ports on the Indian Ocean that serve as terminals for separate lines to the hinterland. 

Mozambique Defence Armed Forces<====>19309<====>Mozambique Defence Armed Forces   The Mozambique Defence Armed Forces (Portuguese: Forças Armadas de Defesa de Moçambique) or FADM are the national armed forces of Mozambique.  They include the General Staff of the Armed Forces and three branches of service: Army, Air Force and Navy. The FADM were formed in mid August 1994, by the integration of the People's Forces of Liberation of Mozambique (FPLM) with the military wing of RENAMO, following the end of the civil war. HistoryThe Mozambique Defence Armed Forces were formed in mid August 1994 from the previous warring factions of the Mozambique Civil War, which ended in 1992. 

Foreign relations of Mozambique<====>19310<====>Foreign relations of Mozambique  While alliances dating back to the Mozambican War of Independence remain relevant, Mozambique's foreign policy has become increasingly pragmatic.  The twin pillars of the policy are maintenance of good relations with its neighbors and maintenance and expansion of ties to development partners. During the 1970s and early 1980s, Mozambique's foreign policy was inextricably linked to the struggles for majority rule in Rhodesia and South Africa as well as superpower competition and the Cold War.  Mozambique's decision to enforce United Nations sanctions against Rhodesia and support Rhodesian guerrillas led Ian Smith's regime to undertake overt and covert actions to destabilize the country. 

Meme<====>19312<====>Meme   A meme ( ) is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture—often with the aim of conveying a particular phenomenon, theme, or meaning represented by the meme.   A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme.  Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.

Marilyn Monroe<====>19318<====>Marilyn Monroe Marilyn Monroe (born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1, 1926 – August 5, 1962) was an American actress, model and singer.  Famous for playing comic "blonde bombshell" characters, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s and was emblematic of the era's attitudes towards sexuality.  Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million by the time of her unexpected death in 1962.   More than half a century later after her death, she continues to be considered a major popular culture icon. 

Myelin<====>19319<====>Myelin Myelin is a fatty white substance that surrounds the axon of some nerve cells, forming an electrically insulating layer.  It is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system.  It is an outgrowth  of a type of glial cell. The production of the myelin sheath is called myelination or myelinogenesis.   In humans, myelination begins early in the 3rd trimester,  although little myelin exists in the brain at the time of birth.   During infancy, myelination occurs quickly, leading to a child's fast development, including crawling and walking in the first year. 

Mebyon Kernow<====>19320<====>Mebyon Kernow   Mebyon Kernow – The Party for Cornwall ( , MK; Cornish for Sons of Cornwall)   is a Cornish nationalist, centre-left political party in Cornwall, United Kingdom.  It primarily campaigns for devolution to Cornwall in the form of a Cornish Assembly, as well as social democracy and environmental protection. MK was formed as a pressure group in 1951, and contained as members activists and politicians from a number of political parties.  Its first leader was Helena Charles.  Its first election win came in 1953, with its members running as independents.  In the 1970s it became a fully-fledged political party, and since then it has fielded candidates in elections to Westminster and the European Parliament, as well as local government in Cornwall. 

Mental process<====>19321<====>Mental process  Mental process or mental function are all the things that individuals can do with their minds.  These include perception, memory, thinking (such as ideation, imagination, belief, reasoning, etc. ), volition, and emotion. Sometimes the term cognitive function is used instead. A specific instance of engaging in cognitive process is a mental event.  The event of perceiving something is different from the entire process, or capacity of perception — one's ability to perceive things.  In other words, an instance of perceiving is different from the ability that makes those instances possible.

Mesozoic<====>19322<====>Mesozoic  The Mesozoic Era (  or    ) is an interval of geological time from about  .  It is also called the Age of Reptiles, a phrase introduced by the 19th century paleontologist Gideon Mantell who viewed it as dominated by diapsids such as Iguanodon, Megalosaurus, Plesiosaurus and Pterodactylus.  This Era is also called from a paleobotanist view the Age of Conifers.  Mesozoic means "middle life", deriving from the Greek prefix meso-/μεσο- for "between" and zōon/ζῷον meaning "animal" or "living being".It is one of three geologic eras of the Phanerozoic Eon, preceded by the Paleozoic ("ancient life") and succeeded by the Cenozoic ("new life"). 

Middle East<====>19323<====>Middle East    The Middle East  ,   ;   ,  ;  ; Central Kurdish:  ,  ;  ;  ,  ;  ,  ;  ,  ;  ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ,    is a transcontinental region centered on Western Asia, Turkey (both Asian and European), and Egypt (which is mostly in North Africa).  The corresponding adjective is Middle Eastern and the derived noun is Middle Easterner.  The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term Near East (as opposed to the Far East) beginning in the early 20th century. 

Moğollar<====>19324<====>Moğollar Moğollar (Mongols in Turkish) is one of the pioneer bands in Turkish rock music for about 40 years and one of the founders of Turkish folk rock (or Anatolian rock).  The major goal of the band is to prove that folk music has a multi-layered soul and folk music's dynamism is very close to pop music's dynamism.  HistoryThe band was founded in 1967 by Neco (Nejat Tahir Özyılmazel), Aziz Azmet, Aydın Daruga and Murat Ses who were previously members of Silüetler (silhouettes).  However, Neco left the band at the end of 1967.  Also, Cahit Berkay, who was a member of Selçuk Alagöz Band, and Haluk Kunt, who was a member of Vahşi Kediler (Wild Cats), both joined the band. 

Monism<====>19325<====>Monism  Monism is the view that attributes oneness or singleness (Greek: μόνος) to a concept (e. g. , existence).  Various kinds of monism can be distinguished:Priority monism states that all existing things go back to a source that is distinct from them (e. g. , in Neoplatonism everything is derived from The One).   In this view only one thing is ontologically basic or prior to everything else. Existence monism posits that, strictly speaking, there exists only a single thing (e. g. , the universe), which can only be artificially and arbitrarily divided into many things.   Substance monism ("stuff monism") asserts that a variety of existing things can be explained in terms of a single reality or substance. 

Master shot<====>19327<====>Master shot A master shot is a film recording of an entire dramatized scene, from start to finish, from an angle that keeps all the players in view.   It is often a long shot and can sometimes perform a double function as an establishing shot.   Usually, the master shot is the first shot checked off during the shooting of a scene—it is the foundation of what is called camera coverage, other shots that reveal different aspects of the action, groupings of two or three of the actors at crucial moments, close-ups of individuals, insert shots of various props, and so on. 

Medium shot<====>19328<====>Medium shotIn film, a medium shot, mid shot (MS),    or waist shot    is a camera angle shot from a medium distance.  UseMedium shots are favored in sequences where dialogues or a small group of people are acting, as they give the viewer a partial view of the background    and also show the subjects' facial expressions in the context of their body language.Medium shots are also used when the subject in the shot is delivering information, such as news presenters.   It is also used in interviews. 

Moon<====>19331<====>MoonThe Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite.  It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary).   Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is the second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known. The Moon is thought to have formed about 4. 51 billion years ago, not long after Earth.  The most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia. 

Marco Polo<====>19334<====>Marco Polo  Marco Polo ( ;  ;   1254 January 8–9, 1324)  was an Italian  merchant, explorer, and writer, born in the Venice Republic.

Mountain range<====>19338<====>Mountain range A mountain range or hill range is a series of mountains or hills ranged in a line and connected by high ground.  A mountain system or mountain belt is a group of mountain ranges with similarity in form, structure and alignment that have arisen from the same cause, usually an orogeny.   Mountain ranges are formed by a variety of geological processes, but most of the significant ones on Earth are the result of plate tectonics.  Mountain ranges are also found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets. 

Magnoliales<====>19342<====>Magnoliales The Magnoliales comprise an order of flowering plants.ClassificationThe Magnoliales include six families:Annonaceae (custard apple family, over 2000 species of trees, shrubs, and lianas; mostly tropical but some temperate)Degeneriaceae (two species of trees found on Pacific islands)Eupomatiaceae (two species of trees and shrubs found in New Guinea and eastern Australia)Himantandraceae (two species of trees and shrubs, found in tropical areas in Southeast Asia and Australia)Magnoliaceae (about 225 species including magnolias and tulip trees)Myristicaceae (several hundred species including Nutmeg)APG systemThe APG system (1998), APG II system (2003), and APG III system (2009) place this order in the clade magnoliids, circumscribed as follows: order Magnoliales family Annonaceaefamily Degeneriaceaefamily Eupomatiaceaefamily Himantandraceaefamily Magnoliaceaefamily Myristicaceae   The current composition and phylogeny of the Magnoliales.  In these systems, published by the APG, the Magnoliales are a basal group, excluded from the eudicots.Earlier systemsThe Cronquist system (1981) placed the order in the subclass Magnoliidae of class Magnoliopsida (=dicotyledons) and used this circumscription: order Magnolialesfamily Annonaceaefamily Austrobaileyaceaefamily Canellaceaefamily Degeneriaceaefamily Eupomatiaceaefamily Himantandraceaefamily Lactoridaceaefamily Magnoliaceaefamily Myristicaceaefamily WinteraceaeThe Thorne system (1992) placed the order in superorder Magnolianae, subclass Magnoliidae (= dicotyledons), in the class Magnoliopsida (= angiosperms) and used this circumscription (including the plants placed in order Laurales and Piperales by other systems):order Magnolialesfamily Amborellaceaefamily Annonaceaefamily Aristolochiaceaefamily Austrobaileyaceaefamily Calycanthaceaefamily Canellaceaefamily Chloranthaceaefamily Degeneriaceaefamily Eupomatiaceaefamily Gomortegaceaefamily Hernandiaceaefamily Himantandraceaefamily Illiciaceaefamily Lactoridaceaefamily Lauraceaefamily Magnoliaceaefamily Monimiaceaefamily Myristicaceaefamily Piperaceaefamily Saururaceaefamily Schisandraceaefamily Trimeniaceaefamily WinteraceaeThe Engler system, in its update of 1964, placed the order in subclassis Archychlamydeae in class Dicotyledoneae (=dicotyledons) and used this circumscription: order Magnolialesfamily Amborellaceaefamily Annonaceaefamily Austrobaileyaceaefamily Calycanthaceaefamily Canellaceaefamily Cercidiphyllaceaefamily Degeneriaceaefamily Eupomatiaceaefamily Eupteleaceaefamily Gomortegaceaefamily Hernandiaceaefamily Himantandraceaefamily Illiciaceaefamily Lauraceaefamily Magnoliaceaefamily Monimiaceaefamily Myristicaceaefamily Schisandraceaefamily Trimeniaceaefamily Tetracentraceaefamily Trochodendraceaefamily WinteraceaeThe Wettstein system, latest version published in 1935, did not use this name although it had an order with a similar circumscription with the name Polycarpicae. This was placed in the Dialypetalae in subclass Choripetalae of class Dicotyledones. (See also Sympetalae).From the above it will be clear that the plants included in this order by APG have always been seen as related. They have always been placed in the order Magnoliales (or a predecessor). The difference is that earlier systems have also included other plants, which have been moved to neighbouring orders (in the magnoliids) by APG.References

Because most Mandarin dialects are found in the north, the group is sometimes referred to as the Northern dialects ( ).  Many local Mandarin varieties are not mutually intelligible.  Nevertheless, Mandarin is often placed first in lists of languages by number of native speakers (with nearly a billion). Mandarin is by far the largest of the seven or ten Chinese dialect groups, spoken by 70 percent of all Chinese speakers over a large geographical area, stretching from Yunnan in the southwest to Xinjiang in the northwest and Heilongjiang in the northeast.

Mandriva Linux<====>19368<====>Mandriva Linux  Mandriva Linux (a fusion of the French distribution Mandrakelinux or Mandrake Linux and the Brazilian distribution Conectiva Linux) was a Linux distribution by Mandriva.  It used the RPM Package Manager. Each release lifetime was 18 months for base updates (Linux, system software, etc. ) and 12 months for desktop updates (window managers, desktop environments, web browsers, etc. ).  Server products received full updates for at least 5 years after their release.    The last release of Mandriva Linux was in August 2011.  Most developers who were laid off went to Mageia.   Later on, the remaining developers teamed up with community members and formed OpenMandriva, a continuation of Mandriva. 

Matteo Carcassi<====>19369<====>Matteo CarcassiMatteo Carcassi (1792 – 16 January 1853) was a famous Italian guitarist and composer. LifeCarcassi was born in Florence, Italy, and first studied the piano, but learned guitar when still a child.  He quickly gained a reputation as a virtuoso concert guitarist. He moved to Germany in 1810, gaining almost immediate success.  In 1815, he was living in Paris, earning his living as a teacher of both the piano and the guitar.  On a concert tour in Germany in 1819, he met his friend Antoine Meissonnier for the first time.  Also a famous guitarist, Meissonnier published many of Carcassi's works in his Paris publishing house. 

Mazda<====>19370<====>Mazda , commonly referred to as simply Mazda, is a Japanese multinational automaker based in Fuchū, Aki District, Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan.  In 2015, Mazda produced 1. 5 million vehicles for global sales, the majority of which (nearly 1 million) were produced in the company's Japanese plants, with the remainder coming from a variety of other plants worldwide.   In 2015, Mazda was the fifteenth biggest automaker by production worldwide.  NameThe name Mazda came into existence with the production of the Company's first three-wheeled trucks.  Other candidates for a model name included Sumera-Go, Tenshi-Go and more. 

Minute<====>19372<====>Minute The minute is a unit of time or angle.  As a unit of time, the minute is equal to   (the first sexagesimal fraction ) of an hour, or 60 seconds.  In the UTC time standard, a minute on rare occasions has 61 seconds, a consequence of leap seconds (there is a provision to insert a negative leap second, which would result in a 59-second minute, but this has never happened in more than 40 years under this system).  As a unit of angle, the minute of arc is equal to   of a degree, or 60 seconds (of arc). 

Maurice Merleau-Ponty<====>19373<====>Maurice Merleau-Ponty Maurice Merleau-Ponty ( ; 14 March 1908 – 3 May 1961) was a French phenomenological philosopher, strongly influenced by Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger.  The constitution of meaning in human experience was his main interest and he wrote on perception, art, and politics.  He was on the editorial board of Les Temps modernes, the leftist magazine established by Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945. At the core of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy is a sustained argument for the foundational role perception plays in understanding the world as well as engaging with the world.   Like the other major phenomenologists, Merleau-Ponty expressed his philosophical insights in writings on art, literature, linguistics, and politics. 

Model organism<====>19374<====>Model organismA model organism is a non-human species that is extensively studied to understand particular biological phenomena, with the expectation that discoveries made in the organism model will provide insight into the workings of other organisms.   Model organisms are in vivo models and are widely used to research human disease when human experimentation would be unfeasible or unethical.   This strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms, and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genetic material over the course of evolution.   Studying model organisms can be informative, but care must be taken when extrapolating from one organism to another. 

Materialism<====>19376<====>Materialism Materialism is a form of philosophical monism which holds that matter is the fundamental substance in nature, and that all things, including mental aspects and consciousness, are results of material interactions. In idealism, mind and consciousness are first-order realities to which matter is subject and secondary.  In philosophical materialism the converse is true.  Here mind and consciousness are by-products or epiphenomena of material processes (the biochemistry of the human brain and nervous system, for example) without which they cannot exist.  According to this doctrine the material creates and determines consciousness, not vice versa.  Materialists believe that Matter and the physical laws that govern it constitute the most reliable guide to the nature of mind and consciousness. 

Microelectronics<====>19377<====>Microelectronics Microelectronics is a subfield of electronics.  As the name suggests, microelectronics relates to the study and manufacture (or microfabrication) of very small electronic designs and components.   Usually,  but not always, this means micrometre-scale or smaller.   These devices are typically made from semiconductor materials.  Many components of normal electronic design are available in a microelectronic equivalent.   These include transistors, capacitors, inductors, resistors, diodes and (naturally) insulators and conductors can all be found in microelectronic devices.  Unique wiring techniques such as wire bonding are also often used in microelectronics because of the unusually small size of the components, leads and pads. 

Mind<====>19378<====>Mind   The mind is a set of cognitive faculties including consciousness, perception, thinking, judgement, language and memory.   It is usually defined as the faculty of an entity's thoughts and consciousness.   It holds the power of imagination, recognition, and appreciation, and is responsible for processing feelings and emotions, resulting in attitudes and actions.  There is a lengthy tradition in philosophy, religion, psychology, and cognitive science about what constitutes a mind and what are its distinguishing properties. One open question regarding the nature of the mind is the mind–body problem, which investigates the relation of the mind to the physical brain and nervous system. 

Mahatma Gandhi<====>19379<====>Mahatma Gandhi  Mahātmā Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi ( ;    ; 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian activist who was the leader of the Indian independence movement against British rule.  Employing nonviolent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.  The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "high-souled", "venerable")   Quote: (mahā- (S.  "great, mighty, large, . . . , eminent") + ātmā (S.  "1. soul, spirit; the self, the individual; the mind, the heart; 2.  the ultimate being. 

Miyamoto Musashi<====>19381<====>Miyamoto Musashi    , also known as Shinmen Takezō, Miyamoto Bennosuke or, by his Buddhist name, Niten Dōraku,  was an expert Japanese swordsman, martial arts philosophy writer and rōnin.  Musashi, as he was often simply known, became renowned through stories of his excellent and unique double-bladed swordsmanship and undefeated record in his 60 duels (next is 33 by Itō Ittōsai).  He was the founder of the Hyōhō Niten Ichi-ryū or Niten-ryū style of swordsmanship and in his final years authored  , a book on strategy, tactics, and philosophy that is still studied today. BiographyBirthThe details of Miyamoto Musashi's early life are difficult to verify. 

Multivariate statistics<====>19384<====>Multivariate statisticsMultivariate statistics is a subdivision of statistics encompassing the simultaneous observation and analysis of more than one outcome variable.  The application of multivariate statistics is multivariate analysis. Multivariate statistics concerns understanding the different aims and background of each of the different forms of multivariate analysis, and how they relate to each other.  The practical application of multivariate statistics to a particular problem may involve several types of univariate and multivariate analyses in order to understand the relationships between variables and their relevance to the problem being studied. In addition, multivariate statistics is concerned with multivariate probability distributions, in terms of bothhow these can be used to represent the distributions of observed data;how they can be used as part of statistical inference, particularly where several different quantities are of interest to the same analysis.

He would become king 2 years later, after the death of his cousin once removed King Stephen of England. 

Money laundering<====>19390<====>Money laundering  Money laundering is the process of transforming the profits of crime and corruption into ostensibly "legitimate" assets. The dilemma of illicit activities is that it is often a problem spending the proceeds of such activities without raising the suspicion of law enforcement agencies.  Accordingly, considerable time and effort is put into devising strategies which enable the safe use of those proceeds without raising unwanted suspicion.  Such strategies are generally called money laundering.  After money has been suitably laundered or “cleaned”, it can be used in the mainstream economy for accumulation of wealth, such as acquisitions of properties, or otherwise spent. 

Midwifery<====>19391<====>Midwifery  Midwifery is the health science and health profession that deals with pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period (including care of the newborn),   besides sexual and reproductive health of women throughout their lives.   In many countries, midwifery is a medical profession (special for its independent and direct specialized education; should not be confused with the medical specialty, which depends on a previous general training).  A professional in midwifery is known as a midwife. A 2013 Cochrane review concluded that "most women should be offered midwifery-led continuity models of care and women should be encouraged to ask for this option although caution should be exercised in applying this advice to women with substantial medical or obstetric complications.

Miguel de Cervantes<====>19444<====>Miguel de Cervantes   Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra  (  or  ;   ; 29 September 1547 (assumed) 22 April 1616)  was a Spanish writer who is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the Spanish language and one of the world's pre-eminent novelists.  His masterpiece Don Quixote has been translated into more languages than any other book except the Bible. His major work, Don Quixote, sometimes considered the first modern novel,  is a classic of Western literature, regarded among the best works of fiction ever written.   His influence on the Spanish language has been so great that the language is often called la lengua de Cervantes ("the language of Cervantes"). 

Maimonides<====>19445<====>Maimonides    Rabbi Moses ben Maimon (  Mōšeh bēn-Maymōn;   Mūsā bin Maymūn), commonly known as Maimonides (   ;    Maïmōnídēs;  ), and also referred to by the acronym Rambam ( ;  , for  R abbeinu  M ōšeh  b ēn  M aimon, "Our Rabbi Moses son of Maimon"), was a medieval Sephardic Jewish philosopher who became one of the most prolific and influential Torah scholars of the Middle Ages.  In his time, he was also a preeminent astronomer and physician. Born in Córdoba, Almoravid Empire (present-day Spain) on Passover Eve, 1135 or 1138, he worked as a rabbi, physician, and philosopher in Morocco and Egypt. 

Magnetic resonance imaging<====>19446<====>Magnetic resonance imaging  Magnetic resonance imaging is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to form pictures of the anatomy and the physiological processes of the body in both health and disease.  MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, radio waves, and field gradients to generate images of the organs in the body.  MRI does not involve x-rays, which distinguishes it from CT or CAT scans.  Magnetic resonance imaging is a form of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).  NMR can also be used for imaging in other NMR applications such as NMR spectroscopy. While the hazards of x-rays are now well-controlled in most medical contexts, MRI still may be seen as superior to CT in this regard. 

Group (mathematics)<====>19447<====>Group (mathematics) In mathematics, a group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set of elements equipped with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element and that satisfies four conditions called the group axioms, namely closure, associativity, identity and invertibility.  One of the most familiar examples of a group is the set of integers together with the addition operation, but the abstract formalization of the group axioms, detached as it is from the concrete nature of any particular group and its operation, applies much more widely.   It allows entities with highly diverse mathematical origins in abstract algebra and beyond to be handled in a flexible way while retaining their essential structural aspects. 

Marilyn Manson (band)<====>19448<====>Marilyn Manson (band)Marilyn Manson is an American rock band  formed by singer Marilyn Manson and guitarist Daisy Berkowitz in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1989.  Originally named Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids, they gained a local cult following in South Florida in the early 1990s with their theatrical live performances.  In 1993, they were the first act signed to Trent Reznor's Nothing Records label.  Until 1996, the name of each member was created by combining the first name of a female sex symbol and the last name of a serial killer, for example Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson. 

Mortimer J. Adler<====>19451<====>Mortimer J.  Adler Mortimer Jerome Adler (December 28, 1902 – June 28, 2001) was an American philosopher, educator, and popular author.  As a philosopher he worked within the Aristotelian and Thomistic traditions.  He lived for long stretches in New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, and San Mateo, California.   He worked for Columbia University, the University of Chicago, Encyclopædia Britannica, and Adler's own Institute for Philosophical Research. BiographyNew York CityAdler was born in New York City on December 28, 1902, to Jewish immigrants from Germany.   He dropped out of school at age 14 to become a copy boy for the New York Sun, with the ultimate aspiration to become a journalist.

Max Weber<====>19455<====>Max WeberMaximilian Karl Emil "Max" Weber ( ; 21 April 1864 – 14 June 1920) was a German sociologist, philosopher, jurist, and political economist.  His ideas profoundly influenced social theory and social research.   Weber is often cited, with Émile Durkheim and Karl Marx, as among the three founders of sociology.  Weber was a key proponent of methodological antipositivism, arguing for the study of social action through interpretive (rather than purely empiricist) means, based on understanding the purpose and meaning that individuals attach to their own actions. 

Max Horkheimer<====>19456<====>Max Horkheimer Max Horkheimer (February 14, 1895 – July 7, 1973) was a German philosopher and sociologist who was famous for his work in critical theory as a member of the 'Frankfurt School' of social research.  Horkheimer addressed authoritarianism, militarism, economic disruption, environmental crisis, and the poverty of mass culture using the philosophy of history as a framework.  This became the foundation of critical theory.  His most important works include Eclipse of Reason (1947), Between Philosophy and Social Science (1930–1938) and, in collaboration with Theodor Adorno, Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947).  Through the Frankfurt School, Horkheimer planned, supported and made other significant works possible.

Poland Is Not Yet Lost<====>19495<====>Poland Is Not Yet Lost "Mazurek Dąbrowskiego" ( , "Dąbrowski's Mazurka") is the national anthem of Poland.The lyrics were written by Józef Wybicki in Reggio Emilia, Cisalpine Republic in Northern Italy, between 16 and 19 of July 1797, two years after the Third Partition of Poland erased the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from the map.  It was originally meant to boost the morale of Polish soldiers serving under General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski's Polish Legions that served with Napoleon's French Revolutionary Army in the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars.  "Dabrowski's Mazurka", expressing the idea that the nation of Poland, despite lack of independence, had not disappeared as long as the Polish people were still alive and fighting in its name, soon became one of the most popular patriotic songs in Poland. 

Mahjong<====>19496<====>Mahjong    Mahjong (   ,  ) is a tile-based game which has developed in China since the Qing dynasty and has further developed in numerous countries since the early 20th century.  It is commonly played by four players (with some three-player variations found in South Korea and Japan).   The game and its regional variants are widely played throughout Eastern and South Eastern Asia and have a small following in Western countries.  Similar to the Western card game rummy, Mahjong is a game of skill, strategy, and calculation and involves a degree of chance.

Mervyn Peake<====>19500<====>Mervyn Peake  Mervyn Laurence Peake (9 July 1911 – 17 November 1968) was an English writer, artist, poet, and illustrator.  He is best known for what are usually referred to as the Gormenghast books.  The three works were part of what Peake conceived as a lengthy cycle, the completion of which was prevented by his death.  They are sometimes compared to the work of his older contemporary J.  R.  R.  Tolkien, but his surreal fiction was influenced by his early love for Charles Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson rather than Tolkien's studies of mythology and philology. 

Martial arts<====>19501<====>Martial artsMartial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practices, which are practiced for a number of reasons: as self-defense, military and law enforcement applications, mental and spiritual development; as well as entertainment and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage. Although the term martial art has become associated with the fighting arts of eastern Asia, it originally referred to the combat systems of Europe as early as the 1550s.  The term is derived from Latin, and means "arts of Mars", the Roman god of war.   Some authors have argued that fighting arts or fighting systems would be more appropriate on the basis that many martial arts were never "martial" in the sense of being used or created by professional warriors. 

Murat Ses<====>19508<====>Murat SesMurat Ses (Ses means sound or voice in Turkish) (born 1946, Bayrakli, Izmir, Turkey) is a Turkish keyboard player and composer with strong Eurasian electronic elements.

Also, he founded Ağrı Dağı Efsanesi (Legend of Mount Ararat) band.  This band was dissolved in 1976 and produced 3 45 rpms. 

Finitary relation<====>19509<====>Finitary relation   In mathematics, a finitary relation has a finite number of "places".  In set theory and logic, a relation is a property that assigns truth values to  k -tuples of individuals.  Typically, the property describes a possible connection between the components of a  k -tuple.  For a given set of  k -tuples, a truth value is assigned to each  k -tuple according to whether the property does or does not hold. An example of a ternary relation (i. e. , between three individuals) is: " X  was introduced to  Y  by  Z ", where  \left(X, Y, Z\right)  is a 3-tuple of persons; for example, "Beatrice Wood was introduced to Henri-Pierre Roché by Marcel Duchamp" is true, while "Karl Marx was introduced to Friedrich Engels by Queen Victoria" is false. 

Mokele-mbembe<====>19510<====>Mokele-mbembe   Mokèlé-mbèmbé (meaning "one who stops the flow of rivers"    in the Lingala language) is a legendary water-dwelling creature of Congo River basin folklore, sometimes described as a living creature, sometimes as a spirit, and loosely analogous to the Loch Ness Monster in Western culture.  Some cryptozoologists claim it to be a sauropod.    Expeditions mounted in the hope of finding evidence of the Mokèlé-mbèmbé have failed, and the subject has been covered in a number of books and by a number of television documentaries.  According to skeptic Robert T.  Carroll, "Reports of the Mokèlé-mbèmbé have been circulating for the past two hundred years, yet no one has photographed the creature or produced any physical evidence of its existence. 

Intuitionism<====>19513<====>Intuitionism  In the philosophy of mathematics, intuitionism, or neointuitionism (opposed to preintuitionism), is an approach where mathematics is considered to be purely the result of the constructive mental activity of humans rather than the discovery of fundamental principles claimed to exist in an objective reality.  That is, logic and mathematics are not considered analytic activities wherein deep properties of objective reality are revealed and applied but are instead considered the application of internally consistent methods used to realize more complex mental constructs, regardless of their possible independent existence in an objective reality. Truth and proofThe fundamental distinguishing characteristic of intuitionism is its interpretation of what it means for a mathematical statement to be true.

Mishnah<====>19518<====>Mishnah The Mishnah or Mishna ( ;  , "study by repetition", from the verb shanah  , or "to study and review", also "secondary")  is the first major written redaction of the Jewish oral traditions known as the "Oral Torah".   It is also the first major work of Rabbinic literature. The Mishnah was redacted by Judah the Prince at the beginning of the third century CE  in a time when, according to the Talmud, the persecution of the Jews and the passage of time raised the possibility that the details of the oral traditions of the Pharisees from the Second Temple period (536 BCE – 70 CE) would be forgotten. 

Monotheism<====>19522<====>Monotheism Monotheism has been defined as the belief in the existence of only one god that created the world, is all-powerful and intervenes in the world.   Cross, F. L. ; Livingstone, E. A. , eds.  (1974).  "Monotheism".  The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (2 ed. ).  Oxford: Oxford University Press.    A broader definition of monotheism is the belief in one god. A distinction may be made between exclusive monotheism, and both inclusive monotheism and pluriform (panentheistic) monotheism which, while recognising various distinct gods, postulate some underlying unity.

Muay Thai<====>19525<====>Muay Thai  Muay Thai ( ,  ,  ) or Thai boxing  is a combat sport of Thailand that uses stand-up striking along with various clinching techniques.This physical and mental discipline which includes combat on shins is known as "the art of eight limbs" because it is characterized by the combined use of fists, elbows, knees, shins, being associated with a good physical preparation that makes a full-contact fighter very efficient.    Muay Thai became widespread internationally in the twentieth century, when practitioners defeated notable practitioners of other martial arts. 

Mao Zedong<====>19527<====>Mao Zedong    Mao Zedong  (December 26, 1893 September 9, 1976), commonly known as Chairman Mao, was a Chinese communist revolutionary, poet, political theorist and founding father of the People's Republic of China, which he ruled as the Chairman of the Communist Party of China from its establishment in 1949 until his death in 1976.  His theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as Maoism. Mao Zedong was the son of a wealthy farmer in Shaoshan, Hunan.  Mao adopted a Chinese nationalist and anti-imperialist outlook early in his life, and was particularly influenced by the events of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and May Fourth Movement of 1919. 

Mechanical engineering<====>19528<====>Mechanical engineering   Mechanical engineering is the discipline that applies engineering, physics, and materials science principles to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.   It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering disciplines. The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity.   In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), and product life cycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others.

Monkey Island (series)<====>19531<====>Monkey Island (series)    Monkey Island is the collective name given to a series of five adventure video games.  The first four games in the series were produced and published by LucasArts, formerly known as Lucasfilm Games.  The fifth installment of the franchise was developed by Telltale Games in collaboration with LucasArts.  The games follow the misadventures of the hapless Guybrush Threepwood as he struggles to become the most notorious pirate in the Caribbean, defeat the plans of the evil undead pirate LeChuck and win the heart of governess Elaine Marley.  Each game's plot usually involves the mysterious Monkey Island and its impenetrable secrets. 

Cardiff Arms Park<====>19532<====>Cardiff Arms Park    Cardiff Arms Park ( ), also known as The Arms Park and the BT Sport Cardiff Arms Park for sponsorship reasons from September 2014, is situated in the centre of Cardiff, Wales.  It is primarily known as a rugby union stadium, but it also has a bowling green.  The Arms Park was host to the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in 1958, and hosted four games in the 1991 Rugby World Cup, including the third-place play-off.  The Arms Park also hosted the inaugural Heineken Cup Final of 1995–96 and the following year in 1996–97. 

Mikhail Kalashnikov<====>19535<====>Mikhail Kalashnikov    Lieutenant-General Mikhail Timofeyevich Kalashnikov ( ; 10 November 1919 – 23 December 2013) was a Russian general, inventor, military engineer and small arms designer.  He is most famous for developing the AK-47 assault rifle and its improvements, the AKM and AK-74, as well as the PK machine gun and RPK light machine gun.  Kalashnikov was, according to himself, a self-taught tinkerer who combined innate mechanical skills with the study of weaponry to design arms that achieved battlefield ubiquity.Even though Kalashnikov felt sorrow at the weapons' uncontrolled distribution, he took pride in his inventions and in their reputation for reliability, emphasizing that his rifle is "a weapon of defense" and "not a weapon for offense". 

MUD<====>19537<====>MUD  A MUD ( ; originally Multi-User Dungeon, with later variants Multi-User Dimension and Multi-User Domain),  is a multiplayer real-time virtual world, usually text-based.   MUDs combine elements of role-playing games, hack and slash, player versus player, interactive fiction, and online chat.  Players can read or view descriptions of rooms, objects, other players, non-player characters, and actions performed in the virtual world.  Players typically interact with each other and the world by typing commands that resemble a natural language. Traditional MUDs implement a role-playing video game set in a fantasy world populated by fictional races and monsters, with players choosing classes in order to gain specific skills or powers. 

Muslim<====>19541<====>Muslim A Muslim ( ) is someone who follows or practices Islam, a monotheistic Abrahamic religion.  Muslims consider the Quran (Koran), their holy book, to be the verbatim word of God as revealed to the Islamic prophet and messenger Muhammad.  The majority of Muslims also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad (sunnah) as recorded in traditional accounts (hadith).   "Muslim" is an Arabic word meaning "one who submits (to God)".  The beliefs of Muslims include: that God (   ) is eternal, transcendent and absolutely one (tawhid or monotheism); that God is incomparable, self-sustaining and neither begets nor was begotten; that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that has been revealed before through many prophets including Abraham, Moses, Ishmael and Jesus;  that these previous messages and revelations have been partially changed or corrupted over time (tahrif)  and that the Qur'an is the final unaltered revelation from God (The Final Testament). 

MUSH<====>19542<====>MUSH   In multiplayer online games, a MUSH (a backronymed  pun on MUD most often expanded as Multi-User Shared Hallucination,  though Multi-User Shared Hack,  Habitat, and Holodeck are also observed) is a text-based online social medium to which multiple users are connected at the same time.  MUSHes are often used for online social intercourse and role-playing games,  although the first forms of MUSH do not appear to be coded specifically to implement gaming activity.   MUSH software was originally derived from MUDs; today's two major MUSH variants are descended from TinyMUD, which was fundamentally a social game. 

Microevolution<====>19544<====>Microevolution  Microevolution is the change in allele frequencies that occurs over time within a population.  Microevolution: What is microevolution?  This change is due to five different processes: mutation, selection (natural and artificial), gene flow, gene migration and genetic drift.  This change happens over a relatively short (in evolutionary terms) amount of time compared to the changes termed 'macroevolution' which is where greater differences in the population occur. Population genetics is the branch of biology that provides the mathematical structure for the study of the process of microevolution.  Ecological genetics concerns itself with observing microevolution in the wild. 

MySQL<====>19545<====>MySQL  MySQL (officially pronounced as    "My S-Q-L",   ) is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).    Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter,  and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language.  The MySQL development project has made its source code available under the terms of the GNU General Public License, as well as under a variety of proprietary agreements.  MySQL was owned and sponsored by a single for-profit firm, the Swedish company MySQL AB, now owned by Oracle Corporation.For proprietary use, several paid editions are available, and offer additional functionality. 

Modernism<====>19547<====>Modernism    Modernism is a philosophical movement that, along with cultural trends and changes, arose from wide-scale and far-reaching transformations in Western society during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Among the factors that shaped modernism were the development of modern industrial societies and the rapid growth of cities, followed then by reactions of horror to World War I.  Modernism also rejected the certainty of Enlightenment thinking, and many modernists rejected religious belief.   "[James] Joyce's Ulysses is a comedy not divine, ending, like Dante's, in the vision of a God whose will is our peace, but human all-too-human. 

Marshall McLuhan<====>19548<====>Marshall McLuhan  Herbert Marshall McLuhan,   (July 21, 1911 December 31, 1980) was a Canadian professor, philosopher, and public intellectual.  His work is one of the cornerstones of the study of media theory.   Born in Edmonton, Alberta, McLuhan studied at the University of Manitoba and the University of Cambridge.  He began his teaching career as a professor of English at several universities in the U. S.  and Canada before moving to the University of Toronto in 1946, where he remained for the rest of his life. McLuhan is known for coining the expression "the medium is the message"  and the term global village, and for predicting the World Wide Web almost 30 years before it was invented. 

Multiple inheritance<====>19550<====>Multiple inheritance Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can inherit characteristics and features from more than one parent object or parent class.  It is distinct from single inheritance, where an object or class may only inherit from one particular object or class. Multiple inheritance has been a sensitive issue for many years,   with opponents pointing to its increased complexity and ambiguity in situations such as the "diamond problem", where it may be ambiguous as to which parent class a particular feature is inherited from if more than one parent class implements said feature. 

Media studies<====>19552<====>Media studies Media studies is a discipline and field of study that deals with the content, history, and effects of various media; in particular, the mass media.  Media studies may draw on traditions from both the social sciences and the humanities, but mostly from its core disciplines of mass communication, communication, communication sciences, and communication studies.   Researchers may also develop and employ theories and methods from disciplines including cultural studies, rhetoric (including digital rhetoric), philosophy, literary theory, psychology, political science, political economy, economics,  sociology, anthropology, social theory, art history and criticism, film theory, feminist theory, and information theory. 

Microprocessor<====>19553<====>Microprocessor  A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC),    or at most a few integrated circuits.   The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, digital-integrated circuit which accepts binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output.  Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic.  Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system. The integration of a whole CPU onto a single chip or on a few chips greatly reduced the cost of processing power, increasing efficiency. 

Molecule<====>19555<====>Molecule    A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds.    Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge.  However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term molecule is often used less strictly, also being applied to polyatomic ions. In the kinetic theory of gases, the term molecule is often used for any gaseous particle regardless of its composition.  According to this definition, noble gas atoms are considered molecules as they are in fact monoatomic molecules. 

Mode (music)<====>19556<====>Mode (music) In the theory of Western music, a mode is a type of musical scale coupled with a set of characteristic melodic behaviors.  Musical modes have been a part of western musical thought since the Middle Ages, and were inspired by the theory of ancient Greek music.  The name mode is derived from the Latin word modus, "measure, standard, manner, way, size, limit of quantity, method") ( ; OED) Mode as a general conceptRegarding the concept of mode as applied to pitch relationships generally, Harold S.  Powers proposed mode as a general term but limited for melody types, which were based on the modal interpretation of ancient Greek octave species called tonos (τόνος) or harmonia (ἁρμονία), with "most of the area between . 

Mechanics<====>19559<====>Mechanics Mechanics (Greek  ) is an area of science concerned with the behaviour of physical bodies when subjected to forces or displacements, and the subsequent effects of the bodies on their environment. The scientific discipline has its origins in Ancient Greece with the writings of Aristotle and Archimedes  (see History of classical mechanics and Timeline of classical mechanics).  During the early modern period, scientists such as Galileo, Kepler, and Newton, laid the foundation for what is now known as classical mechanics. It is a branch of classical physics that deals with particles that are either at rest or are moving with velocities significantly less than the speed of light. 

Mandelbrot set<====>19562<====>Mandelbrot set  The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers  c  for which the function  f_c(z)=z^2+c  does not diverge when iterated from  z=0 , i. e. , for which the sequence  f_c(0) ,  f_c(f_c(0)) , etc. , remains bounded in absolute value.  Its definition and name are due to Adrien Douady, in tribute to the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot.  Adrien Douady and John H.  Hubbard, Etude dynamique des polynômes complexes, Prépublications mathémathiques d'Orsay 2/4 (1984 / 1985)  The set is connected to a Julia set, and related Julia sets produce similarly complex fractal shapes. 

Michael Mann<====>19565<====>Michael Mann    Michael Kenneth Mann (born February 5, 1943) is an American film director, screenwriter, and producer of film and television.  He is perhaps best known for his distinctive brand of stylized crime drama.    For his work, he has received nominations from international organizations and juries, including those at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, Cannes and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  His most acclaimed works are the crime film Heat (1995) and the docudrama The Insider (1999). Total Film ranked Mann No.  28 on its list of the 100 Greatest Directors Ever,    Sight and Sound ranked him No. 

Main-group element<====>19566<====>Main-group element In chemistry and atomic physics, the main group is the group of elements whose lightest members are represented by helium, lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine as arranged in the periodic table of the elements.  The main group includes the elements (except hydrogen, which is sometimes not included) in groups 1 and 2 (s-block), and groups 13 to 18 (p-block).  The s-block elements are primarily characterised by one main oxidation state, and the p-block elements, when they have multiple oxidation states, often have common oxidation states separated by two units. Group 12 elements are often considered to be transition metals; however, zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg) share some properties of both groups, and many scientists believe they should be included in the main group. 

Microscopy<====>19567<====>MicroscopyMicroscopy is the technical field of using microscopes to view objects and areas of objects that cannot be seen with the naked eye (objects that are not within the resolution range of the normal eye).  There are three well-known branches of microscopy: optical, electron, and scanning probe microscopy. Optical microscopy and electron microscopy involve the diffraction, reflection, or refraction of electromagnetic radiation/electron beams interacting with the specimen, and the collection of the scattered radiation or another signal in order to create an image.  This process may be carried out by wide-field irradiation of the sample (for example standard light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy) or by scanning a fine beam over the sample (for example confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy). 

Microscope<====>19568<====>Microscope A microscope (from the  , mikrós, "small" and  , skopeîn, "to look" or "see") is an instrument used to see objects that are too small to be seen by the naked eye.  Microscopy is the science of investigating small objects and structures using such an instrument.  Microscopic means invisible to the eye unless aided by a microscope. There are many types of microscopes, and they may be grouped in different ways.  One way is to describe the way the instruments interact with a sample to create images, either by sending a beam of light or electrons to a sample in its optical path, or by scanning across, and a short distance from, the surface of a sample using a probe. 

Midrash<====>19570<====>Midrash  In Judaism, the midrash ( ; "midrash".  Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary.    ; pl.) is the genre of rabbinic literature which contains early interpretations and commentaries on the Written Torah and Oral Torah (spoken law and sermons), as well as non-legalistic rabbinic literature ( ) and occasionally the Jewish religious laws ( ), which usually form a running commentary on specific passages in the Hebrew Scripture ( ).   The  , capitalized, refers to a specific compilation of these writings, primarily from the first ten centuries CE. 

Missouri<====>19571<====>Missouri Missouri is a state in the Midwestern United States.   With over six million residents, it is the 18th-most populous state of the Union.  The largest urban areas are Kansas City, St.  Louis, Springfield, and Columbia; the capital is Jefferson City, located on the Missouri River.  The state is the 21st-most extensive in area.  In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation.  The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state. Humans have inhabited the land now known as Missouri for at least 12,000 years.

Moses<====>19577<====>Moses    Moses ( )   , Modern   Tiberian   ISO 259-3  ;   Mūše;    ; was a prophet in the Abrahamic religions.  According to the Hebrew Bible, he was adopted by an Egyptian princess, and later in life became the leader of the Israelites and lawgiver, to whom the authorship of the Torah, or acquisition of the Torah from Heaven is traditionally attributed.  Also called Moshe Rabbenu in Hebrew ( , lit.  "Moses our Teacher"), he is the most important prophet in Judaism. 

Mississippi River<====>19579<====>Mississippi River    The Mississippi River is the chief river of the second-largest drainage system on the North American continent, second only to the Hudson Bay drainage system. The stream is entirely within the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), its source is in northern Minnesota and it flows generally south for    to the Mississippi River Delta in the Gulf of Mexico.  With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U. S.  states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. 

Men in black<====>19581<====>Men in black In popular culture and UFO conspiracy theories, men in black (MIB) are supposed men dressed in black suits who claim to be government agents who harass or threaten UFO witnesses to keep them quiet about what they have seen.  It is sometimes implied that they may be aliens themselves.  The term is also frequently used to describe mysterious men working for unknown organizations, as well as various branches of government allegedly designed to protect secrets or perform other strange activities.  The term is generic, used for any unusual, threatening or strangely behaved individual whose appearance on the scene can be linked in some fashion with a UFO sighting.

After his arrival at Antioch, the Jews begin a rebellion in Palestine. 558 – In Constantinople, the dome of the Hagia Sophia collapses.  Justinian I immediately orders that the dome be rebuilt. 1274 – In France, the Second Council of Lyon opens to regulate the election of the Pope. 1487 – The Siege of Málaga commences during the Spanish Reconquista. 1664 – Louis XIV of France begins construction of the Palace of Versailles. 1685 – Battle of Vrtijeljka between rebels and Ottoman forces. 

Monomer<====>19583<====>MonomerA monomer ( ) ( , "one" +  , "part") is a molecule that, as a unit,  binds chemically or supramolecularly to other molecules to form a supramolecular polymer.    Large numbers of monomer units  combine to form polymers in a process  called polymerization.  It is a small molecule of an organic substance.  A double bond exists between the individual molecules which are weak.  Molecules of a small number of monomer units (up to a few dozen) are called oligomers.  The term "monomeric protein" may also be used to describe one of the proteins making up a multiprotein complex. 

Mitochondrion<====>19588<====>Mitochondrion   The mitochondrion (plural mitochondria) is a double membrane-bound organelle found in all eukaryotic organisms.  Some cells in some multicellular organisms may however lack them (for example, mature mammalian red blood cells).  A number of unicellular organisms, such as microsporidia, parabasalids, and diplomonads, have also reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures.To date, only one eukaryote, Monocercomonoides, is known to have completely lost its mitochondria.   The word mitochondrion comes from the Greek  ,  , "thread", and  ,  , "granule"    or "grain-like". 

Minimax<====>19589<====>Minimax Minimax (sometimes MinMax or MM ) is a decision rule used in decision theory, game theory, statistics and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario.   When dealing with gains, it is referred to as "maximin"—to maximize the minimum gain.   Originally formulated for two-player zero-sum game theory, covering both the cases where players take alternate moves and those where they make simultaneous moves, it has also been extended to more complex games and to general decision-making in the presence of uncertainty. Game theoryIn general gamesThe maximin value of a player is the largest value that the player can be sure to get without knowing the actions of the other players; equivalently, it is the smallest value the other players can force the player to receive when they know the player's action. 

Minnesota<====>19590<====>Minnesota    {{Infobox U. S.  state symbols }}Minnesota ( ; locally  ) is a state in the midwestern and northern regions of the United States.  Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd U. S.  state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory.  The state has a large number of lakes, and is known by the slogan "Land of 10,000 Lakes".  Its official motto is L'Étoile du Nord (French: Star of the North).    Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 22nd most populous of the U. 

Missouri River<====>19591<====>Missouri River   The Missouri River is the longest river in North America.Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana, the Missouri flows east and south for    before entering the Mississippi River north of St.  Louis, Missouri.  The river takes drainage from a sparsely populated, semi-arid watershed of more than half a million square miles (1,300,000 km 2 ), which includes parts of ten U. S.  states and two Canadian provinces.  When combined with the lower Mississippi River, it forms the world's fourth longest river system.  For over 12,000 years, people have depended on the Missouri River and its tributaries as a source of sustenance and transportation. 

Missouria<====>19593<====>Missouria The Missouria or Missouri (in their own language, Niúachi, also spelled Niutachi) are a Native American tribe that originated in the Great Lakes region of United States before European contact.  May, John D.  "Otoe-Missouria" Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture.  2009 (5 February 2015)  The tribe belongs to the Chiwere division of the Siouan language family, together with the Iowa and Otoe. Historically, the tribe lived in bands near the mouth of the Grand River at its confluence with the Missouri River; the mouth of the Missouri at its confluence with the Mississippi River, and in present-day Saline County, Missouri. 

Missile<====>19594<====>Missile  In modern language, a missile  is a self-propelled precision-guided munition system, as opposed to an unguided self-propelled munition, referred to as a rocket (although these too can also be guided).  Missiles have four system components: targeting or missile guidance, flight system, engine, and warhead.  Missiles come in types adapted for different purposes: surface-to-surface and air-to-surface missiles (ballistic, cruise, anti-ship, anti-tank, etc. ), surface-to-air missiles (and anti-ballistic), air-to-air missiles, and anti-satellite weapons.  All known existing missiles are designed to be propelled during powered flight by chemical reactions inside a rocket engine, jet engine, or other type of engine. 

Mendelian inheritance<====>19595<====>Mendelian inheritance    Mendelian inheritance is a type of biological inheritance that follows the laws originally proposed by Gregor Mendel in 1865 and 1866 and re-discovered in 1900.  These laws were initially controversial.  When Mendel's theories were integrated with the Boveri–Sutton chromosome theory of inheritance by Thomas Hunt Morgan in 1915, they became the core of classical genetics.  Ronald Fisher combined these ideas with the theory of natural selection in his 1930 book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, putting evolution onto a mathematical footing and forming the basis for population genetics within the modern evolutionary synthesis. 

Machinima<====>19597<====>Machinima  Machinima (  or  ) is the use of real-time computer graphics engines to create a cinematic production.  Most often video games are used to generate the computer animation. Machinima-based artists, sometimes called machinimists or machinimators, are often fan laborers, by virtue of their re-use of copyrighted materials (see below).  Machinima offers to provide an archive of gaming performance and access to the look and feel of software and hardware that may already have become unavailable or even obsolete; for game studies, "Machinima’s gestures grant access to gaming’s historical conditions of possibility and how machinima offers links to a comparative horizon that informs, changes, and fully participates in videogame culture. 

Mutagenesis<====>19599<====>Mutagenesis Mutagenesis   is a process by which the genetic information of an organism is changed, resulting in a mutation.   It may occur spontaneously in nature, or as a result of exposure to mutagens.  It can also be achieved experimentally using laboratory procedures.  In nature mutagenesis can lead to cancer and various heritable diseases, but it is also a driving force of evolution.   Mutagenesis as a science was developed based on work done by Hermann Muller, Charlotte Auerbach and J.  M.  Robson in the first half of the 20th century.  BackgroundDNA may be modified, either naturally or artificially, by a number of physical, chemical and biological agents, resulting in mutations. 

Mackenzie Bowell<====>19602<====>Mackenzie Bowell  Sir Mackenzie Bowell   ( ; December 27, 1823 – December 10, 1917) was a Canadian newspaper publisher and politician, who served as the fifth Prime Minister of Canada, in office from 1894 to 1896.  Bowell was born in Rickinghall, Suffolk, England.  He and his family moved to Belleville, Ontario, in 1832.  His mother died two years after their arrival.  When in his early teens, Bowell was apprenticed to the printing shop of the local newspaper, the Belleville Intelligencer, and some 15 years later, became its owner and proprietor.  In 1867, following Confederation, he was elected to the House of Commons for the Conservative Party. 

Manhattan Project<====>19603<====>Manhattan Project    The Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking during World War II that produced the first nuclear weapons.  It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada.  From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U. S.  Army Corps of Engineers.  Nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the actual bombs.  The Army component of the project was designated the Manhattan District; "Manhattan" gradually superseded the official codename, Development of Substitute Materials, for the entire project. 

Main sequence<====>19605<====>Main sequence  In astronomy, the main sequence is a continuous and distinctive band of stars that appears on plots of stellar color versus brightness.  These color-magnitude plots are known as Hertzsprung–Russell diagrams after their co-developers, Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell.  Stars on this band are known as main-sequence stars or "dwarf" stars.    These are the most numerous true stars in the universe, and include the Earth's Sun. After condensation of mass and ignition of a star, it generates thermal energy in the dense core region through nuclear fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium. 

Memory leak<====>19609<====>Memory leak In computer science, a memory leak is a type of resource leak    that occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations  in such a way that memory which is no longer needed is not released.   In object-oriented programming, a memory leak may happen when an object is stored in memory but cannot be accessed by the running code.   A memory leak has symptoms similar to a number of other problems and generally can only be diagnosed by a programmer with access to the program's source code. A space leak occurs when a computer program uses more memory than necessary. 

Molecular orbital<====>19614<====>Molecular orbital In chemistry, a molecular orbital (MO) is a mathematical function describing the wave-like behavior of an electron in a molecule.  This function can be used to calculate chemical and physical properties such as the probability of finding an electron in any specific region.  The term orbital was introduced by Robert S.  Mulliken in 1932 as an abbreviation for one-electron orbital wave function.   At an elementary level, it is used to describe the region of space in which the function has a significant amplitude.  Molecular orbitals are usually constructed by combining atomic orbitals or  hybrid orbitals from each atom of the molecule, or other molecular orbitals from groups of atoms. 

Systems Concepts<====>19615<====>Systems Concepts Systems Concepts (now the SC Group) is a company co-founded by Stewart Nelson and Mike Levitt focused on making hardware products related to the DEC PDP-10 series of computers.   One of its major products was the SA-10, an interface which allowed PDP-10s to be connected to disk and tape drives designed for use with the channel interfaces of IBM mainframes. Later, Systems Concepts attempted to produce a compatible replacement for the DEC PDP-10 computers.   "Mars" was the code name for a family of PDP-10-compatible computers built by Systems Concepts, including the initial SC-30M, the smaller SC-25, and the slower SC-20. 

Messiah<====>19616<====>Messiah   In Abrahamic religions, the Messiah or Messias ( ;  ) is a saviour or liberator of a group of people, more specifically, the Jewish people. The concepts of Moshiach, Messianism, and of a Messianic Age originated in Judaism,   and in the Hebrew Bible; a moshiach (messiah) is a king or High Priest traditionally anointed with holy anointing oil.   However, messiahs were not exclusively Jewish, as the Hebrew Bible refers to Cyrus the Great, king of Persia, as a messiah  for his decree to rebuild the Jerusalem Temple. In Judaism, the Jewish Messiah, hamashiach (המשיח, "the Messiah", "the anointed one"),    often referred to as "King Messiah" (מלך המשיח, melekh mashiach),    is to be a human leader, physically descended from the paternal Davidic line through King David and King Solomon. 

Margaret Mead<====>19617<====>Margaret MeadMargaret Mead (December 16, 1901 – November 15, 1978) was an American cultural anthropologist who featured frequently as an author and speaker in the mass media during the 1960s and 1970s.   She earned her bachelor's degree at Barnard College in New York City and her M. A.  and Ph. D.  degrees from Columbia University. Mead was a respected and often controversial academic who popularized the insights of anthropology in modern American and Western culture.Her reports detailing the attitudes towards sex in South Pacific and Southeast Asian traditional cultures influenced the 1960s sexual revolution. 

Michael Palin<====>19620<====>Michael Palin   Michael Edward Palin   (pronounced  ; born 5 May 1943)is an English comedian, actor, writer and television presenter.   He was a member of the comedy group Monty Python and later made a number of travel documentaries. Palin wrote most of his comedic material with fellow Python member Terry Jones.  Before Monty Python, they had worked on other shows such as the Ken Dodd Show, The Frost Report, and Do Not Adjust Your Set.  Palin appeared in some of the most famous Python sketches, including "Argument Clinic", "Dead Parrot sketch", "The Lumberjack Song", "The Spanish Inquisition", "Bicycle Repair Man" and "The Fish-Slapping Dance". 

Materials science<====>19622<====>Materials scienceThe interdisciplinary field of materials science, also commonly termed materials science and engineering, involves the discovery and design of new materials, with an emphasis on solids.  The intellectual origins of materials science stem from the Enlightenment, when researchers began to use analytical thinking from chemistry, physics, and engineering to understand ancient, phenomenological observations in metallurgy and mineralogy. Materials science still incorporates elements of physics, chemistry, and engineering.  As such, the field was long considered by academic institutions as a sub-field of these related fields.  Beginning in the 1940s, materials science began to be more widely recognized as a specific and distinct field of science and engineering, and major technical universities around the world created dedicated schools of the study, within either the Science or Engineering schools, hence the naming. 

Mitsubishi A6M Zero<====>19623<====>Mitsubishi A6M Zero  The Mitsubishi A6M "Zero" is a long-range fighter aircraft manufactured by Mitsubishi Aircraft Company, a part of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy from 1940 to 1945.  The A6M was designated as the  , or the Mitsubishi A6M Rei-sen.  The A6M was usually referred to by its pilots as the "Reisen" (zero fighter), "0" being the last digit of the imperial year 2600 (1940) when it entered service with the Imperial Navy.  The official Allied reporting name was "Zeke", although the use of the name "Zero" was later adopted by the Allies as well.

Monasticism<====>19626<====>Monasticism  Monasticism (from Greek μοναχός, monachos, derived from μόνος, monos, "alone") or   is a religious way of life in which one renounces worldly pursuits to devote oneself fully to spiritual work.  Monastic life plays an important role in many Christian churches, especially in the Catholic and Orthodox traditions.  Similar forms of religious life also exist in other faiths, most notably in Buddhism, but also in Hinduism and Jainism, although the expressions differ considerably.   By contrast, in other religions monasticism is criticized and not practiced, as in Islam and Zoroastrianism, or plays a marginal role, as in Judaism.

Mathematical logic<====>19636<====>Mathematical logic  Mathematical logic is a subfield of mathematics exploring the applications of formal logic to mathematics.   It bears close connections to metamathematics, the foundations of mathematics, and theoretical computer science.    The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of formal systems and the deductive power of formal proof systems.  Mathematical logic is often divided into the fields of set theory, model theory, recursion theory, and proof theory.   These areas share basic results on logic, particularly first-order logic, and definability.  In computer science (particularly in the ACM Classification) mathematical logic encompasses additional topics not detailed in this article; see Logic in computer science for those. 

Molecular nanotechnology<====>19637<====>Molecular nanotechnology   Molecular nanotechnology (MNT) is a technology based on the ability to build structures to complex, atomic specifications by means of mechanosynthesis.   This is distinct from nanoscale materials.   Based on Richard Feynman's vision of miniature factories using nanomachines to build complex products (including additional nanomachines), this advanced form of nanotechnology (or molecular manufacturing ) would make use of positionally-controlled mechanosynthesis guided by molecular machine systems.  MNT would involve combining physical principles demonstrated by biophysics, chemistry, other nanotechnologies, and the molecular machinery of life with the systems engineering principles found in modern macroscale factories. 

Microelectromechanical systems<====>19638<====>Microelectromechanical systems Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS, also written as micro-electro-mechanical,  MicroElectroMechanical or microelectronic and microelectromechanical systems and the related micromechatronics) is the technology of microscopic devices, particularly those with moving parts.  It merges at the nano-scale into nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) and nanotechnology.  MEMS are also referred to as micromachines in Japan, or micro systems technology (MST) in Europe. MEMS are made up of components between 1 and 100 micrometres in size (i. e. , 0. 001 to 0. 1 mm), and MEMS devices generally range in size from 20 micrometres to a millimetre (i. e. , 0. 02 to 1.

Several students and young professors that were recruited or mentored by Friedman at Chicago went on to become leading economists; they include Gary Becker, Robert Fogel, Thomas Sowell,  and Robert Lucas Jr. 

Mass media<====>19641<====>Mass media  The mass media is a diversified collection of media technologies that reach a large audience via mass communication.  The technologies through which this communication takes place include a variety of outlets. Broadcast media transmit information electronically, via such media as film, radio, recorded music, or television.  Digital media comprises both Internet and mobile mass communication.  Internet media comprise such services as email, social media sites, websites, and Internet-based radio and television.  Many other mass media outlets have an additional presence on the web, by such means as linking to or running TV ads online, or distributing QR Codes in outdoor or print media to direct mobile users to a website. 

Mahabharata<====>19643<====>Mahabharata The Mahābhārata ( ,  ,  ) is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the other being the Rāmāyaṇa.    The Mahābhārata is an epic narrative of the Kurukṣetra War and the fates of the Kaurava and the Pāṇḍava princes.  It also contains philosophical and devotional material, such as  a discussion of the four "goals of life" or puruṣārtha (12. 161).  Among the principal works and stories in the Mahābhārata are the Bhagavad Gita, the story of Damayanti, an abbreviated version of the Rāmāyaṇa, and the story of Ṛṣyasringa, often considered as works in their own right. 

Mein Kampf<====>19644<====>Mein Kampf Mein Kampf ( , My Struggle) is a 1925 autobiographical book by Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler.   The work describes the process by which Hitler became antisemitic and outlines his political ideology and future plans for Germany.  Volume 1 of Mein Kampf was published in 1925 and Volume 2 in 1926.   The book was edited by Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess.   Hitler began Mein Kampf while imprisoned for what he considered to be "political crimes" following his failed Putsch in Munich in November 1923.  Although Hitler received many visitors initially, he soon devoted himself entirely to the book.

MVS<====>19649<====>MVS   Multiple Virtual Storage, more commonly called MVS, was the most commonly used operating system on the System/370 and System/390 IBM mainframe computers.  It was developed by IBM, but is unrelated to IBM's other mainframe operating systems, e. g. , VSE, VM, TPF. First released in 1974, MVS was extended by program products with new names multiple times:first to MVS/SE (MVS/System Extensions), some print media used the singular, MVS/System Extension: Computerworld, Dec 15, 1980 -Page 5; June 26, 1978 - Page 8 next to MVS/SP (MVS/System Product) Version 1, next to MVS/XA (MVS/eXtended Architecture), next to MVS/ESA (MVS/Enterprise Systems Architecture), then to OS/390 and finally to z/OS (when 64-bit support was added with the zSeries models). 

Monoid<====>19652<====>Monoid  In abstract algebra, a branch of mathematics, a monoid is an algebraic structure with a single associative binary operation and an identity element. Monoids are studied in semigroup theory, because they are semigroups with identity.  Monoids occur in several branches of mathematics; for instance, they can be regarded as categories with a single object.  Thus, they capture the idea of function composition within a set.  In fact, all functions from a set into itself form naturally a monoid with respect to function composition.  Monoids are also commonly used in computer science, both in its foundational aspects and in practical programming.

Mean value theorem<====>19662<====>Mean value theorem   In mathematics, the mean value theorem states, roughly, that for a given planar arc between two endpoints, there is at least one point at which the tangent to the arc is parallel to the secant through its endpoints. This theorem is used to prove statements about a function on an interval starting from local hypotheses about derivatives at points of the interval. More precisely, if a function  f  is continuous on the closed interval  [a,b]  , and differentiable on the open interval  (a,b)  , then there exists a point  c  in  (a,b)  such that:    f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.

MP3<====>19673<====>MP3    MP3 (formally MPEG-1 Audio Layer III or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III)  is an audio coding format for digital audio.  Originally defined as the third audio format of the MPEG-1 standard, it was retained and further extended—defining additional bit rates and support for more audio channels—as the third audio format of the subsequent MPEG-2 standard.  A third version, known as MPEG 2. 5—extended to better support lower bit rates—is commonly implemented, but is not a recognized standard.  MP3 (or mp3) as a file format commonly designates files containing an elementary stream of MPEG-1 audio and video encoded data, without other complexities of the MP3 standard.

Mary Rose<====>19679<====>Mary Rose   }   The Mary Rose is a carrack-type warship of the English Tudor navy of King Henry VIII.  After serving for 33 years in several wars against France, Scotland, and Brittany and after being substantially rebuilt in 1536, she saw her last action on   1545.  While leading the attack on the galleys of a French invasion fleet, she sank in the Solent, the straits north of the Isle of Wight. The wreck of the Mary Rose was rediscovered in 1971.  It was raised in 1982 by the Mary Rose Trust, in one of the most complex and expensive projects in the history of maritime archaeology. 

Mario Kart<====>19680<====>Mario Kartis a series of go-kart-style racing video games developed and published by Nintendo as spin-offs from its trademark Super Mario series.  The first in the series, Super Mario Kart, was launched in 1992 on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System to critical and commercial success.  There have been six Mario Kart games released for home consoles, three portable games, and four Namco co-developed arcade games, for a total of thirteen.  The latest title in the main series, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, was released on Nintendo Switch in April 2017.  The series has sold over 100 million copies worldwide to date.

Mythology<====>19685<====>Mythology  Mythology refers variously to the collected myths of a group of people  or to the study of such myths.  Myth is a feature of every culture.  Many sources for myths have been proposed, ranging from personification of nature or personification of natural phenomena, to truthful or hyperbolic accounts of historical events to explanations of existing ritual s.  A culture's collective mythology helps convey belonging, shared and religious experiences, behavioral models, and moral and practical lessons. The study of myth began in ancient history.  Rival classes of the Greek myths by Euhemerus, Plato and Sallustius were developed by the Neoplatonists and later revived by Renaissance mythographers. 

Mind map<====>19688<====>Mind map  A mind map is a  diagram used to visually organize information.  A mind map is hierarchical and shows relationships among pieces of the whole.   It is often created around a single concept, drawn as an image in the center of a blank page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images, words and parts of words are added.  Major ideas are connected directly to the central concept, and other ideas branch out from those. Mind maps can be drawn by hand, either as "rough notes" during a lecture, meeting or planning session, for example, or as higher quality pictures when more time is available. 

Machine gun<====>19690<====>Machine gun  A machine gun is a  fully automatic mounted or portable firearm designed to fire bullets in rapid succession from an ammunition belt or magazine, typically at a rate of 300 rounds per minute or higher.  Not all fully automatic firearms are machine guns.  Submachine guns, rifles, assault rifles, shotguns, pistols or cannons may be capable of fully automatic fire, but are not designed for sustained fire.  As a class of military rapid-fire guns, machine guns are fully automatic weapons designed to be used as support weapons and generally used when attached to a mount or fired from the ground on a bipod or tripod. 

Monopoly (game)<====>19692<====>Monopoly (game)Monopoly is a board game where players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game-board buying and trading properties, and develop them with houses and hotels.  Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy.  Money can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions.  The game has numerous house rules and hundreds of different editions exist, in addition to many spin-offs and related media; Monopoly has become a part of international popular culture, having been locally licensed in more than 103 countries and printed in more than thirty-seven languages. 

Max Steiner<====>19693<====>Max Steiner   Maximilian Raoul Steiner (May 10, 1888 – December 28, 1971) was an Austrian-born American music composer for theatre and films.  His father was Hungarian-Jewish Gábor Steiner born in Temesvár, Kingdom of Hungary.  He was a child prodigy who conducted his first operetta when he was twelve and became a full-time professional, either composing, arranging, or conducting, when he was fifteen. Steiner worked in England, then Broadway, and in 1929 he moved to Hollywood,  where he became one of the first composers to write music scores for films.  He was referred to as "the father of film music". 

Mercury (planet)<====>19694<====>Mercury (planet) Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System.  Its orbital period around the Sun of 88 days is the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System.  It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger to the gods. Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and never exceeds 28° away from the Sun.  When viewed from Earth, this proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western or eastern horizon during the early evening or early morning. 

Monty Python and the Holy Grail<====>19701<====>Monty Python and the Holy Grail   Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a 1975 British surreal comedy film  concerning the Arthurian legend, written and performed by the Monty Python comedy group (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin), and directed by Gilliam and Jones.    It was conceived during the hiatus between the third and fourth series of their BBC television series Monty Python's Flying Circus. In contrast to the group's first film, And Now for Something Completely Different, a compilation of sketches from the first two television series, Holy Grail draws on new material. 

Mutation<====>19702<====>Mutation   In biology, a mutation is the permanent alteration of the nucleotide sequence of the genome of an organism, virus, or extrachromosomal DNA or other genetic elements. Mutations result from errors during DNA replication or other types of damage to DNA (such as may be caused by exposure to radiation or carcinogens), which then may undergo error-prone repair (especially microhomology-mediated end joining   ), or cause an error during other forms of repair,  or else may cause an error during replication (translesion synthesis).   Mutations may also result from insertion or deletion of segments of DNA due to mobile genetic elements. 

Microgyrus<====>19705<====>Microgyrus A microgyrus is an area of the cerebral cortex that includes only four cortical layers instead of six. Microgyria are believed by some to be part of the genetic lack of prenatal development which is a cause of, or one of the causes of, dyslexia. Albert Galaburda of Harvard Medical School noticed that language centers in dyslexic brains showed microscopic flaws known as ectopias and microgyria (Galaburda et al. , 2006, Nature Neuroscience 9(10): 1213-1217).  Both affect the normal six-layer structure of the cortex.  These flaws affect connectivity and functionality of the cortex in critical areas related to sound and visual processing. 

Mercantilism<====>19708<====>Mercantilism   Mercantilism is a national economic policy that is designed to maximize the trade of a nation and, historically, to maximize the accumulation of gold and silver.   Mercantilism was dominant in modernized parts of Europe from the 16th to the 18th centuries.   before falling into decline, although some commentators argue   that it is still practised in the economies of industrializing countries, in the form of neomercantilism. It promotes governmental regulation of a nation's economy for the purpose of augmenting state power at the expense of rival national powers.  Mercantilism includes a national economic policy aimed at accumulating monetary reserves through a positive balance-of-trade, especially of finished goods. 

Meat Puppets<====>19709<====>Meat Puppets  Meat Puppets is an American rock band formed in January 1980 in Phoenix, Arizona.  The group's original lineup was Curt Kirkwood (guitar/vocals), his brother Cris Kirkwood (bass guitar/vocals), and Derrick Bostrom (drums).  The Kirkwood brothers met Bostrom while attending Brophy Prep High School in Phoenix.  The three then moved to Tempe, Arizona (a Phoenix suburb and home to Arizona State University), where the Kirkwood brothers purchased two adjacent homes, one of which had a shed in the back where they regularly practiced. Meat Puppets started as a punk rock band, but like most of their labelmates on SST Records, they established their own unique style, blending punk with country and psychedelic rock, and featuring Curt's warbling vocals.

Michael Polanyi<====>19711<====>Michael PolanyiMichael Polanyi, (11 March 1891 – 22 February 1976) was a Hungarian-British polymath, who made important theoretical contributions to physical chemistry, economics, and philosophy.  He argued that positivism supplies a false account of knowing, which if taken seriously undermines humanity's highest achievements. His wide-ranging research in physical science included chemical kinetics, x-ray diffraction, and adsorption of gases.  He pioneered the theory of fibre diffraction analysis in 1921, and the dislocation theory of plastic deformation of ductile metals and other materials in 1934.  He emigrated to Germany, in 1926 becoming a chemistry professor at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, and then in 1933 to England, becoming first a chemistry professor, and then a social sciences professor at the University of Manchester. 

Methanol<====>19712<====>Methanol   Methanol, also known as methyl alcohol among others, is a chemical with the formula CH 3 OH (often abbreviated MeOH).  Methanol acquired the name wood alcohol because it was once produced chiefly as a byproduct of the destructive distillation of wood.   Today, industrial methanol is produced in a catalytic process directly from carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. Methanol is the simplest alcohol, being only a methyl group linked to a hydroxyl group.  It is a light, volatile, colorless, flammable liquid with a distinctive odor very similar to that of ethanol (drinking alcohol). 

Milk<====>19714<====>Milk   Milk is a white liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals.  It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food.  Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases.  It contains many other nutrients  including protein and lactose. As an agricultural product, milk is extracted from non-human mammals during or soon after pregnancy.  Dairy farms produced about 730 million tonnes of milk in 2011,  from 260 million dairy cows. 

Miss Congeniality (film)<====>19715<====>Miss Congeniality (film)  Miss Congeniality is a 2000 American action comedy film directed by Donald Petrie, written by Marc Lawrence, Katie Ford, and Caryn Lucas, and starring Sandra Bullock with Michael Caine, Benjamin Bratt, William Shatner, Ernie Hudson, and Candice Bergen.  Miss Congeniality was released by Warner Bros.  Pictures on December 22, 2000 and was a box office hit grossing $212 million worldwide.  A sequel, Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous, was released in March 24, 2005 with Bullock, Shatner and Hudson reprising their roles. PlotIn 1982, a very young Gracie Hart steps into a playground fight to beat up a bully who is threatening a boy she likes. 

Magnetism<====>19716<====>Magnetism  Magnetism is a class of physical phenomena that are mediated by magnetic fields.   Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments.    The most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, producing magnetic fields themselves.   Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are iron, nickel and cobalt and their alloys.   The prefix   refers to iron, because permanent magnetism was first observed in lodestone, a form of natural iron ore called magnetite, Fe 3 O 4 . 

Filter (mathematics)<====>19719<====>Filter (mathematics)  In mathematics, a filter is a special subset of a partially ordered set.  For example, the power set of some set, partially ordered by set inclusion, is a filter.  Filters appear in order and lattice theory, but can also be found in topology whence they originate.  The dual notion of a filter is an ideal. Filters were introduced by Henri Cartan in 1937   and subsequently used by Bourbaki in their book Topologie Générale as an alternative to the similar notion of a net developed in 1922 by E.  H.  Moore and H. 

Metallurgy<====>19722<====>Metallurgy Metallurgy is a domain of materials science and engineering that studies the physical and chemical behavior of metallic elements, their inter-metallic compounds, and their mixtures, which are called alloys.  Metallurgy is also the technology of metals: the way in which science is applied to the production of metals, and the engineering of metal components for usage in products for consumers and manufacturers.  The production of metals involves the processing of ores to extract the metal they contain, and the mixture of metals, sometimes with other elements, to produce alloys.  Metallurgy is distinguished from the craft of metalworking, although metalworking relies on metallurgy, as medicine relies on medical science, for technical advancement. 

MUMPS<====>19723<====>MUMPS  MUMPS (Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System), or M, is a general-purpose computer programming language that provides ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable) transaction processing.  Its differentiating feature is its "built-in" database, enabling high-level access to disk storage using simple symbolic program variables and subscripted arrays, similar to the variables used by most languages to access main memory. The M database is a key-value database engine optimized for high-throughput transaction processing.   As such it is in the class of "schema-less", "schema-free," or NoSQL databases.   Internally, M stores data in multidimensional hierarchical sparse arrays (also known as key-value nodes, sub-trees, or associative memory). 

Mercury (programming language)<====>19726<====>Mercury (programming language)Mercury is a functional logic programming language made for real-world uses.  The first version was developed at the University of Melbourne, Computer Science department, by Fergus Henderson, Thomas Conway, and Zoltan Somogyi, under Somogyi's supervision, and released on April 8, 1995. Mercury is a purely declarative logic programming language.  It is related to both Prolog and Haskell.  The Mercury Project - Motivation  It features a strong, static, polymorphic type system, and a strong mode and determinism system. The official implementation, the Melbourne Mercury Compiler, is available for most Unix and Unix-like platforms, including Linux, macOS, and for Windows (32bits only). 

Michael Faraday<====>19727<====>Michael FaradayMichael Faraday  FRS ( ; 22 September 1791 – 25 August 1867) was an English scientist who contributed to the study of electromagnetism and electrochemistry.  His main discoveries include the principles underlying electromagnetic induction, diamagnetism and electrolysis. Although Faraday received little formal education, he was one of the most influential scientists in history.  It was by his research on the magnetic field around a conductor carrying a direct current that Faraday established the basis for the concept of the electromagnetic field in physics.  Faraday also established that magnetism could affect rays of light and that there was an underlying relationship between the two phenomena. 

Marriage<====>19728<====>Marriage   Marriage, also called matrimony or wedlock, is a socially or ritually recognised union between spouses that establishes rights and obligations between those spouses, as well as between them and any resulting biological or adopted children and affinity (in-laws and other family through marriage).   The definition of marriage varies around the world not only between cultures and between religions, but also throughout the history of any given culture and religion, evolving to both expand and constrict in who and what is encompassed, but typically it is principally an institution in which interpersonal relationships, usually sexual, are acknowledged or sanctioned. 

Midgard<====>19731<====>Midgard Midgard (an anglicised form of Old Norse  ; Old English  , Swedish and Danish Midgård, Old Saxon  , Old High German  , Gothic Midjun-gards; literally "middle yard") is the name for Earth (equivalent in meaning to the Greek term  , "inhabited") inhabited by and known to humans in early Germanic cosmology, and specifically one of the Nine Worlds in Norse mythology. Etymology  This name occurs in Old Norse literature as  .  In Old Saxon Heliand it appears as   and in Old High German poem Muspilli it appears as  . 

Mage: The Ascension<====>19732<====>Mage: The Ascension  Mage: The Ascension is a role-playing game based in the World of Darkness, and was published by White Wolf Game Studio.  The characters portrayed in the game are referred to as mages, and are capable of feats of magic.  The idea of magic in Mage is broadly inclusive of diverse ideas about mystical practices as well as other belief systems, such as science and religion, so that most mages do not resemble typical fantasy wizards. In 2005, White Wolf released a new version of the game, marketed as Mage: The Awakening, for the new World of Darkness series. 

Malcolm Fraser<====>19734<====>Malcolm Fraser   John Malcolm Fraser   ( ; 21 May 1930 – 20 March 2015) was an Australian politician who was the 22nd Prime Minister of Australia and the Leader of the Liberal Party from 1975 to 1983.  Elected to the Australian Parliament seat of Wannon in 1955 at the age of 25, Fraser was appointed to the Cabinet in 1966.  After rising to become Minister for Defence in 1969, he was regarded as a contender for the leadership of the Liberal Party following their defeat in 1972, but he lost that contest to Billy Snedden. 

Macquarie University<====>19735<====>Macquarie University    Macquarie University is a public research university based in Sydney, Australia, in the suburb of Macquarie Park.  Founded in 1964 by the New South Wales Government, it was the third university to be established in the metropolitan area of Sydney.  Established as a verdant university, Macquarie has five faculties, as well as the Macquarie University Hospital and the Macquarie Graduate School of Management, which are located on the university's main campus in suburban Sydney. The university is the first in Australia to fully align its degree system with the Bologna Accord.History20th centuryThe idea of founding a third university in Sydney was flagged in the early 1960s when the New South Wales Government formed a committee of enquiry into higher education to deal with a perceived emergency in university enrollments in New South Wales. 

Muspelheim<====>19736<====>MuspelheimIn Norse mythology, Muspelheim ( ), also called Muspell ( ), is a realm of fire.  This realm is one of the Nine Worlds, ruled by Surtr with his consort Sinmara in some accounts.  The denizens of Muspelheim were usually referred to as the Eldjötnar (or Eldthursar, Eldþursar — "fire giants") in Norse tradition, though they were also identified by other epithets in Eddic poetry, such as the Múspellssynir (or Múspellsmegir — "sons of Muspell"; altn.  Múspellmegir, Múspellsynir) and the Rjúfendr (from rjúfa — "to break, tear asunder", Destroyers of Doomsday).    Both of these terms sometimes described an entirely separate mythological species that dwelled alongside or in place of the eldjötnar within this fiery realm. 

Maxwell's equations<====>19737<====>Maxwell's equations  Maxwell's equations are a set of partial differential equations that, together with the Lorentz force law, form the foundation of classical electromagnetism, classical optics, and electric circuits.  They underpin all electric, optical and radio technologies, including power generation, electric motors, wireless communication, cameras, televisions, computers etc.  Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated by charges, currents, and changes of each other.  One important consequence of the equations is that they demonstrate how fluctuating electric and magnetic fields propagate at the speed of light.  Known as electromagnetic radiation, these waves may occur at various wavelengths to produce a spectrum from radio waves to γ-rays. 

Metrization theorem<====>19738<====>Metrization theoremIn topology and related areas of mathematics, a metrizable space is a topological space that is homeomorphic to a metric space.  That is, a topological space  (X, \mathcal{T})  is said to be metrizable if there is a metric  d\colon X \times X \to [0,\infty) such that the topology induced by d is  \mathcal{T} .    Metrization theorems are theorems that give sufficient conditions for a topological space to be metrizable. PropertiesMetrizable spaces inherit all topological properties from metric spaces.  For example, they are Hausdorff paracompact spaces (and hence normal and Tychonoff) and first-countable. 

Martin Agricola<====>19739<====>Martin AgricolaSee Agricola for several other people of the same name. Martin Agricola (6 January 1486 – 10 June 1556) was a German composer of Renaissance music and a music theorist.   BiographyAgricola was born in Schwiebus in Lebusz. From 1524 until his death he lived at Magdeburg, where he occupied the post of teacher or cantor in the Protestant school.  The senator and music-printer Georg Rhau, of Wittenberg, was a close friend of Agricola, whose theoretical works, providing valuable material concerning the change from the old to the new system of notation, he published.  Among Agricola's other theoretical works is Musica instrumentalis deudsch (1528 and 1545), a study of musical instruments, and one of the most important works in early organology; and one of the earliest books on the Rudiments of music.

Main (river)<====>19745<====>Main (river)  The Main  (  is a river in Germany.   With a length of   , it is the longest right tributary of the Rhine.  It is also the longest river lying entirely in Germany (if the Weser and the Werra are considered as two separate rivers; together they are longer).  The largest cities along the Main are Frankfurt am Main and Würzburg. GeographyThe mainspring of the Main River flows through the German states of Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg (forming the border with Bavaria for some distance) and Hesse.   Its basin competes with the Danube for water; as a result, many of its boundaries are identical with those of the European Watershed. 

Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa<====>19747<====>Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa  Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa ( ; 64/62 BC – 12 BC) was a Roman consul, statesman, general and architect. He was a close friend, son-in-law, and lieutenant to Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus and was responsible for the construction of some of the most notable buildings in the history of Rome and for important military victories, most notably at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC against the forces of Mark Antony and Cleopatra.  As a result of these victories, Octavianus became the first Roman Emperor, adopting the name of Augustus.  Agrippa assisted Augustus in making Rome 'a city of marble"  and renovating aqueducts to give all Romans, from every social class, access to the highest quality public services.

Beijing cuisine<====>19758<====>Beijing cuisine  Beijing cuisine, also known as Jing cuisine and Mandarin cuisine, and as Beiping cuisine in Taiwan, is the local cuisine of Beijing, the national capital of China.BackgroundAs Beijing has been the capital of China for centuries, its cuisine is influenced by culinary traditions from all over China, but the style that has the greatest influence on Beijing cuisine is that of the eastern coastal province of Shandong. Wang, Juling, Famous Dishes of Famous Restaurant in Beijing, Golden Shield Publishing House in Beijing, December, 2000,    Xu, Chengbei, Ancient Beijing, Customs of the General Populace of Ancient Beijing, Jiangsu Fine Arts Publishing House in Nanjing, September, 1999,    Hua Mengyang and Zhang Hongjie, Lives of the residents of Ancient Beijing, Shandong Pictorial Publishing House in Jinan, June, 2000,    Du, Fuxiang and Guo, Yunhui, Famous Restaurants in China, China Tourism Publishing House in Beijing, 1982  Beijing cuisine has itself, in turn, also greatly influenced other Chinese cuisines, particularly the cuisine of Liaoning, the Chinese imperial cuisine, and the Chinese aristocrat cuisine.    Another tradition that influenced Beijing cuisine (as well as influenced by the latter itself) is the Chinese imperial cuisine that originated from the "Emperor's Kitchen" ( ), which referred to the cooking facilities inside the Forbidden City, where thousands of cooks from different parts of China showed their best culinary skills to please the imperial family and officials. Therefore, it is sometimes difficult to determine the actual origin of a dish as the term "Mandarin" is generalised and refers not only to Beijing, but other provinces as well. However, some generalisation of Beijing cuisine can be characterised as follows: Foods that originated in Beijing are often snacks rather than main courses, and they are typically sold by small shops or street vendors. There is emphasis on dark soy paste, sesame paste, sesame oil and scallions, and fermented tofu is often served as a condiment. In terms of cooking techniques, methods relating to different ways of frying are often used.   There is less emphasis on rice as an accompaniment as compared to many other regions in China, as local rice production in Beijing is limited by the relatively dry climate.Dishes in Beijing cuisine that are served as main courses are mostly from other Chinese cuisines,  and some of the following in particular have been central to the formation of Beijing cuisine.Huaiyang cuisine has been praised since ancient times in China, and it was a general practice for an official travelling to Beijing to take up a new post to bring along with him a chef specialising in Huaiyang cuisine. When these officials had completed their terms in the capital and returned to their native provinces, most of the chefs they brought along often remained in Beijing. They opened their own restaurants or were hired by wealthy locals.   The imperial clan of the Ming dynasty, the House of Zhu, who had ancestry from Jiangsu Province, also contributed greatly in introducing Huaiyang cuisine to Beijing when the capital was moved from Nanjing to Beijing in the 15th century, because the imperial kitchen was mainly Huaiyang style. The element of traditional Beijing culinary and gastronomical cultures of enjoying artistic performances such as Beijing opera while dining directly developed from the similar practice in the culture of Jiangsu and Huaiyang cuisines.Bai, Zhongjian, Legends of Historical Business in Beijing, China Tourism Publishing House in Beijing, 1993,   Chinese Islamic cuisine is another important component of Beijing cuisine, and was first prominently introduced when Beijing became the capital of the Yuan dynasty. However, the most significant contribution to the formation of Beijing cuisine came from Shandong cuisine, as most chefs from Shandong Province came to Beijing en masse during the Qing dynasty. Unlike the earlier two cuisines, which were brought by the ruling class such as nobles, aristocrats and bureaucrats, and then spread to the general populace, the introduction of Shandong cuisine begun with serving the general populace, with much wider market segment, from wealthy merchants to the working class.HistoryThe Qing dynasty was a major period in the formation of Beijing cuisine. Before the Boxer Rebellion, the foodservice establishments in Beijing were strictly stratified by the foodservice guild. Each category of the establishment was specifically based on its ability to provide for a particular segment of the market. The top ranking foodservice establishments served nobles, aristocrats, and wealthy merchants and landlords, while lower ranking foodservice establishments served the populace of lower financial and social status. It was during this period when Beijing cuisine gained fame and became recognised by the Chinese culinary society, and the stratification of the foodservice was one of its most obvious characteristics as part of its culinary and gastronomic cultures during this first peak of its formation.    The official stratification was an integral part of the local culture of Beijing and it was not finally abolished officially after the end of the Qing dynasty, which resulted in the second peak in the formation of Beijing cuisine. Meals previously offered to nobles and aristocrats were made available to anyone who could afford them instead of being restricted only to the upper class. As chefs freely switched between jobs offered by different foodservice establishments, they brought their skills that further enriched and developed Beijing cuisine. Though the stratification of food services in Beijing was no longer effected by imperial laws, the structure more or less remained despite continuous weakening due to the financial background of the local clientele. The different classes are listed in the following subsections.ZhuangFoodservice establishments with names ending with the Chinese character zhuang ( ), or zhuang zihao ( ), were the top-ranking foodservice establishments, not only in providing foods, but entertainment as well. The form of entertainment provided was usually Beijing opera, and foodservice establishments of this class always had long-term contracts with a Beijing opera troupe to perform onsite. Moreover, foodservice establishments of this class would always have long-term contracts with famous performers, such as national-treasure-class performers, to perform onsite, though not on a daily basis. Foodservice establishments of this category did not accept any different customers on a walk-in basis, but instead, only accepted customers who came as a group and ordered banquets by appointment, and the banquets provided by foodservice establishments of this category often included most, if not all tables, at the site. The bulk of the business of foodservice of this category, however, was catering at customers' homes or other locations, and such catering was often for birthdays, marriages, funerals, promotions and other important celebrations and festivals. When catering, these foodservice establishments not only provided what was on the menu, but fulfilled customers' requests.Foodservice establishments categorised as leng zhuangzi ( ) lacked any rooms to host banquets, and thus their business was purely catering.TangFoodservice establishments with names ending with the Chinese character tang ( ), or tang zihao ( ), are similar to foodservice establishments with names ending with the Chinese character zhuang, but the business of these second-class foodservice establishments were generally evenly divided among onsite banquet hosting and catering (at customers' homes). Foodservice establishments of this class would also have long-term contracts with Beijing opera troupes to perform onsite, but they did not have long-term contracts with famous performers, such as national-treasure-class performers, to perform onsite on regular basis; however these top performers would still perform at foodservice establishments of this category occasionally. In terms of catering at the customers' sites, foodservice establishments of this category often only provided dishes strictly according to their menu, and would not provide any dishes that were not on the menu.TingFoodservice establishments with names ending with the Chinese character ting ( ), or ting zihao ( ) are foodservice establishments which had more business in onsite banquet hosting than catering at customers' homes. For onsite banquet hosting, entertainment was still provided, but foodservice establishments of this category did not have long-term contracts with Beijing opera troupes, so that performers varied from time to time, and top performers usually did not perform here or at any lower-ranking foodservice establishments. For catering, different foodservice establishments of this category were incapable of handling significant catering on their own, but generally had to combine resources with other foodservice establishments of the same ranking (or lower) to do the job.YuanFoodservice establishments with names ending with the Chinese character yuan ( ), or yuan zihao ( ) did nearly all their business in hosting banquets onsite. Entertainment was not provided on a regular basis, but there were stages built onsite for Beijing opera performers. Instead of being hired by the foodservice establishments like in the previous three categories, performers at foodservice establishments of this category were usually contractors who paid the foodservice establishment to perform and split the earnings according to a certain percentage. Occasionally, foodservice establishments of this category would be called upon to help cater at customers' homes, and like foodservice establishments with names ending with the Chinese character ting, they could not do the job on their own but had to work with others, never taking the lead as foodservice establishments with names ending with the Chinese character ting could.LouFoodservice establishments with names ending with the Chinese character lou ( ), or lou zihao ( ) did the bulk of their business hosting banquets onsite by appointment. In addition, a smaller portion of the business was in serving different customers onsite on a walk-in basis. Occasionally, when catering at customers' homes, foodservice establishments of this category would only provide the few specialty dishes they were famous for.JuFoodservice establishments with names ending with the Chinese character ju ( ), or ju zihao ( ) generally divided their business evenly into two areas: serving different customers onsite on a walk-in basis, and hosting banquets by appointment for customers who came as one group. Occasionally, when catering at the customers' homes, foodservice establishments of this category would only provide the few specialty dishes they were famous for, just like foodservice establishments with names ending with the Chinese character lou. However, unlike those establishments, which always cooked their specialty dishes on location, foodservice establishment of this category would either cook on location or simply bring the already-cooked food to the location.ZhaiFoodservice establishments with names ending with the Chinese character zhai ( ), or zhai zihao ( ) were mainly in the business of serving different customers onsite on a walk-in basis, but a small portion of their income did come from hosting banquets by appointment for customers who came as one group. Just like foodservice establishments with names ending with the Chinese character ju, when catering at customers’ homes, foodservice establishments of this category would also only provide the few specialty dishes they are famous for, but they would mostly bring the already-cooked dishes to the location, and would only cook on location occasionally.FangFoodservice establishments with names ending with the Chinese character fang ( ), or fang zihao ( ). Foodservice establishments of this category generally did not offer the service of hosting banquets made by appointment for customers who came as one group, but instead, often only offered to serve different customers onsite on a walk-in basis. Foodservice establishments of this category or lower would not be called upon to perform catering at the customers' homes for special events.GuanFoodservice establishments with names ending with the Chinese character guan ( ), or guan zihao ( ). Foodservice establishments of this category mainly served different customers onsite on a walk-in basis, and in addition, a portion of the income would be earned from selling to-goes.DianFoodservice establishments with names ending with the Chinese character dian ( ), or dian zihao ( ). Foodservice establishments of this category had their own place, like all previous categories, but serving different customers to dine onsite on a walk-in basis only provided half of the overall income, while the other half came from selling to-goes.PuFoodservice establishments with name ending with the Chinese character pu ( ), or pu zihao ( ). Foodservice establishments of this category ranked next to the last, and they were often named after the owners' last names. Foodservice establishments of this category had fixed spots of business for having their own places, but not as large as those belonging to the category of dian, and thus did not have tables, but only seats for customers. As a result, the bulk of the income of foodservice establishments of this category was from selling to-goes, while income earned from customers dining onsite only provided a small portion of the overall income.TanFoodservice establishments with names ending with the Chinese character tan ( ), or tan zihao ( ). The lowest ranking foodservice establishments without any tables, and selling to-goes was the only form of business. In addition to name the food stand after the owners' last name or the food sold, these food stands were also often named after the owners' nicknames.Notable dishes and street foodsMeat and poultry dishesEnglish  Traditional Chinese  Simplified Chinese  Pinyin  Notes Beef wrapped in pancake  Beggar's Chicken The dish's name literally means "rich chicken" or "wealthy chicken".

Manichaeism<====>19760<====>Manichaeism   Manichaeism ( ; in Modern Persian   Āyin-e Māni;  ) was a major religious movement that was founded by the Iranian  prophet Mani (in Persian: مانی, Syriac:  ܡܐܢܝ , Latin: Manichaeus or Manes;   216–276 AD) in the Sasanian Empire.   Manichaeism taught an elaborate dualistic cosmology describing the struggle between a good, spiritual world of light, and an evil, material world of darkness.  Through an ongoing process that takes place in human history, light is gradually removed from the world of matter and returned to the world of light, whence it came. 

Moroccan cuisine<====>19761<====>Moroccan cuisine Moroccan cuisine is influenced by Morocco's interactions and exchanges with other cultures and nations over the centuries.   Moroccan cuisine is typically a mix of Arabic, Andalusian, Berber and Mediterranean cuisines with a slight European and Subsaharan influence. IngredientsMorocco produces a large range of Mediterranean fruits and vegetables and even some tropical ones.  Common meats include beef, goat, mutton and lamb, chicken and seafood, which serve as a base for the cuisine.  Characteristic flavorings include lemon pickle, argan oil, cold-pressed, unrefined olive oil and dried fruits.As in Mediterranean cuisine in general, the staple ingredients include wheat, used for bread and couscous, and olive oil; the third Mediterranean staple, the grape, is eaten as a dessert, though a certain amount of wine is made in the country.

Mariculture<====>19769<====>MaricultureMariculture is a specialized branch of aquaculture involving the cultivation of marine organisms for food and other products in the open ocean, an enclosed section of the ocean, or in tanks, ponds or raceways which are filled with seawater.  An example of the latter is the farming of marine fish, including finfish and shellfish like prawns, or oysters and seaweed in saltwater ponds.  Non-food products produced by mariculture include: fish meal, nutrient agar, jewellery (e. g.  cultured pearls), and cosmetics. MethodsAlgae ShellfishSimilar to algae cultivation, shellfish can be farmed in multiple ways: on ropes, in bags or cages, or directly on (or within) the intertidal substrate. 

Memetics<====>19770<====>Memetics Memetics is the study of information and culture based on an analogy with Darwinian evolution.  Proponents describe memetics as an approach to evolutionary models of cultural information transfer.  Critics regard memetics as a pseudoscience.  Memetics involves sidestepping the traditional concern with the truth of ideas and beliefs and instead involving a focus on the success of ideas and beliefs.  Kantorovich, Aharon (2013) An Evolutionary View of Science: Imitation and Memetics.  The term meme was coined in Richard Dawkins' 1976 book The Selfish Gene, but Dawkins later distanced himself from the resulting field of study.

Murray River<====>19811<====>Murray River    The Murray River (or River Murray In South Australia, the rendition "River Murray" is the most common, as is "River Darling" and "River Torrens".  ) (Ngarrindjeri: Millewa, Yorta Yorta: Tongala)  is Australia's longest river, at   in length.   The Murray rises in the Australian Alps, draining the western side of Australia's highest mountains, and then meanders across Australia's inland plains, forming the border between the states of New South Wales and Victoria as it flows to the northwest into South Australia.  It turns south at Morgan for its final  , reaching the ocean at Lake Alexandrina. 

Project Mercury<====>19812<====>Project Mercury    Project Mercury was the first human spaceflight program of the United States, running from 1958 through 1963.   An early highlight of the Space Race, its goal was to put a man into Earth orbit and return him safely, ideally before the Soviet Union.  Taken over from the U. S.  Air Force by the newly created civilian space agency NASA, it conducted twenty unmanned developmental flights (some using animals), and six successful flights by astronauts.  The program, which took its name from Roman mythology, cost $277 million in 1965 US dollars, and involved the work of 2 million people. 

Gaius Maecenas<====>19813<====>Gaius MaecenasGaius Cilnius Maecenas ( ; 15 April 68 BC – 8 BC) was an ally, friend and political advisor to Octavian (who was to become the first Emperor of Rome as Caesar Augustus) as well as an important patron for the new generation of Augustan poets, including both Horace and Virgil.  During the reign of Augustus, Maecenas served as a quasi-culture minister to the Emperor but in spite of his wealth and power he chose not to enter the Senate, remaining of equestrian rank. His name has become a byword for a wealthy, generous and enlightened patron of the arts.

Magick (Thelema)<====>19820<====>Magick (Thelema)  Magick, in the context of Aleister Crowley's Thelema, is a term used to show and differentiate the occult from performance magic and is defined as "the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will", including both "mundane" acts of will as well as ritual magic.  Crowley wrote that "it is theoretically possible to cause in any object any change of which that object is capable by nature".   John Symonds and Kenneth Grant attach a deeper occult significance to this preference.  Crowley saw Magick as the essential method for a person to reach true understanding of the self and to act according to one's true will, which he saw as the reconciliation "between freewill and destiny. 

Tacitus (emperor)<====>19821<====>Tacitus (emperor)  Tacitus ( ;  ;  Jones, pg.  873  c.  200 – June 276), was Roman Emperor from 275 to 276.  During his short reign he campaigned against the Goths and the Heruli, for which he received the title Gothicus Maximus. Early lifeTacitus was born in Interamna (Terni), in Italia.   He circulated copies of the historian Gaius Cornelius Tacitus' work, which was barely read at the time, perhaps contributing to the partial survival of the historian's work; however, modern historiography  rejects his claimed descent from the historian as a fabrication.

Maya numerals<====>19823<====>Maya numerals The Mayan numeral system is a vigesimal (base-20) positional notation used in the Maya civilization to represent numbers.  The numerals are made up of three symbols; zero (shell shape, with the plastron uppermost), one (a dot) and five (a bar).   For example, thirteen is written as three dots in a horizontal row above two horizontal lines stacked above each other. With only three numbers they could do every single number 400s 20s  1s   33 429 5125  Numbers after 19 were written  vertically in powers of twenty. 

Michael Foot<====>19826<====>Michael Foot   Michael Mackintosh Foot   (23 July 1913 – 3 March 2010) was a British Labour Party politician and man of letters.

Max and Moritz<====>19828<====>Max and Moritz  Max and Moritz (A Story of Seven Boyish Pranks) (original: Max und Moritz – Eine Bubengeschichte in sieben Streichen) is a German language illustrated story in verse.  This highly inventive, blackly humorous tale, told entirely in rhymed couplets, was written and illustrated by Wilhelm Busch and published in 1865.  It is among the early works of Busch, nevertheless it already features many substantial, effectually aesthetic and formal regularities, procedures and basic patterns of Busch's later works.   Many familiar with comic strip history consider it to have been the direct inspiration for the Katzenjammer Kids and Quick & Flupke. 

May Day<====>19829<====>May Day    May Day is a public holiday usually celebrated on May 1.  It is an ancient northern hemisphere spring festival.   It is also a traditional spring holiday in many cultures.  Dances, singing, and cake are usually part of the celebrations that the day includes. In the late 19th century, May Day was chosen as the date for International Workers' Day by the Socialists and Communists of the Second International to commemorate the Haymarket affair in Chicago.International Workers' Day may also be referred to as "May Day", but it is a different celebration from the traditional May Day. 

Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution<====>19830<====>Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution  In Physics (in particular in statistical mechanics), the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution is a particular probability distribution named after James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann.  It was first defined and used for describing particle speeds in idealized gases where the particles move freely inside a stationary container without interacting with one another, except for very brief collisions in which they exchange energy and momentum with each other or with their thermal environment.  Particle in this context refers to gaseous particles (atoms or molecules), and the system of particles is assumed to have reached thermodynamic equilibrium.  Statistical Physics (2nd Edition), F. 

Margaret Thatcher<====>19831<====>Margaret ThatcherMargaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher    ( ; 13 October 1925 8 April 2013) was a British   who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 and Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990.  She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and the first woman to have been appointed.  A Soviet journalist dubbed her the "Iron Lady", a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style. 

Metastability<====>19833<====>Metastability In physics, metastability is a stable state of a dynamical system other than the system's state of least energy. A ball resting in a hollow on a slope is a simple example of metastability.  If the ball is only slightly pushed, it will settle back into its hollow, but a stronger push may start the ball rolling down the slope.  Bowling pins show similar metastability by either merely wobbling for a moment or tipping over completely.  A common example of metastability in science is isomerisation.  Higher energy isomers are long lived as they are prevented from rearranging to their preferred ground state by (possibly large) barriers in the potential energy. 

Mary Wollstonecraft<====>19834<====>Mary WollstonecraftMary Wollstonecraft ( ; 27 April 1759 – 10 September 1797) was an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of women's rights.  During her brief career, she wrote novels, treatises, a travel narrative, a history of the French Revolution, a conduct book, and a children's book.  Wollstonecraft is best known for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), in which she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education.  She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a social order founded on reason. 

Molecular mass<====>19836<====>Molecular mass Molecular mass or molecular weight is the mass of a molecule.  It is calculated as the sum of the atomic weights of each constituent element multiplied by the number of atoms of that element in the molecular formula.  The molecular mass of small to medium size molecules, measured by mass spectrometry, determines stoichiometry.  For large molecules such as proteins, methods based on viscosity and light-scattering can be used to determine molecular mass when crystallographic data are not available. DefinitionsBoth atomic and molecular masses are usually obtained relative to the mass of the isotope  12 C (carbon 12), which by definition    is equal to 12. 

Metallic bonding<====>19838<====>Metallic bonding  Metallic bonding is a type of chemical bonding that arises from the electrostatic attractive force between conduction electrons (in the form of an electron cloud of delocalized electrons) and positively charged metal ions.  It may be described as the sharing of free electrons among a lattice of positively charged ions (cations).  Metallic bonding accounts for many physical properties of metals, such as strength, ductility, thermal and electrical resistivity and conductivity, opacity, and luster.Metallic bonding is not the only type of chemical bonding a metal can exhibit, even as a pure substance. 

Methyl group<====>19839<====>Methyl group A methyl group is an alkyl derived from methane, containing one carbon atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms — CH 3 .  In formulas, the group is often abbreviated Me.  Such hydrocarbon groups occur in many organic compounds.  It is a very stable group in most molecules.   While the methyl group is usually part of a larger molecule, it can be found on its own in any of three forms: anion, cation or radical.  The anion has eight valence electrons, the radical seven and the cation six.  All three forms are highly reactive and rarely observed. 

Mild ale<====>19842<====>Mild aleThe term "mild" originally meant young beer or ale, as opposed to "stale" aged beer or ale with its resulting "tang".  In more recent times, it has been interpreted as having a low gravity or being "mildly hopped". This style of beer originated in Britain in the 17th century or earlier has a predominantly malty palate.  Modern mild ales are mainly dark coloured with an alcohol by volume (ABV) of 3% to 3. 6%, although there are lighter hued examples as well as stronger examples reaching 6% abv and higher. Light mild is generally similar, but pale in colour, for instance Harveys Brewery Knots of May. 

Mars Society<====>19843<====>Mars Society  The Mars Society is an American worldwide volunteer-driven space-advocacy non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the human exploration and settlement of the planet Mars.  Inspired by "The Case for Mars" conferences which were hosted by The Mars Underground at the University of Colorado Boulder, the Mars Society was established by Dr.  Robert Zubrin and others in 1998 with the goal of educating the public, the media and government on the benefits of exploring Mars, the importance of planning for a humans-to-Mars mission in the coming decades and the need to create a permanent human presence on the Red Planet. 

Minerva<====>19845<====>Minerva    Minerva ( ;  ; Etruscan: Menrva) was the Roman goddess of wisdom and strategic warfare, though it is noted that the Romans did not stress her relation to battle and warfare as the Greeks would come to, and the sponsor of arts, trade, and strategy.  From the second century BC onward, the Romans equated her with the Greek goddess Athena.  Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia, Book People, Haydock, 1995, p.  215.   Following the Greek myths around Athena, she was born of Metis, who had been swallowed by Jupiter, and burst from her father's head, fully armed and clad in armor. 

Mars Direct<====>19846<====>Mars DirectMars Direct is a proposal for a human mission to Mars which purports to be both cost-effective and possible with current technology.  It was originally detailed in a research paper by Martin Marietta engineers Robert Zubrin and David Baker in 1990, and later expanded upon in Zubrin's 1996 book The Case for Mars.  It now serves as a staple of Zubrin's speaking engagements and general advocacy as head of the Mars Society, an organization devoted to the colonization of Mars.  HistorySpace Exploration InitiativeOn July 20, 1989, George H.  W.  Bush – then President of the United States – announced plans for what came to be known as the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI). 

Max Planck<====>19848<====>Max PlanckMax Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck, FRS    ( ;  23 April 1858 – 4 October 1947) was a German theoretical physicist whose discovery of energy quanta won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918.  Planck made many contributions to theoretical physics, but his fame as a physicist rests primarily on his role as the originator of quantum theory, which revolutionized human understanding of atomic and subatomic processes.  In 1948 the German scientific institution the Kaiser Wilhelm Society  (of which Planck was twice president), was renamed the Max Planck Society (MPS).

Mars Attacks<====>19855<====>Mars Attacks  Mars Attacks is a science fiction themed trading card series released in 1962.  The cards feature artwork by science-fiction artists Wally Wood and Norman Saunders. The cards form a story arc, which tell of the invasion of Earth by cruel, hideous Martians, under the command of a corrupt Martian government who conceal the fact from the Martian populace that Mars is doomed to explode and therefore proposes a colonization of Earth.  The cards depict futuristic battle scenes and bizarre methods of Martian attack, torture and slaughter, as well as various Earth nations being attacked.  The story concludes with an expeditionary force of humans volunteering to embark on a counterattack on Mars, in which the Earth force attacks the Martians in their manner (bayoneting and bullets) This necessitates the Martian invasion troops to be recalled to defend their homeworld. 

Montreal Protocol<====>19856<====>Montreal Protocol   The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (a protocol to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer) is an international treaty designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of numerous substances that are responsible for ozone depletion.  It was agreed on 16 September 1987, and entered into force on 1 January 1989, followed by a first meeting in Helsinki, May 1989.  Since then, it has undergone eight revisions, in 1990 (London), 1991 (Nairobi), 1992 (Copenhagen), 1993 (Bangkok), 1995 (Vienna), 1997 (Montreal), 1998 (Australia), 1999 (Beijing) and 2016 (Kigali, adopted, but not in force).

Situated in the Petitcodiac River Valley, Moncton lies at the geographic centre of the Maritime Provinces.  The city has earned the nickname "Hub City" due to its central inland location in the region and its history as a railway and land transportation hub for the Maritimes. The city proper has a population of 71,889 (2016) and has a land area of  .  The Moncton CMA has a population of 144,810 (2016), making it the largest city  and CMA in New Brunswick, and the second-largest city and CMA in the Maritime Provinces. 

Model theory<====>19858<====>Model theory In mathematics, model theory is the study of classes of mathematical structures (e. g.  groups, fields, graphs, universes of set theory) from the perspective of mathematical logic.  The objects of study are models of theories in a formal language.  A set of sentences in a formal language is called a theory;  a model of a theory is a structure (e. g.  an interpretation) that satisfies the sentences of that theory. Model theory recognises and is intimately concerned with a duality: it examines semantical elements (meaning and truth) by means of syntactical elements (formulas and proofs) of a corresponding language. 

Moby-Dick<====>19859<====>Moby-Dick   Moby-Dick; or, The Whale is a novel by American writer Herman Melville, published in 1851 during the period of the American Renaissance.  Sailor Ishmael tells the story of the obsessive quest of Ahab, captain of the whaler Pequod, for revenge on Moby Dick, the white whale that on the previous whaling voyage bit off Ahab's leg at the knee.  The novel was a commercial failure and out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891, but during the 20th century, its reputation as a Great American Novel was established.  William Faulkner confessed he wished he had written it himself,  and D. 

Madeira River<====>19863<====>Madeira River The Madeira River ( ,  ) is a major waterway in South America, approximately   long.   The Madeira is one of the biggest tributaries of the Amazon, accounting for about 15% of the water in the basin.   A map from Emanuel Bowen in 1747, held by the David Rumsey Map Collection, refers to the Madeira by the pre-colonial, indigenous name Cuyari:   The River of Cuyari, called by the Portuguese Madeira or the Wood River, is formed by two great rivers, which join near its mouth.  It was by this River, that the Nation of Topinambes passed into the River Amazon. 

Marañón River<====>19864<====>Marañón River  The Marañón River ( ,  ) is the principal or mainstem source of the Amazon River, arising about 160 km to the northeast of Lima, Peru, and flowing through a deeply eroded Andean valley in a northwesterly direction, along the eastern base of the Cordillera of the Andes, as far as 5° 36′ southern latitude; from where it makes a great bend to the northeast, and cuts through the jungle Andes, until at the Pongo de Manseriche it flows into the flat Amazon basin.Although historically, the term "Marañon River" often was applied to the river all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, nowadays the Marañon River is generally thought to end at the confluence with the Ucayali River, after which most cartographers label the ensuing waterway the Amazon River.

Morona<====>19866<====>Morona The Morona is a tributary to the Amazon River, and flows parallel to the Pastaza River and immediately to the west of it, and is the last stream of any importance on the northern side of the Amazon before reaching the Pongo de Manseriche. It is formed from a multitude of water-courses which descend the slopes of the Ecuadorian Andes south of the gigantic volcano of Sangay; but it soon reaches the plain, which commences where it receives its Cusulima branch.   The Morona is navigable for small craft for about 300 miles above its mouth, but it is extremely tortuous. 

Max Newman<====>19867<====>Max Newman   Maxwell Herman Alexander Max Newman, FRS    (7 February 1897 – 22 February 1984) was a British mathematician and codebreaker.  His work in World War II led to the construction of Colossus,    the world's first operational, programmable electronic computer, and he established the Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at the University of Manchester which produced the world's first working, modern stored program electronic computer in 1948, the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine.Education and early lifeMax Newman was born Maxwell Herman Alexander Neumann in Chelsea, London, England to a Jewish family, on 7 February 1897. 

Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority<====>19869<====>Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority   The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (abbreviated MBTA and known colloquially as The T)   is the public agency responsible for operating most public transportation services in Greater Boston, Massachusetts.  Earlier modes of public transportation in Boston were independently owned and operated; many were first folded into a single agency with the formation of the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) in 1947.  The MTA was replaced in 1964 with the present-day MBTA, which was established as an individual department within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts before becoming a division of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) in 2009. 

Meson<====>19870<====>Meson  In particle physics, mesons (  or  ) are hadronic subatomic particles composed of one quark and one antiquark, bound together by the strong interaction.  Because mesons are composed of quark sub-particles, they have a physical size, with a diameter of roughly one femtometer,  which is about 1. 2 times the size of a proton or neutron.  All mesons are unstable, with the longest-lived lasting for only a few hundredths of a microsecond.  Charged mesons decay (sometimes through mediating particles) to form electrons and neutrinos.  Uncharged mesons may decay to photons.  Both of these decays imply that color is no longer a property of the byproducts. 

Marvel Super Heroes (role-playing game)<====>19871<====>Marvel Super Heroes (role-playing game)  Marvel Super Heroes (MSHRPG) is a role playing game set in the Marvel Universe, first published by TSR as Marvel Super Heroes: The Heroic Role-Playing Game under license from Marvel Comics in 1984.In 1986, TSR published an expanded edition, entitled the Marvel Superheroes Advanced Game.  Jeff Grubb designed both editions, and Steve Winter wrote both editions.  Both use the same game system. The basic game was designed to let players assume the roles of superheroes from Marvel Comics, such as Spider-Man, Daredevil, Hulk, Captain America, the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, and others. 

Measure (mathematics)<====>19873<====>Measure (mathematics)  In mathematical analysis, a measure on a set is a systematic way to assign a number to each suitable subset of that set, intuitively interpreted as its size.  In this sense, a measure is a generalization of the concepts of length, area, and volume.  A particularly important example is the Lebesgue measure on a Euclidean space, which assigns the conventional length, area, and volume of Euclidean geometry to suitable subsets of the  -dimensional Euclidean space  .  For instance, the Lebesgue measure of the interval   in the real numbers is its length in the everyday sense of the word – specifically, 1. 

Motorcycle<====>19876<====>Motorcycle  A motorcycle often called a bike, motorbike, or cycle is a two- >    or three-wheeledmotor vehicle.  Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport including racing, and off-road riding.   Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies. In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first series production motorcycle, and the first to be called a motorcycle.  In 2014, the three top motorcycle producers globally by volume were Honda, Yamaha (both from Japan), and Hero MotoCorp (India). 

Map<====>19877<====>Map    A map is a symbolic depiction emphasizing relationships between elements of some space, such as objects, regions, or themes. Many maps are static, fixed to paper or some other durable medium, while others are dynamic or interactive.  Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any space, real or imagined, without regard to context or scale, such as in brain mapping, DNA mapping, or computer network topology mapping.  The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth, three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent variables. 

Management<====>19881<====>Management  Management (or managing) is the administration of an organization, whether it is a business, a not-for-profit organization, or government body.  Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the efforts of its employees (or of volunteers) to accomplish its objectives through the application of available resources, such as financial, natural, technological, and human resources.  The term "management" may also refer to those people who manage an organization. Social scientists study management as an academic discipline, investigating areas such as social organization and organizational leadership.  Some people study management at colleges or universities; major degrees in management include the Bachelor of Commerce (B. 

Mineralogy<====>19883<====>MineralogyMineralogy  is a subject of geology specializing in the scientific study of chemistry, crystal structure, and physical (including optical) properties of minerals and mineralized artifacts.  Specific studies within mineralogy include the processes of mineral origin and formation, classification of minerals, their geographical distribution, as well as their utilization. History Early writing on mineralogy, especially on gemstones, comes from ancient Babylonia, the ancient Greco-Roman world, ancient and medieval China, and Sanskrit texts from ancient India and the ancient Islamic World.Books on the subject included the Naturalis Historia of Pliny the Elder, which not only described many different minerals but also explained many of their properties, and Kitab al Jawahir (Book of Precious Stones) by Persian scientist Al Biruni. 

Maple syrup<====>19886<====>Maple syrup  Maple syrup is a syrup usually made from the xylem sap of sugar maple, red maple, or black maple trees, although it can also be made from other maple species.  In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before the winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring.  Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup. Maple syrup was first collected and used by the indigenous peoples of North America, and the practice was adopted by European settlers, who gradually refined production methods. 

Macron (diacritic)<====>19891<====>Macron (diacritic)A macron ( ) is a diacritical mark: it is a straight bar   placed above a letter, usually a vowel.  Its name derives  , since it was originally used to mark long or heavy syllables in Greco-Roman metrics.  It now more often marks a long vowel.  In the International Phonetic Alphabet, the macron is used to indicate a mid-tone; the sign for a long vowel is instead a modified triangular colon  . The opposite is the breve  , which marks a short or light syllable or a short vowel. 

Mosque<====>19894<====>Mosque   A mosque ( ; from  ) is a place of worship for followers of Islam.  There are strict and detailed requirements in Sunni jurisprudence (fiqh) for a place of worship to be considered a mosque, with places that do not meet these requirements regarded as musallas.There are stringent restrictions on the uses of the area formally demarcated as the mosque (which is often a small portion of the larger complex), and, in the Islamic Sharia law, after an area is formally designated as a mosque, it remains so until the Last Day. 

Molecular cloud<====>19895<====>Molecular cloud A molecular cloud, sometimes called a stellar nursery (if star formation is occurring within), is a type of interstellar cloud, the density and size of which permit the formation of molecules, most commonly molecular hydrogen (H 2 ).  This is in contrast to other areas of the interstellar medium that contain predominantly ionized gas. Molecular hydrogen is difficult to detect by infrared and radio observations, so the molecule most often used to determine the presence of H 2  is carbon monoxide (CO).  The ratio between CO luminosity and H 2  mass is thought to be constant, although there are reasons to doubt this assumption in observations of some other galaxies. 

Minoru Yamasaki<====>19897<====>Minoru Yamasaki Minoru Yamasaki (December 1, 1912 February 6, 1986  ) was an American architect, best known for designing the original World Trade Center in New York City and several other large-scale projects.Yamasaki was one of the most prominent architects of the 20th century.  He and fellow architect Edward Durell Stone are generally considered to be the two master practitioners of "New Formalism".  Early life and educationYamasaki was born in Seattle, Washington, the son of John Tsunejiro Yamasaki and Hana Yamasaki, Japanese descendants. The family later moved to Auburn, Washington and he graduated from Garfield Senior High School in Seattle.

Marlon Brando<====>19903<====>Marlon Brando  Marlon Brando Jr.  (April 3, 1924 – July 1, 2004) was an American actor, film director, and activist.  He is credited with bringing realism to film acting, helping to popularize the Stanislavski system of acting, studying with Stella Adler in the 1940s.  He is considered by many as one of the greatest and most influential actors of all time.  Brando is widely known for his Academy Award-winning performances as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront (1954) and Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather (1972).  He is also remembered for his performances in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), Viva Zapata! (1952), Julius Caesar (1953), The Wild One (1953), Guys and Dolls (1955), Sayonara (1957), Last Tango in Paris (1972), and Apocalypse Now (1979). 

Meteorology<====>19904<====>Meteorology    Meteorology is a branch of the atmospheric sciences which includes atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric physics, with a major focus on weather forecasting.   The study of meteorology dates back millennia, though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the 18th century.  The 19th century saw modest progress in the field after weather observation networks were formed across broad regions.  Prior attempts at prediction of weather depended on historical data.  It wasn't until after the elucidation of the laws of physics and, more particularly, the development of the computer, allowing for the automated solution of a great many equations that model the weather, in the latter half of the 20th century that significant breakthroughs in weather forecasting were achieved. 

Meitnerium<====>19916<====>Meitnerium Meitnerium is a synthetic chemical element with symbol Mt and atomic number 109.  It is an extremely radioactive synthetic element (an element not found in nature that can be created in a laboratory).  The most stable known isotope, meitnerium-278, has a half-life of 7. 6 seconds, although the unconfirmed meitnerium-282 may have a longer half-life of 67 seconds.  The GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany, first created this element in 1982.  It is named for Lise Meitner. In the periodic table, meitnerium is a d-block transactinide element.  It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in the group 9 elements, although no chemical experiments have yet been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to iridium in group 9 as the seventh member of the 6d series of transition metals. 

Megabyte<====>19918<====>Megabyte  The megabyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information.  Its recommended unit symbol is MB.   The unit prefix mega is a multiplier of   (10 6 ) in the International System of Units (SI).Therefore, one megabyte is one million bytes of information.  This definition has been incorporated into the International System of Quantities. However, in the computer and information technology fields, several other definitions are used that arose for historical reasons of convenience.  A common usage has been to designate one megabyte as   (2 20  B), a measurement that conveniently expresses the binary multiples inherent in digital computer memory architectures. 

Monosaccharide<====>19919<====>Monosaccharide Monosaccharides (from Greek  : single, sacchar: sugar), also called simple sugars, are the most basic units of carbohydrates.   They are fundamental units of carbohydrates and cannot be further hydrolyzed to simpler compounds.  The general formula is  .  They are the simplest form of sugar and are usually colorless, water-soluble, and crystalline solids.  Some monosaccharides have a sweet taste.  Examples of monosaccharides include glucose (dextrose), fructose (levulose) and galactose.  Monosaccharides are the building blocks of disaccharides (such as sucrose and lactose) and polysaccharides (such as cellulose and starch).  Further, each carbon atom that supports a hydroxyl group (so, all of the carbons except for the primary and terminal carbon) is chiral, giving rise to a number of isomeric forms, all with the same chemical formula. 

Microscopium<====>19924<====>Microscopium  Microscopium    is a minor constellation in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere, one of twelve created in the 18th century by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille and one of several depicting scientific instruments.  Its name is a Latinised form of the Greek word for microscope.  Its stars are faint and hardly visible from most of the non-tropical Northern Hemisphere. The constellation's brightest star is Gamma Microscopii of apparent magnitude 4. 68, a yellow giant 2. 5 times the Sun's mass located around 381 light-years distant.  It passed within 1. 14 and 3. 45 light-years of the Sun some 3.

Metre (poetry)<====>19930<====>Metre (poetry) In  poetry, metre is the basic rhythmic structure of a verse or lines in verse.   Many traditional verse forms prescribe a specific verse metre, or a certain set of metres alternating in a particular order.  The study and the actual use of metres and forms of versification are both known as prosody.  (Within linguistics, "prosody" is used in a more general sense that includes not only poetic metre but also the rhythmic aspects of prose, whether formal or informal, that vary from language to language, and sometimes between poetic traditions. )CharacteristicsAn assortment of features can be identified when classifying poetry and its metre. 

Majed Moqed<====>19932<====>Majed Moqed A former law student, Majed Mashaan Ghanem Moqed ( ,  ; also transliterated as Moqued) (June 18, 1977   – September 11, 2001) was one of five hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77 as part of the September 11 attacks. A Saudi, Moqed was studying law at a university in Saudi Arabia before joining Al-Qaeda in 1999 and being chosen to participate in the 9/11 attacks.  He arrived in the United States in May 2001 and helped with the planning of how the attacks would be carried out. On September 11, 2001, Moqed boarded American Airlines Flight 77 and assisted in the hijacking of the plane so that it could be crashed into the Pentagon. 

Mimeograph<====>19935<====>Mimeograph   The stencil duplicator or mimeograph machine (often abbreviated to mimeo) is a low-cost duplicating machine that works by forcing ink through a stencil onto paper.   The mimeograph process should not be confused with the spirit duplicator process. Mimeographs, along with spirit duplicators and hectographs, were a common technology in printing small quantities, as in office work, classroom materials, and church bulletins.  Early fanzines were printed with this technology, because it was widespread and cheap.  In the late 1960s, mimeographs, spirit duplicators, and hectographs began to be gradually displaced by photocopying. OriginsUse of stencils is an ancient art but through chemistry, papers, and presses techniques advanced rapidly in the late nineteenth century:PapyrographA description of the Papyrograph method of duplication was published by David Owen:   A major beneficiary of the invention of synthetic dyes was a document reproduction technique known as stencil duplicating. 

Meteorite<====>19937<====>Meteorite    A meteorite is a solid piece of debris from an object, such as a comet, asteroid, or meteoroid, that originates in outer space and survives its passage through the atmosphere to reach the surface of a planet or moon.  When the object enters the atmosphere, various factors like friction, pressure, and chemical interactions with the atmospheric gases cause it to heat up and radiate that energy.  It then becomes a meteor and forms a fireball, also known as a shooting star or falling star; astronomers call the brightest examples "bolides. " Meteorites vary greatly in size. 

Mega-<====>19938<====>Mega-  Mega is a unit prefix in metric systems of units denoting a factor of one million (10 6  or  ).  It has the unit symbol M.  It was confirmed for use in the International System of Units (SI) in 1960.  Mega comes from the Greek    , meaning "great".  Common examples of usageMegapixel: 1 million pixels in a digital cameraOne megatonne of TNT equivalent amounts to approx.  4 petajoules and is the approximate energy released on igniting one million tonnes of TNT.  The unit is often used in measuring the explosive power of nuclear weapons.

He began his political career in 1980 / 1981 as one of the leaders of the Students' Solidarity; he was governor of the Gdańsk Voivodship from August 1990 to July 1996, and was elected to the Sejm (the lower house of the Polish parliament) in September 1997.  To date he is longest serving Marshal of the Sejm of the Third Republic of PolandIn January 2001, he founded the Civic Platform political party with Donald Tusk and Andrzej Olechowski. 

Mark Bingham<====>19941<====>Mark Bingham  Mark Kendall Bingham (May 22, 1970 – September 11, 2001) was an American public relations executive who founded his own company, the Bingham Group.  During the September 11 attacks in 2001, he was a passenger on board United Airlines Flight 93.  Bingham was among the passengers who, along with Todd Beamer, Tom Burnett and Jeremy Glick, formed the plan to retake the plane from the hijackers, and led the effort that resulted in the crash of the plane into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, thwarting the hijackers plan to crash the plane into a building in Washington, D. 

Manner of articulation<====>19942<====>Manner of articulation  In articulatory phonetics, the manner of articulation is the configuration and interaction of the articulators (speech organs such as the tongue, lips, and palate) when making a speech sound.  One parameter of manner is stricture, that is, how closely the speech organs approach one another.  Others include those involved in the r-like sounds (taps and trills), and the sibilancy of fricatives. The concept of manner is mainly used in the discussion of consonants, although the movement of the articulators will also greatly alter the resonant properties of the vocal tract, thereby changing the formant structure of speech sounds that is crucial for the identification of vowels.

Motherboard<====>19945<====>Motherboard A motherboard (sometimes alternatively known as the mainboard, system board, baseboard, planar board or logic board,    or colloquially, a mobo) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) found in general purpose microcomputers and other expandable systems.  It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals.  Unlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems such as the central processor, the chipset's input/output and memory controllers, interface connectors, and other components integrated for general purpose use. 

Mannerism<====>19947<====>Mannerism Mannerism, also known as Late Renaissance,  is a style in European art that emerged in the later years of the Italian High Renaissance around 1520 and lasted until about end of the 16th century in Italy, when the Baroque style began to replace it.  Northern Mannerism continued into the early 17th century.  Stylistically, Mannerism encompasses a variety of approaches influenced by, and reacting to, the harmonious ideals associated with artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and early Michelangelo.  Where High Renaissance art emphasizes proportion, balance, and ideal beauty, Mannerism exaggerates such qualities, often resulting in compositions that are asymmetrical or unnaturally elegant. 

Monica Lewinsky<====>19948<====>Monica LewinskyMonica Samille Lewinsky (born July 23, 1973) is an American activist, television personality, fashion designer, and former White House intern. Lewinsky became famous after President Bill Clinton admitted to having had what he called an "inappropriate relationship" with her while she worked at the White House in 1995–1996.  The alleged affair and its repercussions (which included Clinton's impeachment) became known later as the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. As a result of the public coverage of the political scandal, Lewinsky gained international celebrity status; she subsequently engaged in a variety of ventures that included designing a line of handbags under her name, being an advertising spokesperson for a diet plan, and working as a television personality. 

Pressure measurement<====>19951<====>Pressure measurementPressure measurement is the analysis of an applied force by a fluid (liquid or gas) on a surface.  Pressure is typically measured in units of force per unit of surface area.  Many techniques have been developed for the measurement of pressure and vacuum.  Instruments used to measure and display pressure in an integral unit are called pressure gauges or vacuum gauges.  A manometer is a good example as it uses a column of liquid to both measure and indicate pressure.  Likewise the widely used Bourdon gauge is a mechanical device which both measures and indicates, and is probably the best known type of gauge. 

Medieval dance<====>19953<====>Medieval danceSources for an understanding of dance in Europe in the Middle Ages are limited and fragmentary, being composed of some interesting depictions in paintings and illuminations, a few musical examples of what may be dances, and scattered allusions in literary texts.  The first detailed descriptions of dancing only date from 1451 in Italy, which is after the start of the Renaissance in Western Europe.  CarolFor the carol as a musical form see: Carol, Christmas carolThe most documented form of dance during the Middle Ages is the carol also called the "carole" or "carola" and known from the 12th and 13th centuries in Western Europe in rural and court settings. 

Megatokyo<====>19955<====>Megatokyo(also stylized as MegaTokyo) is an English-language webcomic created by Fred Gallagher and Rodney Caston.  Megatokyo debuted on August 14, 2000,  and has been written and illustrated solely by Gallagher since July 17, 2002.    Fred Gallagher's news post announcing Caston's departure.   Gallagher's style of writing and illustration is heavily influenced by Japanese manga.  Megatokyo is freely available on its official website.   The stated schedule for updates is Tuesday and Friday, but they typically are posted just once or twice a month on non-specific days (in the beginning a three-per-week schedule of Monday, Wednesday, and Friday was the goal). 

Medieval music<====>19956<====>Medieval music   Medieval music consists of songs, instrumental pieces, and liturgical music from about 500 A. D.  to 1400.  Medieval music was an era of Western music, including liturgical music (also known as sacred) used for the church, and secular music, non-religious music.  Medieval music includes solely vocal music, such as Gregorian chant and choral music (music for a group of singers), solely instrumental music, and music that uses both voices and instruments (typically with the instruments accompanying the voices).  Gregorian chant was sung by monks during Catholic Mass.  The Mass is a reenactment of Christ's Last Supper, intended to provide a spiritual connection between man and God. 

Maser<====>19957<====>Maser  A maser ( , an acronym for "microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation") is a device that produces coherent electromagnetic waves through amplification by stimulated emission.  The first maser was built by Charles H.  Townes, James P.  Gordon, and H.  J.  Zeiger at Columbia University in 1953.   Townes, Nikolay Basov and Alexander Prokhorov were awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics for theoretical work leading to the maser.   Masers are used as the timekeeping device in atomic clocks, and as extremely low-noise microwave amplifiers in radio telescopes and deep space spacecraft communication ground stations. 

Mario Botta<====>19958<====>Mario Botta Mario Botta (born April 1, 1943) is a Swiss architect.   He studied at the Liceo Artistico in Milan and the IUAV in Venice.  His ideas were influenced by Le Corbusier, Carlo Scarpa, Louis Kahn.  He opened his own practice in 1970 in Lugano. CareerBotta designed his first buildings at age 16, a two-family house at Morbio Superiore in Ticino.  While the arrangements of spaces in this structure is inconsistent, its relationship to its site, separation of living from service spaces, and deep window recesses echo of what would become his stark, strong, towering style. 

Mark Antony<====>19960<====>Mark Antony   Marcus Antonius (Latin:  ;Mark Antony's full name was Marcus Antonius Marci filius Marci nepos; in English, "Marcus Antonius, son of Marcus, grandson of Marcus".  In Classical Latin, it was spelled   and pronounced   January 14,   August 1, 30 BC), commonly known in English as Mark or Marc Antony, was a Roman politician and general who played a critical role in the transformation of the Roman Republic from an oligarchy into the autocratic Roman Empire. Antony was a supporter of Julius Caesar, and served as one of his generals during the conquest of Gaul and the Civil War.

Mesa (programming language)<====>19962<====>Mesa (programming language)  Mesa  is a programming language developed in the late 1970s at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in Palo Alto, California, United States.  The language name was a pun based upon the programming language catchphrases of the time, because Mesa is a "high level" programming language. Mesa is an ALGOL-like language with strong support for modular programming.  Every library module has at least two source files: a definitions file specifying the library's interface plus one or more program files specifying the implementation of the procedures in the interface.   To use a library, a program or higher-level library must "import" the definitions. 

Marsilio Ficino<====>19963<====>Marsilio Ficino   Marsilio Ficino ( ; Latin name: Marsilius Ficinus; 19 October 1433 – 1 October 1499) was an Italian scholar and Catholic priest who was one of the most influential humanist philosophers of the early Italian Renaissance.  He was an astrologer, a reviver of Neoplatonism in touch with every major academic thinker and writer of his day  and the first translator of Plato's complete extant works into Latin.   His Florentine Academy, an attempt to revive Plato's Academy, influenced the direction and tenor of the Italian Renaissance and the development of European philosophy. BiographyFicino was born at Figline Valdarno. 

Morphogenesis<====>19965<====>Morphogenesis Morphogenesis (from the Greek morphê shape and genesis creation, literally, "beginning of the shape") is the biological process that causes an organism to develop its shape.  It is one of three fundamental aspects of developmental biology along with the control of cell growth and cellular differentiation, unified in evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo). The process controls the organized spatial distribution of cells during the embryonic development of an organism.  Morphogenesis can take place also in a mature organism, in cell culture or inside tumor cell masses.  Morphogenesis also describes the development of unicellular life forms that do not have an embryonic stage in their life cycle, or describes the evolution of a body structure within a taxonomic group. 

Magical organization<====>19972<====>Magical organization A magical organization or magical order is an organization created for the practice of magic or to further the knowledge of magic among its members.  "Magic" in this case refers to occult, metaphysical and paranormal activities, not to the performance of stage magic.  Magical organizations can include hermetic orders, Wiccan covens or Wiccan circles, esoteric societies, arcane colleges, witches' covens, and other groups which may use different terminology and similar though diverse practices. Significant orders and organizationsThe Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn has been credited with a vast revival of occult literature and practices and was founded in 1887 or 1888 by William Wynn Westcott, Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers and William Robert Woodman. 

Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab<====>19975<====>Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab  Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab ( ;  ; 1703 – 22 June 1792) was a religious leader and theologian from Najd in central Arabia who founded the movement now called Wahhabism.  Born to a family of jurists, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's early education consisted of learning a fairly standard curriculum of orthodox jurisprudence according to the Hanbali school of law, which was the school of law most prevalent in his area of birth.   Despite his initial rudimentary training in classical Sunni Muslim tradition, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab gradually became opposed to many of the most popular and established Sunni practices agreed upon by the consensus of the scholars,  such as the veneration of saints and the visitation of their tombs,  which he felt amounted to heretical religious innovation or even idolatry. 

Maine<====>19977<====>MaineMaine ( ) is the northernmost state in the New England region of the northeastern United States.  Maine is the 39th most extensive and the 9th least populous of the U. S.  states and territories.  It is bordered by New Hampshire to the west, the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast, and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec to the northeast and northwest respectively.  Maine is the easternmost state in the contiguous United States, and the northernmost east of the Great Lakes.  It is known for its jagged, rocky coastline; low, rolling mountains; heavily forested interior, and picturesque waterways; and also its seafood cuisine, especially clams and lobster. 

Montana<====>19978<====>Montana   Montana   is a state in the northwestern region of the United States.  Montana has several nicknames, although none official,  including "Big Sky Country" and "The Treasure State", and slogans that include "Land of the Shining Mountains" and more recently "The Last Best Place".  Montana is the 4th largest in area, the 7th least populous, and the 3rd sparsely populated of the 50 U. S.  states.  The western third of Montana contains numerous mountain ranges.  Smaller island ranges are found throughout the state.  In total, 77 named ranges are part of the Rocky Mountains. 

Machine translation<====>19980<====>Machine translationMachine translation, sometimes referred to by the abbreviation MT (not to be confused with computer-aided translation, machine-aided human translation (MAHT) or interactive translation) is a sub-field of computational linguistics that investigates the use of software to translate text or speech from one language to another. On a basic level, MT performs simple substitution of words in one  language for words in another, but that alone usually cannot produce a good translation of a text because recognition of whole phrases and their closest counterparts in the target language is needed.  Solving this problem with corpus statistical, and neural techniques is a rapidly growing field that is leading to better translations, handling differences in linguistic typology, translation of idioms, and the isolation of anomalies. 

Central moment<====>19983<====>Central moment In probability theory and statistics, a central moment is a moment of a probability distribution of a random variable about the random variable's mean; that is, it is the expected value of a specified integer power of the deviation of the random variable from the mean.  The various moments form one set of values by which the properties of a probability distribution can be usefully characterised.  Central moments are used in preference to ordinary moments, computed in terms of deviations from the mean instead of from zero, because the higher-order central moments relate only to the spread and shape of the distribution, rather than also to its location. 

Murad I<====>19986<====>Murad I  Murad I ( ;   (nicknamed Hüdavendigâr, from Persian: خداوندگار, Khodāvandgār, "the devotee of God" – but meaning "sovereign" in this context); 29 June 1326, Amasya – 15 June 1389, Kosovo Field), was the Ottoman Sultan from 1362 to 1389.  He was a son of Orhan and the Valide Nilüfer Hatun. Murad I conquered Adrianople, renamed it to Edirne,  and in 1363 made it the new capital of the Ottoman Sultanate.   Then he further expanded the Ottoman realm in Southeast Europe by bringing most of the Balkans under Ottoman rule, and forced the princes of northern Serbia and Bulgaria as well as the Byzantine emperor John V Palaiologos to pay him tribute. 

Mehmed I<====>19987<====>Mehmed I   Mehmed I (1381 – 26 May 1421), also known as Mehmed Çelebi ( , "the noble-born") or Kirişci (from Greek Kyritzes, "lord's son"),   was the Ottoman Sultan from 1413 to 1421.  The fourth son of Sultan Bayezid I and Devlet Hatun, he fought with his brothers over control of the Ottoman realm in the Ottoman Interregnum (1402–1413).  Starting from the province of Rûm he managed to bring first Anatolia and then the European territories (Rumelia) under his control, reuniting the Ottoman state by 1413, and ruling it until his death in 1421. 

Murad II<====>19988<====>Murad II    Murad II (June 1404 – 3 February 1451) (Ottoman Turkish: مراد ثانى Murād-ı  s ānī, Turkish:II.  Murat) was the Ottoman Sultan from 1421 to 1444 and 1446 to 1451. Murad II's reign was marked by the long war he fought against the Christian feudal lords of the Balkans and the Turkish beyliks in Anatolia, a conflict that lasted 25 years.  He was brought up in Amasya, and ascended the throne on the death of his father Mehmed I.  His mother was Valide Sultan Emine Hatun (daughter of Suleyman Bey, ruler of Dulkadirids), his father's third consort. 

Murad III<====>19989<====>Murad III  Murad III (Ottoman Turkish: مراد ثالث Murād-i  s āli s , Turkish: III. Murat)  (4 July 1546 –  15/16 January 1595)  was the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1574 until his death in 1595. Early lifeBorn in Bozdağan or Manisa on 4 July 1546, Şehzade Murad was the oldest son of Sultan Selim II and Afife Nurbanu Sultan.  After his ceremonial circumcision in 1557, Murad was appointed sancakbeyi of Akşehir by Suleyman I (his grandfather) in 1558.  At the age of 18 he was appointed sancakbeyi of Saruhan.  Suleiman died when Murad was 22, and his father became the new sultan. 

Mehmed III<====>19990<====>Mehmed III Mehmed III ( , Meḥmed-i  s āli s ;  ; 26 May 1566–21 December 1603)  was Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1595 until his death in 1603. Early life Mehmed was born at the Manisa Palace in 1566, during the reign of his great-grandfather, Suleiman the Magnificent.  He was the son of Şehzade Murad (later Murad III), himself the son of Şehzade Selim (later Selim II), who was the son of Sultan Suleiman and Hürrem Sultan.  His mother was Safiye Sultan, an Albanian from the Dukagjin highlands.   His great-grandfather died the year he was born and his grandfather became the new Sultan, Selim II. 

Mustafa I<====>19991<====>Mustafa I Mustafa I (24 June 1591 – 20 January 1639) ( ), called Mustafa the Saint (Veli Mustafa) during his second reign and often called Mustafa the Mad (Deli Mustafa) by modern historians, was the son of Mehmed III and was the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1617 to 1618 and from 1622 to 1623. . Early lifeMustafa was born in the Manisa Palace, as the younger brother of Ahmed I (1603–17).  His mother was Halime Sultan, an Abkhazian lady.  Before 1603 it was customary for an Ottoman Sultan to have his brothers executed shortly after he gained the throne (Mustafa's father Mehmed III had executed 19 of his own brothers). 

Murad IV<====>19992<====>Murad IV  Murad IV ( , Murād-ı Rābiʿ;  26/27 July 1612 – 8 February 1640)  was the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1623 to 1640, known both for restoring the authority of the state and for the brutality of his methods.  Murad IV was born in Istanbul, the son of Sultan Ahmed I (r.  1603–17) and the ethnic Greek Kösem Sultan.   Brought to power by a palace conspiracy in 1623, he succeeded his uncle Mustafa I (r.  1617–18, 1622–23).  He was only 11 when he took the throne.  His reign is most notable for the Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–39), of which the outcome would permanently part the Caucasus between the two Imperial powers for around two centuries, while it also roughly laid the foundation for the current Turkey–Iran–Iraq borders. 

Masamune Shirow<====>19994<====>Masamune Shirow is the pen name  of Japanese manga artist Masanori Ota.   The pen name is derived from the legendary sword-smith Masamune.  Shirow is best known for the manga Ghost in the Shell, which has since been turned into two theatrical anime movies, two anime television series, an anime television movie, an anime OVA series, a theatrical live action movie, and several video games.  Shirow is also known for creating erotic art. CareerBorn in the Hyōgo Prefecture capital city of Kobe, he studied oil painting at Osaka University of Arts. 

Musical saw<====>19995<====>Musical saw   A musical saw, also called a singing saw, is a hand saw used as a musical instrument.  Capable of continuous glissando (portamento), the sound creates an ethereal tone, very similar to the theremin.  The musical saw is classified as a plaque friction idiophone with direct friction (132. 22) under the Hornbostel-Sachs system of musical instrument classification. Playing The saw is generally played seated with the handle squeezed between the legs, and the far end held with one hand.  Some sawists play standing, either with the handle between the knees and the blade sticking out in front of them. 

MIDI<====>19996<====>MIDI  MIDI ( ; short for Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a technical standard that describes a communications protocol, digital interface, and electrical connectors and allows a wide variety of electronic musical instruments, computers and other related music and audio devices to connect and communicate with one another.   A single MIDI link can carry up to sixteen channels of information, each of which can be routed to a separate device. MIDI carries event messages that specify notation, pitch and velocity (loudness or softness), control signals for parameters such as volume, vibrato, audio panning from left to right, cues in theatre, and clock signals that set and synchronize tempo between multiple devices. 

Microcode<====>19999<====>MicrocodeMicrocode is "a technique that imposes an interpreter between the hardware and the architectural level of a computer".As such, the microcode is a layer of hardware-level instructions that implement higher-level machine code instructions or internal state machine sequencing in many digital processing elements.   Microcode is used in general-purpose central processing units, as well as in more specialized processors such as microcontrollers, digital signal processors, channel controllers, disk controllers, network interface controllers, network processors, graphics processing units, and in other hardware. Microcode typically resides in special high-speed memory and translates machine instructions, state machine data or other input into sequences of detailed circuit-level operations. 

Multitier architecture<====>20003<====>Multitier architecture  In software engineering, multitier architecture (often referred to as n-tier architecture) or multilayered architecture is a client–server architecture in which presentation, application processing, and data management functions are physically separated.  The most widespread use of multitier architecture is the three-tier architecture. N-tier application architecture provides a model by which developers can create flexible and reusable applications.  By segregating an application into tiers, developers acquire the option of modifying or adding a specific layer, instead of reworking the entire application.  A three-tier architecture is typically composed of a presentation tier, a domain logic tier, and a data storage tier. 

Myrinet<====>20016<====>Myrinet Myrinet, ANSI/VITA 26-1998, is a high-speed local area networking system designed by the company Myricom to be used as an interconnect between multiple machines to form computer clusters.  DescriptionMyrinet was promoted as having lower protocol overhead than standards such as Ethernet, and therefore better throughput, less interference, and lower latency while using the host CPU.  Although it can be used as a traditional networking system, Myrinet is often used directly by programs that "know" about it, thereby bypassing a call into the operating system. Myrinet physically consists of two fibre optic cables, upstream and downstream, connected to the host computers with a single connector. 

Musique concrète<====>20017<====>Musique concrèteMusique concrète ( , meaning "concrete music") "[A] problem for any translator of an academic work in French is that the language is relatively abstract and theoretical compared to English; one might even say that the mode of thinking itself tends to be more schematic, with a readiness to see material for study in terms of highly abstract dualisms and correlations, which on occasion does not sit easily with the perhaps more pragmatic English language.  This creates several problems of translation affecting key terms.  Perhaps the most obvious of these is the word concret/concrète itself.  The word in French, which has nothing of the familiar meaning of "concrete" in English, isused throughout [In Search of a Concrete Music] with all its usual French connotations of "palpable," "nontheoretical," and "experiential," all of which pertain to a greater or lesser extent to the type of music Schaeffer is pioneering. 

Metric space<====>20018<====>Metric spaceIn mathematics, a metric space is a set for which distances  between all members of the set are defined.  Those distances, taken together, are  called a metric on the set.  A metric on a space induces topological properties like open and closed sets, which lead to the study of more abstract topological spaces. The most familiar metric space is 3-dimensional Euclidean space.  In fact, a "metric" is the generalization of the Euclidean metric arising from the four long-known properties of the Euclidean distance.  The Euclidean metric  defines the distance between two points as the length of the straight line segment connecting them. 

Marine biology<====>20021<====>Marine biology  Marine biology is the scientific study of marine life, organisms in the sea.   Given that in biology many phyla, families and genera have some species that live in the sea and others that live on land, marine biology classifies species based on the environment rather than on taxonomy. A large proportion of all life on Earth lives in the ocean.  The exact size of this large proportion is unknown, since many ocean species are still to be discovered.  The ocean is a complex three-dimensional world  covering approximately 71% of the Earth's surface. 

Microkernel<====>20023<====>MicrokernelIn computer science, a microkernel (also known as μ-kernel) is the near-minimum amount of software that can provide the mechanisms needed to implement an operating system (OS).  These mechanisms include low-level address space management, thread management, and inter-process communication (IPC). If the hardware provides multiple rings or CPU modes, the microkernel may be the only software executing at the most privileged level, which is generally referred to as supervisor or kernel mode.  Traditional operating system functions, such as device drivers, protocol stacks and file systems, are typically removed from the microkernel itself and are instead run in user space.

Multihull<====>20025<====>Multihull A multihull is a ship, vessel, craft or boat with more than one hull.  Multihull ships (vessels, craft, boats) include multiple types, sizes and applications.  Hulls range from two to five, of uniform or diverse types and arrangementsCatamarans are the most common type, with two symmetric hulls.  They are used as racing, sailing, tourist and fishing boats.  About 70% of fast passenger and car-passenger ferries are catamarans.  About 300 semi-submersible drilling and auxiliary platforms operate at sea. Some ships with outriggers are built, including the experimental ship Tritone (UK) and the first and second sister-ships of the series of Littoral Combat Ships (US). 

Multics Relational Data Store<====>20029<====>Multics Relational Data Store The Multics Relational Data Store, or MRDS for short, was the first commercial relational database management system. It was written in PL/1 by Honeywell for the Multics operating system and first sold in June 1976. Unlike the SQL systems that emerged in the late 1970s and early 80's, MRDS used a command language only for basic data manipulation, equivalent to the  SELECT  or  UPDATE  statements in SQL. Other operations, like creating a new database, or general file management, required the use of a separate command program.References Paul McJones, "Multics Relational Data Store (MRDS)"

Mutual recursion<====>20034<====>Mutual recursion In mathematics and computer science, mutual recursion is a form of recursion where two mathematical or computational objects, such as functions or data types, are defined in terms of each other.   Mutual recursion is very common in functional programming and in some problem domains, such as recursive descent parsers, where the data types are naturally mutually recursive. ExamplesData types The most important basic example of a data type that can be defined by mutual recursion is a tree, which can be defined mutually recursively in terms of a forest (a list of trees).  Symbolically:f:  [t[1], . 

Metasyntactic variable<====>20036<====>Metasyntactic variable A metasyntactic variable is a specific word or set of words identified as a placeholder in computer science and specifically computer programming.  These words are commonly found in source code and are intended to be modified or substituted to be applicable to the specific usage before compilation (translation to an executable).  The words foo and bar are good examples as they are used in over 330 Internet Engineering Task Force Requests for Comments, which are documents explaining foundational internet technologies like HTTP (websites), TCP/IP, and email protocols.  RFC 3092 (rfc3092) - Etymology of "Foo"  By mathematical analogy, a metasyntactic variable is a word that is a variable for other words, just as in algebra letters are used as variables for numbers. 

Mondegreen<====>20038<====>MondegreenA mondegreen   is a mishearing or misinterpretation of a phrase as a result of near-homophony, in a way that gives it a new meaning.  Mondegreens are most often created by a person listening to a poem or a song; the listener, being unable to clearly hear a lyric, substitutes words that sound similar and make some kind of sense.    American writer Sylvia Wright coined the term in 1954, writing about how as a girl she had misheard the lyric ". . . and laid him on the green" in a Scottish ballad as ". 

Merge sort<====>20039<====>Merge sort  In computer science, merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm.  Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output.  Mergesort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.   A detailed description and analysis of bottom-up mergesort appeared in a report by Goldstine and Neumann as early as 1948.  AlgorithmConceptually, a merge sort works as follows:Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted).

Morita Masatake (1874-1938), also read as Morita Shoma (森田 正馬), was a contemporary of Sigmund Freud and the founder of Morita therapy, a branch of clinical psychology strongly influenced by Zen Buddhism.   In his capacity as the head of psychiatry for a large Tokyo hospital, Morita began developing his methods while working with sufferers of shinkeishitsu, or anxiety disorders with a hypochondriac base. Theory and methodsAccording to Morita, how a person feels is important as a sensation and as an indicator for the present moment, but is uncontrollable: we don't create feelings, feelings happen to us.

Mooney<====>20048<====>Mooney    Mooney is a family name, which is probably predominantly derived from the Irish Ó Maonaigh.  It can also be spelled Moony, Moonie, Mainey, Mauney, Meaney and Meeney depending on the dialectic pronunciation that was Anglicised. OriginsThe origin of the different Moony or Mooney families is lost in antiquity.  The name is derived from maoin a Gaelic word meaning wealth or treasure of treasure, hence when O'Maonaigh was anglicised to Mooney it meant the descendant of the wealthy one.  According to Irish lore, the Mooney family comes from one of the largest and most noble Irish lines.

Moving Picture Experts Group<====>20055<====>Moving Picture Experts Group The Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) is a working group of authorities that was formed by ISO and IEC to set standards for audio and video compression and transmission.  John Watkinson, The MPEG Handbook, p. 1  It was established in 1988 by the initiative of Hiroshi Yasuda (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone) and Leonardo Chiariglione,  group Chair since its inception.  The first MPEG meeting was in May 1988 in Ottawa, Canada.    As of late 2005, MPEG has grown to include approximately 350 members per meeting from various industries, universities, and research institutions. 

MPEG-1<====>20056<====>MPEG-1 MPEG-1 is a standard for lossy compression of video and audio.   It is designed to compress VHS-quality raw digital video and CD audio down to 1. 5 Mbit/s (26:1 and 6:1 compression ratios respectively)  without excessive quality loss, making video CDs, digital cable/satellite TV and digital audio broadcasting (DAB) possible.Today, MPEG-1 has become the most widely compatible lossy audio/video format in the world, and is used in a large number of products and technologies.   Perhaps the best-known part of the MPEG-1 standard is the MP3 audio format it introduced. 

Mumia Abu-Jamal<====>20057<====>Mumia Abu-Jamal   Mumia Abu-Jamal (born Wesley Cook;    April 24, 1954) is a convicted murderer, American activist and journalist who became involved in black nationalism in his youth and was a member of the Black Panther Party until October 1970.  He left the party and became a radio reporter, eventually becoming president of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists.  He was convicted and sentenced to death in 1982 for the murder of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner.  After numerous appeals, his sentence was commuted in 2011 to life imprisonment without parole. Some activists and human rights groups have criticized the quality of Abu-Jamal's trial;    some have claimed that he is innocent, and many opposed his death sentence. 

Multiplicative function<====>20059<====>Multiplicative functionOutside number theory, the term multiplicative function is usually used for completely multiplicative functions.  This article discusses number theoretic multiplicative functions. In number theory, a multiplicative function is an arithmetic function f(n) of a positive integer n with the property that f(1) = 1 and whenevera and b are coprime, then f(ab) = f(a)f(b).  An arithmetic function f(n) is said to be completely multiplicative (or totally multiplicative) if f(1) = 1 and f(ab) = f(a)f(b) holds for all positive integers a and b, even when they are not coprime. ExamplesSome multiplicative functions are defined to make formulas easier to write:1(n): the constant function, defined by 1(n) = 1 (completely multiplicative)Id(n): identity function, defined by Id(n) = n (completely multiplicative)Id k (n): the power functions, defined by Id k (n) = n k  for any complex number k (completely multiplicative). 

MPEG-2<====>20060<====>MPEG-2 MPEG-2 (a. k. a.  H. 222/H. 262 as defined by the ITU) is a standard for "the generic coding of moving pictures and associated audio information".   It describes a combination of lossy video compression and lossy audio data compression methods, which permit storage and transmission of movies using currently available storage media and transmission bandwidth.  While MPEG-2 is not as efficient as newer standards such as H. 264/AVC and H. 265/HEVC, backwards compatibility with existing hardware and software means it is still widely used, for example in over-the-air digital television broadcasting and in the DVD-Video standard. 

MPEG-3<====>20061<====>MPEG-3 MPEG-3 is the designation for a group of audio and video coding standards agreed upon by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) designed to handle HDTV signals at 1080p  in the range of 20 to 40 megabits per second.   MPEG-3 was launched as an effort to address the need of an HDTV standard while work on MPEG-2 was underway, but it was soon discovered that MPEG-2, at high data rates, would accommodate HDTV.   Thus, in 1992  HDTV was included as a separate profile in the MPEG-2 standard and MPEG-3 was rolled into MPEG-2. 

Meditation<====>20062<====>MeditationMeditation can be defined as a practice where an individual focuses his or her mind on a particular object, thought or activity to achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm state.Meditation may be used to reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and pain.It may be done while sitting, repeating a mantra, and closing the eyes in a quiet environment. Meditation has been practiced since antiquity in numerous religious traditions and beliefs.  Since the 19th century, it has spread from its Asian origins to Western cultures where it is commonly practiced in private and business life. 

MPEG-4<====>20063<====>MPEG-4MPEG-4 is a method of defining compression of audio and visual (AV) digital data.   It was introduced in late 1998 and designated a standard for a group of audio and video coding formats and related technology agreed upon by the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11) under the formal standard ISO/IEC 14496 – Coding of audio-visual objects.  Uses of MPEG-4 include compression of AV data for web (streaming media) and CD distribution, voice (telephone, videophone) and broadcast television applications. BackgroundMPEG-4 absorbs many of the features of MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 and other related standards, adding new features such as (extended) VRML support for 3D rendering, object-oriented composite files (including audio, video and VRML objects), support for externally specified Digital Rights Management and various types of interactivity. 

Maritime archaeology<====>20064<====>Maritime archaeology   Maritime archaeology (also known as marine archaeology) is a discipline within archaeology as a whole  that specifically studies human interaction with the sea,  lakes and rivers through the study of  associated physical remains, be they  vessels, shore side facilities, port-related structures, cargoes, human remains and submerged landscapes.    A specialty within maritime archaeology is nautical archaeology, which studies vessel construction and use.   As with archaeology as a whole, maritime archaeology can be practised within the historical, industrial, or prehistoric periods.    An associated discipline, and again one that lies within archaeology itself, is  underwater archaeology, which studies the past through any submerged remains be they of maritime interest or not. 

Morihei Ueshiba<====>20069<====>Morihei Ueshiba was a martial artist and founder of the Japanese martial art of aikido.  He is often referred to as "the founder"    or  , "Great Teacher". The son of a landowner from Tanabe, Ueshiba studied a number of martial arts in his youth, and served in the Japanese Army during the Russo-Japanese War.  After being discharged in 1907, he moved to Hokkaidō as the head of a pioneer settlement; here he met and studied with Takeda Sōkaku, the founder of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu.  On leaving Hokkaido in 1919, Ueshiba joined the Ōmoto-kyō movement, a Shinto sect, in Ayabe, where he served as a martial arts instructor and opened his first dojo. 

Memory address register<====>20070<====>Memory address register In a computer, the Memory Address  Register (MAR)  is the CPU register that either stores the memory address from which data will be fetched from the CPU or the address to which data will be sent and stored. In other words, MAR holds the memory location of data that needs to be accessed.  When reading from memory, data addressed by MAR is fed into the MDR (memory data register) and then used by the CPU. When writing to memory, the CPU writes data from MDR to the memory location whose address is stored in MAR. 

Microassembler<====>20072<====>Microassembler A microassembler is a computer program that helps prepare a microprogram, called firmware, to control the low level operation of a computer in much the same way an assembler helps prepare higher level code for a processor.  The difference is that the microprogram is usually only developed by the processor manufacturer and works intimately with the computer hardware.  On a microprogrammed computer the microprogram implements the operations of the instruction set in which any normal program (including both application programs and operating systems) is written.  The use of a microprogram allows the manufacturer to fix certain mistakes, including working around hardware design errors, without modifying the hardware. 

Machine pistol<====>20074<====>Machine pistol  A machine pistol is typically a handgun-style machine gun,  capable of fully automatic or burst fire, and chambered for pistol cartridges.  The term is a literal translation of the German word "Maschinenpistole". During World War I, the Austrians introduced the world's first machine pistol the Steyr Repetierpistole M1912/P16.  The Germans also experimented with machine pistols, by converting various types of semi-automatic pistols to full-auto, leading to the development of the first practical submachine gun.  During World War II, machine pistol development was more or less ignored as the major powers were focused on mass-producing submachine guns. 

Martin Luther King Jr.<====>20076<====>Martin Luther King Jr.  Martin Luther King Jr.  (born Michael King Jr. , January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American Baptist minister and activist who became the most visible spokesperson and leader in the civil rights movement from 1954 through 1968.  He is best known for his role in the advancement of civil rights using the tactics of nonviolence and civil disobedience based on his Christian beliefs and inspired by the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi. King became a civil rights activist early in his career.  He led the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in 1957, serving as its first president. 

Marino Marini (sculptor)<====>20080<====>Marino Marini (sculptor) Marino Marini (27 February 1901 – 6 August 1980) was an Italian sculptor.   BiographyHe attended the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence in 1917.  Although he never abandoned painting, Marini devoted himself primarily to sculpture from about 1922.  From this time his work was influenced by Etruscan art and the sculpture of Arturo Martini.  Marini succeeded Martini as professor at the Scuola d’Arte di Villa Reale in Monza, near Milan, in 1929, a position he retained until 1940. During this period, Marini traveled frequently to Paris, where he associated with Massimo Campigli, Giorgio de Chirico, Alberto Magnelli, and Filippo Tibertelli de Pisis. 

Modular arithmetic<====>20087<====>Modular arithmeticIn mathematics, modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" upon reaching a certain value—the modulus (plural moduli).   The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, published in 1801. A familiar use of modular arithmetic is in the 12-hour clock, in which the day is divided into two 12-hour periods.  If the time is 7:00 now, then 8 hours later it will be 3:00.  Usual addition would suggest that the later time should be  , but this is not the answer because clock time "wraps around" every 12 hours. 

Myriad<====>20088<====>Myriad   A myriad (from Ancient Greek  , myrias) is technically the number ten thousand; in that sense, the term is used almost exclusively in translations from Greek, Latin, or Chinese, or when talking about ancient Greek numbers.  More generally, a myriad may be an indefinitely large number of things.  History The Aegean numerals of the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations included a single unit to denote tens of thousands.  It was written with a symbol composed of a circle with four dashes  𐄫 .    In Classical Greek numerals, a myriad was written as a capital mu: Μ, as lower case letters did not exist in Ancient Greece.

Marmite<====>20090<====>Marmite    Marmite (   ) is the brand name for two similar food spreads: the original British version currently produced by Unilever; and a modified version produced in New Zealand by Sanitarium Health Food Company and distributed in Australia and the Pacific.  Marmite is made from yeast extract, a by-product of beer brewing.  Other similar products include the Australian Vegemite, the Swiss Cenovis and the German Vitam-R. The British version of the product is a sticky, dark brown food paste with a distinctive, powerful flavour, which is extremely salty.  This distinctive taste is reflected in the British company's marketing slogan: "Love it or hate it. 

Mabon ap Modron<====>20092<====>Mabon ap ModronMabon ap Modron is a prominent figure from Welsh literature and mythology, the son of Modron and a member of Arthur's war band.  Both he and his mother were likely deities in origin, descending from a divine mother–son pair.  His name is related to the Romano-British god Maponos, whose name means "Great Son"; Modron, in turn, is likely related to the Gaulish goddess Dea Matrona.  He is often equated with the Demetian hero Pryderi fab Pwyll, and may be associated with the minor Arthurian character Mabon fab Mellt.  EtymologyThe name Mabon is derived from the Common Brittonic and Gaulish deity name Maponos "Great Son", from the Proto-Celtic root *makwo- "son". 

Microwave<====>20097<====>Microwave   Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging from one meter to one millimeter; with  frequencies between   and  .    Different sources define different frequency ranges as microwaves; the above broad definition includes both UHF and EHF (millimeter wave) bands.   A more common definition in radio engineering is the range between 1 and 100 GHz (300 and 3 mm).    In all cases, microwaves include the entire SHF band (3 to 30 GHz, or 10 to 1 cm) at minimum.

It was the very first Gundam series, which has subsequently been adapted into numerous sequels and spin-offs.  Set in the futuristic calendar year "Universal Century" 0079, the plot focuses on the war between the Principality of Zeon and the Earth Federation, with the latter unveiling a new giant robot known as the RX-78-2 Gundam piloted by the teenage civilian mechanic Amuro Ray. 

Methodism<====>20119<====>Methodism    Methodism or the Methodist movement is a group of historically related denominations of Protestant Christianity which derive their inspiration from the life and teachings of John Wesley.  George Whitefield and John's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement.  It originated as a revival within the 18th century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley's death.  The movement spread throughout the British Empire, the United States, and beyond because of vigorous missionary work,    today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide.  This figure is an estimate by the World Methodist Council and includes members of united and uniting churches with Methodist participation. 

Mancala<====>20124<====>Mancala  Mancala, is a   name for a family of 2-player turn-based strategy board games played with small stones, beans, or seeds and rows of holes or pits in the earth, a board or other playing surface.   The objective is usually to capture all or some set of the opponent's stones, beans, etc.   Versions of the game have been played for at least hundreds of years around the world. The name is a classification or type of game, rather than any specific game.  Some of the most popular mancala games (with regard to distribution area, the numbers of players and  tournaments, and publications) are:Ali Guli Mane or Pallanguzhi – played in Southern India.

Marcomanni<====>20144<====>MarcomanniThe Marcomanni were a Germanic tribal confederation who eventually came to live in a powerful kingdom north of the Danube, somewhere in the region near modern Bohemia, during the peak of power of the nearby Roman Empire.  According to Tacitus and Strabo they were Suebian. HistoryOriginIt is believed their name derives possibly from the Proto-Germanic forms of "march" ("frontier, border") and "men", *Markōmanniz,    which would have been rendered in Latin form as Marcomanni. The Marcomanni first appear in historical records as confederates of the Suebi of Ariovistus fighting against Julius Caesar in Gaul (modern France), having crossed the Rhine from present-day southern Germany.

Maze<====>20161<====>Maze   A maze is a path or collection of paths, typically from an entrance to a goal.   The word is used to refer both to branching tour puzzles through which the solver must find a route, and to simpler non-branching ("unicursal") patterns that lead unambiguously through a convoluted layout to a goal.  (The term "labyrinth" is generally synonymous, but also can connote specifically a unicursal pattern.  )  The pathways and walls in a maze are typically fixed, but puzzles in which the walls and paths can change during the game are also categorised as mazes or tour puzzles. 

Mammoth<====>20162<====>Mammoth    A mammoth is any species of the extinct genus Mammuthus, proboscideans commonly equipped with long, curved tusks and, in northern species, a covering of long hair.  They lived from the Pliocene epoch (from around 5 million years ago) into the Holocene at about 4,500 years agoin Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America.  They were members of the family Elephantidae, which also contains the two genera of modern elephants and their ancestors.  Mammoths stem from an ancestral species called M.  africanavus, the African mammoth.  These mammoths lived in northern Africa and disappeared about 3 or 4 million years ago. 

Mexican cuisine<====>20167<====>Mexican cuisine  	Mexican cuisine began 9,000 years ago, 7,000 BCE, when agricultural communities such as the Maya formed, domesticating maize, creating the standard process of corn nixtamalization, and establishing their foodways.  Successive waves of other Mesoamerican groups, including the Olmec, Teotihuacanos, Toltec, Huastec, Zapotec, Mixtec, Otomi, and Purépecha, brought with them their own cooking methods. The Mexica establishment of the Aztec Empire created a multi-ethnic society where many different foodways became infused.  The staples are native foods, such as corn, beans, squash, amaranth, chia, avocados, tomatoes, tomatillos, chocolate, vanilla,  agave, turkey, sweet potato, cactus, and chili pepper.

Mummy<====>20224<====>Mummy  A mummy is a deceased human or an animal whose skin and organs have been preserved by either intentional or accidental exposure to chemicals, extreme cold, very low humidity, or lack of air, so that the recovered body does not decay further if kept in cool and dry conditions.  Some authorities restrict the use of the term to bodies deliberately embalmed with chemicals, but the use of the word to cover accidentally desiccated bodies goes back to at least 1615 AD (See the section Etymology and meaning). Mummies of humans and other animals have been found on every continent,  both as a result of natural preservation through unusual conditions, and as cultural artifacts. 

Melilla<====>20226<====>Melilla    Melilla (   ;  ,  ;  ;  , Maliliyyah) is a Spanish autonomous city located on the north coast of Africa, sharing a border with Morocco, with an area of  .  Melilla, along with Ceuta, is one of two permanently inhabited Spanish cities in mainland Africa.  It was part of the Province of Málaga until 14 March 1995, when the city's Statute of Autonomy was passed. Melilla, like Ceuta, was a free port before Spain joined the European Union.   In 2011 it had a population of 78,476, made up of Catholics of Iberian origin (primarily from Andalusia and Catalonia), ethnic Riffian Berbers and a small number of Sephardic Jews and Sindhi Hindus. 

Macaroni<====>20229<====>Macaroni   Macaroni   is a variety of dry pasta traditionally shaped and produced in various shapes and sizes.Made with durum wheat, macaroni is commonly cut in short lengths; curved macaroni may be referred to as elbow macaroni.  Some home machines can make macaroni shapes, but like most pasta, macaroni is usually made commercially by large-scale extrusion.  The curved shape is created by different speeds of extrusion on opposite ends of the pasta tube as it comes out of the machine. In North America, the word "macaroni" is often used synonymously with elbow-shaped macaroni,  as it is the variety most often used in macaroni and cheese recipes. 

Messenger RNA<====>20232<====>Messenger RNA Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a large family of RNA molecules that convey genetic information from DNA to the ribosome, where they specify the amino acid sequence of the protein products of gene expression.  Following transcription of primary transcript mRNA (known as pre-mRNA) by RNA polymerase, processed, mature mRNA is translated into a polymer of amino acids: a protein, as summarized in the central dogma of molecular biology. As in DNA, mRNA genetic information is in the sequence of nucleotides, which are arranged into codons consisting of three base pairs each.  Each codon encodes for a specific amino acid, except the stop codons, which terminate protein synthesis.

Minimal pair<====>20239<====>Minimal pair In phonology, minimal pairs are pairs of words or phrases in a particular language that differ in only one phonological element, such as a phoneme, toneme or chroneme,  and have distinct meanings.  They are used to demonstrate that two phones are two separate phonemes in the language. Many phonologists in the middle part of the 20th century had a strong interest in developing techniques for discovering the phonemes of unknown languages, and in some cases, they set up writing systems for the languages.  The major work of Kenneth Pike on the subject is Phonemics: a technique for reducing languages to writing.
