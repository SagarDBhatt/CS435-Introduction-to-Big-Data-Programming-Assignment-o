Minestrone<====>20242<====>Minestrone  Minestrone ( ;  ) is a thick soup of Italian origin made with vegetables, often with the addition of pasta or rice, sometimes both.  Common ingredients include beans, onions, celery, carrots, stock, and tomatoes. There is no set recipe for minestrone, since it is usually made out of whatever vegetables are in season.  It can be vegetarian, contain meat, or contain a meat-based broth (such as chicken stock).  Angelo Pellegrini, however, argued that the base of minestrone is bean broth, and that borlotti beans (also called Roman beans) "are the beans to use for genuine minestrone". 

Miranda (moon)<====>20254<====>Miranda (moon)  Miranda, also designated Uranus V, is the smallest and innermost of Uranus's five round satellites.  It was discovered by Gerard Kuiper on 16 February 1948 at McDonald Observatory, and named after Miranda from William Shakespeare's play The Tempest.   Like the other large moons of Uranus, Miranda orbits close to its planet's equatorial plane.  Because Uranus orbits the Sun on its side, Miranda's orbit is perpendicular to the ecliptic and shares Uranus's extreme seasonal cycle. At just 470 km in diameter, Miranda is one of the smallest closely observed objects in the Solar System that might be in hydrostatic equilibrium (spherical under its own gravity). 

Mars in fiction<====>20257<====>Mars in fiction  Fictional representations of Mars have been popular for over a century.  Interest in Mars has been stimulated by the planet's dramatic red color, by early scientific speculations that its surface conditions might be capable of supporting life, and by the possibility that Mars could be colonized by humans in the future.  Almost as popular as stories about Mars are stories about Martians engaging in activity (frequently invasions) away from their home planet. In the 20th century, actual spaceflights to the planet Mars, including seminal events such as the first man-made object to impact the surface of Mars in 1971, and then later the first landing of "the first mechanized device to successfully operate on Mars" in 1976 (in the Viking program by the United States), inspired a great deal of interest in Mars-related fiction. 

McIntosh (apple)<====>20258<====>McIntosh (apple)    The McIntosh (   ), McIntosh Red, or colloquially the Mac is an apple cultivar, the national apple of Canada.  The fruit has red and green skin, a tart flavour, and tender white flesh, which ripens in late September.   In the 20th century it was the most popular cultivar in Eastern Canada and New England, and is considered an all-purpose apple, suitable both for cooking and eating raw.  Apple Inc.  employee Jef Raskin named the Macintosh line of personal computers after the fruit. John McIntosh discovered the original McIntosh sapling on his Dundela farm in Upper Canada in 1811. 

Machete<====>20261<====>Machete A machete ( ;  ) is a broad blade used either as an implement like an axe, or in combat like a short sword.  The blade is typically   long and usually under   thick.  In the Spanish language, the word is a diminutive form of the word macho, which was used to refer to sledgehammers.   In the English language, an equivalent term is matchet,  though it is less commonly known.   In the English-speaking Caribbean, such as Jamaica,  Barbados, Guyana, and Grenada and in Trinidad and Tobago, the term cutlass is used for these agricultural tools. 

Mushroom<====>20264<====>Mushroom   A mushroom, or toadstool, is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically produced above ground on soil or on its food source. The standard for the name "mushroom" is the cultivated white button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus; hence the word "mushroom" is most often applied to those fungi (Basidiomycota, Agaricomycetes) that have a stem (stipe), a cap (pileus), and gills (lamellae, sing.  lamella) on the underside of the cap.  "Mushroom" also describes a variety of other gilled fungi, with or without stems, therefore the term is used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some Ascomycota. 

Mainframe computer<====>20266<====>Mainframe computer Mainframe computers (colloquially referred to as "big iron" ) are computers used primarily by large organizations for critical applications; bulk data processing, such as census, industry and consumer statistics, enterprise resource planning; and transaction processing.   They are larger and have more processing power than some other classes of computers: minicomputers, servers, workstations, and personal computers. The term originally referred to the large cabinets called "main frames" that housed the central processing unit and main memory of early computers.    Later, the term was used to distinguish high-end commercial machines from less powerful units.    Most large-scale computer system architectures were established in the 1960s, but continue to evolve. 

Microsoft Excel<====>20268<====>Microsoft Excel    Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet developed by Microsoft for Windows, macOS, Android and iOS.  It features calculation, graphing tools, pivot tables, and a macro programming language called Visual Basic for Applications.  It has been a very widely applied spreadsheet for these platforms, especially since version 5 in 1993, and it has replaced Lotus 1-2-3 as the industry standard for spreadsheets.  Excel forms part of Microsoft Office. FeaturesBasic operation Microsoft Excel has the basic features of all spreadsheets,    using a grid of cells arranged in numbered rows and letter-named columns to organize data manipulations like arithmetic operations. 

Michael Hutchence<====>20269<====>Michael Hutchence    Michael Kelland John Hutchence (22 January 1960 – 22 November 1997) was an Australian musician and actor.  He was a founding member, lead singer and lyricist of rock band INXS from 1977 until his death in November 1997.  He was a member of short-lived pop rock group Max Q and recorded solo material which was released posthumously.  He acted in feature films, including Dogs in Space (1986), Frankenstein Unbound (1990) and Limp (1997).  According to rock-music historian Ian McFarlane, "Hutchence was the archetypal rock showman.  He exuded an overtly sexual, macho cool with his flowing locks, and lithe and exuberant stage movements. 

Motorola 68000<====>20270<====>Motorola 68000  The Motorola 68000 ("'sixty-eight-thousand'"; also called the m68k or Motorola 68k, "sixty-eight-kay") is a 16/32-bit CISC microprocessor, which implements a 32-bit instruction set, with 32-bit registers and 32-bit internal data bus, but with a 16-bit main ALU and a 16-bit external data bus,  designed and marketed by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector.  Introduced in 1979 with HMOS technology as the first member of the successful 32-bit m68k family of microprocessors, it is generally software forward-compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus.After 38 years in production, the 68000 architecture is still in use. 

Minicomputer<====>20272<====>Minicomputer  A minicomputer, or colloquially mini, is a class of smaller computers that was developed in the mid-1960s   and sold for much less than mainframe  and mid-size computers from IBM and its direct competitors.  In a 1970 survey, the New York Times suggested a consensus definition of a minicomputer as a machine costing less than  , with an input-output device such as a teleprinter and at least four thousand words of memory, that is capable of running programs in a higher level language, such as Fortran or BASIC.The class formed a distinct group with its own software architectures and operating systems.

Mechanized infantry<====>20282<====>Mechanized infantry Mechanized infantry are infantry equipped with armored personnel carriers (APCs) or infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) for transport and combat (see also mechanized force). Mechanized infantry is distinguished from motorized infantry in that its vehicles provide a degree of protection from hostile fire, as opposed to "soft-skinned" wheeled vehicles (trucks or jeeps) for motorized infantry.  Most APCs and IFVs are fully tracked or are all-wheel drive vehicles (6×6 or 8×8), for mobility across rough ground.  Some nations distinguish between mechanized and armored infantry, designating troops carried by APCs as mechanized and those in IFVs as armored. The support weapons for mechanized infantry are also provided with motorized transport, or they are built directly into combat vehicles to keep pace with the mechanized infantry in combat. 

Micah<====>20284<====>Micah Micah ( ;  ) is a given name. Micah is the  name of several people in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), and means "Who is like God?" The name is sometimes found with theophoric extensions.  Suffix theophory in Yah and in Yahweh results in Michaiah or Michaihu ( ), meaning who is like Yahweh?  Suffix theophory in El results in Michael ( ), meaning "who is like god". In German and Dutch, Micah is spelled   and the ch in the name is pronounced either   or  ; the first is more common in female names, the latter in male names. 

Malachi<====>20285<====>Malachi  Malachi, Malachias, Malache or Mal'achi ( ;  ) was the writer of the Book of Malachi, the last book of the Neviim (prophets) section in the Hebrew Bible.  No allusion is made to him by Ezra, however, and he does not directly mention the restoration of the temple.  The editors of the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia implied that he prophesied after Haggai and Zechariah ( ;  ,  ) and speculated that he delivered his prophecies about 420 BCE, after the second return of Nehemiah from Persia (Book of Nehemiah  ), or possibly before his return, comparing   with   (  with  ).

BiographyFowler was born and grew up in Walsall, England, where he went to Queen Mary's Grammar School for his secondary education.  He graduated at University College London in 1986.  In 1994 he moved to the United States, where he lives near Boston, Massachusetts in the suburb of Melrose. 

Microsoft Word<====>20287<====>Microsoft Word   Microsoft Word is  a word processor developed by Microsoft.  It was first released on October 25, 1983  under the name Multi-Tool Word for Xenix systems.  Subsequent versions were later written for several other platforms including IBM PCs running DOS (1983), Apple Macintosh running Classic Mac OS (1985), AT&T Unix PC (1985), Atari ST (1988), OS/2 (1989), Microsoft Windows (1989), SCO Unix (1994), and macOS (2001).  Commercial versions of Word are licensed as a standalone product or as a component of Microsoft Office, Windows RT or the discontinued Microsoft Works suite. 

Microsoft Office<====>20288<====>Microsoft OfficeMicrosoft Office is an office suite of applications, servers, and services developed by Microsoft.  It was first announced by Bill Gates on 1 August 1988, at COMDEX in Las Vegas.  Initially a marketing term for a bundled set of applications, the first version of Office contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint.  Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, OLE data integration and Visual Basic for Applications scripting language.  Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the Office Business Applications brand. 

MultiMate<====>20289<====>MultiMate MultiMate was a word processor developed by Multimate International for IBM PC MS-DOS computers in the early 1980s. HistoryWith 1,000 computers, Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance was one of the first large-volume customers for the IBM PC.It hired W.  H.  Jones & Associates to write word-processing software for the computer that would not require retraining its employees, already familiar with Wang Laboratories word processing systems.   W.  H.  Jones' head Will Jones and five other developers created the software.   W.  H.  Jones retained the right to sell the program elsewhere, and WordMate appeared in December 1982. 

Mohammad Najibullah<====>20290<====>Mohammad Najibullah Najibullah Ahmadzai ( ; February 1947 – 27 September 1996), commonly known as Najibullah or Dr.  Najib, was the President of Afghanistan from 1987 until 1992, when the mujahideen took over Kabul.  He had previously held different careers under the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) and was a graduate of Kabul University.  Following the Saur Revolution and the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, Najibullah was a low profile bureaucrat: he was sent into exile as Ambassador to Iran during Hafizullah Amin's rise to power.  He returned to Afghanistan following the Soviet invasion which toppled Amin's rule and placed Babrak Karmal as head of state, party and government. 

Multiplan<====>20292<====>Multiplan  Multiplan was an early spreadsheet program developed by Microsoft.  Known initially by the code name "EP" (for "Electronic Paper"), it was introduced in 1982 as a competitor for VisiCalc. Multiplan was released first for computers running CP/M; it was developed using a Microsoft proprietary p-code C compiler  as part of a portability strategy that facilitated ports to systems such as MS-DOS, Xenix, Commodore 64 and 128, Texas Instruments TI-99/4A (on four 6K GROMs and a single 8K ROM), Radio Shack TRS-80 Model II, TRS-80 Model 4, TRS-80 Model 100 (on ROM), Apple II, and Burroughs B-20 series. 

MOS Technology 6502<====>20297<====>MOS Technology 6502 The MOS Technology 6502 (typically "sixty-five-oh-two" or "six-five-oh-two")   William Mensch and the moderator both pronounce the 6502 microprocessor as "sixty-five-oh-two".   is an 8-bit microprocessor that was designed by a small team led by Chuck Peddle for MOS Technology.  When it was introduced in 1975, the 6502 was, by a considerable margin, the least expensive microprocessor on the market.  It initially sold for less than one-sixth the cost of competing designs from larger companies, such as Motorola and Intel, and caused rapid decreases in pricing across the entire processor market.  Along with the Zilog Z80, it sparked a series of projects that resulted in the home computer revolution of the early 1980s. 

MOS Technology 65xx<====>20298<====>MOS Technology 65xxThe MOS Technology 65xx series is a family of 8-bit microprocessors from MOS Technology, based on the Motorola 6800 (introduced ca.  1975).  The 65xx family most notably included the 6502, used in several home computers, such as the Commodore PET and VIC-20, the Apple II, the Atari 800, and the British BBC Micro. The 6501 and 6502 have 40-pin DIP packages; the 6503, 6504, 6505, and 6507 are 28-pin DIP versions, for reduced chip and circuit board cost.   In the 28-pin versions, the pin count is reduced by leaving off some of the high-order address pins and various combinations of function pins, making those functions unavailable. 

MOS Technology 6510<====>20299<====>MOS Technology 6510   showing the 6510 CPU (40-pin DIP, lower left).  The chip on the right is the 6581 SID.  The production week/year (WWYY) of each chip is given below its name. ]]The MOS Technology 6510 is an 8-bit microprocessor designed by MOS Technology, Inc. , and is a modified form of the very successful 6502. The primary change from the 6502 was the addition of an 8-bit general purpose I/O port (only six I/O pins were available in the most common version of the 6510).  In addition, the address bus could be made tristate. 

Motorola 6800<====>20301<====>Motorola 6800 The 6800 ("sixty-eight hundred") is an 8-bit microprocessor designed and first manufactured by Motorola in 1974.  The MC6800 microprocessor was part of the M6800 Microcomputer System that also included serial and parallel interface ICs, RAM, ROM and other support chips.  A significant design feature was that the M6800 family of ICs required only a single five-volt power supply at a time when most other microprocessors required three voltages.  The M6800 Microcomputer System was announced in March 1974 and was in full production by the end of that year.  "Motorola's M6800 microcomputer system, which can operate from a single 5-volt supply, is moving out of the sampling stage and into full production. 

Motorola 68020<====>20302<====>Motorola 68020 The Motorola 68020 ("sixty-eight-oh-twenty", "sixty-eight-oh-two-oh" or "six-eight-oh-two-oh") is a 32-bit microprocessor from Motorola, released in 1984.  It is the successor to the Motorola 68010 and is succeeded by the Motorola 68030.  A lower cost version was also made available, known as the 68EC020.  In keeping with naming practices common to Motorola designs, the 68020 is usually referred to as the "020", pronounced "oh-two-oh" or "oh-twenty". DescriptionThe 68020 had 32-bit internal and external data and address buses, compared to the early 680x0 models with 16-bit data and 24-bit address buses.  The 68020's ALU was also natively 32-bit, so could perform 32-bit operations in one clock, whereas the 68000 took two clocks minimum due to its 16-bit ALU. 

The Muppets<====>20303<====>The Muppets   The Muppets are an ensemble cast of puppet characters known for their self-aware, burlesque, and meta-referential style of variety-sketch comedy.  Created by Jim Henson and his wife Jane Henson in 1955, they are the namesake for the Disney media franchise that encompasses feature films, television series, music recordings, theme park attractions, print publications, merchandising, and other media works associated with the characters. The Muppets debuted on the television program Sam and Friends, which aired from 1955 to 1961.  After appearing on skits in several late night talk shows and advertising commercials during the 1960s, the Muppets began appearing on Sesame Street in 1969. 

Mole fraction<====>20306<====>Mole fractionIn chemistry, the mole fraction or molar fraction (x i ) is defined as the amount of a constituent (expressed in moles), n i , divided by the total amount of all constituents in a mixture (also expressed in moles), n tot :    x_i = \frac{n_i}{n_\mathrm{tot}} The sum of all the mole fractions is equal to 1: \sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i = n_\mathrm{tot} ; \; \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i = 1 The same concept expressed with a denominator of 100 is the mole percent or molar percentage or molar proportion (mol%). The mole fraction is also called the amount fraction. 

Mary Cassatt<====>20308<====>Mary Cassatt Mary Stevenson Cassatt ( ; May 22, 1844 June 14, 1926) was an American painter and printmaker.  She was born in Pennsylvania, but lived much of her adult life in France, where she first befriended Edgar Degas and later exhibited among the Impressionists.  Cassatt often created images of the social and private lives of women, with particular emphasis on the intimate bonds between mothers and children. She was described by Gustave Geffroy in 1894 as one of "les trois grandes dames" of Impressionism alongside Marie Bracquemond and Berthe Morisot.  Early lifeCassatt was born in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania, which is now part of Pittsburgh. 

Military academy<====>20311<====>Military academy  A military academy or service academy (in the United States) is an educational institution which prepares candidates for service in the officer corps.  It normally provides education in a military environment, the exact definition depending on the country concerned. Three types of academy exist: pre-school-level institutions awarding academic qualifications, university-level institutions awarding bachelor's degree level qualification, and those preparing officer cadets for commissioning into the armed services of the state. HistoryThe first military academies were established in the 18th century to provide future officers for technically specialized corps, such as engineers and artillery, with scientific training.

Macrobiotic diet<====>20318<====>Macrobiotic diet A macrobiotic diet (or macrobiotics) is a fad diet fixed on ideas about types of food drawn from Zen Buddhism. The diet attempts to balance the supposed yin and yang elements of food and cookware.    Major principles of macrobiotic diets are to reduce animal product, eat locally grown foods that are in season, and consume meals in moderation.  Macrobiotics writers often claim that a macrobiotic diet is helpful for people with cancer and other chronic diseases, although there is no good evidence to support such recommendations, and the diet can be harmful. 

Motorola<====>20319<====>Motorola  Motorola, Inc.  (  ) was an American multinational telecommunications company founded on September 25, 1928, based in Schaumburg, Illinois.  After having lost $4. 3 billion from 2007 to 2009, the company was divided into two independent public companies, Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions on January 4, 2011.   Motorola Solutions is generally considered to be the direct successor to Motorola, as the reorganization was structured with Motorola Mobility being spun off.Motorola Mobility was sold to Google in 2012, and acquired by Lenovo in 2014.  Motorola designed and sold wireless network equipment such as cellular transmission base stations and signal amplifiers. 

Mazda MX-5<====>20320<====>Mazda MX-5 The Mazda MX-5, released as the Mazda MX-5 Miata   in North America and as the Eunos Roadster or Mazda Roadster in Japan, is a lightweight two-seater roadster with a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout.  Manufactured by Mazda in Hiroshima, Japan, the model debuted in 1989 at the Chicago Auto Show.  The MX-5 was conceived as a small roadster – with light weight and minimal mechanical complexity limited only by legal and safety requirements, while being technologically modern and reliable.  The MX-5 is conceptually the evolution and spiritual successor of the British sports cars of the 1950s & '60s, such as the Triumph Spitfire, Austin-Healey 100, MG MGA, and particularly the Lotus Elan.

The 68030 was the successor to the Motorola 68020, and was followed by the Motorola 68040.  In keeping with general Motorola naming, this CPU is often referred to as the 030 (pronounced oh-three-oh or oh-thirty). The 68030 features 273,000 transistors with on-chip instruction and data caches of 256 bytes each.  It also has an on-chip memory management unit (MMU) but does not have a built in floating-point unit (FPU).   The 68881 and the faster 68882 floating point unit chips could be used with the 68030. 

Motorola 68040<====>20324<====>Motorola 68040  The Motorola 68040 ("sixty-eight-oh-forty") is a 32-bit microprocessor from Motorola, released in 1990.   It is the successor to the 68030 and is followed by the 68060.  There was no 68050.  In keeping with general Motorola naming, the 68040 is often referred to as simply the '040 (pronounced oh-four-oh or oh-forty). In Apple Macintosh computers, the 68040 was found mainly in the Macintosh Quadra, which was named for the chip.  The fastest 68040 processor was clocked at 40 MHz and it was only used in the Quadra 840AV.  The more expensive models in the (short-lived) Macintosh Centris line also used the 68040, while the cheaper Quadra, Centris and Macintosh Performa used the 68LC040. 

Motorola 68060<====>20325<====>Motorola 68060  The Motorola 68060 ("sixty-eight-oh-sixty") is a 32-bit microprocessor from Motorola released in 1994.It is the successor to the Motorola 68040 and is the highest performing member of the 68000 series.  Two derivatives were produced, the 68LC060 and the 68EC060. Architecture There is an LC (Low-Cost) version, without an FPU  and EC (Embedded Controller), without MMU and FPU.  The 68060 design was led by Joe Circello. The 68060 shares most architectural features with the P5 Pentium.  Both have a very similar superscalar in-order dual instruction pipeline configuration,  and an instruction decoder which breaks down complex instructions into simpler ones before execution. 

Motorola 6809<====>20326<====>Motorola 6809The Motorola 6809 ("sixty-eight-oh-nine") is an 8-bit microprocessor CPU with some 16-bit features from Motorola.  It was designed by Terry Ritter and Joel Boney and introduced in 1978.  It was a major advance over both its predecessor, the Motorola 6800, and the related MOS Technology 6502.  Among the systems to use the 6809 are the Dragon home computers, TRS-80 Color Computer, the Vectrex home console, and early 1980s arcade machines including Defender, Robotron: 2084, Joust, and Gyruss. The 6809 was, by design, the first microprocessor for which it was possible to write fully position-independent code and fully reentrant code in a simple and straightforward way, without using difficult programming tricks.

(Instructions using the Y register have opcodes prefixed with the byte 0x18).  It has two eight-bit accumulators, A and B, two sixteen-bit index registers, X and Y, a condition code register, a 16-bit stack pointer, and a program counter.  In addition, there is an 8 x 8-bit multiply (A x B), with full 16-bit result, and Fractional/Integer 16-bit by 16-bit Divide instructions. A range of 16-bit instructions treat the A and B registers as a combined 16-bit D register for comparison (X and Y registers may also be compared to 16-bit memory operands), addition, subtraction and shift operations, or can add the B accumulator to the X or Y index registers. Bit test operations have also been added, performing a logical AND function between operands, setting the correct conditions codes, but not modifying the operands.Different versions of the HC11 have different numbers of external ports, labeled alphabetically.  The most common version has five ports, A, B, C, D, and E, but some have as few as 3 ports (version D3). Each port is eight-bits wide except for D, which is six bits (in some variations of the chip, D also has eight bits). It can be operated with an internal program and RAM (1 to 768 bytes) or an external memory of up to 64 kilobytes. With external memory, B and C are used as address and data bus.  In this mode, port C is multiplexed to carry both the lower byte of the address and data.ImplementationsIn the early 1990s Motorola produced an evaluation board kit for the 68HC11 with several UARTs, RAM, and an EPROM. The cost of the evaluation kit was $68.11. The standard monitor for the HC11 family is called BUFFALO, "Bit User Fast Friendly Aid to Logical Operation." It can be stored in on-chip ROM, EPROM, or external memory (also typically EPROM). BUFFALO is available for most 68HC11 family derivatives as it generally only depends upon having access to a single UART (SCI, or Serial Communications Interface, in Motorola parlance). BUFFALO can also run on devices that do not have internal non-volatile memory, such as the 68HC11A0, A1, E0, E1, and F1 derivatives.Other versionsThe Freescale 68HC16 microcontroller family is intended as a 16-bit mostly software compatible upgrade of the 68HC11.The Freescale 68HC12 microcontroller family is an enhanced 16-bit version of the 68HC11.The Handy Board robotics controller by Fred Martin is based on the 68HC11. A MC68HC24 port replacement unit is available for the HC11.  When placed on the external address bus, it replicates the original functions of B and C.  Port A has input capture, output compare, pulse accumulator, and other timer functions; port D has serial I/O, and port E has an analog to digital converter (ADC).References External linksFreescale 68HC11 (Legacy) Part InfoWytec 68HC11 Development BoardA fully synthesizable VHDL implementation of the HC11 CPUDigital Core Design 68HC11E - HDL IP CoreDigital Core Design 68HC11F - HDL IP CoreDigital Core Design 68HC11K - HDL IP CoreWin/Linux-based freeware macro cross-assembler (ASM11)4MHz-bus 68HC11F1-based board   

March 21<====>20329<====>March 21In astrology, the day of the equinox is the first full day of the sign of Aries.  It is also the traditional first day of the astrological year.  In the 21st century, the equinox usually occurs on March 19 or 20, being on March 21 only in 2003 and 2007.  The next year in which the equinox occurs on March 21 is 2102. Events537 – Siege of Rome: King Vitiges attempts to assault the northern and eastern city walls, but is repulsed at the Praenestine Gate, known as the Vivarium, by the defenders under the Byzantine generals Bessas and Peranius. 

Merovingian dynasty<====>20333<====>Merovingian dynasty  The Merovingians ( ) were a Salian Frankish dynasty that ruled the Franks for nearly 300 years in a region known as Francia in Latin, beginning in the middle of the 5th century.  Their territory largely corresponded to ancient Gaul as well as the Roman provinces of Raetia, Germania Superior and the southern part of Germania.  Childeric I (c.  457 – 481), the son of Merovech, leader of the Salian Franks, founded the Merovingian dynasty, but it was his famous son Clovis I (481–511) who united all of Gaul under Merovingian rule. After the death of Clovis, there were frequent clashes between different branches of the family, but when threatened by its neighbours the Merovingians presented a strong united front. 

The Morrígan<====>20336<====>The Morrígan   The Morrígan ("phantom queen") or Mórrígan ("great queen"), also known as Morrígu, is a figure from Irish mythology.  The name is spelled Morríghan or Mór-Ríoghain in Modern Irish. The Morrígan is mainly associated with war and fate, especially with foretelling doom and death in battle.  In this role she often appears as a crow, the badb.She is also associated with sovereignty, the land and livestock.  She is believed to be a manifestation of the earth- and sovereignty-goddess,chiefly representing the goddess's role as guardian of the territory and its people. 

Marquette, Michigan<====>20337<====>Marquette, Michigan  Marquette is a city in the U. S.  state of Michigan and the county seat of Marquette County.The population was 21,355 at the 2010 census, making it the largest city of the state's Upper Peninsula.   Marquette is a major port on Lake Superior, known primarily for shipping iron ore, and is the home of Northern Michigan University.  In 2012, Marquette was listed among the 10 best places to retire in the U. S.  by CBS MoneyWatch.  HistoryThe land around Marquette was known to French missionaries of the early 17th century and the trappers of the early 19th century. 

Mary (programming language)<====>20340<====>Mary (programming language) Mary was a programming language designed and implemented by RUNIT at Trondheim, Norway in the 1970s.  It borrowed many features from ALGOL 68 but was designed for machine-oriented programming. An unusual feature of its syntax was that expressions were constructed using the conventional infix operators, but all of them had the same precedence and evaluation went from left to right unless there were brackets.  Assignment had the destination on the right and assignment was considered just another operator. Similar to C, several language features appear to have existed to allow programmers to produce reasonably well optimised code, despite a quite primitive code generator in the compiler. 

Mountaineering<====>20341<====>MountaineeringThe term mountaineering describes the sport of mountain climbing.  While some scholars identify mountaineering-related activities as climbing (rock and ice) and trekking up mountains,  others are also adding backpacking, hiking, skiing, via ferrata and wilderness activities,  and still others state that mountaineering activities also include indoor climbing, sport climbing and bouldering.   However most of the scholars, the term mountaineering understand as a climbing (which now refers to adventure climbing or sports climbing) and trekking (hill walking in 'exotic' places).   Apollo, M.  (2017) The true accessibility of mountaineering: The case of the High Himalaya, Journal of Outdoor Recreation and Tourism, 17: 29–43. 

Megara<====>20344<====>Megara  Megara ( ;  ,  ) is a historic town and a municipality in West Attica, Greece.  It lies in the northern section of the Isthmus of Corinth opposite the island of Salamis, which belonged to Megara in archaic times, before being taken by Athens.  Megara was one of the four districts of Attica, embodied in the four mythic sons of King Pandion II, of whom Nisos was the ruler of Megara.  Megara was also a trade port, its people using their ships and wealth as a way to gain leverage on armies of neighboring poleis. 

Martin of Tours<====>20345<====>Martin of Tours  Saint Martin of Tours ( ; 316 or 336 – 8 November 397) was Bishop of Tours, whose shrine in France became a famous stopping-point for pilgrims on the road to Santiago de Compostela in Spain.  He has become one of the most familiar and recognizable Christian saints, sometimes venerated as a military saint.  As he was born in what is now Szombathely, Hungary, spent much of his childhood in Pavia, Italy, and lived most of his adult life in France, he is considered a spiritual bridge across Europe.  His life was recorded by a contemporary, the hagiographer Sulpicius Severus. 

Meaning of life<====>20347<====>Meaning of life   The meaning of life, or the answer to the question "What is the meaning of life?", pertains to the significance of living or existence in general.  Many other related questions include "Why are we here?", "What is life all about?", or "What is the purpose of existence?" There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.  The search for life's meaning has produced much philosophical, scientific, theological, and metaphysical speculation throughout history.  Different people and cultures believe different things for the answer to this question. 

Margaret River, Western Australia<====>20348<====>Margaret River, Western Australia   Margaret River is a town in the South West of Western Australia, located in the valley of the eponymous Margaret River,   south of Perth, the state capital.  Its Local Government Area is the Shire of Augusta-Margaret River. Margaret River's coast to the west of the town is a renowned surfing location, with worldwide fame for its surf breaks including, but not limited to, Main Break, The Box, and Rivadog.  Colloquially, the area is referred to as Margs, or Margie Rivs.  The surrounding area is the Margaret River Wine Region and is known for its wine production and tourism, attracting an estimated 500,000 visitors annually. 

Maginot Line<====>20351<====>Maginot Line    The Maginot Line ( ,  ), named after the French Minister of War André Maginot, was a line of concrete fortifications, obstacles, and weapon installations built by France in the 1930s to deter invasion by  Germany and force them to move around the fortifications.  Constructed on the French side of its borders with Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and Luxembourg, the line did not extend to the English Channel due to French strategy that envisioned a move into Belgium to counter a German assault. Based on France's experience with trench warfare during World War I, the massive Maginot Line was built in the run-up to World War II, after the Locarno Conference gave rise to a fanciful and optimistic "Locarno spirit". 

Metrication<====>20353<====>Metrication Metrication or metrification is conversion to the metric system of units of measurement.   Worldwide, there has been a long process of independent conversions of countries from various local and traditional systems, beginning in France during the 1790s and spreading widely over the following two centuries, but the metric system has not been fully adopted in all countries and sectors. Overview , seven countries formally do not use the metric system as their main standard of measurement: the United States, Myanmar, Liberia,    Palau, Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Samoa.   However, both Myanmar and Liberia are reportedly essentially metric, even without official legislation. 

Month<====>20354<====>MonthA month is a unit of time, used with calendars, which is approximately as long as a natural period related to the motion of the Moon; month and Moon are cognates.  The traditional concept arose with the cycle of moon phases; such months (lunations) are synodic months and last approximately 29. 53 days.   From excavated tally sticks, researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the Paleolithic age.  Synodic months, based on the Moon's orbital period with respect to the Earth-Sun line, are still the basis of many calendars  today, and are used to divide the year. 

Mozambique Channel<====>20356<====>Mozambique Channel  The Mozambique Channel ( ,  ,  ) is an arm of the Indian Ocean located between Madagascar and Mozambique.   The channel is about   long and   across at its narrowest point, and reaches a depth of   about   off the coast of Mozambique.  A warm current, the Mozambique Current,  flows in a southward direction in the channel, leading into the Agulhas Current off the east coast of South Africa.  ExtentThe International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defines the limits of the Mozambique Channel as follows: On the North. 

Medical psychology<====>20357<====>Medical psychology  Medical psychology is the application of psychological principles to the practice of medicine, primarily drug-oriented, for both physical and mental disorders.  The American Society for the Advancement of Pharmacotherapy defines medical psychology as  "that branch of psychology integrating somatic and psychotherapeutic modalities into the management of mental illness and emotional, cognitive, behavioral and substance use disorders".  A medical psychologist who holds prescriptive authority for specific psychiatric medications and other pharmaceutical drugs must first obtain specific qualifications in Psychopharmacology.   A trained medical psychologist who has prescriptive authority is equated with a mid-level provider who has the authority to prescribe psychotropic medication such as antidepressants for neurotic disorders. 

Music lesson<====>20358<====>Music lesson  Music lessons are a type of formal instruction in playing a musical instrument or singing.  Typically, a student taking music lessons meets a music teacher for one-on-one training sessions ranging from 30 minutes to one hour in length over a period of weeks or years.  For vocal lessons, teachers show students how to sit or stand and breathe, and how to position the head, chest, and mouth for good vocal tone.  For instrument lessons, teachers show students how to sit or stand with the instrument, how to hold the instrument, and how to manipulate the fingers and other body parts to produce tones and sounds from the instrument. 

Mutagen<====>20359<====>MutagenIn genetics, a mutagen is a physical or chemical agent that changes the genetic material, usually DNA, of an organism and thus increases the frequency of mutations above the natural background level.  As many mutations can cause cancer, mutagens are therefore also likely to be carcinogens, although not always necessarily so.  Some chemicals only become mutagenic through cellular processes.  Not all mutations are caused by mutagens: so-called "spontaneous mutations" occur due to spontaneous hydrolysis, errors in DNA replication, repair and recombination. DiscoveryThe first mutagens to be identified were carcinogens, substances that were shown to be linked to cancer. 

Mychal Judge<====>20360<====>Mychal Judge  Mychal Judge, O. F. M.  (aka Michael Fallon Judge, May 11, 1933 – September 11, 2001), was a Franciscan friar and  Catholic priest who served as a chaplain to the New York City Fire Department.  It was while serving in that capacity that he was killed, becoming the first certified fatality of the September 11, 2001 attacks.    Early lifeMychal Judge was born Robert Emmett Judge on May 11, 1933 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of immigrants from County Leitrim, Ireland, and the firstborn of a pair of fraternal twins.  His twin sister Dympna was born two days later. 

Moonfleet<====>20361<====>MoonfleetMoonfleet is a tale of smuggling, royal treasure and shipwreck by the English novelist J.  Meade Falkner, first published in 1898.  The book was extremely popular among children worldwide up until the 1970s, mostly for its themes of adventure and gripping storyline.  It remains a popular story widely read and is still sometimes studied in schools. Plot summaryIn 1757, Moonfleet is a small village near the sea in the south of England.  It gets its name from a formerly prominent local family, the Mohunes, whose coat of arms includes a symbol shaped like a capital 'Y'. 

Merge algorithm<====>20362<====>Merge algorithmMerge algorithms are a family of algorithms that take multiple sorted lists as input and produce a single list as output, containing all the elements of the inputs lists in sorted order.  These algorithms are used as subroutines in various sorting algorithms, most famously merge sort. ApplicationThe merge algorithm plays a critical role in the merge sort algorithm, a comparison-based sorting algorithm.  Conceptually, merge sort algorithm consists of two steps:Recursively divide the list into sublists of (roughly) equal length, until each sublist contains only one element.  A list containing a single element is, by definition, sorted. 

Cuisine of the Midwestern United States<====>20366<====>Cuisine of the Midwestern United States Midwestern cuisine is a regional cuisine of the American Midwest.  It draws its culinary roots most significantly from the cuisines of Central, Northern and Eastern Europe, and Native North America, and is influenced by regionally and locally grown foodstuffs  and cultural diversity.  Everyday Midwestern home cooking generally showcases simple and hearty dishes that make use of the abundance of locally grown foods.  Its culinary profiles may seem synonymous with "American food. " Quoted in a 2007 interview with the Daily Herald, Chef Stephen Langlois, a pioneer in the Midwestern local food movement, described it: "Think of Thanksgiving dinner. 

Mitosis<====>20369<====>Mitosis  In cell biology, mitosis is a part of the cell cycle when replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei.  In general, mitosis (division of the nucleus) is preceded by the S stage of interphase (during which the DNA is replicated) and is often accompanied or followed by cytokinesis, which divides the cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components.   Mitosis and cytokinesis together define the mitotic (M) phase of an animal cell cycle—the division of the mother cell into two daughter cells genetically identical to each other. 

Metabolism<====>20374<====>Metabolism    Metabolism (from   metabolē, "change") is the set of life-sustaining chemical transformations within the cells of organisms.  The three main purposes of metabolism are the conversion of food/fuel to energy to run cellular processes, the conversion of food/fuel to building blocks for proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and some carbohydrates, and the elimination of nitrogenous wastes.  These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments.  The word metabolism can also refer to the sum of all chemical reactions that occur in living organisms, including digestion and the transport of substances into and between different cells, in which case the set of reactions within the cells is called intermediary metabolism or intermediate metabolism. 

Medieval Inquisition<====>20375<====>Medieval Inquisition The Medieval Inquisition was a series of Inquisitions (Catholic Church bodies charged with suppressing heresy ) from around 1184, including the Episcopal Inquisition (1184–1230s) and later the Papal Inquisition (1230s).  The Medieval Inquisition was established in response to movements considered apostate or heretical to Christianity, in particular Catharism and Waldensians in Southern France and Northern Italy.  These were the first inquisition movements of many that would follow. The Cathars were first noted in the 1140s in Southern France, and the Waldensians around 1170 in Northern Italy.  Before this point, individual heretics such as Peter of Bruis had often challenged the Church. 

Microorganism<====>20377<====>Microorganism    A microorganism or microbe  is a microscopic organism, which may exist in its  single-celled form, or in a colony of cells. The possible existence of unseen microbial life was suspected from ancient times, such as in Jain scriptures from 6th century BC India, and the 1st century BC book On Agriculture by Marcus Terentius Varro.  Microbiology, the scientific study of microorganisms, began with their observation under the microscope in the 1670s by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek.  In the 1850s, Louis Pasteur found that microorganisms caused food spoilage, debunking the theory of spontaneous generation. 

Micronation<====>20379<====>Micronation  A micronation, sometimes referred to as a model country or new country project, is an entity that claims to be an independent nation or state but is not recognized by world governments or major international organizations.  Micronations are distinguished from imaginary countries and from other kinds of social groups (such as eco-villages, campuses, tribes, clans, sects, and residential community associations) by expressing a formal and persistent, even if unrecognized, claim of sovereignty over some physical territory.  Micronations are also distinct from true secessionist movements; micronations' activities are almost always trivial enough to be ignored rather than challenged by the established nations whose territory they claim. 

Mining<====>20381<====>Mining  Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth, usually from an orebody, lode, vein, seam,  reef or placer deposits.  These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner. Ores recovered by mining include metals, coal, oil shale, gemstones, limestone, chalk, dimension stone, rock salt, potash, gravel, and clay.  Mining is required to obtain any material that cannot be grown through agricultural processes, or created artificially in a laboratory or factory.  Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water. 

Geography of Myanmar<====>20388<====>Geography of Myanmar   Myanmar (also known as Burma) is the northwestern-most country on the mainland of southeast Asia.   It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. Climate Tropical monsoon in the lowlands below  ; cloudy, rainy, hot, humid summers (southwest monsoon, June to September); less cloudy, scant rainfall, mild temperatures, lower humidity during winter (northeast monsoon, December to April).  Climate varies in the highlands depending on elevation; subtropical temperate climate at around  , temperate at  , cool, alpine at   and above the alpine zone, cold, harsh tundra and Arctic climate. 

Demographics of Myanmar<====>20389<====>Demographics of Myanmar  The following is an overview of the demographics of Myanmar (also known as Burma), including statistics such as population, ethnicity, language, education level and religious affiliation. Population1983 censusAt the time of the 1983 census in Burma, as of 31 March 1983, the population was 35,442,972.   , this was estimated by the CIA World Factbook to have increased to 60,584,650.  Other estimates put place the total population at around 60 million.  China's People's Daily reported that Burma had a census in 2007, and at the end of 2009 has 59. 2 million people, and growing at 2% annually. 

Politics of Myanmar<====>20390<====>Politics of Myanmar    Myanmar (also known as Burma) is a unitary parliamentary republic under its constitution of 2008.  The Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Myanmar as "hybrid regime" in 2016.  Political conditionsMyanmar, formerly called Burma, was a monarchy ruled by various dynasties prior to the 19th century.  The British colonized Burma (Myanmar) in the late 19th century, and it was part of British India until 1937. Burma (Myanmar) was ruled as a British colony from 1824 until 1948.  While the Bamar heartland was directly administered, first as a part of India and then, from 1937, as British Burma, ethnic regions outside the heartland were allowed some measure of self-rule along the lines of the Princely States of India. 

Economy of Myanmar<====>20391<====>Economy of Myanmar   Myanmar (also known as Burma) is an emerging economy with a nominal GDP of $66. 324 billion in 2016 and an estimated purchasing power adjusted GDP of $340. 00 billion in 2016. HistoryClassical eraHistorically, Burma was the main trade route between India and China since 100 BC.  The Mon Kingdom of lower Burma served as important trading centre in the Bay of Bengal. According to Michael Adas, Ian Brown, and other economic historians of Burma, Burma's pre-colonial economy in Burma was essentially a subsistence economy, with the majority of the population involved in rice production and other forms of agriculture. 

Telecommunications in Myanmar<====>20392<====>Telecommunications in Myanmar   Myanmar has begun the liberalization of its telecoms market in 2013.    Telecommunication networks Previously, Myanmar Post and Telecommunication had a monopoly in the country.  In 2013, the government started taking steps to open up the telecommunications market, issuing licenses to new service providers.  In 2014, Qatar-based Ooredoo and Norwegian Telenor Group entered the market, resulting in the reduction of consumer prices and a rapid growth in the number of subscribers, as well as the expansion of the country's infrastructure.   In November 2015, Ericsson named Myanmar the world's fourth fastest-growing mobile market. 

Transport in Myanmar<====>20393<====>Transport in Myanmar  The government of Myanmar (earlier known as Burma) has two ministries controlling transportation:Ministry of TransportMinistry of Rail TransportRoadtotal:   paved:   unpaved:   (2006)The main highways are as follows:1 - Runs from Yangon to Mandalay, passing through Bago, Taungoo, Pyinmana and Meiktila. 2 - Runs from Yangon to Mandalay, passing through Pyay, Magwe, Kyaukpadaung and Myingyan. 3 - Runs from Mandalay to Muse, on the border with China, passing through Lashio. 4 - Runs from Meiktila to Tachileik, on the border with Thailand, passing through Taunggyi and Kengtung. 5 - Runs from Taungoo to Hopong, passing through Loikaw. 

Tatmadaw<====>20394<====>Tatmadaw The Tatmadaw ( ,  ), is the official name of the armed forces of Myanmar (Burma).  It is administered by the Ministry of Defence and composed of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force.  Auxiliary services include the Myanmar Police Force, the People's Militia Units and until 2013 the Frontier Forces, locally known as Na Sa Kha.  Currently, there is no military draft.  Thus, all service personnel are theoretically volunteers, but the People's Militia Law allows for conscription if the President considers it necessary for Myanmar's defence that the provisions of the law be activated. 

Foreign relations of Myanmar<====>20395<====>Foreign relations of Myanmar   Historically strained, Myanmar's foreign relations, particularly with Western nations, have improved since 2012.  Myanmar (also known as Burma) has generally maintained warmer relations with neighbouring states and is a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Europe and AmericaThe United States has placed broad sanctions on Burma because of the military crackdown in 1988 and the military regime's refusal to honour the election results of the 1990 People's Assembly election.  Similarly, the European Union has placed embargoes on Burma, including an arms embargo, cessation of trade preferences, and suspension of all aid with the exception of humanitarian aid. 

Michael Schumacher<====>20396<====>Michael Schumacher  Michael Schumacher ( ; born 3 January 1969) is a retired German racing driver who raced in Formula One for Jordan Grand Prix, Benetton and Ferrari, where he spent the majority of his career, as well as for Mercedes upon his return to the sport.  Widely regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers ever,  and regarded by some as the greatest of all time,   Schumacher is the only driver in history to win seven Formula One World Championships, five of which he won consecutively.  The most successful driver in the history of the sport, Schumacher holds the records for the most World Championship titles (7), the most Grand Prix wins (91), the most fastest laps (77) and the most races won in a single season (13), and according to the official Formula One website, Schumacher is "statistically the greatest driver the sport has ever seen". 

Muonium<====>20398<====>Muonium Muonium is an exotic atom made up of an antimuon and an electron,    which was discovered in 1960 by Vernon W.  Hughes    and is given the chemical symbol  .  During the muon's   lifetime, muonium can enter into compounds such as muonium chloride (  ) or sodium muonide (  ).Due to the mass difference between the antimuon and the electron, muonium (  ) is more similar to atomic hydrogen (  ) than positronium (  ).  Its Bohr radius and ionization energy are within 0. 

Medicine man<====>20401<====>Medicine man  A medicine man or medicine woman is a traditional healer and spiritual leader who serves a community of indigenous people of the Americas.  Individual cultures have their own names, in their respective Indigenous languages, for the spiritual healers and ceremonial leaders in their particular cultures.  The medicine man and woman in North AmericaCultural contextIn the ceremonial context of Indigenous North American communities, "medicine" usually refers to spiritual healing.  Medicine men/women should not be confused with those who employ Native American ethnobotany, a practice that is very common in a large number of Native American and First Nations households. 

Malay Peninsula<====>20403<====>Malay Peninsula The Malay Peninsula ( ;  , , ,  ) is a peninsula in Southeast Asia.  The land mass runs approximately north-south and, at its terminus, is the southernmost point of the Asian mainland.  The area contains Peninsular Malaysia, Southern Thailand, and the southernmost tip of Myanmar. The Titiwangsa Mountains are part of the Tenasserim Hills system, and form the backbone of the Peninsula.  They form the southernmost section of the central cordillera which runs from Tibet through the Kra Isthmus (the Peninsula's narrowest point) into the Malay Peninsula.   The Strait of Malacca separates the Malay Peninsula from the Indonesian island of Sumatra while the south coast is separated from the island of Singapore by the Straits of Johor. 

Miles Davis<====>20405<====>Miles Davis   Miles Dewey Davis III (May 26, 1926 September 28, 1991) was an American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, and composer.  He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th century music.  Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in his five-decade career which kept him at the forefront of a number of major stylistic developments in jazz.  Born and raised in Illinois, Davis left his studies at The Juilliard School in New York City and made his professional debut as a member of saxophonist Charlie Parker's bebop quintet from 1944 to 1948. 

M-theory<====>20406<====>M-theory   M-theory is a theory in physics that unifies all consistent versions of superstring theory.  The existence of such a theory was first conjectured by Edward Witten at a string theory conference at the University of Southern California in the spring of 1995.  Witten's announcement initiated a flurry of research activity known as the second superstring revolution. Prior to Witten's announcement, string theorists had identified five versions of superstring theory.  Although these theories appeared, at first, to be very different, work by several physicists showed that the theories were related in intricate and nontrivial ways. 

Multicast<====>20407<====>Multicast   In computer networking, multicast is group communication Media-communication based on Application-Layer Multicast  where data transmission is addressed to a group of destination computers simultaneously.  Multicast can be one-to-many or many-to-many distribution.   Multicast should not be confused with physical layer point-to-multipoint communication. Group communication may either be application layer multicast  or network assisted multicast, where the latter makes it possible for the source to efficiently send to the group in a single transmission.

Marie Curie<====>20408<====>Marie Curie  Marie Skłodowska Curie ( ;   ;  ; born Maria Salomea Skłodowska  ; 7 November 1867 4 July 1934) was a Polish and naturalized-French  physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity.  She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and only woman to win twice, the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different sciences, and was part of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes.  She was also the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris, and in 1995 became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Panthéon in Paris. 

MATLAB<====>20412<====>MATLAB    MATLAB (matrix laboratory) is a multi-paradigm numerical computing environment.  A proprietary programming language developed by MathWorks, MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, Fortran and Python. Although MATLAB is intended primarily for numerical computing, an optional toolbox uses the MuPAD symbolic engine, allowing access to symbolic computing abilities.  An additional package, Simulink, adds graphical multi-domain simulation and model-based design for dynamic and embedded systems. As of 2017, MATLAB has over 2 million users across industry and academia. 

Meuse<====>20414<====>Meuse  The Meuse ( ;    ; Walloon: Mouze  ) or Maas ( ;  ,   or Maas)  is a major European river, rising in France and flowing through Belgium and the Netherlands before draining into the North Sea.  It has a total length of  . HistoryFrom 1301 the upper Meuse roughly marked the western border of the Holy Roman Empire with the Kingdom of France, after Count Henry III of Bar had to receive the western part of the County of Bar (Barrois mouvant) as a French fief from the hands of King Philip IV.

Mania<====>20419<====>Mania  Mania, also known as manic syndrome, is a state of abnormally elevated arousal, affect, and energy level, or "a state of heightened overall activation with enhanced affective expression together with lability of affect. "  Although mania is often conceived as a "mirror image" to depression, the heightened mood can be either euphoric or irritable; indeed, as the mania intensifies, irritability can be more pronounced and result in violence, or anxiety. The symptoms of mania include heightened mood (either euphoric or irritable); flight of ideas and pressure of speech; and increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and hyperactivity. 

Multimedia<====>20420<====>Multimedia  Examples of individual content forms that can be combined in multimedia Text    Audio   Still images Animation    Video footage   Interactivity   Multimedia  is content that uses a combination of different content forms such as text, audio, images, animations, video and interactive content.  Multimedia contrasts with media that use only rudimentary computer displays such as text-only or traditional forms of printed or hand-produced material. Multimedia can be recorded and played, displayed, interacted with or accessed by information content processing devices, such as computerized and electronic devices, but can also be part of a live performance. 

Max Headroom (TV series)<====>20421<====>Max Headroom (TV series) Max Headroom is an American satirical science fiction television series by Chrysalis Visual Programming and Lakeside Productions for Lorimar-Telepictures that aired in the United States on ABC from March 1987 to May 1988.  The series is set in a futuristic dystopia ruled by an oligarchy of television networks. PlotIn the future, an oligarchy of television networks rules the world.   Even the government functions primarily as a puppet of the network executives, serving mainly to pass laws — such as banning "off" switches on televisions — that protect and consolidate the networks' power.  Television technology has advanced to the point that viewers' physical movements and thoughts can be monitored through their television sets. 

Malaria<====>20423<====>MalariaMalaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease affecting humans and other animals caused by parasitic protozoans (a group of single-celled microorganisms) belonging to the Plasmodium type.   Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches.   In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death.   Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten.   If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later.   In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms.   This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria. 

Lunar phase<====>20424<====>Lunar phase   The lunar phase or phase of the Moon is the shape of the directly sunlit portion of the Moon as viewed from Earth.  The lunar phases gradually and cyclically change over the period of a synodic month (about 29. 53 days), as the orbital positions of the Moon around Earth and of Earth around the Sun shift. The Moon's rotation is tidally locked by Earth's gravity; therefore, most of the same lunar side always faces Earth.  This near side is variously sunlit, depending on the position of the Moon in its orbit.  Thus, the sunlit portion of this face can vary from 0% (at new moon) to 100% (at full moon). 

Metonic cycle<====>20426<====>Metonic cycleFor astronomy and calendar studies, the Metonic cycle or Enneadecaeteris (from  , "nineteen years") is a period of very close to 19 years that is  nearly a common multiple of the solar year and the synodic (lunar) month.  The Greek astronomer Meton of Athens (fifth century BC) observed that a period of 19 years is almost exactly equal to 235 synodic months and, rounded to full days, counts 6,940 days.  The difference between the two periods (of 19 years and 235 synodic months) is only a few hours, depending on the definition of the year. 

March 26<====>20427<====>March 26Events590 – Emperor Maurice proclaims his son Theodosius as co-emperor of the Byzantine Empire. 908 – Emperor Zhu Wen of Later Liang has Li Zhu, the last Tang Dynasty emperor, poisoned. 1027 – Pope John XIX crowns Conrad II as Holy Roman Emperor. 1169 – Saladin becomes the emir of Egypt. 1344 – The Siege of Algeciras, one of the first European military engagements where gunpowder was used, comes to an end. 1351 – Combat of the Thirty: Thirty Breton knights call out and defeat thirty English knights. 1484 – William Caxton prints his translation of Aesop's Fables. 

Marcello Malpighi<====>20428<====>Marcello Malpighi  Marcello Malpighi (10 March 1628 – 29 November 1694) was an Italian biologist and physician, who is referred to as the "Father of microscopical anatomy, histology, physiology and embryology".  Malpighi's name bears to several physiological features related to the biological excretory system, such as the Malpighian corpuscles and Malpighian pyramids of the kidneys and the Malpighian tubule system of insects.  The splenic lymphoid nodules are often called the "Malpighian bodies of the spleen" or Malpighian corpuscles.  The botanical family Malpighiaceae is also named after him.  He was the first person to see capillaries in animals, and he discovered the link between arteries and veins that had eluded William Harvey. 

Momentum<====>20431<====>MomentumIn Newtonian mechanics, linear momentum, translational momentum, or simply momentum (pl.  momenta) is the product of the mass and velocity of an object.  It is a three-dimensional  vector quantity, possessing a direction and a magnitude.  If   is an object's mass and   is the velocity (also a vector), then the momentum is \mathbf{p} = m \mathbf{v}, In SI units, it is measured in kilogram meters per second (kg⋅m/s).  Newton's second law of motion states that a body's rate of change in momentum is equal to the net force acting on it. 

Mood stabilizer<====>20432<====>Mood stabilizerA mood stabilizer is a psychiatric pharmaceutical drug used to treat mood disorders characterized by intense and sustained mood shifts, typically bipolar disorder type I or type II, the borderline personality disorder (BPD) and schizophrenia. UsesUsed to treat bipolar disorder, mood stabilizers suppress swings between mania and depression.  Mood-stabilizing drugs are also used in borderline personality disorder    and schizoaffective disorder. ExamplesThe term "mood stabilizer" does not describe a mechanism, but rather an effect.  More precise terminology is used to classify these agents. Drugs commonly classed as mood stabilizers include:MineralLithium – Lithium is the "classic" mood stabilizer, the first to be approved by the US FDA, and still popular in treatment. 

Mere Christianity<====>20433<====>Mere Christianity Mere Christianity is a theological book by C.  S.  Lewis, adapted from a series of BBC radio talks made between 1941 and 1944,  while Lewis was at Oxford during the Second World War.Considered a classic of Christian apologetics, the transcripts of the broadcasts originally appeared in print as three separate pamphlets: The Case for Christianity (Broadcast Talks in the UK) (1942), Christian Behaviour (1943), and Beyond Personality (1944).   Lewis was invited to give the talks by the Reverend James Welch, the BBC Director of Religious Broadcasting, who had read his 1940 book, The Problem of Pain. 

Mathematical game<====>20434<====>Mathematical game  A mathematical game is a game whose rules, strategies, and outcomes are defined by clear mathematical parameters.  Often, such games have simple rules and match procedures, such as Tic-tac-toe and Dots and Boxes.  Generally, mathematical games need not be conceptually intricate to involve deeper computational underpinnings.  For example, even though the rules of Mancala are relatively basic, the game can be rigorously analyzed through the lens of combinatorial game theory. Mathematical games differ sharply from mathematical puzzles in that mathematical puzzles require specific mathematical expertise to complete, whereas mathematical games do not require a deep knowledge of mathematics to play. 

Martin Gardner<====>20435<====>Martin Gardner  Martin Gardner (October 21, 1914 May 22, 2010) was an American popular mathematics and popular science writer, with interests also encompassing scientific skepticism, micromagic, philosophy, religion, and literature—especially the writings of Lewis Carroll, L.  Frank Baum, and G.  K.  Chesterton.  Martin (2010)   He was considered a leading authority on Lewis Carroll.  The Annotated Alice, which incorporated the text of Carroll's two Alice books, was his most successful work and sold over a million copies.   He had a lifelong interest in magic and illusion and was regarded as one of the most important magicians of the twentieth century. 

MIDI timecode<====>20436<====>MIDI timecode MIDI time code (MTC) embeds the same timing information as standard SMPTE timecode as a series of small 'quarter-frame' MIDI messages.  There is no provision for the user bits in the standard MIDI time code messages, and SysEx messages are used to carry this information  instead.  The quarter-frame messages are transmitted in a sequence of eight messages, thus a complete timecode value is specified every two frames.  If the MIDI data stream is running close to capacity, the MTC data may arrive a little behind schedule which has the effect of introducing a small amount of jitter. 

Mass transfer<====>20437<====>Mass transfer  Mass transfer is the net movement of mass from one location, usually meaning  stream, phase, fraction or component, to another.  Mass transfer occurs in many processes, such as absorption, evaporation, drying, precipitation, membrane filtration, and distillation.  Mass transfer is used by different scientific disciplines for different processes and mechanisms.  The phrase is commonly used in engineering for physical processes that involve diffusive and convective transport of chemical species within physical systems. Some common examples of mass transfer processes are the evaporation of water from a pond to the atmosphere, the purification of blood in the kidneys and liver, and the distillation of alcohol. 

Museum of Jurassic Technology<====>20448<====>Museum of Jurassic TechnologyThe Museum of Jurassic Technology is a museum located at 9341 Venice Boulevard in the Palms district of Los Angeles, California.   It was founded by David Hildebrand Wilson and Diana Drake Wilson (husband and wife) in 1988.   Tony Perrottet, " The Museum of Jurassic Technology: A throwback to the private museums of earlier centuries, this Los Angeles spot has a true hodgepodge of natural history artifacts", Smithsonian, June 2011.  The museum calls itself "an educational institution dedicated to the advancement of knowledge and the public appreciation of the Lower Jurassic";  the relevance of the term "Lower Jurassic" to the museum's collections is left uncertain and unexplained. 

Men at Work<====>20451<====>Men at Work    Men at Work were an Australian rock band best known for their 1981 hit "Down Under".  Formed in 1978, their founding mainstay was Colin Hay on lead vocals; he formed the group with Jerry Speiser on drums and Ron Strykert on lead guitar.  They were joined by Greg Ham on flute, saxophone, and keyboards and John Rees on bass guitar.  This line-up achieved national and international success in the early 1980s.  In January 1983, they were the first Australian artists to have a simultaneous No.  1 album and No.  1 single in the United States Billboard charts – Business as Usual (released on 9 November 1981) and "Down Under" (1981), respectively. 

Meconium aspiration syndrome<====>20452<====>Meconium aspiration syndrome Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) also known as neonatal aspiration of meconium is a medical condition affecting newborn infants.  It occurs when meconium is present in their lungs during or before delivery.  Meconium is the first stool of an infant, composed of materials ingested during the time the infant spends in the uterus. Meconium is normally stored in the infant's intestines until after birth, but sometimes (often in response to fetal distress and hypoxia) it is expelled into the amniotic fluid prior to birth, or during labor.   If the baby then inhales the contaminated fluid, respiratory problems may occur. 

Meconium<====>20453<====>Meconium   Meconium is the earliest stool of a mammalian infant.  Unlike later feces, meconium is composed of materials ingested during the time the infant spends in the uterus: intestinal epithelial cells, lanugo, mucus, amniotic fluid, bile, and water.  Meconium, unlike later feces, is viscous and sticky like tar, its color usually being a very dark olive green; it is almost odorless.   When diluted in amniotic fluid, it may appear in various shades of green, brown, or yellow.   It should be completely passed by the end of the first few days after birth, with the stools progressing toward yellow (digested milk). 

Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits<====>20454<====>Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits  The Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits is a 1936 agreement that gives Turkey control over the Bosporus Straits and the Dardanelles and regulates the transit of naval warships.  The Convention gives Turkey full control over the Straits and guarantees the free passage of civilian vessels in peacetime.  It restricts the passage of naval ships not belonging to Black Sea states.  The terms of the convention have been the source of controversy over the years, most notably concerning the Soviet Union's military access to the Mediterranean Sea. 

Michael Jordan<====>20455<====>Michael JordanMichael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials, MJ,  is an American retired professional basketball player, businessman, and principal owner and chairman of the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA).  Jordan played 15 seasons in the NBA for the Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards.  His biography on the NBA website states: "By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time. "  Jordan was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s. 

Musicology<====>20458<====>Musicology Musicology ( ) is the scholarly analysis and research-based study of music.  Musicology is part of the humanities.  A scholar who participates in musical research is a musicologist.    Traditionally, historical musicology (commonly termed "music history") has been the most prominent sub-discipline of musicology.  In the 2010s, historical musicology is one of several large musicology sub-disciplines.  Historical musicology, ethnomusicology, and systematic musicology are approximately equal in size.   Ethnomusicology is the study of music in its cultural context.  Systematic musicology includes music acoustics, the science and technology of acoustical musical instruments, and the musical implications of physiology, psychology, sociology, philosophy and computing. 

Film promotion<====>20460<====>Film promotionFilm promotion is the practice of promotion specifically in the film industry, and usually occurs in coordination with the process of film distribution.  Sometimes called the press junket or film junket, film promotion generally includes press releases, advertising campaigns, merchandising, franchising, media and interviews with the key people involved with the making of the film, like actors and directors.    As with all business, it is an important part of any release because of the inherent high financial risk; film studios will invest in expensive marketing campaigns to maximize revenue early in the release cycle.  Marketing budgets tend to equal about half the production budget. 

Maggie Out<====>20468<====>Maggie Out "Maggie Out" was a chant popular during the Miners' Strike, student grant protests, Poll Tax protests and other public demonstrations that fell within the time when Margaret Thatcher was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The chant called for her to be removed from that role.  It was referred to, in that context, during a parliamentary session in 1984.  When Margaret Thatcher felt compelled to resign some people had memories of chanting it for thirteen years.    People were passionate about this group activity and associated it with varied political struggles from that time. 

M25 motorway<====>20469<====>M25 motorway   The M25 or London Orbital Motorway is a   motorway that encircles almost all of Greater London, England (with the exception of North Ockendon), in the United Kingdom.  An ambitious concept to build four concentric ring roads around London was first mooted in the 1960s.  A few sections of the outer two rings were constructed in the early 1970s, but the plan was abandoned and the sections were later integrated to form a single ring which became the M25, aka London Ring Road, finally completed in 1986. It is one of the busiest of the British motorway network: 196,000 vehicles were recorded on a busy day near Heathrow Airport in 2003    and the western half experienced an average daily flow of 147,000 vehicles in 2007. 

Mohs scale of mineral hardness<====>20474<====>Mohs scale of mineral hardnessThe Mohs' scale of mineral hardness is a qualitative ordinal scale characterizing scratch resistance of various minerals through the ability of harder material to scratch softer material.  Created in 1812 by German geologist and mineralogist Friedrich Mohs, it is one of several definitions of hardness in materials science, some of which are more quantitative.  "Mohs hardness" in Encyclopædia Britannica Online  The method of comparing hardness by seeing which minerals can visibly scratch others is, however, of great antiquity, having been mentioned by Theophrastus in his treatise On Stones, c.  300 BC, followed by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia, c. 

Murray Gell-Mann<====>20476<====>Murray Gell-Mann Murray Gell-Mann ( ; born September 15, 1929) is an American physicist who received the 1969 Nobel Prize in physics for his work on the theory of elementary particles.  He is the Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Theoretical Physics Emeritus at the California Institute of Technology, a Distinguished Fellow and co-founder of the Santa Fe Institute, Professor in the Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of New Mexico, and the Presidential Professor of Physics and Medicine at the University of Southern California.  Gell-Mann has spent several periods at CERN, among others as a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellow in 1972. 

Magnetopause<====>20478<====>Magnetopause The magnetopause is the abrupt boundary between a magnetosphere and the surrounding plasma.   For planetary science, the magnetopause is the boundary between the planet’s magnetic field and the solar wind.  The location of the magnetopause is determined by the balance between the pressure of the dynamic planetary magnetic field and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind.  As the solar wind pressure increases and decreases, the magnetopause moves inward and outward in response.  Waves (ripples and flapping motion) along the magnetopause move in the direction of the solar wind flow in response to small-scale variations in the solar wind pressure and to Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. 

Magnetosphere<====>20479<====>MagnetosphereA magnetosphere is the region of space surrounding an astronomical object in which charged particles are controlled by that object's magnetic field.   The magnetic field near the surface of many astronomical objects resembles that of a dipole.  The field lines farther away from the surface can be significantly distorted by the flow of electrically conducting  plasma emitted from a nearby star (e. g.  the solar wind from the Sun).  Planets with a magnetosphere, like Earth, are capable of mitigating or blocking the effects of cosmic radiation. 

Manama<====>20481<====>Manama  Manama () is the capital and largest city of Bahrain, with an approximate population of 157,000 people.  Long an important trading center in the Persian Gulf, Manama is home to a very diverse population.   After periods of Portuguese and Persian control and invasions from the ruling dynasties of Saudi Arabia and Oman, Bahrain established itself as an independent nation during the 19th century period of British hegemony. Although the current twin cities of Manama and Muharraq appear to have been founded simultaneously in the 1800s,  Muharraq took prominence due to its defensive location and was thus the capital of Bahrain until 1921. 

Mance Lipscomb<====>20484<====>Mance Lipscomb Mance Lipscomb (April 9, 1895 – January 30, 1976)    was an American blues singer, guitarist and songster.  He was born Beau De Glen Lipscomb  near Navasota, Texas.  As a youth he took the name Mance (short for emancipation) from a friend of his oldest brother, Charlie. BiographyLipscomb was born April 9, 1895.  His father was an ex-slave from Alabama; his mother was half Native American (Choctaw). Lipscomb spent most of his life working as a tenant farmer in Texas. He was discovered and recorded by Mack McCormick and Chris Strachwitz in 1960, during revival of interest in the country blues. 

Melbourne Cup<====>20485<====>Melbourne Cup    The Melbourne Cup is Australia's most prestigious annual Thoroughbred horse race.  It is a 3,200 metre race for three-year-olds and over, conducted by the Victoria Racing Club on the Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne, Victoria as part of the Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival.  It is the richest "two-mile" handicap in the world, and one of the richest turf races.  The event starts at 3pm on the first Tuesday in November and is known locally as "the race that stops a nation".  The Melbourne Cup has a long tradition with the first race held in 1861 over   but was shortened to   in 1972 when Australia adopted the metric system. 

Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet<====>20486<====>Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet   The Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet was a German rocket-powered fighter aircraft.  Designed by Alexander Lippisch, it is the only rocket-powered fighter aircraft ever to have been operational and the first piloted aircraft of any type to exceed 1000 km/h (621 mph) in level flight.  Its design was revolutionary and its performance unprecedented.  German test pilot Heini Dittmar in early July 1944 reached  , an unofficial flight airspeed record unmatched by turbojet-powered aircraft for almost a decade.  Over 300 aircraft were built, but the Komet proved ineffective in its dedicated role as an interceptor aircraft and was responsible for the destruction of only about nine to eighteen Allied aircraft against ten losses. 

Mohamed Atta<====>20487<====>Mohamed Atta  Mohamed Mohamed el-Amir Awad el-Sayed Atta(      ; September 1, 1968 – September 11, 2001) was an Egyptian hijacker and one of the ringleaders of the September 11 attacks in which four United States commercial aircraft were commandeered with the intention of destroying specific civilian targets.  He served as the hijacker-pilot of American Airlines Flight 11 and crashed the plane into the North Tower of the World Trade Center as part of the coordinated attacks.   At 33 years of age, he was the oldest of the 19 hijackers who took part in the attacks. 

Messerschmitt Me 262<====>20488<====>Messerschmitt Me 262  } The Messerschmitt Me 262, nicknamed Schwalbe (German: "Swallow") in fighter versions, or Sturmvogel (German: "Storm Bird") in fighter-bomber versions, was the world's first operational jet-powered fighter aircraft.  Design work started before World War II began, but problems with engines, metallurgy and top-level interference kept the aircraft from operational status with the Luftwaffe until mid-1944.  The Me 262 was faster and more heavily armed than any Allied fighter, including the British jet-powered Gloster Meteor.   One of the most advanced aviation designs in operational use during World War II,  the Me 262's roles included light bomber, reconnaissance and experimental night fighter versions. 

Masuria<====>20493<====>Masuria  Masuria ( ,  , Masurian: Mazurÿ) is a region in northern Poland famous for its 2,000 lakes.  Before the end of World War II, it was mostly inhabited by Polish-speaking (Masurian dialect) Lutheran Masurians and constituted a part of East Prussia.  Masuria occupies much of the Masurian Lake District.  Administratively, it belongs to Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship.  Its biggest city is Ełk, often regarded as its capital.  It has territory of about 10,000 km 2  and population of 59 790 (2013). HistoryOld Prussians Before the 13th century, the territory was inhabited by the Old Prussians also called Baltic Prussians, a Baltic ethnic group that lived in Prussia (the lands of the southeastern coastal region of the Baltic Sea around the Vistula Lagoon and the Curonian Lagoon). 

Magnus<====>20497<====>Magnus   Magnus, meaning "great" in Latin, was sometimes used as a first name among Romans but was not particularly common among them.  The best-known Roman bearing the name was the third-century usurper.  The name gained wider popularity in the Middle Ages, among various European peoples and their royal houses, being introduced to them upon being converted to the Latin-speaking Catholic Christianity.  This was especially the case with Scandinavian royalty and nobility. As a Scandinavian forename, it was extracted from the Frankish ruler Charlemagne's Latin name "Carolus Magnus" and re-analyzed as Old Norse magn-hús = "power house". 

Médecins Sans Frontières<====>20498<====>Médecins Sans Frontières    (MSF) (pronounced  ), also known in English as Doctors Without Borders, is an international humanitarian non-governmental organization (NGO) best known for its projects in war-torn regions and developing countries affected by endemic diseases.  In 2015, over 30,000 personnel — mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators  — provided medical aid in over 70 countries.   The vast majority of staff are volunteers.  Private donors provide about 90% of the organization's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1. 

Moose<====>20501<====>MooseThe moose (North America) or elk (Eurasia), Alces alces, is the largest extant species in the deer family.  Moose are distinguished by the broad, flat (or palmate) antlers of the males; other members of the family have antlers with a dendritic ("twig-like") configuration.  Moose typically inhabit boreal forests and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests of the Northern Hemisphere in temperate to subarctic climates.  Hunting and other human activities have caused a reduction in the size of the moose's range over time.  Moose have been reintroduced to some of their former habitats. 

Medieval warfare<====>20503<====>Medieval warfare  Medieval warfare is the European warfare of the Middle Ages.  Technological, cultural, and social developments had forced a dramatic transformation in the character of warfare from antiquity, changing military tactics and the role of cavalry and artillery.  In terms of fortification, the Middle Ages saw the emergence of the castle in Europe, which then spread to Western Asia. Strategy and tacticsDe re militari Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus wrote De re militari (Concerning Military Matters) possibly in the late 4th century.   Described by historian Walter Goffart as "the bible of warfare throughout the Middle Ages", De re militari was widely distributed through the Latin West. 

Magnetic tape<====>20505<====>Magnetic tape  Magnetic tape is a medium for magnetic recording, made of a thin, magnetizable coating on a long, narrow strip of plastic film.  It was developed in Germany in 1928, based on magnetic wire recording.  Devices that record and play back audio and video using magnetic tape are tape recorders and video tape recorders.  A device that stores computer data on magnetic tape is known as a tape drive. Magnetic tape revolutionized broadcast and recording.  It allowed radio, which had always been broadcast live, to be recorded for later or repeated airing.  It allowed gramophone records to be recorded in multiple parts, which were then mixed and edited with tolerable loss in quality. 

Mabo v Queensland (No 2)<====>20511<====>Mabo v Queensland (No 2)    DISPLAYTITLEMabo v Queensland (No 2) (commonly known as Mabo) was a landmark High Court of Australia decision in 1992 recognising native title in Australia for the first time.  The High Court held that the doctrine of terra nullius, which imported all laws of England to a new land, did not apply in circumstances where there were already inhabitants present – even if those inhabitants had been regarded at the time as "uncivilized".   Consequently, the Court held that the rules of reception of English law that applied were not those applicable where the land was barren and unhabited, but rather the rules that applied where an existing people were settled. 

MeatballWiki<====>20512<====>MeatballWiki  MeatballWiki was a wiki dedicated to online communities, network culture, and hypermedia.    According to founder Sunir Shah, it ran on "a hacked-up version of UseModWiki".In April 2013, after several spam attacks and a period of downtime, the site was made read-only.  FoundingMeatballWiki was started in 2000 by Sunir Shah, a forum administrator from Ontario, Canada, on Clifford Adams's Internet domain usemod. com.MeatballWiki was created as a place for discussion about Ward Cunningham's WikiWikiWeb and its operation, which were beyond the scope of WikiWikiWeb.

Rail transport modelling<====>20542<====>Rail transport modelling  Railway modelling (UK, Australia and Ireland) or model railroading (US and Canada) is a hobby in which rail transport systems are modelled at a reduced scale. The scale models include locomotives, rolling stock, streetcars, tracks, signalling and landscapes including: countryside, roads, buildings, vehicles, model figures, lights, and features such as rivers, hills, and canyons. The earliest model railways were the 'carpet railways' in the 1840s.  Electric trains appeared around the start of the 20th century, but these were crude likenesses.  Model trains today are more realistic.  Today modellers create model railway layouts, often recreating real locations and periods throughout history. 

Morphophonology<====>20544<====>Morphophonology  Morphophonology (also morphophonemics or morphonology) is the branch of linguistics that studies the interaction between morphological and phonological or phonetic processes.  Its chief focus is the sound changes that take place in morphemes (minimal meaningful units) when they combine to form words. Morphophonological analysis often involves an attempt to give a series of formal rules that successfully predict the regular sound changes occurring in the morphemes of a given language.  Such a series of rules converts a theoretical underlying representation into a surface form that is actually heard.  The units of which the underlying representations of morphemes are composed are sometimes called morphophonemes. 

Mirror<====>20545<====>Mirror    A mirror is an object that reflects light in such a way that, for incident light in some range of wavelengths, the reflected light preserves many or most of the detailed physical characteristics of the original light, called specular reflection.  This is different from other light-reflecting objects that do not preserve much of the original wave signal other than color and diffuse reflected light, such as flat-white paint. The most familiar type of mirror is the plane mirror, which has a flat surface.  Curved mirrors are also used, to produce magnified or diminished images or focus light or simply distort the reflected image.

Moveable feast<====>20547<====>Moveable feast A moveable feast or movable feast is an observance in a Christian liturgical calendar that occurs on a different date (relative to the dominant civil or solar calendar) in different years.   The most important set of moveable feasts are a fixed number of days before or after Easter Sunday, which varies by over 40 days since it depends partly on the phase of the moon and must be computed each year.  In Eastern Christianity (including the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, the Assyrian Church of the East, and the Eastern Catholic Churches), these moveable feasts form what is called the Paschal cycle, which stands in contrast to the approach taken by Catholic and Protestant Christianity.

Macro (computer science)<====>20560<====>Macro (computer science)    A macro (short for "macroinstruction", from Greek   'long') in computer science is a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence (often a sequence of characters) should be mapped to a replacement output sequence (also often a sequence of characters) according to a defined procedure.  The mapping process that instantiates (transforms) a macro use into a specific sequence is known as macro expansion.  A facility for writing macros may be provided as part of a software application or as a part of a programming language.  In the former case, macros are used to make tasks using the application less repetitive.

Current Lesser Poland Voivodeship, however, covers only a small part of the broader ancient Małopolska region which, together with Greater Poland (Wielkopolska) and Silesia (Śląsk), formed the early medieval Polish state. 

Man'yōshū<====>20595<====>Man'yōshū The   is the oldest existing collection of Japanese poetry, compiled sometime after AD 759 during the Nara period.  The anthology is one of the most revered of Japan's poetic compilations.  The compiler, or the last in a series of compilers, is today widely believed to be Ōtomo no Yakamochi, although numerous other theories have been proposed.  The last datable poem in the collection is from AD 759 (#4516 ).  It contains many poems from much earlier, many of them anonymous or misattributed (usually to well-known poets), but the bulk of the collection represents the period between AD 600 and 759. 

Mieszko II Lambert<====>20596<====>Mieszko II Lambert   Mieszko II Lambert ( ; c.  990 – 10/11 May 1034) was King of Poland from 1025–1031, and Duke from 1032 until his death. He was the second son of Bolesław I the Brave but the eldest born from his third wife Emnilda of Lusatia.  He was probably named after his paternal grandfather, Mieszko I.  His second name, Lambert, sometimes erroneously considered to be a nickname, was given to him as a reference to Saint Lambert.  Also, it is probable that this name Lambert was chosen after Bolesław's half-brother Lambert.  It is thought that the choice of this name for his son was an expression of warming relations between Bolesław I and his stepmother Oda. 

Mieszko I of Poland<====>20597<====>Mieszko I of Poland Mieszko I ( ; ca.  930 – 25 May 992)    was the ruler of the Polans  from about 960 until his death.  A member of the Piast dynasty, he was a son of Siemomysł, and a grandson of Lestek.  He was the father of Bolesław I the Brave (the first crowned king of Poland) and of Gunhild of Wenden.Most sources make Mieszko I the father of Sigrid the Haughty, a Nordic queen, though one source identifies her father as Skoglar Toste, and the grandfather of Canute the Great (Gundhild's son), and the great-grandfather of Gunhilda of Denmark, Canute the Great's daughter and wife of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor. 

Maggieknockater<====>20601<====>MaggieknockaterMaggieknockater (Magh an Fhucadair in Scottish Gaelic) is a hamlet on the A95 road between Craigellachie and Mulben in Scotland in the Moray council area, in the former county of Banffshire. Until the early 1970s there was large apiary which was well known in the region and has lived on in the Scottish country dance "The Bees of Maggieknockater".   The meaning of Maggieknockater is "field of the fuller" or "plain of the hilly ridge" and has nothing to do with a woman called Maggie.   At nearby Gauldwell Castle (now only with one partial wall left standing) Mary, Queen of Scots, is reputed to have spent the night. 

Mary, Queen of Scots<====>20603<====>Mary, Queen of Scots    Mary, Queen of Scots (8 December 1542 – 8 February 1587), also known as Mary Stuart  or Mary I, reigned over Scotland from 14 December 1542 to 24 July 1567. Mary, the only surviving legitimate child of James V of Scotland, was six days old when her father died and she acceded to the throne.  She spent most of her childhood in France while Scotland was ruled by regents, and in 1558, she married the Dauphin of France, Francis.  He ascended the French throne as King Francis II in 1559, and Mary briefly became queen consort of France, until his death in December 1560. 

Macbeth, King of Scotland<====>20604<====>Macbeth, King of Scotland   Macbeth (nicknamed  , "the Red King";    – 15 August 1057) was King of Scots from 1040 until his death.  He was titled King of Alba during his life, and ruled only over a portion of present-day Scotland. Little is known about Macbeth's early life, although he was the son of Findláech of Moray and may have been a grandson of Malcolm II.  He became Mormaer of Moray – a semi-autonomous lordship – in 1032, and was probably responsible for the death of the previous mormaer, Gille Coemgáin.  He subsequently married Gille Coemgáin's widow, Gruoch, although they had no children together. 

Millbridge, Plymouth<====>20606<====>Millbridge, Plymouth Millbridge is a small neighbourhood of Plymouth, on the boundary of what used to be the towns of Plymouth and Devonport, in the English county of Devon. What was originally a self-standing village (which has now been subsumed within the city) lies to the north of the toll bridge, originally built by Sir Piers Edgcumbe in 1525, that crossed what used to be the Deadlake or Stonehouse Creek, to the west of Pennycomequick, the south of Stoke village and to the east of  Stoke Church.  It derives its name from the old toll bridge (adjacent to a naval saw mill) across the creek between Eldad Hill and Molesworth Road, at one time the principal link between Plymouth and Devonport. 

ML (programming language)<====>20607<====>ML (programming language)  ML ('Meta Language') is a general-purpose functional programming language.   It has roots in Lisp, and has been characterized as "Lisp with types".   It is known for its use of the polymorphic Hindley–Milner type system, which automatically assigns the types of most expressions without requiring explicit type annotations, and ensures type safety there is a formal proof that a well-typed ML program does not cause runtime type errors.ML provides pattern matching for function arguments, garbage collection, imperative programming, call-by-value and currying.   It is used heavily in programming language research and is one of the few languages to be completely specified and verified using formal semantics. 

Messier object<====>20608<====>Messier object The Messier objects   are a set of 110 astronomical objects, of which 103 were included in lists published by French astronomer Charles Messier in 1771 and 1781.Messier was a comet hunter, and was frustrated by objects which resembled but were not comets, so he compiled a list of them,    in collaboration with his assistant Pierre Méchain, to avoid wasting time on them.  In addition to the 103 items published by Messier, seven more are thought to have been observed by Messier and have been added to the list by other astronomers over the years. 

Mambo (music)<====>20609<====>Mambo (music)  Mambo is a musical genre and dance style that developed originally in Cuba.  The word "mambo", similarly to other Afroamerican musical denominations as conga, milonga, bomba, tumba, timba, samba, semba, bamba, bamboula, tambo, tango, cumbé, cumbia and candombe, denotes an African origin, particularly from Congo, due to the presence of certain characteristic combinations of sounds, such as mb, ng and nd, which belong to the Niger-Congo linguistic complex .  In modern Swahili language, the word "mambo" corresponds to the English phrase "Hey, what's up?"  The Oxford Online Dictionary gives "mambo" as Haitian-Creole from Yoruba meaning "voodoo priestess". 

Montoneros<====>20610<====>Montoneros    Montoneros ( ) was an Argentine leftist terrorist and urban guerrilla group, active during the 1960s and 1970s.  The name is an allusion to the 19th century cavalry militias, called Montoneras, who fought for the Partido Federal during the Argentine Civil Wars. After Juan Perón's return from 18 years of exile and the 1973 Ezeiza massacre, which marked the definitive split between left and right-wing Peronism, the president expelled the Montoneros from the Justicialist party in May 1974.  The group was completely destroyed during the Dirty War. IdeologyAs other similar left-wing guerrillas who operated in Latin America during the 1970s, the Montoneros maintained that democracies were a complex masquerade that concealed fascist governments and delayed class struggle. 

Monophyly<====>20611<====>Monophyly In cladistics, a monophyletic group is  a group of organisms that forms a clade, which consists of all the descendants of a common ancestor.   Monophyletic groups are typically characterised by shared derived characteristics (synapomorphies), which distinguish organisms in the clade from other organisms.  The arrangement of the members of a monophyletic group is called a monophyly. Monophyly is contrasted with paraphyly and polyphyly as shown in the second diagram.  A paraphyletic group consists of all of the descendants of a common ancestor minus one or more monophyletic groups.  That is, a paraphyletic group is 'nearly' monophyletic, hence the prefix 'para', meaning 'near'. 

Morphine<====>20613<====>Morphine    Morphine is a pain medication of the opiate variety which is found naturally in a number of plants and animals. It acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to decrease the feeling of pain.   It can be taken for both acute pain and chronic pain.   It is frequently used for pain from myocardial infarction and during labour.   It can be given by mouth, by injection into a muscle, by injecting under the skin, intravenously, into the space around the spinal cord, or rectally.   Maximum effect is around 20 minutes when given intravenously and 60 minutes when given by mouth, while duration of effect is 3–7 hours. 

Mechanical advantage<====>20616<====>Mechanical advantage Mechanical advantage is a measure of the force amplification achieved by using a tool, mechanical device or machine system.  The device preserves the input power and simply trades off forces against movement to obtain a desired amplification in the output force.   The model for this is the law of the lever.   Machine components designed to manage forces and movement in this way are called mechanisms. An ideal mechanism transmits power without adding to or subtracting from it.   This means the ideal mechanism does not include a power source, is frictionless, and is constructed from rigid bodies that do not deflect or wear. 

Marathi language<====>20617<====>Marathi language   Marathi ( ;;  ) is an Indian language spoken predominantly by the Marathi people of Maharashtra.  It is the official language and co-official language in the Maharashtra and Goa states of Western India, respectively, and is one of the 22 scheduled languages of India.  There were 73 million speakers in 2007; Marathi ranks 19th in the list of most spoken languages in the world.  Marathi has the fourth largest number of native speakers in India, after Hindi, Bengali and Telugu, in that order.   Marathi has some of the oldest literature of all modern Indo-Aryan languages, dating from about 900 AD. 

Martin Bormann<====>20618<====>Martin Bormann    Martin Bormann (17 June 1900 – 2 May 1945) was a prominent official in Nazi Germany as head of the Nazi Party Chancellery.  He gained immense power by using his position as Adolf Hitler's private secretary to control the flow of information and access to Hitler.  He succeeded Hitler as Party Minister of the National Socialist German Workers' Party after Hitler's suicide on 30 April 1945. Bormann joined a paramilitary Freikorps organisation in 1922 while working as manager of a large estate.  He served nearly a year in prison as an accomplice to his friend Rudolf Höss (later commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp) in the murder of Walther Kadow. 

Madeline Amy Sweeney<====>20619<====>Madeline Amy Sweeney Madeline Amy Sweeney (December 14, 1965    – September 11, 2001), known as Amy Sweeney, was an American flight attendant killed on board American Airlines Flight 11 when it was hijacked by 5 terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda and flown deliberately into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City, as part of the September 11 attacks. Flight 11On September 11, 2001, Sweeney was asked by American Airlines to take an extra shift because the other crew member, who was assigned to the position, was ill.   Normally, she would only work part-time on weekends. 

Microtubule<====>20621<====>MicrotubuleMicrotubules (  +   +  ) are a component of the cytoskeleton, found throughout the cytoplasm.  These tubular polymers of tubulin can grow as long as 50 micrometres and are highly dynamic.  The outer diameter of a microtubule is about 24 nm while the inner diameter is about 12 nm.  They are found in eukaryotic cells, as well as some bacteria,    and are formed by the polymerization of a dimer of two globular proteins, alpha and beta tubulin.  Microtubules are very important in a number of cellular processes.  They are involved in maintaining the structure of the cell and, together with microfilaments and intermediate filaments, they form the cytoskeleton. 

Militia<====>20622<====>Militia A militia    is generally an army or some other fighting organization of non-professional soldiers, citizens of a nation, or subjects of a state, who can be called upon for military service during a time of need, as opposed to a professional force of regular, full-time military personnel, or historically, members of a warrior nobility class (e. g. , knights or samurai).  Generally unable to hold ground against regular forces, it is common for militias to be used for aiding regular troops by skirmishing, holding fortifications, or irregular warfare, instead of being used in offensive campaigns by themselves. 

Multiprotocol Label Switching<====>20623<====>Multiprotocol Label Switching Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a type of data-carrying technique for high-performance telecommunications networks.  MPLS directs data from one network node to the next based on short path labels rather than long network addresses, avoiding complex lookups in a routing table.  The labels identify virtual links (paths) between distant nodes rather than endpoints.  MPLS can encapsulate packets of various network protocols, hence its name "multiprotocol".  MPLS supports a range of access technologies, including T1/E1, ATM, Frame Relay, and DSL. Role and functioningMPLS is a scalable, protocol-independent transport.  In an MPLS network, data packets are assigned labels. 

Message transfer agent<====>20624<====>Message transfer agent Within Internet message handling services (MHS), a message transfer agent  or mail transfer agent  (MTA) or mail relay is software that transfers electronic mail messages from one computer to another using a client–server application architecture.  An MTA implements both the client (sending) and server (receiving) portions of the  Simple Mail Transfer Protocol .  RFC 5598, Internet Mail Architecture, D.  Crocker (July 2009).  The terms mail server, mail exchanger, and MX host  may also refer to a computer performing the MTA function.  The Domain Name System (DNS) associates a mail server to a domain with an MX record containing the domain name of the host(s) providing MTA services. 

Makran<====>20625<====>Makran Makran ( ) (pronounced [mæk'rɑːn]) is a semi-desert coastal strip in Balochistan, in Pakistan and Iran, along the coast of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. EtymologyThe southern part of Balochistan is called Kech Makran on Pakistani side and Makran on the Iranian side which is also the name of a former Iranian province.Prior to that, in Achaemenid times, the name Maka was used for the region.  The Sumerian trading partners of Magan are identified with Makran.   In Varahamihira's Brihat Samhita, there is a mention of a tribe called Makara inhabiting the lands west of India. 

Micrometre<====>20627<====>MicrometreThe micrometre (International spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures;    SI symbol: μm) or micrometer (American spelling), also commonly known as a micron, is an SI derived unit of length equaling   (SI standard prefix "micro-" = 10 −6 ); that is, one millionth of a metre (or one thousandth of a millimetre, 0. 001 mm, or about 0. 000039 inch).  The micrometre is a common unit of measurement for wavelengths of infrared radiation as well as sizes of biological cells and bacteria,  and for grading wool by the diameter of the fibres. 

Maharashtra<====>20629<====>Maharashtra   Maharashtra ( ;  , abbr.  MH) is a state in the western region of India and is India's second-most populous state and third-largest state by area.  Spread over  , it is bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west and the Indian states of Karnataka, Telangana, Goa, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and the Union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli.  It is also the world's second-most populous subnational entity.  It has over 112 million inhabitants and its capital, Mumbai, has a population of approximately 18 million.  Nagpur is Maharashtra's second capital as well as its winter capital  . 

Mozzarella<====>20632<====>Mozzarella  Mozzarella ( ;  ) is a traditionally southern Italian dairy product made from Italian buffalo's milk by the pasta filata method.  Mozzarella received a Traditional Specialities Guaranteed certification from the European Union in 1998.  This protection scheme requires that mozzarella sold in the European Union is produced according to a traditional recipe. The TSG certification does not specify the source of the milk, so any type of milk can be used.   In Italy, mozzarella made with the milk of the Italian water buffalo is an important variety.  The Italian buffalo mozzarella sold as Mozzarella di Bufala Campana is protected under the EU's Protected Designation of Origin scheme and may only be produced in select locations in the regions of Campania, Lazio, Apulia and Molise. 

Macrinus<====>20633<====>Macrinus   Macrinus ( ;    – June 218) was Roman Emperor from April 217 to 8 June 218.  He reigned jointly with his young son Diadumenianus.  Macrinus was by origin a Berber from Mauretania Caesariensis.  A member of the equestrian class, he became the first emperor who did not hail from the senatorial class and was the first emperor from Mauretania.  Before becoming emperor, Macrinus served under Emperor Caracalla as a praetorian prefect and dealt with Rome's civil affairs.  He later conspired against Caracalla and had him murdered in a bid to protect his own life, succeeding him as emperor. 

Minotaur<====>20634<====>Minotaur In Greek mythology, the Minotaur ( ,;  ,  , Etruscan: Θevrumineś) is a mythical creature portrayed in Classical times with the head of a bull and the body of a man  or, as described by Roman poet Ovid, a being "part man and part bull".   The Minotaur dwelt at the center of the Labyrinth, which was an elaborate maze-like construction  designed by the architect Daedalus and his son Icarus, on the command of King Minos of Crete.   The Minotaur was eventually killed by the Athenian hero Theseus. 

Memex<====>20636<====>Memex The memex (originally coined "at random",  though sometimes said to be a portmanteau of "memory" and "index" ) is the name of the hypothetical proto-hypertext system that Vannevar Bush described in his 1945 The Atlantic Monthly article "As We May Think".  Bush envisioned the memex as a device in which individuals would compress and store all of their books, records, and communications, "mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. "  The memex would provide an "enlarged intimate supplement to one's memory".   .   The concept of the memex influenced the development of early hypertext systems (eventually leading to the creation of the World Wide Web) and personal knowledge base software. 

Modulation<====>20637<====>Modulation   In electronics and telecommunications, modulation is the process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform, called the carrier signal, with a modulating signal that typically contains information to be transmitted.  Most radio systems in the 20th century used frequency modulation (FM) or amplitude modulation (AM) to make the carrier carry the radio broadcast. In general telecommunications, modulation is a process of conveying message signal, for example, a digital bit stream or an analog audio signal, inside another signal that can be physically transmitted.  Modulation of a sine waveform transforms a narrow frequency range baseband message signal into a moderate to high frequency range passband signal, one that can pass through a filter. 

MacOS<====>20640<====>MacOS macOS ( ;  previously Mac OS X, then OS X) is a series of graphical operating systems developed and marketed by Apple Inc.  since 2001.  It is the primary operating system for Apple's Mac family of computers.  Within the market of desktop, laptop and home computers, and by web usage, it is the second most widely used desktop OS, after Microsoft Windows.macOS is the second major series of Macintosh operating systems.  The first is colloquially called the "classic" Mac OS, which was introduced in 1984, and the final release of which was Mac OS 9 in 1999.

The Medallions<====>20645<====>The Medallions The Medallions were an American doo-wop vocal group led by Vernon Green (1937–2000). HistoryThe group formed in Los Angeles in 1954, after Vernon Green was heard singing on the street by Walter "Dootsie" Williams, the owner of Dootone Records.   Green – who walked with a cane as a result of childhood polio – put together a singing group with three friends from Fremont High School, Andrew Blue (tenor), Randolph Bryant (baritone), and Ira Foley (bass), and named them the Medallions because of his own penchant for wearing medallions around his neck.  Biography by Bryan Thomas at Allmusic. 

Morphology (linguistics)<====>20646<====>Morphology (linguistics)   In linguistics, morphology (  ) is the study of words, how they are formed, and their relationship to other words in the same language.    It analyzes the structure of words and parts of words, such as stems, root words, prefixes, and suffixes.  Morphology also looks at parts of speech, intonation and stress, and the ways context can change a word's pronunciation and meaning.  Morphology differs from morphological typology, which is the classification of languages based on their use of words,  and lexicology, which is the study of words and how they make up a language's vocabulary. 

Melting<====>20648<====>Melting  Melting, or fusion, is a physical process that results in the phase transition of a substance from a solid to a liquid.  This occurs when the internal energy of the solid increases, typically by the application of heat or pressure, which increases the substance's temperature to the melting point.  At the melting point, the ordering of ions or molecules in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state, and the solid melts to become a liquid. Substances in the molten state generally have reduced viscosity as  the temperature increases.  An exception to this principle is the element sulfur, whose viscosity increases to a point due to polymerization and then decreases with higher temperatures in its molten state. 

Macroevolution<====>20650<====>Macroevolution  Macroevolution is evolution on a scale at or above the level of species, in contrast with microevolution,  which refers to smaller evolutionary changes of allele frequencies within a species or population.Macroevolution and microevolution describe fundamentally identical processes on different time scales. The process of speciation may fall within the purview of either, depending on the forces thought to drive it.  Paleontology, evolutionary developmental biology, comparative genomics and genomic phylostratigraphy contribute most of the evidence for macroevolution's patterns and processes . Origin of the termRussian entomologist Yuri Filipchenko first coined the terms "macroevolution" and "microevolution" in 1927 in his German language work, "Variabilität und Variation". 

Martin Waldseemüller<====>20651<====>Martin WaldseemüllerMartin Waldseemüller (Latinized as Martinus Ilacomylus, Ilacomilus or Hylacomylus; 11 September 1470 – 16 March 1520) was a German cartographer. He and Matthias Ringmann are credited with the first recorded usage of the word America, on the 1507 map Universalis Cosmographia in honour of the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci. LifeWaldseemüller was born in Wolfenweiler near Freiburg im Breisgau (his mother came from Radolfzell) and he studied at the University of Freiburg. On 25 April 1507, as a member of the Gymnasium Vosagense at Saint Diey (German: Sankt Didel) in the duchy of Lorraine (today Saint-Dié-des-Vosges, France), he produced a globular world map and a large 12-panel world wall map using the information from Columbus and Vespucci's travels (Universalis Cosmographia), both bearing the first use of the name "America". 

Megadeth<====>20653<====>Megadeth  Megadeth is an American heavy metal band from Los Angeles, California.  Guitarist Dave Mustaine and bassist David Ellefson formed the band in 1983 shortly after Mustaine's dismissal from Metallica.  A pioneer of the American thrash metal scene, Megadeth is credited as one of the genre's "big four," along with Metallica, Anthrax, and Slayer, responsible for thrash metal's development and popularization.  Megadeth plays in a technical style, featuring complex arrangements and fast rhythm sections.  Themes of death, war, politics, and religion are prominent in the song lyrics. In 1985, the band released its debut album, Killing Is My Business.

Designed to transport very large semi-submersible drilling rigs above the transport ship's deck, it is equipped with 38 cabins to accommodate 60 people, a workout room, sauna and swimming facilities.  Blue Marlin and her sister ship   comprise the Marlin class of heavy lift ship. HistoryBlue Marlin and her sister ship were owned by Offshore Heavy Transport of Oslo, Norway, from their construction, in April 2000 and November 1999 respectively, until 6 July 2001, when they were purchased by Dockwise. 

Moonie (nickname)<====>20660<====>Moonie (nickname) Moonie is a pejorative term sometimes used to refer to members of the Unification Church.  This is derived from the name of the church's founder Sun Myung Moon,  and was first used in 1974 by the American media.    Church members have used the word "Moonie", including: Moon himself,  President of the Unification Theological Seminary David Kim,  and Moon's aide and president of The Little Angels Children's Folk Ballet of Korea Bo Hi Pak.  In the 1980s and 1990s the Unification Church of the United States undertook an extensive public relations campaign against the use of the word by the news media. 

Mercalli intensity scale<====>20663<====>Mercalli intensity scale  The Mercalli intensity scale is a seismic scale used for measuring the intensity of an earthquake.  It measures the effects of an earthquake.  It is distinct from the moment magnitude (M w ) usually reported for an earthquake, which is a measure of the energy released (sometimes misreported as the Richter magnitude, M L ).  The intensity of an earthquake is not entirely determined by its magnitude.  It is not based on first physical principles, but is, instead, empirically based on observed effects.  The Mercalli scale quantifies the effects of an earthquake on the Earth's surface, humans, objects of nature, and man-made structures on a scale from I (not felt) to XII (total destruction). 

The Mickey Mouse Club<====>20664<====>The Mickey Mouse Club   The Mickey Mouse Club is an American variety television show that aired intermittently from 1955 to 1996 and returned in 2017 to social media.  Created by Walt Disney and produced by Walt Disney Productions, the program was first televised in 1955 by ABC, featuring a regular but ever-changing cast of mostly teen performers.  ABC broadcast reruns weekday afternoons during the 1958–1959 season, airing right after American Bandstand.  The show was revived after its initial 1955–1959 run on ABC, first from 1977–1979 for first-run syndication, again from 1989–1996 as The All-New Mickey Mouse Club (also known to fans as MMC from 1993–1996) airing exclusively on cable television's The Disney Channel, then rebooted in 2017 with the moniker Club Mickey Mouse airing exclusively on internet social media. 

Minos<====>20665<====>Minos  In Greek mythology Minos (  or  ;  , Minōs) was the first King of Crete, son of Zeus and Europa.  Every nine years, he made King Aegeus pick seven young boys and seven young girls to be sent to Daedalus's creation, the labyrinth, to be eaten by the Minotaur.  After his death, Minos became a judge of the dead in the underworld.  The Minoan civilization of Crete has been named after him by the archaeologist Arthur Evans.  By his wife, Pasiphaë (or some say Crete), he fathered Ariadne, Androgeus, Deucalion, Phaedra, Glaucus, Catreus, Acacallis and Xenodice. 

Metre Convention<====>20666<====>Metre Convention  The Metre Convention ( ), also known as the Treaty of the Metre,  is an international treaty that was signed in Paris on 20 May 1875 by representatives of 17 nations.  (Argentina, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Peru, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, United States of America and Venezuela).  The treaty set up an institute for the purpose of coordinating international metrology and for coordinating the development of the metric system.  The treaty also set up associated organizations to oversee the running of the institute.  Initially it was only concerned with the units of mass and length but, in 1921, at the 6th meeting of the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM), it was revised and its mandate extended to cover all physical measurements. 

MAC address<====>20668<====>MAC address A media access control address (MAC address) of a device is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications at the data link layer of a network segment.  MAC addresses are used as a network address for most IEEE 802 network technologies, including Ethernet and Wi-Fi.  Logically, MAC addresses are used in the media access control protocol sublayer of the OSI reference model. MAC addresses are most often assigned by the manufacturer of a network interface controller (NIC) and are stored in its hardware, such as the card's read-only memory or some other firmware mechanism. 

My Neighbor Totoro<====>20669<====>My Neighbor Totoro    is a 1988 Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli.  The film – which stars the voice actors Noriko Hidaka, Chika Sakamoto, and Hitoshi Takagi – tells the story of the two young daughters (Satsuki and Mei) of a professor and their interactions with friendly wood spirits in postwar rural Japan.  The film won the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize and the Mainichi Film Award and Kinema Junpo Award for Best Film in 1988.

Maribor<====>20670<====>Maribor  Maribor ( , German: Marburg an der Drau) is the second-largest city in Slovenia with 94,876 inhabitants as of 1 January 2017.   It is also the largest city of the traditional region of Lower Styria and the seat of the City Municipality of Maribor. NameMaribor was attested in historical sources as Marpurch circa 1145 (and later as Marchburch, Marburc, and Marchpurch), and is a compound of Middle High German march 'march (borderland)' + burc 'fortress'.  In modern times, the town's German name was Marburg an der Drau (literally, 'Marburg on the Drava').  The Slovene name Maribor is an artificial Slovenized creation, coined by Stanko Vraz in 1836. 

Matthew the Apostle<====>20672<====>Matthew the Apostle  Matthew the Apostle (  Mattityahu or   Mattay, "Gift of YHVH";   Matthaios; also known as Saint Matthew and as Levi) was, according to the Christian Bible, one of the twelve apostles of Jesus and, according to Christian tradition, one of the four Evangelists. In the New TestamentAmong the early followers and apostles of Jesus, Matthew is mentioned in   and   as a publican who, while sitting at the "receipt of custom" in Capernaum, was called to follow Jesus.    He is also listed among the twelve, but without identification of his background, in  ,   and  . 

Mehrgarh<====>20675<====>Mehrgarh Mehrgarh (Balochi: Mehrgaŕh;  ;  ;), sometimes anglicized as Mehergarh or Mehrgar, is a Neolithic (7000 BCE to c.  2500/2000 BCE) site located near the Bolan Pass on the Kacchi Plain of Balochistan, Pakistan, to the west of the Indus River valley.  The earliest settlement at Mehrgarh, in the northeast corner of the   site, was a small farming village which was inhabited from circa 6500 BCE.   It is one of the earliest sites with evidence of farming and herding in South Asia.   The site was discovered in 1974 by an archaeological team led by French archaeologists Jean-François Jarrige and Catherine Jarrige, and was excavated continuously between 1974 and 1986, and again from 1997 to 2000. 

Microvision<====>20676<====>Microvision   The Microvision is the first handheld game console that used interchangeable cartridges.  It was released by the Milton Bradley Company in November  .   The Microvision was designed by Jay Smith, the engineer who would later design the Vectrex gaming console.  The Microvision's combination of portability and a cartridge-based system led to moderate success, with Smith Engineering grossing $15 million in the first year of the system's release.  However, very few cartridges, a small screen, and a lack of support from established home video game companies led to its demise in  . 

Mary, Queen of Hungary<====>20677<====>Mary, Queen of Hungary   Mary, also known as Maria (1371 17 May 1395), reigned as Queen of Hungary and Croatia between 1382 and 1385, and from 1386 until her death.  She was the daughter of Louis the Great, King of Hungary and Poland, and his wife, Elizabeth of Bosnia.  Mary's marriage to Sigismund of Luxembourg, a member of the imperial Luxembourg dynasty, was already decided before her first birthday.  A delegation of Polish prelates and lords confirmed her right to succeed her father in Poland in 1379. Mary was crowned "king" of Hungary on 17 September 1382, seven days after Louis the Great's death.

Imagination Technologies is a UK-based company best known for their PowerVR graphics processor family. 

Machine code<====>20683<====>Machine code Machine code or machine language is a set of instructions executed directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU).  Each instruction performs a very specific task, such as a load, a jump, or an ALU operation on a unit of data in a CPU register or memory.  Every program directly executed by a CPU is made up of a series of such instructions.  (The phrase 'directly executed' needs some qualification: machine code is by definition the lowest level of programming detail visible to the programmer, but internally many processors use microcode or optimise and transform machine code instructions into sequences of micro-ops in a sophisticated way. 

Instructions per second<====>20684<====>Instructions per secondInstructions per second (IPS) is a measure of a computer's processor speed.   Many reported IPS values have represented "peak" execution rates on artificial instruction sequences with few branches, whereas realistic workloads typically lead to significantly lower IPS values.  Memory hierarchy also greatly affects processor performance, an issue barely considered in IPS calculations.  Because of these problems, synthetic benchmarks such as Dhrystone are now generally used to estimate computer performance in commonly used applications, and raw IPS has fallen into disuse. The term is commonly used in association with a numeric value such as thousand/kilo instructions per second (TIPS/KIPS), million instructions per second (MIPS), and billion instructions per second (GIPS). 

Michael<====>20685<====>Michael    Michael   is a masculine given name that comes from   (Mīkhāʼēl, pronounced  ), derived from the question מי כאל mī kāʼēl, meaning "Who is like God?".  Patronymic surnames that come from Michael include Michaels, Carmichael, MacMichael, McMichael, Micallef, Michaelson, Mikkelsen, DiMichele, Mikhaylov, Mykhaylenko, Mikeladze, Michels, and Mitchell. ReligionThe name first appears in the Hebrew Bible in the Book of Numbers,   where Sethur the son of Michael is one of 12 spies sent into the Land of Canaan. The archangel Michael features in the Book of Daniel  , and in the Islamic Quran as Mikaeel. 

Modafinil<====>20690<====>Modafinil  Modafinil, sold under the brand name Provigil among others, is a wakefulness-promoting drug  used for treatment of disorders such as narcolepsy, shift work sleep disorder, idiopathic hypersomnia, and excessive daytime sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea.    It has also seen widespread off-label use as a purported cognitive enhancer.   In the United States modafinil is classified as a schedule IV controlled substance and restricted in availability and usage, due to concerns about possible addiction potential.   In most other countries it is a prescription drug but not otherwise legally restricted. Modafinil acts as an atypical, selective, and weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor which indirectly activates the release of orexin neuropeptides and histamine from the lateral hypothalamus and tuberomammillary nucleus, respectively, by unknown mechanisms, all of which contribute to heightened arousal. 

Class (set theory)<====>20696<====>Class (set theory) In set theory and its applications throughout mathematics, a class is a collection of sets (or sometimes other mathematical objects) that can be unambiguously defined by a property that all its members share.  The precise definition of "class" depends on foundational context.  In work on Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the notion of class is informal, whereas other set theories, such as von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory, axiomatize the notion of "proper class", e. g. , as entities that are not members of another entity. A class that is not a set (informally in Zermelo–Fraenkel) is called a proper class, and a class that is a set is sometimes called a small class.

Life and workKaplan was born in Švenčionys, Lithuania, to Rabbi Israel and Haya (Anna) Kaplan.  In 1889, he emigrated to the United States with his mother and sisters to join his father in New York City who was working with the Chief Rabbi Jacob Joseph.  He attended Etz Chaim Yeshiva in Manhattan for a short period.  In 1895 Kaplan attended the City College of New York. 

Mathilde Roth Schechter<====>20701<====>Mathilde Roth SchechterMathilde Roth Schechter (also Matilda; December 16, 1859 – August 27, 1924) was the American founder of the U. S.  National Women's League of Conservative Judaism in 1918.  Schechter was born in Breslau, Prussia  (now Wrocław, Poland).   She was married to Dr.  Solomon Schechter, a prominent rabbi who was chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA).  They lived in Cambridge, England before immigrating to the United States in 1902.  She founded and taught at the Columbia Religious and Industrial School for Jewish Girls.  After assisting Henrietta Szold in creating Hadassah, Schechter later served as its national chairwoman of education. 

MOS Technology<====>20703<====>MOS Technology   MOS Technology, Inc.  ("MOS" being short for Metal Oxide Semiconductor), also known as CSG (Commodore Semiconductor Group), was a semiconductor design and fabrication company based in Norristown, Pennsylvania, in the United States.  It is most famous for its 6502 microprocessor and various designs for Commodore International's range of home computers. HistoryMOS Technology, Inc.  was originally started in 1969 by Allen-Bradley to provide a second source for electronic calculators and their chips designed by Texas Instruments (TI).  In the early 1970s TI decided to release their own line of calculators, instead of selling just the chips inside them, and introduced them at a price that was lower than the price of the chipset alone. 

Margaret Sanger<====>20707<====>Margaret Sanger   Margaret Higgins Sanger (born Margaret Louise Higgins, September 14, 1879 September 6, 1966, also known as Margaret Sanger Slee) was an American birth control activist, sex educator, writer, and nurse.  Sanger popularized the term "birth control", opened the first birth control clinic in the United States, and established organizations that evolved into the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Sanger used her writings and speeches primarily to promote her way of thinking.  She was prosecuted for her book Family Limitation under the Comstock Act in 1914.  She was afraid of what would happen, so she fled to Britain until she knew it was safe to return to the US. 

Mobil<====>20708<====>MobilMobil, previously known as the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company, is a major American oil company which merged with Exxon in 1999 to form a parent company called ExxonMobil.  It was previously one of the Seven Sisters which dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s until the 1970s.  Today, Mobil continues as a major brand name within the combined company, as well as still being a gas station sometimes paired with its own store or On the Run.  The former Mobil headquarters in Fairfax County, Virginia, were used as ExxonMobil's downstream headquarters  until 2015 when ExxonMobil consolidated employees into a new corporate campus in Spring, Texas. 

Mary II of England<====>20709<====>Mary II of England    Mary II (30 April 1662 – 28 December 1694) was joint monarch of England, Scotland, and Ireland with her husband and first cousin, William III of Orange, from 1689 until her death.  William and Mary, both Protestants, became king and queen regnant following the Glorious Revolution, which resulted in the adoption of the English Bill of Rights and the deposition of her Roman Catholic father, James II and VII.  William became sole ruler upon her death in 1694.  Popular histories usually refer to their joint reign as that of "William and Mary". 

Mary I of England<====>20713<====>Mary I of EnglandMary I (18 February 1516 – 17 November 1558) was the Queen of England and Ireland from July 1553 until her death.  She is best known for her aggressive attempt to reverse the English Reformation, which had begun during the reign of her father, Henry VIII.  Her pursuit of the restoration of Roman Catholicism in England and Ireland led to her denunciation as "Bloody Mary" by her Protestant opponents. Mary was the only child of Henry VIII by his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, to survive to adulthood.  Her younger half-brother Edward VI (son of Henry and Jane Seymour) succeeded their father in 1547 at the age of nine.

Marbury v. Madison<====>20715<====>Marbury v.  Madison  Marbury v.  Madison,  , is a landmark case by the United States Supreme Court which forms the basis for the exercise of judicial review in the United States under Article III of the Constitution.  The landmark decision helped define the boundary between the constitutionally separate executive and judicial branches of the American form of government. The case resulted from a petition to the Supreme Court by William Marbury, who had been appointed Justice of the Peace in the District of Columbia by President John Adams but whose commission was not subsequently delivered. 

Mellitus<====>20716<====>Mellitus  Mellitus (died 24 April 624) was the first Bishop of London in the Saxon period, the third Archbishop of Canterbury, and a member of the Gregorian mission sent to England to convert the Anglo-Saxons from their native paganism to Christianity.  He arrived in 601 AD with a group of clergy sent to augment the mission, and was consecrated as Bishop of London in 604.  Mellitus was the recipient of a famous letter from Pope Gregory I known as the Epistola ad Mellitum, preserved in a later work by the medieval chronicler Bede, which suggested the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons be undertaken gradually, integrating pagan rituals and customs. 

M'Naghten rules<====>20723<====>M'Naghten rulesThe M'Naghten rule (pronounced, and sometimes spelled, McNaughton) is any variant of the 1840s jury instruction in a criminal case when there is a defense of insanity: "that every man is to be presumed to be sane, and. . .  that to establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong. 

Mineraloid<====>20725<====>MineraloidA mineraloid is a mineral-like substance that does not demonstrate crystallinity.  Mineraloids possess chemical compositions that vary beyond the generally accepted ranges for specific minerals.   For example, obsidian is an amorphous glass and not a crystal.  Jet is derived from decaying wood under extreme pressure.  Opal is another mineraloid because of its non-crystalline nature.   Pearl, considered by some  to be a mineral because of the presence of calcium carbonate crystals within its structure, would be better considered a mineraloid because the crystals are bonded by an organic material, and there is no definite proportion of the components. 

Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics<====>20728<====>Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics The mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics are those mathematical formalisms that permit a rigorous description of quantum mechanics.  Such are distinguished from mathematical formalisms for theories developed prior to the early 1900s by the use of abstract mathematical structures, such as infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and operators on these spaces.   Many of these structures are drawn from functional analysis, a research area within pure mathematics that was influenced in part by the needs of quantum mechanics.  In brief, values of physical observables such as energy and momentum were no longer considered as values of functions on phase space, but as eigenvalues; more precisely as spectral values of linear operators in Hilbert space. 

Multiple document interface<====>20732<====>Multiple document interface A multiple document interface (MDI) is a graphical user interface in which multiple windows reside under a single parent window.  Such systems often allow child windows to embed other windows inside them as well, creating complex nested hierarchies.  This contrasts with single document interfaces (SDI) where all windows are independent of each other. Comparison with single document interfaceIn the usability community, there has been much debate about whether the multiple document or single document interface is preferable.  Software companies have used both interfaces with mixed responses.  For example, Microsoft changed its Office applications from SDI to MDI mode and then back to SDI, although the degree of implementation varies from one component to another. 

Microlith<====>20734<====>Microlith A microlith is a small stone tool usually made of flint or chert and typically a centimetre or so in length and half a centimetre wide.  They were made by humans from around 35,000 to 3,000 years ago, across Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia.  The microliths were used in spear points and arrowheads. Microliths are produced from either a small blade (microblade) or a larger blade-like piece of flint by abrupt or truncated retouching, which leaves a very typical piece of waste, called a microburin.  The microliths themselves are sufficiently worked so as to be distinguishable from workshop waste or accidents. 

Menorah (Temple)<====>20735<====>Menorah (Temple) The menorah ( ;    ) is described in the Bible as the seven-lamp (six branches) ancient Hebrew lampstand made of pure gold and used in the portable sanctuary set up by Moses in the wilderness and later in the Temple in Jerusalem.  Fresh olive oil of the purest quality was burned daily to light its lamps.  The menorah has been a symbol of Judaism since ancient times and is the emblem on the coat of arms of the modern state of Israel. ConstructionThe Hebrew Bible, or Torah, states that God revealed the design for the menorah to Moses and describes the construction of the menorah as follows ( ):  31 Make a lampstand of pure gold. 

Pointing device gesture<====>20736<====>Pointing device gesture In computing, a pointing device gesture or mouse gesture (or, simply, gesture) is a way of combining pointing device or finger movements and clicks that the software recognizes as a specific computer event and responds in a manner particular to that software.  They can be useful for people who have difficulties typing on a keyboard.  For example, in a web browser, a user can navigate to the previously viewed page by pressing the right pointing device button, moving the pointing device briefly to the left, then releasing the button. HistoryThe first pointing device gesture, the "drag," was introduced by Apple to replace a dedicated "move" button on mice shipped with its Macintosh and Lisa computers. 

Monorail<====>20739<====>Monorail  A monorail is a railway in which the track consists of a single rail.  The term is also used to describe the beam of the system, or the trains traveling on such a beam or track.  The term originates from joining " " (one) and "rail" (rail), from 1897,  possibly from German engineer Eugen Langen, who called an elevated railway system with wagons suspended the Eugen Langen One-railed Suspension Tramway (Einschieniges Hängebahnsystem Eugen Langen).  Colloquially, the term "monorail" is often used to describe any form of elevated rail or people mover.    More accurately, the term refers to the style of track, The term "track" is used here for simplicity. 

Michael Halliday<====>20741<====>Michael Halliday   Michael Alexander Kirkwood Halliday (often M.  A.  K.  Halliday; born 13 April 1925) is a linguist from England who developed the internationally influential systemic functional linguistic model of language.  His grammatical descriptions go by the name of systemic functional grammar (SFG).   Halliday describes language as a semiotic system, "not in the sense of a system of signs, but a systemic resource for meaning".   For Halliday, language is a "meaning potential"; by extension, he defines linguistics as the study of "how people exchange meanings by 'languaging'".   Halliday describes himself as a generalist, meaning that he has tried "to look at language from every possible vantage point", and has described his work as "wander[ing] the highways and byways of language". 

Muslim Brotherhood<====>20742<====>Muslim Brotherhood  The Society of the Muslim Brothers (   ), better known as the Muslim Brotherhood (    ) , is a transnational Sunni Islamist organization founded in Egypt by Islamic scholar and schoolteacher Hassan al-Banna in 1928.   The organization gained supporters throughout the Arab world and influenced other Islamist groups such as Hamas    with its "model of political activism combined with Islamic charity work",    and in 2012 sponsored the elected political party in Egypt after the January Revolution in 2011.  However, it faced periodic government crackdowns for alleged terrorist activities, and as of 2015 is considered a terrorist organization by the governments of Bahrain,   Egypt,    Russia,    Syria,  Saudi Arabia  and the United Arab Emirates. 

Moctezuma I<====>20746<====>Moctezuma I Moctezuma I (c.  1398-1469), also known as Motecuhzomatzin Ilhuicamina ( ), Huehuemotecuhzoma or Montezuma I (   ,    ), was the second Aztec emperor and fifth king of Tenochtitlan.  During his reign, the Aztec Empire was consolidated, major expansion was undertaken, and Tenochtitlan started becoming the dominant partner of the Aztec Triple Alliance. BiographyEarly life and backgroundMoctezuma was the son of emperor Huitzilihuitl and queen Miahuaxihuitl.  He was a brother of Chimalpopoca, Tlacaelel I, and Huehue Zaca; and the father of Atotoztli II, who wed a son of the previous ruler, Itzcoatl. 

Moctezuma II<====>20747<====>Moctezuma II  Moctezuma II (c.  1466 – 29 June 1520), variant spellings include Montezuma, Moteuczoma, Motecuhzoma, Motēuczōmah, and referred to in full by early Nahuatl texts as Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin (Moctezuma the Young,  ),    was the ninth tlatoani or ruler of Tenochtitlan, reigning from 1502 to 1520.  The first contact between indigenous civilizations of Mesoamerica and Europeans took place during his reign, and he was killed during the initial stages of the Spanish conquest of Mexico, when conquistador Hernán Cortés and his men fought to escape from the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan. During his reign the Aztec Empire reached its greatest size. 

Mustafa Altıoklar<====>20751<====>Mustafa AltıoklarMustafa Altıoklar (born 1958, Ankara) is a Turkish film director, producer and screenwriter. He was born in Ankara, Turkey in 1958.  He is Georgian descent by his mother, her family which migrated from Batumi to Ünye.His childhood house overlooked a projection room, owned by the Board of Censors, where the members of the board were cutting the films.  As the cutter threw away film pieces out of the window, Altioklar and his friends were eagerly waiting for them outside the window of the projection room.  That was his first meeting with the art of light and images. 

Mickey Hart<====>20756<====>Mickey Hart  Mickey Hart (born Michael Steven Hartman, September 11, 1943) is an American percussionist and musicologist.  He is best known as one of the two drummers of the rock band Grateful Dead.  He was a member of the Grateful Dead from September 1967 until the group disbanded in August 1995.  He and fellow Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann earned the nickname "the rhythm devils". Early life and educationMichael Steven Hartman was born in Flatbush, Brooklyn.  He was raised in Inwood, New York by his mother, Leah, a drummer, gown maker and bookkeeper.

He came from a family of scientists in which his father is a physicist and his mother a biologist.   He started writing free software in 1992. Early software careerOne of the earliest pieces of software he wrote for Linux was the Midnight Commander file manager, a text-mode file manager. 

Major scale<====>20759<====>Major scale The major scale or Ionian scale is one of the most commonly used musical scales, especially in Western music.  It is one of the diatonic scales.  Like many musical scales, it is made up of seven notes: the eighth duplicates the first at double its frequency so that it is called a higher octave of the same note (from Latin "octavus", the eighth). The simplest major scale to write is C major, the only major scale not requiring sharps or flats:C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C ( )The major scale had a central importance in European music, particularly in the common practice period and in popular music, owing to the large number of chords that can be formed from it. 

Montenegro<====>20760<====>Montenegro Montenegro (   ; Montenegrin: Crna Gora/Црна Гора,  , meaning "Black Mountain") is a sovereign state in Southeastern Europe.  It has a coast on the Adriatic Sea to the southwest and is bordered by Croatia to the west, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest, Serbia to the northeast, Kosovo  to the east, and Albania to the southeast.   Its capital and largest city is Podgorica, while Cetinje is designated as the Old Royal Capital (prijestonica).  In the 9th century, three Serb principalities were located on the territory of Montenegro: Duklja, roughly corresponding to the southern half; Travunia, the west; and Rascia, the north. 

Michael Crichton<====>20762<====>Michael Crichton   John Michael Crichton ( ; October 23, 1942 – November 4, 2008) was an American author, screenwriter, film director and producer best known for his work in the science fiction, thriller, and medical fiction genres.  His books have sold over 200 million copies worldwide, and over a dozen have been adapted into films. His literary works are usually within the action genre and heavily feature technology.  His novels epitomize the techno-thriller genre of literature, often exploring technology and failures of human interaction with it, especially resulting in catastrophes with biotechnology.  Many of his future history novels have medical or scientific underpinnings, reflecting his medical training and science background. 

Minor scale<====>20765<====>Minor scale  In music theory, minor scale may refer to:a heptatonic scale whose first, third, and fifth scale degrees form a minor triad,  that is, a seven-note scale in which the third note is a minor third (three semitones) above the first, and the fifth note is a perfect fifth (seven semitones) above the first.  This includes (among others) the natural minor, harmonic minor, and melodic minor scales.   A minor scale differs from a major scale in that the third degree in a major scale is a major third (four semitones) above the first degree. 

Menachem Begin<====>20767<====>Menachem Begin    Menachem Begin ( ;   Menaḥem Begin,  ;   Menakhem Volfovich Begin; 16 August 1913 – 9 March 1992) was an Israeli politician, founder of Likud and the sixth Prime Minister of Israel.  Before the creation of the state of Israel, he was the leader of the Zionist militant group Irgun, the Revisionist breakaway from the larger Jewish paramilitary organization Haganah.  He proclaimed a revolt, on 1 February 1944, against the British mandatory government, which was opposed by the Jewish Agency.  As head of the Irgun, he targeted the British in Palestine. 

Mergers and acquisitions<====>20769<====>Mergers and acquisitions    Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are transactions in which the ownership of companies, other business organizations or their operating units are transferred or combined.  As an aspect of strategic management, M&A can allow enterprises to grow, shrink, and change the nature of their business or competitive position. From a legal point of view, a merger is a legal consolidation of two entities into one entity, whereas an acquisition occurs when one entity takes ownership of another entity's stock, equity interests or assets.  From a commercial and economic point of view, both types of transactions generally result in the consolidation of assets and liabilities under one entity, and the distinction between a "merger" and an "acquisition" is less clear. 

United States v. Microsoft Corp.<====>20770<====>United States v.  Microsoft Corp. United States v.  Microsoft Corporation 253 F. 3d 34 (D. C.  Cir.  2001) is a U. S.  antitrust law case, ultimately settled by the Department of Justice, where Microsoft Corporation was accused of becoming a monopoly and engaging in anti-competitive practices contrary to the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act sections 1 and 2. It was initiated on May 18, 1998 by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and 20 states.   Joel I.  Klein was the lead prosecutor. The plaintiffs alleged that Microsoft abused monopoly power on Intel-based personal computers in its handling of operating system and web browser sales (for at the time web browsers were not freeware, but payware). 

Mercator projection<====>20771<====>Mercator projectionThe Mercator projection is a cylindrical map projection presented by the Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569.  It became the standard map projection for nautical purposes because of its ability to represent lines of constant course, known as rhumb lines or loxodromes, as straight segments that conserve the angles with the meridians.  Although the linear scale is equal in all directions around any point, thus preserving the angles and the shapes of small objects (which makes the projection conformal), the Mercator projection distorts the size of objects as the latitude increases from the Equator to the poles, where the scale becomes infinite. 

Midas<====>20775<====>Midas   Midas ( ;  ) is the name of at least three members of the royal house of Phrygia. The most famous King Midas is popularly remembered in Greek mythology for his ability to turn everything he touched into gold.  This came to be called the golden touch, or the Midas touch.   The Phrygian city Midaeum was presumably named after this Midas, and this is probably also the Midas that according to Pausanias founded Ancyra.   According to Aristotle, legend held that Midas died of starvation as a result of his "vain prayer" for the gold touch. 

Misandry<====>20778<====>Misandry   Misandry ( ) is the hatred of, contempt for, or prejudice against men or boys.  It is parallel in form to misogyny, and either "misandrous" or "misandristic" can be used as adjective forms of the word.   Misandry can manifest itself in numerous ways, including sexual discrimination, denigration of men, violence against men, sexual objectification of men, "or more broadly, the hatred, fear, anger and contempt of men".  OriginsMisandry is parallel in form to 'misogyny', and is formed from the Greek misos (μῖσος, "hatred") and anēr, andros (ἀνήρ, gen. 

Monoid ring<====>20781<====>Monoid ringIn abstract algebra, a monoid ring is a ring constructed from a ring and a monoid, just as a group ring is constructed from a ring and a group. DefinitionLet R be a ring and let G be a monoid.   The monoid ring or monoid algebra of G over R, denoted R[G] or RG, is the set of formal sums  \sum_{g \in G} r_g g ,where  r_g \in R  for each  g \in G  and r g  = 0 for all but finitely many g, equipped with coefficient-wise addition, and the multiplication in which the elements of R commute with the elements of G. 

Magic lantern<====>20783<====>Magic lantern  The magic lantern, also known by its Latin name lanterna magica, is an early type of image projector employing pictures painted, printed or produced photographically on transparent plates (usually made of glass), one or more lenses, and a light source.  It was mostly developed in the 17th century and commonly used for entertainment purposes.  It was increasingly applied to educational purposes during the 19th century.  Since the late 19th century smaller versions were also mass-produced as a toy for children.  The magic lantern was in wide use from the 18th century until the mid-20th century, when it was superseded by a compact version that could hold many 35 mm photographic slides: the slide projector. 

Mulholland Drive (film)<====>20786<====>Mulholland Drive (film)  Mulholland Drive (stylized as Mulholland Dr. ) is a 2001 American neo-noir mystery film written and directed by David Lynch and starring Naomi Watts, Laura Harring, Justin Theroux, Ann Miller, and Robert Forster.  It tells the story of an aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts), newly arrived in Los Angeles, who meets and befriends an amnesiac woman (Harring) hiding in an apartment which belongs to Betty's aunt.  The story includes several other seemingly unrelated vignettes that eventually interlock, as well as some surreal and darkly comedic scenes and images that relate to the cryptic narrative. 

Mary Magdalene<====>20787<====>Mary Magdalene  Saint Mary Magdalene (   , original Biblical  , literally "Mary the Magdalene"), Μαρία η Μαγδαληνή in Matt 27:56; 27:61; 28:1;  ;  ;  ;   replaces "η" with "τη" because of the case change.    says "Μαρία . . .  η Μαγδαληνή" and   says "η Μαγδαληνή Μαρία".    , 20:1 and 20:18 all say "Μαρία η Μαγδαληνή".   sometimes called simply the Magdalene, was a Jewish woman who, according to texts included in the New Testament, traveled with Jesus as one of his followers. 

Mary of Bethany<====>20788<====>Mary of Bethany Mary of Bethany (Judeo-Aramaic מרים, Maryām, rendered Μαρία, Maria, in the Koine Greek of the New Testament; form of Hebrew מִרְיָם, Miryām, or Miriam, "wished for child", "bitter" or "rebellious") is a biblical figure described in the Gospels of John and Luke in the Christian New Testament.   Together with her siblings Lazarus and Martha, she is described by John as living in the village of Bethany near Jerusalem; in Luke only the two sisters, living in an unnamed village, are mentioned.   Most Christian commentators have been ready to assume that the two sets of sisters named as Mary and Martha are the same, though this is not conclusively stated in the Gospels, and the proliferation of New Testament "Marys" is notorious. 

Mary of Rome<====>20789<====>Mary of RomePaul the Apostle's Epistle to the Romans (16:6) mentions a Mary. She is said to have treated Paul with special kindness, and to have "laboured much among" the early Christian community.Although it has been conjectured that she is the same person as the Mary mother of John Mark  , this is generally considered to be unproven  . Most traditions hold that there is nothing more known about her.  Who was Who in the Bible,  , p255 See alsoMary, for other famous people named Mary.References  

Mary, mother of John Mark<====>20790<====>Mary, mother of John MarkMary, mother of John Mark is mentioned in the  , which says that, after his escape from prison, Peter went to her house:  When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.   This seems to be the only mention of her in the Bible. The question whether her son John Mark can be identified with others called Mark or John in the New Testament is discussed in the article about him.  Greek scholars reject his identification with Mark the Evangelist and have a separate feast for John Mark in their synaxarion. 

Malcolm X<====>20796<====>Malcolm X Malcolm X( 1925   1965 )  was an African-American Muslim minister and human rights activist.  To his admirers he was a courageous advocate for the rights of blacks, a man who indicted white America in the harshest terms for its crimes against black Americans; detractors accused him of preaching racism and violence.  He has been called one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history.  His father was killed when he was six and his mother was placed in a mental hospital when he was thirteen, after which he lived in a series of foster homes. 

MusicBrainz<====>20797<====>MusicBrainz MusicBrainz is a project that aims to create an open data music database that is similar to the freedb project.  MusicBrainz was founded in response to the restrictions placed on the Compact Disc Database (CDDB), a database for software applications to look up audio CD (compact disc) information on the Internet.  MusicBrainz has expanded its goals to reach beyond a compact disc metadata (this is information about the performers, artists, songwriters, etc. ) storehouse to become a structured open online database for music.   MusicBrainz captures information about artists, their recorded works, and the relationships between them. 

Mennonite<====>20798<====>Mennonite  The Mennonites are Christian groups belonging to the church communities of Anabaptist denominations named after Menno Simons (1496–1561) of Friesland (which today is a province of the Netherlands).  Through his writings, Simons articulated and formalized the teachings of earlier Swiss founders.  The early teachings of the Mennonites were founded on the belief in both the mission and ministry of Jesus, which the original Anabaptist followers held to with great conviction despite persecution by the various Roman Catholic and Protestant states.  Rather than fight, the majority of these followers survived by fleeing to neighboring states where ruling families were tolerant of their belief in believer's baptism. 

MMIX<====>20799<====>MMIX  MMIX (pronounced em-mix) is a 64-bit reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architecture designed by Donald Knuth, with significant contributions by John L.  Hennessy (who contributed to the design of the MIPS architecture) and Richard L.  Sites (who was an architect of the Alpha architecture).  Knuth has said that "MMIX is a computer intended to illustrate machine-level aspects of programming.  In my books The Art of Computer Programming, it replaces MIX, the 1960s-style machine that formerly played such a role… I strove to design MMIX so that its machine language would be simple, elegant, and easy to learn. 

Maastricht Treaty<====>20803<====>Maastricht Treaty   The Maastricht Treaty ( ; formally, the Treaty on European Union or TEU) undertaken to integrate Europe was signed on 7 February 1992 by the members of the European Community in Maastricht, Netherlands.On 9–10 December 1991, the same city hosted the European Council which drafted the treaty.   Upon its entry into force on 1 November 1993 during the Delors Commission,  it created the three pillars structure of the European Union and led to the creation of the single European currency, the euro.  TEU comprised two novel titles respectively on Common Foreign and Security Policy and Cooperation in the Fields of Justice and Home Affairs, which replaced the former informal intergovernmental cooperation bodies named TREVI and European Political Cooperation on EU Foreign policy coordination. 

Magdeburg<====>20804<====>Magdeburg  Magdeburg ( ; Low Saxon: Meideborg,  ) is the capital city and the largest city of the state of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.  Magdeburg is situated on the Elbe River and was one of the most important medieval cities of Europe. Otto I, the first Holy Roman Emperor and founder of the archbishopric of Magdeburg, was buried in the town's cathedral after his death.  Magdeburg's version of German town law, known as Magdeburg rights, spread throughout Central and Eastern Europe.  The city is also well known for the Sack of Magdeburg, which sparked outrage across the Protestant world and became the worst massacre of the Thirty Years' War. 

Motet<====>20805<====>Motet  In western music, a motet is a mainly vocal musical composition, of highly varied form and style, from the late medieval era to the present.  The motet was one of the pre-eminent polyphonic forms of Renaissance music.  According to Margaret Bent, "a piece of music in several parts with words" is as precise a definition of the motet as will serve from the 13th to the late 16th century and beyond.  Margaret Bent, "The Late-Medieval Motet" in Companion to Medieval & Renaissance Music, edited by Tess Knighton and David Fallows, 114–19 (Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1992): 114. 

Merlin<====>20807<====>MerlinMerlin ( ) is a legendary figure best known as the wizard featured in Arthurian legend and medieval Welsh poetry.  The standard depiction of the character first appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, written c.  1136, and is based on an amalgamation of previous historical and legendary figures.  Geoffrey combined existing stories of Myrddin Wyllt (Merlinus Caledonensis), a North Brythonic prophet and madman with no connection to King Arthur, with tales of the Romano-British war leader Ambrosius Aurelianus to form the composite figure he called Merlin Ambrosius ( ).  He is allegedly buried in the Broceliande forest, near Paimpont in Brittany. 

Merchant<====>20810<====>Merchant A merchant is a person who trades in commodities produced by other people.  A merchant historically was anyone who was involved in business as long as industry, commerce, and trade have existed.  The status of the merchant has varied during different periods of history and among different societies.  In modern times, the term occasionally has been used to refer to a businessperson or someone undertaking activities (commercial or industrial) for the purpose of generating profit, cash flow, sales, and revenue utilizing a combination of human, financial, intellectual and physical capital with a view to fueling economic development and growth. 

Michael Milken<====>20813<====>Michael Milken  Michael Robert Milken (born July 4, 1946) is an American former financier and philanthropist.  He is noted for his role in the development of the market for high-yield bonds ("junk bonds")  for his conviction following a guilty plea on felony charges for violating U. S.  securities laws and his charitable giving. Milken was indicted for racketeering and securities fraud in 1989 in an insider trading investigation.   As the result of a plea bargain, he pleaded guilty to securities and reporting violations but not to racketeering or insider trading.  Milken was sentenced to ten years in prison, fined $600 million, and permanently barred from the securities industry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Mentat<====>20814<====>Mentat  A Mentat is a fictional type of human, presented in Frank Herbert's science fiction Dune universe.  In an interstellar society that fears a resurgence of artificial intelligence and thus prohibits computers, Mentats are specially trained to mimic the cognitive and analytical ability of electronic computers. OverviewIn Herbert's fiction, the Butlerian Jihad results in the strict prohibition of all thinking machines, including computers, robots and artificial intelligence of any kind.  This is a key influence on the nature of Herbert's fictional setting.   The Mentat discipline is developed as a replacement for computerized calculation, just as the Bene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild take on functions previously performed by thinking machines. 

Mayerling<====>20815<====>Mayerling Mayerling is a small village (pop.  200) in Lower Austria belonging to the municipality of Alland in the district of Baden.  It is situated on the Schwechat river, in the Wienerwald (Vienna woods), 15 miles (24 km) southwest of Vienna.  From 1550, it was in the possession of the abbey of Heiligenkreuz. The Mayerling incident In 1886, Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria, only son of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria and Empress Elisabeth, and heir to the Austro-Hungarian crown, acquired the manor and transformed it into a hunting lodge.  It was in this hunting lodge that, on 30 January 1889, he was found dead with his mistress, Baroness Mary Vetsera, apparently as a result of suicide. 

Musical keyboard<====>20816<====>Musical keyboard A musical keyboard is the set of adjacent depressible levers or keys on a musical instrument.  Keyboards typically contain keys for playing the twelve notes of the Western musical scale, with a combination of larger, longer keys and smaller, shorter keys that repeats at the interval of an octave.  Depressing a key on the keyboard causes the instrument to produce sounds, either by mechanically striking a string or tine (piano, electric piano, clavichord), plucking a string (harpsichord), causing air to flow through a pipe (organ), striking a bell (carillon), or, on electric and electronic keyboards, completing a circuit (Hammond organ, digital piano, synthesizer). 

Musical tuning<====>20817<====>Musical tuningIn music, there are two common meanings for tuning:Tuning practice, the act of tuning an instrument or voice. Tuning systems, the various systems of pitches used to tune an instrument, and their theoretical bases. Tuning practiceTuning is the process of adjusting the pitch of one or many tones from musical instruments to establish typical intervals between these tones.  Tuning is usually based on a fixed reference, such as A = 440 Hz.  Out of tune refers to a pitch/tone that is either too high (sharp) or too low (flat) in relation to a given reference pitch.  While an instrument might be in tune relative to its own range of notes, it may not be considered 'in tune' if it does not match A = 440 Hz (or whatever reference pitch one might be using).

Miller–Urey experiment<====>20821<====>Miller–Urey experimentThe Miller–Urey experiment  (or Miller experiment)  was a chemical experiment that simulated the conditions thought at the time to be present on the early Earth, and tested the chemical origin of life under those conditions.  The experiment supported Alexander Oparin's and J.  B.  S.  Haldane's hypothesis that putative conditions on the primitive Earth favoured chemical reactions that synthesized more complex organic compounds from simpler inorganic precursors.  Considered to be the classic experiment investigating abiogenesis, it was conducted in 1952  by Stanley Miller, with assistance from Harold Urey, at the University of Chicago and later the University of California, San Diego and published the following year. 

Majority function<====>20823<====>Majority functionIn Boolean logic, the majority function (also called the median operator)  is a function from n inputs to one output.  The value of the operation is false when n/2 or more arguments are false, and true otherwise. Alternatively, representing true values as 1 and false values as 0, we may use the formula \operatorname{Majority} \left ( p_1,\dots,p_n \right ) =  \left \lfloor \frac{1}{2} +  \frac{\left(\sum_{i=1}^n  p_i\right) - 1/2}{n} \right \rfloor.   The "−1/2" in the formula serves to break ties in favor of zeros when n is even.  If the term "−1/2" is omitted, the formula can be used for a function that breaks ties in favor of ones. 

Modula<====>20824<====>Modula   The Modula programming language is a descendant of the Pascal programming language.  It was developed in Switzerland in the 1970s by Niklaus Wirth, the same person who designed Pascal.  The main innovation of Modula over Pascal is a module system, used for grouping sets of related declarations into program units; hence the name Modula.  The language is defined in a report by Wirth called Modula.  A language for modular multiprogramming published 1976.  Modula was first implemented by Niklaus Wirth himself on a PDP-11.  Very soon other implementations followed, most important the University of York Modula compiler and a compiler developed at Philips Laboratories named PL Modula, which generated code for the LSI-11 microprocessor. 

Monolithic kernel<====>20825<====>Monolithic kernel A monolithic kernel is an operating system architecture where the entire operating system is working in kernel space and is alone in supervisor mode.  The monolithic model differs from other operating system architectures (such as the microkernel architecture)   in that it alone defines a high-level virtual interface over computer hardware.  A set of primitives or system calls implement all operating system services such as process management, concurrency, and memory management.  Device drivers can be added to the kernel as modules. Loadable modulesModular operating systems such as OS-9 and most modern monolithic operating systems such as OpenVMS, Linux, BSD, and UNIX variants such as  SunOS, and AIX, in addition to MULTICS, can dynamically load (and unload) executable modules at runtime. 

Mithraism<====>20826<====>Mithraism Mithraism, also known as the Mithraic mysteries, was a mystery religion centered around the god Mithras that was practised in the Roman Empire from about the 1st to the 4th century CE.  The religion was inspired by Persian worship of the god Mithra (proto-Indo-Iranian Mitra), though the Greek Mithras was linked to a new and distinctive imagery, and the level of continuity between Persian and Greco-Roman practice is debated.The mysteries were popular in the Roman military.  Worshippers of Mithras had a complex system of seven grades of initiation and communal ritual meals. 

Minivan<====>20828<====>Minivan  A minivan (American English), people carrier (British English),  or MPV (multi-purpose vehicle) or MUV (multi-utility vehicle) is a vehicle size classification describing a high-roof vehicle with a flexible interior layout.  Smaller sizes are mini MPV and compact MPV classifications.  The minivan combines a high-roof, five-door one- or two-box hatchback body configuration with a mid-size platform, engine and mechanicals; car-like handling and fuel economy; unibody construction; front-wheel or all-wheel drive and greater height than sedan or station wagon counterparts.   The design offers higher h-point seating, two or three rows of seating, easy passenger and cargo access with sliding wide-opening rear doors and large rear hatch, and a re-configurable interior volume with seats that recline, slide, tumble, fold flat or allow easy removal—enabling users to reprioritize passenger and cargo volumes. 

Moxie<====>20829<====>Moxie   Moxie is a brand of carbonated beverage that was among the first mass-produced soft drinks in the United States.  It continues to be regionally popular today.  It is produced by the Moxie Beverage Company of Bedford, New Hampshire, which, through several levels of wholly owned subsidiaries, is part of the Kirin Holdings Company of Tokyo, Japan.  As a result of widespread brand advertising, the brand name has become the word "moxie" in the English language, meaning "courage, daring, or spirit". Moxie's flavor is unique, as it is not as sweet as most modern soft drinks and is described by some as bitter. 

Manifesto<====>20832<====>Manifesto   A manifesto is a published verbal declaration of the intentions, motives, or views of the issuer, be it an individual, group, political party or government.David Robertson, The Routledge Dictionary of Politics,Edition 3, Psychology Press, 1890 p.  295,  , 9780415323772   A manifesto usually accepts a previously published opinion or public consensus or promotes a new idea with prescriptive notions for carrying out changes the author believes should be made.  It often is political or artistic in nature, but may present an individual's life stance.  Manifestos relating to religious belief are generally referred to as creeds. 

Mary Tyler Moore<====>20833<====>Mary Tyler Moore   Mary Tyler Moore (December 29, 1936 – January 25, 2017) was an American actress, known for her roles in the television sitcoms The Mary Tyler Moore Show (1970–1977), in which she starred as Mary Richards, a single woman working as a local news producer in Minneapolis, and The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961–1966), in which she played Laura Petrie, a former dancer turned Westchester homemaker, wife and mother. Her film work includes 1967's Thoroughly Modern Millie and 1980's Ordinary People, in which she played a role that was very different from the television characters she had portrayed, and for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. 

Menilite<====>20834<====>MeniliteMenilite is a greyish-brown form of the mineraloid opal. Menilite on Mindat.org  It is also known as liver opal or leberopal (German), due to its color. It is called menilite because it was first described from Ménilmontant (Paris), France,  where it occurs as concretions within bituminous Early Oligocene Menilite Shales.See alsoGeyseriteHyaliteReferences   

Mason Remey<====>20835<====>Mason Remey Charles Mason Remey (May 15, 1874 – February 4, 1974) was a prominent and controversial American Bahá'í who was appointed in 1951 a Hand of the Cause,  and president of the International Bahá'í Council. He was the architect for the Bahá'í Houses of Worship in Uganda and Australia, and Shoghi Effendi approved his design of the unbuilt House of Worship in Haifa, Israel.  When Shoghi Effendi died in 1957, he died without explicitly appointing a successor Guardian, and Remey was among the nine Hands of the Cause elected as an interim authority until the election of the first Universal House of Justice in 1963. 

Minimalism<====>20836<====>Minimalism  In visual arts, music, and other mediums, minimalism is an art movement that began in post–World War II Western art, most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s.  Prominent artists associated with minimalism include Donald Judd, John McCracken, Agnes Martin, Dan Flavin, Robert Morris, Anne Truitt, and Frank Stella. It derives from the reductive aspects of modernism and is often interpreted as a reaction against abstract expressionism and a bridge to postminimal art practices. Minimalism in music often features repetition and iteration such as those of the compositions of La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Julius Eastman, and John Adams. 

Ignition magneto<====>20837<====>Ignition magneto An ignition magneto, or high tension magneto, is a magneto that provides current for the ignition system of a spark-ignition engine, such as a petrol engine.  It produces pulses of high voltage for the spark plugs.  The older term tension means voltage.  The use of ignition magnetos is now confined mainly to engines where there is no other available electrical supply, for example in lawnmowers and chainsaws.   It is also widely used in aviation piston engines even though an electrical supply is usually available.  In this case the magneto's self-powered operation is considered to offer increased reliability; in theory the magneto should continue operation as long as the engine is turning. 

Mystery Science Theater 3000<====>20840<====>Mystery Science Theater 3000  Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K)  is  an American television comedy series created by Joel Hodgson and produced by Alternaversal Productions, LLC.  The show premiered on KTMA (now WUCW) in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on November 24, 1988.  It later aired on The Comedy Channel/Comedy Central for seven seasons until its cancellation in 1997.  Thereafter, it was picked up by The Sci-Fi Channel and aired for three seasons until another cancellation in August 1999.  A 60-episode syndication package titled The Mystery Science Theater Hour was produced in 1995.  In 2015, Hodgson led a crowdfunded revival of the series with 14 episodes in its eleventh season, released on Netflix on April 14, 2017, with another season to follow in the near future. 

Music radio<====>20841<====>Music radio Music radio is a radio format in which music is the main broadcast content.  After television replaced old time radio's dramatic content, music formats became dominant in many countries.   Radio drama and comedy continue, often on public radio. Music drives radio technology, including wide-band FM, modern digital radio systems such as Digital Radio Mondiale, and even the rise of internet radio and music streaming services (such as Pandora and Spotify). How it works  The radio station provides programming to attract listeners.  Commercial radio stations make profits by selling advertising.  Public and community radio stations are sustained by listener donations and grants. 

Massively multiplayer online role-playing game<====>20844<====>Massively multiplayer online role-playing game Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) are a combination of role-playing video games and massively multiplayer online games in which a very large number of players interact with one another within a virtual world. As in all RPGs, the player assumes the role of a character (often in a fantasy world or science-fiction world) and takes control over many of that character's actions.  MMORPGs are distinguished from single-player or small multi-player online RPGs by the number of players able to interact together, and by the game's persistent world (usually hosted by the game's publisher), which continues to exist and evolve while the player is offline and away from the game. 

Multiplication<====>20845<====>Multiplication  Multiplication (often denoted by the cross symbol "×", by a point "⋅", by juxtaposition, or, on computers, by an asterisk "∗") is one of the four elementary mathematical operations of arithmetic; with the others being addition, subtraction and division. The multiplication of whole numbers may be thought as a repeated addition; that is, the multiplication of two numbers is equivalent to adding as many copies of one of them, the multiplicand, as the value of the other one, the multiplier.  Normally, the multiplier is written first and multiplicand second,    (though this can vary by language. 

Malt<====>20853<====>Malt  Malt is germinated cereal grains that have been dried in a process known as "malting".  The grains are made to germinate by soaking in water, and are then halted from germinating further by drying with hot air. Malting grains develops the enzymes required for modifying the grain's starches into various types of sugar, including the monosaccharide glucose, the disaccharide maltose, the trisaccharide maltotriose, and higher sugars called maltodextrines.  It also develops other enzymes, such as proteases, which break down the proteins in the grain into forms that can be used by yeast. 

Masonry<====>20857<====>Masonry  Masonry is the building of structures from individual units, which are often laid in and bound together by mortar; the term masonry can also refer to the units themselves.  The common materials of masonry construction are brick, building stone such as marble, granite, travertine, and limestone, cast stone, concrete block, glass block, and adobe.  Masonry is generally a highly durable form of construction.  However, the materials used, the quality of the mortar and workmanship, and the pattern in which the units are assembled can substantially affect the durability of the overall masonry construction.  A person who constructs masonry is called a mason or bricklayer. 

Mickey Mouse<====>20859<====>Mickey MouseMickey Mouse is a funny animal cartoon character and the mascot of The Walt Disney Company.  He was created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks at the Walt Disney Studios in 1928.  An anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white gloves, Mickey is one of the world's most recognizable characters. Mickey first appeared in the short Plane Crazy, debuting publicly in the short film Steamboat Willie (1928), one of the first sound cartoons.  He went on to appear in over 130 films, including The Band Concert (1935), Brave Little Tailor (1938), and Fantasia (1940). 

Meher Baba<====>20860<====>Meher Baba   Meher Baba (born Merwan Sheriar Irani; 25 February 1894  – 31 January 1969) was an Indian spiritual master who said he was the Avatar,    God in human form.   Merwan Sheriar Irani was born in 1894 in Pune, India to Irani Zoroastrian parents.  At the age of 19, he began a seven-year spiritual transformation.    During this time he contacted five spiritual masters before beginning his own mission and gathering his own disciples in early 1922, at the age of 27.  From 10 July 1925 to the end of his life, Meher Baba maintained silence, communicating by means of an alphabet board or by unique hand gestures. 

Cavity magnetron<====>20861<====>Cavity magnetron The cavity magnetron is a high-powered vacuum tube that generates microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field while moving past a series of open metal cavities (cavity resonators).  Electrons pass by the openings to these cavities and cause radio waves to oscillate within, similar to the way a whistle produces a tone when excited by an air stream blown past its opening.  The frequency of the microwaves produced, the resonant frequency, is determined by the cavities' physical dimensions.   Unlike other vacuum tubes such as a klystron or a traveling-wave tube (TWT), the magnetron cannot function as an amplifier in order to increase the intensity of an applied microwave signal; the magnetron serves solely as an oscillator, generating a microwave signal from direct current electricity supplied to the vacuum tube. 

Manorialism<====>20862<====>Manorialism  Manorialism was an essential element of feudal society.   It was the organizing principle of rural economy that originated in the Roman villa system of the Late Roman Empire,  and was widely practiced in medieval western and parts of central Europe.  It was slowly replaced by the advent of a money-based market economy and new forms of agrarian contract. Manorialism was characterised by the vesting of legal and economic power in a Lord of the Manor, supported economically from his own direct landholding in a manor (sometimes called a fief), and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under the jurisdiction of himself and his manorial court. 

Margaret Mitchell<====>20864<====>Margaret Mitchell  Margaret Munnerlyn Mitchell (November 8, 1900 – August 16, 1949)  was an American author and journalist.  One novel by Mitchell was published during her lifetime, the American Civil War-era novel, Gone with the Wind, for which she won the National Book Award for Most Distinguished Novel of 1936 "5 Honors Awarded on the Year's Books: . . . ", The New York Times, Feb 26, 1937, page 23.  ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851–2007).  and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1937.  In more recent years, a collection of Mitchell's girlhood writings and a novella she wrote as a teenager, Lost Laysen, have been published. 

Metamorphosis<====>20866<====>Metamorphosis  Metamorphosis is a biological process by which an animal physically develops after birth or hatching, involving a conspicuous and relatively abrupt change in the animal's body structure through cell growth and differentiation.  Metamorphosis is iodothyronine-induced and an ancestral feature of all chordates.  Robert J.  Denser Chordate Metamorphosis: Ancient Control by Iodothyronines Current Biology, 2008, Vol 18 No 13, R567-9.  DOI: 10. 1016/j. cub. 2008. 05. 024  Some insects, fishes, amphibians, mollusks, crustaceans, cnidarians, echinoderms, and tunicates undergo metamorphosis, which is often accompanied by a change of nutrition source or behavior.  Animals that go through metamorphosis are called metamorphoses. 

Monoamine oxidase inhibitor<====>20869<====>Monoamine oxidase inhibitor    Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are a class of drugs that inhibit the activity of one or both monoamine oxidase enzymes: monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B).  They have a long history of use as medications prescribed for the treatment of depression.  They are particularly effective in treating atypical depression.   They are also used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and several other disorders.  Reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs) are a subclass of MAOIs that selectively and reversibly inhibit the MAO-A enzyme.  RIMAs are used clinically in the treatment of depression and dysthymia, though they have not gained widespread market share in the United States. 

Mycology<====>20874<====>MycologyMycology is the branch of biology concerned with the study of fungi, including their genetic and biochemical properties, their taxonomy and their use to humans  as a source for tinder, medicine, food, and entheogens, as well as their dangers, such as toxicity or infection.  A biologist specializing in mycology is called a mycologist.  Mycology branches into the field of phytopathology, the study of plant diseases, and the two other disciplines that remain closely related because the vast majority of "plant" pathogens are fungi. OverviewHistorically, mycology was a branch of botany because, although fungi are evolutionarily more closely related to animals than to plants, this was not recognized until a few decades ago. 

Melancholia<====>20875<====>Melancholia   Melancholia (from  ,  ), Burton, Bk.  I, p.  147  also  lugubriousness, from the Latin lugere, to mourn; moroseness, from the Latin morosus, self-willed, fastidious habit; wistfulness, from old English wist: intent, or saturnine, was a concept in ancient and pre-modern medicine.   Melancholy was one of the four temperaments matching the four humours.    In the 19th century, "melancholia" could be physical as well as mental, and melancholic conditions were classified as such by their common cause rather than by their properties.  HistoryThe name "melancholia" comes from the old medical belief of the four humours: disease or ailment being caused by an imbalance in one or other of the four basic bodily liquids, or humours. 

Mimosa<====>20876<====>Mimosa   Mimosa is a genus of about 400 species of herbs and shrubs, in the mimosoid clade of the legume family Fabaceae.  The generic name is derived from the Greek word   (mimos), an "actor" or "mime," and the feminine suffix –osa, "resembling", suggesting its 'sensitive leaves' which seem to 'mimic conscious life'.Two species in the genus are especially notable.  One is Mimosa pudica, because of the way it folds its leaves when touched or exposed to heat.  It is native to southern Central and South America  but is widely cultivated elsewhere for its curiosity value, both as a houseplant in temperate areas, and outdoors in the tropics. 

Manhattan (cocktail)<====>20879<====>Manhattan (cocktail)  A Manhattan is a cocktail made with whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters.  Commonly used whiskeys include rye (the traditional choice), Canadian whisky, bourbon, blended whiskey, and Tennessee whiskey.  The cocktail is often stirred and strained into a cocktail glass, where it is garnished with a Maraschino cherry with a stem.    A Manhattan can also be served on the rocks in a lowball glass.  The whiskey-based Manhattan is one of five cocktails named for one of New York City's five boroughs, but is perhaps most closely related to the Brooklyn cocktail,  a mix utilizing dry vermouth and Maraschino liqueur in place of the Manhattan's sweet vermouth, as well as Amer Picon in place of the Manhattan's traditional bitters. 

Mira<====>20880<====>Mira Mira  , alternatively designated Omicron Ceti (ο Ceti, abbreviated Omicron Cet, ο Cet) is a red giant star estimated to be 200–400 light years from the Sun in the constellation of Cetus. ο Ceti is a binary stellar system, consisting of a variable red giant (Mira A) along with a white dwarf companion (Mira B).  Mira A is a pulsating variable star and was the first non-supernova variable star discovered, with the possible exception of Algol. Nomenclatureο Ceti (Latinised to Omicron Ceti) is the star's Bayer designation.

The ship was previously known as the MV Saint Magnus and the MV Jolly Indaco. 

Mojito<====>20883<====>Mojito  Mojito ( ;  ) is a traditional Cuban highball. Traditionally, a mojito is a cocktail that consists of five ingredients: white rum, sugar (traditionally sugar cane juice), lime juice, soda water, and mint.   The original Cuban recipe uses spearmint or yerba buena, a mint variety very popular on the island.   Its combination of sweetness, citrus, and mint flavors is intended to complement the rum, and has made the mojito a popular summer drink.   The cocktail has a relatively low alcohol content (about 10% alcohol by volume). 

Mohammed Zahir Shah<====>20886<====>Mohammed Zahir Shah Mohammed Zahir Shah ( ,  ; 16 October 1914 – 23 July 2007) was the last King of Afghanistan, reigning from 8 November 1933 until he was deposed on 17 July 1973.  He established friendly relations with many countries, including with both Cold War sides, and modernized the country in the 1960s.  His long reign was marked by peace and stability that was lost afterwards. While staying in Italy for medical treatment, Zahir Shah was overthrown in a surprise coup in 1973 by his cousin and former prime minister, Mohammed Daoud Khan, who established a republic. 

Miso<====>20889<====>Miso is a traditional Japanese seasoning produced by fermenting soybeans with salt and koji (the fungus Aspergillus oryzae) and sometimes rice, barley, or other ingredients.  The result is a thick paste used for sauces and spreads, pickling vegetables or meats, and mixing with dashi soup stock to serve as miso soup called  , a Japanese culinary staple.  High in protein and rich in vitamins and minerals, miso played an important nutritional role in feudal Japan.  Miso is still widely used in Japan, both in traditional and modern cooking, and has been gaining worldwide interest. 

Malcolm I of Scotland<====>20890<====>Malcolm I of Scotland Máel Coluim mac Domnaill (anglicised Malcolm I) (died 954) was king of Scots (before 943 – 954), becoming king when his cousin Causantín mac Áeda abdicated to become a monk.  He was the son of Domnall mac Causantín. Máel Coluim was probably born during his father's reign (889–900).   By the 940s, he was no longer a young man, and may have become impatient in awaiting the throne.  Willingly or not—the 11th-century Prophecy of Berchán, a verse history in the form of a supposed prophecy, states that it was not a voluntary decision that Constantine II abdicated in 943 and entered a monastery, leaving the kingdom to Máel Coluim. 

Malcolm III of Scotland<====>20892<====>Malcolm III of Scotland  Malcolm III (Gaelic: Máel Coluim; c.  26 March 1031 – 13 November 1093) was King of Scots from 1058 to 1093.  He was later nicknamed "Canmore" ("ceann mòr", Gaelic for "Great Chief": "ceann" denotes "leader", "head" (of state) and "mòr" denotes "pre-eminent", "great", and "big").    Malcolm's long reign of 35 years preceded the beginning of the Scoto-Norman age. Malcolm's kingdom did not extend over the full territory of modern Scotland: the north and west of Scotland remained under Scandinavian, Norse-Gael, and Gaelic rule, and the territories under the rule of the Kings of Scots did not extend much beyond the limits established by Malcolm II until the 12th century. 

Maximum transmission unit<====>20894<====>Maximum transmission unitIn computer networking, the maximum transmission unit (MTU)  is the size of the largest network layer protocol data unit that can be communicated in a single network transaction. Fixed MTU parameters usually appear in association with a communications interface or standard.  Some systems may decide MTU at connect time.  The MTU relates to, but is not identical with the maximum frame size that can be transported on the data link layer, e. g.  Ethernet frame. Larger MTU is associated with reduced overhead.  Smaller values can reduce network delay. 

MV Buffalo Soldier (T-AK-9301)<====>20895<====>MV Buffalo Soldier (T-AK-9301) }    MV Buffalo Soldier (T-AK-9301) is a roll-on/roll-off ship, formerly of the French Government Line (now merged into CMA CGM).  She was sold and reflagged US, renamed to honor Buffalo Soldiers, and chartered by the United States Navy Military Sealift Command as a Maritime Prepositioning ship serving at Diego Garcia laden with U. S.  Air Force munitions.  She is self-sustaining, that is, she can unload herself, an asset in harbors with little or no infrastructure.  Her 120-long-ton capacity roll-on/roll-off ramp accommodates tracked and wheeled vehicles of every description.  While she is not currently in service with MSC, ships with her general characteristics are designated Buffalo Soldier class, fleet designation AK 2222.

Strategic sealift ships<====>20898<====>Strategic sealift shipsStrategic sealift ships are part of the United States Military Sealift Command's (MSC) prepositioning program.  There are currently 49   ships in the program, strategically positioned around the globe to support the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Defense Logistics Agency.  Most are named after Medal of Honor recipients from the service they support.  The ships are assigned to two  Military Prepositioning Ship (MPS) squadrons  located in the Indian Ocean at Diego Garcia and the Western Pacific Ocean at Guam and Saipan.  The MPS ships in each squadron have sufficient equipment, supplies and ammunition to support a Marine Air-Ground Task Force for 30 days. 

Mathias Rust<====>20900<====>Mathias Rust  Mathias Rust (born 1 June 1968) is a German aviator known for his illegal landing near Red Square in Moscow on 28 May 1987.  An amateur pilot, the teenager flew from Helsinki, Finland to Moscow, being tracked several times by Soviet air defense and interceptors.  The Soviet fighters never received permission to shoot him down, and several times he was mistaken for a friendly aircraft.  He landed on Vasilevsky Descent next to Red Square near the Kremlin in the capital of the Soviet Union. Rust said he wanted to create an "imaginary bridge" to the East, and he has said that his flight was intended to reduce tension and suspicion between the two Cold War sides. 

Malware<====>20901<====>Malware   Malware, short for malicious software, is an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of forms of harmful or intrusive software,  including computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, scareware, and other malicious programs.    It can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software.   Malware is defined by its malicious intent, acting against the requirements of the computer user — and so does not include software that causes unintentional harm due to some deficiency. Programs supplied officially by companies can be considered malware if they secretly act against the interests of the computer user.

Mole Day<====>20906<====>Mole Day Mole Day is an unofficial holiday celebrated among chemists, chemistry students and chemistry enthusiasts on October 23, between 6:02 a. m.  and 6:02 p. m. , making the date 6:02 10/23 in the American style of writing dates.   The time and date are derived from Avogadro's number, which is approximately 6. 02 × 10 23 , defining the number of particles (atoms or molecules) in one mole of substance, one of the seven base SI units. OverviewMole Day originated in an article in The Science Teacher in the early 1980s. 

Motörhead<====>20907<====>Motörhead    Motörhead ( ) were   an English rock  band formed in June 1975 by bassist, singer, and songwriter Ian "Lemmy" Kilmister, who was the sole constant member, guitarist Larry Wallis and drummer Lucas Fox.  The band are often considered a precursor to the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s.    Though several guitarists and drummers have played in Motörhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature the work of "Fast" Eddie Clarke on guitar and Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor on drums. 

Multiverse<====>20911<====>Multiverse   The multiverse (or meta-universe) is a hypothetical set of various possible universes including the universe which we live in.  Together, these universes comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy and the physical laws and constants that describe them.The miscellaneous distinct universes within the multiverse are called the "parallel universes", "other universes" or "alternative universes".    Origin of the conceptIn Dublin in 1952, Erwin Schrödinger gave a lecture in which he jocularly warned his audience that what he was about to say might "seem lunatic".  He said that, when his equations seemed to describe several different histories, these were "not alternatives, but all really happen simultaneously".

Molotov cocktail<====>20922<====>Molotov cocktailA Molotov cocktail, also known as a petrol bomb, bottle bomb, poor man's grenade, Molotovin koktaili (Finnish), polttopullo (Finnish), fire bomb (not to be confused with an actual fire bomb) or just Molotov, is a generic name used for a variety of bottle-based  improvised incendiary weapons.  Due to the relative ease of production, Molotov cocktails have been used by street criminals, protesters, rioters, gangsters, urban guerrillas, terrorists, irregular soldiers, or even regular soldiers short on equivalent military-issue weapons.  They are primarily intended to set targets ablaze rather than obliterate them. NameThe name "Molotov cocktail" was coined by the Finns during the Winter War, Online Etymology Dictionary: Molotov cocktail. 

Matzo<====>20923<====>Matzo   Matzo, matza or matzah (  matsah,   matsa; plural matzot; matzos of Ashkenazi Hebrew dialect) is an unleavened flatbread that is part of Jewish cuisine and forms an integral element of the Passover festival, during which chametz (leaven and five grains that, per Jewish Law, can be leavened) is forbidden. As legend goes, the Jews did not have time to wait for the bread to leaven when fleeing Egypt hence they only consumed Matzo, this special unleavened bread.  During Passover it is eaten as a flat, cracker-like bread or used in dishes as breadcrumbs and in the traditional matzo ball soup. 

Michel Tremblay<====>20925<====>Michel Tremblay  Michel Tremblay, CQ (born 25 June 1942) is a French Canadian novelist and playwright. Tremblay was born in Montreal, Quebec, where he grew up in the French-speaking neighbourhood of Plateau Mont-Royal, at the time of his birth a neighbourhood with a working-class character and joual dialect, something that would heavily influence his work.  Tremblay's first professionally produced play, Les Belles-Sœurs, was written in 1965 and premiered at the Théâtre du Rideau Vert on August 28, 1968.  It transformed the old guard of Canadian theatre and introduced joual to the mainstream.  It stirred up controversy by portraying the lives of working class women and attacking the straight-laced, deeply religious society of mid-20th century Quebec. 

Supervised learning<====>20926<====>Supervised learning   Supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from  .   The training data consist of a set of training examples.   In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal).   A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples.  An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances.  This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a "reasonable" way (see inductive bias). 

Martin Helwig<====>20932<====>Martin HelwigMartin Helwig ( ) (5 November 1516 – 26 January 1574) was a German cartographer of and from Silesia andpedagogue.  He was born in Neisse and died in Breslau, Holy Roman Empire. LifeA former pupil of an eminent German scholar and educationist Valentin Friedland, Martin Helwig went on to study at the University of Wittenberg, where as a student of Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon he earned the academic degree of Magister.  In 1552, he became Rector of St.  Maria Magdalena School in Breslau (now Wrocław, in Poland).  Equally proficient in mathematics and geography as well as classical languages, he produced the first woodcut map of Silesia made on the basis of surveys and data collected from local inhabitants, Martin Helwig Map of Silesia 1561 - first woodcut map of Silesia made on the basis of surveys and data collected from local inhabitants - published 1561. 

Macro virus<====>20934<====>Macro virus In computing terminology, a macro virus is a virus that is written in a macro language: a programming language which is embedded inside a software application (e. g. , word processors and spreadsheet applications).  Some applications, such as Microsoft Office, Excel, PowerPoint  allow macro programs to be embedded in documents such that the macros are run automatically when the document is opened, and this provides a distinct mechanism by which malicious computer instructions can spread.  This is one reason it can be dangerous to open unexpected attachments in e-mails.  Many antivirus programs can detect macro viruses, however the macro virus' behavior can still be difficult to detect. 

Microsoft Access<====>20935<====>Microsoft Access  Microsoft Access is a database management system (DBMS) from Microsoft that combines the relational Microsoft Jet Database Engine with a graphical user interface and software-development tools.  It is a member of the Microsoft Office suite of applications, included in the Professional and higher editions or sold separately.

Software developers, data architects and power users can use Microsoft Access to develop application software. 

Metabolic pathway<====>20941<====>Metabolic pathway In biochemistry, a metabolic pathway is a linked series of chemical reactions occurring within a cell.   The reactants, products, and intermediates of an enzymatic reaction are known as metabolites, which are modified by a sequence of chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes.   In a metabolic pathway, the product of one enzyme acts as the substrate for the next.  These enzymes often require dietary minerals, vitamins, and other cofactors to function. Different metabolic pathways function based on the position within a eukaryotic cell and the significance of the pathway in the given compartment of the cell. 

Malthusian catastrophe<====>20942<====>Malthusian catastrophe A Malthusian catastrophe (also known as Malthusian check or Malthusian spectre) is a prediction of a forced return to subsistence-level conditions once population growth has outpaced agricultural production. Thomas MalthusIn 1779, Thomas Malthus wrote: Notwithstanding the apocalyptic image conveyed by this particular paragraph, Malthus himself did not subscribe to the notion that mankind was fated for a "catastrophe" due to population overshooting resources.  Rather, he believed that population growth was generally restricted by available resources: ==Neo-Malthusian theory== After World War II, mechanized agriculture produced a dramatic increase in productivity of agriculture and the Green Revolution greatly increased crop yields, expanding the world's food supply while lowering food prices. 

Millennialism<====>20943<====>Millennialism   Millennialism (from millennium, Latin for "a thousand years"), or chiliasm (from the Greek equivalent), is a belief advanced by some Christian denominations that a Golden Age or Paradise will occur on Earth in which "Christ will reign" for 1000 years prior to the final judgment and future eternal state (the "World to Come" of the New Heavens and New Earth).  This belief derives primarily from  .  Millennialism is a specific form of millenarianism. Similarities to millennialism appear in Zoroastrianism, which identified successive thousand-year periods, each of which will end in a cataclysm of heresy and destruction, until the final destruction of evil and of the spirit of evil by a triumphant king of peace at the end of the final millennial age (supposed by some  to occur in the year 2000). 

Might and Magic<====>20945<====>Might and Magic   Might and Magic is a series of role-playing video games from New World Computing, which in 1996 became a subsidiary of The 3DO Company.

Brainwashing<====>20948<====>Brainwashing    Brainwashing (also known as mind control, menticide, coercive persuasion,  thought control, thought reform, and re-education) is a non-scientific concept that the human mind can be altered or controlled by certain psychological techniques.  Brainwashing is said to reduce its subject’s ability to think critically or independently,  to allow the introduction of new, unwanted thoughts and ideas into the subject’s mind,  as well as to change his or her attitudes, values, and beliefs.   The concept of brainwashing was originally developed in the 1950s to explain how the Chinese government appeared to make people cooperate with them.

First drafted by the Archbishop of Canterbury to make peace between the unpopular King and a group of rebel barons, it promised the protection of church rights, protection for the barons from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, and limitations on feudal payments to the Crown, to be implemented through a council of 25 barons. 

Möbius function<====>20961<====>Möbius function  For the rational functions defined on the complex numbers, see Möbius transformation. The classical Möbius function   is an important multiplicative function in number theory and combinatorics.  The German mathematician August Ferdinand Möbius introduced it in 1832.    It is a special case of a more general object in combinatorics. DefinitionFor any positive integer  , define   as the sum of the primitive  th roots of unity.  It has values in  {  ,  ,   }  depending on the factorization of   into prime factors:  if   is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors. 

Methadone<====>20962<====>Methadone   Methadone, sold under the brand name Dolophine, among others, is an opioid used to treat pain and as maintenance therapy or to help with tapering in people with opioid dependence.Detoxification using methadone can either be done relatively rapidly in less than a month or gradually over as long as six months.   While a single dose has a rapid effect, maximum effect can take five days of use.   The effects last about six hours after a single dose.   After long term use, in people with normal liver function, effects last 8 to 36 hours. 

Möbius inversion formula<====>20963<====>Möbius inversion formula In mathematics, the classic Möbius inversion formula was introduced into number theory during the 19th century by August Ferdinand Möbius.Other Möbius inversion formulas are obtained when different locally finite partially ordered sets replace the classic case of the natural numbers ordered by divisibility; for an account of those, see incidence algebra. Statement of the formulaThe classic version states that if   and   are arithmetic functions satisfying g(n)=\sum_{d\,\mid \,n}f(d)\quad\text{for every integer }n\ge 1 then f(n)=\sum_{d\,\mid\, n}\mu(d)g\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)\quad\text{for every integer }n\ge 1 where   is the Möbius function and the sums extend over all positive divisors   of  .

A brief section on each, with a link to the page about the particular species is provided along with references for further information. Angelfish (large)These large fish are considered to be quite hardy, but because of their size may present a significant challenge to the keeper.  They need huge aquariums, up to 180 gallons to house one for its entire lifespan.Two angels might be kept in the same aquarium provided it is a large aquarium, they are properly acclimated as juveniles, and they have very different colouring and body shape. 

Magazine<====>21001<====>Magazine A magazine is a publication, usually a periodical publication, which is printed or electronically published (sometimes referred to as an online magazine).  Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content.  They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three.  At its root, the word "magazine" refers to a collection or storage location.  In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles.  This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines, artillery magazines, firearms magazines, and, in French, retail stores such as department stores. 

Multivibrator<====>21008<====>MultivibratorA multivibrator is an electronic circuit used to implement a variety of simple two-statedevices such as relaxation oscillators, timers and flip-flops.  It consists of two amplifying devices (transistors, vacuum tubes or other devices) cross-coupled by resistors or capacitors.    The first multivibrator circuit, the astable multivibrator oscillator, was invented by Henri Abraham and Eugene Bloch during World War I.    They called their circuit a "multivibrator" because its output waveform was rich in harmonics.  The three types of multivibrator circuits are:Astable multivibrator, in which the circuit is not stable in either state —it continually switches from one state to the other. 

Marsh gas<====>21009<====>Marsh gasMarsh gas, swamp gas and  bog gas are common names for biogas which forms in wetlands, whose principal component is methane with hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide as minor compositions, produced naturally within some geographical marshes, swamps, and bogs. The surface of marshes, swamps and bogs is initially porous vegetation that rots to form a crust that prevents oxygen from reaching the organic material  trapped below.  That is the condition that allows anaerobic digestion and fermentation of any plant or animal material which incidentally also produces methane. In some cases there is sufficient heat, fuel and oxygen to allow spontaneous combustion and underground fires to smolder for some considerable time as occurred at a natural reserve in Spain. 

Merseburg<====>21012<====>Merseburg   Merseburg ( ) is a town in the south of the German state of Saxony-Anhalt on the river Saale, approx.  14 km south of Halle (Saale).

Microcontroller<====>21017<====>Microcontroller A microcontroller (or MCU for microcontroller unit) is a small computer on a single integrated circuit.  In modern terminology, it is similar to, but less sophisticated than, a system on a chip or SoC; an SoC may include a microcontroller as one of its components.  A microcontroller contains one or more CPUs (processor cores) along with memory and programmable input/output peripherals.  Program memory in the form of ferroelectric RAM, NOR flash or OTP ROM is also often included on chip, as well as a small amount of RAM.  Microcontrollers are designed for embedded applications, in contrast to the microprocessors used in personal computers or other general purpose applications consisting of various discrete chips.

Mormonism<====>21023<====>Mormonism  Mormonism is the predominant religious tradition of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity.  Joseph Smith founded the movement in Western New York in the 1820s.  During the 1830s and 1840s, it distinguished itself from traditional Protestantism.  Mormonism represents the faith taught by Smith in the 1840s.  After he was killed in 1844, most Mormons followed Brigham Young on his westward journey to the area that became the Utah Territory, calling themselves The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).  Other sects include Mormon fundamentalism, which seeks to maintain practices and doctrines such as polygamy,  and various other small independent denominations.

List of military tactics<====>21027<====>List of military tactics   This page contains a list of military tactics.  The meaning of the phase is context sensitive, and has varied over time, like the difference between "strategy" and "tactics".  General tacticsExploiting prevailing weather – the tactical use of weather as a force multiplier has influenced many important battles throughout history, such as the Battle of Waterloo.  Fire attacks – reconnaissance by fire is used by apprehensive soldiers when they suspect the enemy is nearby. Force concentration – the practice of concentrating a military force against a portion of an enemy force.  Night combat – combat that takes place at night. 

Mach (kernel)<====>21028<====>Mach (kernel)  Mach ( )  is an operating system kernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University to support operating system research, primarily distributed and parallel computing.  Mach is often mentioned as one of the earliest examples of a microkernel.  However, not all versions of Mach are microkernels.  Mach's derivatives are the basis of the modern operating system kernels in GNU Hurd and Apple's operating systems macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. The project at Carnegie Mellon ran from 1985 to 1994, ending with Mach 3. 0, which is a true microkernel.  Mach was developed as a replacement for the kernel in the BSD version of Unix, so no new operating system would have to be designed around it. 

Molokan<====>21029<====>Molokan A Molokan (  or  , "milk-drinker") is a member of various Spiritual Christian sects that evolved from Eastern Christianity in the East Slavic lands.  Their traditions—especially dairy consumption during Christian fasts—did not conform to those of the Russian Orthodox Church, and they were regarded as neither Eastern Orthodox, nor Catholic, nor Protestant.  .   The term Molokan is an exonym used by their Orthodox neighbors; they tend to identify themselves as Spiritual Christians (духовные христиане). Unlike the Protestant "reformists" of Western Europe, Molokans rejected conformity.   There are almost as many different ways among Molokans as there are Molokans. 

Musical chairs<====>21030<====>Musical chairs	Musical chairs is a game of elimination involving players, chairs, and music, with one fewer chair than players.   When the music stops whichever player fails to sit on a chair is eliminated, with a chair then being removed and the process repeated until only one player remains. It is also a metaphor for pointless shuffling of personnel in a company; a fruitless, repeated scavenger hunt-like experience; and cyclic replacement of political leaders, as in multiple cabinet shuffles. The gameMusical chairs is a game where a number of chairs, one fewer than the number of players, are arranged facing outward with the players standing in a circle just outside the chairs.

Mohism<====>21032<====>Mohism Mohism or Moism ( ) was an ancient Chinese philosophy of logic, rational thought and science developed by the academic scholars who studied under the ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi (c.  470 BC–c.  391 BC) and embodied in an eponymous book: the Mozi.  It evolved at about the same time as Confucianism, Taoism and Legalism, and was one of the four main philosophic schools from around 770–221 BC (during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods).  During that time, Mohism was seen as a major rival to Confucianism.  The administrative thought of Mohism was absorbed by Chinese Legalism and its books were later merged into the Taoist canon, all but disappearing as an independent school of thought. 

Migraine<====>21035<====>Migraine    A migraine is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent headaches that are moderate to severe.   Typically, the headaches affect one half of the head, are pulsating in nature, and last from two to 72 hours.   Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell.The pain is generally made worse by physical activity.    as PDF    Up to one-third of people have an aura: typically a short period of visual disturbance that signals that the headache will soon occur. 

Meet the Feebles<====>21037<====>Meet the Feebles   Meet the Feebles is a 1989 New Zealand musical black comedy film directed by Peter Jackson, and written by Jackson, Fran Walsh, Stephen Sinclair, and Danny Mulheron.  It features Jim Henson-esque puppets in a perverse comic satire. Like Henson's Muppets, the Feebles are animal-figured puppets (plus some people in suits) who are members of a stage troupe.  However, whereas Henson's Muppets characterize positivity, naïve folly, and innocence, the Feebles present negativity, vice, and other misanthropic characteristics, apart, it could be argued, from Robert the hedgehog, who is portrayed as positive, innocent and naive. 

Mafic<====>21040<====>MaficMafic is an adjective describing a silicate mineral or igneous rock that is rich in magnesium and iron, and is thus a portmanteau of magnesium and ferric.   Most mafic minerals are dark in color, and common rock-forming mafic minerals include olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite.  Common mafic rocks include basalt, diabase and gabbro.  Mafic rocks often also contain calcium-rich varieties of plagioclase feldspar.  Chemically, mafic rocks are enriched in iron, magnesium and calcium and typically dark in color.  In contrast the felsic rocks are typically light in color and enriched in aluminium and silicon along with potassium and sodium. 

Military ordinariate<====>21047<====>Military ordinariate   A military ordinariate is an ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church, of the Latin or an Eastern Church, responsible for the pastoral care of Catholics serving in the armed forces of a nation.

Moral equivalence<====>21056<====>Moral equivalence Moral equivalence is a term used in political debate, usually to deny that a moral comparison can be made of two sides in a conflict, or in the actions or tactics of two sides. The term had some currency in polemic debates about the Cold War, and more currently the Arab–Israeli conflict.  "Moral equivalence" began to be used as a polemic term-of-retort to "moral relativism", which had been gaining use as an indictment against political foreign policy that appeared to use only a situation-based application of widely held ethical standards. International conflicts are sometimes viewed similarly, and interested parties periodically urge both sides to conduct a ceasefire and negotiate their differences. 

Motel<====>21058<====>Motel  A motel is a hotel designed for motorists and usually has a parking area for motor vehicles.  Entering dictionaries after World War II, the word motel, coined as a portmanteau contraction of "motor hotel", originates from the Milestone Mo-Tel of San Luis Obispo, California (now called the Motel Inn of San Luis Obispo), which was built in 1925.   The term referred initially to a type of hotel consisting of a single building of connected rooms whose doors faced a parking lot and in some circumstances, a common area or a series of small cabins with common parking. 

Constructivism (mathematics)<====>21059<====>Constructivism (mathematics)In the philosophy of mathematics, constructivism asserts that it is necessary to find (or "construct") a mathematical object to prove that it exists.  In standard mathematics, one can prove the existence of a mathematical object without "finding" that object explicitly, by assuming its non-existence and then deriving a contradiction from that assumption.  This proof by contradiction is not constructively valid.  The constructive viewpoint involves a verificational interpretation of the existential quantifier, which is at odds with its classical interpretation. There are many forms of constructivism.   These include the program of intuitionism founded by Brouwer, the finitism of Hilbert and Bernays, the constructive recursive mathematics of Shanin and Markov, and Bishop's program of constructive analysis.

Mica<====>21061<====>Mica  The mica group of sheet silicate (phyllosilicate) minerals includes several closely related materials having nearly perfect basal cleavage.  All are monoclinic, with a tendency towards pseudohexagonal crystals, and are similar in chemical composition.  The nearly perfect cleavage, which is the most prominent characteristic of mica, is explained by the hexagonal sheet-like arrangement of its atoms.

NupeCode<====>21105<====>NupeCode NupeCode is free/open source software (released under the GNU General Public License) designed for large peer review projects.  The code was available via Nupedia's CVS repository.  One of the problems experienced by Nupedia during much of its existence was that the software lacked functionality.   Much of the missing functionality had been mocked-up using underlined blocks of text that appeared to be hyperlinks, but actually were not.  As part of the project, a new version of the original software (called "NuNupedia") was under development.  NuNupedia was implemented for testing at SourceForge, but never reached sufficient development to replace the original software.

Neuron<====>21120<====>Neuron   A neuron, also known as a neurone and nerve cell, is an electrically excitable cell that receives, processes, and transmits information through electrical and chemical signals.  These signals between neurons occur via specialized connections called synapses.  Neurons can connect to each other to form neural networks.  Neurons are the primary components of the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord, and of the peripheral nervous system, which comprises the autonomic nervous system and the somatic nervous system. There are many types of specialized neurons.  Sensory neurons respond to one particular type of stimuli such as touch, sound, or light and all other stimuli affecting the cells of the sensory organs, and converts it into an electrical signal via transduction, which is then sent to the spinal cord or brain. 

Usenet newsgroup<====>21125<====>Usenet newsgroup  A Usenet newsgroup is a   usually within the Usenet system, for messages posted from many users in different locations using Internet.  Despite the name, newsgroups are discussion groups, and are not devoted to publishing news, but were when the internet was young.  Newsgroups are technically distinct from, but functionally similar to, discussion forums on the World Wide Web.  Newsreader software is used to read newsgroups. Before the uptake of the World Wide Web, Usenet newsgroups were among the most popular Internet services, and have retained their noncommercial nature in contrast to the increasingly ad-laden web. 

NATO<====>21133<====>NATO   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO  ;  ;  ), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance between several North American and European states based on the North Atlantic Treaty that was signed on 4 April 1949.   NATO constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party.  Three NATO members (the United States, France and the United Kingdom) are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and are officially nuclear-weapon states. 

New Hampshire<====>21134<====>New HampshireNew Hampshire is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States.  It is bordered by Massachusetts to the south, Vermont to the west, Maine and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north.  New Hampshire is the 5th smallest by land area and the 10th least populous of the 50 United States. In January 1776, it became the first of the British North American colonies to establish a government independent of the Kingdom of Great Britain's authority, and it was the first to establish its own state constitution. 

Numerology<====>21137<====>NumerologyNumerology is any belief in the divine or mystical relationship between a number and one or more coinciding events.   It is also the study of the numerical value of the letters in words, names and ideas.  It is often associated with the paranormal, alongside astrology and similar divinatory arts.  Despite the long history of numerological ideas, the word "numerology" is not recorded in English before c. 1907.  The term numerologist can be used for those who place faith in numerical patterns and draw pseudo-scientific inferences from them, even if those people do not practice traditional numerology. 

North America<====>21139<====>North America   North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere; it is also considered by some to be a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers  (9,540,000 square miles), about 16. 5% of the earth's land area and about 4. 

Noble gas<====>21140<====>Noble gas The noble gases (historically also the inert gases) make up a group of chemical elements with similar properties; under standard conditions, they are all odorless, colorless, monatomic gases with very low chemical reactivity.  The six noble gases that occur naturally are helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and the radioactive radon (Rn).  Oganesson (Og) is variously predicted to be a noble gas as well or to break the trend due to relativistic effects; its chemistry has not yet been investigated. For the first six periods of the periodic table, the noble gases are exactly the members of group 18. 

Natural monopoly<====>21143<====>Natural monopolyA natural monopoly is a monopoly in an industry in which high infrastructural costs and other barriers to entry relative to the size of the market give the largest supplier in an industry, often the first supplier in a market, an overwhelming advantage over potential competitors.  This frequently occurs in industries where capital costs predominate, creating economies of scale that are large in relation to the size of the market; examples include public utilities such as water services and electricity.    Natural monopolies were discussed as a potential source of market failure by John Stuart Mill, who advocated government regulation to make them serve the public good. 

Natural selection<====>21147<====>Natural selection Natural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype.  It is a key mechanism of evolution, the change in the heritable traits characteristic of a population  over generations.  Charles Darwin popularised the term "natural selection", contrasting it with artificial selection, which is intentional, whereas natural selection is not. Variation exists within all populations of organisms.  This occurs partly because random mutations arise in the genome of an individual organism, and offspring can inherit such mutations.  Throughout the lives of the individuals, their genomes interact with their environments to cause variations in traits. 

Netherlands<====>21148<====>NetherlandsThe Netherlands ( ;    ), also known informally as Holland, is a country in Western Europe with a population of seventeen million.  Together with three island territories in the Caribbean (Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba), it forms the main constituent country of the  Kingdom of the Netherlands.  The European portion of the Netherlands consists of twelve provinces and borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders in the North Sea with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany.   The five largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht (forming the Randstad megalopolis) and Eindhoven (leading the Brabantse Stedenrij). 

N.W.A<====>21149<====>N. W. A    N. W. A (an abbreviation for Niggaz Wit Attitudes)   was an American hip hop group from Los Angeles, California.  They were among the earliest and most significant popularizers and controversial figures of the gangsta rap subgenre, and are widely considered one of the greatest and most influential groups in the history of hip hop music.   Active from 1986 to 1991, the rap group endured controversy owing to their music's explicit lyrics, which many viewed as being disrespectful to women, as well as to its glorification of drugs and crime. 

Nibble<====>21150<====>Nibble  In computing, a nibble (often nybble or nyble to match the spelling of byte) is a four-bit aggregation,or half an octet.  It is also known as half-byte    or tetrade.In a networking or telecommunication context, the nibble is often called a semi-octet,  quadbit,  or quartet.   A nibble has sixteen (2 4 ) possible values.  A nibble can be represented by a single hexadecimal digit and called a hex digit.  A full byte (octet) is represented by two hexadecimal digits; therefore, it is common to display a byte of information as two nibbles. 

New wave music<====>21151<====>New wave music   New wave is a genre of rock music  popular in late 1970s and the 1980s with ties to mid-1970s punk rock.   New wave moved away from blues and rock and roll sounds to create pop music that incorporated disco, mod, and electronic music.  Initially new wave was similar to punk rock, before becoming a distinct genre.  It subsequently engendered subgenres and fusions, including synth-pop.  New wave differs from other movements with ties to first-wave punk as it displays characteristics common to pop music, rather than the more "artsy" post-punk. 

Telecommunications in the Netherlands<====>21160<====>Telecommunications in the Netherlands Communications in the Netherlands. Mail The postal service in the Netherlands is performed by PostNL in most cases—which has, as of 2008, a monopoly on letters lighter than 50 g.  NOSJOURNAAL - Reorganisatie bij postbedrijf   The monopoly is planned to expire in 2009.   PostNL's competitors include Selekt Mail and Sandd.    Post offices that are owned by Postbank and TNT Post have been earmarked for closure between 2008 and 2013.   Postal codes in the Netherlands are formed of four digits then two letters (in capitals), separated by a space— 1234 AB , for example. 

Transport in the Netherlands<====>21161<====>Transport in the Netherlands The Netherlands is both a very densely populated and a highly developed country, in which transport is a key factor of the economy.  Correspondingly it has a very dense and modern infrastructure, facilitating transport with road, rail, air and water networks.  In its Global Competitiveness Report for 2014-2015, the World Economic Forum ranked the Dutch transport infrastructure fourth in the world.  With a total road network of 139,000 km, including 3,530 km of expressways,    the Netherlands has one of the densest road networks in the world; much denser than Germany and France, but still not as dense as Belgium. 

Armed forces of the Netherlands<====>21162<====>Armed forces of the Netherlands  The Armed forces of the Netherlands consist of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The service branches consist of:Koninklijke Landmacht (KL), Royal Netherlands Army. Koninklijke Marine (KM), Royal Netherlands Navy and Korps Mariniers, Marine Corps. Koninklijke Luchtmacht (KLu), Royal Netherlands Air Force. Koninklijke Marechaussee (KMar), Royal Military Constabulary. In addition, within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, there are small local conscript forces on the islands of Aruba (Arumil) and Curaçao (Antmil).  These operate under the auspices of the Royal Netherlands Navy and Marines. The military ranks of the Dutch armed forces have similarities with British and U. 

Foreign relations of the Netherlands<====>21163<====>Foreign relations of the Netherlands The foreign policy of the Netherlands is based on four basic commitments: to the Atlantic cooperation, to European integration, to international development and to international law  .  While historically the Netherlands was a neutral state, since the second World War it has become a member of a large number of international organisations.  The Dutch economy is very open and relies on international trade.  One of the more controversial international issues surrounding the Netherlands is its liberal policy towards soft drugs and position of the Netherlands as one of the major exporters of hard drugs . 

Drug policy of the Netherlands<====>21164<====>Drug policy of the Netherlands   While recreational use, possession and trade of non-medicinal drugs described by the Opium Law are all technically illegal under Dutch law, official policy since the late 20th century has been to openly tolerate all recreational use while tolerating the other two under certain circumstances.  This pragmatic approach was motivated by the idea that a drug-free Dutch society is unrealistic and unattainable, and efforts would be better spent trying to minimize harm caused by recreational drug use.

Numeral system<====>21170<====>Numeral system   A numeral system (or system of numeration) is a writing system for expressing numbers; that is, a mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set, using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner.  It can be seen as the context that allows the symbols "11" to be interpreted as the binary symbol for three, the decimal symbol for eleven, or a symbol for other numbers in different bases. The number the numeral represents is called its value. Ideally, a numeral system will:Represent a useful set of numbers (e. g.  all integers, or rational numbers)Give every number represented a unique representation (or at least a standard representation)Reflect the algebraic and arithmetic structure of the numbers. 

Natural language<====>21173<====>Natural language   In neuropsychology, linguistics and the philosophy of language, a natural language or ordinary language is any language that has evolved naturally in humans through use and repetition without conscious planning or premeditation.  Natural languages can take different forms, such as speech or signing.  They are distinguished from constructed and formal languages such as those used to program computers or to study logic.    Defining natural languageThough the exact definition varies between scholars, natural language can broadly be defined in contrast to artificial or constructed languages (such as computer programming languages and international auxiliary languages) and to other communication systems in nature. 

Nanook of the North<====>21174<====>Nanook of the North   Nanook of the North (also known as Nanook of the North: A Story Of Life and Love In the Actual Arctic) is a 1922 American silent documentary film by Robert J.  Flaherty, with elements of docudrama, at a time when the concept of separating films into documentary and drama did not yet exist.  In the tradition of what would later be called salvage ethnography, Flaherty captured the struggles of the Inuk man named Nanook and his family in the Canadian Arctic.  The film has been incorrectly considered the first feature-length documentary. 

Nitrogen<====>21175<====>Nitrogen   Nitrogen is a chemical element with symbol N and atomic number 7.  It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772.  Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently done so at about the same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first.  The name nitrogène was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790, when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates.  Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the Greek άζωτικός "no life", as it is an asphyxiant gas; this name is instead used in many languages, such as French, Russian, and Turkish, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds. 

Nominalism<====>21176<====>NominalismIn metaphysics, nominalism is a philosophical view which denies the existence of universals and abstract objects, but affirms the existence of general or abstract terms and predicates.   There are at least two main versions of nominalism.  One version denies the existence of universals – things that can be instantiated or exemplified by many particular things (e. g. , strength, humanity).  The other version specifically denies the existence of abstract objects – objects that do not exist in space and time.  Most nominalists have held that only physical particulars in space and time are real, and that universals exist only post res, that is, subsequent to particular things. 

Non-cognitivism<====>21178<====>Non-cognitivism Non-cognitivism is the meta-ethical view that ethical sentences do not express propositions (i. e. , statements) and thus cannot be true or false (they are not truth-apt).  A noncognitivist denies the cognitivist claim that "moral judgments are capable of being objectively true, because they describe some feature of the world".If moral statements cannot be true, and if one cannot know something that is not true, noncognitivism implies that moral knowledge is impossible.  Non-cognitivism entails that non-cognitive attitudes underlie moral discourse and this discourse therefore consists of non-declarative speech acts, although accepting that its surface features may consistently and efficiently work as if moral discourse were cognitive. 

North Sea<====>21179<====>North SeaThe North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France.  An epeiric (or "shelf") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north.  It is more than   long and   wide, with an area of around  . The North Sea has long been the site of important European shipping lanes as well as a major fishery.  The sea is a popular destination for recreation and tourism in bordering countries and more recently has developed into a rich source of energy resources including fossil fuels, wind, and early efforts in wave power. 

Natural Born Killers<====>21180<====>Natural Born Killers    Natural Born Killers is a 1994 American satirical black comedy crime film directed by Oliver Stone and starring Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Robert Downey Jr. , Tom Sizemore, and Tommy Lee Jones.

The film is based on an original screenplay by Quentin Tarantino that was heavily revised by writer David Veloz, associate producer Richard Rutowski, and director Stone; Tarantino received story credit.  Jane Hamsher, Don Murphy, and Clayton Townsend produced the film, with Arnon Milchan, Thom Mount, and Stone as executive producers. 

Nancy Reagan<====>21181<====>Nancy Reagan  Nancy Davis Reagan (born Anne Frances Robbins; July 6, 1921 – March 6, 2016) was an American film actress and the wife of Ronald Reagan, the 40th President of the United States.  She served as the First Lady of the United States from 1981 to 1989. She was born in New York City.  After her parents separated, she lived in Maryland with an aunt and uncle for several years.  When her mother remarried in 1929, she moved to Chicago and later took the name Davis from her stepfather.  As Nancy Davis, she was a Hollywood actress in the 1940s and 1950s, starring in films such as The Next Voice You Hear. 

New Brunswick<====>21182<====>New Brunswick    New Brunswick ( ;  Canadian French pronunciation:   ) is one of three Maritime provinces, on the east coast of Canada. Being relatively close to Europe, New Brunswick was among the first places in North America to be explored and settled, starting with the French in the early 1600s, who eventually colonized most of the Maritimes and some of Maine as the colony of Acadia.   The area was caught up in the global conflict between the British and French empires, and in 1755 became part of Nova Scotia, to be partitioned off in 1784 following an influx of refugees from the American Revolutionary War. 

Nova Scotia<====>21184<====>Nova Scotia    Nova Scotia ( ; Latin for "New Scotland";  ; Scottish Gaelic: Alba Nuadh) is one of Canada's three maritime provinces, and one of the four provinces that form Atlantic Canada.  Its provincial capital is Halifax.  Nova Scotia is the second-smallest of Canada's ten provinces, with an area of 55,284 square kilometres (21,300 sq mi), including Cape Breton and another 3,800 coastal islands.  As of 2016, the population was 923,598.  Nova Scotia is Canada's second-most-densely populated province, after Prince Edward Island, with 17. 4 inhabitants per square kilometre (45/sq mi).  Etymology"Nova Scotia" means "New Scotland" in Latin  and is the recognized English-language name for the province.

Yellowknife became the territorial capital in 1967, following recommendations by the Carrothers Commission. The Northwest Territories, a portion of the old North-West Territory, entered the Canadian Confederation on July 15, 1870, but the current borders were formed on April 1, 1999, when the territory was subdivided to create Nunavut to the east, via the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement. 

Nez Perce people<====>21187<====>Nez Perce people  The Nez Perce   (autonym: Niimíípu in their own language, meaning "the walking people" or "we, the people" ) are an Indigenous people of the Plateau who have lived on the Columbia River Plateau in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States for at least 11,500 years.   Members of the Sahaptin language group,  the Niimíípu were the dominant Peoples of the Columbia Plateau for much of that time,  especially after acquiring horses and famously breeding the appaloosa horse in the 18th century.  Prior to "first contact" with [Western civilization] the Nimiipuu were economically and culturally influential in trade and war, interacting with other Indigenous Nations in a vast network from the western shores of Oregon and Washington, the high plains of Montana, and the northern Great Basin in southern Idaho and northern Nevada). 

Neolithic<====>21189<====>Neolithic The Neolithic (  ) was a period in the development of human technology, beginning about 10,200 BC, according to the ASPRO chronology, in some parts of the Middle East, and later in other parts of the world  and ending between 4500 and 2000 BC. Traditionally considered the last part of the Stone Age or The New Stone Age, the Neolithic followed the terminal Holocene Epipaleolithic period and commenced with the beginning of farming, which produced the "Neolithic Revolution".  It ended when metal tools became widespread (in the Copper Age or Bronze Age; or, in some geographical regions, in the Iron Age). 

Nomic<====>21190<====>Nomic   Nomic is a game created in 1982 by philosopher Peter Suber in which the rules of the game include mechanisms for the players to change those rules, usually beginning through a system of democratic voting. The initial ruleset was designed by Peter Suber, but first published in Douglas Hofstadter's column Metamagical Themas in Scientific American in June 1982.   The column discussed Suber's then-upcoming book, The Paradox of Self-Amendment, which was published some years later.  Nomic now refers to a large number of games, all based on the initial ruleset. 

Nintendo<====>21197<====>Nintendo    Nintendo Co. , Ltd.   is a Japanese multinational consumer electronics and video game company headquartered in Kyoto.  Nintendo is one of the world's largest video game companies by market capitalization, creating some of the best-known and top-selling video game franchises, such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Pokémon.   Founded on 23 September 1889    by Fusajiro Yamauchi, it originally produced handmade hanafuda playing cards.By 1963, the company had tried several small niche businesses, such as cab services and love hotels.Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo then developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over $85 billion. 

Nobel Prize<====>21201<====>Nobel Prize    The Nobel Prize ( ,  ; Swedish definite form, singular: Nobelpriset;  ) is a set of annual international awards bestowed in several categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, or scientific advances. The will of the Swedish scientist Alfred Nobel established the prizes in 1895.  The prizes in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901.   Medals made before 1980 were struck in 23 carat gold, and later in 18 carat green gold plated with a 24 carat gold coating.  Between 1901 and 2016, the Nobel Prizes and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences were awarded 579 times to 911 people and organisations. 

Niels Bohr<====>21210<====>Niels BohrNiels Henrik David Bohr ( ; 7 October 1885 – 18 November 1962) was a Danish physicist who made foundational contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum theory, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922.  Bohr was also a philosopher and a promoter of scientific research. Bohr developed the Bohr model of the atom, in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another.  Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. 

National Football League<====>21211<====>National Football LeagueThe National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC).  The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world.   The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week.  Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, which is usually held in the first Sunday in February, and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC. 

Nazi Germany<====>21212<====>Nazi Germany   Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was under the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler through the Nazi Party (NSDAP).  Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a totalitarian state in which the Nazi Party controlled nearly all aspects of life.  The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich from 1933 to 1943 and Großdeutsches Reich ("Greater German Reich") from 1943 to 1945.  The period is also known under the names the Third Reich (Drittes Reich, meaning "Third Realm" or "Third Empire", with the Holy Roman Empire and the German Empire being the first two) and the National Socialist Period (Zeit des Nationalsozialismus, abbreviated as NS-Zeit, literally "Time of National Socialism"). 

Naraoiidae<====>21214<====>Naraoiidae Naraoiidae is a family, of extinct, soft-shelled trilobite-like arthropods, that belongs to the order Nectaspida.  Species included in the Naraoiidae are known from the second half of the Lower Cambrian to the end of the Upper Silurian.  The total number of collection sites is limited and distributed over a vast period of time: Maotianshan Shale and Balang Formation (China), Burgess Shale and Bertie Formation (Canada), the Šárka Formation (Czech Republic),  Emu Bay Shale (Australia), Idaho and Utah (USA).  This is probably due to the rare occurrence of the right circumstances for soft tissue preservation, needed for these non-calcified exoskeletons. 

Northwest Passage<====>21215<====>Northwest Passage  The Northwest Passage  (abbreviated as NWP) is, from the European and northern Atlantic point of view, the sea route to the Pacific Ocean through the Arctic Ocean, along the northern coast of North America via waterways through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The eastern route along the Arctic coasts of Norway and Siberia is accordingly called Northeast Passage (NEP). The various islands of the archipelago are separated from one another and from the Canadian mainland by a series of Arctic waterways collectively known as the Northwest Passages or Northwestern Passages.  For centuries, European explorers sought a navigable passage as a possible trade route to Asia.

The ancestors of modern Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago, possibly much longer, from Asia through Beringia.  A vast variety of peoples, societies and cultures subsequently developed.  Native Americans were greatly affected by the European colonization of the Americas, which began in 1492, and their population declined precipitously due to introduced diseases, warfare, and slavery.

Nortel's 2009 bankruptcy case—the largest in Canadian history—left pensioners, shareholders and former employees with enormous losses while Nortel executives continued to draw "retention bonuses" totaling $190M US during the eight-year post-bankruptcy period. 

Nile<====>21244<====>Nile  The Nile ( ,  Egyptian Arabic  en-Nīl,  Standard Arabic  an-Nīl;  , P(h)iaro; Ancient Egyptian: Ḥ'pī and Jtrw; Biblical Hebrew: היאור, Ha-Ye'or or השיחור, Ha-Shiḥor) is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa, and is commonly regarded as the longest river in the world,   though some sources cite the Amazon River as the longest.  Amazon Longer Than Nile River, Scientists Say    The Nile, which is 6,853 km (4,258 miles) long, is an "international" river as its drainage basin covers eleven countries, namely, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Republic of the Sudan and Egypt. 

Neuroscience<====>21245<====>Neuroscience  Neuroscience (or neurobiology) is the scientific study of the nervous system.It is a multidisciplinary branch of biology,  that deals with the anatomy, biochemistry, molecular biology, and physiology of neurons and neural circuits.  It also draws upon other fields, with the most obvious being pharmacology, psychology, and medicine.  The scope of neuroscience has broadened over time to include different approaches used to study the molecular, cellular, developmental, structural, functional, evolutionary, computational, psychosocial and medical aspects of the nervous system.  Neuroscience has also given rise to such other disciplines as neuroeducation,  neuroethics, and neurolaw. 

Neil Armstrong<====>21247<====>Neil Armstrong    Neil Alden Armstrong (August 5, 1930 – August 25, 2012) was an American astronaut, engineer, and the first person to walk on the Moon.  He was also an aerospace engineer, naval aviator, test pilot, and university professor.  Before becoming an astronaut, Armstrong was an officer in the U. S.  Navy and served in the Korean War.  After the war, he earned his bachelor's degree at Purdue University and served as a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station, where he logged over 900 flights.  He later completed graduate studies at the University of Southern California. 

North Korea<====>21255<====>North KoreaNorth Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (abbreviated DPRK), is a country in East Asia constituting the northern part of the Korean Peninsula.  Pyongyang is the nation's capital and largest city.  To the north and northwest, the country is bordered by China and by Russia along the Amnok (known as the Yalu in China) and Tumen rivers;  it is bordered to the south by South Korea, with the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating the two.  Nevertheless, North Korea, like its southern counterpart, claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula. 

History of North Korea<====>21256<====>History of North Korea   The history of North Korea began with the partition of Korea at the end of World War II in 1945.  The surrender of Japan led to the division of Korea into two occupation zones, with the United States administering the southern half of the peninsula and the Soviet Union administering the area north of the 38th parallel. The Soviets and Americans were unable to agree on the implementation of Joint Trusteeship over Korea.  This led in 1948 to the establishment of two separate governments – the Communist-aligned Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the West-aligned Republic of Korea – each claiming to be the legitimate government of all of Korea. 

Geography of North Korea<====>21257<====>Geography of North Korea North Korea is located in east Asia on the northern half of the Korean Peninsula. North Korea shares a border with three countries; China along the Amnok River, Russia along the Tumen River, and South Korea along the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).  The Yellow Sea and the Korea Bay are off the west coast and the Sea of Japan (East Sea of Korea) is off the east coast. Most of North Korea is a series of medium-sized mountain ranges and large hills, separated by deep, narrow valleys.  The highest peak, Paektu-san on the volcanic Baekdu Mountain, is located on its northern border with China, and rises 9,002 ft. 

Demographics of North Korea<====>21258<====>Demographics of North Korea The demographics of North Korea are known through national censuses and international estimates.  The Central Bureau of Statistics of North Korea conducted the most recent census in 2008, where the population reached 24 million inhabitants.The population density is 199. 54 inhabitants per square kilometre, and the 2014 estimated life expectancy is 69. 81 years.  In 1980, the population rose at a near consistent, but low, rate (0. 84% from the two censuses).  Since 2000, North Korea's birth rate has exceeded its death rate; the natural growth is positive. 

Politics of North Korea<====>21259<====>Politics of North Korea The politics of North Korea takes place within the framework of the official state philosophy, Juche, a concept created by Hwang Jang-yop and later attributed to Kim Il-sung.  The Juche theory is the belief that through self-reliance and a strong independent state, true socialism can be achieved.B.  R.  Myers: The Cleanest Race: How North Koreans See Themselves and Why It Matters.  pp.  45–46.  Paperback edition.  (2011) North Korea's political system is built upon the principle of centralization.  While the North Korean constitution formally guarantees protection of human rights, in practice there are severe limits on freedom of expression, and the government closely supervises the lives of North Korean citizens. 

Economy of North Korea<====>21260<====>Economy of North Korea   North Korea's economy is a centrally planned system, where the role of market allocation schemes is limited, though increasing.   Although there have been some small-scale reforms,  , North Korea continues its basic adherence to a rigid centrally planned command economy, and its reliance on fundamentally non-pecuniary (not readily quantified or valued in money) incentives.  There has been economic reform, particularly after Kim Jong-un assumed the leadership in 2012, but reports conflict over particular legislation and enactment.   The collapse of the Eastern Bloc from 1989 to 1991, particularly North Korea's principal source of support, the Soviet Union, forced the North Korean economy to realign its foreign economic relations, including increased economic exchanges with South Korea. 

Telecommunications in North Korea<====>21261<====>Telecommunications in North KoreaTelecommunications in North Korea refers to the communication services available in North Korea.  North Korea has not fully adopted mainstream Internet technology due to its isolationist policies.  Telephone North Korea has an adequate telephone system, with 1. 18 million fixed lines available in 2008.   However, most phones are only installed for senior government officials.  Someone wanting a phone installed must fill out a form indicating their rank, why he wants a phone, and how he will pay for it.   Most of these are installed in government offices, collective farms, and state-owned enterprises (SOEs), with only perhaps 10 percent controlled by individuals or households. 

Transport in North Korea<====>21262<====>Transport in North KoreaTransport in North Korea is constrained by economic problems and government restrictions.  Public transport predominates, and most of it is electrified. Restrictions on freedom of movementTravel to North Korea is tightly controlled.  The standard route to and from North Korea is by plane or train via Beijing.  Transport directly to and from South Korea was possible on a limited scale from 2003 until 2008, when a road was opened (bus tours, no private cars).  Freedom of movement in North Korea is also limited,    as citizens are not allowed to move around freely inside their country. 

Korean People's Army<====>21263<====>Korean People's Army The Korean People's Army (KPA;  ) is an institution of the Workers' Party of Korea, and constitutes the de facto military force of North Korea.  Under the Songun policy, it is the central institution of North Korean society.  Kim Jong-un is the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army and Chairman of the Central Military Commission.  The KPA consists of five branches: Ground Force, the Navy, the Air Force, the Strategic Rocket Forces, and the Special Operation Force.   The Worker-Peasant Red Guards also come under control of the KPA. 

Foreign relations of North Korea<====>21264<====>Foreign relations of North Korea The foreign relations of North Korea – officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) – have been shaped by its conflict with capitalist countries like South Korea and its historical ties with world communism.  Both the government of the DPRK and the government of South Korea (officially the Republic of Korea) claim to be the government of the whole of Korea.  The Korean War in the 1950s failed to resolve the issue, leaving the DPRK locked in a military confrontation with South Korea and the United States Forces Korea across the Demilitarized Zone. 

Northern Ireland<====>21265<====>Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland (   ;  Ulster-Scots:  ) is a part of the United Kingdom in the north-east of the island of Ireland,   variously described as a country, province or region. Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland.  In 2011, its population was 1,810,863,  constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population.  Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. 

Nasjonal Samling<====>21267<====>Nasjonal Samling  Nasjonal Samling ( , National Union), abbreviated NS, was a Norwegian fascist party active from 1933 to 1945.  It was founded by former minister of defence Vidkun Quisling and a group of supporters such as Johan Bernhard Hjort who led the party's paramilitary wing (Hirden) for a short time before leaving the party in 1937 after various internal conflicts.  The party celebrated its founding on 17 May, Norway's national holiday, but was founded on 13 May 1933. Pre-war politicsThe party never gained direct political influence, but it made its mark on Norwegian politics nonetheless.  Despite the fact that it never managed to get more than 2. 

Nasreddin<====>21269<====>Nasreddin   Nasreddin or Nasreddin Hodja (  ) was a Seljuq satirical Sufi, born in Hortu Village in Sivrihisar, Eskişehir Province, present-day Turkey and died in 13th century in Akşehir, near Konya, a capital of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, in today's Turkey.   He is considered a populist philosopher and wise man, remembered for his funny stories and anecdotes.   He appears in thousands of stories, sometimes witty, sometimes wise, but often, too, a fool or the butt of a joke.  A Nasreddin story usually has a subtle humour and a pedagogic nature.The International Nasreddin Hodja festival is celebrated between the 5th and 10th of July in his hometown every year. 

Neutron<====>21272<====>Neutron   The neutron is a subatomic particle, symbol   or  , with no net electric charge and a mass slightly larger than that of a proton.  Protons and neutrons constitute the nuclei of atoms.  Since protons and neutrons behave similarly within the nucleus, and each has a mass of approximately one atomic mass unit, they are both referred to as nucleons.Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics. The chemical and nuclear properties of the nucleus are determined by the number of protons, called the atomic number, and the number of neutrons,called the neutron number. 

Neon<====>21273<====>Neon   Neon is a chemical element with symbol Ne and atomic number 10.  It is a noble gas.   Neon is a colorless, odorless, inert monatomic gas under standard conditions, with about two-thirds the density of air.  It was discovered (along with krypton and xenon) in 1898 as one of the three residual rare inert elements remaining in dry air, after nitrogen, oxygen, argon and carbon dioxide were removed.  Neon was the second of these three rare gases to be discovered and was immediately recognized as a new element from its bright red emission spectrum. 

Nickel<====>21274<====>Nickel  Nickel is a chemical element with symbol Ni and atomic number 28.  It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge.  Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile.  Pure nickel, powdered to maximize the reactive surface area, shows a significant chemical activity, but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms on the surface and prevents further corrosion (passivation).  Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks,   and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere. 

Niobium<====>21275<====>Niobium   Niobium, formerly columbium, is a chemical element with symbol Nb (formerly Cb) and atomic number 41.  It is a soft, grey, ductile transition metal, often found in the minerals pyrochlore and columbite.  Its name comes from Greek mythology, specifically Niobe, who was the daughter of Tantalus, the namesake of tantalum.  The name reflects the great similarity between the two elements in their physical and chemical properties, making them difficult to distinguish.  The English chemist Charles Hatchett reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 and named it columbium.  In 1809, the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston wrongly concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical. 

Neodymium<====>21276<====>Neodymium Neodymium is a chemical element with symbol Nd and atomic number 60.  It is a soft silvery metal that tarnishes in air.  Neodymium was discovered in 1885 by the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach.  It is present in significant quantities in the ore minerals monazite and bastnäsite.  Neodymium is not found naturally in metallic form or unmixed with other lanthanides, and it is usually refined for general use.  Although neodymium is classed as a rare earth, it is a fairly common element, no rarer than cobalt, nickel, or copper, and is widely distributed in the Earth's crust. 

Neptunium<====>21277<====>Neptunium Neptunium is a chemical element with symbol Np and atomic number 93.  A radioactive actinide metal, neptunium is the first transuranic element.  Its position in the periodic table just after uranium, named after the planet Uranus, led to it being named after Neptune, the next planet beyond Uranus.  A neptunium atom has 93 protons and 93 electrons, of which seven are valence electrons.  Neptunium metal is silvery and tarnishes when exposed to air.  The element occurs in three allotropic forms and it normally exhibits five oxidation states, ranging from +3 to +7.  It is radioactive, poisonous, pyrophoric, and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of neptunium dangerous. 

Nobelium<====>21278<====>Nobelium Nobelium is a synthetic chemical element with symbol No and atomic number 102.  It is named in honor of Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite and benefactor of science.  A radioactive metal, it is the tenth transuranic element and is the   member of the actinide series.  Like all elements with atomic number over 100, nobelium can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles.  A total of twelve nobelium isotopes are known to exist; the most stable is  259 No with a half-life of 58 minutes, but the shorter-lived  255 No (half-life 3. 

Norwegian Sea<====>21281<====>Norwegian Sea  The Norwegian Sea ( ) is a marginal sea in the Arctic Ocean, northwest of Norway.  It is located between the North Sea (i. e.  north of the United Kingdom) and the Greenland Sea and adjoins the Barents Sea to the northeast.  In the southwest, it is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a submarine ridge running between Iceland and the Faroe Islands.  To the North, the Jan Mayen Ridge separates it from the Greenland Sea. Unlike many other seas, most of the bottom of the Norwegian Sea is not part of a continental shelf and therefore lies at a great depth of about two kilometres on average. 

Nuclear physics<====>21285<====>Nuclear physics  Nuclear physics is the field of physics that studies atomic nuclei and their constituents and interactions.  Other forms of nuclear matter are also studied.    Nuclear physics should not be confused with atomic physics, which studies the atom as a whole, including its electrons. Discoveries in nuclear physics have led to applications in many fields.  This includes nuclear power, nuclear weapons, nuclear medicine and magnetic resonance imaging, industrial and agricultural isotopes, ion implantation in materials engineering, and radiocarbon dating in geology and archaeology.  Such applications are studied in the field of nuclear engineering. 

Nuremberg<====>21287<====>Nuremberg    Nuremberg ( ;  ;)is a city on the river Pegnitz and on the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal in the German state of Bavaria, in the administrative region of Middle Franconia, about   north of Munich.  It is the second-largest city in Bavaria (after Munich), and the largest in Franconia ( ).    it had a population of 517,498, making it Germany's fourteenth-largest city.  The urban area also includes Fürth, Erlangen and Schwabach, with a total population of 763,854.    the "European Metropolitan Area Nuremberg" had approximately 3. 

Nicholas Lemann<====>21288<====>Nicholas Lemann Nicholas Berthelot Lemann is the Joseph Pulitzer II and Edith Pulitzer Moore Professor of Journalism and Dean Emeritus of the Faculty of Journalism at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.   He has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1999.  Early lifeNicholas Lemann was born, raised, and educated in a Jewish family  in New Orleans.  He describes his family's faith as a "kind of super-Reform Judaism" where there were "no kosher laws, no bar mitzvahs, no tallit, no kippot".  EducationLemann was educated at Metairie Park Country Day School,    a private school in New Orleans, from which he graduated in 1972, followed by Harvard College, where he studied American history and literature, and was president of The Harvard Crimson, where he wrote the Brass Tacks column, and from which he graduated magna cum laude in 1976. 

Nautical mile<====>21289<====>Nautical mile A nautical mile is a unit of measurement defined as  .  Historically, it was defined as  one minute of latitude, which is equivalent to one sixtieth of a degree of latitude.  Today, it is a non-SI unit "accepted for use with the SI",  for its continued use in both air and marine navigation,  and for the definition of territorial waters.  One tenth of a nautical mile is a cable length.  The derived unit of speed is the knot, defined as one nautical mile per hour.  The geographical mile is the length of one minute of longitude along the Equator, about 1,855 m on the WGS 84 ellipsoid. 

N<====>21290<====>N    N (named en   ) is the 14th letter in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet. History  Egyptian hieroglyph  Phoenician  Nun Etruscan  N Greek  Nu  DOne of the most common hieroglyphs, snake, was used  in Egyptian writing to stand for a sound like the English  , because the Egyptian word for "snake" was djet.  It is speculated by many  that Semitic people working in Egypt adapted hieroglyphics to create the first alphabet, and that they used the same snake symbol to represent N, because their word for "snake" may have begun with that sound. 

Nail (fastener)<====>21291<====>Nail (fastener) In woodworking and construction, a nail is a pin-shaped object of metal (or wood, called a treenail or "trunnel") which is used as a fastener, as a peg to hang something, or sometimes as a decoration.   Generally, nails have a sharp point on one end and a flattened head on the other, but headless nails are available.  Nails are made in a great variety of forms for specialized purposes.  The most common is a wire nail.  Other types of nails include pins, tacks,  s, spikes, and cleats. Nails are typically driven into the workpiece by a hammer, a pneumatic nail gun, or a small explosive charge or primer. 

Namibia<====>21292<====>Namibia Namibia ( ,  ),   officially the Republic of Namibia (German:  ;  ) is a country in southern Africa whose western border is the Atlantic Ocean.  It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east.  Although it does not border Zimbabwe, less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates the two countries.  Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence. 

Geography of Namibia<====>21294<====>Geography of Namibia At  ,  Namibia is the world's thirty-fourth largest country (after Venezuela).  After Mongolia, Namibia is the second least densely populated country in the world ( ). Geographical areasThe Namibian landscape consists generally of five geographical areas, each with characteristic abiotic conditions and vegetation with some variation within and overlap between them: the Central Plateau, the Namib Desert, the Great Escarpment, the Bushveld, and the Kalahari Desert. Central PlateauThe Central Plateau runs from north to south, bordered by the Skeleton Coast to the northwest, the Namib Desert and its coastal plains to the southwest, the Orange River to the south, and the Kalahari Desert to the east. 

Demographics of Namibia<====>21295<====>Demographics of NamibiaThis article is about the demographic features of the population of Namibia, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population. PopulationCensus results As required by the Namibian Statistics Act #66 of 1976, and in accordance with United Nations recommendations, a census is conducted every ten years.  After Namibian independence the first Population and Housing Census was carried out in 1991, further rounds followed in 2001 and 2011.The data collection method is to count every person resident in Namibia on the census' reference night, wherever they happen to be. 

Politics of Namibia<====>21296<====>Politics of Namibia    Politics of Namibia takes place in a framework of a semi-presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Namibia is both head of state and head of government,  and of a pluriform multi-party system.  Executive power is exercised by both the President and the Government.  Legislative power is vested in both the Government and the two chambers of Parliament.  The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. Additional to the government political structure Namibia has a network of traditional leadership with currently 51 recognised traditional authorities and their leaders. 

Economy of Namibia<====>21297<====>Economy of Namibia   The Namibian economy has a modern market sector, which produces most of the country's wealth, and a traditional subsistence sector.   Although the majority of the population engages in subsistence agriculture and herding, Namibia has more than 200,000 skilled workers and a considerable number of well-trained professionals and managerials.  OverviewNamibia is a higher middle income country with an estimated annual GDP per capita of US$5,828 but has extreme inequalities in income distribution and standard of living.   It leads the list of countries by income inequality with a Gini coefficient of 70.

Since Independence in 1990, Namibia has seen a dramatic growth in radio stations, with both commercial (for instance Radio 99, Radio Wave, Radio Energy, Omulunga Radio, West Coast FM, etc. 

Transport in Namibia<====>21299<====>Transport in NamibiaThis article deals with the system of transport in Namibia, both public and private. GeneralHistoryThe beginnings of organised travel and transport routes in the territory of South West Africa, today Namibia, have not yet been established.  This is due to the lack of any written records relating to roads prior to the twilight of the 19th century.   Archaeological work has dated one stretch of road in the south-western Brandberg Massif to   1250 AD.  Although no other such early examples have been found, it is certain that this road was not the only one of its kind. 

Namibian Defence Force<====>21300<====>Namibian Defence Force  The Namibian Defence Force was created when South West Africa gained full independence from South Africa in 1990.  The constitution of Namibia defines the role of the military as "defending the territory and national interests. "Namibia's military was born from the integration of the formerly belligerent People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), military wing of the South West African People's Organization, and the South West African Territorial Force (SWATF) - a security arm of the former South African administration.  The British formulated the force integration plan and began training the NDF, which consists of five battalions and a small headquarters element. 

Foreign relations of Namibia<====>21301<====>Foreign relations of Namibia   Namibia follows a largely independent foreign policy, with strong affiliations with states that aided the independence struggle, including Libya and Cuba.In Africa, Namibia has been involved in conflicts in neighbouring Angola as well as the Democratic Republic of Congo.International organizationsNamibia is a member of 47 international organizations.

This affected the Angolan Civil War that has been ongoing since Angola's independence in 1975. Namibias ruling party SWAPO wanted to support the ruling party MPLA in Angola to fight the rebel movement UNITA, whose stronghold is in southern Angola, bordering Namibia. The defence pact allowed Angolan troops to use Namibian territory when attacking UNITA.The alliance between SWAPO and MPLA has deep roots and began as both Angola's and Namibia's ruling parties sought independence during the mid twentieth century and into the Angolan Civil War. In Angola, the leftist movement MPLA was fighting the rightist movement UNITA, which was supported by South Africa. In Namibia, SWAPO, then being a rebel movement, was fighting for independence from South Africa along the Angolan border. Angola allowed SWAPO to establish training and refugee camps for Namibians and PLAN (People's Liberation Army of Namibia) fighters. As MPLA and SWAPO shared a common ideological ground, and had a common enemy in South Africa, they came to cooperate.The Angolan civil war resulted in a large number of Angolan refugees coming to Namibia. At its peak in 2001 there were over 30,000 Angolan refugees in Namibia. The calmer situation in Angola has made it possible for many of them to return to their home with the help of UNHCR, and in 2004 only 12,600 remained in Namibia.   Most of them reside in the refugee camp Osire north of Windhoek.    2 October 2006 Diplomatic relations between Armenia and Namibia were established on 2 October 2006. See Botswana–Namibia relationsBotswana–Namibia relations are friendly, with the two neighbouring countries cooperating on economic development. Botswana gained independence from Britain in September 1966. Namibia gained independence from South Africa in 1990 following the Namibian War of Independence. Botswana has a high commission in Windhoek.  Namibia has a high commission in Gaborone. See Canada–Namibia relationsCanada's relationship with Namibia began in 1977 when Canada joined the Western Contact Group, a joint diplomatic effort of France, United Kingdom, United States, Canada and West Germany to bring an internationally acceptable transition to independence for Namibia. In 1990 official relations started; Canada has dispatched a Honorary Consul to Windhoek. Canada-Namibia relations Foreign Ministry of Canada Canada is one of the main destinations for Namibian refugees. Together with Botswana and Denmark, Canada has been granting asylum to people fleeing Namibia in the aftermath of the Caprivi conflict, and particularly the Caprivi treason trial that followed in which the Namibian government was accused of human rights violations.    Only in 2010 Canada has changed its standpoint and is now considering the CLA to be a terrorist organisation that has "attempted to usurp an elected government". Nonetheless, Canada received a steady inflow of Namibian immigrants who seek economic betterment under the pretense of humiliation and harassment in Namibia. In 2011 more than 1,000 Namibians entered Canada. Three-quarters of them applied for refugee status, but only a few were successful. See China–Namibia relationsGovernmental relations were first established the day after Namibia's independence, but relations with Namibian independence movements date back to the 1960s. Interpretation of China-Namibia Relations in Foreign Ministry of the People's Republic of China  China and Namibia have developed close economic relations, with trade increasing twofold between the two countries from 2003–2006. During a February 2007 visit, Chinese President Hu Jintao pledged Namibia "RMB 1 billion of concessional loans, 100 million US dollars of preferential export buyer's credit, RMB 30 million yuan of grants and RMB 30 million of interest-free loans..." Diplomatic relations between Croatia and Namibia were established on 22 June 1998.

Along with numerous other African nations, Namibia intervened in the Second Congo War, sending troops in support of the Democratic Republic of Congo's president Laurent-Désiré Kabila. It is not clear why Namibia intervened in the conflict, although it has been suggested that Namibia was interested in Congo's natural resources, especially copper.   Namibia's decision to join the conflict resulted in criticism from opposition parties, the public, as well as from within the ruling party SWAPO.Namibia maintains an embassy in Addis Ababa. During the South African occupation of Namibia, Ethiopia was one of the country's leading proponents abroad; Ethiopia and Liberia were the first two states to bring the question of independence for then South West Africa to the United Nations. In 2007, the two governments signed an agreement which expanded air travel between the two states.

In the 1880s the German Empire came to what is now Namibia as a colonizing power, creating German South-West Africa. The German colonial rule was marked by tensions and led to the genocide of the Herero and Namaqua people from 1904–1907, which resulted in the deaths of 65,000 Herero (80 percent of the total Herero population), and 10,000 Nama (50% of the total Nama population). The colony was ruled by Germany until 1915 when it was conquered by troops from the Union of South Africa.During South African rule, German was one of the three official languages of Namibia, the others being Afrikaans and English. Likewise during Apartheid rule, West Germany maintained a consulate in Windhoek despite United Nations resolutions calling for the isolation of South Africa.Namibian independence in 1990 coincided with German reunification, resulting in an initially slow development of diplomatic relations. However, in both 1989 and 2004 the German government acknowledged its responsibility for Namibia as a priority partner country.  Since then German Development minister Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul visited Namibia, asking the country for forgiveness of the past.  Today, not least due to substantially improved co-operation and exchange, as well as by fate of the permanent presence of the "German tribe in Namibia", the two countries have mostly learnt to a new dialogue, which at times also still stagnates.Greece is represented in Namibia through its embassy in Nairobi, Kenya.

Namibia maintained a battalion of about 800 personnel in Grand Cape Mount county for several years, for most of the period part of UNMIL Sector 2, headquartered at Tubmanburg. In May 2005, Namibian troops were accused of sexual exploitation of young girls and women; three Namibian soldiers were sent home from the force after a United Nations investigation found them guilty of "engaging in sexual activity with civilians", which is against United Nations rules for peacekeepers. On 21 December 2011 Macedonia and Namibia established diplomatic relations at ambassadorial level when the Ambassadors of both countries to the UN, Pajo Avirovic and Wilfried Emvula respectively, signed the joint communiqué.

See Namibia – South Africa relationsUpon independence in 1990, Namibia's economy was still tied to South Africa's.  To this day, the economy of Namibia is still closely contacted to South Africa through both institutional relationships (Southern African Customs Union, for example) and privately owned mining concessions.  The South African rand is still legal currency within Namibia, while the Namibian dollar is not so in South Africa and the currencies are traded on par locally.    21 March 1990 Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between the Republic of Korea and Namibia is 21 March 1990 and Number of South Koreans living in Namibia (2011): 15.

Nauru<====>21302<====>Nauru Nauru ( ,or ), officially the Republic of Nauru  ( ) and formerly known as Pleasant Island, is an island country in Micronesia in the Central Pacific.  Its nearest neighbour is Banaba Island in Kiribati,   to the east.  It further lies northwest of Tuvalu, north of the Solomon Islands, east-northeast of Papua New Guinea, southeast of the Federated States of Micronesia and south of the Marshall Islands.  With   residents in a   area, Nauru is the smallest state in the South Pacific, smallest republic and third smallest state by area in the world, behind only Vatican City and Monaco. 

History of Nauru<====>21303<====>History of Nauru   The history of human activity in Nauru, an island country in the Pacific Ocean, began roughly 3,000 years ago when 12 Micronesian and Polynesian clans settled the island. Early historyNauru was first settled by Micronesian and Polynesian peoples at least 3,000 years ago.  Nauru Department of Economic Development and Environment.  2003.  First National Report To the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) URL Accessed 2006-05-03    Nauruans subsisted on coconut and pandanus fruit, and engaged in aquaculture by catching juvenile ibija fish, acclimated them to freshwater conditions, and raised them in Buada Lagoon, providing an additional reliable source of food. 

Geography of Nauru<====>21304<====>Geography of Nauru  Nauru is a tiny phosphate rock island nation located in the South Pacific Ocean south of the Marshall Islands in Oceania.  It is only   south of the Equator at coordinates  .  Nauru is one of the three great phosphate rock islands in the Pacific Ocean — the others are Banaba (Ocean Island) in Kiribati and Makatea in French Polynesia. Its land area is  , and it has a  .  Maritime claims are a 200-nautical-mile (370 km) exclusive fishing zone, and a 12-nautical-mile (22 km) territorial sea. The climate is tropical with a monsoonial rainy season from November to February. 

Demographics of Nauru<====>21305<====>Demographics of Nauru   The demographics of Nauru, an island country in the Pacific Ocean, are known through national censuses, which have been analysed by various statistical bureaus since the 1920s.  The Nauru Bureau of Statistics have conducted this task since 1977—the first census since Nauru gained independence in 1968.  The most recent census of Nauru was in 2011, when population had reached ten thousand.  The population density is 478 inhabitants per square kilometre (185 per square mile), and the overall life expectancy is 59. 7 years.  The population rose steadily from the 1960s until 2006 when the Government of Nauru repatriated thousands of Tuvaluan and I-Kiribati workers from the country. 

Politics of Nauru<====>21306<====>Politics of Nauru   Politics of Nauru takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Nauru is the head of government of the executive branch.  Legislative power is vested in both the government and the parliament.  The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. Political conditionsBackground Nauru's economic viability has historically rested on its phosphate reserves.  Phosphate — in actuality a resource derived from a 1,000-year cycle of bird droppings—has been mined on the island since 1906.  In the 20th century, the small Pacific nation generated healthy revenues from this lucrative—but finite—resource. 

Economy of Nauru<====>21307<====>Economy of Nauru  The economy of Nauru is tiny, based on a population in 2014 of only 11,000 people.   The economy is primarily based on phosphate mining, offshore banking, and processing of coconut products.  Mining of phosphate ceased after the exhaustion of the primary phosphate reserves, but in 2006–07 mining of a deeper layer of "secondary phosphate" began.  It is hoped that this economic activity might lift Nauru from the bottom rung of global GDP per capita.  The only other major source of government revenue is sale of fishing rights in Nauru's territorial waters. 

Telecommunications in Nauru<====>21308<====>Telecommunications in Nauru Nauru has one government-owned radio station and two television stations.

Economy of New Caledonia<====>21347<====>Economy of New Caledonia New Caledonia is a major source for nickel and contains roughly 10% of the worlds known nickel supply.  The islands contain about 7,100,000 tonnes of nickel.  With the annual production of about 107,000 tonnes in 2009, New Caledonia was the world's fifth largest producer after Russia (266,000), Indonesia (189,000), Canada (181,000) and Australia (167,000).In recent years, the economy has suffered because of depressed international demand for nickel, due to the ongoing global financial crisis.  Only a negligible amount of the land is suitable for cultivation, and food accounts for about 20% of imports.

Transport in Nigeria<====>21390<====>Transport in NigeriaDecaying infrastructure is one of the deficiencies that Nigeria's National Economic Empowerment Development Strategy (NEEDS) seeks to address.   The government has begun to repair the country’s poorly maintained road network.  Because Nigeria's railways are BITEin a perilous condition, the government is trying to rectify the situation by privatizing the Nigerian Railway Corporation.  Similarly, the government is pursuing a strategy of partial port privatization by granting concessions to private port operators so that they can improve the quality of port facilities and operations.

History of Niue<====>21393<====>History of NiueNiue was first settled by Polynesian sailors from Samoa in around 900 AD.  Further settlers (or invaders) arrived from Tonga in the 16th century.  Early historyUntil the beginning of the 18th century, there appears to have been no national government or national leader in Niue.  Before that time, chiefs and heads of family exercised authority over segments of the population.  Around 1700, the concept and practice of kingship appears to have been introduced through contact with Samoa  or Tonga.  From then on, a succession of patu-iki (kings) ruled the island, the first of whom was Puni-mata. 

Geography of Niue<====>21394<====>Geography of NiueNiue is a small island in the South Pacific Ocean, to the east of Tonga.   It has an area of 260 square kilometres, and a coastline of 64 km.   It claims an exclusive economic zone of 200 nm, and a territorial sea of 12 nm.   It is one of world's largest coral islands. ClimateNiue's climate is tropical, modified by south-east trade winds.   Cyclones pose a natural hazard. TerrainThe terrain consists of steep coastal cliffs made from limestone and a central plateau.   The lowest point is at sea level, and the highest is an unnamed point near Mutalau settlement, at 68 m. 

Politics of Niue<====>21396<====>Politics of Niue Politics of Niue takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic dependency, whereby the Chief Minister is the head of government, and of a non-partisan system.  Niue is self-governing in free association with New Zealand and is fully responsible for internal affairs.  New Zealand retains some responsibility for external affairs, in consultation with Niue.  The Niue Constitution Act 1974 (NZ) vests executive authority in Her Majesty the Queen in Right of New Zealand and the Governor-General of New Zealand.  The constitution specifies that in everyday practice, it is exercised by a Cabinet of the Premier of Niue and three other ministers.

Northern Mariana Islands<====>21402<====>Northern Mariana IslandsThe Northern Mariana Islands, officially the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI;  ; Refaluwasch or Carolinian: Commonwealth Téél Falúw kka Efáng llól Marianas), is an insular area and commonwealth of the United States consisting of 15 islands in the northwestern Pacific Ocean.  The CNMI includes all islands in the Mariana Archipelago except Guam which is the southernmost island of the chain and a separate U. S.  territory. The United States Department of the Interior cites a landmass of  .   According to the 2010 United States Census, 53,883 people were living in the CNMI at that time. 

Geography of the Northern Mariana Islands<====>21404<====>Geography of the Northern Mariana IslandsThis article is about the geography of the Northern Mariana Islands. The Northern Mariana Islands, together with Guam to the south, compose the Mariana Islands.  The southern islands are limestone, with level terraces and fringing coral reefs.  The northern islands are volcanic, with active volcanoes on Anatahan, Pagan and Agrihan.  The volcano on Agrihan has the highest elevation at  .  About one-fifth of the land is arable; another tenth is pasture.  The primary natural resource is fish, some of which are endangered species, which leads to conflict.  Also, development has created landfills which have contaminated the groundwater on Saipan, which could lead to disease.

Politics of the Northern Mariana Islands<====>21406<====>Politics of the Northern Mariana Islands Politics of the Northern Mariana Islands takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic system, whereby the Governor is head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system.  The Northern Mariana Islands are a commonwealth in political union with the United States.  Executive power is exercised by the governor.  Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of the legislature.  The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.  Local government is carried out through three regional mayors. The Northern Mariana Islands and the United States of America reached a Covenant Agreement which became fully effective on November 4, 1986. 

Norfolk Island<====>21422<====>Norfolk Island    Norfolk Island ( ; Norfuk: Norf'k Ailen ) is a small island in the Pacific Ocean located between Australia, New Zealand, and New Caledonia,   directly east of mainland Australia's Evans Head, and about   from Lord Howe Island.  The island is part of the Commonwealth of Australia.  Together with two neighbouring islands, it forms one of Australia's external territories.  At the 2016 Australian census, it has 1,748 inhabitants living on a total area of about  .Its capital is Kingston. Norfolk Island was first settled by East Polynesians but was long unpopulated when it was eventually also settled by Great Britain as part of its settlement of Australia from 1788. 

History of Norfolk Island<====>21423<====>History of Norfolk Island  The history of Norfolk Island dates back to the fourteenth or fifteenth century when it was settled by Polynesian seafarers. Early historyNorfolk Island was first settled by East Polynesian seafarers either from the Kermadec Islands north of New Zealand or from the North Island of New Zealand.  They arrived in the fourteenth or fifteenth century, and survived for several generations before disappearing.  Their main village site has been excavated at Emily Bay, and they also left behind stone tools, the Polynesian rat, and banana trees as evidence of their sojourn.  The harakeke (Phormium tenax), or New Zealand flax plant, was brought to Norfolk Island either from New Zealand directly or from Raoul Island (Sunday Island) by these Polynesian settlers. 

Politics of Norfolk Island<====>21426<====>Politics of Norfolk Island   Politics of Norfolk Island takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic entity.  Norfolk Island is the only non-mainland Australian territory to have achieved self-governance.  The Norfolk Island Act 1979, passed by the Parliament of Australia in 1979, is the Act under which the island is governed. In a move that apparently surprised many islanders the Chief Minister of Norfolk Island David Buffett announced on 6 November 2010 that the island would voluntarily surrender its tax free status in return for a financial bailout from the federal government to cover significant debts. 

New Testament<====>21433<====>New Testament  The New Testament ( , Hē Kainḕ Diathḗkē;  ) is the second part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible.  The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity.  Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture.  The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world.  It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. 

Nerve<====>21435<====>Nerve  A nerve is an enclosed, cable-like bundle of axons (nerve fibers, the long and slender projections of neurons) in the peripheral nervous system.  A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses that are transmitted along each of the axons to peripheral organs. In the central nervous system, the analogous structures are known as tracts.    Neurons are sometimes called nerve cells, though this term is potentially misleading since many neurons do not form nerves, and nerves also include non-neuronal Schwann cells that coat the axons in myelin. 

Negligence<====>21436<====>Negligence  Negligence (Lat.  negligentia)  is a failure to exercise the appropriate and or ethical ruled care expected to be exercised amongst specified circumstances.   The area of tort law known as negligence involves harm caused by failing to act as a form of carelessness possibly with extenuating circumstances.  The core concept of negligence is that people should exercise reasonable care in their actions, by taking account of the potential harm that they might foreseeably cause to other people or property.  Someone who suffers loss caused by another's negligence may be able to sue for damages to compensate for their harm. 

Niger River<====>21437<====>Niger River    The Niger River ( ;  ,  ) is the principal river of West Africa, extending about  .   Its drainage basin is   in area.   Its source is in the Guinea Highlands in southeastern Guinea.  It runs in a crescent through Mali, Niger, on the border with Benin and then through Nigeria, discharging through a massive delta, known as the Niger Delta or the Oil Rivers, into the Gulf of Guinea in the Atlantic Ocean.   The Niger is the third-longest river in Africa, exceeded only by the Nile and the Congo River (also known as the Zaïre River). 

Neutral monism<====>21440<====>Neutral monismIn the philosophy of mind, neutral monism is the view that the mental and the physical are two ways of organizing or describing the same elements, which are themselves "neutral", that is, neither physical nor mental.    This view denies that the mental and the physical are two fundamentally different things.  Rather, neutral monism claims the universe consists of only one kind of stuff, in the form of neutral elements that are in themselves neither mental nor physical. HistoryNeutral monism about the mind–body relationship is described by C.  D.  Broad in one of his earlier works, The Mind and Its Place in Nature. 

Necronomicon<====>21442<====>Necronomicon   The Necronomicon is a fictional grimoire (textbook of magic) appearing in the stories by horror writer H.  P.  Lovecraft and his followers.  It was first mentioned in Lovecraft's 1924  short story "The Hound",  written in 1922, though its purported author, the "Mad Arab" Abdul Alhazred, had been quoted a year earlier in Lovecraft's "The Nameless City".   Among other things, the work contains an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them. Other authors such as August Derleth and Clark Ashton Smith also cited it in their works; Lovecraft approved, believing such common allusions built up "a background of evil verisimilitude. 

Neal Stephenson<====>21443<====>Neal Stephenson  Neal Town Stephenson (born October 31, 1959) is an American writer and game designer known for his works of speculative fiction. His novels have been categorized as science fiction, historical fiction, cyberpunk, postcyberpunk, and baroque. Stephenson's work explores subjects such as mathematics, cryptography, linguistics, philosophy, currency, and the history of science.  He also writes non-fiction articles about technology in publications such as Wired.  He has also written novels with his uncle, George Jewsbury ("J.  Frederick George"), under the collective pseudonym Stephen Bury. Stephenson has worked part-time as an advisor for Blue Origin, a company (funded by Jeff Bezos) developing a manned sub-orbital launch system, and is also a cofounder of Subutai Corporation, whose first offering is the interactive fiction project The Mongoliad. 

Niccolò Machiavelli<====>21444<====>Niccolò Machiavelli  Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli ( ; 3 May 1469 – 21 June 1527) was an Italian diplomat, politician, historian, philosopher, humanist, and writer of the Renaissance period.    He has often been called the father of modern political science.   He was for many years a senior official in the Florentine Republic, with responsibilities in diplomatic and military affairs.  He also wrote comedies, carnival songs, and poetry.  His personal correspondence is renowned in the Italian language.  He was secretary to the Second   of the Republic of Florence from 1498 to 1512, when the Medici were out of power. 

November<====>21445<====>NovemberNovember is the eleventh and penultimate month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian Calendars and the fourth and last month to have the length of 30 days.   November was the ninth month of the ancient Roman calendar.  November retained its name (from the Latin novem meaning "nine") when January and February were added to the Roman calendar. November is a month of late spring in the Southern Hemisphere and late autumn in the Northern Hemisphere.  Therefore, November in the Southern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent of May in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.

Chamberlain is best known for his foreign policy of appeasement and in particular for his signing of the Munich Agreement in 1938, conceding the German-speaking Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia to Germany.  However, when Adolf Hitler later invaded Poland, the UK declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939 and Chamberlain led Britain through the first eight months of World War II. 

Nicanor Parra<====>21454<====>Nicanor Parra  Nicanor Segundo Parra Sandoval (born September 5, 1914) is a Chilean poet, mathematician, and physicist.  He is considered an influential poet in Chile and throughout Latin America.  Some rank him among the most important poets of Spanish language literature.   Parra describes himself as an "anti-poet," due to his distaste for standard poetic pomp and function; after recitations he exclaims "Me retracto de todo lo dicho" ("I take back everything I said"). LifeParra, the son of a schoolteacher, was born in 1914 in San Fabián de Alico, Chile, near Chillán in southern Chile.

Normal distribution<====>21462<====>Normal distribution    In probability theory, the normal (or Gaussian) distribution is a very common continuous probability distribution.  Normal distributions are important in statistics and are often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known.    A random variable with a Gaussian distribution is said to be normally distributed and is called a normal deviate.  The normal distribution is useful because of the central limit theorem.  In its most general form, under some conditions (which include finite variance), it states that averages of samples of observations of random variables independently drawn from independent distributions converge in distribution to the normal, that is, become normally distributed when the number of observations is sufficiently large. 

Niklas Luhmann<====>21465<====>Niklas Luhmann Niklas Luhmann (December 8, 1927 – November 6, 1998) was a German sociologist, philosopher of social science, and a prominent thinker in systems theory, who is increasingly recognized as one of the most important social theorists of the 20th century.  BiographyLuhmann was born in Lüneburg, Lower Saxony, where his father's family had been running a brewery for several generations.  After graduating from the Johanneum school in 1943, he was conscripted as a Luftwaffenhelfer in World War II and served for two years until, at the age of 17, he was taken prisoner of war by American troops in 1945.

She has since released seven solo albums and been a part of numerous collaborations. 

List of national anthems<====>21470<====>List of national anthems Most nation-states have anthems, defined as "a song, as of praise, devotion, or patriotism";  most anthems are either marches or hymns in style.  A hymn can become a national anthem by a provision in the state's constitution, by a law enacted by its legislature, or simply by tradition.A royal anthem is a patriotic song similar to a national anthem, but it specifically praises or prays for a monarch or royal dynasty.  Such anthems are usually performed at public appearances by the monarch or during other events of royal importance. 

Nikola Tesla<====>21473<====>Nikola Tesla Nikola Tesla ( ;; 10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American    inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist, and futurist who is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.  Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla received an advanced education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry.  He emigrated to the United States in 1884, where he would become a naturalized citizen. 

Natural number<====>21474<====>Natural number In mathematics, the natural numbers are those used for counting (as in "there are six coins on the table") and ordering (as in "this is the third largest city in the country").   In common language, words used for counting are "cardinal numbers" and words used for ordering are "ordinal numbers". Some definitions, including the standard ISO 80000-2,  begin the natural numbers with  , corresponding to the non-negative integers  , whereas others start with 1, corresponding to the positive integers  . include zero in the natural numbers: 'Intuitively, the set   of all natural numbers may be described as follows:   contains an "initial" number 0; . 

Natural logarithm<====>21476<====>Natural logarithm The natural logarithm of a number is its logarithm to the base of the mathematical constant e, where e is an irrational and transcendental number approximately equal to  .  The natural logarithm of x is generally written as  ,  ,  or sometimes, if the base e is implicit, simply  .   Parentheses are sometimes added for clarity, giving ln(x), log e (x) or log(x).  This is done in particular when the argument to the logarithm is not a single symbol, to prevent ambiguity. The natural logarithm of x is the power to which e would have to be raised to equal x. 

Neogene<====>21477<====>Neogene  The Neogene ( )   is a geologic period and system that spans 20. 45 million years from the end of the Paleogene Period   million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the present Quaternary Period   Mya.  The Neogene is sub-divided into two epochs, the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene.  Some geologists assert that the Neogene cannot be clearly delineated from the modern geological period, the Quaternary. During this period, mammals and birds continued to evolve into roughly modern forms, while other groups of life remained relatively unchanged.  Early hominids, the ancestors of humans, appeared in Africa near the end of the period. 

Notary public<====>21481<====>Notary public   A notary public (or notary or public notary) of the common law is a public officer constituted by law to serve the public in non-contentious matters usually concerned with estates, deeds, powers-of-attorney, and foreign and international business.  A notary's main functions are to administer oaths and affirmations, take affidavits and statutory declarations, witness and authenticate the execution of certain classes of documents, take acknowledgments of deeds and other conveyances, protest notes and bills of exchange, provide notice of foreign drafts, prepare marine or ship's protests in cases of damage, provide exemplifications and notarial copies, and perform certain other official acts depending on the jurisdiction. 

Nairobi<====>21482<====>Nairobi   Nairobi ( ;  ) is the capital and largest city of Kenya.  The name comes from the Maasai phrase Enkare Nyrobi, which translates to "cool water", a reference to the Nairobi River which flows through the city.  The city proper has a population of 3,138,369, while the metropolitan area has a population of 6,547,547.  The city is popularly referred to as the Green City in the Sun.   Nairobi was founded in 1899 by the colonial authorities in British East Africa, as a rail depot on the Uganda Railway.  Roger S. 

Numeral (linguistics)<====>21483<====>Numeral (linguistics)  In linguistics, a numeral is a member of a word class characterized by the designation of numbers; some examples are the English word 'two' and the compound 'seventy-seventh'.    Numerals function most typically as an adjective or a pronoun and express numbers and relations to numbers for example: quantity, sequence, frequency, or fraction.    Identifying numerals Numerals may be attributive, as in two dogs, or pronominal, as in I saw two (of them). Many words of different parts of speech indicate number or quantity.  Such words are called Quantifiers.  Examples are words such as every, most, least, some, etc. 

Neutrino<====>21485<====>Neutrino   A neutrino (  or  ) (denoted by the Greek letter ν) is a fermion (an elementary particle with half-integer spin) that interacts only via the weak subatomic force and gravity.    The mass of the neutrino is much smaller than that of the other known elementary particles.   Although only differences of squares of the three mass values are known as of 2016,    cosmological observations imply that the sum of the three masses must be less than one millionth that of the electron.  The neutrino is so named because it is electrically neutral and because its rest mass is so small (-ino) that it was long thought to be zero. 

Nanotechnology<====>21488<====>Nanotechnology   Nanotechnology ("nanotech") is  manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale.  The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology   referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology.  A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers.  This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold. 

NetHack<====>21489<====>NetHack  NetHack is a single-player roguelike video game originally released in 1987 with ASCII graphics.  It is a descendant of an earlier game called Hack ( ), which is a clone of Rogue ( ).   Comparing it with Rogue, Engadget s Justin Olivetti wrote that it took its exploration aspect and "made it far richer with an encyclopedia of objects, a larger vocabulary, a wealth of pop culture mentions, and a puzzler's attitude. "  In 2000, Salon described it as "one of the finest gaming experiences the computing world has to offer. "   The player chooses a character race and class for the mission of retrieving the Amulet of Yendor in a randomly generated dungeon. 

Nylon<====>21490<====>Nylon   Nylon 6,6  Density 1. 15 g/cm 3  Electrical conductivity (σ) 10 −12  S/m Thermal conductivity 0. 25 W/(m·K) Melting point 463–624 K  190–350 °C  374–663 °F Nylon is a generic designation for a family of synthetic polymers, based on aliphatic or semi-aromatic polyamides.  Nylon is a thermoplastic silky material    that can be melt-processed into fibers, films or shapes.Nylon was the first commercially successful synthetic thermoplastic polymer.   DuPont began its research project in 1930. The first example of nylon (nylon 6,6) was produced  using diamines on February 28, 1935, by Wallace Carothers at DuPont's research facility at the DuPont Experimental Station. 

Nerd<====>21494<====>Nerd  A nerd is a person seen as overly intellectual, obsessive, or lacking social skills (introvert).  Such a person may spend inordinate amounts of time on unpopular, little known, or non-mainstream activities, which are generally either highly technical, abstract, or relating to topics of fiction or fantasy, to the exclusion of more mainstream activities.  Additionally, many so-called nerds are described as being shy, quirky, pedantic, and unattractive.  Originally derogatory, the term "nerd" was a stereotype, but as with other pejoratives, it has been reclaimed and redefined by some as a term of pride and group identity. 

Nucleic acid<====>21496<====>Nucleic acidNucleic acids are biopolymers, or small biomolecules, essential to all known forms of life.  They are composed of nucleotides, which are monomers made of three components: a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group and a nitrogenous base.  If the sugar is a simple ribose, the polymer is RNA (ribonucleic acid); if the sugar is derived from ribose as deoxyribose, the polymer is DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Nucleic acids are the most important of all biomolecules.  They are found in abundance in all living things, where they function to create and encode and then store information in the nucleus of every living  cell of every life-form organism on Earth. 

Nitrate<====>21497<====>Nitrate  Nitrate is a polyatomic ion with the molecular formula   and a molecular mass of 62. 0049 u.  Nitrates also describe the organic functional group RONO 2 .  These nitrate esters are a specialized class of explosives. StructureThe anion is the conjugate base of nitric acid, consisting of one central nitrogen atom surrounded by three identically bonded oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement.  The nitrate ion carries a formal charge of −1.  This results from a combination formal charge in which each of the three oxygens carries a −  charge, whereas the nitrogen carries a +1 charge, all these adding up to formal charge of the polyatomic nitrate ion.

Kidman began her acting career in Australia with the 1983 film Bush Christmas.  She was a lead in BMX Bandits also in 1983.  Her breakthrough came in 1989 with the thriller Dead Calm and the television miniseries Bangkok Hilton.  In 1990, she made her Hollywood debut in the racing film Days of Thunder, opposite Tom Cruise. 

Nucleotide<====>21505<====>NucleotideNucleotides are organic molecules that serve as the monomer units for forming the nucleic acid polymers deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), both of which are essential biomolecules in all life-forms on Earth.  Nucleotides are the building blocks of nucleic acids; they are composed of three subunit molecules: a nitrogenous base, a five-carbon sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), and at least one phosphate group.  They are also known as phosphate nucleotides. A nucleo side  is a nitrogenous base and a 5-carbon sugar.  Thus a nucleo side  plus a phosphate group yields a nucleo tide . 

Numerical analysis<====>21506<====>Numerical analysis  Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation (as opposed to general symbolic manipulations) for the problems of mathematical analysis (as distinguished from discrete mathematics). One of the earliest mathematical writings is a Babylonian tablet from the Yale Babylonian Collection (YBC 7289), which gives a sexagesimal numerical approximation of the square root of 2, the length of the diagonal in a unit square.  Being able to compute the sides of a triangle (and hence, being able to compute square roots) is extremely important, for instance, in astronomy, carpentry and construction.  Numerical analysis continues this long tradition of practical mathematical calculations. 

Noosphere<====>21508<====>Noosphere The noosphere ( ; sometimes noösphere) is the sphere of human thought.  Georgy S.  Levit: Biogeochemistry, Biosphere, Noosphere: The Growth of the Theoretical System of Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky (1863-1945)The word derives from the Greek νοῦς (nous "mind") and σφαῖρα  (sphaira "sphere"), in lexical analogy to "atmosphere" and "biosphere".  "[. . . ]he defined noosphere as the 'thinking envelope of the biosphere' and the 'conscious unity of souls'" David H.  Lane, 1996, "The phenomenon of Teilhard: prophet for a new age" p.  4  It was introduced by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin in 1922  in his Cosmogenesis. 

Niccolò Paganini<====>21511<====>Niccolò Paganini   Niccolò (or Nicolò) Paganini ( ; 27 October 1782 27 May 1840) was an Italian violinist, violist, guitarist, and composer.  He was the most celebrated violin virtuoso of his time, and left his mark as one of the pillars of modern violin technique.  His 24 Caprices for Solo Violin Op.  1 are among the best known of his compositions, and have served as an inspiration for many prominent composers. BiographyChildhoodNiccolò Paganini was born in Genoa, then capital of the Republic of Genoa, the third of the six children of Antonio and Teresa (née Bocciardo) Paganini. 

North Atlantic Current<====>21512<====>North Atlantic Current The North Atlantic Current (NAC), also known as North Atlantic Drift and North Atlantic Sea Movement, is a powerful warm western boundary current that extends the Gulf Stream north-eastward.    The NAC originates from where the Gulf Stream turns north at the Southeast Newfoundland Rise, a submarine ridge that stretches south-east from the Grand Banks.   The NAC flows northward east of the Grand Banks, from 40°N to 51°N, before turning sharply east to cross the Atlantic.   It transports more warm tropical water to northern latitudes than any other boundary current; more than 40 Sv in the south and 20 Sv as it crosses the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. 

North Atlantic Deep Water<====>21513<====>North Atlantic Deep Water North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) is a deep water mass formed in the North Atlantic Ocean.   Thermohaline circulation of the world's oceans involves the flow of warm surface waters from the southern hemisphere into the North Atlantic.   Water flowing northward becomes modified through evaporation and mixing with other water masses, leading to increased salinity.   When this water reaches the North Atlantic it cools and sinks through convection, due to its decreased temperature and increased salinity resulting in increased density.   NADW is the outflow of this thick deep layer, which can be detected by its high salinity, high oxygen content, nutrient minima, high  14 C/ 12 C,    and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). 

Nanomedicine<====>21514<====>Nanomedicine    Nanomedicine is the medical application of nanotechnology.  Nanomedicine, Volume I: Basic Capabilities, by Robert A.  Freitas Jr.  1999,    Nanomedicine ranges from the medical applications of nanomaterials and biological devices, to nanoelectronic biosensors, and even possible future applications of molecular nanotechnology such as biological machines.  Current problems for nanomedicine involve understanding the issues related to toxicity and environmental impact of nanoscale materials (materials whose structure is on the scale of nanometers, i. e.  billionths of a meter). Functionalities can be added to nanomaterials by interfacing them with biological molecules or structures. 

Null set<====>21520<====>Null set In set theory, a null set  N \subset \mathbb{R}  is a set that can be covered by a countable union of intervals of arbitrarily small total length.  The notion of null set in set theory anticipates the development of Lebesgue measure since a null set necessarily has measure zero.  More generally, on a given measure space  M = (X, \Sigma, \mu)  a null set is a set  S \subset X  such that  \mu(S) = 0 . DefinitionSuppose  A  is a subset of the real line  \mathbb{R}  such that  \forall \epsilon > 0 \ \exists \{U_n \} (A \subset \bigcup_1 ^\infty U_n \ \and \ \sum_1^\infty |U_n|  where the U n  are intervals and |U| is the length of U, then A is a null set. 

November 24<====>21522<====>November 24Events380 – Theodosius I makes his adventus, or formal entry, into Constantinople. 1227 – Polish Prince Leszek the White is assassinated at an assembly of Piast dukes at Gąsawa. 1248 – In the middle of the night a mass on the north side of Mont Granier suddenly collapsed, in one of the largest historical rockslope failures known in Europe. 1429 – Hundred Years' War: Joan of Arc unsuccessfully besieges La Charité. 1542 – Battle of Solway Moss: An English army defeats a much larger Scottish force near the River Esk in Dumfries and Galloway. 

Artificial neural network<====>21523<====>Artificial neural network   Artificial neural networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.  Such systems learn (progressively improve performance on) tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming.  For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as "cat" or "no cat" and using the results to identify cats in other images.  They do this without any a priori knowledge about cats, e. g. , that they have fur, tails, whiskers and cat-like faces. 

Nutrition<====>21525<====>Nutrition  Nutrition is the science that interprets the interaction of nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance, growth, reproduction, health and disease of an organism.  It includes food intake, absorption, assimilation, biosynthesis, catabolism, and excretion.  The diet of an organism is what it eats,  which is largely determined by the availability and palatability of foods.  For humans, a healthy diet includes preparation of food and storage methods that preserve nutrients from oxidation, heat or leaching, and that reduce risk of foodborne illness. In humans, an unhealthy diet can cause deficiency-related diseases such as blindness, anemia, scurvy, preterm birth, stillbirth and cretinism,    or nutrient excess health-threatening conditions such as obesity   and metabolic syndrome;  and such common chronic systemic diseases as cardiovascular disease,  diabetes,   and osteoporosis. 

November 22<====>21526<====>November 22In the ancient astronomy, it is the cusp day between Scorpio and Sagittarius.  In some years it is Sagittarius, but others Scorpio. Events498 – After the death of Anastasius II, Symmachus is elected Pope in the Lateran Palace, while Laurentius is elected Pope in Santa Maria Maggiore.  845 – The first duke of Brittany, Nominoe, defeats the Frankish king Charles the Bald at the Battle of Ballon near Redon. 1307 – Pope Clement V issues the papal bull Pastoralis Praeeminentiae which instructed all Christian monarchs in Europe to arrest all Templars and seize their assets. 

Number theory<====>21527<====>Number theory Number theory or, in older usage, arithmetic is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers.  It is sometimes called "The Queen of Mathematics" because of its foundational place in the discipline.   Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (e. g. , rational numbers) or defined as generalizations of the integers (e. g. , algebraic integers). Integers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations (Diophantine geometry).  Questions in number theory are often best understood through the study of analytical objects (e. 

Nitroglycerin<====>21530<====>Nitroglycerin  Nitroglycerin (NG), also known as nitroglycerine, trinitroglycerin (TNG), trinitroglycerine, nitro, glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), or 1,2,3-trinitroxypropane, is a heavy, colorless, oily, explosive liquid most commonly produced by nitrating glycerol with white fuming nitric acid under conditions appropriate to the formation of the nitric acid ester.  Chemically, the substance is an organic nitrate compound rather than a nitro compound, yet the traditional name is often retained.  Invented in 1847, nitroglycerin has been used as an active ingredient in the manufacture of explosives, mostly dynamite, and as such it is employed in the construction, demolition, and mining industries.  Since the 1880s, it has been used by the military as an active ingredient, and a gelatinizer for nitrocellulose, in some solid propellants, such as cordite and ballistite. 

Navy<====>21533<====>Navy  A navy or maritime force is a fleet of waterborne military vessels (watercraft) and its associated naval aviation, both sea-based and land-based.  It is the branch of a nation's armed forces principally designated for naval and amphibious warfare; namely, lake-borne, riverine, littoral, or ocean-borne combat operations and related functions.  It includes anything conducted by surface ships, amphibious ships, submarines, and seaborne aviation, as well as ancillary support, communications, training, and other fields.  The strategic offensive role of a navy is projection of force into areas beyond a country's shores (for example, to protect sea-lanes, ferry troops, or attack other navies, ports, or shore installations). 

Normed vector space<====>21538<====>Normed vector spaceIn mathematics, a normed vector space is a vector space over the real or complex numbers, on which a norm is defined.  A norm is the formalization and the generalization to real vector spaces of the intuitive notion of distance in the real world.  A norm is a real-valued function defined on the vector space that has the following properties:The zero vector, 0, has zero length; every other vector has a positive length.  \|x\|\geq 0 , and  \|x\|= 0  if and only if  x=0 Multiplying a vector by a positive number changes its length without changing its direction. 

Nicene Creed<====>21541<====>Nicene Creed  The Nicene Creed (Greek:   or,  , Latin:  ) is a Symbol of faith widely used in Christian liturgy.  It is called Nicene   because it was originally adopted in the city of Nicaea (present day İznik, Turkey) by the First Council of Nicaea in 325.  Readings in the History of Christian Theology by William Carl Placher 1988   pages 52–53  In 381, it was amended at the First Council of Constantinople, and the amended form is referred to as the Nicene or the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. The Oriental Orthodox and Assyrian churches use this profession of faith with the verbs in the original plural ("we believe") form, but the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic churches convert those verbs to the singular ("I believe"). 

Nuclear fusion<====>21544<====>Nuclear fusion    In nuclear physics, nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei come close enough to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles (neutrons or protons).  The difference in mass between the reactants and products is manifested as the release of large amounts of energy.  This difference in mass arises due to the difference in atomic "binding energy" between the atomic nuclei before and after the reaction.  Fusion is the process that powers active or "main sequence" stars, or other high magnitude stars. A fusion process that produces a nucleus lighter than iron-56 or nickel-62 will generally yield a net energy release. 

National Geographic Society<====>21550<====>National Geographic Society   The National Geographic Society (NGS), headquartered in Washington, D. C. , United States, is one of the largest non-profit scientific and educational institutions in the world.   Founded in 1888, its interests include geography, archaeology and natural science, the promotion of environmental and historical conservation, and the study of world culture and history.  The National Geographic Society’s logo is a yellow portrait frame – rectangular in shape – which appears on the margins surrounding the front covers of its magazines and as its television channel logo.  In partnership with 21st Century Fox, the Society operates the magazine, TV channels, a website that features extra content and worldwide events, and other media operations. 

Norns<====>21556<====>Norns  The Norns ( , plural:  ) in Norse mythology The article Dis in Nordisk familjebok (1907).   are female beings who rule the destiny of gods and men.  They roughly correspond to other controllers of humans' destiny, such as the Fates, elsewhere in European mythology. In Snorri Sturluson's interpretation of the Völuspá,  Urðr (Wyrd), Verðandi and Skuld, the three most important of the Norns, come out from a hall standing at the Well of Urðr or Well of Fate.  They draw water from the well and take sand that lies around it, which they pour over Yggdrasill so that its branches will not rot. 

Niflheim<====>21557<====>Niflheim  Niflheim (or Niflheimr) ("Mist Home", the "Abode of Mist" or "Mist World"  , or probably world of the darkness according to the Oxford English Dictionary ) is one of the Nine Worlds and is a location in Norse mythology which sometimes overlaps with the notions of Niflhel and Hel.  The name Niflheimr only appears in two extant sources: Gylfaginning and the much-debated Hrafnagaldr Óðins. Niflheim was primarily a realm of primordial ice and cold, with the frozen rivers of Élivágar and the well of Hvergelmir, from which come all the rivers.   According to Gylfaginning, Niflheim was one of the two primordial realms, the other one being Muspelheim, the realm of fire.

The NYSE trading floor is located at 11 Wall Street and is composed of 21 rooms used for the facilitation of trading. 

Nanoengineering<====>21561<====>Nanoengineering Nanoengineering is the practice of engineering on the nanoscale.  It derives its name from the nanometre, a unit of measurement equalling one billionth of a meter. Nanoengineering is largely a synonym for nanotechnology, but emphasizes the engineering rather than the pure science aspects of the field. Degree programs The first nanoengineering program  was started at the University of Toronto within the Engineering Science program as one of the options of study in the final years.  In 2003, the Lund Institute of Technology started a program in Nanoengineering.  In 2004, the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering at SUNY Polytechnic Institute was established on the campus of the University at Albany. 

NP (complexity)<====>21562<====>NP (complexity)  In computational complexity theory, NP (for nondeterministic polynomial time) is a complexity class used to describe certain types of decision problems.   Informally, NP is the set of all decision problems for which the instances where the answer is "yes" have efficiently verifiable proofs.  More precisely, these proofs have to be verifiable by deterministic computations that can be performed in polynomial time.  Equivalently, the formal definition of NP is the set of decision problems solvable in polynomial time by a theoretical non-deterministic Turing machine.  This second definition is the basis for the abbreviation NP, which stands for "nondeterministic, polynomial time.

Noam Chomsky<====>21566<====>Noam Chomsky  Avram Noam Chomsky (   ; born December 7, 1928) is an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian, social critic, and political activist.  Sometimes described as "the father of modern linguistics," Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science.  He is the author of over 100 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media.  Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.  He holds a joint appointment as Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and laureate professor at the University of Arizona. 

Nial<====>21571<====>Nial   Nial (from "Nested Interactive Array Language") is a high-level array programming language developed from about 1981 by Mike Jenkins of Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.   Jenkins co-created the Jenkins–Traub algorithm. Nial combines a functional programming notation for arrays based on an array theory developed by Trenchard More with structured programming concepts for numeric, character and symbolic data. It is most often used for prototyping and artificial intelligence. Q'NialIn 1982, Jenkins formed a company (Nial Systems Ltd) to market the language and the Q'Nial implementation of Nial.  As of 2014, the company website supports an Open Source project for the Q'Nial software with the binary and source available for download.

Niels Henrik Abel<====>21573<====>Niels Henrik Abel  Niels Henrik Abel ( ; 5 August 1802 – 6 April 1829) was a Norwegian mathematician who made pioneering contributions in a variety of fields.  His most famous single result is the first complete proof demonstrating the impossibility of solving the general quintic equation in radicals.  This question was one of the outstanding open problems of his day, and had been unresolved for 250 years.  He was also an innovator in the field of elliptic functions, discoverer of Abelian functions.  Despite his achievements, Abel was largely unrecognized during his lifetime; he made his discoveries while living in poverty and died at the age of 26.

Nicolaus von Amsdorf<====>21582<====>Nicolaus von AmsdorfNicolaus von Amsdorf (German: Nikolaus von Amsdorf, 3 December 1483 – 14 May 1565) was a German Lutheran theologian and reformer. BiographyHe was born in Torgau, on the Elbe. He was educated at Leipzig, and then at Wittenberg, where he was one of the first who matriculated (1502) in the recently founded university.  He soon obtained various academic honours, and became professor of theology in 1511. Like Andreas Karlstadt, he was at first a leading exponent of the older type of scholastic theology, but under the influence of Luther abandoned his Aristotelian positions for a theology based on the Augustinian doctrine of grace. 

Nationality<====>21583<====>Nationality  Nationality is a legal relationship between an individual person and a state. Nationality affords the state jurisdiction over the person and affords the person the protection of the state.  What these rights and duties are varies from state to state.  Weis, Paul.  Nationality and Statelessness in International Law.  BRILL; 1979 [cited 19 August 2012].   .  p.  29–61.  By custom and international conventions, it is the right of each state to determine who its nationals are.   Such determinations are part of nationality law. 

Nereus<====>21585<====>Nereus  In Greek mythology, Nereus ( ;  ) was the eldest son of Pontus (the Sea) and Gaia (the Earth),  who with Doris fathered the Nereids and Nerites, with whom Nereus lived in the Aegean Sea.  EtymologyR.  S.  P.  Beekes suggests a Pre-Greek origin.  MythologyIn the Iliad  the Old Man of the Sea is the father of Nereids, though Nereus is not directly named.  He was never more manifestly the Old Man of the Sea than when he was described, like Proteus, as a shapeshifter with the power of prophecy, who would aid heroes such as Heracles  who managed to catch him even as he changed shapes. 

Nereid<====>21586<====>Nereid In Greek mythology, the Nereids (   ;   Nereides, sg.    Nereis) are sea nymphs (female spirits of sea waters), the 50 daughters of Nereus and Doris, sisters to Nerites.   They often accompany Poseidon, the god of the sea, and can be friendly and helpful to sailors, like the Argonauts in their search for the Golden Fleece.    MythologyNereids are particularly associated with the Aegean Sea, where they dwelt with their father Nereus in the depths within a golden palace.The most notable of them are Thetis, wife of Peleus and mother of Achilles; Amphitrite, wife of Poseidon; and Galatea, the vain love interest of the Cyclops Polyphemus. 

Nereid (moon)<====>21588<====>Nereid (moon) Nereid is the third-largest moon of Neptune.  It has a highly eccentric orbit.  It was the second moon of Neptune to be discovered, by Gerard Kuiper in 1949. Discovery and namingNereid was discovered on 1 May 1949 by Gerard P.  Kuiper on photographic plates taken with the 82-inch telescope at the McDonald Observatory.  He proposed the name in the report of his discovery.  It is named after the Nereids, sea-nymphs of Greek mythology and attendants of the god Neptune.   It was the second and last moon of Neptune to be discovered before the arrival of Voyager 2 (not counting a single observation of an occultation by Larissa in 1981). 

Netball<====>21592<====>Netball    Netball is a ball sport played by two teams of seven players.  Its development, derived from early versions of basketball, began in England in the 1890s.  By 1960, international playing rules had been standardised for the game, and the International Federation of Netball and Women's Basketball (later renamed the International Netball Federation (INF)) was formed.  As of 2011, the INF comprises more than 60 national teams organized into five global regions. Games are played on a rectangular court with raised goal rings at each end.  Each team attempts to score goals by passing a ball down the court and shooting it through its goal ring. 

Njörðr<====>21594<====>Njörðr In Norse mythology, Njörðr is a god among the Vanir.

Niger–Congo languages<====>21601<====>Niger–Congo languages The Niger–Congo languages constitute one of the world's major language families and Africa's largest in terms of geographical area, number of speakers and number of distinct languages.  Irene Thompson, “Niger-Congo Language Family”, ”aboutworldlanguages”, March 2015  It is generally considered to constitute the world's largest language family in terms of distinct languages,   although this is complicated by the ambiguity about what constitutes a distinct language. It is the third largest language family in the world by number of native speakers.  One of the characteristics common to most Niger–Congo languages is the use of a noun class system.

Other nearby settlements on the Nanay River include the villages of Santo Tomás, Padre Cocha, and Santa Clara.  During periods when the river is low, the many beaches along the Nanay are popular destinations.  The Nanay belongs entirely to the lowlands, and is very crooked, has a slow current and divides into many canos  and strings of lagoons which flood the flat, low areas of country on either side. 

Nine-ball<====>21609<====>Nine-ballNine-ball (sometimes written 9-ball) is a contemporary form of pool (pocket billiards), with historical beginnings rooted in the United States and traceable to the 1920s.   The game may be played in social and recreational settings by any number of players (generally one-on-one) and subject to whatever rules are agreed upon beforehand, or in league and tournament settings in which the number of players and the rules are set by the sponsors.  During much of its history, nine-ball has been known as a "money game" in both professional and recreational settings, but has since become established as a legitimate alternative to eight ball, straight pool and other major competition games.

Nation state<====>21627<====>Nation state  A nation-state (hyphenated or not) in the most specific sense is a country where a distinct cultural or ethnic group (a "nation" or "people") inhabit a territory and have formed a state (often a sovereign state) that they predominantly govern.   A nation, in the sense of a common ethnicity, may include a diaspora or refugees who live outside the nation-state; some nations of this sense do not have a state where that ethnicity predominates.   In a more general sense, a nation-state is simply a large, politically sovereign country or administrative territory.   A nation-state may be contrasted with:A multinational state, where no one ethnic group dominates (may also be considered a multicultural state depending on the degree of cultural assimilation of various groups).

Five years into his reign, he had her murdered. 

Neoclassical economics<====>21634<====>Neoclassical economics  Neoclassical economics is an approach to economics focusing on the determination of goods, outputs, and income distributions in markets through supply and demand.  This determination is often mediated through a hypothesized maximization of utility by income-constrained individuals and of profits by firms facing production costs and employing available information and factors of production, in accordance with rational choice theory.  Neoclassical economics dominates microeconomics, and together with Keynesian economics forms the neoclassical synthesis which dominates mainstream economics today.  Clark, B.  (1998).  Principles of political economy: A comparative approach.  Westport, Connecticut: Praeger.    Although neoclassical economics has gained widespread acceptance by contemporary economists, there have been many critiques of neoclassical economics, often incorporated into newer versions of neoclassical theory.

New Year<====>21637<====>New Year New Year is the time or day at which a new calendar year begins and the calendar's year count  increments by one. Many cultures celebrate the event in some manner  and the 1st day of January is often marked as a national holiday. In the Gregorian calendar, the most widely used calendar system today, New Year occurs on January 1 (New Year's Day).  This was also the case both in the Roman calendar (at least after about 713 BCE) and in the Julian calendar that succeeded it. Other calendars have been used historically in different parts of the world; some calendars count years numerically, while others do not.

Low-alcohol beer<====>21640<====>Low-alcohol beerLow-alcohol beer (also called light beer, non-alcoholic beer, small beer, small ale, or near-beer) is beer with little or no alcohol content , which aims to reproduce the taste of beer without the inebriating effects of standard alcoholic brews.  Most low-alcohol beers are lagers, but there are some low-alcohol ales. In the United States, beverages containing less than 0. 5% alcohol by volume (ABV) were legally called non-alcoholic, according to the now-defunct Volstead Act.  Because of its very low alcohol content,  non-alcoholic beer may be legally sold to minors in many American states. In the United Kingdom, the following definitions apply by law (correct as of May 2007): No alcohol or alcohol-free: not more than 0.

Nitric acid<====>21655<====>Nitric acid Nitric acid (HNO 3 ), also known as aqua fortis and spirit of niter, is a highly corrosive mineral acid. The pure compound is colorless, but older samples tend to acquire a yellow cast due to decomposition into oxides of nitrogen and water.  Most commercially available nitric acid has a concentration of 68% in water.  When the solution contains more than 86% HNO 3 , it is referred to as fuming nitric acid.  Depending on the amount of nitrogen dioxide present, fuming nitric acid is further characterized as white fuming nitric acid or red fuming nitric acid, at concentrations above 95%. 

Nihilism<====>21663<====>Nihilism  Nihilism (  or  ; from the Latin  , nothing) is a philosophical doctrine that suggests the lack of belief in one or more reputedly meaningful aspects of life.

Moral nihilists assert that there is no inherent morality, and that accepted moral values are abstractly contrived.  Nihilism may also take epistemological, ontological, or metaphysical forms, meaning respectively that, in some aspect, knowledge is not possible, or reality does not actually exist. 

Nebula<====>21664<====>Nebula A nebula (Latin for "cloud" or "fog";  pl.  nebulae, nebulæ, or nebulas) is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases.   Originally, nebula was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way.  The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the Andromeda Nebula (and spiral galaxies in general as "spiral nebulae") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others. Most nebulae are of vast size, some are hundreds of light years in diameter. 

Natural theology<====>21665<====>Natural theology Natural theology, once also termed physico-theology, is a type of theology that provides arguments for the existence of God based on reason and ordinary experience of nature.  This distinguishes it from revealed theology, which is based on scripture and/or religious experiences, and also from transcendental theology, which is based on a priori reasoning. Marcus Terentius Varro (116 BC – 27 BC) established a distinction between political theology (the social functions of religion), natural theology and mythical theology.  His terminology became part of the Stoic tradition and then Christianity through St.  Augustine and St.  Thomas Aquinas.

The genera Rabdiophrys, Pinaciophora, and Pompholyxophrys, freshwater forms with hollow siliceous scales or spines, were formerly included in Nucleariida, but are now placed in Rhizaria.In the past, nucleariids were included among the heliozoa as the Rotosphaerida. 

North American English<====>21673<====>North American English  North American English (NAmE, NAE) is the most generalized variety of the English language as spoken in the United States and Canada.   Because of their related histories and cultures    and the similarities between the pronunciation, vocabulary, and accent of American English and Canadian English, the two spoken dialects are often grouped together under a single category. Due to historical and cultural factors, Canadian English and American English retain numerous distinctions from each other, with the differences being most noticeable in the two languages' written forms.  Canadian spellings are primarily based on British usage as a result of Canada's longer-standing connections with the United Kingdom.

No wave<====>21692<====>No wave  No wave was a short-lived avant-garde scene that emerged in the late 1970s in downtown New York City.    In partial reaction against punk rock's recycling of traditionalist rock and roll clichés, no wave musicians instead experimented with noise, dissonance and atonality in addition to a variety of non-rock genres, including free jazz and funk, while often reflecting an abrasive, confrontational and nihilistic worldview.    In the later years of the scene, it adopted a more playful, danceable aesthetic inspired by disco, early hip hop and world music sources.

Norwegian language<====>21704<====>Norwegian language  Norwegian (norsk) is a North Germanic language spoken mainly in Norway, where it is the official language.  Along with Swedish and Danish, Norwegian forms a dialect continuum of more or less mutually intelligible local and regional variants. These Scandinavian languages, together with Faroese and Icelandic as well as some extinct languages, constitute the North Germanic languages.  Faroese and Icelandic are hardly mutually intelligible with Norwegian in their spoken form because continental Scandinavian has diverged from them. As established by law and governmental policy, the two official forms of written Norwegian are Bokmål (literally "book tongue") and Nynorsk (literally "new Norwegian"). 

Non-standard analysis<====>21708<====>Non-standard analysisThe history of calculus is fraught with philosophical debates about the meaning and logical validity of fluxions or infinitesimal numbers.  The standard way to resolve these debates is to define the operations of calculus using epsilon–delta procedures rather than infinitesimals.  Non-standard analysis    instead reformulates the calculus using a logically rigorous notion of infinitesimal numbers. Non-standard analysis was originated in the early 1960s by the mathematician Abraham Robinson.    He wrote: [. . . ] the idea of infinitely small or infinitesimal quantities seems to appeal naturally to our intuition.  At any rate, the use of infinitesimals was widespread during the formative stages of the Differential and Integral Calculus.

Nerve agent<====>21710<====>Nerve agent   Nerve agents are a class of phosphorus-containing organic chemicals (organophosphates) that disrupt the mechanisms by which nerves transfer messages to organs.  The disruption is caused by blocking acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. Poisoning by a nerve agent leads to contraction of pupils, profuse salivation, convulsions, involuntary urination and defecation, and death by asphyxiation due to a loss of control of the respiratory muscles.  Some nerve agents are readily vaporized or aerosolized, and the primary portal of entry into the body is the respiratory system.  Nerve agents can also be absorbed through the skin, requiring that those likely to be subjected to such agents wear a full body suit in addition to a respirator.

Nonlinear optics<====>21723<====>Nonlinear opticsNonlinear optics (NLO) is the branch of optics that describes the behavior of light in nonlinear media, that is, media in which the dielectric polarization P responds nonlinearly to the electric field E of the light.  The nonlinearity is typically observed only at very high light intensities (values of the electric field comparable to interatomic electric fields, typically 10 8  V/m) such as those provided by lasers.  Above the Schwinger limit, the vacuum itself is expected to become nonlinear.  In nonlinear optics, the superposition principle no longer holds. Nonlinear optics remained unexplored until the discovery in 1961 of second-harmonic generation by Peter Franken et al.

B. , Witchcraft Today, p. 75, London:Rider, 1954  whereas Alex Sanders, the founder of the Gardnerian offshoot, Alexandrian Wicca, came out as bisexual later in life and created new rituals in which sexual orientation was irrelevant.   Newer Wiccan traditions do not usually hold to this historical aversion to LGBT-friendly approaches to Wicca. 

Nation<====>21754<====>Nation  A nation is a stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, ethnicity and/or psychological make-up manifested in a common culture.

It is a cultural-political community that has become conscious of its autonomy, unity, and particular interests.    Black's Law Dictionary defines a nation as: Ernest Renan's What is a Nation? (1882) declares that "race is confused with nation and a sovereignty analogous to that of really existing peoples is attributed to ethnographic or, rather linguistic groups", and "The truth is that there is no pure race and that to make politics depend upon ethnographic analysis is to surrender it to a chimera", echoing a sentiment of civic nationalism.

Nociception<====>21781<====>NociceptionNociception (also nocioception or nociperception, from Latin nocere 'to harm or hurt') is the sensory nervous system's response to certain harmful or potentially harmful stimuli.  In nociception, intense chemical (e. g. , chili powder in the eyes), mechanical (e. g. , cutting, crushing), or thermal (heat and cold) stimulation of sensory nerve cells called nociceptors produces a signal that travels along a chain of nerve fibers via the spinal cord to the brain.   Nociception triggers a variety of physiological and behavioral responses and usually results in a subjective experience of pain in sentient beings.    Detection of noxious stimuliPotentially damaging mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli are detected by nerve endings called nociceptors, which are found in the skin, on internal surfaces such as the periosteum, joint surfaces, and in some internal organs. 

Nova<====>21784<====>Nova A nova (plural   or novas) or classical nova (CN or plural CNe) is a transient astronomical event that causes the sudden appearance of a bright, apparently "new" star, that slowly fades over several weeks or many months.  Novae involve an interaction between two stars that cause the flareup that is perceived as a new entity that is much brighter than the stars involved. Causes of the dramatic appearance of a nova vary, depending on the circumstances of the two progenitor stars.   All novae involve closely located binary stars (the progenitors), either a pair of red dwarfs in the process of merging, or a white dwarf and another star.

Nagasaki<====>21790<====>Nagasaki  {{Infobox settlement }}   ( ) is the capital and the largest city of Nagasaki Prefecture on the island of Kyushu in Japan.  The city's name, 長崎, means "Long Cape" in Japanese.  Nagasaki became a centre of colonial Portuguese and Dutch influence in the 16th through 19th centuries, and Churches and Christian Sites in Nagasaki have been proposed for inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List.  Part of Nagasaki was home to a major Imperial Japanese Navy base during the First Sino-Japanese War and Russo-Japanese War. During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack. 

Nanjing<====>21791<====>NanjingNanjing ( ), formerly romanized as Nanking and Nankin,  is the capital of Jiangsu province of the People's Republic of China and the second largest city in the East China region,  with an administrative area of   and a total population of 8,270,500  .   The inner area of Nanjing enclosed by the city wall is Nanjing City ( ), with an area of  , while the Nanjing Metropolitan Region includes surrounding cities and areas, covering over  , with a population of over 30 million. Situated in the Yangtze River Delta region, Nanjing has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having served as the capital of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments dating from the 3rd century to 1949,    and has thus long been a major center of culture, education, research, politics, economy, transport networks and tourism, being the home to one of the world's largest inland ports. 

Ninth Fort<====>21793<====>Ninth FortThe Ninth Fort ( ) is a stronghold in the northern part of Šilainiai elderate, Kaunas, Lithuania.  It is a part of the Kaunas Fortress, which was constructed in the late 19th century.  During the occupation of Kaunas and the rest of Lithuania by the Soviet Union, the fort was used as a prison and way-station for prisoners being transported to labour camps.  After the occupation of Lithuania by Nazi Germany, the fort was used as a place of execution for Jews, captured Soviets, and others.    HistoryAt the end of the 19th century the city of Kaunas was fortified and by 1890 was encircled by eight forts and nine gun batteries. 

Nostratic languages<====>21794<====>Nostratic languages Nostratic  is a macrofamily, or hypothetical large-scale language family, which includes many of the indigenous language families of Eurasia, although its exact composition and structure vary among proponents.  It typically comprises the Indo-European, Uralic, Altaic and Kartvelian languages, as well as the Afroasiatic languages spoken in North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the Near East, and the Dravidian languages of the Indian Subcontinent (sometimes also Elamo-Dravidian, which connects India and the Iranian Plateau). The hypothetical ancestral language of the Nostratic family is called Proto-Nostratic.   Proto-Nostratic would have been spoken between 15,000 and 12,000 BCE, in the Epipaleolithic period, close to the end of the last glacial period. 

Namespace<====>21796<====>Namespace In computing, a namespace is a set of symbols that are used to organize objects of various kinds, so that these objects may be referred to by name.  Prominent examples include:file systems are namespaces that assign names to files; some programming languages organize their variables and subroutines in namespaces;   computer networks and distributed systems assign names to resources, such as computers, printers, websites, (remote) files, etc. Namespaces are commonly structured as hierarchies to allow reuse of names in different contexts.  As an analogy, consider a system of naming of people where each person has a proper name, as well as a family name shared with their relatives. 

Nahum<====>21797<====>Nahum Nahum (  or  ;   Naḥūm) was a minor prophet whose prophecy is recorded in the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament.

Newfoundland English<====>21803<====>Newfoundland EnglishNewfoundland English is a name for several accents and dialects of English found in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.   Most of these differ substantially from the English commonly spoken elsewhere in Canada and the North Atlantic.   Many Newfoundland dialects are influenced by the West Country dialects of the West Country in England, particularly the city of Bristol and counties Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Hampshire and Somerset, while others are influenced by dialects of Ireland's southeast, particularly Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny and Cork.  Still others blend elements of both and there is also a Scottish   influence on the dialects – while the Scottish came in smaller numbers than the English and Irish, they had a large influence on Newfoundland society. 

National flag<====>21804<====>National flagA national flag is a flag that symbolizes a country.  The flag is flown by the government, but usually can also be flown by citizens of the country. History Historically, flags originate as military standards, used as field signs.  The practice of flying flags indicating the country of origin outside of the context of warfare became common with the maritime flag, introduced during the age of sail, in the early 17th century.  The origins of the Union Jack flag date back to 1603, when James VI of Scotland inherited the English and Irish thrones (as James I), thereby uniting the crowns of England, Scotland and Ireland in a personal union (which remained separate states).

Noble Eightfold Path<====>21815<====>Noble Eightfold Path    The Noble Eightfold Path ( ,  )  is an early summary of the path of Buddhist practices leading to liberation from samsara, the painful cycle of rebirth.   The Eightfold Path consists of eight practices: right view, right resolve, right speech, right conduct, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right samadhi ('meditative absorption or union').   In early Buddhism, these practices started with insight (right view), culminating in dhyana or samadhi as the core soteriological practice.   In later Buddhism, insight (Prajñā) became the central soteriological instrument, leading to a different concept and structure of the path. 

National park<====>21818<====>National park  A national park is a park in use for conservation purposes.  Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns.  Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride.   An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas, has defined "National Park" as its Category II type of protected areas. While this type of national park had been proposed previously, the United States established the first "public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people", Yellowstone National Park, in 1872. 

Papal diplomacy<====>21819<====>Papal diplomacyNuncio (officially known as an Apostolic nuncio and also known as a papal nuncio) is the title for an ecclesiastical diplomat, being an envoy or permanent diplomatic representative of the Holy See to a state or international organization.  A nuncio is appointed by and represents the Holy See, and is the head of the diplomatic mission, called an Apostolic Nunciature, which is the equivalent of an embassy.  The Holy See is legally distinct from the Vatican City or the Catholic Church.  A nuncio is usually an archbishop. A papal nuncio is generally equivalent in rank to that of ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary, although in Catholic countries the nuncio often ranks above ambassadors in diplomatic protocol. 

Newlyn School<====>21820<====>Newlyn SchoolThe Newlyn School was an art colony of artists based in or near Newlyn, a fishing village adjacent to Penzance, Cornwall, from the 1880s until the early twentieth century.   The establishment of the Newlyn School was reminiscent of the Barbizon School in France, where artists fled Paris to paint in a more pure setting emphasizing natural light.   These schools along with a related California movement were also known as En plein air. Newlyn had a number of things guaranteed to attract artists: fantastic light, cheap living, and the availability of inexpensive models.  The artists were fascinated by the fishermen's working life at sea and the everyday life in the harbour and nearby villages. 

Natural Law Party<====>21822<====>Natural Law Party   The Natural Law Party (NLP) is a transnational party founded in 1992 on "the principles of Transcendental Meditation",    the laws of nature, and their application to all levels of government.At its peak, it was active in up to 74 countries; it continues in India and some parts of the United States.  The party defines "natural law" as the organizing intelligence which governs the natural universe.   The Natural Law Party advocates using the Transcendental Meditation technique and the TM-Sidhi program as tools to enliven natural law and reduce or eliminate problems in society. 

Naturalistic fallacy<====>21826<====>Naturalistic fallacy  In philosophical ethics, the term "naturalistic fallacy" was introduced by British philosopher G.  E.  Moore in his 1903 book Principia Ethica.   Moore argues it would be fallacious to explain that which is good reductively in terms of natural properties such as "pleasant" or "desirable". Moore's naturalistic fallacy is closely related to the is–ought problem, which comes from David Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature (1738–40).  However, unlike Hume's view of the is–ought problem, Moore (and other proponents of ethical non-naturalism) did not consider the naturalistic fallacy to be at odds with moral realism. 

Neapolitan ice cream<====>21828<====>Neapolitan ice cream Neapolitan ice cream, sometimes known as harlequin ice cream,    is a flavor made up of three separate blocks of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry ice cream arranged side by side in the same container (typically with no packaging in between).  Some brands intermix the flavors more, though the separate flavors are still clearly visible. Neapolitan ice cream was named in the late 19th century as a reflection of its presumed origins in the cuisine of the Italian city of Naples, and the many Neapolitan immigrants who brought their expertise in frozen desserts with them to the United States. 

Nature<====>21830<====>NatureNature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe.  "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general.  The study of nature is a large part of science.  Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena. The word nature is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".Natura is a Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord. 

New moon<====>21833<====>New moon  In astronomy, the  new moon is the first lunar phase, when the Moon and Sun have the same ecliptic longitude.At this phase, the lunar disk is not visible to the unaided eye, except when silhouetted during a solar eclipse.  Daylight outshines the earthlight that dimly illuminates the dark side of the new Moon.  The actual phase is usually a very thin crescent because the Moon rarely passes directly in front of the Sun, except in a solar eclipse.  On July 8, 2013, French astrophotographer Thierry Legault successfully photographed the new Moon, although the crescent itself was invisible to the unaided eye. 

B-spline<====>21834<====>B-spline In the mathematical subfield of numerical analysis, a B-spline, or basis spline, is a spline function that has minimal support with respect to a given degree, smoothness, and domain partition.  Any spline function of given degree can be expressed as a linear combination of B-splines of that degree.  Cardinal B-splines have knots that are equidistant from each other.  B-splines can be used for curve-fitting and numerical differentiation of experimental data. In computer-aided design and computer graphics, spline functions are constructed as linear combinations of B-splines with a set of control points. IntroductionThe term "B-spline" was coined by Isaac Jacob Schoenberg  and is short for basis spline. 

North Pole<====>21836<====>North PoleThe North Pole, also known as the Geographic North Pole or Terrestrial North Pole, is (subject to the caveats explained below) defined as the point in the Northern Hemisphere where the Earth's axis of rotation meets its surface. The North Pole is the northernmost point on the Earth, lying diametrically opposite the South Pole.  It defines geodetic latitude 90° North, as well as the direction of true north.  At the North Pole all directions point south; all lines of longitude converge there, so its longitude can be defined as any degree value. 

Nanometre<====>21837<====>Nanometre The nanometre (International spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures; SI symbol: nm) or nanometer (American spelling) is a unit of length in the metric system, equal to one billionth (short scale) of a metre (  m).  The name combines the SI prefix nano- (from the Ancient Greek  ,  , "dwarf") with the parent unit name metre (from Greek  ,  , "unit of measurement").   It can be written in scientific notation as  , in engineering notation as  , and is simply   metres.  One nanometre equals ten ångströms. 

National Transportation Safety Board<====>21840<====>National Transportation Safety Board   The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent U. S.  government investigative agency responsible for civil transportation accident investigation.  In this role, the NTSB investigates and reports on aviation accidents and incidents, certain types of highway crashes, ship and marine accidents, pipeline incidents, and railroad accidents.When requested, the NTSB will assist the military and foreign governments with accident investigation.   The NTSB is also in charge of investigating cases of hazardous materials releases that occur during transportation.   The agency is based in Washington, D. 

Nucleosome<====>21843<====>NucleosomeA nucleosome is a basic unit of DNA packaging in eukaryotes, consisting of a segment of DNA wound in sequence around eight  histone protein cores.This structure is often compared to thread wrapped around a spool.  Nucleosomes form the fundamental repeating units of eukaryotic chromatin,    which is used to pack the large eukaryotic genomes into the nucleus while still ensuring appropriate access to it (in mammalian cells approximately 2 m of linear DNA have to be packed into a nucleus of roughly 10 µm diameter).  Nucleosomes are folded through a series of successively higher order structures  to eventually form a chromosome; this both compacts DNA and creates an added layer of regulatory control, which ensures correct gene expression. 

Neurosurgery<====>21848<====>Neurosurgery  Neurosurgery, or neurological surgery is the medical specialty concerned with the prevention, diagnosis, surgical treatment, and rehabilitation of disorders which affect any portion of the nervous system including the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, and extra-cranial cerebrovascular system.    link}}  Neurosurgery is often colloquially referred to as "brain surgery". Education and contextIn different countries, there are different requirements for an individual to legally practice neurosurgery, and there are varying methods through which they must be educated.  In most countries, neurosurgeon training requires a minimum period of seven years after graduating from medical school.  United StatesIn the United States, a neurosurgeon must generally complete four years of undergraduate education, four years of medical school, and seven years of residency (PGY-1-7). 

Nintendo 64<====>21849<====>Nintendo 64   The  , stylized as the NINTENDO 64  and abbreviated to N64, is Nintendo's third home video game console for the international market.  Named for its 64-bit central processing unit, it was released in June 1996 in Japan, September 1996 in North America and Brazil, March 1997 in Europe and Australia, September 1997 in France.  It was the last major home console to use the cartridge as its primary storage format until Nintendo's seventh console, the Nintendo Switch, released in 2017.   Though succeeded by Nintendo's MiniDVD-based GameCube in September 2001, the Nintendo 64 was sold until the system was retired in late 2003. 

GNU nano<====>21850<====>GNU nano GNU nano is a text editor for Unix-like computing systems or operating environments using a command line interface.  It emulates the  Pico text editor, part of the Pine email client, and also provides additional functionality.  Unlike Pico, nano is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).  Released as free software by Chris Allegretta in 1999, nano became part of the GNU Project in 2001.  HistoryGNU nano was first created in 1999 with the name TIP (TIP Isn't Pico), by Chris Allegretta.  His motivation was to create a free software replacement for Pico, which was not distributed under a free software license. 

Nieuwe Waterweg<====>21851<====>Nieuwe Waterweg  The Nieuwe Waterweg ("New Waterway") is a ship canal in the Netherlands from het Scheur (a branch of the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta) west of the town of Maassluis to the North Sea at Hook of Holland: the Maasmond, where the Nieuwe Waterweg connects to the Maasgeul.  It is the artificial mouth of the river Rhine. The Nieuwe Waterweg, which opened in 1872 and has a length of approximately  , was constructed to keep the city and port of Rotterdam accessible to seafaring vessels as the natural Meuse-Rhine branches silted up.  Website Rijkswaterstaat about Nieuwe Waterweg, visited: 24 April, 2012  The Waterway is a busy shipping route since it is the primary access to one of the busiest ports in the world, the Port of Rotterdam. 

Neijia<====>21853<====>Neijia   Neijia is a term in Chinese martial arts, grouping those styles that practice neijing, usually translated as internal martial arts, occupied with spiritual, mental or qi-related aspects, as opposed to an "external" approach focused on physiological aspects.  The distinction dates to the 17th century, but its modern application is due to publications by Sun Lutang, dating to the period of 1915 to 1928.   Neijing is developed by using neigong, or "internal exercises," as opposed to "external exercises" (wàigōng   ),Wudangquan is a more specific grouping of internal martial arts named for their association with the Taoist monasteries of the Wudang Mountains, Hubei in Chinese popular legend. 

Navigation<====>21854<====>Navigation Navigation is a field of study that focuses on the process of monitoring and controlling the movement of a craft or vehicle from one place to another.  Bowditch, 2003:799.   The field of navigation includes four general categories: land navigation, marine navigation, aeronautic navigation, and space navigation.  It is also the term of art used for the specialized knowledge used by navigators to perform navigation tasks.  All navigational techniques involve locating the navigator's position compared to known locations or patterns. Navigation, in a broader sense, can refer to any skill or study that involves the determination of position and direction. 

Non-fiction<====>21857<====>Non-fiction Non-fiction or nonfiction is content (sometimes, in the form of a story) whose creator, in good faith, assumes responsibility for the truth or accuracy of the events, people, or information presented.In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as fiction.    Nonfiction, which may be presented either objectively or subjectively, is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, prose writing),  the other traditional division being fiction, which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary. 

Cryptonomicon<====>21861<====>Cryptonomicon  Cryptonomicon is a 1999 novel by American author Neal Stephenson, set in two different time periods.  One group of characters are World War II-era Allied codebreakers and tactical-deception operatives affiliated with the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park (UK), and disillusioned Axis military and intelligence figures.  The second narrative is set in the late 1990s, with characters that are (in part) descendants of those of the earlier time period, who employ cryptologic, telecom, and computer technology to build an underground data haven in the fictional Sultanate of Kinakuta.  Their goal is to facilitate anonymous Internet banking using electronic money and (later) digital gold currency, with a long-term objective to distribute Holocaust Education and Avoidance Pod (HEAP) media for instructing genocide-target populations on defensive warfare. 

In the Beginning... Was the Command Line<====>21862<====>In the Beginning. . .  Was the Command Line In the Beginning. . .  Was the Command Line is an essay by Neal Stephenson which was originally published online in 1999 and later made available in book form (November 1999,  ).  The essay is a commentary on why the proprietary operating systems business is unlikely to remain profitable in the future because of competition from free software.  It also analyzes the corporate/collective culture of the Microsoft, Apple, and free software communities. ThemesStephenson explores the GUI as a metaphor in terms of the increasing interposition of abstractions between humans and the actual workings of devices (in a similar manner to Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance)  and explains the beauty hackers feel in good-quality tools. 

Netscape Navigator<====>21863<====>Netscape Navigator    Netscape Navigator is a discontinued proprietary web browser, and the original browser of the Netscape line, from versions 1 to 4. 08, and 9. x.  It was the flagship product of the Netscape Communications Corp and was the dominant web browser in terms of usage share in the 1990s, but by 2002 its usage had almost disappeared.   This was primarily due to the increased usage of Microsoft's Internet Explorer web browser software, and partly because the Netscape Corporation (later purchased by AOL) did not sustain Netscape Navigator's technical innovation after the late 1990s. 

Neurotransmitter<====>21865<====>Neurotransmitter   Neurotransmitters, also known as chemical messengers, are endogenous chemicals that enable neurotransmission.  They transmit signals across a chemical synapse, such as a neuromuscular junction, from one neuron (nerve cell) to another "target" neuron, muscle cell, or gland cell.   Neurotransmitters are released from synaptic vesicles in synapses into the synaptic cleft, where they are received by neurotransmitter receptors on the target cells.  Many neurotransmitters are synthesized from simple and plentiful precursors such as amino acids, which are readily available from the diet and only require a small number of biosynthetic steps for conversion.  Neurotransmitters play a major role in shaping everyday life and functions. 

Neutronium<====>21868<====>Neutronium Neutronium (sometimes shortened to neutrium,  also referred to as neutrite ) is a hypothetical substance composed purely of neutrons.  The word was coined by scientist Andreas von Antropoff in 1926 (before the discovery of the neutron) for the conjectured "element of atomic number zero" that he placed at the head of the periodic table.   However, the meaning of the term has changed over time, and from the last half of the 20th century onward it has been also used to refer to extremely dense substances resembling the neutron-degenerate matter theorized to exist in the cores of neutron stars; hereinafter "degenerate neutronium" will refer to this. 

Neutron star<====>21869<====>Neutron star A neutron star is the collapsed core of a large star which before collapse had a total of between 10 and 29 solar masses.  Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars known to exist.   Though neutron stars typically have a radius on the order of  , they can have masses of about twice that of the Sun.  They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past the white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei.

Nuremberg Code<====>21881<====>Nuremberg Code The Nuremberg Code ( ) is a set of research ethics principles for human experimentation set as a result of the subsequent Nuremberg trials at the end of the Second World War. BackgroundThe origin of the Nuremberg Code began in pre-World War II German politics, particularly during the 1930s and 1940s.  The pre-war German Medical Association was considered to be a progressive yet democratic association with great concerns for public health, one example being the legislation of compulsory health insurance for German workers.  However, starting in the mid-1920s, German physicians, usually proponents of racial hygiene, were accused by the public and the medical society of unethical medical practices. 

Nim<====>21885<====>Nim    Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps.  On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap.  The goal of the game is to avoid being the player who must remove the last object. Variants of Nim have been played since ancient times.   The game is said to have originated in China—it closely resembles the Chinese game of 捡石子 jiǎn-shízi, or "picking stones" —but the origin is uncertain; the earliest European references to Nim are from the beginning of the 16th century.

National Institute of Standards and Technology<====>21888<====>National Institute of Standards and Technology   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a measurement standards laboratory, and a non-regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce.  Its mission is to promote innovation and industrial competitiveness. NIST's activities are organized into laboratory programs that include Nanoscale Science and Technology, Engineering, Information Technology, Neutron Research, Material Measurement, and Physical Measurement. HistoryBackgroundThe Articles of Confederation, ratified by the colonies in 1781, contained the clause, "The United States in Congress assembled shall also have the sole and exclusive right and power of regulating the alloy and value of coin struck by their own authority, or by that of the respective states—fixing the standards of weights and measures throughout the United States". 

NATO reporting name<====>21891<====>NATO reporting name NATO reporting names are code names for military equipment of Russia, China, and, historically, the former Eastern Bloc (Soviet Union and other nations of the Warsaw Pact).  They provide unambiguous and easily understood English words in a uniform manner in place of the original designations, which either may have been unknown to the Western world at the time or easily confused codes.For example, the Russian bomber jet Tupolev Tu-160 is simply called Blackjack. NATO maintains lists of the names.  The assignment of the names for the Russian and Chinese aircraft was once managed by the five-nation Air Standardization Coordinating Committee (ASCC) (now called the Air and Space Interoperability Council, or ASIC, which includes representatives of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States), but that is no longer the case.

The Cyrillic "X" (read "Kh") in the designation of Soviet ASMs is in fact a Latin "X" ("ecs")   for Xperimental, as used by the design bureau.  With passing time, however, this was ignored and used in Soviet/Russian as well as foreign literature as the Cyrillic Kh.

Seven Laws of Noah<====>21907<====>Seven Laws of NoahThe Seven Laws of Noah (  Sheva Mitzvot B'nei Noach), also referred to as the Noahide Laws or the Noachide Laws (from the English transliteration of the Hebrew pronunciation of "Noah"), are a set of imperatives which, according to the Talmud, were given by God   as a binding set of laws for the "children of Noah" – that is, all of humanity.   Accordingly, any non-Jew who adheres to these laws because they were given by Moses  is regarded as a righteous gentile, and is assured of a place in the world to come (  Olam Haba), the final reward of the righteous. 

Naturism<====>21911<====>Naturism  Naturism, or nudism, is a cultural and political movement practising, advocating, and defending personal and social nudity, most but not all of which takes place on private property.  The term may also refer to a lifestyle based on personal, family, or social nudism.   Naturism may take a number of forms.  It may be practiced individually, within a family, socially, or in public.  Additionally, there is also militant naturism, including campaigning, and extreme naturism is sometimes considered a separate category.  Definition and lexicologyThe XIV Congress of the International Naturist Federation (Agde, France, 1974) defined naturism as:a way of life in harmony with nature characterised by the practice of communal nudity with the intention of encouraging self-respect, respect for others and for the environment.

Normal subgroup<====>21918<====>Normal subgroup   In abstract algebra, a normal subgroup is a subgroup which is invariant under conjugation by members of the group of which it is a part.  In  other  words, a subgroup   of a group   is normal in   if and only if   for all   in  ; i. e. , the sets of left and right cosets coincide.   Normal subgroups (and only normal subgroups) can be used to construct quotient groups from a given group. Évariste Galois was the first to realize the importance of the existence of normal subgroups. 

Munkar and Nakir<====>21919<====>Munkar and Nakir   Munkar and Nakir ( ) (English translation: "The Denied and The Denier") in Islamic eschatology, are angels who test the faith of the dead in their graves.  DescriptionThese angels are described as having solid black eyes, having a shoulder span measured in miles, and carrying hammers "so large, that if all of mankind tried at once to move them a single inch, they would fail".  When they speak, tongues of fire come from their mouths.  If one answers their questions incorrectly, one is beaten every day, other than Friday, until Allah gives permission for the beating to stop. 

Napalm<====>21920<====>Napalm Napalm is a flammable liquid that was used in warfare.  It is a mixture of a gelling agent and either gasoline (petrol) or a similar fuel.  It was initially used as an incendiary device against buildings and later primarily as an anti-personnel weapon, as it sticks to skin and causes severe burns when on fire.  Napalm was developed in 1942 in a secret laboratory at Harvard University, by a team led by chemist Louis Fieser.Its first recorded use was in the European theatre of war during World War II.  It was used extensively by the US in incendiary attacks on Japanese cities in World War II as well as during the Korean War and Vietnam War. 

Northern Crusades<====>21921<====>Northern Crusades The Northern Crusades    or Baltic Crusades  were religious wars undertaken by Catholic Christian military orders and kingdoms, primarily against the pagan Baltic, Finnic and West Slavic peoples around the southern and eastern shores of the Baltic Sea, and to a lesser extent also against Orthodox Christian Slavs (East Slavs).  The crusades took place mostly in the 12th and 13th centuries and resulted in the subjugation and forced baptism of indigenous peoples.  The most notable campaigns were the Livonian and Prussian crusades.  Some of these wars were called crusades during the Middle Ages, but others, including most of the Swedish ones, were first dubbed crusades by 19th-century romantic nationalist historians. 

Neoteny<====>21922<====>Neoteny Neoteny (  or  ,  (also called juvenilization) Montagu, A.  (1989).  Growing Young.  Bergin & Garvey: CT.   is the delaying or slowing of the physiological (or somatic) development of an organism, typically an animal.  Neoteny is found in modern humans.   In progenesis (also called paedogenesis), sexual development is accelerated.   Both neoteny and progenesis result in paedomorphism (or paedomorphosis), a type of heterochrony.Some authors define paedomorphism as the retention of larval traits, as seen in salamanders.   Schell, S. 

National Rail<====>21923<====>National RailNational Rail (NR) in the United Kingdom is the trading name licensed for use by the Rail Delivery Group, an unincorporated association whose membership consists of the passenger train operating companies (TOCs) of the island of Great Britain as well as the Isle of Wight that run the passenger services previously provided by the British Railways Board, from 1965 using the brand name British Rail.  Northern Ireland, which is linked to the Republic of Ireland, has a different system.  National Rail generally does not include services that do not have a BR history; this distinction is important because National Rail services share a ticketing structure and inter-availability that do not necessarily extend to other services. 

Naked singularity<====>21926<====>Naked singularity In general relativity, a naked singularity is a gravitational singularity without an event horizon.  In a black hole, the singularity is completely enclosed by a boundary known as the event horizon, inside which the gravitational force of the singularity is so strong that light cannot escape.  Hence, objects inside the event horizon—including the singularity itself—cannot be directly observed.  A naked singularity, by contrast, is observable from the outside. The theoretical existence of naked singularities is important because their existence would mean that it would be possible to observe the collapse of an object to infinite density. 

National Party of Australia<====>21927<====>National Party of Australia The National Party of Australia (also known as The Nationals or simply, The Nats) is an Australian political party.  Traditionally representing graziers, farmers, and rural voters generally, it began as the Australian Country Party in 1920 at a federal level.  It would later briefly adopt the name National Country Party in 1975, before adopting its current name in 1982. Federally, and in New South Wales, and to an extent in Victoria and historically in Western Australia, it has, in government, been the minor party in a centre-right Coalition with the Liberal Party of Australia, and its leader has usually served as Deputy Prime Minister. 

Northern blot<====>21930<====>Northern blotThe northern blot, or RNA blot, Gilbert, S.  F.  (2000) Developmental Biology, 6th Ed.  Sunderland MA, Sinauer Associates.   is a technique used in molecular biology research to study gene expression by detection of RNA (or isolated mRNA) in a sample.   Kevil, C.  G. , Walsh, L. , Laroux, F.  S. , Kalogeris, T. , Grisham, M.  B. , Alexander, J.  S.  (1997) An Improved, Rapid Northern Protocol.   Biochem.  and Biophys.  Research Comm.  238:277–279.  With northern blotting it is possible to observe cellular control over structure and function by determining the particular gene expression rates during differentiation and morphogenesis, as well as in abnormal or diseased conditions. 

Narrow-gauge railway<====>21932<====>Narrow-gauge railway  A narrow-gauge railway (narrow-gauge railroad in the US) is a railway with a track gauge narrower than the standard  .  Most narrow-gauge railways are between   and  . Since narrow-gauge railways are usually built with smaller radius curves, smaller structure gauges and lighter rails, they can be less-costly to build, equip and operate than standard- or broad-gauge railways (particularly in mountainous or difficult terrain).  Lower-cost narrow-gauge railways are often built to serve industries and communities where the traffic potential would not justify the cost of a standard- or broad-gauge line. Narrow-gauge railways have specialized use in mines and other environments, where a small structure gauge necessitates a small loading gauge. 

Neutron activation analysis<====>21933<====>Neutron activation analysis  Neutron activation analysis (NAA) is a nuclear process used for determining the concentrations of elements in a vast amount of materials.  NAA allows discrete sampling of elements as it disregards the chemical form of a sample, and focuses solely on its nucleus.  The method is based on neutron activation and therefore requires a source of neutrons.  The sample is bombarded with neutrons, causing the elements to form radioactive isotopes.  The radioactive emissions and radioactive decay paths for each element are well known.  Using this information, it is possible to study spectra of the emissions of the radioactive sample, and determine the concentrations of the elements within it. 

Non-deterministic Turing machine<====>21935<====>Non-deterministic Turing machine In theoretical computer science, a Turing machine is a theoretical machine that is used in thought experiments to examine the abilities and limitations of computers. BackgroundIn essence, a Turing machine is imagined to be a simple computer that reads and writes symbols one at a time on an endless tape by strictly following a set of rules.  It determines what action it should perform next according to its internal state and what symbol it currently sees.  An example of one of a Turing Machine's rules might thus be: "If you are in state 2 and you see an 'A', change it to 'B' and move left. 

Nitrogen narcosis<====>21937<====>Nitrogen narcosis   Narcosis while diving (also known as nitrogen narcosis, inert gas narcosis, raptures of the deep, Martini effect) is a reversible alteration in consciousness that occurs while diving at depth.  It is caused by the anesthetic effect of certain gases at high pressure.  The Greek word ναρκωσις (narcosis) is derived from narke, "temporary decline or loss of senses and movement, numbness", a term used by Homer and Hippocrates.   Narcosis produces a state similar to drunkenness (alcohol intoxication), or nitrous oxide inhalation.  It can occur during shallow dives, but does not usually become noticeable at depths less than   . 

Neoproterozoic<====>21938<====>Neoproterozoic The Neoproterozoic Era is the unit of geologic time from  .    It is the last era of the Precambrian Supereon and the Proterozoic Eon; it is subdivided into the Tonian, Cryogenian, and Ediacaran Periods.  It is preceded by the Mesoproterozoic era and succeeded by the Paleozoic era. The most severe glaciation known in the geologic record occurred during the Cryogenian, when ice sheets reached the equator and formed a possible "Snowball Earth". The earliest fossils of multicellular life are found in the Ediacaran, including the earliest animals. According to Rino and co-workers, the sum of the continental crust formed in the Pan-African orogeny and the Grenville orogeny makes the Neoproterozoic the period of Earth's history that has produced most continental crust. 

National Security Agency<====>21939<====>National Security Agency    The National Security Agency (NSA) is a national-level intelligence agency of the United States Department of Defense, under the authority of the Director of National Intelligence.  The NSA is responsible for global monitoring, collection, and processing of information and data for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes, specializing in a discipline known as signals intelligence (SIGINT).  The NSA is also tasked with the protection of U. S.  communications networks and information systems.    The NSA relies on a variety of measures to accomplish its mission, the majority of which are clandestine. 

Nervous system<====>21944<====>Nervous system    The nervous system is the part of an animal that coordinates its actions by transmitting signals to and from different parts of its body.  The nervous system detects enviromental changes that impact the body, then works in tandem with the endocrine system to respond to such events .  Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago.  In vertebrates it consists of two main parts, the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).  The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord.  The PNS consists mainly of nerves, which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons, that connect the CNS to every other part of the body. 

Nutcracker<====>21946<====>Nutcracker A nutcracker is a tool designed to open nuts by cracking their shells.  There are many designs, including levers, screws, and ratchets.  A well-known type portrays a person whose mouth forms the jaws of the nutcracker, though many of these are meant for decorative use. FunctionalNuts were historically opened using a hammer and anvil, often made of stone.   Some nuts such as walnuts can also be opened by hand, by holding the nut in the palm of the hand and applying pressure with the other palm or thumb, or using another nut.  Manufacturers produce modern functional nutcrackers usually somewhat resembling pliers, but with the pivot point at the end beyond the nut, rather than in the middle. 

Nicolai Abildgaard<====>21949<====>Nicolai Abildgaard  Nicolai Abraham Abildgaard (September 11, 1743 – June 4, 1809)  was a Danish neoclassical and royal history painter, sculptor, architect, and professor of painting, mythology, and anatomy at the New Royal Danish Academy of Art in Copenhagen, Denmark.  Many of his works were in the royal Christiansborg Palace (some destroyed by fire 1794), Fredensborg Palace, and Levetzau Palace at Amalienborg. Abildgaard had studied at the Academy from 1764 to 1767, then worked there as an apprentice, and moved to Rome in 1772–1777, where he studied sculpture, architecture, decoration, frescoes (at Palazzo Farnese) and murals.  He returned to the Academy in Copenhagen, promoted to professor in 1778, and elected as Academy Director during 1789–1791 and 1801–1809. 

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa<====>21950<====>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (abbreviated as KP;   ;   )  is one of the four administrative provinces of Pakistan, located in the northwestern region of the country along the international border with Afghanistan.  It was previously known as the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) until 2010, and is known colloquially by various other names.  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the third-largest province of Pakistan by the size of both population and economy though it is geographically the smallest of four.It comprises 10. 5% of Pakistan's economy, and is home to 11. 

Naiad (moon)<====>21952<====>Naiad (moon) Naiad (    or    ;  ), also known as Neptune III, is the innermost satellite of Neptune, named after the Naiads of Greek legend.  HistoryNaiad was discovered sometime before mid-September 1989 from the images taken by the Voyager 2 probe.  The last moon to be discovered during the flyby, it was designated S/1989 N 6.   The discovery was announced on September 29, 1989, in the IAU Circular No.  4867, but the text only talks of "25 frames taken over 11 days", giving a discovery date of sometime before September 18. 

Nilo-Saharan languages<====>21953<====>Nilo-Saharan languages The Nilo-Saharan languages are a proposed family of African languages spoken by some 50–60 million people, mainly in the upper parts of the Chari and Nile rivers, including historic Nubia, north of where the two tributaries of the Nile meet.  The languages extend through 17 nations in the northern half of Africa: from Algeria to Benin in the west; from Libya to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the centre; and from Egypt to Tanzania in the east. As indicated by its hyphenated name, Nilo-Saharan is a family of the African interior, including the greater Nile basin and the central Sahara desert. 

Nuclear pore<====>21957<====>Nuclear pore Nuclear pores are large protein complexes that cross the nuclear envelope, which is the double membrane surrounding the eukaryotic cell nucleus.  There are about an average of 2000 nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), in the nuclear envelope of a vertebrate cell, but it varies depending on cell type and the stage in the life cycle.The proteins that make up the nuclear pore complex are known as nucleoporins.  About half of the nucleoporins typically contain solenoid protein domains—either an alpha solenoid or a beta-propeller fold, or in some cases both as separate structural domains. 

Nucleolus<====>21958<====>Nucleolus  The nucleolus (  or  , plural nucleoli   or  ) is the largest structure in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells.It is best known as the site of ribosome biogenesis.  Nucleoli also participate in the formation of signal recognition particles and play a role in the cell's response to stress.   Nucleoli are made of proteins, DNA and RNA and form around specific chromosomal regions called nucleolar organizing regions.   Malfunction of nucleoli can be the cause of several human conditions called "nucleolopathies"    and the nucleolus is being investigated as a target for cancer chemotherapy. 

Nucleon<====>21961<====>Nucleon  In chemistry and physics, a nucleon is either a proton or a neutron, considered in its role as a component of an atomic nucleus.  The number of nucleons in a nucleus defines an isotope's mass number (nucleon number). Until the 1960s, nucleons were thought to be elementary particles, not made up of smaller parts.  Now they are known to be composite particles, made of three quarks bound together by the so-called strong interaction.  The interaction between two or more nucleons is called internucleon interactions or nuclear force, which is also ultimately caused by the strong interaction. 

Nicolas Chauvin<====>21966<====>Nicolas ChauvinNicolas Chauvin ( ) is a legendary, possibly apocryphal French soldier and patriot who is supposed to have served in the First Army of the French Republic and subsequently in La Grande Armée of Napoleon.  His name is the eponym  of chauvinism, originally a term for excessive nationalistic fervor, but later used to refer to any form of bigotry or bias (e. g. , male chauvinism). According to the stories that developed about him, Chauvin was born in Rochefort, around 1780.   He enlisted at age 18, and served honorably and well.  He is said to have been wounded 17 times in his nation's service, resulting in his severe disfigurement and maiming. 

Nicotinamide<====>21968<====>Nicotinamide  Nicotinamide (NAA), also known as niacinamide, is a vitamin found in food, used as a dietary supplement, and used as a medication.  As a supplement, it is used by mouth to prevent and treat pellagra (niacin deficiency).   While nicotinic acid (niacin) may be used for this purpose, nicotinamide has the benefit of not causing skin flushing.As a cream, it is used to treat acne.   Side effects are minimal. At high doses liver problems may occur.   Normal amounts are safe for use during pregnancy. 

Virtual Boy<====>21970<====>Virtual Boy  The Virtual Boy  is a 32-bit table-top video game console developed and manufactured by Nintendo.  Released in 1995, it was marketed as the first console capable of displaying stereoscopic 3D graphics.  The player uses the console in a manner similar to a head-mounted display, placing their head against the eyepiece to see a red monochrome display.  The games use a parallax effect to create the illusion of depth.  Sales failed to meet targets, and by early 1996, Nintendo ceased distribution and game development, only ever releasing 22 games for the system.  Development of the Virtual Boy lasted four years, and began originally under the project name of VR32. 

NSAP address<====>21974<====>NSAP address A Network Service Access Point address (NSAP address), defined in ISO/IEC 8348, is an identifying label for a Service Access Point (SAP) used in OSI networking. These are roughly comparable to IP addresses used in the Internet Protocol; they can specify a piece of equipment connected to an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network.  A specific stream, analogous to a TCP/IP port or socket, is specified by using a Transport Service Access Point (TSAP).  ATM can also use a Presentation (PSAP) and Session (SSAP) Access Point, but these may also be unspecified; this is up to the application. 

American submarine NR-1<====>21976<====>American submarine NR-1  NR-1}   Deep Submergence Vessel NR-1 was a unique United States Navy (USN) nuclear-powered ocean engineering and research submarine, built by the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics at Groton, Connecticut.  NR-1 was launched on 25 January 1969, completed initial sea trials 19 August 1969, and was home-ported at Naval Submarine Base New London.  NR-1 was the smallest nuclear submarine ever put into operation.  The vessel was casually known as "Nerwin" and was never officially named or commissioned.  The U. S.  Navy is allocated a specific number of warships by the U. 

Neo Geo Pocket<====>21977<====>Neo Geo Pocket   The Neo Geo Pocket is a monochrome handheld game console released by SNK.  It was the company's first handheld system and is part of the Neo Geo family.  It debuted in Japan in late 1998 but never saw a western release, being exclusive to Japan and smaller Asian markets such as Hong Kong. The Neo Geo Pocket is considered to be an unsuccessful console.  Lower than expected sales resulted in its discontinuation in 1999,    and was immediately succeeded by the Neo Geo Pocket Color, a full color device allowing the system to compete more easily with the dominant Game Boy Color handheld, and which also saw a western release. 

Neil Kinnock<====>21978<====>Neil Kinnock   Neil Gordon Kinnock, Baron Kinnock, PC (born 28 March 1942) is a British Labour Party politician.  He served as a Member of Parliament from 1970 until 1995, first for Bedwellty and then for Islwyn.  He was the Leader of the Labour Party and Leader of the Opposition from 1983 until 1992. Kinnock led the Labour Party to a surprise fourth consecutive defeat at the 1992 general election, despite the party being ahead in most opinion polls; which had predicted either a narrow Labour victory or a hung parliament.  Afterwards, he resigned as Leader of the Labour Party after nine years and from the House of Commons in 1995. 

Netscape<====>21979<====>Netscape  Netscape is a brand name associated with the development of the Netscape web browser.  It is now owned by Oath, Inc. , a subsidiary of Verizon.    The brand belonged to the Netscape Communications Corporation (formerly Mosaic Communications Corporation), an independent American computer services company, whose headquarters were in Mountain View, California, and later Dulles, Virginia.    The browser was once dominant but lost to Internet Explorer and other competitors after the so-called first browser war, its market share falling from more than 90 percent in the mid-1990s  to less than 1 percent in 2006. 

Newfoundland and Labrador<====>21980<====>Newfoundland and Labrador    Newfoundland and Labrador ( ,  ;  ; Newfoundland Irish: Talamh an Éisc agus Labradar) is the most easterly province of Canada.  Situated in the country's Atlantic region, it comprises the island of Newfoundland and mainland Labrador to the northwest, with a combined area of  .  In 2013, the province's population was estimated at 526,702.About 92% of the province's population lives on the island of Newfoundland (and its neighbouring smaller islands), of whom more than half live on the Avalon Peninsula.  The province is Canada's most linguistically homogeneous, with 97. 

New Oxford American Dictionary<====>21981<====>New Oxford American Dictionary The New Oxford American Dictionary (NOAD) is a single-volume dictionary of American English compiled by American editors at the Oxford University Press. NOAD is based upon the New Oxford Dictionary of English (NODE), published in the United Kingdom in 1998, although with substantial editing, additional entries, and the inclusion of illustrations.   It is based on a corpus linguistics analysis of Oxford's 200 million word database of contemporary American English. NOAD includes a diacritical respelling scheme to convey pronunciations, as opposed to the Gimson phonemic IPA system that is used in NODE. EditionsFirstPublished in September 2001, the first edition was edited by Elizabeth J. 

New Latin<====>21983<====>New Latin   New Latin (also called Neo-Latin  or Modern Latin)    was a revival in the use of Latin in original, scholarly, and scientific works between c.  1375 and c.  1900.  Modern scholarly and technical nomenclature, such as in zoological and botanical taxonomy and international scientific vocabulary, draws extensively from New Latin vocabulary.  In such use, New Latin is often viewed as still existing and subject to new word formation.  As a language for full expression in prose or poetry, however, it is often distinguished from Contemporary Latin as a predecessor. 

Naive Set Theory (book)<====>21986<====>Naive Set Theory (book) See also Naive set theory for the mathematical topic. Naive Set Theory is a mathematics textbook by Paul Halmos providing an undergraduate introduction to set theory.   Originally published by Van Nostrand in 1960,  it was reprinted in the Springer-Verlag Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics series in 1974.  While the title states that it is naive, which is usually taken to mean without axioms, the book does introduce all the axioms of ZFC set theory (except the Axiom of Foundation), and gives correct and rigorous definitions for basic objects.

Nitrogen fixation<====>21989<====>Nitrogen fixationNitrogen fixation is a process by which nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere is converted into ammonia (NH 3 ) or other molecules available to living organisms. Atmospheric nitrogen or molecular dinitrogen (N 2 ) is relatively inert: it does not easily react with other chemicals to form new compounds.   The fixation process frees nitrogen atoms from their triply bonded diatomic form, N≡N, to be used in other ways. Nitrogen fixation is essential for some forms of life because inorganic nitrogen compounds are required for the biosynthesis of the basic building blocks of plants, animals and other life forms, e. 

Navigation research<====>21994<====>Navigation researchWhereas originally the term Navigation applies to the process of directing a ship to a destination, Navigation research deals with fundamental aspects of navigation in general. It can be defined as "The process of determining and maintaining a course or trajectory to a goal location" (Franz, Mallot, 2000).It concerns basically all moving agents, biological or artificial, autonomous or remote-controlled.Franz and Mallot proposed a navigation hierarchy in Robotics and Autonomous Systems 30 (2006):    Behavioural prerequisite  Navigation competence Local navigation Search  Goal recognition  Finding the goal without active goal orientation Direction-following  Align course with local direction  Finding the goal from one direction Aiming  Keep goal in front  Finding a salient goal from a catchment area Guidance  Attain spatial relation to the surrounding objects  Finding a goal defined by its relation to the surroundings Way-finding Recognition-triggered response  Association sensory pattern-action  Following fixed routes Topological navigation  Route integration, route planning  Flexible concatenation of route segments Survey navigation  Embedding into a common reference frame  Finding paths over novel terrain There are two basic methods for navigation:Egocentric navigation also known as Idiothetic navigationAllocentric navigation also known as Allothetic navigationHuman navigationIn human navigation people visualize different routes in their minds to plan how to get from one place to another. The things which they rely on to plan these routes vary from person to person and are the basis of the differing navigational strategies.  Some people use measures of distance and absolute directional terms (north, south, east, and west) in order to visualize the best pathway from point to point. The use of these more general, external cues as directions is considered part of an allocentric navigation strategy. Allocentric navigation is typically seen in males and is beneficial primarily in large and/or unfamiliar environments. Andreano & Cahill (2009)  This likely has some basis in evolution when males would have to navigate through large and unfamiliar environments while hunting. Geary (1998)  The use of allocentric strategies when navigating primarily activates the hippocampus and parahippocampus in the brain. This navigation strategy relies more on a mental, spatial map than visible cues, giving it an advantage in unknown areas but a flexibility to be used in smaller environments as well. The fact that it is mainly males that favor this strategy is likely related to the generalization that males are better navigators than females as it is better able to be applied in a greater variety of settings. Egocentric navigation relies on more local landmarks and personal directions (left/right) to navigate and visualize a pathway. This reliance on more local and well-known stimuli for finding their way makes it difficult to apply in new locations, but is instead most effective in smaller, familiar environments.  Evolutionarily, egocentric navigation likely comes from our ancestors who would forage for their food and need to be able to return to the same places daily to find edible plants. This foraging usually occurred in relatively nearby areas and was most commonly done by the females in hunter-gatherer societies.  Females, today, are typically better at knowing where various landmarks are and often rely on them when giving directions. Egocentric navigation causes high levels of activation in the right parietal lobe and prefrontal regions of the brain that are involved in visuospatial processing. Robotic navigation Outdoor robots can use GPS in a similar way to automotive navigation systems.Alternative systems can be used with floor plan instead of maps for indoor robots, combined with localization wireless hardware.See alsoElectric beaconVisual navigationNotes ReferencesAndreano, J.

Naguib Mahfouz<====>21995<====>Naguib Mahfouz  Naguib Mahfouz (   ,  ; December 11, 1911 – August 30, 2006) was an Egyptian writer who won the 1988 Nobel Prize for Literature.  He is regarded as one of the first contemporary writers of Arabic literature, along with Tawfiq el-Hakim, to explore themes of existentialism.   He published 34 novels, over 350 short stories, dozens of movie scripts, and five plays over a 70-year career.  Many of his works have been made into Egyptian and foreign films. Early life and educationMahfouz was born into a lower middle-class Muslim Egyptian family in Old Cairo in 1911. 

Nomenklatura<====>21999<====>NomenklaturaThe nomenklatura ( ;  ) were a category of people within the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries who held various key administrative positions in the bureaucracy, running all spheres of those countries' activity: government, industry, agriculture, education, etc. , whose positions were granted only with approval by the communist party of each country or region. Virtually all members of the nomenklatura were members of the Communist Party.Critics of Stalin, such as Milovan Đilas, critically defined them as a new class.Trotsky used the term caste rather than class, because he saw the Soviet Union as a degenerated workers' state, not a new class society. 

Neural Darwinism<====>22000<====>Neural Darwinism Neural Darwinism, a large scale theory of brain function by Gerald Edelman, was initially published in 1978, in a book called The Mindful Brain (MIT Press).  It was extended and published in the 1987 book Neural Darwinism – The Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. In 1972, Edelman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology (shared with Rodney Porter of Great Britain) for his work in immunology showing how the population of lymphocytes capable of binding to a foreign antigen is increased by differential clonal multiplication following antigen discovery.  Essentially, this proved that the human body is capable of creating complex adaptive systems as a result of local events with feedback. 

Neil Peart<====>22003<====>Neil Peart    Neil Ellwood Peart,   ( ; born September 12, 1952), is a Canadian-American musician and author, best known as the drummer and primary lyricist for the rock band Rush.   Peart has received numerous awards for his musical performances, including an induction into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 1983, making him the youngest person ever so honored.   He is known for his technical proficiency and stamina. Peart grew up in Port Dalhousie, Ontario (now part of St.  Catharines).  During adolescence, he floated between regional bands in pursuit of a career as a full-time drummer. 

North Atlantic Treaty<====>22007<====>North Atlantic Treaty  The North Atlantic Treaty, signed in Washington, D. C.  on 4 April 1949, is the treaty establishing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). BackgroundThe treaty was signed in Washington, D. C.  on 4 April 1949 by a committee which was chaired by US diplomat Theodore Achilles.  Earlier secret talks had been held at the Pentagon between 22 March and 1 April 1948, of which Achilles said: The talks lasted about two weeks and by the time they finished, it had been secretly agreed that there would be a treaty, and I had a draft of one in the bottom drawer of my safe. 

Nitronium ion<====>22009<====>Nitronium ion The nitronium ion,    , is a cation.  It is an onium ion because of its tetravalent nitrogen atom and +1 charge, similar in that regard to ammonium.  It is created by the removal of an electron from the paramagnetic nitrogen dioxide molecule, or the protonation of nitric acid (with removal of H 2 O). It is stable enough to exist in normal conditions, but it is generally reactive and used extensively as an electrophile in the nitration of other substances.  The ion is generated in situ for this purpose by mixing concentrated sulfuric acid and concentrated nitric acid according to the equilibrium:H 2 SO 4  + HNO 3  → HSO  + NO  + H 2 OStructureThe nitronium ion is isoelectronic with carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, and has the same linear structure and bond angle of 180°. 

Neo Geo (system)<====>22011<====>Neo Geo (system)  The  , stylised as NEO・GEO, also written as NEOGEO, is a cartridge-based arcade system board and fourth-generation home video game console released on April 26, 1990, by Japanese game company SNK Corporation.  It was the first system in SNK's Neo Geo family.  The Neo Geo was marketed as 24-bit; its CPU is technically a parallel processing 16/32-bit 68000-based system with an 8/16-bit Z80 coprocessor much like the Sega Genesis, while its GPU chipset has a 24-bit graphics data bus. The Neo Geo originally launched as the MVS (Multi Video System) coin-operated arcade machine. 

Neo Geo CD<====>22012<====>Neo Geo CDis the second home video game console of SNK Corporation's Neo Geo family, released in September 9, 1994, four years after its cartridge-based equivalent.  This is the same platform, converted to the cheaper CD format retailing at $49 to $79 per title, compared to the $300 cartridges.The system was originally priced at US$399,  or £399 in the UK.  The unit's 1X CD-ROM drive is slow, with very long loading times of up to 56 Mbit of data per load.    The system can also play Audio CDs. 

Neopets<====>22015<====>Neopets   Neopets (originally NeoPets) is a virtual pet website.  Users can own virtual pets ("Neopets"), and buy virtual items for them using one of two virtual currencies.  One currency, called Neopoints, can be earned within the site, and the other, Neocash, can either be purchased with real-world money, or won by chance by playing Qasalan Expellibox. The website was launched by Adam Powell and Donna Williams in late 1999.  Two years later, a consortium of investors led by Doug Dohring bought a controlling interest in the company and in June 2005, Viacom bought Neopets Inc. 

Nashville, Tennessee<====>22018<====>Nashville, Tennessee  Nashville ( ) is the capital and most populous city of the U. S.  state of Tennessee and the seat of Davidson County.It is located on the Cumberland River in the north central part of the state.  The city is a center for the music,    healthcare, publishing, private prison,  banking and transportation industries, and is home to numerous colleges and universities. Since 1963, Nashville has had a consolidated city-county government, which includes six smaller municipalities in a two-tier system.  The city is governed by a mayor, a vice-mayor, and a 40-member Metropolitan Council; 35 of the members are elected from single-member districts, while the other five are elected at-large. 

Novial<====>22024<====>Novial Novial [nov- ("new") + IAL, International Auxiliary Language] is a constructed international auxiliary language (IAL) for universal communication between speakers of different native languages.   It was devised by Otto Jespersen, a Danish linguist who had been involved in the Ido movement, and later in the development of Interlingua de IALA. Its vocabulary is based largely on the Germanic and Romance languages and its grammar is influenced by English. Novial was introduced in Jespersen's book An International Language in 1928.  Jespersen, Otto (1928).  An international language.  London: Allen & Unwin.  LC no 29000603.    It was updated in his dictionary Novial Lexike in 1930,  and further modifications were proposed in the 1930s, but the language became dormant with Jespersen's death in 1943. 

Musical note<====>22026<====>Musical noteIn music, a note is the pitch and duration of a sound, and also its representation in musical notation (♪, ♩).  A note can also represent a pitch class.  Notes are the building blocks of much written music: discretizations of musical phenomena that facilitate performance, comprehension, and analysis.  The term note can be used in both generic and specific senses: one might say either "the piece 'Happy Birthday to You' begins with two notes having the same pitch", or "the piece begins with two repetitions of the same note".  In the former case, one uses note to refer to a specific musical event; in the latter, one uses the term to refer to a class of events sharing the same pitch. 

Nephrology<====>22028<====>Nephrology Nephrology (from Greek nephros "kidney", combined with the suffix -logy, "the study of") is a specialty of medicine and pediatrics that concerns itself with the kidneys: the study of normal kidney function and kidney problems, the preservation of kidney health, and the treatment of kidney problems, from diet and medication to   renal replacement therapy (dialysis and kidney transplantation).  Systemic conditions that affect the kidneys (such as diabetes and autoimmune disease) and systemic problems that occur as a result of kidney problems (such as renal osteodystrophy and hypertension) are also studied in nephrology.  A physician who has undertaken additional training to become an expert in nephrology may call themselves a nephrologist or renal physician. 

Native Esperanto speakers<====>22031<====>Native Esperanto speakers Native Esperanto speakers (Esperanto: denaskuloj or denaskaj esperantistoj) are people who have acquired Esperanto as one of their native languages.   As of 1996, there were 350 or so attested cases of families with native Esperanto speakers.    Estimates from associations indicate that there are currently around 1,000 Esperanto-speaking families, involving perhaps 2,000 children.    In all known cases, speakers are natively bilingual, or multilingual, raised in both Esperanto and either the local national language or the native language of their parents.  In all but a handful of cases, it was the father who used Esperanto with the child. 

Nicaragua v. United States<====>22033<====>Nicaragua v.  United States The Republic of Nicaragua v.  The United States of America (1986) ICJ 1 is a public international law case decided by the International Court of Justice (ICJ).  The ICJ ruled in favor of Nicaragua and against the United States and awarded reparations to Nicaragua.  The ICJ held that the U. S.  had violated international law by supporting the Contras in their rebellion against the Nicaraguan government and by mining Nicaragua's harbors.  The United States refused to participate in the proceedings after the Court rejected its argument that the ICJ lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. 

Naturalistic planned language<====>22034<====>Naturalistic planned languageA naturalistic planned language is a constructed language specifically devised to reproduce the commonalities in morphology and vocabulary from a group of closely related languages, usually with the idea that such a language will be relatively easier to use passively -- in many cases, without prior study -- by speakers of one or more languages in the group. The term is most commonly used to apply to pan-Romance planned languages, though there have also been a few pan-Germanic, pan-Slavic and even pan-Celtic naturalistic planned languages. Since the creation of such a language often includes shared idiosyncrasies from the source languages, active use seems to be generally more difficult to learn than for schematic planned languages, though because of grammatical simplification considerably easier than for ethnic languages of the same type. 

No-cloning theorem<====>22035<====>No-cloning theorem In physics, the no-cloning theorem states that it is impossible to create an identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state.  This no-go theorem of quantum mechanics was articulated by Wootters and Zurek  and Dieks  in 1982, and has profound implications in quantum computing and related fields. The state of one system can be entangled with the state of another system.  For instance, one can use the controlled NOT gate and the Walsh–Hadamard gate to entangle two qubits.  This is not cloning.  No well-defined state can be attributed to a subsystem of an entangled state. 

Norman Hackerman<====>22036<====>Norman Hackerman  Norman Hackerman (March 2, 1912 – June 16, 2007) was an American chemist, internationally known as an expert in metal corrosion, and a former president of both the University of Texas at Austin (1967–1970) and Rice University (1970–1985). BiographyBorn in Baltimore, Maryland, he was the only son of Jacob Hackerman and Anna Raffel, immigrants from the Baltic regions of the Russian Empire that later became Estonia and Latvia, respectively.  Hackerman earned his bachelor's degree in 1932 and his doctor's degree in chemistry in 1935 from Johns Hopkins University.  He taught at Johns Hopkins, Loyola College in Baltimore and the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia, before working on the Manhattan Project in World War II. 

N ray<====>22037<====>N ray  N rays (or N-rays) were a hypothesized form of radiation, described by French physicist Prosper-René Blondlot in 1903, and initially confirmed by others, but subsequently found to be illusory. HistoryContextThe N ray affair occurred shortly after a series of major breakthroughs in experimental physics.  Victor Schumann discovered vacuum ultraviolet radiation in 1893, Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays in 1895, Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity in 1896 and in 1897 J.  J.  Thomson discovered electrons, showing that they were the constituents of cathode rays.This created an expectation within the scientific community that other forms of radiation might be discovered. 

Nikolay Kuznetsov (officer)<====>22039<====>Nikolay Kuznetsov (officer)  Nikolay Gerasimovich Kuznetsov ( ; July 24, 1904 – December 6, 1974) was a Soviet naval officer who achieved the rank of Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union and served as People's Commissar of the Navy during The Second World War.  The Russian aircraft carrier   is named in his honor. BiographyEarly years and advancementNikolay Gerasimovich Kuznetsov was born into a peasant family of Serbian  descent in the village of Medvedki near Veliky Ustyug, Vologda Governorate, Russian Empire (now in Kotlassky District of Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia). In 1919, Kuznetsov joined the Northern Dvina Naval Flotilla, after adding two years to his age in order to be eligible to serve. 

Nuon (DVD technology)<====>22042<====>Nuon (DVD technology)  Nuon is a technology developed by VM Labs that adds features to a DVD player.  In addition to viewing DVDs, one can play 3D video games and use enhanced DVD navigational tools such as zoom and smooth scanning of DVD playback.  One could also play CDs while the Nuon graphics processor generates synchronized graphics on the screen.  There were plans to provide Internet access capability in the next generation of Nuon-equipped DVD players. HistoryNuon originally started off as "Project X," and was featured in Electronic Gaming Monthly s 1999 Video Game Buyer's Guide. 

Cuisine of New England<====>22048<====>Cuisine of New England New England cuisine is an American cuisine which originated in the New England region of the United States, and traces its roots to English cuisine.  It is characterized by extensive use of seafood and dairy products, which results from its historical reliance on its seaports and fishing industry, as well as extensive dairy farming in inland regions.  Many of New England's earliest Puritan settlers were from eastern England, where baking foods was more common than frying, such as pies, beans, and turkey, as was the tradition elsewhere.

Neil Simon<====>22049<====>Neil Simon Marvin Neil Simon (born July 4, 1927) is an American playwright, screenwriter and author.  He has written more than thirty plays and nearly the same number of movie screenplays, mostly adaptations of his plays.  He has received more combined Oscar and Tony nominations than any other writer.  Simon grew up in New York during the Great Depression, with his parents' financial hardships affecting their marriage, giving him a mostly unhappy and unstable childhood.  He often took refuge in movie theaters where he enjoyed watching the early comedians like Charlie Chaplin.  After a few years in the Army Air Force Reserve, and after graduating from high school, he began writing comedy scripts for radio and some popular early television shows. 

North American Free Trade Agreement<====>22050<====>North American Free Trade AgreementThe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA; Spanish: Tratado de Libre Comercio de América del Norte, TLCAN; French: Accord de libre-échange nord-américain, ALÉNA) is an agreement signed by Canada, Mexico, and the United States, creating a trilateral trade bloc in North America.  The agreement came into force on January 1, 1994.   It superseded the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement between the U. S.  and Canada.  NAFTA has two supplements: the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC) and the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC). 

National Lampoon (magazine)<====>22051<====>National Lampoon (magazine)  National Lampoon was an American humor magazine which ran from 1970 to 1998.  The magazine started out as a spinoff from the Harvard Lampoon.  National Lampoon magazine reached its height of popularity and critical acclaim during the late 1970s, when it had a far-reaching effect on American humor and comedy.  The magazine spawned films, radio, live theatre, various sound recordings, and print products including books.  Many members of the creative staff from the magazine subsequently went on to contribute creatively to successful media of all types. During the magazine's most successful years, parody of every kind was a mainstay; surrealist content was also central to its appeal. 

Non-disclosure agreement<====>22052<====>Non-disclosure agreement A non-disclosure agreement (NDA), also known as a confidentiality agreement (CA), confidential disclosure agreement (CDA), proprietary information agreement (PIA) or secrecy agreement (SA), is a legal contract between at least two parties that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to or by third parties.  It is a contract through which the parties agree not to disclose information covered by the agreement.  An NDA creates a confidential relationship between the parties to protect any type of confidential and proprietary information or trade secrets. 

Network effect<====>22053<====>Network effectA network effect (also called network externality or demand-side economies of scale) is the positive effect described in economics and business that an additional user of a good or service has on the value of that product to others.   When a network effect is present, the value of a product or service increases according to the number of others using it.    The classic example is the telephone, where a greater number of users increases the value to each.  A positive externality is created when a telephone is purchased without its owner intending to create value for other users, but does so regardless. 

Nuclear fission<====>22054<====>Nuclear fission    In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, nuclear fission is either a nuclear reaction or a radioactive decay process in which the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts (lighter nuclei).  The fission process often produces free neutrons and gamma photons, and releases a very large amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay. Nuclear fission of heavy elements was discovered on December 17, 1938 by German Otto Hahn and his assistant Fritz Strassmann, and explained theoretically in January 1939 by Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Robert Frisch.  Frisch named the process by analogy with biological fission of living cells. 

Neil Gaiman<====>22055<====>Neil Gaiman    Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman Born as Neil Richard Gaiman, with "MacKinnon" added on the occasion of his marriage to Amanda Palmer.( ;  born Neil Richard Gaiman,  10 November 1960)  is an English author of short fiction, novels, comic books, graphic novels, audio theatre, and films.  His notable works include the comic book series The Sandman and novels Stardust, American Gods, Coraline, and The Graveyard Book.  He has won numerous awards, including the Hugo, Nebula, and Bram Stoker awards, as well as the Newbery and Carnegie medals. 

Nymph<====>22058<====>Nymph  A nymph ( , nýmphē  ) in Greek mythology and in Latin mythology is a minor female nature deity typically associated with a particular location or landform.  Different from other goddesses, nymphs are generally regarded as divine spirits who animate nature, and are usually depicted as beautiful, young nubile maidens who love to dance and sing; their amorous freedom sets them apart from the restricted and chaste wives and daughters of the Greek polis.  They are beloved by many and dwell in mountainous regions and forests by lakes and streams.  Although they would never die of old age nor illness, and could give birth to fully immortal children if mated to a god, they themselves were not necessarily immortal, and could be beholden to death in various forms. 

Natural law<====>22063<====>Natural law Natural law ( , lex naturalis) is a philosophy asserting that certain rights are inherent by virtue of human nature, endowed by nature—traditionally by God or a transcendent source—and that these can be understood universally through human reason.  As determined by nature, the law of nature is implied to be universal,    existing independently of the positive law of a given state, political order, legislature or society at large. Historically, natural law refers to the use of reason to analyze human nature to deduce binding rules of moral behavior from nature's or God's creation of reality and mankind. 

Nestorianism<====>22065<====>Nestorianism  Nestorianism is a  Christological doctrine that emphasizes a distinction between the human and divine natures of the divine person, Jesus.  It was advanced by Nestorius (386–450), Patriarch of Constantinople from 428 to 431, influenced by Nestorius's studies under Theodore of Mopsuestia at the School of Antioch.  Nestorius's teachings brought him into conflict with other prominent church leaders, most notably Cyril of Alexandria, who criticized especially his rejection of the title Theotokos ("Mother of God") for  Mary, the mother of Jesus.  Nestorius and his teachings were eventually condemned as heretical at the Council of Ephesus in 431 and the Council of Chalcedon in 451, which led to the Nestorian Schism; churches supporting Nestorius broke with the rest of the Christian Church. 

Naomi Klein<====>22068<====>Naomi Klein  Naomi Klein (born May 8, 1970) is a Canadian author, social activist, and filmmaker known for her political analyses and criticism of corporate globalization and of capitalism.   She first became known internationally for her book No Logo (1999); The Take (2004), a documentary film about Argentina’s occupied factories, written by Klein and directed by her husband Avi Lewis; and significantly for The Shock Doctrine (2007), a critical analysis of the history of neoliberal economics that was adapted into a six-minute companion film by Alfonso and Jonás Cuarón,  as well as a feature-length documentary by Michael Winterbottom. 

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug<====>22071<====>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug   Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a drug class that groups together drugs that reduce pain, decrease fever, and, in higher doses, decrease inflammation.  Side effects include an increased risk of stomach ulcers and heart attacks.   The term nonsteroidal distinguishes these drugs from steroids, which, among a broad range of other effects, have a similar eicosanoid-depressing, anti-inflammatory action.  First used in 1960, the term served to distance these medications from steroids.    The most prominent members of this group of drugs are aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen, all available over the counter in most countries. 

NC (complexity)<====>22073<====>NC (complexity) In complexity theory, the class NC (for "Nick's Class") is the set of decision problems decidable in polylogarithmic time on a parallel computer with a polynomial number of processors.   In other words, a problem is in NC if there exist constants c and k such that it can be solved in time O(log c  n) using O(n k ) parallel processors.  Stephen Cook coined the name "Nick's class" after Nick Pippenger, who had done extensive research on circuits with polylogarithmic depth and polynomial size.  Arora & Barak (2009) p. 120 Just as the class P can be thought of as the tractable problems (Cobham's thesis), so NC can be thought of as the problems that can be efficiently solved on a parallel computer. 

Nori<====>22076<====>Nori is the Japanese name for edible seaweed species of the red algae genus Pyropia, including P.  yezoensis and P.  tenera.  It is used chiefly as an ingredient (wrap) of sushi.  Finished products are made by a shredding and rack-drying process that resembles papermaking. HistoryOriginally, the term nori was generic and referred to seaweeds, including hijiki.   One of the oldest descriptions of nori is dated to around the 8th century.  In the Taihō Code enacted in 701, nori was already included in the form of taxation.   Local people have been described as drying nori in Hitachi Province Fudoki (721–721), and nori was harvested in Izumo Province Fudoki (713–733), showing that nori was used as food from ancient times. 

Normative ethics<====>22081<====>Normative ethics Normative ethics is the study of ethical action.  It is the branch of philosophical ethics that investigates the set of questions that arise when considering how one ought to act, morally speaking.  Normative ethics is distinct from meta-ethics because it examines standards for the rightness and wrongness of actions, while meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts.  Normative ethics is also distinct from descriptive ethics, as the latter is an empirical investigation of people’s moral beliefs.  To put it another way, descriptive ethics would be concerned with determining what proportion of people believe that killing is always wrong, while normative ethics is concerned with whether it is correct to hold such a belief. 

Negotiation<====>22083<====>Negotiation   Negotiation is a dialogue between two or more people or parties intended to reach a beneficial outcome over one or more issues where a conflict exists with respect to at least one of these issues.  This beneficial outcome can be for all of the parties involved, or just for one or some of them. It is aimed to resolve points of difference, to gain advantage for an individual or collective, or to craft outcomes to satisfy various interests.  It is often conducted by putting forward a position and making small concessions to achieve an agreement. 

Fertility awareness<====>22085<====>Fertility awareness Fertility awareness (FA) refers to a set of practices used to determine the fertile and infertile phases of a woman's menstrual cycle.  Fertility awareness methods may be used to avoid pregnancy, to achieve pregnancy, or as a way to monitor gynecological health. Methods of identifying infertile days have been known since antiquity, but scientific knowledge gained during the past century has increased the number and variety of methods. Systems of fertility awareness rely on observation of changes in one or more of the primary fertility signs (basal body temperature, cervical mucus, and cervical position), tracking menstrual cycle length and identifying the fertile window based on this information, or both. 

Nicaragua Canal<====>22087<====>Nicaragua Canal The Nicaraguan Canal ( ), formally the Nicaraguan Canal and Development Project (also referred to as the Nicaragua Grand Canal, or the Grand Interoceanic Canal) is a planned shipping route  through Nicaragua to connect the Caribbean Sea (and therefore the Atlantic Ocean) with the Pacific Ocean.  Its viability has been questioned by shipping experts and engineers.   "Major works" such as dredging will take place after the finishing of a Pacific Ocean wharf, whose construction was planned to start in late 2016.    In June 2013, Nicaragua's National Assembly approved a bill to grant a 50-year concession to finance and manage the project to the private Hong Kong Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Company (HKND Group) headed by Wang Jing, a Chinese billionaire. 

Nu metal<====>22090<====>Nu metal  Nu metal (also known as nü-metal and  ) is a form of   that combines elements of   with elements of other music genres such as hip hop, alternative rock, funk and grunge.    bands have drawn elements and influences from a variety of musical styles, including multiple genres of heavy metal.    rarely features guitar solos; the genre is heavily syncopated and based on guitar riffs.  Many nu metal guitarists use   that are down-tuned to play a heavier sound.  DJs are occasionally featured in nu metal to provide instrumentation such as sampling, turntable scratching and electronic backgrounds. 

Ncurses<====>22091<====>Ncurses  ncurses (new curses) is a programming library providing an application programming interface (API) that allows the programmer to write text-based user interfaces in a terminal-independent manner.  It is a toolkit for developing "GUI-like" application software that runs under a terminal emulator.  It also optimizes screen changes, in order to reduce the latency experienced when using remote shells. HistoryAs the new version, ncurses is a free-software emulation of the System V Release 4. 0 (SVr4) curses, which was itself an enhancement over the discontinued 4. 4 BSD curses.   The XSI Curses standard issued by X/Open is explicitly and closely modeled on System V. 

National Basketball Association<====>22093<====>National Basketball AssociationThe National Basketball Association (NBA) is a men's professional basketball league in North America; composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada).  It is widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world.  The NBA is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB),  which is recognized by FIBA (also known as the International Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for basketball in the United States.  The NBA is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. 

Nutation<====>22094<====>Nutation Nutation (from Latin nūtātiō, "nodding, swaying") is a rocking, swaying, or nodding motion in the axis of rotation of a largely axially symmetric object, such as a gyroscope, planet, or bullet in flight, or as an intended behavior of a mechanism.  In an appropriate reference frame it can be defined as a change in the second Euler angle.  If it is not caused by forces external to the body, it is called free nutation or Euler nutation.   A pure nutation is a movement of a rotational axis such that the first Euler angle is constant. 

North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization<====>22097<====>North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization  The North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization (NASCO) is an international organization established under the Convention for the Conservation of Salmon in the North Atlantic Ocean from 1 October 1983.  The organization's mission is to contribute through consultation and cooperation to the conservation, restoration, enhancement and rational management of salmon stocks.Its headquarters are in Edinburgh, United Kingdom.MembershipCurrent participants (since 1984): Canada, Denmark (in respect of the Faroe Islands and Greenland), the European Union, Norway, Russian Federation, and the United States of America.Former participants:Iceland (1984-2009) Finland (1984-1995)  Convention for the conservation of salmon in the North Atlantic ocean Sweden (1984-1995)  References External linksOfficial website

Narcissus (mythology)<====>22099<====>Narcissus (mythology) In Greek mythology, Narcissus ( ;  , Nárkissos) was a hunter from Thespiae in Boeotia who was known for his beauty.  He was the son of the river god Cephissus and nymph Liriope.   He was proud, in that he disdained those who loved him.  Nemesis noticed this behavior and attracted Narcissus to a pool, where he saw his own reflection in the water and fell in love with it, not realizing it was merely an image.  Unable to leave the beauty of his reflection, Narcissus lost his will to live.  He stared at his reflection until he died. 

Naval mine<====>22102<====>Naval mine A naval mine is a self-contained explosive device placed in water to damage or destroy surface ships or submarines.  Unlike depth charges, mines are deposited and left to wait until they are triggered by the approach of, or contact with, an enemy vessel.  Naval mines can be used offensively—to hamper enemy shipping movements or lock vessels into a harbour; or defensively—to protect friendly vessels and create "safe" zones. DescriptionMines can be laid in many ways: by purpose-built minelayers, refitted ships, submarines, or aircraft—and even by dropping them into a harbour by hand.  They can be inexpensive: some variants can cost as little as US$2000, though more sophisticated mines can cost millions of dollars, be equipped with several kinds of sensors, and deliver a warhead by rocket or torpedo. 

Nawal El Moutawakel<====>22104<====>Nawal El Moutawakel  Nawal El Moutawakel (Amazigh: Nawal Lmutawakkil ;  ) (born on April 15, 1962 in Casablanca) is a former Moroccan hurdler, who won the inaugural women's 400 metres hurdles event at the 1984 Summer Olympics, thereby becoming the first female Muslim born on the continent of Africa to become an Olympic champion.   She was also the first Moroccan and the first woman from a Muslim majority country to win an Olympic gold medal.   In 2007, El Moutawakel was named the Minister of Sports in the upcoming cabinet of Morocco. LifeAlthough she had been a quite accomplished runner, the victory of El Moutawakel, who studied at Iowa State University  at the time, was a surprise. 

North Melbourne Football Club<====>22106<====>North Melbourne Football Club   The North Melbourne Football Club, nicknamed the Kangaroos or less formally the Roos, the Kangas or North, is the fourth oldest Australian rules football club in the Australian Football League (AFL) and is one of the oldest sporting clubs in Australia and the world.  It is based at the Arden Street Oval in the inner Melbourne suburb of North Melbourne, Victoria, but plays its home matches at the nearby Docklands Stadium. The club's mascot is a grey kangaroo, and its use dates from the middle of the 20th century.  The club is also unofficially known as "The Shinboners", a term which dates back to its 19th-century abattoir-worker origins. 

Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons<====>22107<====>Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, commonly known as the Non-Proliferation Treaty or NPT, is an international treaty whose objective is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and to further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament.    Opened for signature in 1968, the treaty entered into force in 1970.  As required by the text, after twenty-five years, NPT Parties met in May 1995 and agreed to extend the treaty indefinitely. 

Nikolai Bukharin<====>22109<====>Nikolai Bukharin    Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin  (  – 15 March 1938) was a Russian Bolshevik revolutionary, Soviet politician and prolific author on revolutionary theory.   As a young man, he spent six years in exile, working closely with fellow exiles Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky.  After the revolution of February 1917, he returned to Moscow, where his Bolshevik credentials earned him a high rank in the party, and after the October Revolution, he became editor of the party newspaper Pravda.  Within the Bolshevik Party, Bukharin was initially a Left Communist, but his gradual move from the left to the right from 1921, as a strong supporter and defender of the New Economic Policy (NEP), eventually saw him lead the Right Opposition. 

Nasal consonant<====>22110<====>Nasal consonant  In phonetics, a nasal, also called a nasal occlusive, nasal stop in contrast with a nasal fricative, or nasal continuant, is an occlusive consonant produced with a lowered velum, allowing air to escape freely through the nose.   Examples of nasals in English are   and  , in words such as nose and mouth.  Nasal occlusives are nearly universal in human languages.  There are also other kinds of nasal consonants in some languages. DefinitionNearly all nasal consonants are nasal occlusives, in which air escapes through the nose but not through the mouth, as it is blocked (occluded) by the lips or tongue. 

Nuvistor<====>22111<====>NuvistorThe nuvistor is a type of vacuum tube announced by RCA in 1959.   Most nuvistors are basically thimble-shaped, but somewhat smaller than a thimble, and much smaller than conventional tubes of the day, almost approaching the compactness of early discrete transistor casings.   Triodes and a few tetrodes were made.  The tube is made entirely of metal and ceramic.  Making nuvistors requires special equipment, since there is no intubation to pump gases out of the envelope.  Instead, the entire structure is assembled, inserted into its metal envelope, sealed and processed in a large vacuum chamber with simple robotic devices. 

No Logo<====>22113<====>No Logo No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies is a book by the Canadian author Naomi Klein.  First published by Knopf Canada and Picador in December 1999,   shortly after the 1999 WTO Ministerial Conference protests in Seattle had generated media attention around such issues, it became one of the most influential books about the alter-globalization movement and an international bestseller.  FocusThe book focuses on branding and often makes connections with the alter-globalization movement.  Throughout the four parts ("No Space", "No Choice", "No Jobs", and "No Logo"), Klein writes about issues such as sweatshops in the Americas and Asia, culture jamming, corporate censorship, and Reclaim the Streets. 

National War College<====>22115<====>National War College  The National War College (NWC) of the United States is a school in the National Defense University.  It is housed in Roosevelt Hall on Fort Lesley J.  McNair, Washington, D. C. , the third-oldest Army post still active. HistoryThe National War College ("NWC") was officially established on July 1, 1946, as an upgraded replacement for the Army-Navy Staff College, which operated from June 1943 to July 1946.  The college was one of James Forrestal's favorite causes.  According to Lt.  Gen.  Leonard T.  Gerow, President of the Board which recommended its formation, The College is concerned with grand strategy and the utilization of the national resources necessary to implement that strategy.

Norn language<====>22118<====>Norn language  Norn is an extinct North Germanic language that was spoken in the Northern Isles (Orkney and Shetland) off the north coast of mainland Scotland and in Caithness in the far north of the Scottish mainland.  After Orkney and Shetland were pledged to Scotland by Norway in 1468/69, it was gradually replaced by Scots. HistoryNorse settlement in the islands probably began in the early 9th century.   These settlers are believed to have arrived in very substantial numbers and like those who migrated to Iceland and the Faroe Islands it is probable that most came from the west coast of Norway. 

Nuoro<====>22120<====>Nuoro Nuoro (  ;   DOP)   is a city and comune (municipality) in central-eastern Sardinia, Italy, situated on the slopes of the Monte Ortobene.  It is the capital of the province of Nuoro.  With a population of 36,347 (2011),  it is the sixth-largest city in Sardinia. Birthplace of several renowned artists, including writers, poets, painters, and sculptors, Nuoro hosts some of the most important museums in Sardinia.  It is considered an important cultural center of the region  and it has been referred as the "Atene sarda" (Sardinian Athens). 

Nürburgring<====>22122<====>Nürburgring Nürburgring is a 150,000-capacity motorsports complex located in the town of Nürburg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.  It features a Grand Prix race track built in 1984, and a much longer old "North loop" track which was built in the 1920s around the village and medieval castle of Nürburg in the Eifel mountains.  The north loop is   long and has more than 300 metres (1,000 feet) of elevation change from its lowest to highest points.  Jackie Stewart nicknamed the old track "The Green Hell".  Originally, the track featured four configurations: the  -long Gesamtstrecke ("Whole Course"), which in turn consisted of the   Nordschleife ("North Loop"), and the   Südschleife ("South Loop"). 

Northern Hemisphere<====>22126<====>Northern Hemisphere  The Northern Hemisphere is the half of Earth that is north of the Equator.  For other planets in the Solar System, north is defined as being in the same celestial hemisphere relative to the invariable plane of the solar system as Earth's North pole.  Report of the IAU Working Group on cartographic coordinates and rotational elements: 2009  Owing to the Earth's axial tilt, winter in the Northern Hemisphere lasts from the December solstice (typically December 21 UTC) to the March equinox (typically March 20 UTC), while summer lasts from the June solstice (typically June 21 UTC) through to the September equinox (typically September 23 UTC). 

Noun class<====>22130<====>Noun class In linguistics, a noun class is a particular category of nouns.  A noun may belong to a given class because of the characteristic features of its referent, such as sex, animacy, shape, but counting a given noun among nouns of such or another class is often clearly conventional.  Some authors use the term "grammatical gender" as a synonym of "noun class", but others use different definitions for each.  Noun classes should not be confused with noun classifiers. NotionIn general, there are three main ways by which natural languages categorize nouns into noun classes:according to similarities in their meaning (semantic criterion),by grouping them with other nouns that have similar form (morphology), orthrough an arbitrary convention. 

Natural gas<====>22131<====>Natural gas  Natural gas is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes, and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium.   It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years.  The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas.    Natural gas is a fossil fuel used as a source of energy for heating, cooking, and electricity generation. 

Nuclear chain reaction<====>22133<====>Nuclear chain reactionA nuclear chain reaction occurs when one single nuclear reaction causes an average of one or more subsequent nuclear reactions, thus leading to the possibility of a self-propagating series of these reactions.   The specific nuclear reaction may be the fission of heavy isotopes (e. g. , uranium-235,  235 U).   The nuclear chain reaction releases several million times more energy per reaction than any chemical reaction. HistoryChemical chain reactions were first proposed by German chemist Max Bodenstein in 1913, and were reasonably well understood before nuclear chain reactions were proposed.   It was understood that chemical chain reactions were responsible for exponentially increasing rates in reactions, such as produced in chemical explosions. 

Nichiren<====>22135<====>Nichiren  Nichiren also known as "Nichiren Shonin" or "Nichiren Daishonin" (日蓮; 16 February 1222 – 13 October 1282), born as  , was a Japanese Buddhist priest who lived during the Kamakura period (1185–1333). Nichiren is known for his sole devotion to the Lotus Sutra, asserting that it was Shakyamuni Buddha's ultimate teachings and was the exclusive method to attain enlightenment. He believed that the Lotus Sutra contained the essence of all of Shakyamuni Buddha's teachings related to the laws of causality, karma, without any distinction to enlightenment.   His interpretation of the Lotus Sutra centers on the emphasis of its 16th chapter, The Life Span of the Thus Come One, where he asserts his revelation that the chanting of Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō is the superior practice of today's age of Mappō. 

Nichiren Buddhism<====>22137<====>Nichiren Buddhism  Nichiren Buddhism is a branch of Mahayana Buddhism based on the teachings of the 13th century Japanese Buddhist priest Nichiren (1222–1282) and is one of the "Kamakura Buddhism" schools.    Its teachings derive from the 300 extant letters and treatises written by Nichiren.   Within Nichiren Buddhism there are two major divisions which fundamentally differ over whether Nichiren should be regarded as a bodhisattva of the earth, a saint, great teacher--or the actual Buddha of the third age of Buddhism.    Several of Japan's New Religious Movements are Nichiren-inspired lay groups. 

Newport News Shipbuilding<====>22141<====>Newport News Shipbuilding Newport News Shipbuilding (NNS), a division of Huntington Ingalls Industries, is the largest industrial employer in Virginia, and sole designer, builder and refueler of U. S.  Navy aircraft carriers and one of two providers of U. S.  Navy submarines.  Founded as the Chesapeake Dry Dock and Construction Co.  in 1886, Newport News Shipbuilding has built more than 800 ships, including both naval and commercial ships.  Located in the city of Newport News, their facilities span more than  , strategically positioned in one of the great harbors of the East Coast. The shipyard is a major employer not only for the lower Virginia Peninsula, but also portions of Hampton Roads south of the James River and the harbor, portions of the Middle Peninsula region, and even some northeastern counties of North Carolina. 

Newton's method<====>22145<====>Newton's method  In numerical analysis, Newton's method (also known as the Newton–Raphson method), named after Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson, is a method for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.  It is one example of a root-finding algorithm.  x : f(x) = 0 \,.  The Newton–Raphson method in one variable is implemented as follows:The method starts with a function   defined over the real numbers  , the function's derivative  , and an initial guess   for a root of the function  .  If the function satisfies the assumptions made in the derivation of the formula and the initial guess is close, then a better approximation   is x_{1} = x_0 - \frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} \,. 

New Order (band)<====>22146<====>New Order (band)    New Order are   an English rock band formed in 1980 by vocalist and guitarist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris.  New Order were formed in the demise of their previous post-punk band Joy Division, following the suicide of vocalist Ian Curtis.  They were joined by Gillian Gilbert on keyboards later that year.  Their integration of post-punk with electronic and dance music made them one of the most critically acclaimed and influential bands of the 1980s.  While the band's early years were shadowed by the legacy of Joy Division, their experience of the early 1980s New York club scene saw New Order incorporate dance rhythms and electronic instrumentation into their work, to critical praise. 

Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia<====>22148<====>Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia ( ; 1499/1500, Brescia – 13 December 1557, Venice) was an Italian mathematician, engineer (designing fortifications), a surveyor (of topography, seeking the best means of defense or offense) and a bookkeeper from the then-Republic of Venice (now part of Italy).  He published many books, including the first Italian translations of Archimedes and Euclid, and an acclaimed compilation of mathematics.  Tartaglia was the first to apply mathematics to the investigation of the paths of cannonballs, known as ballistics, in his Nova Scientia (A New Science); his work was later partially validated and partially superseded by Galileo's studies on falling bodies. 

Nagarjuna<====>22149<====>NagarjunaNāgārjuna (c.  150 – c.  250 CE) is widely considered one of the most important Mahayana philosophers.   Along with his disciple Āryadeva, he is considered to be the founder of the Madhyamaka school of Mahāyāna Buddhism.  Nāgārjuna is also credited with developing the philosophy of the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras and, in some sources, with having revealed these scriptures in the world, having recovered them from the nāgas (water spirits often depicted in the form of serpent-like humans).  Furthermore, he is traditionally supposed to have written several treatises on rasayana as well as serving a term as the head of Nālandā. 

Nuclear reactor<====>22151<====>Nuclear reactorThis article is a subarticle of Nuclear power. A nuclear reactor, formerly known as an atomic pile, is a device used to initiate and control a sustained nuclear chain reaction.  Nuclear reactors are used at nuclear power plants for electricity generation and in propulsion of ships.  Heat from nuclear fission is passed to a working fluid (water or gas), which runs through steam turbines.  These either drive a ship's propellers or turn electrical generators.  Nuclear generated steam in principle can be used for industrial process heat or for district heating.  Some reactors are used to produce isotopes for medical and industrial use, or for production of weapons-grade plutonium. 

Nuclear power<====>22153<====>Nuclear power Nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions that release nuclear energy    to generate heat, which most frequently is then used in steam turbines to produce electricity in a nuclear power plant.  The term includes nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion.  Presently, the nuclear fission of elements in the actinide series of the periodic table produce the vast majority of nuclear energy in the direct service of humankind, with nuclear decay processes, primarily in the form of geothermal energy, and radioisotope thermoelectric generators, in niche uses making up the rest.

Nuclear proliferation<====>22158<====>Nuclear proliferation    Nuclear proliferation is the spread of nuclear weapons, fissionable material, and weapons-applicable nuclear technology and information to nations not recognized as "Nuclear Weapon States" by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, commonly known as the Non-Proliferation Treaty or NPT.  Proliferation has been opposed by many nations with and without nuclear weapons, the governments of which fear that more countries with nuclear weapons may increase the possibility of nuclear warfare (up to and including the so-called "countervalue" targeting of civilians with nuclear weapons), de-stabilize international or regional relations, or infringe upon the national sovereignty of states. 

Netlist<====>22164<====>Netlist  In electronic design, a netlist is a description of the connectivity of an electronic circuit.  In its simplest form, a netlist consists of a list of the electronic components in a circuit and a list of the nodes they are connected to.  A network (net) is a collection of two or more interconnected components.  The structure, complexity and representation of netlists can vary considerably, but the fundamental purpose of every netlist is to convey connectivity information.  Netlists usually provide nothing more than instances, nodes, and perhaps some attributes of the components involved.  If they express much more than this, they are usually considered to be a hardware description language such as Verilog or VHDL, or one of several languages specifically designed for input to simulators. 

Nuclear disarmament<====>22165<====>Nuclear disarmament  Nuclear disarmament refers to both the act of reducing or eliminating nuclear weapons and to the end state of a nuclear-weapons-free world, in which nuclear weapons are completely eliminated. Nuclear disarmament groups include the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Peace Action, Greenpeace,  Soka Gakkai International, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, Mayors for Peace, Global Zero, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, and the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation.  There have been many large anti-nuclear demonstrations and protests.  On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City's Central Park against nuclear weapons and for an end to the cold war arms race. 

Net (mathematics)<====>22170<====>Net (mathematics) In mathematics, more specifically in general topology and related branches, a net or Moore–Smith sequence is a generalization of the notion of a sequence.  In essence, a sequence is a function with domain the natural numbers, and in the context of topology, the codomain of this function is usually any topological space.  However, in the context of topology, sequences do not fully encode all information about a function between topological spaces.  In particular, the following two conditions are not equivalent in general for a map f between topological spaces X and Y:The map f is continuous (in the topological sense)Given any point x in X, and any sequence in X converging to x, the composition of f with this sequence converges to f(x) (continuous in the sequential sense)It is true, however, that condition 1 implies condition 2. 

Nuclear winter<====>22171<====>Nuclear winter  Nuclear winter is the severe and prolonged global climatic cooling effect hypothesized   to occur after widespread firestorms following a nuclear war.  Environmental consequences of nuclear war by Owen B.  Toon, Alan Robock, and Richard P.  Turco.  Physics Today, December 2008.  ". . . environmental changes triggered by smoke from firestorms. "  The hypothesis is based on the fact that such fires can inject soot into the stratosphere, where it can block some direct sunlight from reaching the surface of the Earth.  Historically, firestorms have occurred in a number of forests and cities. 

Ode<====>22172<====>Ode An ode (from  ) is a type of lyrical stanza.  It is an elaborately structured poem praising or glorifying an event or individual, describing nature intellectually as well as emotionally.  A classic ode is structured in three major parts: the strophe, the antistrophe, and the epode.  Different forms such as the homostrophic ode and the irregular ode also exist. Greek odes were originally poetic pieces performed with musical accompaniment.  As time passed on, they gradually became known as personal lyrical compositions whether sung (with or without musical instruments) or merely recited (always with accompaniment). 

Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens<====>22189<====>Temple of Olympian Zeus, AthensThe Temple of Olympian Zeus ( , Naos tou Olympiou Dios), also known as the Olympieion or Columns of the Olympian Zeus, is a monument of Greece and a former colossal temple at the centre of the Greek capital Athens.  It was dedicated to Olympian Zeus, a name originating from his position as head of the Olympian gods.  Construction began in the 6th century BC during the rule of the Athenian tyrants, who envisaged building the greatest temple in the ancient world, but it was not completed until the reign of the Roman Emperor Hadrian in the 2nd century AD, some 638 years after the project had begun. 

Organic electronics<====>22190<====>Organic electronicsOrganic electronics is a field of materials science concerning the design, synthesis, characterization, and application of organic small molecules or polymers that show desirable electronic properties such as conductivity.  Unlike conventional inorganic conductors and semiconductors, organic electronic materials are constructed from organic (carbon-based) small molecules or polymers using synthetic strategies developed in the context of organic and polymer chemistry.  One of the promised benefits of organic electronics is their potential low cost compared to traditional inorganic electronics.    Attractive properties of polymeric conductors include their electrical conductivity that can be varied by the concentrations of dopants. 

Operating system<====>22194<====>Operating system    An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.  Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources. For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware,   although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. 

Orson Welles<====>22196<====>Orson Welles   George Orson Welles ( ; May 6, 1915 – October 10, 1985) was an American actor, director, writer, and producer who worked in theatre, radio, and film.  He is remembered for his innovative  work in all three: in theatre, most notably Caesar (1937), a Broadway adaptation of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar; in radio, the legendary  1938 broadcast "The War of the Worlds"; and in film, Citizen Kane (1941), consistently ranked as one of the greatest films ever made. In his 20s, Welles directed a number of high-profile stage productions for the Federal Theatre Project, including an adaptation of Macbeth with an entirely African American cast, and the political musical The Cradle Will Rock. 

Open content<====>22197<====>Open content  Open content is a neologism coined by David Wiley in 1998    which describes a creative work that others can copy or modify freely, without asking for permission.  The term evokes the related concept of open-source software.Such content is said to be under an open licence. HistoryOriginally, the Open content concept and term was evangelized via the Open Content Project by David A.  Wiley in 1998, and described works licensed under the Open Content License (a non-free share-alike license, see 'Free content' below) and other works licensed under similar terms. 

Ohio<====>22199<====>Ohio Ohio   is a Midwestern state in the Great Lakes region of the United States.  Ohio is the 34th largest by area, the 7th most populous, and the 10th most densely populated of the 50 United States.  The state's capital and largest city is Columbus. The state takes its name from the Ohio River.  The name originated from the Seneca language word  ohiːyo, meaning "great river" or "large creek".  Partitioned from the Northwest Territory, the state was admitted to the Union as the 17th state (and the first under the Northwest Ordinance) on March 1, 1803. 

Organic compound<====>22203<====>Organic compound An organic compound is virtually any chemical compound that contains carbon, although a consensus definition remains elusive and  likely arbitrary.  Spencer L.  Seager, Michael R.  Slabaugh.  Chemistry for Today: general, organic, and biochemistry.  Thomson Brooks/Cole, 2004, p.  342.However, the traditional definition used by most chemists is limited to compounds containing a carbon-hydrogen bond.  Organic compounds are rare terrestrially, but of central importance because all known life is based on organic compounds.  The most basic petrochemicals are considered the building blocks of organic chemistry.  Definitions of organic vs inorganicFor historical reasons discussed below, a few types of carbon-containing compounds, such as carbides, carbonates, simple oxides of carbon (for example, CO and CO 2 ), and cyanides are considered inorganic. 

Oligopoly<====>22204<====>Oligopoly An oligopoly (from Ancient Greek ὀλίγος (olígos) "few" + πωλεῖν (polein) "to sell") is a market form wherein a market or industry is dominated by a small number of sellers (oligopolists).   Oligopolies can result from various forms of collusion which reduce competition and lead to higher prices for consumers.  Oligopoly has its own market structure.  With few sellers, each oligopolist is likely to be aware of the actions of the others.  According to game theory, the decisions of one firm therefore influence and are influenced by decisions of other firms.  Strategic planning by oligopolists needs to take into account the likely responses of the other market. 

Oasis<====>22205<====>Oasis  In geography, an oasis ( ; plural: oases  ) is an isolated area in a desert, typically surrounding a spring or similar water source, such as a pond or small lake.  Oases also provide habitat for animals and even humans if the area is big enough.  The location of oases has been of critical importance for trade and transportation routes in desert areas; caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished.  Thus, political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route. 

Oboe<====>22206<====>Oboe    Oboes (   ) are a family of double reed woodwind instruments.  The most common oboe plays in the treble or soprano range.  Oboes are usually made of wood, but there are also oboes made of synthetic materials.  A soprano oboe measures roughly   long, with metal keys, a conical bore and a flared bell.  Sound is produced by blowing into the reed and vibrating a column of air.  The distinctive tone is versatile and has been described as "bright".   When oboe is used alone, it is generally taken to mean the treble instrument rather than other instruments of the family, such as the cor anglais (English horn) or oboe d'amore. 

Organic chemistry<====>22208<====>Organic chemistry   Organic chemistry is a chemistry subdiscipline involving the scientific study of the structure, properties, and reactions of organic compounds and organic materials, i. e. , matter in its various forms that contain carbon atoms.  Clayden, J. ; Greeves, N.  and Warren, S.  (2012) Organic Chemistry.  Oxford University Press.  pp.  1–15.   .   Study of structure includes many physical and chemical methods to determine the chemical composition and the chemical constitution of organic compounds and materials.  Study of properties includes both physical properties and chemical properties, and uses similar methods as well as methods to evaluate chemical reactivity, with the aim to understand the behavior of the organic matter in its pure form (when possible), but also in solutions, mixtures, and fabricated forms. 

Orthography<====>22209<====>Orthography   An orthography is a set of conventions for writing a language.  It includes norms of spelling, hyphenation, capitalization, word breaks, emphasis, and punctuation. Most significant languages in the modern era are written down, and for most such languages a standard orthography has been developed, often based on a standard variety of the language, and thus exhibiting less dialect variation than the spoken language.  Sometimes there may be variation in a language's orthography, as between American and British spelling in the case of English orthography.  In some languages orthography is regulated by language academies, although for many languages (including English) there are no such authorities, and orthography develops in a more organic way. 

One-time pad<====>22210<====>One-time pad In cryptography, the one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked, but requires the use of a one-time pre-shared key the same size as, or longer than, the message being sent.  In this technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (also referred to as a one-time pad).  Then, each bit or character of the plaintext is encrypted by combining it with the corresponding bit or character from the pad using modular addition.  If the key is truly random, is at least as long as the plaintext, is never reused in whole or in part, and is kept completely secret, then the resulting ciphertext will be impossible to decrypt or break.

It is also home to the headquarters of GEA ( Westfalia Separator), a manufacturer of centrifuges and dairy machines. 

Operator (mathematics)<====>22213<====>Operator (mathematics)  In mathematics, an operator is generally a mapping that acts on the elements of a space to produce other elements of the same space.  The most common operators are linear maps, which act on vector spaces.  However, when using "linear operator" instead of "linear map", mathematicians often mean actions on vector spaces of functions, which also preserve other properties, such as continuity.  For example, differentiation and indefinite integration are linear operators; operators that are built from them are called differential operators, integral operators or integro-differential operators. Operator is also used for denoting the symbol of a mathematical operation. 

O Brother, Where Art Thou?<====>22216<====>O Brother, Where Art Thou?   O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a 2000 crime comedy film written, produced, and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, and starring George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson, with John Goodman, Holly Hunter, and Charles Durning in supporting roles. The film is set in 1937 rural Mississippi  during the Great Depression, and its story is a modern satire loosely based on Homer's epic poem Odyssey.  The title of the film is a reference to the 1941 film Sullivan's Travels, in which the protagonist is a director who wants to film O Brother, Where Art Thou?, a fictional book about the Great Depression. 

Ohio State University<====>22217<====>Ohio State University    The Ohio State University, commonly referred to as Ohio State or OSU, is a large, primarily residential,  public university in Columbus, Ohio.  Founded in 1870 as a land-grant university and ninth university in Ohio with the Morrill Act of 1862,  the university was originally known as the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College (Mech).  The college began with a focus on training students in various agricultural and mechanical disciplines but was developed into a comprehensive university under the direction of then Governor (later, President) Rutherford B.  Hayes, and in 1878 the Ohio General Assembly passed a law changing the name to "The Ohio State University". 

Ontario<====>22218<====>Ontario    Ontario ( ;  ), one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is in east-central Canada.   Ontario is located in the geographic eastern half of Canada, but it has historically and politically been considered to be part of Central Canada (along with Manitoba).   It is Canada's most populous province    accounting for nearly 40 percent  of the country's population, and is the second-largest province in total area.  Ontario is fourth-largest in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included.It is home to the nation's capital city, Ottawa, and the nation's most populous city, Toronto. 

Ottawa<====>22219<====>Ottawa    Ottawa (  or  ;  ) is the capital city of Canada.  It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of southern Ontario.  Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec; the two form the core of the Ottawa–Gatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR).   As of 2016, Ottawa had a city population of 934,243 and a metropolitan population of 1,323,783 making it the fourth-largest city and the fifth-largest CMA in Canada. Founded in 1826 as Bytown, and incorporated as Ottawa in 1855, the city has evolved into the political centre of Canada. 

Objectivism (Ayn Rand)<====>22256<====>Objectivism (Ayn Rand)   Objectivism is a philosophical system developed by Russian-American writer Ayn Rand (1905–1982). Rand first expressed Objectivism in her fiction, most notably The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged (1957), and later in non-fiction essays and books.    Leonard Peikoff, a professional philosopher and Rand's designated intellectual heir,    later gave it a more formal structure. Peikoff characterizes Objectivism as a "closed system" that is not subject to change. Objectivism's central tenets are that reality exists independently of consciousness, that human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception, that one can attain objective knowledge from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive logic, that the proper moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness (rational self-interest), that the only social system consistent with this morality is one that displays full respect for individual rights embodied in laissez-faire capitalism, and that the role of art in human life is to transform humans' metaphysical ideas by selective reproduction of reality into a physical form—a work of art—that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally.Academic philosophers have mostly ignored or rejected Rand's philosophy.  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;    Nonetheless, Objectivism has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives.  ;    The Objectivist movement, which Rand founded, attempts to spread her ideas to the public and in academic settings. PhilosophyRand originally expressed her philosophical ideas in her novels, most notably, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. She further elaborated on them in her periodicals The Objectivist Newsletter, The Objectivist, and The Ayn Rand Letter, and in non-fiction books such as Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology and The Virtue of Selfishness.   The name "Objectivism" derives from the idea that human knowledge and values are objective: they exist and are determined by the nature of reality, to be discovered by one's mind, and are not created by the thoughts one has.  Rand stated that she chose the name because her preferred term for a philosophy based on the primacy of existence—"existentialism"—had already been taken. Rand characterized Objectivism as "a philosophy for living on earth", grounded in reality, and aimed at defining human nature and the nature of the world in which we live.  Metaphysics: objective realityRand's philosophy begins with three axioms: existence, consciousness, and identity.  Rand defined an axiom as "a statement that identifies the base of knowledge and of any further statement pertaining to that knowledge, a statement necessarily contained in all others whether any particular speaker chooses to identify it or not. An axiom is a proposition that defeats its opponents by the fact that they have to accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it."  As Objectivist philosopher Leonard Peikoff argued, Rand's argument for axioms "is not a proof that the axioms of existence, consciousness, and identity are true. It is proof that they are axioms, that they are at the base of knowledge and thus inescapable." Rand held that existence is the perceptually self-evident fact at the base of all other knowledge, i.e., that "existence exists." She further held that to be is to be something, that "existence is identity." That is, to be is to be "an entity of a specific nature made of specific attributes." That which has no nature or attributes does not and cannot exist. The axiom of existence is grasped in differentiating something from nothing, while the law of identity is grasped in differentiating one thing from another, i.e., one's first awareness of the law of non-contradiction, another crucial base for the rest of knowledge. As Rand wrote, "A leaf ... cannot be all red and green at the same time, it cannot freeze and burn at the same time... A is A."  Objectivism rejects belief in anything alleged to transcend existence. Rand argued that consciousness is "the faculty of perceiving that which exists." As she put it, "to be conscious is to be conscious of something", that is consciousness itself cannot be distinguished or grasped except in relation to an independent reality.  "It cannot be aware only of itself—there is no 'itself' until it is aware of something."    Thus, Objectivism holds that the mind does not create reality, but rather, it is a means of discovering reality.    Expressed differently, existence has "primacy" over consciousness, which must conform to it. Any other approach Rand termed "the primacy of consciousness", including any variant of metaphysical subjectivism or theism. Objectivist philosophy derives its explanations of action and causation from the axiom of identity, calling causation "the law of identity applied to action."  According to Rand, it is entities that act, and every action is the action of an entity. The way entities act is caused by the specific nature (or "identity") of those entities; if they were different they would act differently. As with the other axioms, an implicit understanding of causation is derived from one's primary observations of causal connections among entities even before it is verbally identified, and serves as the basis of further knowledge. Epistemology: reasonAccording to Rand, attaining knowledge beyond what is given in perception requires both volition (or the exercise of free will) and adherence to a specific method of validation through observation, concept-formation, and the application of inductive and deductive reasoning. For example, a belief in dragons, however sincere, does not mean reality contains any dragons. A process of proof identifying the basis in reality of a claimed item of knowledge is necessary to establish its truth. Objectivist epistemology begins with the principle that "consciousness is identification". This is understood to be a direct consequence of the metaphysical principle that "existence is identity."  Rand defined "reason" as "the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses."  Says Rand, "The fundamental concept of method, the one on which all the others depend, is logic. The distinguishing characteristic of logic (the art of non-contradictory identification) indicates the nature of the actions (actions of consciousness required to achieve a correct identification) and their goal (knowledge)—while omitting the length, complexity or specific steps of the process of logical inference, as well as the nature of the particular cognitive problem involved in any given instance of using logic." According to Rand, consciousness possesses a specific and finite identity, just like everything else that exists; therefore, it must operate by a specific method of validation. An item of knowledge cannot be "disqualified" by being arrived at by a specific process in a particular form. Thus, for Rand, the fact that consciousness must itself possess identity implies the rejection of both universal skepticism based on the "limits" of consciousness, as well as any claim to revelation, emotion or faith based belief.Objectivist epistemology maintains that all knowledge is ultimately based on perception. "Percepts, not sensations, are the given, the self-evident."  Rand considered the validity of the senses to be axiomatic, and claimed that purported arguments to the contrary all commit the fallacy of the "stolen concept"  by presupposing the validity of concepts that, in turn, presuppose the validity of the senses.  She held that perception, being physiologically determined, is incapable of error. For example, optical illusions are errors in the conceptual identification of what is seen, not errors in sight itself.    The validity of sense perception, therefore, is not susceptible to proof (because it is presupposed by all proof as proof is only a matter of adducing sensory evidence) nor should its validity be denied (since the conceptual tools one would have to use to do this are derived from sensory data). Perceptual error, therefore, is not possible. Rand consequently rejected epistemological skepticism, as she holds that the skeptics' claim to knowledge "distorted" by the form or the means of perception is impossible. The Objectivist theory of perception distinguishes between the form and object. The form in which an organism perceives is determined by the physiology of its sensory systems. Whatever form the organism perceives it in, what it perceives—the object of perception—is reality.  Rand consequently rejected the Kantian dichotomy between "things as we perceive them" and "things as they are in themselves." Says Rand, "The attack on man's consciousness and particularly on his conceptual faculty has rested on the unchallenged premise that any knowledge acquired by a process of consciousness is necessarily subjective and cannot correspond to the facts of reality, since it is "processed knowledge...[but] all knowledge is processed knowledge—whether on the sensory, perceptual or conceptual level. An "unprocessed" knowledge would be a knowledge acquired without means of cognition." The aspect of epistemology given the most elaboration by Rand is the theory of concept-formation, which she presented in Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology. She argued that concepts are formed by a process of measurement omission. Peikoff described her view as follows: According to Rand, "[T]he term 'measurements omitted' does not mean, in this context, that measurements are regarded as non-existent; it means that measurements exist, but are not specified. That measurements must exist is an essential part of the process. The principle is: the relevant measurements must exist in some quantity, but may exist in any quantity." Rand argued that concepts are hierarchically organized. Concepts such as 'dog,' which bring together "concretes" available in perception, can be differentiated (into the concepts of 'dachshund,' 'poodle,' etc.) or integrated (along with 'cat,' etc., into the concept of 'animal'). Abstract concepts such as 'animal' can be further integrated, via "abstraction from abstractions", into such concepts as 'living thing.' Concepts are formed in the context of knowledge available. A young child differentiates dogs from cats and chickens, but need not explicitly differentiate them from deep-sea tube worms, or from other types of animals not yet known to him, to form a concept 'dog.' Because of its view of concepts as "open-ended" classifications that go well beyond the characteristics included in their past or current definitions, Objectivist epistemology rejects the analytic-synthetic distinction as a false dichotomy  and denies the possibility of a priori knowledge. Rand rejected "feeling" as sources of knowledge. Rand acknowledged the importance of emotion for human beings, but she maintained that emotions are a consequence of the conscious or subconscious ideas that a person already accepts, not a means of achieving awareness of reality. "Emotions are not tools of cognition."  Rand also rejected all forms of faith or mysticism, terms that she used synonymously. She defined faith as "the acceptance of allegations without evidence or proof, either apart from or against the evidence of one's senses and reason... Mysticism is the claim to some non-sensory, non-rational, non-definable, non-identifiable means of knowledge, such as 'instinct,' 'intuition,' 'revelation,' or any form of 'just knowing.'"  Reliance on revelation is like reliance on a Ouija board; it bypasses the need to show how it connects its results to reality. Faith, for Rand, is not a "short-cut" to knowledge, but a "short-circuit" destroying it. Objectivism acknowledges the facts that human beings have limited knowledge, are vulnerable to error, and do not instantly understand all of the implications of their knowledge.  According to Peikoff, one can be certain of a proposition if all of the available evidence supports it, i.e., it can be logically integrated with the rest of one's knowledge; one is then certain within the context of the evidence. Rand rejected the traditional rationalist/empiricist dichotomy, arguing that it embodies a false alternative: conceptually-based knowledge independent of perception (rationalism) versus perceptually-based knowledge independent of concepts (empiricism). Rand argued that neither is possible because the senses provide the material of knowledge while conceptual processing is also needed to establish knowable propositions.Criticisms on epistemologyThe philosopher John Hospers, who was influenced by Rand and shared her moral and political views, disagreed with her over issues of epistemology.   Some philosophers, such as Tibor Machan, have argued that the Objectivist epistemology is incomplete. For example,   Psychology professor Robert L. Campbell says the relationship between Objectivist epistemology and cognitive science remains unclear because Rand made claims about human cognition and its development which belong to psychology, yet Rand also argued that philosophy is logically prior to psychology and in no way dependent on it. The philosophers Randall Dipert and Roderick Long have argued that Objectivist epistemology conflates the perceptual process by which judgments are formed with the way in which they are to be justified, thereby leaving it unclear how sensory data can validate propositionally structured judgments.   Ethics: self-interest Objectivism includes an extensive treatment of ethical concerns. Rand wrote on morality in her works The Virtue of Selfishness, We the Living, and Atlas Shrugged. Rand defines morality as "a code of values to guide man's choices and actions—the choices and actions that determine the purpose and the course of his life."  Rand maintained that the first question is not what should the code of values be, the first question is "Does man need values at all—and why?" According to Rand, "it is only the concept of 'Life' that makes the concept of 'Value' possible," and, "the fact that a living entity is, determines what it ought to do."  Rand writes: "there is only one fundamental alternative in the universe: existence or non-existence—and it pertains to a single class of entities: to living organisms. The existence of inanimate matter is unconditional, the existence of life is not: it depends on a specific course of action... It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative: the issue of life or death..."Rand argued that the primary focus of man's free will is in the choice: 'to think or not to think'. "Thinking is not an automatic function. In any hour and issue of his life, man is free to think or to evade that effort. Thinking requires a state of full, focused awareness. The act of focusing one's consciousness is volitional. Man can focus his mind to a full, active, purposefully directed awareness of reality—or he can unfocus it and let himself drift in a semiconscious daze, merely reacting to any chance stimulus of the immediate moment, at the mercy of his undirected sensory-perceptual mechanism and of any random, associational connections it might happen to make."  According to Rand, therefore, possessing free will, human beings must choose their values: one does not automatically hold one's own life as his ultimate value. Whether in fact a person's actions promote and fulfill his own life or not is a question of fact, as it is with all other organisms, but whether a person will act to promote his well-being is up to him, not hard-wired into his physiology. "Man has the power to act as his own destroyer—and that is the way he has acted through most of his history." Says Rand, "Man's mind is his basic tool of survival. Life is given to him, survival is not. His body is given to him, its sustenance is not. His mind is given to him, its content is not. To remain alive he must act and before he can act he must know the nature and purpose of his action. He cannot obtain his food without knowledge of food and of the way to obtain it. He cannot dig a ditch—or build a cyclotron—without a knowledge of his aim and the means to achieve it. To remain alive, he must think."  In her novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, she also emphasizes the central importance of productive work, romantic love and art to human happiness, and dramatizes the ethical character of their pursuit. The primary virtue in Objectivist ethics is rationality, as Rand meant it "the recognition and acceptance of reason as one's only source of knowledge, one's only judge of values and one's only guide to action." The purpose of a moral code, Rand held, is to provide the principles by reference to which man can achieve the values his survival requires.  Rand summarizes: Rand's explanation of values presents the view that an individual's primary moral obligation is to achieve his own well-being—it is for his life and his self-interest that an individual ought to adhere to a moral code.  Ethical egoism is a corollary of setting man's life as the moral standard.  Rand believed that rational egoism is the logical consequence of humans following evidence wherever it leads them. The only alternative would be that they live without orientation to reality.A corollary to Rand's endorsement of self-interest is her rejection of the ethical doctrine of altruism—which she defined in the sense of Auguste Comte's altruism (he coined the term), as a moral obligation to live for the sake of others. Rand also rejected subjectivism. A "whim-worshiper" or "hedonist," according to Rand, is not motivated by a desire to live his own human life, but by a wish to live on a sub-human level. Instead of using "that which promotes my (human) life" as his standard of value, he mistakes "that which I (mindlessly happen to) value" for a standard of value, in contradiction of the fact that, existentially, he is a human and therefore rational organism. The "I value" in whim-worship or hedonism can be replaced with "we value," "he values," "they value," or "God values," and still it would remain dissociated from reality. Rand repudiated the equation of rational selfishness with hedonistic or whim-worshiping "selfishness-without-a-self."  She held that the former is good, and the latter evil, and that there is a fundamental difference between them.   For Rand, all of the principal virtues are applications of the role of reason as man's basic tool of survival: rationality, honesty, justice, independence, integrity, productiveness, and pride—each of which she explains in some detail in "The Objectivist Ethics."  The essence of Objectivist ethics is summarized by the oath her Atlas Shrugged character John Galt adhered to: "I swear—by my life and my love of it—that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine." Criticisms on ethicsMany philosophers have criticized Objectivist ethics. The philosopher Robert Nozick argues that Rand's foundational argument in ethics is unsound because it does not explain why someone could not rationally prefer dying and having no values. He argues that her attempt to defend the morality of selfishness is, therefore, an instance of begging the question. Nozick also argues that Rand's solution to David Hume's famous is-ought problem is unsatisfactory. In response, the philosophers Douglas B. Rasmussen and Douglas Den Uyl have argued that Nozick misstated Rand's case.  Charles King criticized Rand's example of an indestructible robot to demonstrate the value of life as incorrect and confusing.  In response, Paul St. F. Blair defended Rand's ethical conclusions, while maintaining that his arguments might not have been approved by Rand. Politics: individual rights and capitalismRand's defense of individual liberty integrates elements from her entire philosophy.  Since reason is the means of human knowledge, it is therefore each person's most fundamental means of survival and is necessary to the achievement of values.  The use or threat of force neutralizes the practical effect of an individual's reason, whether the force originates from the state or from a criminal. According to Rand, "man's mind will not function at the point of a gun."  Therefore, the only type of organized human behavior consistent with the operation of reason is that of voluntary cooperation. Persuasion is the method of reason. By its nature, the overtly irrational cannot rely on the use of persuasion and must ultimately resort to force to prevail.  Thus, Rand saw reason and freedom as correlates, just as she saw mysticism and force as corollaries.  Based on this understanding of the role of reason, Objectivists hold that the initiation of physical force against the will of another is immoral,  as are indirect initiations of force through threats,  fraud,  or breach of contract.  The use of defensive or retaliatory force, on the other hand, is appropriate. Objectivism holds that because the opportunity to use reason without the initiation of force is necessary to achieve moral values, each individual has an inalienable moral right to act as his own judgment directs and to keep the product of his effort. Peikoff, explaining the basis of rights, stated, "In content, as the founding fathers recognized, there is one fundamental right, which has several major derivatives. The fundamental right is the right to life. Its major derivatives are the right to liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness."  "A 'right' is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man's freedom of action in a social context."  These rights are specifically understood to be rights to action, not to specific results or objects, and the obligations created by rights are negative in nature: each individual must refrain from violating the rights of others.  Objectivists reject alternative notions of rights, such as positive rights,  collective rights, or animal rights.  Objectivism holds that the only social system which fully recognizes individual rights is capitalism,  specifically what Rand described as "full, pure, uncontrolled, unregulated laissez-faire capitalism."  Objectivism regards capitalism as the social system which is most beneficial to the poor, but that this isn't its primary justification.  Rather, it is the only moral social system. Objectivism maintains that only societies seeking to establish freedom (or free nations) have a right to self-determination. Objectivism views government as "the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control—i.e., under objectively defined laws;" thus, government is both legitimate and critically important  in order to protect individual rights.  Rand opposed anarchism because she saw putting police and courts on the market as an inherent miscarriage of justice.   Objectivism holds that the proper functions of a government are "the police, to protect men from criminals—the armed services, to protect men from foreign invaders—the law courts, to settle disputes among men according to objectively defined laws," the executive, and legislatures.  Furthermore, in protecting individual rights, the government is acting as an agent of its citizens and "has no rights except the rights delegated to it by the citizens"  and it must act in an impartial manner according to specific, objectively defined laws.  Prominent Objectivists Peikoff and Yaron Brook have since expressed support for other government functions.  Rand argued that limited intellectual property monopolies being granted to certain inventors and artists on a first-to-file basis are moral because she viewed all property as fundamentally intellectual. Furthermore, the value of a commercial product comes in part from the necessary work of its inventors. However, Rand viewed limits on patents and copyrights as important and held that if they were granted in perpetuity, it would necessarily lead to de facto collectivism.Rand opposed racism and any legal application of racism. She considered affirmative action to be an example of legal racism.  Rand advocated the right to legal abortion.  Rand believed capital punishment is morally justified as retribution against a murderer, but dangerous due to the risk of mistakenly executing innocent people and opening the door to state murder. She therefore said she opposed capital punishment "on epistemological, not moral, grounds."  She opposed involuntary military conscription, but also thought those who avoided being drafted should be held criminally liable.  She opposed any form of censorship, including legal restrictions on pornography, opinion or worship, famously quipping; "In the transition to statism, every infringement of human rights has begun with a given right's least attractive practitioners".  Objectivists have also opposed a number of government activities commonly supported by both liberals and conservatives, including antitrust laws,  the minimum wage, public education,  and existing child labor laws.  Objectivists have argued against faith-based initiatives,  displaying religious symbols in government facilities,  and the teaching of "intelligent design" in public schools.  Maintaining that it should be phased out gradually, Rand opposed taxation as she considered it theft and an endorsement of force over reason.  Criticisms on politicsSome critics, including economists and political philosophers such as, Murray Rothbard, David D. Friedman, Roy Childs, Norman P. Barry, and Chandran Kukathas, have argued that Objectivist ethics are consistent with anarcho-capitalism instead of minarchism.Aesthetics: metaphysical value-judgments The Objectivist theory of art flows from its epistemology, by way of "psycho-epistemology" (Rand's term for an individual's characteristic mode of functioning in acquiring knowledge). Art, according to Objectivism, serves a human cognitive need: it allows human beings to grasp concepts as though they were percepts. Objectivism defines "art" as a "selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments"—that is, according to what the artist believes to be ultimately true and important about the nature of reality and humanity. In this respect Objectivism regards art as a way of presenting abstractions concretely, in perceptual form. The human need for art, on this view, stems from the need for cognitive economy. A concept is already a sort of mental shorthand standing for a large number of concretes, allowing a human being to think indirectly or implicitly of many more such concretes than can be held explicitly in mind. But a human being cannot hold indefinitely many concepts explicitly in mind either—and yet, on the Objectivist view, needs a comprehensive conceptual framework to provide guidance in life. Art offers a way out of this dilemma by providing a perceptual, easily grasped means of communicating and thinking about a wide range of abstractions, including one's metaphysical value-judgments. Objectivism regards art as an effective way to communicate a moral or ethical ideal.  Objectivism does not, however, regard art as propagandistic: even though art involves moral values and ideals, its purpose is not to educate, only to show or project. Moreover, art need not be, and usually is not, the outcome of a full-blown, explicit philosophy. Usually it stems from an artist's sense of life (which is preconceptual and largely emotional). Rand held that Romanticism was the highest school of literary art, noting that Romanticism was "based on the recognition of the principle that man possesses the faculty of volition," absent which, Rand believed, literature is robbed of dramatic power, adding: The term "romanticism," however, is often affiliated with emotionalism, to which Objectivism is completely opposed. Historically, many romantic artists were philosophically subjectivist. Most Objectivists who are also artists subscribe to what they call romantic realism, which is how Rand labeled her own work. Development by other authors  Several authors have developed and applied Rand's ideas in their own work. Rand described Peikoff's The Ominous Parallels (1982), as "the first book by an Objectivist philosopher other than myself."  In 1991, Peikoff published Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand, a comprehensive exposition of Rand's philosophy.  Chris Matthew Sciabarra discusses Rand's ideas and theorizes about their intellectual origins in Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical (1995). Surveys such as On Ayn Rand by Allan Gotthelf (1999), Ayn Rand by Tibor R. Machan (2000), and Objectivism in One Lesson by Andrew Bernstein (2009) provide briefer introductions to Rand's ideas.Some scholars have focused on applying Objectivism in more specific areas. Machan has developed Rand's contextual conception of human knowledge (while also drawing on the insights of J. L. Austin and Gilbert Harman) in works such as Objectivity (2004), and David Kelley has explicated Rand's epistemological ideas in works such as The Evidence of the Senses (1986) and A Theory of Abstraction (2001). In the field of ethics, Kelley has argued in works such as Unrugged Individualism (1996) and The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand (2000) that Objectivists should pay more attention to the virtue of benevolence and place less emphasis on issues of moral sanction. Kelley's views have been controversial, and critics Peikoff and Peter Schwartz have argued that he contradicts important principles of Objectivism.  Kelley has used the term "Open Objectivism" for a version of Objectivism that involves "a commitment to reasoned, non-dogmatic discussion and debate," "the recognition that Objectivism is open to expansion, refinement, and revision," and "a policy of benevolence toward others, including fellow-travelers and critics." An author who focuses on Rand's ethics, Tara Smith, stays closer to Rand's original ideas in such works as Moral Rights and Political Freedom (1995), Viable Values (2000), and Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics (2006).  In collaboration with Peikoff, David Harriman has developed a theory of scientific induction based upon Rand's theory of concepts in The Logical Leap: Induction in Physics (2010). The political aspects of Rand's philosophy are discussed by Bernstein in The Capitalist Manifesto (2005). In Capitalism: A Treatise on Economics (1996), George Reisman attempts to integrate Objectivist methodology and insights with both Classical and Austrian economics. In psychology, Professor Edwin A. Locke and Ellen Kenner have explored Rand's ideas in The Selfish Path to Romance: How to Love with Passion & Reason.  Other writers have explored the application of Objectivism to fields ranging from art, as in What Art Is by Louis Torres and Michelle Marder Kamhi (2000), to teleology, as in The Biological Basis of Teleological Concepts by Harry Binswanger (1990).Intellectual impactAccording to one Rand biographer, most people first read Rand's works in their "formative years."  Rand's former protégé Nathaniel Branden referred to Rand's "especially powerful appeal to the young,"  while Onkar Ghate of the Ayn Rand Institute said Rand "appeals to the idealism of youth."    This appeal has alarmed a number of critics of the philosophy.  Many of these young people later abandon their positive view of Rand and are often said to have "outgrown" her ideas.    Supporters of Rand's work recognize the phenomenon, but attribute it to the loss of youthful idealism and inability to resist social pressures for intellectual conformity.   In contrast, historian Jennifer Burns, writing in Goddess of the Market (2009), says some critics "dismiss Rand as a shallow thinker appealing only to adolescents," although she thinks the critics "miss her significance" as a "gateway drug" to right-wing politics. Academic philosophers have generally dismissed Objectivism since Rand first presented it.  Objectivism has been called "fiercely anti-academic" because of Rand's criticism of contemporary intellectuals.  David Sidorsky, a professor of moral and political philosophy at Columbia University, says Rand's work is "outside the mainstream" and is more of an ideological movement than a well-grounded philosophy.  British philosopher Ted Honderich notes that he deliberately excluded an article on Rand from The Oxford Companion to Philosophy (Rand is, however, mentioned in the article on popular philosophy by Anthony Quinton).  Rand is the subject of entries in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy,  The Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers,    the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy,  The Routledge Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Political Thinkers,  and The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy.  A listing of Rand also appears in the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, featuring the assessment, "The influence of Rand's ideas was strongest among college students in the USA but attracted little attention from academic philosophers. Her outspoken defense of capitalism in works like Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal (1967), and her characterization of her position as a defence of the 'virtue of selfishness' in her essay collection of the same title published in 1964, also brought notoriety, but kept her out of the intellectual mainstream."   In recent decades Rand's works are more likely to be encountered in the classroom.  The Ayn Rand Society, dedicated to fostering the scholarly study of Objectivism, is affiliated with the American Philosophical Association's Eastern Division.  Aristotle scholar and Objectivist Allan Gotthelf, late chairman of the Society, and his colleagues argued for more academic study of Objectivism, viewing the philosophy as a unique and intellectually interesting defense of classical liberalism that is worth debating.  In 1999 a refereed Journal of Ayn Rand Studies began.  In 2006 the University of Pittsburgh held a conference focusing on Objectivism.  Programs and fellowships for the study of Objectivism have been supported at the University of Pittsburgh, University of Texas at Austin and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Oath of office<====>22258<====>Oath of officeAn oath of office is an oath or affirmation a person takes before undertaking the duties of an office, usually a position in government or within a religious body, although such oaths are sometimes required of officers of other organizations.  Such oaths are often required by the laws of the state, religious body, or other organization before the person may actually exercise the powers of the office or any religious body.  It may be administered at an inauguration, coronation, enthronement, or other ceremony connected with the taking up of office itself, or it may be administered privately. 

Ontology<====>22261<====>Ontology   Ontology is the philosophical   of the nature of being, becoming, existence, or reality, as well as the basic categories of being and their relations.   Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics, ontology often deals with questions concerning what entities exist or may be said to exist and how such entities may be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to similarities and differences.  A very simple definition of ontology is that it is the examination of what is meant, in context, by the word 'thing'. 

Ordovician<====>22265<====>Ordovician The Ordovician ( ) is a geologic period and system, the second of six periods of the Paleozoic Era.  The Ordovician spans 41. 2 million years from the end of the Cambrian Period   million years ago (Mya) to the start of the Silurian Period   Mya.    The Ordovician, named after the Celtic tribe of the Ordovices, was defined by Charles Lapworth in 1879 to resolve a dispute between followers of Adam Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison, who were placing the same rock beds in northern Wales into the Cambrian and Silurian systems, respectively. 

Oregano<====>22266<====>Oregano  Oregano (  or  ;;    Origanum vulgare) is a flowering plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae).  It is native to temperate Western and Southwestern Eurasia and the Mediterranean region. Oregano is a perennial herb, growing from   tall, with opposite leaves   long.  The flowers are purple,   long, produced in erect spikes.  It is sometimes called wild marjoram, and its close relative, O.  majorana, is known as sweet marjoram. EtymologyThe word oregano is derived from Spanish orégano, from Latin orīganum, from Greek ὀρίγανον (orī́ganon). 

Off topic<====>22270<====>Off topic In the context of mailing lists, discussion groups, discussion forums, bulletin boards,  newsgroups, and wikis a contribution is off-topic if it is not within the bounds of the current discussion, and on-topic if it is. Even on very specialized forums and lists, off-topic posting is not necessarily frowned upon,  but a common netiquette convention is to mark a new off-topic posting or email by beginning it with "OT"  - for example in a forum discussing the Linux operating system someone might post: "OT: Wow, did you feel that earthquake?".

Oligocene<====>22286<====>Oligocene  The Oligocene ( ) is a geologic epoch of the Paleogene Period and extends from about 33. 9 million to 23 million years before the present (  to  ).  As with other older geologic periods, the rock beds that define the epoch are well identified but the exact dates of the start and end of the epoch are slightly uncertain.  The name Oligocene comes from the Ancient Greek   (olígos, "few") and   (kainós, "new"),    and refers to the sparsity of extant forms of molluscs.  The Oligocene is preceded by the Eocene Epoch and is followed by the Miocene Epoch. 

Ozymandias<====>22288<====>Ozymandias   "Ozymandias" ( ,  )  is a sonnet written by English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822), first published in the 11 January 1818 issue of The Examiner   in London.

Occitan language<====>22292<====>Occitan language Occitan ( ;    ;   ), also known as lenga d'òc ( ;  ) by its native speakers, is a Romance language.  It is spoken in southern France, Italy's Occitan Valleys, Monaco, and Spain's Val d'Aran; collectively, these regions are sometimes referred to as Occitania.  Occitan is also spoken in the linguistic enclave of Guardia Piemontese (Calabria, Italy).  However, there is controversy about the unity of the language, as some think that Occitan is a macrolanguage.   Others include Catalan in this family, as the distance between this language and some Occitan dialects (such as the Gascon language) is similar to the distance among different Occitan dialects. 

Old Turkic alphabet<====>22293<====>Old Turkic alphabet   The Old Turkic script (also known as variously Göktürk script, Orkhon script, Orkhon-Yenisey script) is the alphabet used by the Göktürks and other early Turkic khanates during the 8th to 10th centuries to record the Old Turkic language.  The script is named after the Orkhon Valley in Mongolia where early 8th-century inscriptions were discovered in an 1889 expedition by Nikolai Yadrintsev.These Orkhon inscriptions were published by Vasily Radlov and deciphered by the Danish philologist Vilhelm Thomsen in 1893. This writing system was later used within the Uyghur Khaganate.  Additionally, a Yenisei variant is known from 9th-century Yenisei Kirghiz inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the Talas Valley of Turkestan and the Old Hungarian alphabet of the 10th century.

Oxygen<====>22303<====>Oxygen    Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8.  It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and an oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds.   By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium.   At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula  .  Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20. 8% of the Earth's atmosphere. 

Osmium<====>22304<====>Osmium  Osmium (from Greek ὀσμή osme, "smell") is a chemical element with symbol Os and atomic number 76.  It is a hard, brittle, bluish-white transition metal in the platinum group that is found as a trace element in alloys, mostly in platinum ores.  Osmium is the densest naturally occurring element, with a density of  .  Its alloys with platinum, iridium, and other platinum-group metals are employed in fountain pen nib tipping, electrical contacts, and other applications where extreme durability and hardness are needed.  CharacteristicsPhysical propertiesOsmium has a blue-gray tint and is the densest stable element, approximately twice the density of lead  and slightly denser than iridium. 

Oxide<====>22305<====>OxideAn oxide   is a chemical compound that contains at least one oxygen atom and one other element  in its chemical formula.  "Oxide" itself is the dianion of oxygen, an O 2–  atom.  Metal oxides thus typically contain an anion of oxygen in the oxidation state of −2.  Most of the Earth's crust consists of  solid oxides, the result of elements being oxidized by the oxygen in air or in water.   Hydrocarbon combustion affords the two principal carbon oxides: carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.   Even materials considered pure elements often develop an oxide coating. 

Overgrazing<====>22306<====>Overgrazing Overgrazing occurs when plants are exposed to intensive grazing for extended periods of time, or without sufficient recovery periods.  It can be caused by either livestock in poorly managed agricultural applications, game reserves, or nature reserves.  It can also be caused by immobile, travel restricted populations of native or non-native wild animals.  Cows are the main things that causes overgrazing and "overgrazing".  However, "overgrazing" is a controversial concept, based on equilibrium system theory.  It reduces the usefulness, productivity, and biodiversity of the land and is one cause of desertification and erosion.  Overgrazing is also seen as a cause of the spread of invasive species of non-native plants and of weeds. 

Oxford<====>22308<====>Oxford   {{Infobox settlement }}Oxford ( )   is a city in the South East region of England and the county town of Oxfordshire.

Outing<====>22310<====>Outing  Outing is the act of disclosing an LGBT person's sexual orientation or gender identity without that person's consent.  Outing gives rise to issues of privacy, choice, hypocrisy, and harm in addition to sparking debate on what constitutes common good in efforts to combat homophobia and heterosexism.  A publicized outing targets prominent figures in a society, for example well-known politicians, accomplished athletes or popular artists.  Opponents to LGBT rights movements as well as activists within LGBT communities have used this type of outing as a controversial political campaign or tactic.  In an attempt to pre-empt being outed, an LGBT public figure may decide to come out publicly first, although controlling the conditions under which one's LGBT identity is revealed is only one of numerous motives for coming out. 

Oakland Raiders<====>22312<====>Oakland Raiders  The Oakland Raiders  are a professional American football franchise based in Oakland, California.

The Raiders' off-field fortunes have varied considerably over the years.  The team's first three years of operation (1960–1962) were marred by poor on-field performance, financial difficulties, and spotty attendance. 

O<====>22314<====>O   O (named o  , plural oes)  is the 15th letter and the fourth vowel in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet.  It is used in words such as opulent and orangutan, as well as names such as Ophelia and Oprah.  HistoryIts graphic form has remained fairly constant from Phoenician times until today.  The name of the Phoenician letter was ʿeyn, meaning "eye", and indeed its shape originates simply as a drawing of a human eye (possibly inspired by the corresponding Egyptian hieroglyph, cf.  Proto-Sinaitic script). Its original sound value was that of a consonant,  probably  , the sound represented by the cognate  Arabic letter ع ʿayn. 

Oligarchy<====>22315<====>Oligarchy  Oligarchy ( ;  )    is a form of power structure in which power rests with a small number of people.  These people might be distinguished by nobility, wealth, family ties, education or corporate, religious or military control.  Such states are often controlled by families who typically pass their influence from one generation to the next, but inheritance is not a necessary condition for the application of this term. Throughout history, oligarchies have often been tyrannical, relying on public obedience or oppression to exist.  Aristotle pioneered the use of the term as a synonym for rule by the rich,  for which another term commonly used today is plutocracy.

Ordered pair<====>22362<====>Ordered pairIn mathematics, an ordered pair (a, b) is a pair of objects.  The order in which the objects appear in the pair is significant: the ordered pair (a, b) is different from the ordered pair (b, a) unless a = b.   (In contrast, the unordered pair {a, b} equals the unordered pair {b, a}. )Ordered pairs are also called 2-tuples, or sequences (sometimes, lists in a computer science context) of length 2; ordered pairs of scalars are also called 2-dimensional vectors. The entries of an ordered pair can be other ordered pairs, enabling the recursive definition of ordered n-tuples (ordered lists of n objects).

October 10<====>22367<====>October 10Events680 – Battle of Karbala: Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, is decapitated by forces under Caliph Yazid I.  This is commemorated by Muslims as Aashurah. 732 – Battle of Tours: A force commanded by Charles Martel defeats an army of the Umayyad Caliphate between Poitiers and Tours in western France. 1471 – Sten Sture the Elder, the Regent of Sweden, with the help of farmers and miners, repels an attack by King Christian I of Denmark. 1575 – Roman Catholic forces under Henry I, Duke of Guise defeat the Protestants, capturing Philippe de Mornay among others. 

Old Catholic Church<====>22370<====>Old Catholic Church    The term Old Catholic Church was originally used from the 1850s by groups which had separated from the Roman Catholic Church over certain doctrines, primarily concerned with papal authority.  These churches are not in full communion with the Roman Catholic Church.   Member churches of the Union of Utrecht of the Old Catholic Churches (UU) are in full communion with the Anglican Communion,  and some are members of the World Council of Churches.  The formation of the Old Catholic communion of Germans, Austrians and Swiss began in 1870 at a public meeting held in Nuremberg under the leadership of Ignaz von Döllinger, following the First Vatican Council. 

Oliver Lieb<====>22371<====>Oliver Lieb  Oliver Lieb (born 1969 in Frankfurt, Germany) is a German electronic music producer and DJ.  Lieb is known to have more than a dozen aliases with over 200 productions and remixes in various electronic genres such as trance, house, and techno.   He has also produced tracks for other artists. CareerLieb began his musical career at the age of fourteen, as a bassist, playing in funk and soul bands.  However, he often left the bands he played in before they found any real success.  Eventually he started exploring electronic music. His first record, under the alias 'Force Legato', was released by ZYX Music. 

Object code<====>22373<====>Object code   In computing object code, or sometimes an object module, is what a compiler produces.   In a general sense object code is a sequence of statements or instructions in a computer language,  usually a machine code language (i. e. , binary) or an intermediate language such as register transfer language (RTL). DetailsObject files can in turn be linked to form an executable file or library file.  In order to be used, object code must either be placed in an executable file, a library file, or an object file. Object code is a portion of machine code that has not yet been linked into a complete program. 

Oort cloud<====>22385<====>Oort cloud   The Oort cloud ( ),  named after the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, sometimes called the Öpik–Oort cloud,  is a theoretical cloud of predominantly icy planetesimals proposed to surround the Sun to as far as somewhere between  .  The Oort cloud's outer limit is difficult to define as it varies over the millennia as different stars pass the Sun and thus is subject to variation.  Estimates of its distance range from 50,000 to 200,000 AU.    It is divided into two regions: a disc-shaped inner Oort cloud (or Hills cloud) and a spherical outer Oort cloud. 

Ohio River<====>22388<====>Ohio River   The Ohio River, which streams westward from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Cairo, Illinois, is the largest tributary, by volume, of the Mississippi River in the United States.  At the confluence, the Ohio is considerably bigger than the Mississippi (Ohio at Cairo: 281,500 cu ft/s (7,960 m 3 /s);  Mississippi at Thebes: 208,200 cu ft/s (5,897 m 3 /s) ) and, thus, is hydrologically the main stream of the whole river system. The   river flows through or along the border of six states, and its drainage basin includes parts of 15 states.   Through its largest tributary, the Tennessee River, the basin includes many of the states of the southeastern U. 

Oland (Frisian island)<====>22391<====>Oland (Frisian island)Oland ( , North Frisian: Ualöönist) is a small hallig which is connected by a narrow gauge railway to the mainland and to hallig Langeneß.Germany's smallest lighthouse is located here, being also the only one with a thatched roof.

Organelle<====>22393<====>Organelle In cell biology, an organelle ( ) is a specialized subunit within a cell that has a specific function.  Individual organelles are usually separately enclosed within their own lipid bilayers. The name organelle comes from the idea that these structures are parts of cells, as organs are to the body, hence organelle, the suffix -elle being a diminutive.  Organelles are identified by microscopy, and can also be purified by cell fractionation.  There are many types of organelles, particularly in eukaryotic cells.  While prokaryotes do not possess organelles per se, some do contain protein-based bacterial microcompartments, which are thought to act as primitive organelles. 

Ouida<====>22400<====>OuidaOuida ( ; 1 January 1839  – 25 January 1908) was the pseudonym of the English novelist Maria Louise Ramé (although she preferred to be known as Marie Louise de la Ramée). Life and careerMaria Louise Ramé was born at Bury St Edmunds, England.  "Maria Louise Ramé", birth record, Bury St.  Edmunds, FreeBMD, accessed 3 July 2012.  Note: Does not include any information about parents.   Her mother, Susan Sutton, was a wine merchant's daughter;  her father was from France.    She derived her pen name from her own childish pronunciation of her given name "Louise".

OS/2<====>22409<====>OS/2  OS/2 is a series of computer operating systems, initially created by Microsoft and IBM under the leadership of IBM software designer Ed Iacobucci, who later went on to found Citrix Systems, DayJet and VirtualWorks.   As a result of a feud between the two companies over how to position OS/2 relative to Microsoft's new Windows 3. 1 operating environment,  the two companies severed the relationship in 1992 and OS/2 development fell to IBM exclusively.   The name stands for "Operating System/2", because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's "Personal System/2 (PS/2)" line of second-generation personal computers. 

Organization of Asia-Pacific News Agencies<====>22412<====>Organization of Asia-Pacific News AgenciesThe Organization of Asia-Pacific News Agencies (OANA) is an association of news agencies from UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) member states in the Asia-Pacific region. It was previously known as the Organisation of Asian News Agencies.It was formed in 1961 on UNESCO’s initiative. It provides a news wire service containing articles donated by its members.MembersThe members of OANA are:  Name  Country Bakhtar News Agency  Afghanistan Australian Associated Press  Australia Azerbaijan State Telegraph Agency  Azerbaijan Trend News Agency  Azerbaijan Bahrain News Agency  Bahrain Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha  Bangladesh United News of Bangladesh  Bangladesh Agence Khmer de Presse  Cambodia Xinhua News Agency  China Korean Central News Agency  North Korea Emirates News Agency  Emirates Press Trust of India  India Asian News International  India Antara  Indonesia Islamic Republic News Agency  Iran mosbatemardom  Iran Mehr News Agency  Iran Fars News Agency  Iran National Iraqi News Agency  Iraq Jiji Press  Japan Kyodo News  Japan Kazinform  Kazakhstan Khabar Agency  Kazakhstan Kuwait News Agency  Kuwait Kabar  Kyrgyzstan Lao News Agency  Laos Bernama  Malaysia Montsame News Agency  Mongolia Rastriya Samachar Samati  Nepal Oman News Agency  Oman Pakistan Press International  Pakistan Associated Press of Pakistan  Pakistan Philippine News Agency  Philippines Qatar News Agency  Qatar Yonhap News Agency  South Korea ITAR-TASS News Agency  Russia Russian Information Agency  Russia Saudi Press Agency  Saudi Arabia Lankapuvath  Sri Lanka Syrian Arab News Agency  Syria Thai News Agency  Thailand Anadolu News Agency  Turkey Vietnam News Agency  Vietnam Yemen News Agency  Yemen See also Asia-PacificJournalismReferences External links  

Oliver Cromwell<====>22413<====>Oliver CromwellOliver Cromwell (25 April 1599 3 September 1658)  was an English military and political leader.  He served as Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 1653 until his death. Cromwell was born into the middle gentry, albeit to a family descended from the sister of King Henry VIII's minister Thomas Cromwell.  Little is known of the first 40 years of his life as only four of his personal letters survive alongside a summary of a speech he delivered in 1628.   He became an Independent Puritan after undergoing a religious conversion in the 1630s, taking a generally tolerant view towards the many Protestant sects of his period. 

Otto von Bismarck<====>22416<====>Otto von Bismarck    Otto Eduard Leopold, Prince of Bismarck, Duke of Lauenburg (1 April 1815 – 30 July 1898), known as Otto von Bismarck ( ), was a conservative Prussian statesman who dominated German and European affairs from the 1860s until 1890 and was the first Chancellor of the German Empire between 1871 and 1890.  In 1862, King Wilhelm I appointed Bismarck as Minister President of Prussia, a position he would hold until 1890, with the exception of a short break in 1873.  He provoked three short, decisive wars against Denmark, Austria, and France.  Following the win against Austria, he abolished the supranational German Confederation and instead formed the North German Confederation as the first German national state in 1867, leading it as Federal Chancellor.

Olney Hymns<====>22422<====>Olney Hymns The Olney Hymns   were first published in February 1779 and are the combined work of curate John Newton (1725–1807) and his poet friend, William Cowper (1731–1800).  The hymns were written for use in Newton's rural parish, which was made up of relatively poor and uneducated followers.  The Olney Hymns are an illustration of the potent ideologies of the Evangelical movement, to which both men belonged, present in many communities in England at the time. The Olney Hymns were very popular; by 1836 there had been 37 recorded editions, and it is likely that many other editions were printed in both Britain and America. 

Recapitulation theory<====>22424<====>Recapitulation theory  The theory of recapitulation, also called the biogenetic law or embryological parallelism—often expressed using Ernst Haeckel's phrase  "ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"—is a historical hypothesis that the development of the embryo of an animal, from fertilization to gestation or hatching (ontogeny), goes through stages resembling or representing successive stages in the evolution of the animal's remote ancestors (phylogeny).  It was formulated in the 1820s by  Étienne Serres  based on the work of Johann Friedrich Meckel, after whom it is also known as  Meckel-Serres law. Since embryos also evolve in different ways, the shortcomings of the theory had been recognized by the early 20th century, and it had been relegated to "biological mythology" Ehrlich, Paul; Richard Holm; Dennis Parnell (1963) The Process of Evolution. 

Ostrogoths<====>22428<====>OstrogothsThe Ostrogoths ( ;  ;  ) were the eastern branch of the later Goths (the other major branch being the Visigoths).  The Ostrogoths traced their origins to the Greutungi – a branch of the Goths who had migrated southward from the Baltic Sea and established a kingdom north of the Black Sea, during the 3rd and 4th centuries.  They built an empire stretching from the Black Sea to the Baltic.  The Ostrogoths were probably literate in the 3rd century, and their trade with the Romans was highly developed.  Their Danubian kingdom reached its zenith under King Ermanaric, who is said to have committed suicide at an old age when the Huns attacked his people and subjugated them in about 370. 

Ordered field<====>22430<====>Ordered fieldIn mathematics, an ordered field is a field together with a total ordering of its elements that is compatible with the field operations.  Historically, the axiomatization of an ordered field was abstracted gradually from the real numbers, by mathematicians including David Hilbert, Otto Hölder and Hans Hahn.  This grew eventually into the Artin–Schreier theory of ordered fields and formally real fields. An ordered field necessarily has characteristic 0 since the elements   necessarily are all distinct.   Thus, an ordered field necessarily contains an infinite number of elements: a finite field cannot be ordered. Every subfield of an ordered field is also an ordered field in the inherited order. 

Oracle machine<====>22431<====>Oracle machine  In complexity theory and computability theory, an oracle machine is an abstract machine used to study decision problems.  It can be visualized as a Turing machine with a black box, called an oracle, which is able to solve certain decision problems in a single operation.  The problem can be of any complexity class.  Even undecidable problems, such as the halting problem, can be used. OraclesAn oracle machine can be conceived as a Turing machine connected to an oracle.  The oracle, in this context, is an entity capable of solving some problem, which for example may be a decision problem or a function problem. 

Orangutan<====>22433<====>OrangutanThe orangutans (also spelled orang-utan, orangutang, or orang-utang)  are three extant species of great apes native to Indonesia and Malaysia.  Orangutans are currently only found in the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra.  Classified in the genus Pongo, orangutans were originally considered to be one species.  From 1996, they were divided into two species: the Bornean orangutan (P.  pygmaeus, with three subspecies) and the Sumatran orangutan (P.  abelii).  In November 2017 it was reported that a third species had been identified, the Tapanuli orangutan (P.  tapanuliensis).Genomic comparisons show that the Tapanuli orangutan separated from the Sumatran orangutan about 3.

The Old English poem Widsith (9th century) refers briefly to his victorious single combat, a story which is related at length by the 12th-century Danish historians Saxo and  Sven Aggesen. 

Orbital resonance<====>22444<====>Orbital resonance In celestial mechanics, an orbital resonance occurs when  orbiting bodies exert a regular, periodic gravitational influence on each other, usually because their orbital periods are related by a ratio of small integers.  Most commonly this relationship is found for a pair of objects.  The physics principle behind orbital resonance is similar in concept to pushing a child on a swing, where the orbit and the swing both have a natural frequency, and the other body doing the "pushing" will act in periodic repetition to have a cumulative effect on the motion.  Orbital resonances greatly enhance the mutual gravitational influence of the bodies, i.

Open-wheel car<====>22450<====>Open-wheel car   An open-wheel car (formula car, or often single-seater car in British English) is a car with the wheels outside the car's main body, and usually having only one seat.  Open-wheel cars contrast with street cars, sports cars, stock cars, and touring cars, which have their wheels below the body or inside fenders.  Open-wheel cars are usually built specifically for racing, frequently with a higher degree of technological sophistication than in other forms of motor sport.  Open-wheel street cars, such as the Ariel Atom, are very scarce as they are often impractical for everyday use. 

Offshore powerboat racing<====>22451<====>Offshore powerboat racing  Offshore powerboat racing is a type of racing by ocean-going powerboats, typically point-to-point racing. In most of the world, offshore powerboat racing is led by the Union Internationale Motonautique (UIM) regulated Class 1 and Powerboat GPS (formerly known as Powerboat P1).   In the USA, offshore powerboat racing is led by the APBA/UIM and consists of races hosted by OPA Racing, OSS, and P1. The sport is financed by a mixture of private funding and commercial sponsors.  History of the sportIn 1903, the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland, and its offshoot, the Marine Motor Association organised a race of auto-boats. 

Ogden Nash<====>22452<====>Ogden Nash Frederic Ogden Nash (August 19, 1902 – May 19, 1971) was an American poet well known for his light verse, of which he wrote over 500 pieces.

Octahedron<====>22458<====>Octahedron  In geometry, an octahedron (plural: octahedra) is a polyhedron with eight faces, twelve edges, and six vertices.   The term is most commonly used to refer to the regular octahedron, a Platonic solid composed of eight equilateral triangles, four of which meet at each  .  A regular octahedron is the dual polyhedron of a cube.  It is a rectified tetrahedron.  It is a square bipyramid in any of three orthogonal orientations.  It is also a triangular antiprism in any of four orientations. An octahedron is the three-dimensional case of the more general concept of a cross polytope. 

Ole Rømer<====>22459<====>Ole Rømer  Ole Christensen Rømer ( ; 25 September 1644 – 19 September 1710) was a Danish astronomer who in 1676 made the first quantitative measurements of the speed of light. Rømer also invented the modern thermometer showing the temperature between two fixed points, namely the points at which water respectively boils and freezes. In scientific literature alternative spellings such as "Roemer", "Römer", or "Romer" are common. BiographyRømer was born on 25 September 1644 in Århus to a merchant and skipper, Christen Pedersen (died 1663), and Anna Olufsdatter Storm (  – 1690), daughter of a well-to-do alderman.Since 1642, Christen Pedersen had taken to using the name Rømer, which means that he was from the Danish island of Rømø, to distinguish himself from a couple of other people named Christen Pedersen. 

Othello<====>22460<====>Othello    Othello (The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written in 1603.  It is based on the story Un Capitano Moro ("A Moorish Captain") by Cinthio, a disciple of Boccaccio, first published in 1565.   The story revolves around its two central characters: Othello, a Moorish general in the Venetian army and his unfaithful ensign, Iago.  Given its varied and enduring themes of racism, love, jealousy, betrayal, revenge and repentance, Othello is still often performed in professional and community theatre alike, and has been the source for numerous operatic, film, and literary adaptations. 

Osteoporosis<====>22461<====>Osteoporosis  Osteoporosis is a disease where increased bone weakness increases the risk of a broken bone.   It is the most common reason for a broken bone among the elderly.Bones that commonly break include the vertebrae in the spine, the bones of the forearm, and the hip.Until a broken bone occurs there are typically no symptoms.   Bones may weaken to such a degree that a break may occur with minor stress or spontaneously.   Chronic pain and a decreased ability to carry out normal activities may occur following a broken bone.

The office was established by the UN General Assembly on 20 December 1993  in the wake of the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights. The office is headed by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, who co-ordinates human rights activities throughout the UN System and supervises the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland. 

Oklahoma City bombing<====>22467<====>Oklahoma City bombing  The Oklahoma City bombing was a domestic terrorist truck bombing on the Alfred P.  Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States on April 19, 1995.  Perpetrated by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, the bombing killed 168 people,  injured more than 680 others, and destroyed one-third of the building.    Shariat et al.  count only 167 killed "as a direct result of the bombing or during escape".  They did not include Rebecca Needham Anderson, who – having seen the bombing on TV in Midwest City, Oklahoma – came to the rescue and was killed by a piece of falling debris.

Ontogeny<====>22469<====>Ontogeny Ontogeny (also ontogenesis or morphogenesis) is the origination and development of an organism, usually from the time of fertilization of the egg to the organism's mature form—although the term can be used to refer to the study of the entirety of an organism's lifespan. Ontogeny is the developmental history of an organism within its own lifetime, as distinct from phylogeny, which refers to the evolutionary history of a species.  In practice, writers on evolution often speak of species as "developing" traits or characteristics.  This can be misleading.  While developmental (i. e. , ontogenetic) processes can influence subsequent evolutionary (e. 

Ophiuchus<====>22472<====>Ophiuchus   Ophiuchus   is a large constellation located around the celestial equator.

Octans<====>22475<====>Octans Octans   is a faint constellation located in the deep southern sky.  Its name is Latin for the eighth part of a circle, but it is named after the octant, a navigational instrument.  The constellation was devised by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1752, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. History and mythologyOctans was one of 14 constellations created by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope, and was originally named "l’Octans de Reflexion", French for “the reflecting octant”.  It was part of his catalogue of the southern sky, the Coelum Australe Stelliferum, which was published posthumously in 1763. 

Okinawa Prefecture<====>22477<====>Okinawa Prefectureis the southernmost prefecture of Japan.   It encompasses two thirds of the Ryukyu Islands in a chain over   long.  The Ryukyu Islands extend southwest from Kyushu (the southwesternmost of Japan's four main islands) to Taiwan.  Naha, Okinawa's capital, is located in the southern part of Okinawa Island.  Although Okinawa comprises just 0. 6 percent of Japan's total land mass, about 75 percent of all U. S.  military personnel stationed in Japan are assigned to installations in Okinawa.   Currently about 26,000 U. S.  troops are based in the prefecture. 

Olive oil<====>22478<====>Olive oil    Olive oil is a liquid fat obtained from olives (the fruit of Olea europaea; family Oleaceae), a traditional tree crop of the Mediterranean Basin.  The oil is produced by pressing whole olives.  It is commonly used in cooking, whether for frying or as a salad dressing.  It is also used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and soaps, and as a fuel for traditional oil lamps, and has additional uses in some religions.  There is limited evidence of its possible health benefits.  The olive is one of three core food plants in Mediterranean cuisine; the other two are wheat and grapes. 

Olive<====>22479<====>Olive    The olive, known by the botanical name Olea europaea, meaning "European olive", is a species of small tree in the family Oleaceae, found in the Mediterranean Basin from Portugal to the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula, and southern Asia as far east as China, as well as the Canary Islands and Réunion.  The species is cultivated in many places and considered naturalized in all the countries of the Mediterranean coast, as well as in Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Java, Norfolk Island, California, and Bermuda.   Olea europeana sylvestris Olea sylvestris Mill.  — The Plant List   is a subspecies that corresponds to a smaller tree bearing noticeably smaller fruit. 

Otho<====>22481<====>Otho   Otho ( ;  ; Classical Latin spelling and reconstructed Classical Latin pronunciation:28 April 32  – 16 April 69) was Roman emperor for three months, from 15 January to 16 April 69.  He was the second emperor of the Year of the Four Emperors. A member of a noble Etruscan family, Otho was initially a friend and courtier of the young emperor Nero until he was effectively banished to the governorship of the remote province of Lusitania in 58 AD following his wife's affair with Nero.  After a period of moderate rule in the province, he allied himself with Galba, the governor of neighbouring Hispania Tarraconensis, during the revolts of 68 AD. 

Orsini family<====>22482<====>Orsini family   The Orsini family is an Italian noble family; it was one of the most influential princely families in medieval Italy and renaissance Rome.  Members of the Orsini include three popes: Celestine III (1191–1198), Nicholas III (1277–1280),  and Benedict XIII (1724–1730).   In addition, the family membership includes 34 cardinals, numerous condottieri, and other significant political and religious figures. OriginsAccording to their family legend, the Orsini are descended from the Julio-Claudian family of ancient Rome.  This is fanciful, as is the alleged connection to the German families of Anhalt, Baden and Bohemian Rosenberg sporting the same name. 

Optics<====>22483<====>Optics Optics is the branch of physics which involves the behaviour and properties of light, including its interactions with matter and the construction of instruments that use or detect it.Optics usually describes the behaviour of visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light.  Because light is an electromagnetic wave, other forms of electromagnetic radiation such as X-rays, microwaves, and radio waves exhibit similar properties.  Most optical phenomena can be accounted for using the classical electromagnetic description of light.  Complete electromagnetic descriptions of light are, however, often difficult to apply in practice.  Practical optics is usually done using simplified models.

Olbers' paradox<====>22486<====>Olbers' paradoxIn astrophysics and physical cosmology, Olbers' paradox, named after the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers (1758–1840), also known as the "dark night sky paradox", is the argument that the darkness of the night sky conflicts with the assumption of an infinite and eternal static universe.  The darkness of the night sky is one of the pieces of evidence for a dynamic universe, such as the Big Bang model.  In the hypothetical case that the universe is static, homogeneous at a large scale, and populated by an infinite number of stars, then any line of sight from Earth must end at the (very bright) surface of a star and hence the night sky should be completely illuminated and very bright. 

Occult<====>22487<====>Occult   The occult (from the Latin word occultus "clandestine, hidden, secret") is "knowledge of the hidden".   In common English usage, occult refers to "knowledge of the paranormal", as opposed to "knowledge of the measurable",  usually referred to as science.  The term is sometimes taken to mean knowledge that "is meant only for certain people" or that "must be kept hidden", but for most practicing occultists it is simply the study of a deeper spiritual reality that extends beyond pure reason and the physical sciences.   The terms esoteric and arcane can also be used to describe the occult,   in addition to their meanings unrelated to the supernatural. 

Oklahoma<====>22489<====>OklahomaOklahoma ( ;  Pawnee: Uukuhuúwa,  Cayuga: Gahnawiyoˀgeh ) is a state in the South Central region of the United States.   It is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States.  The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words okla and humma, meaning "red people. "  It is also known informally by its nickname, "The Sooner State," in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on land before the official opening date and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which dramatically increased European-American settlement in the Indian Territory. 

Oxbridge<====>22490<====>Oxbridge  Oxbridge is a portmanteau of "Oxford" and "Cambridge"; the two oldest, most prestigious, and consistently most highly-ranked universities in the United Kingdom.  The term is used to refer to them collectively, both in contrast to other British universities and more broadly to describe characteristics reminiscent of University of Oxford and University of Cambridge, often with implications of superior social or intellectual status.  OriginsAlthough both universities were founded more than eight centuries ago, the term Oxbridge is relatively recent.  In William Thackeray's novel Pendennis, published in 1850, the main character attends the fictional Boniface College, Oxbridge. 

Osman I<====>22492<====>Osman I   Osman I or Osman Gazi ( ;  ; died 1323/4),  sometimes transliterated archaically as Othman, was the leader of the Ottoman Turks and the founder of the Ottoman dynasty.  He and the dynasty bearing his name later established and ruled the nascent Ottoman Empire (then known as the Ottoman Beylik or Emirate).  The state, while only a small principality during Osman's lifetime, transformed into a world empire in the centuries after his death.   It existed until shortly after the end of World War I.  Historians commonly mark the end date at the abolition of the sultanate in 1922, or the proclamation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, or the abolition of the caliphate in 1924.

Orbit<====>22498<====>Orbit  In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved trajectory of an object,  such as the trajectory of a planet around a star or a natural satellite around a planet.  Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating trajectory, although it may also refer to a non-repeating trajectory.  To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptic orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse,  as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Current understanding of the mechanics of orbital motion is based on Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which accounts for gravity as due to curvature of spacetime, with orbits following geodesics. 

Off spin<====>22499<====>Off spin  Off spin is a type of finger spin bowling in the sport of cricket.  A bowler who uses this technique is called an off spinner.  Off spinners are right-handed spin bowlers who use their fingers to spin the ball from a right-handed batsman's off side to the leg side (that is, towards the right-handed batsman, or away from a left-handed batsman).   This contrasts with leg spin, in which the ball spins from leg to off and which is bowled with a very different action.A left-handed bowler who bowls with the same action as an off spinner is known as a left-arm orthodox spinner.

Olympic Games<====>22576<====>Olympic Games  The modern Olympic Games or Olympics (  ) are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions.  The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating.   The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart. Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. 

Old Prussian language<====>22577<====>Old Prussian language   Old Prussian (Old Prussian: Prūsiskai Bilā) is an extinct Baltic language once spoken by the Old Prussians, the Baltic peoples of Prussia (not to be confused with the later and much larger German state of the same name), after 1945 northeastern Poland, the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia and southernmost part of Lithuania. The language is called Old Prussian to avoid confusion with the German dialects Low Prussian and High Prussian and the adjective Prussian, which is also often used to relate to the later German state.  Old Prussian began to be written down in the Latin alphabet in about the 13th century, and a small amount of literature in the language survives. 

OSGi<====>22580<====>OSGi  The OSGi Alliance, formerly known as the Open Services Gateway initiative, is an open standards organization founded in March 1999 that originally specified and continues to maintain the OSGi standard. The OSGi specification describes a modular system and a service platform for the Java programming language that implements a complete and dynamic component model, something that does not exist in standalone Java/VM environments.  Applications or components, coming in the form of bundles for deployment, can be remotely installed, started, stopped, updated, and uninstalled without requiring a reboot; management of Java packages/classes is specified in great detail.  Application life cycle management is implemented via APIs that allow for remote downloading of management policies. 

Estrogen<====>22581<====>Estrogen    Estrogen, or oestrogen, is the primary female sex hormone.  It is responsible for the development and regulation of the female reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics.  There are three major endogenous estrogens in women that have estrogenic hormonal activity: estrone, estradiol, and estriol.  The estrane steroid estradiol is the most potent and prevalent  of these. Estrogens are synthesized in all vertebrates    as well as some insects.Their presence in both vertebrates and insects suggests that estrogenic sex hormones have an ancient evolutionary history.  The three major naturally occurring forms of estrogen in women are estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3). 

Roland Octapad<====>22587<====>Roland OctapadRoland Octapad is a range of MIDI electronic drum percussion controllers produced by the Roland Corporation.  Roland Pad-8The first model, introduced in 1985, was the Pad-8.  It was an influential device at that time, allowing drummers and percussionists the opportunity to trigger virtually any MIDI sound source without the need of a full electronic drum set.   It had no internal sound source, and all pads were assignable to one note each.   All pads were on the same MIDI channel. Roland Pad-80The second model, introduced in 1989, was the Pad-80 Octapad II.  Again the Pad-80 was an eight pad MIDI controller that allowed for various types of MIDI sound sources. 

Oswald Spengler<====>22588<====>Oswald Spengler   Oswald Arnold Gottfried Spengler (29 May 1880 – 8 May 1936) was a German historian and philosopher of history whose interests included mathematics, science, and art.  He is best known for his book The Decline of the West (Der Untergang des Abendlandes), published in 1918 and 1922, covering all of world history.  Spengler's model of history postulates that any culture is a superorganism with a limited and predictable lifespan. Spengler predicted that about the year 2000, Western civilization would enter the period of pre‑death emergency whose countering would necessitate Caesarism (  omnipotence of the executive branch of the central government). 

Oracle<====>22589<====>Oracle In classical antiquity, an oracle was a person or agency considered to provide wise and insightful counsel or prophetic predictions or precognition of the future, inspired by the gods.  As such it is a form of divination. DescriptionThe word oracle comes from the Latin verb ōrāre "to speak" and properly refers to the priest or priestess uttering the prediction.  In extended use, oracle may also refer to the site of the oracle, and to the oracular utterances themselves, called khrēsmoi (χρησμοί) in Greek. Oracles were thought to be portals through which the gods spoke directly to people.

Official Monster Raving Loony Party<====>22592<====>Official Monster Raving Loony Party   The Official Monster Raving Loony Party is a political party    established in the United Kingdom in 1983 by the musician David Sutch, better known as "Screaming Lord Sutch, 3rd Earl of Harrow" or simply "Lord Sutch".   It is notable for its deliberately bizarre policies and it effectively exists to satirise British politics, and to offer itself as an alternative for protest voters, especially in constituencies where the party holding the safe seat is unlikely to lose it and everyone else's vote would be quietly wasted. HistoryStarting in 1963, David Sutch, head of Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages, stood in British parliamentary elections under a range of party names, mainly as the National Teenage Party candidate. 

Omega-3 fatty acid<====>22594<====>Omega-3 fatty acid Omega−3 fatty acids—also called ω−3 fatty acids or n−3 fatty acids —are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)  with a double bond (C=C) at the third carbon atom from the end of the carbon chain. The fatty acids have two ends, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) end, which is considered the beginning of the chain, thus "alpha", and the methyl (-CH 3 ) end, which is considered the "tail" of the chain, thus "omega"; the double bond is at omega minus 3 (not dash 3).  One way in which a fatty acid is named is determined by the location of the first double bond, counted from the methyl end, that is, the omega (ω-) or the n- end. 

Ore<====>22595<====>Ore  An ore is a type of rock that contains sufficient minerals with important elements including metals that can be economically extracted from the rock.   The ores are extracted from the earth through mining; they are then refined (often via smelting) to extract the valuable element, or elements. The grade or concentration of an ore mineral, or metal, as well as its form of occurrence, will directly affect the costs associated with mining the ore.  The cost of extraction must thus be weighed against the metal value contained in the rock to determine what ore can be processed and what ore is of too low a grade to be worth mining. 

Optical brightener<====>22600<====>Optical brightenerOptical brighteners, optical brightening agents (OBAs), fluorescent brightening agents (FBAs), or fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs),  are chemical compounds that absorb light in the ultraviolet and violet region (usually 340-370 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum, and re-emit light in the blue region (typically 420-470 nm) by fluorescence.  Fluorescent emission is a short-lived period of light emission by a fluorophore, unlike phosphorescence, which is long-lived.  These additives are often used to enhance the appearance of color of fabric and paper, causing a "whitening" effect; they make intrinsically yellow/orange materials look less so, by compensating the deficit in blue and purple light reflected by the material, with the blue and purple optical emission of the fluorophore. 

Oil painting<====>22605<====>Oil painting   Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments with a medium of drying oil as the binder.  Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil,  poppy seed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil.  The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the oil paint, such as the amount of yellowing or drying time.  Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints.  An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired.  The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. 

Old Glory<====>22609<====>Old Glory Old Glory is a nickname for the flag of the United States.  The original "Old Glory" was a flag owned by the 19th-century American sea captain William Driver (March 17, 1803 – March 3, 1886), who flew the flag during his career at sea and later brought it to Nashville, Tennessee, where he settled.  Driver greatly prized the flag and ensured its safety from the Confederates, who attempted to seize the flag during the American Civil War.  After the war, Driver's daughter and niece feuded over which of them owned the original Old Glory.  In 1922, both flags claimed to be the original "Old Glory" became part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution, where they remain at the National Museum of American History. 

Orlando Letelier<====>22611<====>Orlando Letelier   Marcos Orlando Letelier del Solar (April 13, 1932 – September 21, 1976) was a Chilean economist, Socialist politician and diplomat during the presidency of Salvador Allende.  A refugee from the military dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, Letelier accepted several academic positions in Washington, D. C.  following his exodus from Chile.  In 1976, agents of DINA, the Pinochet regime's secret police, assassinated Letelier in Washington via the use of a car bomb.  These agents had been working in collaboration with members of the Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations, a U. S. -sponsored, anti-Fidel Castro, militant group. 

Oscar Wilde<====>22614<====>Oscar WildeOscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (16 October 1854 30 November 1900) was an Irish poet and playwright.  After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s, he became one of London's most popular playwrights in the early 1890s.  He is best remembered for his epigrams and plays, his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, as well as the circumstances of his imprisonment and early death. Wilde's parents were successful Anglo-Irish intellectuals in Dublin.  Their son became fluent in French and German early in life.  At university, Wilde read Greats; he proved himself to be an outstanding classicist, first at Dublin, then at Oxford. 

Ostracism<====>22615<====>OstracismOstracism ( , ostrakismos) was a procedure under the Athenian democracy in which any citizen could be expelled from the city-state of Athens for ten years.  While some instances clearly expressed popular anger at the citizen, ostracism was often used preemptively.  It was used as a way of neutralizing someone thought to be a threat to the state or potential tyrant.  It has been called an "honourable exile" by scholar P.  J.  Rhodes.   The word "ostracism" continues to be used for various cases of social shunning. ProcedureThe name is derived from the ostraka (singular ostrakon, ὄστρακον), referring to the pottery shards that were used as voting tokens. 

Omega<====>22616<====>Omega    Omega (capital: Ω, lowercase: ω; Greek ωμέγα) is the 24th and last letter of the Greek alphabet.  In the Greek numeric system, it has a value of 800.  The word literally means "great O" (ō mega, mega meaning "great"), as opposed to omicron, which means "little O" (o mikron, micron meaning "little").   In phonetic terms, the Ancient Greek Ω is a long open-mid o  , comparable to the vowel of British English raw.  In Modern Greek, Ω represents the mid  back rounded vowel  , the same sound as omicron.  The letter omega is transcribed ō or simply o. 

Operation Barbarossa<====>22618<====>Operation Barbarossa Operation Barbarossa (German: Unternehmen Barbarossa) was the code name for the Axis powers invasion of the Soviet Union, starting Sunday, 22 June 1941, during World War II.  The operation stemmed from Nazi Germany's ideological aims to conquer the western Soviet Union so that it could be repopulated by Germans, to use Slavs as a slave-labour force for the Axis war-effort, and to seize the oil reserves of the Caucasus and the agricultural resources of Soviet territories.  In the two years leading up to the invasion, Germany and the Soviet Union signed political and economic pacts for strategic purposes. 

Oceania<====>22621<====>OceaniaOceania (  Pronunciation: The New Oxford Dictionary of English (1998)   — p. 1282 "Oceania /ˌəʊsɪˈɑːnɪə, -ʃɪ-/".   or   ) is a geographic region comprising Melanesia, Micronesia, Polynesia and Australasia.   Spanning the eastern and western hemispheres, Oceania covers an area of   and has a population of Expression error: Unrecognised punctuation character: "{" million.  Situated in the southeast of the Asia Pacific region, Oceania is the smallest continental grouping in land area and the second smallest in population after Antarctica. The islands at the geographic extremes of Oceania are Bonin Islands, a politically integral part of Japan; Hawaii, a state of the United States; Clipperton Island, a possession of France; the Juan Fernández Islands, belonging to Chile; the Campbell Islands, belonging to New Zealand; and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, belonging to Australia. 

Combined oral contraceptive pill<====>22623<====>Combined oral contraceptive pill   The combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP), often referred to as the birth control pill or colloquially as "the pill", is a type of birth control that is designed to be taken orally.  It includes a combination of an estrogen (usually ethinylestradiol) and a progestogen (specifically a progestin).  When taken correctly, it works to prevent pregnancy. They were first approved for contraceptive use in the United States in 1960, and are a very popular form of birth control.  They are currently used by more than 100 million women worldwide and by almost 12 million women in the United States. 

Organized crime<====>22625<====>Organized crime  Organized crime is a category of transnational, national, or local groupings of highly centralized enterprises run by criminals who intend to engage in illegal activity, most commonly for money and profit.  Some criminal organizations, such as terrorist groups, are politically motivated.  Sometimes criminal organizations force people to do business with them, such as when a gang extorts money from shopkeepers for so-called "protection".   Gangs may become disciplined enough to be considered organized.  A criminal organization or gang can also be referred to as a mafia, mob, or crime syndicate; the network, subculture and community of criminals may be referred to as the underworld. 

One Foot in the Grave<====>22626<====>One Foot in the GraveOne Foot in the Grave is a British BBC television dark comedy  sitcom series written by David Renwick.  There were six series and seven Christmas specials over an eleven-year period, from early 1990 to late 2000.  The first five series were broadcast between January 1990 and January 1995.  For the next five years, the show appeared only as Christmas specials, followed by one final series in 2000. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his long-suffering wife, Margaret, played by Annette Crosbie. 

Ottoman Turks<====>22629<====>Ottoman Turks   The Ottoman Turks  (or Osmanlı Turks,  ) were the Turkish-speaking population of the Ottoman Empire who formed the base of the state's military and ruling classes.  Reliable information about the early history of Ottoman Turks is scarce, but they take their Turkish name, Osmanlı ("Osman" being corrupted in some European languages as "Ottoman"), from the house of Osman I (reigned ca.  1299–1326), the founder of the dynasty that ruled the Ottoman Empire for its entire 624 years.  After the expansion from its home in Bithynia, the Ottoman principality began incorporating other Turkish-speaking Muslims and non-Turkish Christians, becoming the Ottoman Turks and ultimately the Turks of the present.

Oxford English Dictionary<====>22641<====>Oxford English Dictionary  The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) is the main historical dictionary of the English language, published by the Oxford University Press.  It traces the historical development of the English language, providing a comprehensive resource to scholars and academic researchers, as well as describing usage in its many variations throughout the world.The second edition came to 21,728 pages in 20 volumes, published in 1989. Work began on the dictionary in 1857, but it was not until 1884 that it began to be published in unbound fascicles as work continued on the project, under the name of A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles; Founded Mainly on the Materials Collected by The Philological Society. 

Ottonian dynasty<====>22644<====>Ottonian dynasty  The Ottonian dynasty ( ) was a Saxon dynasty of German monarchs (919–1024), named after three of its kings and Holy Roman Emperors named Otto, especially its first Emperor Otto I.   It is also known as the Saxon dynasty after the family's origin in the German stem duchy of Saxony.  The family itself is also sometimes known as the Liudolfings (Liudolfinger), after its earliest known member Count Liudolf (d.  866) and one of its primary leading-names.  The Ottonian rulers were successors of the Germanic king Conrad I who was the only Germanic king to rule in East Francia after the Carolingian dynasty and before this dynasty. 

Orkney<====>22645<====>Orkney    Orkney   (   ), also known as the Orkney Islands,"The Orkneys" is used by non-Orcadians and does have historical precedent, yet it is clear that this is frowned upon by the residents.   is an archipelago in the Northern Isles of Scotland, situated off the north coast of Great Britain.  Orkney is 16 kilometres (10 mi) north of the coast of Caithness and comprises approximately 70 islands, of which 20 are inhabited. The largest island, Mainland, is often referred to as "the Mainland".  It has an area of  , making it the sixth-largest Scottish island and the tenth-largest island in the British Isles. 

Hoy<====>22647<====>Hoy   Hoy (from Norse Háey meaning high island) is an island in Orkney, Scotland measuring   — ranked largest in the archipelago after the Mainland.   A natural causeway, the Ayre, links to much smaller South Walls; the two islands are treated as one entity by the UK census.   DescriptionThe dramatic coastline of Hoy greets visitors travelling to Orkney by ferry from the Scottish mainland.  It has extremes of many kinds: some of the highest sea cliffs in the UK at St John's Head, which reach  ; ; a light-stone precarious sea stack taller than the facing cliff – the Old Man of Hoy; patches of northernmost scattered, hardy woodland and the remote possibility of locally extant Orkney charr (Salvelinus inframundus) documented in 1908 at Heldale Water. 

Rousay<====>22648<====>Rousay Rousay (  meaning Rolf's Island) is a small, hilly island about   north of Mainland, the largest island in the Orkney Islands of Scotland, and has been nicknamed "the Egypt of the north", due to its archaeological diversity and importance. It is separated from mainland Orkney by the Eynhallow Sound, and, like its neighbours Egilsay and Wyre, can be reached by ro-ro ferry   from Tingwall, on the mainland of Orkney, which takes 20–25 minutes.  This service is operated by Orkney Ferries, and can take up to 95 passengers (reduced to 50 in winter), and 10 cars. 

Observation<====>22649<====>Observation   Observation is the active acquisition of information from a primary source. In living beings, observation employs the senses. In science, observation can also involve the recording of data via the use of instruments. The term may also refer to any data collected during the scientific activity. Observations can be qualitative, that is, only the absence or presence of a property is noted, or quantitative if a numerical value is attached to the observed phenomenon by counting or measuring.Observation in scienceThe scientific method requires observations of nature to formulate and test hypotheses.It consists of these steps: Asking a question about a natural phenomenonMaking observations of the phenomenonHypothesizing an explanation for the phenomenonPredicting logical, observable consequences of the hypothesis that have not yet been investigatedTesting the hypothesis’ predictions by an experiment, observational study, field study, or simulationForming a conclusion from data gathered in the experiment, or making a revised/new hypothesis and repeating the processWriting out a description of the method of observation and the results or conclusions reachedReview of the results by peers with experience researching the same phenomenon Observations play a role in the second and fifth steps of the scientific method. However the need for reproducibility requires that observations by different observers can be comparable. Human sense impressions are subjective and qualitative, making them difficult to record or compare. The use of measurement developed to allow recording and comparison of observations made at different times and places, by different people. Measurement consists of using observation to compare the phenomenon being observed to a standard unit. The standard unit can be an artifact, process, or definition which can be duplicated or shared by all observers.  In measurement the number of standard units which is equal to the observation is counted.  Measurement reduces an observation to a number which can be recorded, and two observations which result in the same number are equal within the resolution of the process.Senses are limited, and are subject to errors in perception such as optical illusions. Scientific instruments were developed to magnify human powers of observation, such as weighing scales, clocks, telescopes, microscopes, thermometers, cameras, and tape recorders, and also translate into perceptible form events that are unobservable by human senses, such as indicator dyes, voltmeters, spectrometers, infrared cameras, oscilloscopes, interferometers, geiger counters, and radio receivers.One problem encountered throughout scientific fields is that the observation may affect the process being observed, resulting in a different outcome than if the process was unobserved. This is called the observer effect. For example, it is not normally possible to check the air pressure in an automobile tire without letting out some of the air, thereby changing the pressure. However, in most fields of science it is possible to reduce the effects of observation to insignificance by using better instruments.Considered as a physical process itself, all forms of observation (human or instrumental) involve amplification and are thus thermodynamically irreversible processes, increasing entropy.Observational paradoxesIn some specific fields of science the results of observation differ depending on factors which are not important in everyday observation.  These are usually illustrated with "paradoxes" in which an event appears different when observed from two different points of view, seeming to violate "common sense".Relativity: In relativistic physics which deals with velocities close to the speed of light, it is found that different observers may observe different values for the length, time rates, mass, and many other properties of an object, depending on the observer's velocity relative to the object.   For example, in the twin paradox one twin goes on a trip near the speed of light and comes home younger than the twin who stayed at home.  This is not a paradox: time passes at a slower rate when measured from a frame moving with respect to the object.  In relativistic physics, an observation must always be qualified by specifying the state of motion of the observer, its reference frame.Quantum mechanics: In quantum mechanics, which deals with the behavior of very small objects, it is not possible to observe a system without changing the system, and the "observer" must be considered part of the system being observed. In isolation, quantum objects are represented by a wave function which often exists in a superposition or mixture of different states. However, when an observation is made to determine the actual location or state of the object, it always finds the object in a single state, not a "mixture". The interaction of the observation process appears to "collapse" the wave function into a single state. So any interaction between an isolated wave function and the external world that results in this wave function collapse is called an observation or measurement, whether or not it is part of a deliberate observation process.Biases The human senses do not function like a video camcorder, impartially recording all observations.Human perception occurs by a complex, unconscious process of abstraction, in which certain details of the incoming sense data are noticed and remembered, and the rest forgotten.    What is kept and what is thrown away depends on an internal model or representation of the world, called by psychologists a schema, that is built up over our entire lives.  The data is fitted into this schema.  Later when events are remembered, memory gaps may even be filled by "plausible" data the mind makes up to fit the model; this is called reconstructive memory. How much attention the various perceived data are given depends on an internal value system, which judges how important it is to the individual. Thus two people can view the same event and come away with entirely different perceptions of it, even disagreeing about simple facts.  This is why eyewitness testimony is notoriously unreliable.Several of the more important ways observations can be affected by human psychology are given below.Confirmation bias Human observations are biased toward confirming the observer's conscious and unconscious expectations and view of the world; we "see what we expect to see".    In psychology, this is called confirmation bias.    Since the object of scientific research is the discovery of new phenomena, this bias can and has caused new discoveries to be overlooked; one example is the discovery of x-rays. It can also result in erroneous scientific support for widely held cultural myths, on the other hand, as in the scientific racism that supported ideas of racial superiority in the early 20th century.    Correct scientific technique emphasizes careful recording of observations, separating experimental observations from the conclusions drawn from them, and techniques such as blind or double blind experiments, to minimize observational bias."Cargo cult" science Another bias, which has become more prevalent with the advent of "big science" and the large rewards of new discoveries, is bias in favor of the researcher's desired hypothesis or outcome; we "see what we want to see". Called pathological science and cargo cult science, this is different from deliberate falsification of results, and can happen to good-faith researchers.  Researchers with a great incentive or desire for a given outcome can misinterpret or misjudge results, or even persuade themselves they have seen something they haven't.  Possible examples of mistaken discoveries caused by this bias are Martian "canals", N rays, polywater, cold fusion, and perpetual motion machines. Recent decades have seen scientific scandals caused by researchers playing "fast and loose" with observational methods in order to get their pet theories published. This type of bias is rampant in pseudoscience, where correct scientific techniques are not followed. The main defense against this bias, besides correct research techniques, is peer review and repetition of the experiment, or the observation, by other researchers with no incentive to bias. For example, an emerging practice in the competitive field of biotechnology is to require the physical results of experiments, such as serums and tissue cultures, be made available to competing laboratories for independent testing.Processing biasModern scientific instruments can extensively process "observations" before they are presented to the human senses, and particularly with computerized instruments, there is sometimes a question as to where in the data processing chain "observing" ends and "drawing conclusions" begins. This has recently become an issue with digitally enhanced images published as experimental data in papers in scientific journals. The images are enhanced to bring out features that the researcher wants to emphasize, but this also has the effect of supporting the researcher's conclusions. This is a form of bias that is difficult to quantify. Some scientific journals have begun to set detailed standards for what types of image processing are allowed in research results. Computerized instruments often keep a copy of the "raw data" from sensors before processing, which is the ultimate defense against processing bias, and similarly scientific standards require preservation of the original unenhanced "raw" versions of images used as research data.Observational biasAn observational bias occurs when researchers only look where they think they will find positive results, or where it is easy to record observations. This is called the "streetlight effect". Observations in philosophy Observation in philosophical terms is the process of filtering sensory information through the thought process. Input is received via hearing, sight, smell, taste, or touch and then analyzed through either rational or irrational thought. You see a parent beat their child; you observe that such an action is either good or bad.  Deductions about what behaviors are good or bad may be based in no way on preferences about building relationships, or study of the consequences resulting from the observed behavior. With the passage of time, impressions stored in the consciousness about many related observations, together with the resulting relationships and consequences, permit the individual to build a construct about the moral implications of behavior.See alsoIntrospectionList of cognitive biasesNaturalistic observationObservational astronomyObservational errorObservational learningObservational studyObservable quantityObservations and MeasurementsObservatoryObserver effectUncertainty principleReferences  

Oliver Conant<====>22651<====>Oliver ConantOliver Conant (born November 15, 1955) is an American actor. Born in New York City, New York, Conant appeared as "Benji" in the 1971 coming-of-age drama Summer of '42 and Class of '44, appearing in both with Gary Grimes and Jerry Houser as a trio of adolescent boys. He was also in Jean Kerr's 1973 Broadway farce Finishing Touches, with Barbara Bel Geddes, Robert Lansing,  James Woods, and others. After a three decades or so hiatus from acting, Conant re-emerged on off and off-off Broadway stages in productions ranging from Gene Ruffini's dystopian Homeland, Anne Fizzard's back-stage comedy Good Opinions, and Tuvia Tenenbom's absurdist satire Kabbalah. 

Oftel<====>22652<====>OftelThe Office of Telecommunications (Oftel) (the telecommunications regulator) was a department in the United Kingdom government, under civil service control, charged with promoting competition and maintaining the interests of consumers in the UK telecommunications market.  It was set up under the Telecommunications Act 1984 after privatisation of the nationalised operator BT. Oftel was accused by critics such as Freeserve of having been "captured" by BT, and of giving the dominant operator too much freedom to leverage its monopoly status in fixed line telephony into other markets such as ADSL.  On 29 December 2003 the duties of Oftel were inherited by Ofcom, which was the result of the consolidation of five separate British telecommunications, radio spectrum and broadcasting regulators. 

Ohio-class submarine<====>22654<====>Ohio-class submarine  Ohio-class submarine} The Ohio class of nuclear-powered submarines is currently used by the United States Navy.  The navy has 18 Ohio-class submarines: 14 ballistic missile submarines (SSBN) and four that were later converted to guided-missile submarines (SSGN). The Ohio class was named after the lead submarine of this class,  .  The 14 Trident II SSBNs together carry about half of U. S.  active strategic thermonuclear warheads.  Although the Trident missiles have no preset targets when the submarines go on patrol,  they can be given targets quickly using secure and constant radio communications links, including very low frequency systems. 

Ossian<====>22655<====>Ossian  Ossian ( ; Irish Gaelic/Scottish Gaelic: Oisean) is the narrator and purported author of a cycle of epic poems published by the Scottish poet James Macpherson from 1760.  Macpherson claimed to have collected word-of-mouth material in Gaelic, said to be from ancient sources, and that the work was his translation of that material.  Ossian is based on Oisín, son of Finn or Fionn mac Cumhaill, anglicised to Finn McCool, a legendary bard who is a character in Irish mythology.   Contemporary critics were divided in their view of the work's authenticity, but the consensus since is that Macpherson framed the poems himself, based on old folk tales he had collected. 

Operand<====>22656<====>OperandIn mathematics an operand is the object of a mathematical operation, i. e.  it is the quantity that is operated on.  ExampleThe following arithmetic expression shows an example of operators and operands: 3 + 6 = 9 In the above example, '+' is the symbol for the operation called addition.  The operand '3' is one of the inputs (quantities) followed by the addition operator, and the operand '6' is the other input necessary for the operation. The result of the operation is 9.  (The number '9' is also called the sum of the augend 3 and the addend 6. 

Order of magnitude<====>22657<====>Order of magnitudeAn order of magnitude is an approximate measure of the size of a number, equal to the logarithm (base 10) rounded to a whole number.  For example, the order of magnitude of 1500 is 3, because 1500 = 1. 5 × 10 3 . Differences in order of magnitude can be measured on a base-10 logarithmic scale in “decades” (i. e. , factors of ten).   Examples of numbers of different magnitudes can be found at Orders of magnitude (numbers). DefinitionGenerally, the order of magnitude of a number is the smallest power of 10 required to represent that number. 

Occam (programming language)<====>22660<====>Occam (programming language)   occam is a concurrent programming language that builds on the communicating sequential processes (CSP) process algebra,   INMOS document 72 occ 45 03  and shares many of its features.  It is named after William of Ockham of Occam's Razor fame. occam is an imperative procedural language (such as Pascal).  It was developed by David May and others at INMOS, advised by Tony Hoare, as the native programming language for their transputer microprocessors, but implementations for other platforms are available.  The most widely known version is occam 2; its programming manual was written by Steven Ericsson-Zenith and others at INMOS. 

October Revolution<====>22661<====>October Revolution  The October Revolution ( ), officially known in Soviet literature as the Great October Socialist Revolution ( ,  ), and commonly referred to as Red October, the October Uprising, the Bolshevik Revolution,  or Bolshevik Coup was a revolution in Russia led by the Bolsheviks and  Vladimir Lenin that was instrumental in the larger Russian Revolution of 1917.  It took place with an armed insurrection in Petrograd on 25 October (7 November, New Style) 1917. It followed and capitalized on the February Revolution of the same year, which overthrew the Tsarist autocracy and resulted in a provisional government after a transfer of power proclaimed by Grand Duke Michael, brother of Tsar Nicolas II, who declined to take power after the Tsar stepped down. 

Opole Voivodeship<====>22665<====>Opole Voivodeship Opole Voivodeship, or Opole Province  (   ,  ), is the smallest and least populated voivodeship (province) of Poland.  The province's name derives from that of the region's capital and largest city, Opole.  It is part of Upper Silesia.  A relatively large German minority lives in the voivodeship, with representatives in the Sejm. Opole Voivodeship is bordered by Lower Silesian Voivodeship to the west, Greater Poland and Łódź Voivodeships to the north, Silesian Voivodeship to the east, and the Czech Republic to the south. Opole Province's geographic location, economic potential, and its population's level of education make it an attractive business partner for other Polish regions (especially Lower Silesian and Silesian Voivodeships) and for foreign investors. 

Old Norse<====>22666<====>Old Norse    Old Norse was a North Germanic language that was spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and inhabitants of their overseas settlements during about the 9th to 13th centuries. The Proto-Norse language developed into Old Norse by the 8th century, and Old Norse began to develop into the modern North Germanic languages in the mid- to late 14th century, ending the language phase known as Old Norse.  These dates, however, are not absolute, since written Old Norse is found well into the 15th century.  Old Norse was divided into three dialects: Old West Norse, Old East Norse, and Old Gutnish. 

Old English<====>22667<====>Old English Old English ( ), or Anglo-Saxon,  is the earliest historical form of the English language, spoken in England and southern and eastern Scotland in the early Middle Ages.  It was brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers probably in the mid-5th century, and the first Old English literary works date from the mid-7th century.  After the Norman conquest of 1066, English was replaced, for a time, as the language of the upper classes by Anglo-Norman, a relative of French.  This is regarded as marking the end of the Old English era, as during this period the English language was heavily influenced by Anglo-Norman, developing into a phase known now as Middle English. 

Open cluster<====>22669<====>Open cluster An open cluster is a group of up to a few thousand stars that were formed from the same giant molecular cloud and have roughly the same age.  More than 1,100 open clusters have been discovered within the Milky Way Galaxy, and many more are thought to exist.   They are loosely bound by mutual gravitational attraction and become disrupted by close encounters with other clusters and clouds of gas as they orbit the galactic center.  This can result in a migration to the main body of the galaxy and a loss of cluster members through internal close encounters. 

Orimulsion<====>22673<====>Orimulsion Orimulsion is a registered trademark name for a bitumen-based fuel that was developed for industrial use by Intevep, the Research and Development Affiliate of Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), following earlier collaboration on oil emulsions with BP. Source of the bitumenLike coal and oil, bitumen occurs naturally and is obtained from the world's largest deposit in the Orinoco Belt in Venezuela.  The deposit is estimated to be more than 1,200 billion barrels (190 billion m 3 ) of bitumen, an amount approximately equivalent to the world's estimated proven oil reserves.   PreparationRaw bitumen has an extremely high viscosity and specific gravity between 8 and 10 API gravity, at ambient temperatures and is unsuitable for direct use in conventional power stations. 

Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship<====>22676<====>Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship  The Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship contends that Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, wrote the plays and poems traditionally attributed to William Shakespeare.  Though most literary scholars reject all alternative authorship candidates, including Oxford,   popular interest in the Oxfordian theory continues.   Since the 1920s, the Oxfordian theory has been the most popular alternative Shakespeare authorship theory.  The convergence of documentary evidence of the type used by academics for authorial attribution – title pages, testimony by other contemporary poets and historians, and official records – sufficiently establishes Shakespeare's authorship for the overwhelming majority of Shakespeare scholars and literary historians,  and no evidence links Oxford to Shakespeare's works. 

Oxymoron<====>22677<====>Oxymoron An oxymoron (usual plural oxymorons,  more rarely oxymora) is a rhetorical device that uses an ostensible self-contradiction to illustrate a rhetorical point or to reveal a paradox.   A more general meaning of "contradiction in terms" (not necessarily for rhetoric effect) is recorded by the OED for 1902.  The term is first recorded as latinized Greek  , in Maurus Servius Honoratus (c.  AD 400);  it is derived from the Greek"sharp, keen, pointed"  .  Retrieved 2013-02-26.   and"dull, stupid, foolish";  as it were, "sharp-dull", "keenly stupid", or "pointedly foolish". 

Office of Strategic Services<====>22679<====>Office of Strategic Services  The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was a wartime intelligence agency of the United States during World War II, and a predecessor of the modern Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).  The OSS was formed as an agency of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)  to coordinate espionage activities behind enemy lines for all branches of the United States Armed Forces.  Other OSS functions included the use of propaganda, subversion, and post-war planning. OriginPrior to the formation of the OSS, the various departments of the executive branch, including the State, Treasury, Navy, and War Departments conducted American intelligence activities on an ad hoc basis, with no overall direction, coordination, or control. 

Oda Nobunaga<====>22680<====>Oda Nobunaga was a powerful daimyō (feudal lord) of Japan in the late 16th century who attempted to unify Japan during the late Sengoku period.  Nobunaga is regarded as one of three unifiers of Japan along with his retainers Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu.  During his later life, Nobunaga was widely known for most brutal suppression of determined opponents, eliminating those who by principle refused to cooperate or yield to his demands.  He was a skilled ruler and keen businessman, economic reformer, strategizing at both the micro- and macroeconomic scales.  He was killed when his retainer Akechi Mitsuhide rebelled against him at Honnō-ji. 

Otto Wilhelm Hermann von Abich<====>22684<====>Otto Wilhelm Hermann von Abich Otto Wilhelm Hermann von Abich (December 11, 1806 July 1, 1886) was a German mineralogist and geologist.  Full member of St Petersburg Academy of Sciences (hon.  member since 1866). BiographyHe was born at Berlin and educated at the local university.   His earliest scientific work is related to spinels and other minerals.  Later he made special studies of fumaroles, of the mineral deposits around volcanic vents, and of the structure of volcanoes.   In 1842 he was appointed professor of mineralogy in the university of Dorpat (Tartu), and henceforth gave attention to the geology and mineralogy of the Russian Empire. 

Organization of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union<====>22685<====>Organization of the Communist Party of the Soviet UnionThe organization of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was based on the principles of democratic centralism. The governing body of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) was the Party Congress which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under Joseph Stalin.  Party Congresses would elect a Central Committee which, in turn, would elect a Politburo.  Under Stalin, the most powerful position in the party became the General Secretary who was elected by the Politburo.  In 1952 the title of General Secretary became First Secretary and the Politburo became the Presidium before reverting to their former names under Leonid Brezhnev in 1966. 

Oromo people<====>22686<====>Oromo people   The Oromo people ( ;  ; ’Oromo) are an ethnic group inhabiting Ethiopia and parts of Kenya and Somalia.  Merriam-Webster Inc, Frederick C.  Mish, Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, (Merriam-Webster: 2003), p. 876   They are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia and the wider Horn of Africa.  According to the 2007 census,    The CSA estimates a population growth of 7. 6% between the time the census was conducted and the date of its approval:    they represent approximately 34. 5% of Ethiopia's population, while others estimate they make up about 40% of the population. 

Oral history<====>22687<====>Oral historyOral history is the collection and study of historical information about individuals, families, important events, or everyday life using audiotapes, videotapes, or transcriptions of planned interviews.  These interviews are conducted with people who participated in or observed past events and whose memories and perceptions of these are to be preserved as an aural record for future generations.  Oral history strives to obtain information from different perspectives and most of these cannot be found in written sources.  Oral history also refers to information gathered in this manner and to a written work (published or unpublished) based on such data, often preserved in archives and large libraries. 

Oncogene<====>22689<====>Oncogene An oncogene is a gene that has the potential to cause cancer.In tumor cells, they are often mutated and/or expressed at high levels.  Kimball's Biology Pages.  "Oncogenes" Free full text Most normal cells will undergo a programmed form of rapid cell death (apoptosis) when critical functions are altered and malfunctioning.  Activated oncogenes can cause those cells designated for apoptosis to survive and proliferate instead.   Most oncogenes began as proto-oncogenes, normal genes involved in cell growth and proliferation or inhibition of apoptosis.  If normal genes promoting cellular growth, through mutation, are up-regulated, (gain of function mutation) they will predispose the cell to cancer and are thus termed oncogenes. 

Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing<====>22691<====>Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a method of encoding digital data on multiple carrier frequencies.  OFDM has developed into a popular scheme for wideband digital communication, used in applications such as digital television and audio broadcasting, DSL Internet access, wireless networks, powerline networks, and 4G mobile communications. COFDM stands for Coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing.  It differs from OFDM because in COFDM, forward error correction (convolutional coding) and time/frequency interleaving is applied to the signal before transmission.  This is done to overcome errors in mobile communication channels affected by multipath propagation and Doppler effects.  COFDM was first introduced  by Alard in 1986for Digital Audio Broadcasting within the context of Eureka Project 147 . 

Operator overloading<====>22693<====>Operator overloading In programming, operator overloading, sometimes termed operator ad hoc polymorphism, is a specific case of polymorphism, where different operators have different implementations depending on their arguments.  Operator overloading is generally defined by a programming language, a programmer, or both. MotiveOperator overloading is syntactic sugar, and is used because it allows programming using notation nearer to the target domain  and allows user-defined types a similar level of syntactic support as types built into a language.  It is common, for example, in scientific computing, where it allows computing representations of mathematical objects to be manipulated with the same syntax as on paper. 

Omphalos hypothesis<====>22700<====>Omphalos hypothesis  The omphalos hypothesis is the pseudoscientific  argument that God created the universe recently (within the past ten thousand years, in keeping with flood geology), but also introduced false evidence that the universe is of great age.  It was named after the title of an 1857 book, Omphalos by Philip Henry Gosse, in which Gosse argued that in order for the world to be "functional", God must have created the Earth with mountains and canyons, trees with growth rings, Adam and Eve with hair, fingernails, and navels    (ὀμφαλός omphalos is Greek for "navel"), and that therefore no evidence that we can see of the presumed age of the Earth and universe can be taken as reliable. 

Origen<====>22702<====>Origen    Origen of Alexandria ( ;  , Ōrigénēs), or Origen Adamantius ( , Ōrigénēs Adamántios; 184/185 – 253/254),  was a Greek scholar, ascetic,    and early Christian theologian who was born and spent the first half of his career in Alexandria.  He was a prolific writer and wrote over 800 treatises in multiple branches of theology, including textual criticism, biblical exegesis and hermeneutics, philosophical theology, preaching, and spirituality.  He was one of the most influential figures in early Christian asceticism.   Origen is a church fatherand he is widely regarded as one of the most important Christian theologians of all time. 

Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate<====>22703<====>Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate}   The Oliver Hazard Perry class is a class of guided missile frigates named after the American Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, the hero of the naval Battle of Lake Erie.  Also known as the Perry or FFG-7 class, the warships were designed in the United States in the mid-1970s as general-purpose escort vessels inexpensive enough to be bought in large quantities to replace World War II-era destroyers and complement 1960s-era  s.  In Admiral Elmo Zumwalt's "high low fleet plan", the FFG-7s were the low capability ships with the  s serving as the high capability ships. 

Ottawa Senators<====>22705<====>Ottawa Senators    The Ottawa Senators ( ) are a professional ice hockey team based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  They are members of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL).  The Senators play their home games at the 17,373 seat  Canadian Tire Centre which opened in 1996 as the Palladium. Founded and established by Ottawa real estate developer Bruce Firestone, the team is the second NHL franchise to use the Ottawa Senators name.  The original Ottawa Senators, founded in 1883, had a famed history, winning 11 Stanley Cups  and playing in the NHL from 1917 until 1934. 

Orchestra<====>22706<====>Orchestra An orchestra (  or  ;  ) is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which mixes instruments from different families, including bowed string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, each grouped in sections.  Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments. The term orchestra derives from the Greek ὀορχήστρα (orchestra), the name for the area in front of a stage in ancient Greek theatre reserved for the Greek chorus. 

Oolong<====>22707<====>Oolong   Oolong ( ) ( ) is a traditional Chinese tea (Camellia sinensis) produced through a process including withering the plant under strong sun and oxidation before curling and twisting.  Zhongguo Chajing pp222-234, pp419-412, & pp271-282, chief editor: Chen Zhongmao, publisher: Shanghai Wenhua Chubanshe (Shanghai Cultural Publishers) 1991.   Most oolong teas, especially those of fine quality, involve unique tea plant cultivars that are exclusively used for particular varieties.  The degree of oxidation can range from 8–85%,  depending on the variety and production style.  Oolong is especially popular in south China and among Chinese expatriates in Southeast Asia,  as is the Fujian preparation process known as the Gongfu tea ceremony. 

Okapi<====>22709<====>Okapi    The okapi ( ; Okapia johnstoni), also known as the forest giraffe or zebra giraffe, is an artiodactyl mammal native to the northeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Central Africa.  Although the okapi bears striped markings reminiscent of zebras, it is most closely related to the giraffe.  The okapi and the giraffe are the only living members of the family Giraffidae.  The okapi stands about   tall at the shoulder and has an average body length around  .  Its weight ranges from  .  It has a long neck, and large, flexible ears. 

Ovary<====>22710<====>Ovary    The ovary  is an organ found in the female reproductive system that produces an ovum.  When released, this travels down the fallopian tube into the uterus, where it may become fertilised by a sperm.  There is an ovary ( ) found on the left and the right side of the body.  The ovaries also secrete hormones that play a role in the menstrual cycle and fertility.  The ovary progresses through many stages beginning in the prenatal period through menopause.  It is also an endocrine gland because of the various hormones that it secretes. 

Opium<====>22713<====>Opium    Opium (poppy tears, with the scientific name: Lachryma papaveris) is the dried latex obtained from the opium poppy (scientific name: Papaver somniferum).Opium latex contains approximately 12 percent of the analgesic alkaloid morphine, which is processed chemically to produce heroin and other synthetic opioids for medicinal use and for illegal drug trade.  The latex also contains the closely related opiates codeine and thebaine, and non-analgesic alkaloids such as papaverine and noscapine.  The traditional, labor-intensive method of obtaining the latex is to scratch ("score") the immature seed pods (fruits) by hand; the latex leaks out and dries to a sticky yellowish residue that is later scraped off and dehydrated. 

Online algorithm<====>22716<====>Online algorithm In computer science, an online algorithm  is one that can process its input piece-by-piece in a serial fashion, i. e. , in the order that the input is fed to the algorithm, without having the entire input available from the start. In contrast, an offline algorithm is given the whole problem data from the beginning and is required to output an answer which solves the problem at hand.  In operations research, the area in which online algorithms are developed is called online optimization. As an example, consider the sorting algorithms selection sort and insertion sort: Selection sort repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted remainder and places it at the front, which requires access to the entire input; it is thus an offline algorithm. 

Ozone<====>22718<====>Ozone   Ozone  , or trioxygen, is an inorganic molecule with the chemical formula  .  It is a pale blue gas with a distinctively pungent smell.  It is an allotrope of oxygen that is much less stable than the diatomic allotrope  , breaking down in the lower atmosphere to   or dioxygen.  Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of ultraviolet light and also atmospheric electrical discharges, and is present in very low concentrations throughout the Earth's atmosphere (stratosphere).  Its concentration is highest in the ozone layer region of the atmosphere, which absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation. 

Orchidaceae<====>22719<====>Orchidaceae   The Orchidaceae are a diverse and widespread  family of flowering plants, with blooms that are often colourful and fragrant, commonly known as the orchid family. Along with the Asteraceae, they are one of the two largest families of flowering plants.  The Orchidaceae have about 28,000 currently accepted species, distributed in about 763 genera.  (See External links below).   The determination of which family is larger is still under debate, because verified data on the members of such enormous families are continually in flux.  Regardless, the number of orchid species nearly equals the number of bony fishes and is more than twice the number of bird species, and about four times the number of mammal species. 

Obsidian<====>22721<====>Obsidian   Obsidian is a naturally occurring volcanic glass formed as an extrusive igneous rock.   It is produced when felsic lava extruded from a volcano cools rapidly with minimal crystal growth.   Obsidian is commonly found within the margins of rhyolitic lava flows known as obsidian flows, where the chemical composition (high silica content) induces a high viscosity and polymerization degree of the lava.  The inhibition of atomic diffusion through this highly viscous and polymerized lava explains the lack of crystal growth.  Obsidian is hard and brittle; it therefore fractures with very sharp edges, which were used in the past in cutting and piercing tools, and it has been used experimentally as surgical scalpel blades. 

Otaku<====>22722<====>Otaku  is a Japanese term for people with obsessive interests, commonly the anime and manga fandom.  Its contemporary usage originated with Akio Nakamori's 1983 essay in Manga Burikko.   Otaku may be used as a pejorative; its negativity stems from the stereotypical view of otaku and the media's reporting on Tsutomu Miyazaki, "The Otaku Murderer", in 1989.  According to studies published in 2013, the term has become less negative, and an increasing number of people now self-identify as otaku.  Otaku subculture is a central theme of various anime and manga works, documentaries and academic research. 

Object-modeling language<====>22723<====>Object-modeling languageAn object-modeling language is a standardized set of symbols used to model a software system using an object-oriented framework.  The symbols can be either informal or formal ranging from predefined graphical templates to formal object models defined by grammars and specifications. A modeling language is usually associated with a methodology for object-oriented development.  The modeling language defines the elements of the model.  E. g. , that a model has classes, methods, object properties, etc.  The methodology defines the steps developers and users need to take to develop and maintain a software system.  Steps such as Define requirements, Develop code, and Test system. 

On Fairy-Stories<====>22725<====>On Fairy-Stories   "On Fairy-Stories" is an essay by J.  R.  R.  Tolkien which discusses the fairy-story as a literary form.  It was initially written (and entitled simply "Fairy Stories") for presentation by Tolkien as the Andrew Lang lecture at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, in 1939. HistoryIn the lecture, Tolkien chose to focus on Andrew Lang’s work as a folklorist and collector of fairy tales.  He disagreed with Lang's broad inclusion in his Fairy Books collection (1889–1910), of traveller's tales, beast fables, and other types of stories.  Tolkien held a narrower perspective, viewing fairy stories as those that took place in Faerie, an enchanted realm, with or without fairies as characters. 

Otaku no Video<====>22727<====>Otaku no Videois a 1991 comedy anime spoofing the life and culture of otaku, individuals with obsessive interests in media, particularly anime and manga, as well as the history of Gainax, its creators.   It is noted for its mix of conventional documentary film styles (with actual film, no less), with a more traditional anime storytelling fashion.  It is licensed in the United States by AnimEigo.  The DAICON III and IV Opening Animations from the early eighties are also featured in this OVA. Plot summaryThe story begins in Otaku no Video 1982, where the main character is an everyman character,  Ken Kubo, living with his girlfriend Yoshiko and as a member of his college's tennis team, until introduced by his former friend Tanaka to a club of enthusiasts: a female illustrator, an information geek, a martial artist, and a weapons collector.

(Punctum Books 2012  , p.  62  is the Christian doctrine of humanity's state of sin resulting from the fall of man, stemming from Adam and Eve's rebellion in Eden, namely the sin of disobedience in consuming from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. 

Operation Enduring Freedom<====>22738<====>Operation Enduring Freedom   Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) is the official name used by the U. S.  government for the Global War on Terrorism between 2001 and 2014.  On October 7, 2001, in response to the September 11 attacks, President George W.  Bush announced that airstrikes targeting Al Qaeda and the Taliban had begun in Afghanistan.   Operation Enduring Freedom primarily refers to the War in Afghanistan,  but it is also affiliated with counterterrorism operations in other countries, such as OEF-Philippines and OEF-Trans Sahara.  After 13 years, on December 28, 2014, President Barack Obama announced the end of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. 

Obfuscation (software)<====>22739<====>Obfuscation (software) In software development, obfuscation is the deliberate act of creating source or machine code that is difficult for humans to understand.  Like obfuscation in natural language, it may use needlessly roundabout expressions to compose statements. Programmers may deliberately obfuscate code to conceal its purpose (security through obscurity) or its logic or implicit values embedded in it, primarily, in order to prevent tampering, deter reverse engineering, or even as a puzzle or recreational challenge for someone reading the source code.  This can be done manually or by using an automated tool, the latter being the preferred technique in industry. 

Ötzi<====>22742<====>Ötzi Ötzi ( ; also called the Iceman, the Similaun Man, the Man from Hauslabjoch, the Tyrolean Iceman, and the Hauslabjoch mummy) is a nickname given to the well-preserved natural mummy of a man who lived between 3400 and 3100 BCE.The mummy was found in September 1991 in the Ötztal Alps, hence the nickname "Ötzi", near Similaun mountain and Hauslabjoch on the border between Austria and Italy.    He is Europe's oldest known natural human mummy, and has offered an unprecedented view of Chalcolithic Europeans.  His body and belongings are displayed in the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, South Tyrol, Italy. 

Operation Deadlight<====>22743<====>Operation DeadlightOperation Deadlight was the code name for the Royal Navy operation to scuttle German U-boats surrendered to the Allies after the defeat of Germany near the end of World War II. Of the 156 U-boats that surrendered to the allies at the end of the war, 116 were scuttled as part of Operation Deadlight.The operation was carried out by the Royal Navy and it was planned to tow the submarines to three areas about 100 miles north-west of Ireland and sink them.   The areas were codenamed XX, YY and ZZ.   The intention was to use XX as the main area for scuttling while 36 boats would be towed to ZZ for use as targets for aerial attack. 

Order of the Eastern Star<====>22746<====>Order of the Eastern Star The Order of the Eastern Star is a Masonic appendant body open to both men and women.  It was established in 1850 by lawyer and educator Rob Morris, a noted Freemason, but was only adopted and approved as an appendant body of the Masonic Fraternity in 1873.   The order is based on teachings from the Bible,  but is open to people of all religious beliefs.  It has approximately 10,000 chapters in twenty countries and approximately 500,000 members under its General Grand Chapter. Members of the Order of the Eastern Star are aged 18 and older; men must be Master Masons and women must have specific relationships with Masons. 

OSI model<====>22747<====>OSI model The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology.  Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard protocols.  The model partitions a communication system into abstraction layers.  The original version of the model defined seven layers. A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it.  For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that comprise the contents of that path. 

Original Sin (2001 film)<====>22751<====>Original Sin (2001 film) Original Sin is a 2001 erotic thriller film starring Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie.  It is based on the novel Waltz into Darkness by Cornell Woolrich, and is a remake of the 1969 François Truffaut film Mississippi Mermaid.   The movie was produced by actress Michelle Pfeiffer's production company, Via Rosa Productions.  PlotOriginal Sin is set in the late 19th century Cuba during the Spanish rule,   and flashes back and forth from the scene of a woman awaiting her execution by garrote while telling her story to a priest, to the actual events of that story. 

Oscar Hammerstein II<====>22753<====>Oscar Hammerstein II  Oscar Greeley Clendenning Hammerstein II ( ; July 12, 1895 – August 23, 1960) was an American librettist, theatrical producer, and (usually uncredited) theatre director of musicals for almost forty years.  Hammerstein won eight Tony Awards and two Academy Awards for Best Original Song.  Many of his songs are standard repertoire for vocalists and jazz musicians.   He co-wrote 850 songs.  Hammerstein was the lyricist and playwright in his partnerships; his collaborators wrote the music.  Hammerstein collaborated with numerous composers, such as Jerome Kern, with whom he wrote Show Boat, Vincent Youmans, Rudolf Friml, Richard A. 

Otto Jespersen<====>22756<====>Otto Jespersen   Jens Otto Harry Jespersen or Otto Jespersen ( ; 16 July 1860 – 30 April 1943) was a Danish linguist who specialized in the grammar of the English language. Early lifeOtto Jespersen was born in Randers in Jutland.  He was inspired by the work of Danish philologist Rasmus Rask as a boy, and with the help of Rask's grammars taught himself some Icelandic, Italian, and Spanish.   He entered the University of Copenhagen in 1877 when he was 17, initially studying law but not forgetting his language studies.  In 1881 he shifted his focus completely to languages,  and in 1887 earned his master's degree in French, with English and Latin as his secondary languages. 

List of object-oriented programming languages<====>22758<====>List of object-oriented programming languages This is a list of notable programming languages with object-oriented programming (OOP) features, which are also listed in Category:Object-oriented programming languages.  Note that, in some contexts, the definition of an "object-oriented programming language" is not exactly the same as that of a "programming language with object-oriented features" .  For example, C++ is a multi-paradigm language including object-oriented paradigm , however, it is less object-oriented than some other languages such as Python  and Ruby .  Therefore someone considers C++ as an OOP language, while others do not or prefer to name it as "semi-object-oriented programming language".

Occidental language<====>22761<====>Occidental language   The language Occidental, later Interlingue, is a planned international auxiliary language created by the Balto-German naval officer and teacher Edgar de Wahl, and published in 1922.  The vocabulary is based on already existing words from various languages.  The language is thereby naturalistic, at the same time as it is constructed to be regular.   Occidental was quite popular in the years before the Second World War, but declined in the years thereafter. Occidental is devised so that many of its derived word forms reflect the similar forms common to a number of Western European languages, primarily those in the Romance family. 

Osiris<====>22763<====>Osiris    Osiris ( , from Egyptian wsjr, Coptic  )   is an Egyptian god, identified as the god of the afterlife, the underworld, and the dead, but more appropriately as the god of transition, resurrection, and regeneration.  He was classically depicted as a green-skinned deity with a pharaoh's beard, partially mummy-wrapped at the legs, wearing a distinctive crown with two large ostrich feathers at either side, and holding a symbolic crook and flail. Osiris was at times considered the oldest son of the god Geb, though other sources state his father is the sun-god Ra,    and the sky goddess Nut, as well as being brother and husband of Isis, with Horus being considered his posthumously begotten son. 

Orthodox Bahá'í Faith<====>22764<====>Orthodox Bahá'í Faith The Orthodox Bahá'í Faith is a small Bahá'í sect that formed in 1960 by Mason Remey, and subsequently was the name used by Joel Marangella after he claimed to be Remey's successor.  The basis of the dispute is over the identity of the Guardian, a term referring to the appointed head of the religion, an executive hereditary office held by Shoghi Effendi from 1921 to 1957. Other than on the matter of leadership and organization, there are few differences between the orthodox and mainstream Bahá'ís in matters of doctrine.  As a group who believe that Mason Remey was the second Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, they are considered heretical Covenant-breakers by the majority of Bahá'ís who follow the leadership of the Universal House of Justice. 

1<====>22770<====>1   1 (one, also called unit, unity, and (multiplicative) identity) is a number, numeral, and glyph.  It represents a single entity, the unit of counting or measurement.  For example, a line segment of unit length is a line segment of length 1.  It is also the first of the infinite sequence of natural numbers, followed by 2. EtymologyThe word one can be used as a noun, an adjective and a pronoun.    It comes from the English word an,  which comes from the Proto-Germanic root *ainaz.   The Proto-Germanic root *ainaz comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *oi-no-. 

Oxidative phosphorylation<====>22773<====>Oxidative phosphorylationOxidative phosphorylation (or OXPHOS in short) is the metabolic pathway in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing energy which is used to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP).  In most eukaryotes, this takes place inside mitochondria.  Almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation.  This pathway is probably so pervasive because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy, compared to alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis. During oxidative phosphorylation, electrons are transferred from electron donors to electron acceptors such as oxygen, in redox reactions.  These redox reactions release energy, which is used to form ATP. 

Old Fashioned<====>22775<====>Old Fashioned  The Old Fashioned is a cocktail made by muddling sugar with bitters, then adding alcohol, originally whiskey but now sometimes brandy, and finally a twist of citrus (or orange) rind.  It is traditionally served in a short, round, tumbler-like glass, which is called an Old Fashioned glass, named after the drink. The Old Fashioned, developed during the 19th century and given its name in the 1880s, is an IBA Official Cocktail.It is also one of six basic drinks listed in David A.  Embury's The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks. HistoryThe first documented definition of the word "cocktail" was in response to a reader's letter asking to define the word in the May 6, 1806 issue of The Balance and Columbian Repository in Hudson, New York. 

Omnipotence<====>22776<====>Omnipotence Omnipotence is the quality of having unlimited power.  Monotheistic religions generally attribute omnipotence to only the deity of their faith.  In the monotheistic philosophies of Abrahamic religions, omnipotence is often listed as one of a deity's characteristics among many, including omniscience, omnipresence, and omnibenevolence.  The presence of all these properties in a single entity has given rise to considerable theological debate, prominently including the problem of theodicy, the question of why such a deity would permit the manifestation of evil. MeaningsThe term omnipotent has been used to connote a number of different positions.  These positions include, but are not limited to, the following:A deity is able to do anything that it chooses to do. 

Octopus<====>22780<====>Octopus  The octopus (  or ~ ) is a soft-bodied, eight-armed mollusc of the order Octopoda.  Around 300 species are recognised and the order is grouped within the class Cephalopoda with squids, cuttlefish and nautiloids.  Like other cephalopods, the octopus is bilaterally symmetric with two eyes and a beak, with its mouth at the centre point of the arms (which are sometimes mistakenly called "tentacles").  The soft body can rapidly alter its shape, enabling octopuses to squeeze through small gaps.  They trail their eight arms behind them as they swim. 

Omniscience<====>22781<====>Omniscience   Omniscience  ,  mainly in religion, is the capacity to know everything that there is to know.  In particular, dharmic religions (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism) and the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) believe that there is a divine being who is omniscient. Definitions There is a distinction between: inherent omniscience, the ability to know anything that one chooses to know and can be known. total omniscience, actually knowing everything that can be known. Some modern Christian theologians argue that God's omniscience is inherent rather than total, and that God chooses to limit his omniscience in order to preserve the freewill and dignity of his creatures. 

Original Chip Set<====>22784<====>Original Chip Set  The Original Chip Set (OCS) is a chipset used in the earliest Commodore Amiga computers and defined the Amiga's graphics and sound capabilities.  It was succeeded by the slightly improved Enhanced Chip Set (ECS) and greatly improved Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA). The original chipset appeared in Amiga models built between 1985 and 1990: the Amiga 1000, Amiga 2000, Amiga CDTV, and Amiga 500. Overview of chipsThe chipset which gave the Amiga its unique graphics features consists of three main "custom" chips; Agnus, Denise, and Paula.  Both the original chipset and the enhanced chipset were manufactured using NMOS logic technology by Commodore's chip manufacturing subsidiary, MOS Technology. 

Optic neuritis<====>22786<====>Optic neuritis  Optic neuritis is a demyelinating inflammation of the optic nerve.  It is also known as optic papillitis (when the head of the optic nerve is involved) and retrobulbar neuritis (when the posterior part of the nerve is involved).   It is most often associated with multiple sclerosis, and it may lead to complete or partial loss of vision in one or both eyes. Partial, transient vision loss (lasting less than one hour) can be an indication of early onset multiple sclerosis .  Other possible diagnoses include: diabetes mellitus, low phosphorus levels, or hyperkalaemia. Signs and symptomsMajor symptoms are sudden loss of vision (partial or complete), sudden blurred or "foggy" vision, and pain on movement of the affected eye.

Organization of American States<====>22788<====>Organization of American States  The Organization of American States ( ,  ,  ), or the OAS or OEA, is a continental organization that was founded on 30 April 1948, for the purposes of regional solidarity and cooperation among its member states.   Headquartered in the United States capital Washington, D. C. ,  the OAS's members are the 35 independent states of the Americas. As of 26 May 2015, the Secretary General of OAS is Luis Almagro.    HistoryThe notion of an international union in the New World was first put forward by Simón Bolívar  who, at the 1826 Congress of Panama (still being part of Colombia), proposed creating a league of American republics, with a common military, a mutual defense pact, and a supranational parliamentary assembly. 

World Organisation for Animal Health<====>22789<====>World Organisation for Animal Health    The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) is an intergovernmental organization coordinating, supporting and promoting animal disease control. Mission and statusThe main objective of the OIE is to control epizootic  diseases and thus to prevent their spread.   Other objectives consist of: transparency, scientific information, international solidarity, sanitary safety, the promotion of Veterinary Services, food safety and animal welfare.  It is recognized as a reference organisation by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and in 2014 had a total of 181 member states.  The OIE maintains permanent relations with 45 other international and regional organisations and has Regional and sub-regional Offices on every continent. 

Ozzie Smith<====>22790<====>Ozzie Smith  Osborne Earl "Ozzie" Smith (born December 26, 1954) is an American former baseball shortstop who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres and St.  Louis Cardinals from 1978 to 1996.  Nicknamed "The Wizard" for his defensive brilliance, Smith set major league records for career assists (8,375) and double plays (1,590) by a shortstop (the latter since broken by Omar Vizquel), as well as the National League (NL) record with 2,511 career games at the position; Smith won the NL Gold Glove Award for play at shortstop for 13 consecutive seasons (1980–92). 

Boeing OC-135B Open Skies<====>22791<====>Boeing OC-135B Open Skies  The OC-135B Open Skies United States Air Force observation aircraft supports the Treaty on Open Skies.The aircraft, a modified WC-135B, flies unarmed observation flights over participating parties of the treaty.  Three OC-135B aircraft were modified by the Aeronautical Systems Center's 4950th Test Wing at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.  The first operationally-capable OC-135B was assigned to the 24th Reconnaissance Squadron at Offutt AFB in October 1993.  It is now fitted with a basic set of navigational and sensor equipment, and was placed in inviolate storage at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base near Tucson, Arizona in 1997. 

Treaty on Open Skies<====>22792<====>Treaty on Open Skies   The Treaty on Open Skies entered into force on January 1, 2002, and currently has 34 party states.  It establishes a program of unarmed aerial surveillance flights over the entire territory of its participants.  The treaty is designed to enhance mutual understanding and confidence by giving all participants, regardless of size, a direct role in gathering information about military forces and activities of concern to them.  Open Skies is one of the most wide-ranging international efforts to date promoting openness and transparency of military forces and activities.  The concept of "mutual aerial observation" was initially proposed to Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin at the Geneva Conference of 1955 by President Dwight D. 

Limited overs cricket<====>22794<====>Limited overs cricket   Limited overs cricket, also known as one-day cricket and in a slightly different context as List A cricket, is a version of the sport of cricket in which a match is generally completed in one day, whereas Test and first-class matches can take up to five days to complete.  The name reflects the rule that in the match each team bowls a set maximum number of overs, usually between 20 and 50, although shorter and longer forms of limited overs cricket have been played. One-day cricket is popular with spectators as it can encourage aggressive, risky, entertaining batting, often results in cliffhanger endings, and ensures that a spectator can watch an entire match without committing to five days of continuous attendance. 

Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe<====>22796<====>Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe   The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) is the world's largest security-oriented intergovernmental organization.  Its mandate includes issues such as arms control, promotion of human rights, freedom of the press, and fair elections.  It employs around 3,460 people, mostly in its field operations but also in its secretariat in Vienna, Austria and its institutions.  It has its origins in the 1975 Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) held in Helsinki, Finland. The OSCE is concerned with early warning, conflict prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict rehabilitation. 

Omri<====>22798<====>Omri   Omri ( ; fl.  9th century BC) was, according to the Hebrew Bible, the sixth king of Israel.  He was a successful military campaigner who extended the northern kingdom of Israel.  Other monarchs from the House of Omri are Ahab, Ahaziah, Joram, and Athaliah.  Like his predecessor, king Zimri, who ruled for only seven days, Omri is the second king mentioned in the Bible without a statement of his tribal origin: although some scholars speculate that Omri was from the tribe of Issachar, this is not yet confirmed by any scientific or historical evidence. 

Oxycodone<====>22799<====>Oxycodone   Oxycodone is a semisynthetic opioid synthesized from thebaine, an opioid alkaloid found in the Persian poppy, and one of the many alkaloids found in the opium poppy.  It is a moderately potent opioid pain medication (orally roughly 1. 5 times more potent than morphine),  generally indicated for relief of moderate to severe pain.   Oxycodone was developed in 1917 in Germany   as one of several semi-synthetic opioids in an attempt to improve on the existing opioids.    Oxycodone is available as single-ingredient medication in immediate release and controlled release.   In the United Kingdom, it is available in 10 mg/mL and 50 mg/mL formulation for intramuscular or intravenous administration. 

Occidental College<====>22800<====>Occidental College Occidental College is a private liberal arts college located in the Eagle Rock neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.  Founded in 1887 by clergy and members of the Presbyterian Church, it is one of the oldest liberal arts colleges on the West Coast.  Occidental College is often referred to as "Oxy" for short.  In 2017, the Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education College Rankings placed Occidental 27th on its list of the top 100 liberal arts colleges in the United States.   The New York Times ranked Occidental No.  28 on its 2017 list of the most economically diverse U. 

1986 United States bombing of Libya<====>22801<====>1986 United States bombing of Libya  The 1986 United States bombing of Libya, code-named Operation El Dorado Canyon, comprised air strikes by the United States against Libya on Tuesday, 15 April 1986.  The attack was carried out by the U. S.  Air Force, U. S.  Navy and U. S.  Marine Corps via air strikes, in retaliation for the 1986 West Berlin discotheque bombing.  There were 40 reported Libyan casualties, and one U. S.  plane was shot down.  One of the Libyan dead was a baby girl, who was reported to be Muammar Gaddafi's daughter, Hana Gaddafi. 

Operational amplifier<====>22804<====>Operational amplifier An operational amplifier (often op-amp or opamp) is a DC-coupled high-gain electronic voltage amplifier with a differential input and, usually, a single-ended output.   In this configuration, an op-amp produces an output potential (relative to circuit ground) that is typically hundreds of thousands of times larger than the potential difference between its input terminals. Operational amplifiers had their origins in analog computers, where they were used to perform mathematical operations in many linear, non-linear, and frequency-dependent circuits.  The popularity of the op-amp as a building block in analog circuits is due to its versatility.   Due to negative feedback, the characteristics  of an op-amp circuit, its gain, input and output impedance, bandwidth etc. 

Oh Hell<====>22807<====>Oh Hell  Oh Hell is a trick-taking card game in which the object is to take exactly the number of tricks bid, unlike contract bridge and spades: taking more tricks than bid is a loss.  Its first appearance dates to the early 1930s and it is sometimes credited to the McCandless family.  ConceptThe game of Oh Hell explores the idea of taking an exact number of tricks specified by a bid before the hand.  It differs from other trick-taking games in that players play a fixed number of hands.  The game uses trumps, often decided by a cut of the deck after the hand's cards have been distributed. 

On War<====>22808<====>On War   Vom Kriege ( ) is a book on war and military strategy by Prussian general Carl von Clausewitz (1780–1831), written mostly after the Napoleonic wars, between 1816 and 1830, and published posthumously by his wife Marie von Brühl in 1832.    It has been translated into English several times as On War.  On War is actually an unfinished work; Clausewitz had set about revising his accumulated manuscripts in 1827, but did not live to finish the task.  His wife edited his collected works and published them between 1832 and 1835.  His 10-volume collected works contain most of his larger historical and theoretical writings, though not his shorter articles and papers or his extensive correspondence with important political, military, intellectual and cultural leaders in the Prussian state. 

Orange Alternative<====>22810<====>Orange Alternative The Orange Alternative (Polish: Pomarańczowa Alternatywa) is a Polish anti-communist underground movement, started in Wrocław, a city in south-west Poland and led by Waldemar Fydrych (sometimes misspelled as Frydrych), commonly known as Major (Commander of Festung Breslau) in the 1980s.Its main purpose was to offer a wider group of citizens an alternative way of opposition against the authoritarian regime by means of a peaceful protest that used absurd and nonsensical elements. By doing this, members of the Orange Alternative could not be arrested by the police for opposition to the regime without the authorities becoming a laughing stock. 

Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor<====>22811<====>Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor  Otto IV (1175 – 19 May 1218) was one of two rival kings of Germany from 1198 on, sole king from 1208 on, and Holy Roman Emperor from 1209 until he was forced to abdicate in 1215.  The only German king of the Welf dynasty, he incurred the wrath of Pope Innocent III and was excommunicated in 1210. CareerEarly lifeOtto was  the third son of Henry the Lion, Duke of Bavaria and Saxony, and Matilda of England.  Bryce, pg.  206  His exact birthplace is not given by any original source. 

Outcome-based education<====>22816<====>Outcome-based educationOutcome-based education (OBE) is an educational theory that bases each part of an educational system around goals (outcomes).  By the end of the educational experience, each student should have achieved the goal.  There is no single specified style of teaching or assessment in OBE; instead, classes, opportunities, and assessments should all help students achieve the specified outcomes.The role of the faculty adapts into instructor, trainer, facilitator, and/or mentor based on the outcomes targeted. Outcome-based methods have been adopted in education systems around the world, at multiple levels.  Australia and South Africa adopted OBE policies in the early 1990s but have since been phased out. 

Olga of Kiev<====>22817<====>Olga of Kiev  Saint Olga ( , died 969 AD in Kiev) was a regent of Kievan Rus' for her son Svyatoslav from 945 until 960.  She is known for her obliteration of the Drevlians, a tribe that had killed her husband Igor of Kiev.  Even though it would be her grandson Vladimir that would convert the entire nation to Christianity, for her efforts to spread Christianity through the Rus' Olga is venerated as a saint.  While her birthdate is unknown, it could be as early as AD 890 and as late as 5 June 925. 

Olympus Mons<====>22818<====>Olympus Mons  Olympus Mons ( ;   Latin for Mount Olympus) is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars.  By one measure, it has a height of nearly 22 km (13. 6 mi or 72,000 ft). Olympus Monsstands about two and a half times as tall as Mount Everest's height above sea level.  It is the tallest mountain in the Solar System.  It is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars's Hesperian Period.  It is currently the largest volcano discovered in the Solar System and had been known to astronomers since the late 19th century as the albedo feature Nix Olympica (Latin for "Olympic Snow").

Object database<====>22826<====>Object databaseAn object database  is a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming.  Object databases are different from relational databases which are table-oriented.   Object-relational databases are a hybrid of both approaches. Object databases have been considered since the early 1980s.  OverviewObject-oriented database management systems (OODBMSs) also called ODBMS (Object Database Management System)  combines database capabilities with object-oriented programming language capabilities. OODBMSs allow object-oriented programmers to develop the product, store them as objects, and replicate or modify existing objects to make new objects within the OODBMS. 

Ovo-lacto vegetarianism<====>22827<====>Ovo-lacto vegetarianism An ovo-lacto vegetarian or lacto-ovo vegetarian is a vegetarian who does not eat meat, but does consume some animal products such as eggs and dairy.  Unlike pescatarians, they do not consume fish or other seafood.  A typical ovo-lacto vegetarian diet can include fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, seeds, herbs, roots, fungi, milk, cheese, yogurt, kefir, and eggs.   EtymologyThe terminology stems from the Latin lac meaning "milk" (as in 'lactation'), ovum meaning "egg", and the English term vegetarian, so as giving the definition of a vegetarian diet containing milk and eggs. DietIn the Western world, ovo-lacto vegetarians are the most common type of vegetarian. 

Orgy of the Dead<====>22829<====>Orgy of the Dead  Orgy of the Dead is a 1965 erotic horror film directed by Stephen C.  Apostolof under the alias A.  C.  Stephen.  The screenplay was written by cult film director Edward D.  Wood Jr. .   He adapted the screenplay into a novel. GenreThe film belongs to the genre of nudie cuties, narrative-based films featuring female nudity.  It was an evolution of earlier films, which featured striptease and burlesque shows.  These predecessors mostly depicted actual stage performances, sometimes attached to a frame story.  Craig (2009), p.  217-241 PlotThe film opens to two muscle-bound men dressed in loincloths approaching a crypt. 

Ostwald process<====>22830<====>Ostwald processThe Ostwald process is a chemical process for making nitric acid (HNO 3 ).  Wilhelm Ostwald developed the process, and he patented it in 1902.The Ostwald process is a mainstay of the modern chemical industry, and it provides the main raw material for the most common type of fertilizer production.   Historically and practically, the Ostwald process is closely associated with the Haber process, which provides the requisite raw material, ammonia (NH 3 ). DescriptionAmmonia is converted to nitric acid in 2 stages.   It is oxidized by heating with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst such as platinum with 10% rhodium, to form nitric oxide /nitrogen(ii)oxide and water/steam. 

Oliver Heaviside<====>22831<====>Oliver Heaviside    Oliver Heaviside FRS  ( ; 18 May 1850 – 3 February 1925) was an English self-taught electrical engineer, mathematician, and physicist who adapted complex numbers to the study of electrical circuits, invented mathematical techniques for the solution of differential equations (equivalent to Laplace transforms), reformulated Maxwell's field equations in terms of electric and magnetic forces and energy flux, and independently co-formulated vector analysis.  Although at odds with the scientific establishment for most of his life, Heaviside changed the face of telecommunications, mathematics, and science for years to come.  BiographyEarly yearsHeaviside was born in Camden Town, London, at 55 Kings Street(now Plender Street). 

Book of Omni<====>22832<====>Book of Omni  The Book of Omni is one of the books that make up the Book of Mormon.  The book contains only one chapter although it covers more than two centuries of Nephite history (from ca 323 BC to 130 BC, according to footnotes). Stewardship of the metal platesNephi created a book of metal plates for engraving a record.  Omni is a descendant of Nephi and he receives the plates through his ancestors.  In turn he passes them to his son Amaron.   The plates then pass to Amaron's brother Chemish, then to Chemish's son Abinadom, and finally to Abinadom's son Amaleki ( ). 

Ozone layer<====>22834<====>Ozone layerThe ozone layer or ozone shield is a region of Earth's stratosphere that absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation.  It contains high concentrations of ozone (O 3 ) in relation to other parts of the atmosphere, although still small in relation to other gases in the stratosphere.  The ozone layer contains less than 10 parts per million of ozone, while the average ozone concentration in Earth's atmosphere as a whole is about 0. 3 parts per million.  The ozone layer is mainly found in the lower portion of the stratosphere, from approximately   above Earth, although its thickness varies seasonally and geographically. 

Public Enemy (band)<====>22841<====>Public Enemy (band) Public Enemy is an American hip hop group consisting of Chuck D, Flavor Flav, Professor Griff, Khari Wynn, DJ Lord, and the S1W group.  Formed on Long Island, New York, in 1986, they are known for their politically charged music and criticism of the American media, with an active interest in the frustrations and concerns of the African American community.  Their first four albums during the late 1980s and early 1990s were all certified either gold or platinum and were, according to music critic Robert Hilburn in 1998, "the most acclaimed body of work ever by a hip hop act". 

Paleolithic<====>22860<====>Paleolithic The Paleolithic (or "Palaeolithic")  age is a prehistoric period of human history distinguished by the development of the most primitive stone tools and covers roughly 95% of human technological prehistory.   It extends from the earliest known use of stone tools, probably by Homo habilis initially, 2. 6 million years ago, to the end of the Pleistocene around 10,000 BP.

Paramount Pictures<====>22918<====>Paramount Pictures   Paramount Pictures Corporation (also known simply as Paramount) is an American film studio based in Hollywood, California, that has been a subsidiary of the American media conglomerate Viacom since 1994.  Paramount is the fifth oldest surviving film studio in the world,    the second oldest in the United States, and the sole member of the "Big Six" film studios still located in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Hollywood.  In 1916, film producer Adolph Zukor put 22 actors and actresses under contract and honored each with a star on the logo.  These fortunate few would become the first "movie stars. 

Psychology<====>22921<====>Psychology Psychology is the science of behavior and mind, including conscious and unconscious phenomena, as well as thought.  It is an academic discipline of immense scope and diverse interests that, when taken together, seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, and all the variety of epiphenomena they manifest.  As a social science it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases.  Fernald LD (2008).  Psychology: Six perspectives (pp.  12–15).

PhpWiki<====>22923<====>PhpWiki PhpWiki is a web-based wiki software application. It began as a clone of WikiWikiWeb and was the first wiki written in PHP.    PhpWiki has been used to edit and format paper books for publication.    HistoryThe first version, by Steve Wainstead, was in December 1999 and was the first Wiki written in PHP to be publicly released. The first version ran under PHP 3. x and ran on DBM files only.  It was a feature-for-feature reimplementation of the original WikiWikiWeb at c2. com.  In early 2000 Arno Hollosi contributed a second database library to run PhpWiki on MySQL. 

Poetry<====>22926<====>PoetryPoetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, poiesis, "making") is a form of literature  that uses aesthetic and rhythmicqualities of language—such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning. Poetry has a long history, dating back to the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh.   Early poems evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. 

Probability<====>22934<====>Probability    Probability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur.   See glossary of probability and statistics.  Probability is quantified as a number between 0 and 1, where, loosely speaking,  0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty.  "Kendall's Advanced Theory of Statistics, Volume 1: Distribution Theory", Alan Stuart and Keith Ord, 6th Ed, (2009),    William Feller, "An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications", (Vol 1),  3rd Ed, (1968), Wiley,    The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur. 

Poland<====>22936<====>Poland   Poland (    ), officially the Republic of Poland ( ,    ), is a unitary sovereign state in Central Europe.It is divided into 16 administrative subdivisions, covering an area of   with a mostly temperate climate.   With a population of over 38. 5 million people, Poland is the sixth most populous member state of the European Union.   Poland's capital and largest city is Warsaw.  Other major cities include Kraków, Łódź, Wrocław, Poznań, Gdańsk and Szczecin. The establishment of a Polish state can be traced back to 966, when Mieszko I,  ruler of a territory roughly coextensive with that of present-day Poland, converted to Christianity. 

Performing arts<====>22938<====>Performing arts   Performing arts are a form of art in which artists use their voices or bodies, often in relation to other objects, to convey artistic expression.  It is different from visual arts, which is when artists use paint, canvas or various materials to create physical or static art objects.  Performing arts include several disciplines, each performed in front of a live audience. Theatre, music, dance, and other kinds of performances are present in all human cultures.  The history of music and dance date to pre-historic times.  More refined versions, such as ballet, opera, and Kabuki, are performed professionally. 

Physics<====>22939<====>PhysicsPhysics (from  , from   phýsis "nature"   ,  ,   ) is the natural science that involves the study of matter At the start of The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Richard Feynman offers the atomic hypothesis as the single most prolific scientific concept: "If, in some cataclysm, all [] scientific knowledge were to be destroyed [save] one sentence [. . . ] what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is [. . . ] that all things are made up of atoms – little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another . 

Papua New Guinea<====>22943<====>Papua New Guinea Papua New Guinea (PNG;  ,  ;   ; Hiri Motu: Papua Niu Gini), officially the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, is an Oceanian country that occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and its offshore islands in Melanesia, a region of the southwestern Pacific Ocean north of Australia.  Its capital, located along its southeastern coast, is Port Moresby.  The western half of New Guinea forms the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua. At the national level, after being ruled by three external powers since 1884, Papua New Guinea established its sovereignty in 1975.

Poseidon<====>22948<====>Poseidon  Poseidon ( ;   ,  ) was one of the Twelve Olympians in ancient Greek religion and myth.  He was god of the Sea and other waters; of earthquakes; and of horses.  Burkert 1985, pp.  136–139.   In pre-Olympian Bronze Age Greece, he was venerated as a chief deity at Pylos and Thebes.  Poseidon was protector of seafarers, and of many Hellenic cities and colonies.   In Homer's Iliad, Poseidon supports the Greeks against the Trojans during the Trojan War.  In the Odyssey, during the sea-voyage from Troy back home to Ithaca, the Greek hero Odysseus provokes Poseidon's fury by blinding his son the Cyclops Polyphemus, resulting in Poseidon punishing him with storms, the complete loss of his ship and companions, and a ten-year delay. 

Population<====>22949<====>Population  In biology, a population is all the organisms of the same group or species, which live in a particular geographical area, and have the capability of interbreeding.    The area that is used to define a sexual population is defined as the area where inter-breeding is potentially possible between any pair within the area, and where the probability of interbreeding is greater than the probability of cross-breeding with individuals from other areas.  In sociology, population refers to a collection of humans.  Demography is a social science which entails the statistical study of human populations. 

Psychological egoism<====>22951<====>Psychological egoism Psychological egoism is the view that humans are always motivated by self-interest, even in what seem to be acts of altruism.   It claims that, when people choose to help others, they do so ultimately because of the personal benefits that they themselves expect to obtain, directly or indirectly, from doing so.   This is a descriptive rather than normative view, since it only makes claims about how things are, not how they ought to be.   It is, however, related to several other normative forms of egoism, such as ethical egoism and rational egoism. 

Plato<====>22954<====>PlatoPlato ( ;   Greek:    Plátōn,   in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423  – 348/347 BC) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world.  He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition.   Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.   Others believe that the oldest extant manuscript dates to around AD 895, 1100 years after Plato's death. 

Sample space<====>22958<====>Sample space  In probability theory, the sample space  of an experiment or random trial is the set of all possible outcomes or results of that experiment.A sample space is usually denoted using set notation, and the possible ordered outcomes are listed as elements in the set.  It is common to refer to a sample space by the labels S, Ω, or U (for "universal set"). For example, if the experiment is tossing a coin, the sample space is typically the set {head, tail}.  For tossing two coins, the corresponding sample space would be {(head,head), (head,tail), (tail,head), (tail,tail)}, commonly written {HH, HT, TH, TT}. 

Elementary event<====>22960<====>Elementary event  In probability theory, an elementary event (also called an atomic event or simple event) is an event which contains only a single outcome in the sample space.   Using set theory terminology, an elementary event is a singleton.  Elementary events and their corresponding outcomes are often written interchangeably for simplicity, as such an event corresponds to precisely one outcome. The following are examples of elementary events:All sets {k}, where k ∈ N if objects are being counted and the sample space is S = {0, 1, 2, 3, . . . } (the natural numbers). {HH}, {HT}, {TH} and {TT} if a coin is tossed twice. 

Event (probability theory)<====>22961<====>Event (probability theory)  In probability theory, an event is a set of outcomes of an experiment (a subset of the sample space) to which a probability is assigned.   A single outcome may be an element of many different events,  and different events in an experiment are usually not equally likely, since they may include very different groups of outcomes.   An event defines a complementary event, namely the complementary set (the event not occurring), and together these define a Bernoulli trial: did the event occur or not?Typically, when the sample space is finite, any subset of the sample space is an event (i. 

Pig Latin<====>22973<====>Pig Latin    Pig Latin is a language game or argot in which words in English are altered, usually by adding a fabricated suffix or by moving the onset or initial consonant or consonant cluster of a word to the end of the word and adding a vocalic syllable to create such a suffix.  The objective is to conceal the words from others not familiar with the rules.  The reference to Latin is a deliberate misnomer; Pig Latin is simply a form of argot or jargon unrelated to Latin, and the name is used for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language. 

Polish language<====>22975<====>Polish language  Polish (język polski, polszczyzna) is a West Slavic language spoken primarily in Poland and is the native language of the Poles.  It belongs to the Lechitic subgroup of the West Slavic languages.   Polish is the official language of Poland, but it is also used throughout the world by Polish minorities in other countries.  There are over 55 million Polish language speakers around the world and it is one of the official languages of the European Union.  Its written standard is the Polish alphabet, which has 9 additions to the letters of the basic Latin script (ą, ć, ę, ł, ń, ó, ś, ź, ż). 

Pulp magazine<====>22977<====>Pulp magazine Pulp magazines or Pulp Fiction (often referred to as "the pulps") were inexpensive fiction magazines that were published from 1896 to the 1950s.  The term pulp derives from the cheap wood pulp paper on which the magazines were printed.  In contrast, magazines printed on higher-quality paper were called "glossies" or "slicks".  The typical pulp magazine had 128 pages; it was   wide by   high, and   thick, with ragged, untrimmed edges. The pulps gave rise to the term pulp fiction in reference to run-of-the-mill, low-quality literature.   Pulps were the successors to the penny dreadfuls, dime novels, and short-fiction magazines of the 19th century. 

Phoneme<====>22980<====>Phoneme    A phoneme ( ) is one of the units of sound (or gesture in the case of sign languages, see chereme) that distinguish one word from another in a particular language.  For example, in most dialects of English, the sound patterns   (thumb) and   (dumb) are two separate words distinguished by the substitution of one phoneme,  , for another phoneme,  .  (Two words like this that differ in meaning through a contrast of a single phoneme form what is called a minimal pair).  In many other languages these would be interpreted as exactly the same set of phonemes (i. 

Phone (phonetics)<====>22981<====>Phone (phonetics)  In phonetics and linguistics, a phone is any distinct speech sound or gesture, regardless of whether the exact sound is critical to the meanings of words.  In contrast, a phoneme is a speech sound that, in a given language, if it were swapped with another phoneme, would change the meaning of the word.  Phones are absolute, not specific to any language, but phonemes can be discussed only in reference to specific languages.  For example, the English words kid and kit end with two distinct phonemes, and swapping one for the other would change the word's meaning. 

Primate<====>22984<====>Primate   A primate (   ) is a mammal of the order Primates (Latin: "prime, first rank").    In taxonomy, primates include two distinct lineages, strepsirrhines and haplorhines.Primates arose from ancestors that lived in the trees of tropical forests; many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging three-dimensional environment.  Most primate species remain at least partly arboreal. With the exception of humans, who inhabit every continent,  most primates live in tropical or subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa and Asia.   They range in typical size from Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, which weighs only  , to the eastern gorilla, weighing over  . 

Politics<====>22986<====>Politics   Politics (from Greek: πολιτικα: Polis definition "affairs of the cities") is the process of making decisions that apply to  members of a group.  It refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state.  Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (this is usually a hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities. In most countries, people have formed political parties to put forward their ideas.  There is usually some disagreement between people within a party, but they work together because they feel that they agree on enough things, and they will have more power if they join together. 

Paris<====>22989<====>Paris Paris ( )  is the capital and most populous city in France, with an administrative-limits area of   and an official population of 2,206,488 (2015).    The city is a commune and department, and the heart of the   Île-de-France region (colloquially known as the 'Paris Region'), whose 2016 population of 12,142,802 represented roughly 18 percent of the population of France.Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's major centres of finance, commerce, fashion, science, and the arts.  The Paris Region had a GDP of €649. 

Postmaster<====>22990<====>Postmaster   A postmaster is the head of an individual post office.  When a postmaster is responsible for an entire mail distribution organization (usually sponsored by a national government), the title of Postmaster General is commonly used.  Responsibilities of a postmaster typically include management of a centralized mail distribution facility, establishment of letter carrier routes, supervision of letter carriers and clerks, and enforcement of the organization's rules and procedures.  In the United States, women have served as postmasters since the Revolutionary War and even earlier, under British rule. In Canada, many early places are named after the first postmaster. 

Postmaster General<====>22993<====>Postmaster GeneralA Postmaster General, in many countries, is the chief executive officer of the postal service of that country, responsible for oversight over all other Postmasters.  The practice of having a government official responsible for overseeing the delivery of mail throughout the nation originated in England, where a Master of the Posts is mentioned in the King's Book of Payments, with a payment of £100 being authorised for Tuke as master of the posts in February 1512.   Belatedly, in 1517, he was officially appointed to the office of Governor of the King's Posts, a precursor to the office of Postmaster General of the United Kingdom, by Henry VIII. 

Paul Cohen<====>22994<====>Paul CohenFor other people named Paul Cohen, see Paul Cohen (disambiguation).  Not to be confused with Paul Cohn.  Paul Joseph Cohen (April 2, 1934 – March 23, 2007)    was an American mathematician.  He is best known for his proofs that the continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice  are independent from Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, for which he was awarded a Fields Medal.  Early yearsCohen was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, into a Jewish family that had immigrated to the United States from what is now Poland; he grew up in Brooklyn. 

Patti Smith<====>22995<====>Patti Smith   Patricia Lee Smith (born December 30, 1946)    is an American singer-songwriter, poet, and visual artist who became an influential component of the New York City punk rock movement with her 1975 debut album Horses.    Called the "punk poet laureate", Smith fused rock and poetry in her work.  Her most widely known song is "Because the Night", which was co-written with Bruce Springsteen.  It reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1978.   In 2005, Smith was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture. 

Horses (album)<====>22996<====>Horses (album) Horses is the debut studio album by American musician Patti Smith, released on December 13, 1975, on Arista Records.  Smith, a fixture of the then-burgeoning New York punk rock music scene, began recording Horses with her band in 1975 after being signed to Arista Records, with John Cale being enlisted to produce the album.  With its fusion of simplistic rock and roll structures and Smith's freeform, Beat poetry-infused lyrics, Horses was met with widespread critical acclaim upon its initial release.  Despite a lack of airplay or a popular single to support the album, it nonetheless experienced modest commercial success, managing a top 50 placing on the US Billboard 200. 

Panama<====>22997<====>PanamaPanama (   ;    ), officially called the Republic of Panama ( ), is a country in Central America.   It is bordered by Costa Rica to the west, Colombia (in South America) to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south.  The capital and largest city is Panama City, whose metropolitan area is home to nearly half of the country's Expression error: Unrecognised punctuation character: "{" million people.  Panama was inhabited by several indigenous tribes prior to settlement by the Spanish in the 16th century. 

Polynomial<====>23000<====>PolynomialIn mathematics, a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (also called indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents of variables.  An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate   is  .  An example in three variables is  . Polynomials appear in a wide variety of areas of mathematics and science.  For example, they are used to form polynomial equations, which encode a wide range of problems, from elementary word problems to complicated problems in the sciences; they are used to define polynomial functions, which appear in settings ranging from basic chemistry and physics to economics and social science; they are used in calculus and numerical analysis to approximate other functions. 

Polymer<====>23001<====>Polymer  A polymer ( ;   Greek  , "many" +  , "parts") is a large molecule, or macromolecule, composed of many repeated subunits.  Because of their broad range of properties,    both synthetic and natural polymers play essential and ubiquitous roles in everyday life.Polymers range from familiar synthetic plastics such as polystyrene to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins that are fundamental to biological structure and function.  Polymers, both natural and synthetic, are created via polymerization of many small molecules, known as monomers.  Their consequently large molecular mass relative to small molecule compounds produces unique physical properties, including toughness, viscoelasticity, and a tendency to form glasses and semicrystalline structures rather than crystals. 

Perfect competition<====>23002<====>Perfect competition In economics, specifically general equilibrium theory, a perfect market is defined by several idealizing conditions, collectively called perfect competition.  In theoretical models where conditions of perfect competition hold, it has been theoretically demonstrated that a market will reach an equilibrium in which the quantity supplied for every product or service, including labor, equals the quantity demanded at the current price.  This equilibrium will be a Pareto optimum, meaning that nobody can be made better off by exchange without making someone else worse off.  Perfect competition provides both allocative efficiency and productive efficiency:Such markets are allocatively efficient, as output will always occur where marginal cost is equal to marginal revenue (MC = MR). 

Philosophy of religion<====>23003<====>Philosophy of religion Philosophy of religion is "the philosophical examination of the central themes and concepts involved in religious traditions. "    These sorts of philosophical discussion are ancient, and can be found in the earliest known manuscripts concerning philosophy.  The field is related to many other branches of philosophy, including metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics.  The philosophy of religion differs from religious philosophy in that it seeks to discuss questions regarding the nature of religion as a whole, rather than examining the problems brought forth by a particular belief system.  It is designed such that it can be carried out dispassionately by those who identify as believers or non-believers. 

Precedent<====>23004<====>Precedent In legal systems based on common law, a precedent, or authority, is a principle or rule established in a previous legal case that is either binding on or persuasive for a court or other tribunal when deciding subsequent cases with similar issues or facts  .  Common law legal systems place great value on deciding cases according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar and predictable outcomes, and observance of precedent is the mechanism by which that goal is attained.  The principle by which judges are bound to precedents is known as stare decisis. 

Philip K. Dick<====>23005<====>Philip K.  Dick  Philip Kindred Dick (December 16, 1928 – March 2, 1982) was an American science fiction writer.  Dick explored philosophical, social, and political themes in his novels with plots dominated by monopolistic corporations, alternative universes, authoritarian governments, and altered states of consciousness.  His work reflected his personal interest in metaphysics and theology, and often drew upon his life experiences in addressing the nature of reality, identity, drug abuse, schizophrenia, and transcendental experiences. Born in Illinois before moving to California, Dick began publishing science fiction stories in the 1950s, initially finding little commercial success.His 1962 alternative history novel The Man in the High Castle earned Dick early acclaim, including a Hugo Award for Best Novel. 

Penélope Cruz<====>23006<====>Penélope CruzPenélope Cruz Sánchez ( ; born 28 April 1974)    is a Spanish actress and model.  Signed by an agent at age 15, she made her acting debut at 16 on television and her feature film debut the following year in Jamón Jamón (1992)  to critical acclaim.  Her subsequent roles in the 1990s and 2000s included Open Your Eyes (1997), The Hi-Lo Country (1999), The Girl of Your Dreams (2000) and Woman on Top (2000).  Cruz achieved recognition for her lead roles in the 2001 films Vanilla Sky, All the Pretty Horses, Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Blow. 

Preliminary hearing<====>23008<====>Preliminary hearingWithin some criminal justice systems, a preliminary hearing, preliminary examination, evidentiary hearing or probable cause hearing is a proceeding, after a criminal complaint has been filed by the prosecutor, to determine whether there is enough evidence to require a trial.  At such a hearing, the defendant may be assisted by counsel. ScotlandIn Scotland, a preliminary hearing is a non-evidential diet in cases to be tried before the High Court of Justiciary.  It is a pre-trial diet to enable the court to be advised whether both parties, the prosecution and the defence, are ready to proceed to trial and may also deal with ancillary procedural matters. 

Paul Ehrlich<====>23010<====>Paul Ehrlich   Paul Ehrlich ( ; 14 March 1854 – 20 August 1915) was a German Jewish physician and scientist who worked in the fields of hematology, immunology, and antimicrobial chemotherapy.  He invented the precursor technique to Gram staining bacteria.   The methods he developed for staining tissue made it possible to distinguish between different types of blood cells, which led to the capability to diagnose numerous blood diseases. His laboratory discovered arsphenamine (Salvarsan), the first effective medicinal treatment for syphilis, thereby initiating and also naming the concept of chemotherapy.  Ehrlich popularized the concept of a magic bullet. 

Philosophical methodology<====>23012<====>Philosophical methodology  Philosophical method (or philosophical methodology) is the study of how to do philosophy.  A common view among philosophers is that philosophy is distinguished by the ways that philosophers follow in addressing philosophical questions.  There is not just one method that philosophers use to answer philosophical questions. Overview Systematic philosophy  attempts to provide a framework in reason that can explain all questions and problems related to human life.  Examples of systematic philosophers include Plato, The Ammonius Foundation  Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, and Hegel.  In many ways, any attempts to formulate a philosophical method that provides the ultimate constituents of reality, a metaphysics, can be considered systematic philosophy. 

Punch and Judy<====>23013<====>Punch and Judy   Punch and Judy is a traditional, popular, and usually violent puppet show featuring Pulcinella (Mr.  Punch) and his wife Judy.  The performance consists of a sequence of short scenes, each depicting an interaction between two characters, most typically Mr.  Punch and one other character who usually falls victim to Judy's club.  It is often associated with traditional British seaside culture.   The various episodes of Punch and Judy are performed in the spirit of outrageous comedy—often provoking shocked laughter—and are dominated by the clowning of Mr.  Punch.    The show is performed by a single puppeteer inside the booth, known since Victorian times as a "professor" or "punchman", and assisted sometimes by a "bottler" who corrals the audience outside the booth, introduces the performance, and collects the money ("the bottle"). 

Poker<====>23014<====>Poker  Poker is a family of card games that combines gambling, strategy, and skill.  All poker variants involve betting as an intrinsic part of play, and determine the winner of each hand according to the combinations of players' cards, at least some of which remain hidden until the end of the hand.  Poker games vary in the number of cards dealt, the number of shared or "community" cards, the number of cards that remain hidden, and the betting procedures. In most modern poker games, the first round of betting begins with one or more of the players making some form of a forced bet (the blind or ante). 

Programming language<====>23015<====>Programming language  A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.  Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer.  Programming languages can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms. The earliest known programmable machine that preceded the invention of the digital computer was the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the Islamic Golden Age.    From the early 1800s, "programs" were used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms and player pianos. 

Economy of Poland<====>23019<====>Economy of Poland  The economy of Poland is the eighth largest economy in the European Union and the largest among the former Eastern Bloc members of the European Union.   Since 1990 Poland has pursued a policy of economic liberalization and its economy was the only one in the EU to avoid a recession through the 2007-2008 economic downturn.   In all, as of 2017 the Polish economy has been growing steadily for the past 26 years, a record high in the EU.  Such growth has been exponential, with GDP per capita at purchasing power parity growing on average by 6% p.

Transport in Poland<====>23022<====>Transport in Poland Transport in Poland involves air, water, road and rail transportation.  The country has a large network of municipal public transport, such as buses, trams and the metro.  As a country located at the 'cross-roads' of Europe, Poland, with its highly developed economy, is a nation with a large and increasingly modern network of transport infrastructure. The country's most important waterway is the river Vistula.  The largest seaports are the Port of Szczecin and Port of Gdańsk.  Air travel is generally used for international travel, with many flights originating at Warsaw Chopin Airport.

Foreign relations of Poland<====>23024<====>Foreign relations of Poland  The Republic of Poland is a Central European country and member of the European Union and NATO, among others.  In recent years, despite its occasional but obstinate relations with Russia during the 20th century, Poland has extended its responsibilities and position in European and Western affairs, supporting and establishing friendly foreign relations with both the West and with numerous European countries. Integration with the West and EuropeAfter regaining independence in 1989, Poland has forged ahead on its economic reintegration with the Western world.Poland also has been an active nation in advocating European integration. 

Media of Poland<====>23028<====>Media of Poland The Media of Poland consist of several different types of communications media including television, radio, cinema, newspapers, magazines, and Internet.  During the communist regime in Poland the Stalinist press doctrine dominated and controlled Polish media.The country instituted freedom of press since the fall of communism.  The Polish media system's main features are the product of the country's socio-political and economic post-communist transition.  These features include: the privatisation of the press sector; the transformation of the state radio and television into public broadcasting services; influx of foreign capital into the media market and European integration of audiovisual media policies. 

Portugal<====>23033<====>Portugal   Portugal (Portuguese:  ), officially the Portuguese Republic (   ), In recognized minority languages of Portugal:   is a sovereign state located mostly on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe.  It is the westernmost country of mainland Europe, being bordered to the west and south by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north and east by Spain.  Its territory also includes the Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira, both autonomous regions with their own regional governments.  At 1. 7 million km 2 , its Exclusive Economic Zone is the 3rd largest in the European Union and the 11th largest in the world. 

Piano<====>23034<====>PianoThe piano is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 (the exact year is uncertain), in which the strings are struck by hammers.  It is played using a keyboard,  which is a row of keys (small levers) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings.  The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte, the Italian term for the early 1700s versions of the instrument,  which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte Pollens (1995, 238)  and fortepiano.

Punk rock<====>23037<====>Punk rock   Punk rock (or "punk") is a rock music genre that developed in the mid-1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia.  Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as "proto-punk" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock.  Punk bands typically produced short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics.  Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through independent record labels and other informal channels. The term "punk rock" was first used by certain American rock critics in the early 1970s to describe 1960s garage bands and subsequent acts then perceived as stylistic inheritors. 

Political philosophy<====>23040<====>Political philosophy   Political philosophy, or political theory, is the study of topics such as politics, liberty, justice, property, rights, law, and the enforcement of a laws by authority: what they are, why (or even if) they are needed, what, if anything, makes a government legitimate, what rights and freedoms it should protect and why, what form it should take and why, what the law is, and what duties citizens owe to a legitimate government, if any, and when it may be legitimately overthrown, if ever. In a vernacular sense, the term "political philosophy" often refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, about politics, synonymous to the term "political ideology". 

Puerto Rico<====>23041<====>Puerto Rico  Puerto Rico  (Spanish for "Rich Port"), officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (  ,   "Free Associated State of Puerto Rico")  and briefly called Porto Rico,is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea. An archipelago among the Greater Antilles, Puerto Rico includes the main island of Puerto Rico and a number of smaller ones, such as Mona, Culebra, and Vieques.  The capital and most populous city is San Juan.  Its official languages are Spanish and English, though Spanish predominates. 

Pseudoscience<====>23047<====>Pseudoscience    Pseudoscience consists of statements, beliefs, or practices that are claimed to be scientific and factual, in the absence of evidence gathered and constrained by appropriate scientific methods.   Pseudoscience is often characterized by contradictory, exaggerated or unfalsifiable claims; reliance on confirmation bias rather than rigorous attempts at refutation; lack of openness to evaluation by other experts; and absence of systematic practices when developing theories.  The term pseudoscience is often considered pejorative    because it suggests something is being presented as science inaccurately or even deceptively.  Those described as practicing or advocating pseudoscience often dispute the characterization. 

Prion<====>23048<====>Prion  Prions are infectious agents composed entirely of a protein material that can fold in multiple, structurally abstract ways, at least one of which is transmissible to other prion proteins, leading to disease in a manner that is epidemiologically comparable to the spread of viral infection.  Prions composed of the prion protein (PrP) are believed to be the cause of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) among other diseases.  Prions were initially identified as the causative agent in animal TSEs derived from scrapie in sheep and later bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)—known popularly as "mad cow disease".   Human prion diseases include Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) and its variant (vCJD), Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia, and kuru. 

Periodic table<====>23053<====>Periodic table   The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements, ordered by their atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties.  This ordering shows periodic trends, such as elements with similar behaviour in the same column.  It also shows four rectangular blocks with some approximately similar chemical properties.  In general, within one row (period) the elements are metals on the left, and non-metals on the right. The rows of the table are called periods; the columns are called groups.  Six groups have generally accepted names as well as numbers: for example, group 17 elements are the halogens; and group 18 are the noble gases. 

Potassium<====>23055<====>Potassium  Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K (from Neo-Latin  ) and atomic number 19.  It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives.  In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals.  All of the alkali metals have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge – a cation, which combines with anions to form salts.  Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts.  Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac-colored flame. 

Pope<====>23056<====>Pope  The pope (  from   pappas,  a child's word for "father"),  also known as the supreme pontiff (from Latin pontifex maximus "greatest bridge-builder"), is the Bishop of Rome, and therefore ex officio the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church.The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the supposed apostolic successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is said to have given the Keys of Heaven and the powers of "binding and loosing", naming him as the "rock" upon which the church would be built. 

Passover<====>23059<====>Passover   Passover or Pesach ( ;  from Hebrew    Pesah, Pesakh), is an important, biblically derived Jewish holiday.  Jews celebrate Passover as a commemoration of their liberation by God from slavery in ancient Egypt  and their freedom as a nation under the leadership of Moses.  It commemorates the story of the Exodus as described in the Hebrew Bible, especially in the Book of Exodus, in which the Israelites were freed from slavery in Egypt.  According to standard biblical chronology, this event would have taken place at about 1300 BCE (AM 2450). 

Post Office Protocol<====>23062<====>Post Office Protocol  In computing, the Post Office Protocol (POP) is an application-layer Internet standard protocol used by local e-mail clients to retrieve e-mail from a remote server over a TCP/IP connection.POP has been developed through several versions, with version 3 (POP3) being the last standard in common use before largely being made obsolete by the more advanced IMAP as well as webmail. OverviewPOP supports download-and-delete requirements for access to remote mailboxes (termed maildrop in the POP RFC's).Although most POP clients have an option to leave mail on server after download, e-mail clients using POP generally connect, retrieve all messages, store them on the user's PC as new messages, delete them from the server, and then disconnect. 

Punch (magazine)<====>23069<====>Punch (magazine)    Punch; or, The London Charivari was a British weekly magazine of humour and satire established in 1841 by Henry Mayhew and engraver Ebenezer Landells.  Historically, it was most influential in the 1840s and 1850s, when it helped to coin the term "cartoon" in its modern sense as a humorous illustration.   After the 1940s, when its circulation peaked, it went into a long decline, closing in 1992.  It was revived in 1996, but closed again in 2002. HistoryPunch was founded on 17 July 1841 by Henry Mayhew and engraver Ebenezer Landells, on an initial investment of £25. 

Pacific Ocean<====>23070<====>Pacific Ocean The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth's oceanic divisions.  It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. At   in area (as defined with an Antarctic southern border), this largest division of the World Ocean—and, in turn, the hydrosphere—covers about 86% of Earth's water surface and about one-third of its total surface area, making it larger than all of Earth's land area combined. 

Prince Edward Island<====>23071<====>Prince Edward Island    Prince Edward Island (PEI or P. E. I. ;  ) is a province of Canada consisting of the island of the same name, as well as several much smaller islands.  Prince Edward Island is one of the three Maritime Provinces and is the smallest province in both land area and population.  It is part of the traditional lands of the Mi'kmaq, and became a British colony in the 1700s and was federated into Canada as a province in 1873.  Its capital is Charlottetown.  According to the 2016 census, the province of Prince Edward Island has 142,907 residents. 

Pretty Good Privacy<====>23080<====>Pretty Good Privacy  Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication.  PGP is used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications.  Phil Zimmermann developed PGP in 1991.    PGP and similar software follow the OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880) for encrypting and decrypting data. DesignPGP encryption uses a serial combination of hashing, data compression, symmetric-key cryptography, and finally public-key cryptography; each step uses one of several supported algorithms.  Each public key is bound to a user name or an e-mail address. 

Playing card<====>23083<====>Playing card A playing card is a piece of specially prepared heavy paper, thin cardboard, plastic-coated paper, cotton-paper blend, or thin plastic, marked with distinguishing motifs and used as one of a set for playing card games.  Playing cards are typically palm-sized for convenient handling, and were first invented in China during the Tang dynasty.  HistoryEarly history Playing cards may have been invented during the Tang dynasty around the 9th century AD as a result of the usage of woodblock printing technology and there were 30 cards in a deck.   .    The first possible reference to card games comes from a 9th-century text known as the Collection of Miscellanea at Duyang, written by Tang dynasty writer Su E. 

Paleontology<====>23084<====>Paleontology  Paleontology or palaeontology ( ) is the scientific study of life that existed prior to, and sometimes including, the start of the Holocene Epoch (roughly 11,700 years before present).  It includes the study of fossils to determine organisms' evolution and interactions with each other and their environments (their paleoecology).   Paleontological observations have been documented as far back as the 5th century BC.  The science became established in the 18th century as a result of Georges Cuvier's work on  comparative anatomy, and developed rapidly in the 19th century.  The term itself originates from Greek παλαιός, palaios, "old, ancient", ὄν, on  (gen. 

Plotter<====>23085<====>Plotter The plotter is a computer printer for printing vector graphics.   In the past, plotters were used in applications such as computer-aided design, though they have generally been replaced with wide-format conventional printers.  A plotter gives a hard copy of the output.  It draws pictures on a  paper using a pen.  Plotters are used to print designs of ships and machines, plans for buildings and so on.  OverviewDigitally controlled plotters evolved from earlier fully analog XY-writers used as output devices for measurement instruments and analog computers.  Pen plotters print by moving a pen or other instrument across the surface of a piece of paper. 

Poker equipment<====>23086<====>Poker equipment The following is a list of equipment used for a game of poker:Cards: Standard playing cards are used.   In home games it is common to have two decks with distinct backs, and to shuffle the unused deck while each hand is in progress.   Casinos typically change decks every few hours, to limit the wear of the cards.  It is not unusual for paper cards to become bent quickly, as players often read their "hole" cards by peeking at the corner rather than lifting the card.  Card quality can be preserved for longer if players agree not to bend cards, and proper shuffling techniques are used. 

Bug (poker)<====>23093<====>Bug (poker) A bug in poker is a limited form of wild card.   One or both jokers are often added to the deck and played as bugs. In draw poker played for high and pai gow poker, the bug is considered to be an ace, unless it can be used as a missing card to complete a straight or a flush, in which case it becomes the highest card which can complete the hand. K-K-Joker-5-2 is a pair of kings with an ace kicker. A-A-Joker-9-4 is three aces.  A♥ J♥ 8♥ 3♥  Joker is a flush, ace-king high, the bug becoming the  K♥ , even if another player holds the "real"  K♥ . 

Wild card (card games)<====>23094<====>Wild card (card games) Card games, particularly poker games, may contain one or more cards designated as wild.   These may be jokers, or they may be normal ranked and suited cards pressed into wild card duty ("deuces wild" is a common variant).  In most cases, the wild card or cards must be agreed upon by all players before the cards are dealt and play commences.  There are two common rules regarding wild cards: "fully wild" cards and the "bug". A card that is fully wild can be designated by its holder as any card they choose with no restrictions. 

High-low split<====>23101<====>High-low split  In traditional poker games, the player with the best traditional hand wins the whole pot.   Lowball variations award the pot to the lowest hand, by any of several methods (see Low hand (poker)).   High-low split games are those in which the pot is divided between the player with the best traditional hand (called the high hand) and the player with the low hand.  Zee, Ray (1992).  High-Low-Split Poker, Seven-Card Stud and Omaha Eight-or-better for Advanced Players.  Two Plus Two Pub. ; 2nd edition,    There are two common methods for playing high-low split games, called declaration and cards speak. 

Kicker (poker)<====>23106<====>Kicker (poker)A kicker, also called a side card, is a card in a poker hand that does not itself take part in determining the rank of the hand, but that may be used to break ties between hands of the same rank.   For example, the hand Q-Q-10-5-2 is ranked as a pair of queens.   The 10, 5, and 2 are kickers.   This hand would defeat any hand with no pair, or with a lower-ranking pair, and lose to any higher-ranking hand.   But the kickers can be used to break ties between other hands that also have a pair of queens. 

Blind (poker)<====>23124<====>Blind (poker) The blinds are forced bets posted by players to the left of the dealer button in flop-style poker games.  The number of blinds is usually two, but it can range from none to three. The small blind is placed by the player to the left of the dealer button and the big blind is then posted by the next player to the left.   The one exception is when there are only two players (a "heads-up" game), when the player on the button is the small blind, and the other player is the big blind.  (Both the player and the bet may be referred to as big or small blind. 

Showdown (poker)<====>23128<====>Showdown (poker)In poker, the showdown is a situation when, if more than one player remains after the last betting round, remaining players expose and compare their hands to determine the winner or winners. To win any part of a pot if more than one player has a hand, a player must show all of his cards faceup on the table, whether they were used in the final hand played or not.  Cards speak for themselves: the actual value of a player's hand prevails in the event a player mis-states the value of his hand.  Because exposing a losing hand gives information to an opponent, players may be reluctant to expose their hands until after their opponents have done so and will muck their losing hands without exposing them. 

Check-raise<====>23134<====>Check-raiseA check-raise in poker is a common deceptive play in which a player checks early in a betting round, hoping someone else will open.   The player who checked then raises in the same round. This might be done, for example, when the first player believes that an opponent has an inferior hand and will not call a direct bet, but that they may attempt to bluff, allowing the first player to win more money than they would by betting straightforwardly.  The key point is that if no one else is keen to bet, then the most a player can raise by (in a limit game) is one single bet. 

Twist (poker)<====>23144<====>Twist (poker)Twist is poker jargon for a round with specific rules which is sometimes used in the poker variant stud poker.  One can replace any round of (or add a round to) a stud poker game with a twist round, in which each player is offered the option to replace exactly one card in his hand with a new one from the remaining deck stub. This is similar to the draw phase of draw poker, differing in the following way: if the player chooses to replace a downcard, he discards it and is dealt a replacement card also face down; if he wishes to replace an upcard, he discards it and receives the replacement face up. 

Stripped deck<====>23145<====>Stripped deck A stripped deck (US) or shortened pack (UK) is a set of playing cards from which some cards have been removed.  The removed cards are usually the pip cards.  Many card games use stripped decks, and stripped decks for popular games are commercially available. HistoryWhen playing cards first arrived in Europe during the 1370s, they had the same format as the modern standard 52-card deck, consisting of four suits each with ten pip cards and three face cards.  During the late 14th and 15th centuries, the Spanish and Portuguese decks dropped the 10s while the German and Swiss packs removed the Aces to create 48-card decks. 

Roll-your-own cigarette<====>23146<====>Roll-your-own cigarette   Roll-your-own cigarettes (also called RYO, MYO, rollies, roll-ups, burns, hand-rolled cigarettes, or simply rolls) refer to cigarettes made from loose tobacco and rolling paper.  Roll-your-own products are sold in pouches or as tins of tobacco, sometimes including the rolling papers or cigarette tubes.  Loose filters are available for purchase and can be added to the rolled cigarettes.  Some people use a machine to assist them and some people use pre-rolled cones or cigarette tubes. Hand-rolled cigarettes give smokers the ability to roll cigarettes of any diameter, thereby varying the strength of the cigarette. 

Rollout (poker)<====>23147<====>Rollout (poker) Rollout or roll 'em out is poker jargon used for a game phase in certain poker variants.  It is often incorrectly called "roll your own", to which it has similarities but from which it is fundamentally different. Poker games with a rollout phase resemble stud poker but have significantly different strategies, because players generally receive all of their cards up front (sometimes with a draw phase), and know the final value of their hand in early betting rounds.  They resemble stud poker only in that cards are revealed to other players one at a time for each betting round. 

One player to a hand<====>23149<====>One player to a handOne player to a hand is an important poker rule designed to promote fair play that is universally applied in casino play.   It states that all game decisions about the play of each hand must be made by one player without any assistance.   This means, for example, that a player may not ask for advice from any other player or non-player during the play of the hand, nor should anyone offer such advice.    The phrase is often used as a warning to players making what might be perceived as minor violations, such as commenting upon other players' possible hands. 

Cards speak<====>23150<====>Cards speakCards speak ("for themselves"), also known as "cards read" is used in two poker contexts:First, it is used to describe a high-low split game without a declaration.  That is, in a cards speak game, players all reveal their hands at the showdown, and whoever has the highest hand wins the high half of the pot and whoever has the lowest hand wins the low half.  The second is as a house rule in casino cardrooms.  "Cards speak" means that any verbal declaration as to the content of a player’s hand is not binding.  If Mary says she has no pair, but in fact she has a flush, her cards speak and her hand is viewed for its genuine value, that of a flush. 

Declaration (poker)<====>23151<====>Declaration (poker) There are several actions in poker called declaration, in which a player formally expresses his intent to take some action (which he may perform at a later point). For example, one may verbally declare an action (fold, call, raise) while in turn, which obligates the player to complete that action. One may declare a number of cards to draw in a draw poker game (which is typically not binding), or one may declare some other choice specific to the variant being played. But most commonly, the term refers to the declaration in the final phase of a high-low split game, in which players indicate whether their hands are to be evaluated as high hands, low hands, or both at showdown. 

Closed (poker)<====>23153<====>Closed (poker) In the game of poker, a betting round is said to be closed if no player will have the right to raise in the round.   Normally this occurs when a player calls, and the next player whose turn it is to act is the one who made the last raise, so he cannot raise further (this ends the betting round).   The round can also said to be closed before it has actually ended if there are still players remaining to act, but they will not be entitled to raise either because the last raise was a sub-minimum all-in raise (see poker table stakes rules) or because the limit ("cap") on allowed raises has been reached. 

Value (poker)<====>23157<====>Value (poker)In poker, the strength of a hand (how likely it is to be the best according to the rules of the game being played) is often called its value; however, in the context of poker strategy the term is more often used to describe a betting tactic, a bet for value.   This bet (or raise) is intended to increase the size of the pot, by inducing opponents to call.   A bet for value is in contrast to a bluff or a protection bet (though some bets may have a combination of these motives). For a bet for value to be correct, a player must have a positive expectation, that is, he will win more than one bet for every bet he puts in the pot. 

Nut hand<====>23158<====>Nut hand In poker, the nut hand is the strongest possible hand in a given situation.  The second-nut hand or third-nut hand (and so on) may refer to the second and third best possible hands.  The term applies mostly to community card poker games where the individual holding the strongest possible hand, with the given board of community cards, is capable of knowing that they have the nut hand. Usage in contextIn Texas hold 'em, if the board is 5♠ 6♠ A♣ 9♠  5♥ , a player holding 7♠ 8♠ has the nut hand because those hole cards complete a 9-high straight flush of spades, which cannot be beaten by any other possible combination of hole cards and community cards. 

Protection (poker)<====>23159<====>Protection (poker) Protection in poker is a bet made with a strong but vulnerable hand, such as top pair when straight or flush draws are possible.  The bet forces opponents with draws to either call with insufficient pot odds, or to fold, both of which are profitable for the betting player.  By contrast, if he failed to protect his hand, another player could draw out on him at no cost, meaning he gets no value from his made hand. A protection play differs from a bluff in that the bluff can win only when the opponent folds, while protection bet is made with a hand that is likely to win a showdown, but isn't strong enough for slow playing. 

Draw (poker)<====>23160<====>Draw (poker)  A poker player is drawing if they have a hand that is incomplete and needs further cards to become valuable.  The hand itself is called a draw or drawing hand.  For example, in seven-card stud, if four of a player's first five cards are all spades, but the hand is otherwise weak, they are drawing to a flush.  In contrast, a made hand already has value and does not necessarily need to draw to win.  A made starting hand with no help can lose to an inferior starting hand with a favorable draw. 

Made hand<====>23161<====>Made hand

Out (poker)<====>23162<====>Out (poker) In a poker game with more than one betting round, an out is  any unseen card that, if drawn, will improve a player's hand to one that is likely to win.  Knowing the number of outs a player has is an important part of poker strategy.  For example, in draw poker, a hand with four diamonds has nine outs to make a flush: there are 13 diamonds in the deck, and four of them have been seen.  If a player has two small pairs, and he believes that it will be necessary for him to make a full house to win, then he has four outs: the two remaining cards of each rank that he holds. 

Pot odds<====>23163<====>Pot odds In poker, pot odds are the ratio of the current size of the pot to the cost of a contemplated call.   Pot odds are often compared to the probability of winning a hand with a future card in order to estimate the call's expected value. Converting odds ratios to and from percentagesOdds are most commonly expressed as ratios, but converting them to percentages will often make them easier to work with.  The ratio has two numbers: the size of the pot and the cost of the call.  To convert this ratio to the equivalent percentage, we add these two numbers together and then divide the cost of the call by this sum. 

Position (poker)<====>23165<====>Position (poker)Position in poker refers to the order in which players are seated around the table and the related poker strategy implications.  Players who act first are in "early position"; players who act later are in "late position"; players who act in between are in "middle position".A player "has position" on opponents acting before him and is "out of position" to opponents acting after him.Because players act in clockwise order, a player "has position" on opponents seated to his right, except when the opponent has the button and certain cases in the first betting round of games with blinds. 

Steal (poker)<====>23166<====>Steal (poker) In poker, a steal is a type of a bluff, a raise during the first betting round made with an inferior hand and meant to make other players fold superior hands because of shown strength.  A steal is normally either an "ante steal" or "blind steal" (depending on whether the game being played uses antes or blinds). Steals are done with hands less valuable than what might normally be considered a raising hand, normally a below average one, with the hope that the few players remaining will not have a hand worth calling the raise, thereby winning the antes or blinds without further action. 

Dead money (poker)<====>23169<====>Dead money (poker) In poker, dead money is the amount of money in the pot other than the equal amounts bet by active remaining players in that pot.  Examples of dead money include money contributed to the pot by players who have folded, a dead blind posted by a player returning to a game after missing blinds, or an odd chip left in the pot from a previous deal.  For example, eight players each ante $1, one player opens for $2, and gets two callers, making the pot total $14.  Three players are now in the pot having contributed $3 each, for $9 "live" money; the remaining $5 (representing the antes of the players who folded) is dead money. 

Isolation (poker)<====>23170<====>Isolation (poker) In poker, an isolation play is usually a raise designed to encourage one or more players to fold, specifically for the purpose of making the hand a one-on-one contest with a specific opponent.  For example, if an opponent raises and a player suspects he is holding a weak, but playable hand, they may reraise to pressure other opponents to fold, with the aim of getting heads up with the opening raiser. Isolation plays are most common against overly-aggressive players ("maniacs") who frequently play inferior hands, or with players who may have a drawing hand.  Isolation plays are also common in tournaments to isolate a player who is "short stacked", that is, one who is in imminent danger of elimination, and so is likely to be playing aggressively out of desperation. 

Freeroll<====>23172<====>Freeroll In poker, a freeroll has two distinct meanings.  One applies to the play of a single hand, and the other describes an entire poker tournament. Freeroll handIn playing a particular hand of poker, a freeroll is a situation that arises (usually when only two players remain) before the last card has been dealt, in which one player is guaranteed to at least split the pot with his opponent no matter what the final cards are, but where there is some chance he can win the whole pot if certain final cards are dealt.   This most commonly occurs in a high-low split game where one player knows that he has a guaranteed low hand made, his opponent cannot make a better low no matter what the last card is, but the player who is low might possibly catch a lucky card that gives him a straight or flush, winning high as well. 

Starting hand<====>23173<====>Starting hand  In poker, the starting hand is the initial set of cards dealt to each player before any voluntary betting takes place.  For example, in seven-card stud this is two downcards and one upcard; in Texas hold 'em it is two downcards; in five-card draw it is five cards. The one decision made by every poker player on every deal of every game is whether to continue playing that hand after seeing that first set of cards.   Since making this decision correctly will lead to the most long-run profit for a skilled player, players often put considerable study into what the appropriate starting hand "standards" are for the game being played. 

Omaha hold 'em<====>23174<====>Omaha hold 'em  Omaha hold 'em (also known as Omaha holdem or simply Omaha) is a community card poker game similar to Texas hold 'em, where each player is dealt four cards and must make his or her best hand using exactly two of them, plus exactly three of the five community cards.  The exact origin of the game is unknown, but casino executive Robert Turner first brought Omaha into a casino setting  when he introduced the game to Bill Boyd, who offered it as a game at the Las Vegas Golden Nugget Casino (calling it "Nugget Hold'em"). 

Aggression (poker)<====>23184<====>Aggression (poker) In the game of poker, opens and raises are considered aggressive plays, while calls and checks are considered passive (though a check-raise would be considered a very aggressive play).  It is said  that "aggression has its own value", meaning that often aggressive plays can make money with weak hands because of bluff value.  In general, opponents must respond to aggressive play by playing more loosely, which offers more opportunities to make mistakes. While it is true that aggressive play is generally superior to passive play, using any play exclusively can lead to predictability.  A player who is constantly aggressive and plays many inferior hands is called a "maniac", and skilled players will take advantage of him by calling him more often, using isolation plays, and by other means. 

Shuffling<====>23189<====>Shuffling Shuffling is a procedure used to randomize a deck of playing cards to provide an element of chance in card games.  Shuffling is often followed by a cut, to help ensure that the shuffler has not manipulated the outcome. Shuffling techniquesOverhand shuffleOne of the easiest shuffles to accomplish after a little practice is the overhand shuffle.  Johan Jonasson wrote, "The overhand shuffle. . .  is the shuffling technique where you gradually transfer the deck from, say, your right hand to your left hand by sliding off small packets from the top of the deck. "  In detail as normally performed, with the pack initially held in the left hand (say), most of the cards are grasped as a group from the bottom of the pack between the thumb and fingers of the right hand and lifted clear of the small group that remains in the left hand. 

Cut (cards)<====>23190<====>Cut (cards)Not to be confused with cut card In many card games, to cut the cards (or to cut the deck) is a procedure used just prior to the cards being dealt to the players.  A common procedure is that after the cards have been shuffled, the dealer sets the cards face-down on the table near the player designated to make the cut, typically the player to the dealer's right.  That player initiates a cut of the deck by taking a contiguous range of cards off the top of the deck and placing it face-down on the table farther from the dealer; the dealer completes the cut by taking the original bottom portion of the deck and placing it on top of the just-moved cards. 

Philology<====>23193<====>Philology Philology is the study of language in oral and written historical sources; it is a combination of literary criticism, history, and linguistics.   It is more commonly defined as the study of literary texts as well as oral and written records, the establishment of their authenticity and their original form, and the determination of their meaning.  A person who pursues this kind of study is known as a philologist. In older usage, especially British, philology is more general, covering comparative and historical linguistics.   Classical philology studies classical languages.  Classical philology principally originated from the Library of Pergamum and the Library of Alexandria  around the fourth century BCE, continued by Greeks and Romans throughout the Roman/Byzantine Empire, preserved and promoted during the Islamic Golden Age, and eventually resumed by European scholars of the Renaissance, where it was soon joined by philologies of other non-Asian (European) (Germanic, Celtic), Eurasian (Slavistics, etc. 

Phonetics<====>23194<====>Phonetics  Phonetics (pronounced  ) is a branch of linguistics that studies the sounds of human speech, or—in the case of sign languages—the equivalent aspects of sign.   It is concerned with the physical properties of speech sounds or signs (phones): their physiological production, acoustic properties, auditory perception, and neurophysiological status.  Phonology, on the other hand, is concerned with the abstract, grammatical characterization of systems of sounds or signs. In the case of oral languages, phonetics has three basic areas of study:Articulatory phonetics: the study of the organs of speech and their use in producing speech sounds  by the speaker. 

Petroleum<====>23195<====>PetroleumPetroleum (from  : "rock" +  : "oil" ) is a naturally occurring, yellow-to-black liquid found in geological formations beneath the Earth's surface.  It is commonly refined into various types of fuels.  Components of petroleum are separated using a technique called fractional distillation i. e.  separation of a liquid mixture into fractions differing in boiling point  by means of distillation, typically using a fractionating column. It consists of hydrocarbons of various molecular weights and other organic compounds.   The name petroleum covers both naturally occurring unprocessed crude oil and petroleum products that are made up  of refined crude oil. 

Particular<====>23196<====>ParticularIn metaphysics, particulars are defined as concrete, spatiotemporal entities as opposed to abstract entities, such as properties or numbers.  There are, however, theories of abstract particulars or tropes.  For example, Socrates is a particular (there's only one Socrates-the-teacher-of-Plato and one cannot make copies of him, e. g. , by cloning him, without introducing new, distinct particulars).  Redness, by contrast, is not a particular, because it is abstract and multiply instantiated (my bicycle, this apple, and that woman's hair are all red). OverviewSybil Wolfram  writes  Particulars include only individuals of a certain kind: as a first approximation individuals with a definite place in space and time, such as persons and material objects or events, or which must be identified through such individuals, like smiles or thoughts. 

Poultry<====>23197<====>Poultry   Poultry ( ) are domesticated birds kept by humans for their eggs, their meat or their feathers.  These birds are most typically members of the superorder Galloanserae (fowl), especially the order Galliformes (which includes chickens, quails and turkeys). Poultry also includes other birds that are killed for their meat, such as the young of pigeons (known as squabs) but does not include similar wild birds hunted for sport or food and known as game.  The word "poultry" comes from the French/Norman word poule, itself derived from the Latin word pullus, which means small animal. The domestication of poultry took place several thousand years ago. 

Propaganda<====>23203<====>Propaganda  Propaganda is information that is not objective and is used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda, often by presenting facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using loaded language to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is presented.Propaganda is often associated with material prepared by governments, but activist groups, companies and the media can also produce propaganda.  In the twentieth century, the term propaganda has been associated with a manipulative approach, but propaganda historically was a neutral descriptive term.    A wide range of materials and media are used for conveying propaganda messages, which changed as new technologies were invented, including paintings, cartoons, posters, pamphlets, films, radio shows, TV shows, and websites. 

Physical quantity<====>23204<====>Physical quantity A physical quantity is a physical property of a phenomenon, body, or substance, that can be quantified by measurement.   A physical quantity can be expressed as the combination of a magnitude expressed by a number – usually a real number – and a unit:  n u  where  n  is the magnitude and  u  is the unit.  For example,   (the mass of the neutron), or   (the speed of light).  The same physical quantity  x  can be represented equivalently in many unit systems, i. 

Physical constant<====>23205<====>Physical constantA physical constant, sometimes fundamental physical constant, is a physical quantity that is generally believed to be both universal in nature and have constant value in time.  It is contrasted with a mathematical constant, which has a fixed numerical value, but does not directly involve any physical measurement. There are many physical constants in science, some of the most widely recognized being the speed of light in vacuum c, the gravitational constant G, Planck's constant h, the electric constant ε 0 , and the elementary charge e.  Physical constants can take many dimensional forms: the speed of light signifies a maximum speed limit of the Universe and is expressed dimensionally as length divided by time; while the fine-structure constant α, which characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction, is dimensionless. 

Parsley<====>23206<====>Parsley   Parsley or garden parsley (Petroselinum crispum) is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae, native to the central Mediterranean region (southern Italy, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Malta, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia), naturalized elsewhere in Europe, and widely cultivated as an herb, a spice, and a vegetable. Where it grows as a biennial, in the first year, it forms a rosette of tripinnate leaves   long with numerous   leaflets, and a taproot used as a food store over the winter. Parsley is widely used in European, Middle Eastern, and American cooking.  Curly leaf parsley is often used as a garnish. 

Peppermint<====>23209<====>Peppermint  Peppermint (Mentha × piperita, also known as Mentha balsamea Willd. )    is a hybrid mint, a cross between watermint and spearmint.   Indigenous to Europe and the Middle East, the plant is now widespread in cultivation in many regions of the world.  Euro+Med Plantbase Project:  Mentha × piperitaIt is occasionally found in the wild with its parent species.   Flora of NW Europe: Mentha × piperita   BotanyPeppermint was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus from specimens that had been collected in England; he treated it as a species, Linnaeus, C. 

Pseudorandomness<====>23210<====>Pseudorandomness A pseudorandom process is a process that appears to be random but is not.  Pseudorandom sequences typically exhibit statistical randomness while being generated by an entirely deterministic causal process.  Such a process is easier to produce than a genuinely random one, and has the benefit that it can be used again and again to produce exactly the same numbers, which is useful for testing and fixing software. To generate truly random numbers would require precise, accurate, and repeatable system measurements of absolutely non-deterministic processes.  Linux uses, for example, various system timings (like user keystrokes, I/O, or least-significant digit voltage measurements) to produce a pool of random numbers. 

Poales<====>23212<====>Poales  The Poales are a large order of flowering plants in the monocotyledons, and includes families of plants such as the grasses, bromeliads, and sedges.   Sixteen plant families are currently recognized by botanists to be part of Poales. DescriptionThe flowers are typically small, enclosed by bracts, and arranged in inflorescences (except in three species of the genus Mayaca, which possess very reduced, one-flowered inflorescences).  The flowers of many species are wind pollinated; the seeds usually contain starch. TaxonomyThe APG III system (2009) accepts the order within a monocot clade called commelinids, and accepts the following 16 families:  The earlier APG system (1998) adopted the same placement of the order, although it used the spelling "commelinoids". 

Political correctness<====>23213<====>Political correctness   The term political correctness (adjectivally: politically correct; commonly abbreviated to PC or P. C. ) is used  to describe language, policies, or measures that are intended to avoid offense or disadvantage to members of particular groups in society.  For definitions see:  Since the late 1980s, the term has come to refer to avoiding language or behavior that can be seen as excluding, marginalizing, or insulting groups of people considered disadvantaged or discriminated against, especially groups defined by sex or race. 

Ploidy<====>23219<====>PloidyPloidy is the number of sets of chromosomes in a cell, and hence the number of possible alleles for autosomal and pseudoautosomal genes. Somatic cells, tissues and individuals can be described according to the number of sets present (the ploidy level): monoploid (1 set), diploid (2 sets), triploid (3 sets), tetraploid (4 sets), pentaploid (5 sets), hexaploid (6 sets), heptaploid    or septaploid    (7 sets), etc.  The generic term polyploid is used to describe cells with three or more chromosome sets.  Humans are diploid organisms, carrying two complete sets of chromosomes: one set of 23 chromosomes from their father and one set of 23 chromosomes from their mother. 

Playboy<====>23221<====>Playboy    Playboy is an American men's lifestyle and entertainment magazine.  It was founded in Chicago in 1953, by Hugh Hefner and his associates, and funded in part by a $1,000 loan from Hefner's mother.    Notable for its centerfolds of nude and semi-nude  models (Playmates), Playboy played an important role in the sexual revolution  and remains one of the world's best-known brands, having grown into Playboy Enterprises, Inc. , with a presence in nearly every medium.   In addition to the flagship magazine in the United States, special nation-specific versions of Playboy are published worldwide. 

Pennsylvanian (geology)<====>23222<====>Pennsylvanian (geology) The Pennsylvanian (also known as Upper Carboniferous or Late Carboniferous) is in the ICS geologic timescale, the younger of two subperiods (or upper of two subsystems) of the Carboniferous Period.  It lasted from roughly   Ma (million years ago).  As with most other geochronologic units, the rock beds that define the Pennsylvanian are well identified, but the exact date of the start and end are uncertain by a few hundred thousand years.  The Pennsylvanian is named after the U. S.  state of Pennsylvania, where the coal-productive beds of this age are widespread.    The division between Pennsylvanian and Mississippian comes from North American stratigraphy. 

Paul Héroult<====>23224<====>Paul Héroult  Paul (Louis-Toussaint) Héroult (10 April  1863 – 9 May 1914) was a French scientist.  He was the inventor of the aluminium electrolysis and developed the first successful commercial electric arc furnace.He lived in Thury-Harcourt, Normandy. Life and careerPaul Héroult read Henri Sainte-Claire Deville's treatise on aluminium, when he was 15 years old.  At that time, aluminium was as expensive as silver and was used mostly for luxury items and jewellery.  Héroult wanted to make it cheaper. He succeeded in doing so when he discovered the electrolytic aluminium process in 1886. 

Permian<====>23226<====>Permian  The Permian is a geologic period and system which spans 46. 7 million years from the end of the Carboniferous Period   million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Triassic period  251. 902 Mya.  It is the last period of the Paleozoic era; the following Triassic period belongs to the Mesozoic era.  The concept of the Permian was introduced in 1841 by geologist Sir Roderick Murchison, who named it after the city of Perm. The Permian witnessed the diversification of the early amniotes into the ancestral groups of the mammals, turtles, lepidosaurs, and archosaurs. 

Pisces (constellation)<====>23227<====>Pisces (constellation)  Pisces  is a constellation of the zodiac.  Its name is the Latin plural for fish.  It lies between Aquarius to the west and Aries to the east.  The ecliptic and the celestial equator intersect within this constellation and in Virgo.  Its symbol is  (Unicode ♓). FeaturesThe vernal equinox is currently located in Pisces, due south of ω Psc, and, due to precession, slowly drifting below the western fish towards Aquarius. StarsVan Maanen's Star, at 12. 36 magnitude, is located in this constellation, along with others, such as HD 222410, at 7. 

Paul Robeson<====>23229<====>Paul Robeson  Paul Leroy Robeson (pronounced    ;   April 9, 1898 – January 23, 1976) was an American bass baritone singer and actor who became involved with the Civil Rights Movement.  At Rutgers College, he was an American football player, and then had an international career in singing, as well as acting in theater and movies.  He became politically involved in response to the Spanish Civil War, fascism, and social injustices.  His advocacy of anti-imperialism, affiliation with communism, and criticism of the United States government caused him to be blacklisted during the McCarthy era. 

Polaris<====>23230<====>Polaris  Polaris, designated Alpha Ursae Minoris (  Ursae Minoris, abbreviated Alpha UMi,   UMi), commonly the North Star or Pole Star, is the brightest star in the constellation of Ursa Minor.  It is very close to the north celestial pole, making it the current northern pole star.   The revised Hipparcos parallax gives a distance to Polaris of about 433 light-years (133 parsecs), while calculations by other methods derive distances around 30% closer. Polaris is a multiple star, comprising the main star (Polaris Aa, a yellow supergiant) in orbit with a smaller companion (Polaris Ab); the pair in orbit with Polaris B (discovered in August 1779 by William Herschel). 

Parabola<====>23231<====>Parabola In mathematics, a parabola is a plane curve, which is mirror-symmetrical, and is approximately U-shaped when oriented as shown in the diagram below (it remains a parabola if is differently oriented).  It fits any of several superficially different mathematical descriptions, which can all be proved to define exactly the same curves. One description of a parabola involves a point (the focus) and a line (the directrix).  The focus does not lie on the directrix.  The parabola is the locus of points in that plane that are equidistant from both the directrix and the focus.  Another description of a parabola is as a conic section, created from the intersection of a right circular conical surface and a plane which is parallel to another plane which is tangential to the conical surface. 

Problem of the criterion<====>23233<====>Problem of the criterionIn the field of epistemology, the problem of the criterion is an issue regarding the starting point of knowledge.  This is a separate and more fundamental issue than the regress argument found in discussions on justification of knowledge.  American philosopher Roderick M.  Chisholm in his Theory of Knowledge details the problem of the criterion with two sets of questions:1.  What do we know? or What is the extent of our knowledge?2.  How do we know? or What is the criterion of knowing?An answer to either set of questions will allow us to devise a means of answering the other. 

Paleozoic<====>23234<====>Paleozoic  The Paleozoic (or Palaeozoic) Era ( ;   from the Greek palaios (παλαιός), "old" and zoe (ζωή), "life", meaning "ancient life"   ) is the earliest of three geologic eras of the Phanerozoic Eon.  It is the longest of the Phanerozoic eras, lasting from  , and is subdivided into six geologic periods (from oldest to youngest): the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian.  The Paleozoic comes after the Neoproterozoic Era of the Proterozoic Eon and is followed by the Mesozoic Era. The Paleozoic was a time of dramatic geological, climatic, and evolutionary change. 

Pakistan<====>23235<====>Pakistan  Pakistan (  or  ;  ), officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan ( ), is a country in South Asia.  It is the fifth-most populous country with a population exceeding  209,970,000 people.   In terms of area, it is the 33rd-largest country spanning  .  Pakistan has a   coastline along the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest, and China in the far northeast, respectively.  It is separated narrowly from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's  Wakhan Corridor in the north-west, and also shares a maritime border with Oman. 

Geography of China<====>23237<====>Geography of China   China has great physical diversity.  The eastern plains and southern coasts of the country consist of fertile lowlands and foothills and is the location of most of China's agricultural output and human population.  The southern areas of the country (South of the Yangtze River) consist of hilly and mountainous terrain.  The west and north of the country are dominated by sunken basins (such as the Gobi and the Taklamakan), rolling plateaus, and towering massifs.  It contains part of the highest tableland on earth, the Tibetan Plateau, and has much lower agricultural potential and population. 

Demographics of China<====>23238<====>Demographics of China  The demographics of the People's Republic of China are identified by a large population with a relatively small youth division, which was partially a result of China's one-child policy.  China's population reached the billion mark in 1982.  China's population is 1. 411 billion , the largest of any country in the world.  According to the 2010 census, 91. 51% of the population was Han Chinese, and 8. 49% were minorities.  China's population growth rate is only 0. 59%, ranking 159th in the world.   China conducted its sixth national population census on 1 November 2010. 

Politics of China<====>23239<====>Politics of China    The politics of the People's Republic of China takes place in a framework of a semi-presidential socialist republic run by a single party, the Communist Party of China.  State power within the People's Republic of China (PRC) is exercised through the Communist Party, the Central People's Government and their provincial and local representation .  The Communist Party of China uses Internal Reference to manage and monitor internal disagreements among the people of People's Republic of China.  https://www. bing. com/images/search?view=detailV2&ccid=ZihTFjUL&id=80F2B85FCC80B0EECE3822F33B40291191E84E84&q=doggo&simid=608008400919333230&selectedIndex=2&ajaxhist=0   Document Number Nine was circulated among the Chinese Communist Party in 2013 by Xi–Li Administration to tighten control of the ideological sphere in China to ensure the supreme leadership of the Communist State will not be challenged by Western influences. 

Telecommunications in China<====>23241<====>Telecommunications in China  The People's Republic of China possesses a diversified communications system that links all parts of the country by Internet, telephone, telegraph, radio, and television.  The country is served by an extensive system of automatic telephone exchanges connected by modern networks of fiber-optic cable, coaxial cable, microwave radio relay, and a domestic satellite system; cellular telephone service is widely available, expanding rapidly, and includes roaming service to foreign countries.  Fiber to the x infrastructure has been expanded rapidly in recent years. History When the People's Republic was founded in 1949, the telecommunications systems and facilities in China first established by the Qing and Republican ITA and Ministry of Posts and Communications had been seriously damaged from over thirty years of on and off war between warlords, Japan, and the two sides of the Chinese Civil War. 

Transport in China<====>23242<====>Transport in China  Transport in China has experienced major growth and expansion in recent years.  Although China's transport system comprises a vast network of transport nodes across its huge territory, the nodes tend to concentrate in the more economically developed coastal areas and inland cities along major rivers.   The physical state and comprehensiveness of China's transport infrastructure tend to vary widely by geography.  While remote, rural areas still largely depend on non-mechanized means of transport, a modern maglev system was built in China to connect the city center of Shanghai with Shanghai Pudong International Airport. 

Foreign relations of China<====>23244<====>Foreign relations of China   The foreign relations of the People's Republic of China (PRC), commonly known as to most states as China, are the relations between the People's Republic of China and other countries.  It guides the way in which it interacts with foreign nations and expresses its political, economic and cultural strengths, weaknesses  and values.  As a great power and emerging superpower, China's foreign policy and strategic thinking are highly influential.  China officially states it "unswervingly pursues an independent foreign policy of peace.  The fundamental goals of this policy are to preserve China's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, create a favorable international environment for China's reform and opening up and modernization construction, maintain world peace and propel common development. 

Phonology<====>23247<====>Phonology  Phonology is a branch of linguistics concerned with the systematic organization of sounds in languages.  It has traditionally focused largely on the study of the systems of phonemes in particular languages (and therefore used to be also called phonemics, or phonematics), but it may also cover any linguistic analysis either at a level beneath the word (including syllable, onset and rime, articulatory gestures, articulatory features, mora, etc. ) or at all levels of language where sound is considered to be structured for conveying linguistic meaning.  Phonology also includes the study of equivalent non-oral languages such as ASL or other sign languages. 

Prometheus<====>23250<====>Prometheus  In Greek mythology, Prometheus ( ;  ,  , meaning "forethought")  is a Titan, culture hero, and trickster figure who is credited with the creation of man from clay, and who defies the gods by stealing fire and giving it to humanity, an act that enabled progress and civilization.  Prometheus is known for his intelligence and as a champion of mankind.  The punishment of Prometheus as a consequence of the theft is a major theme of his mythology, and is a popular subject of both ancient and modern art.  Zeus, king of the Olympian gods, sentenced the Titan to eternal torment for his transgression. 

Phenylketonuria<====>23251<====>Phenylketonuria   Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism that results in decreased metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine.Untreated PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders.   It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin.   Babies born to mothers who have poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a small head, and low birth weight.   Phenylketonuria is a genetic disorder inherited from a person's parents.   It is due to mutations in the PAH gene which results in low levels of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. 

Parallax<====>23253<====>Parallax Parallax is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines. The term is derived  .  Due to foreshortening, nearby objects show a larger parallax than farther objects when observed from different positions, so parallax can be used to determine distances. To measure large distances, such as the distance of a planet or a star from Earth, astronomers use the principle of parallax.  Here, the term parallax is the semi-angle of inclination between two sight-lines to the star, as observed when Earth is on opposite sides of the Sun in its orbit. 

Paralysis<====>23254<====>Paralysis    Paralysis is a loss of muscle function for one or more muscles.  Paralysis can be accompanied by a loss of feeling (sensory loss) in the affected area if there is sensory damage as well as motor.  About 1 in 50 people in the U. S.  have been diagnosed with some form of paralysis, transient or permanent.   The word comes from the Greek παράλυσις, "disabling of the nerves",  itself from παρά (para), "beside, by"  and λύσις (lysis), "losing"  and that from λύω (luō), "to lose".   A paralysis accompanied by involuntary tremors is usually called "palsy". 

Paths of Glory<====>23255<====>Paths of Glory    Paths of Glory is a 1957 American anti-war film    by Stanley Kubrick based on the novel of the same name by Humphrey Cobb.   Set during World War I, the film stars Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax, the commanding officer of French soldiers who refuse to continue a suicidal attack.   Dax attempts to defend them against a charge of cowardice in a court-martial. BackgroundCobb's novel had no title when it was finished, so the publisher held a contest.   The winning entry came from the ninth stanza of the Thomas Gray 1751 poem "Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard". 

Particle physics<====>23259<====>Particle physics   Particle physics (also high energy physics) is the branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute matter and radiation.  Although the word "particle" can refer to various types of very small objects (e. g.  protons, gas particles, or even household dust), "particle physics" usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the fundamental interactions necessary to explain their behaviour.  By our current understanding, these elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions.  The currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the Standard Model. 

List of peninsulas<====>23260<====>List of peninsulasPresented below is a list of peninsulas.  A peninsula (  from paene "almost" and insula "island") is a piece of land that is bordered by water on three sides but connected to mainland.  The surrounding water is usually understood to be continuous, though not necessarily named as such.  A peninsula can also be a headland, cape, island promontory, bill, point,or spit.   A point is generally considered a tapering piece of land projecting into a body of water that is less prominent than a cape. 

Physical geography<====>23263<====>Physical geography Physical geography (also known as geosystems or physiography) is one of the two major sub-fields of geography.Physical geography is that branch of natural science which deals with the study of processes and patterns in the natural environment like the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere, as opposed to the cultural or built environment, the domain of human geography. Sub-branchesPhysical Geography can be divided into several sub-fields, as follows:Geomorphology is the field concerned with understanding the surface of the Earth and the processes by which it is shaped, both at the present as well as in the past. 

Plain<====>23264<====>Plain In geography, a plain is a flat, sweeping landmass that generally does not change much in elevation.  Plains occur as lowlands along the bottoms of valleys or on the doorsteps of mountains, as coastal plains, and as plateaus or uplands.   In a valley, a plain is enclosed on two sides but in other cases a plain may be delineated by a complete or partial ring of hills, by mountains or cliffs.  Where a geological region contains more than one plain, they may be connected by a pass (sometimes termed a gap).  Coastal plains would mostly rise from sea level until they run into elevated features such as mountains or plateaus. 

Peter Altenberg<====>23265<====>Peter Altenberg   Peter Altenberg (9 March 1859 – 8 January 1919) was a writer and poet from Vienna, Austria.  He was key to the genesis of early modernism in the city. BiographyHe was born Richard Engländer on 9 March 1859 in Vienna.  The nom de plume, "Altenberg", came from a small town on the Danube river.  Allegedly, he chose the "Peter" to honor a young girl whom he remembered as an unrequited love (it had been her nickname).  Although he grew up in a middle class Jewish family, Altenberg eventually separated himself from his family of origin by dropping out of both law and medical school, and embracing Bohemianism as a permanent lifestyle choice. 

Palestinians<====>23267<====>Palestinians The Palestinian people ( , ash-sha‘b al-Filasṭīnī), also referred to as Palestinians ( , al-Filasṭīniyyūn,  ) or Palestinian Arabs ( , al-'arabi il-filastini), are an ethnonational group   comprising the modern descendants of the peoples who have lived in Palestine over the centuries, including Jews and Samaritans, and who today are largely culturally and linguistically Arab.    Despite various wars and exoduses (such as that in 1948), roughly one half of the world's Palestinian population continues to reside in historic Palestine, the area encompassing the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Israel. 

Physicist<====>23269<====>Physicist  A physicist is a scientist who has specialized knowledge in the field of physics, which encompasses the interactions of matter and energy at all length and time scales in the physical universe. Physicists generally are interested in the root or ultimate causes of phenomena, and usually frame their understanding in mathematical terms.  Physicists work across a wide range of research fields, spanning all length scales: from sub-atomic and particle physics, to molecular length scales of chemical and biological interest, to cosmological length scales encompassing the Universe as a whole.  The field generally includes two types of physicists: experimental physicists who specialize in the observation of physical phenomena and the analysis of experiments, and theoretical physicists who specialize in mathematical modeling of physical systems to rationalize, explain and predict natural phenomena. 

Peter Nilson<====>23272<====>Peter Nilson Peter Nilson (17 October 1937 – 8 March 1998) was a Swedish astronomer and novelist.   Active at Uppsala University, he compiled a catalogue of galaxies.   He was appreciated for a number of essay books (primarily about science) and for a number of science fiction novels like Rymdväktaren, or "The Space Guardian" and Nyaga. He was born in a Smålandian village and under the early teens a farmer, but science, with its celebrities such as Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein made such an impression on him, as to motivate him to accomplish college studies by letter correspondence. 

Patent<====>23273<====>Patent   A patent is a set of exclusive rights granted by a sovereign state to an inventor or assignee for a limited period of time in exchange for detailed public disclosure of an invention.   An invention is a solution to a specific technological problem and is a product or a process.  WIPO Intellectual Property Handbook: Policy, Law and Use.  Chapter 2: Fields of Intellectual Property Protection WIPO 2008   Patents are a form of intellectual property. The procedure for granting patents, requirements placed on the patentee, and the extent of the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. 

Pythagoras<====>23275<====>PythagorasPythagoras of Samos ( ;;, or simply  ; Πυθαγόρης in Ionian Greek;   ) "The dates of his life cannot be fixed exactly, but assuming the approximate correctness of the statement of Aristoxenus (ap.  Porph.  V. P.  9) that he left Samos to escape the tyranny of Polycrates at the age of forty, we may put his birth round about 570 BC, or a few years earlier.  The length of his life was variously estimated in antiquity, but it is agreed that he lived to a fairly ripe old age, and most probably he died at about seventy-five or eighty. 

Philosopher<====>23276<====>Philosopher  A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside either theology or science.The term "philosopher" comes from the Ancient Greek   (philosophos) meaning "lover of wisdom".  The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC).    In the classical sense, a philosopher was someone who lived according to a certain way of life, focusing on resolving existential questions about the human condition, and not someone who discourses upon theories or comments upon authors.   Typically, these particular brands of philosophy are Hellenistic ones and those who most arduously commit themselves to this lifestyle may be considered philosophers. 

The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch<====>23279<====>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch is a 1965 science fiction novel by US writer Philip K.  Dick.  It was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1965.    The novel takes place some time in the 21st century.  Under United Nations authority, humankind has colonized every habitable planet and moon in the solar system.  Like many of Dick's novels, it utilizes an array of science fiction concepts, features several layers of reality and unreality and philosophical ideas.  It is one of Dick's first works to explore religious themes. 

Time Out of Joint<====>23280<====>Time Out of Joint  Time Out of Joint is a dystopian novel by Philip K.  Dick, first published in novel form in the United States in 1959.  An abridged version was also serialised in the British science fiction magazine New Worlds Science Fiction in several installments from December 1959 to February 1960. The novel epitomizes many of Dick's themes with its concerns about the nature of reality and ordinary people in ordinary lives having the world unravel around them.  The title is a reference to the line uttered by Hamlet to Horatio after being visited by his father's ghost and learning that his uncle Claudius murdered his father; in short, a shocking supernatural event that fundamentally alters the way Hamlet perceives the state and the universe ("The time is out of joint; O cursed spite!/That ever I was born to set it right!" [I. 

A Scanner Darkly<====>23281<====>A Scanner Darkly  A Scanner Darkly is a  science fiction novel by American writer Philip K.  Dick, published in 1977.  The semi-autobiographical story is set in a dystopian Orange County, California, in the then-future of June 1994, and includes an extensive portrayal of drug culture and drug use (both recreational and abusive).  The novel is one of Dick's best-known works and served as the basis for a 2006 film of the same name, directed by Richard Linklater. Plot summaryThe protagonist is Bob Arctor, member of a household of drug users, who is also living a parallel life as Agent Fred, an undercover police agent assigned to spy on Arctor's household. 

Ubik<====>23282<====>Ubik  Ubik (   ) is a 1969 science fiction novel by American writer Philip K.  Dick.  It is one of Dick's most acclaimed novels.  In 2009, it was chosen by Time magazine as one of the 100 greatest novels since 1923.  In his review for Time, critic Lev Grossman described it as "a deeply unsettling existential horror story, a nightmare you'll never be sure you've woken up from".  PlotBy the year 1992, humanity has colonized the Moon and psychic powers are common.  The protagonist, Joe Chip, is a debt-ridden technician working for Runciter Associates, a "prudence organization" employing "inertials"—people with the ability to negate the powers of telepaths and "precogs"—to enforce the privacy of clients. 

Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?<====>23284<====>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?   Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (retitled Blade Runner: Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? in some later printings) is a science fiction novel by American writer Philip K.  Dick, first published in 1968.  The novel is set in a post-apocalyptic San Francisco, where Earth's life has been greatly damaged by nuclear global war.  Most animal species are endangered or extinct from extreme radiation poisoning, so that owning an animal is now a sign of status and empathy, an attitude encouraged towards animals.  The book served as the primary basis for the 1982 film Blade Runner, and many elements and themes from it were used in its 2017 sequel Blade Runner 2049. 

Radio Free Albemuth<====>23285<====>Radio Free Albemuth  Radio Free Albemuth is a dystopian novel by Philip K.  Dick, written in 1976 and published posthumously in 1985.  Originally titled VALISystem A, it was his first attempt to deal in fiction with his experiences of early 1974.  When his publishers at Bantam requested extensive rewrites he canned the project and reworked it into the VALIS trilogy.  Arbor House acquired the rights to Radio Free Albemuth in 1985.  They then published an edition under the current title (the original was too close to VALIS), prepared from the corrected typescript given by Dick to his friend Tim Powers. 

Passport<====>23287<====>Passport  A passport is a travel document, usually issued by a country's government, that certifies the identity and nationality of its holder primarily for the purpose of international travel.Standard passports may contain information such as the holder's name, place and date of birth, photograph, signature, and other identifying information.  Many countries are moving towards including biometric information in a microchip embedded in the passport, making them machine-readable and difficult to counterfeit.   There are currently over 120 jurisdictions issuing e-Passport.   Previously issued passports usually remain valid until each expires. A passport holder is normally entitled to enter the country that issued the passport, though some people entitled to a passport may not be full citizens with right of abode. 

Point-of-view shot<====>23288<====>Point-of-view shot  A point of view shot (also known as POV shot, First-person shot or a subjective camera) is a short film scene that shows what a character (the subject) is looking at (represented through the camera).  It is usually established by being positioned between a shot of a character looking at something, and a shot showing the character's reaction (see shot reverse shot).  The technique of POV is one of the foundations of film editing. SubjectivesA POV shot need not be the strict point-of-view of an actual single character in a film.  Sometimes the point-of-view shot is taken over the shoulder of the character (third person), who remains visible on the screen. 

Persistence of vision<====>23289<====>Persistence of vision Persistence of vision refers to the optical illusion that occurs when visual perception of an object does not cease for some time after the rays of light proceeding from it have ceased to enter the eye.The illusion has also been described as "retinal persistence",  "persistence of impressions" , simply "persistence" and other variations. This has been believed to be the explanation for motion perception in cinema and animated films, but this theory has long been discarded by scientists. It is assumed that the illusion that film historians often refer to as "persistence of vision" is the same as what is known as positive afterimages by psychologists. 

Propaganda film<====>23290<====>Propaganda film  A propaganda film is a film that involves some form of propaganda.  Propaganda films may be packaged in numerous ways, but are most often documentary-style productions or fictional screenplays, that are produced to convince the viewer of a specific political point or influence the opinions or behavior of the viewer, often by providing subjective content that may be deliberately misleading.  Propaganda is the ability "to produce and spread fertile messages that, once sown, will germinate in large human cultures. ” Combs, James.  Film Propaganda and American Politics.  New York: Garland Publishing, 1994.  p. 

Pliocene<====>23291<====>Pliocene  The Pliocene ( ;   also Pleiocene ) Epoch is the epoch in the geologic timescale that extends from 5. 333 million to 2. 58 See the 2014 version of the ICS geologic time scale    million years BP.  It is the second and youngest epoch of the Neogene Period in the Cenozoic Era.  The Pliocene follows the Miocene Epoch and is followed by the Pleistocene Epoch.  Prior to the 2009 revision of the geologic time scale, which placed the four most recent major glaciations entirely within the Pleistocene, the Pliocene also included the Gelasian stage, which lasted from 2. 

Pharaoh<====>23294<====>Pharaoh Pharaoh ( ,    Dictionary Reference: pharaoh  or   ;  ) is the common title of the monarchs of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty (c.  3150 BCE) until the annexation of Egypt by the Roman Empire in 30 BCE,  although the actual term "Pharaoh" was not used contemporaneously for a ruler until circa 1200 BCE.  In the early dynasty, Ancient Egyptian kings used to have up to three titles, the Horus, the Nesu Bety, and the Nebty name.  The Golden Horus and Nomen and prenomen titles were later added. 

Printing press<====>23295<====>Printing press    A printing press is a device for applying pressure to an inked surface resting upon a print medium (such as paper or cloth), thereby transferring the ink.   This was a dramatic improvement on earlier printing methods in which the cloth, paper or other medium was brushed or rubbed repeatedly to achieve the transfer of ink, and accelerated the process.   Typically used for texts, the invention and spread of the printing press was one of the most influential events in the second millennium.   The printing press with movable type was invented in East Asia, for a complex writing system, circa 1234  . 

Pat Rafter<====>23297<====>Pat Rafter   Patrick Michael Rafter (born 28 December 1972) is a former Australian professional tennis player.  He reached a career-high Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world No.  1 singles ranking on July 26, 1999.  His career highlights include consecutive US Open titles in 1997 and 1998 and consecutive runner-up at Wimbledon in 2000 and 2001. He became the first man in the Open Era to win Canada Masters, Cincinnati Masters and the US Open in the same year, which he achieved in 1998; this achievement has been dubbed the American Summer Slam.  To date, only 2 players have followed this feat: Andy Roddick in 2003 and Rafael Nadal in 2013. 

Proportional representation<====>23298<====>Proportional representation  Proportional representation (PR) characterizes electoral systems by which divisions in an electorate are reflected proportionately in the elected body. If n% of the electorate support a particular political party, then roughly n% of seats will be won by that party. The essence of such systems is that all votes contribute to the result: not just a plurality, or a bare majority, of them.   The most prevalent forms of proportional representation all require the use of multiple-member voting districts (also called super-districts), as it is not possible to fill a single seat in a proportional manner. 

Provisional Irish Republican Army<====>23299<====>Provisional Irish Republican Army    The Provisional Irish Republican Army (Provisional IRA) is a formerIrish republican paramilitary organisation that sought to remove Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom and to bring about an independent socialist  republic encompassing all of Ireland.    It was the biggest and most active republican paramilitary group during the Troubles.  It saw itself as the successor to the original IRA and called itself simply the Irish Republican Army (IRA), or Óglaigh na hÉireann in Irish,  and was widely referred to as such by others. 

Paula Abdul<====>23300<====>Paula Abdul Paula Julie Abdul (born June 19, 1962)    is an American singer, songwriter, voice actress, dancer, choreographer, actress and television personality.  She began her career as a cheerleader for the Los Angeles Lakers at the age of 18   before rising to prominence in the 1980s as a highly sought choreographer at the height of the music video era.  Abdul later scored a string of pop music hits in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Her six number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 tie her with Diana Ross for seventh among the female solo performers who have topped the chart. 

Project Gutenberg<====>23301<====>Project Gutenberg  Project Gutenberg (PG) is a volunteer effort to digitize and archive cultural works, to "encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks".It was founded in 1971 by Michael S.  Hart and is the oldest digital library.   Most of the items in its collection are the full texts of public domain books.  The project tries to make these as free as possible, in long-lasting, open formats that can be used on almost any computer.   , Project Gutenberg reached 50,000 items in its collection.  The releases are available in plain text but, wherever possible, other formats are included, such as HTML, PDF, EPUB, MOBI, and Plucker. 

Personal area network<====>23303<====>Personal area network A personal area network (PAN) is a computer network used for data transmission amongst devices such as computers, telephones, tablets and personal digital assistants.  PANs can be used for communication amongst the personal devices themselves (interpersonal communication), or for connecting to a higher level network and the Internet (an uplink) where one master device takes up the role as internet router.  A PAN may be carried over wired computer buses such as USB and FireWire. A wireless personal area network (WPAN) is a low-powered PAN carried over a short-distance wireless network technology such as:INSTEONIrDAWireless USBBluetoothZ-WaveZigBeeThe reach of a WPAN varies from a few centimeters to a few meters. 

Personal digital assistant<====>23304<====>Personal digital assistant   A personal digital assistant (PDA), also known as a handheld PC,   is a mobile device that functions as a personal information manager.  PDAs were largely discontinued in the early 2010s after the widespread adoption of highly capable smartphones, in particular those based on iOS and Android.    Nearly all PDAs have the ability to connect to the Internet.  A PDA has an electronic visual display, letting it include a web browser.  All models also have audio capabilities, allowing usage as a portable media player, and also enabling most of them to be used as telephones. 

POSIX<====>23305<====>POSIX  The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)  is a family of standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems.  POSIX defines the application programming interface (API), along with command line shells and utility interfaces, for software compatibility with variants of Unix and other operating systems.NameOriginally, the name "POSIX" referred to IEEE Std 1003. 1-1988, released in 1988.  The family of POSIX standards is formally designated as IEEE 1003 and the international standard name is ISO/IEC 9945. The standards emerged from a project that began circa 1985. 

Personal Telco<====>23306<====>Personal Telco The Personal Telco Project (or PTP) is a wireless community network project in Portland, Oregon.  It was founded by Adam Shand in November 2000  after he read a Slashdot article about the Consume The Net project in London.  PTP has wireless hotspots offering free Internet access at locations around Portland including Pioneer Courthouse Square, three public parks, and several restaurants and coffee shops using Wi-Fi.    In 2005 PTP was involved in a grant-funded project to bring free wireless Internet to an entire neighborhood in North Portland, along N.  Mississippi Avenue.  PTP is a non-profit organization in the state of Oregon, and received its 501(c)(3) status (a federal tax exemption granted to charitable organizations) in early 2003.

He also created and launched the first successful commercial anti-spam service.   He authored the standard UNIX system programs SENDS, proxynet, rtty and Vixie cron.  At one point he ran his own consulting business, Vixie Enterprises. CareerVixie was a software engineer at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) from 1988 – 1993.  After he left DEC in 1994, he founded Internet Software Consortium (ISC) together with Rick Adams and Carl Malamud to support BIND and other software for the Internet. 

Pleistocene<====>23310<====>Pleistocene The Pleistocene ( ,  often colloquially referred to as the Ice Age) is the geological epoch which lasted from about 2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago, spanning the world's most recent period of repeated glaciations.  The end of the Pleistocene corresponds with the end of the last glacial period and also with the end of the Paleolithic age used in archaeology. The Pleistocene is the first epoch of the Quaternary Period or sixth epoch of the Cenozoic Era.      In Gradstein, F.  M. , Ogg, James G. , and Smith, A.  Gilbert (eds. 

Pasteurization<====>23311<====>Pasteurization  Pasteurization or pasteurisation  is a process that kills microbes (mainly bacteria) in food and drink, such as milk, juice, canned food, and others. It was invented by French scientist Louis Pasteur during the nineteenth century.  In 1864 Pasteur discovered that heating beer and wine was enough to kill most of the bacteria that caused spoilage, preventing these beverages from turning sour.   The process achieves this by eliminating pathogenic microbes and lowering microbial numbers to prolong the quality of the beverage.  Today, pasteurization is used widely in the dairy industry and other food processing industries to achieve food preservation and food safety. 

Penicillin<====>23312<====>Penicillin    Penicillin (PCN or pen) is a group of antibiotics which include penicillin G (intravenous use), penicillin V (use by mouth), procaine penicillin, and benzathine penicillin (intramuscular use).  Penicillin antibiotics were among the first medications to be effective against many bacterial infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci.  They are still widely used today, though many types of bacteria have developed resistance following extensive use.  About 10% of people report that they are allergic to penicillin; however, up to 90% of this group may not actually be allergic.   Serious allergies only occur in about 0. 

Piri Reis<====>23313<====>Piri Reis Ahmed Muhiddin Piri (1465/70–1553 ), better known as Piri Reis (  or Hacı Ahmet Muhittin Pîrî Bey), was an Ottoman admiral, navigator, geographer and cartographer. He is primarily known today for his maps and charts collected in his Kitab-ı Bahriye (Book of Navigation), a book that contains detailed information on navigation, as well as very accurate charts (for their time) describing the important ports and cities of the Mediterranean Sea.  He gained fame as a cartographer when a small part of his first world map (prepared in 1513) was discovered in 1929 at the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul. 

Physician<====>23315<====>Physician A physician, medical practitioner, medical doctor, or simply doctor is a professional who practises medicine, which is concerned with promoting, maintaining, or restoring health through the study, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, injury, and other physical and mental impairments.  Physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories, types of patients and methods of treatment—known as specialities—or they may assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals, families, and communities—known as general practice.   Medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines (such as anatomy and physiology) underlying diseases and their treatment—the science of medicine—and also a decent competence in its applied practice—the art or craft of medicine. 

Pound (mass)<====>23316<====>Pound (mass)   The pound or pound-mass is a unit of mass used in the imperial, United States customary and other systems of measurement.  A number of different definitions have been used; the most common today is the international avoirdupois pound, which is legally defined as exactly  , and which is divided into 16 avoirdupois ounces.   The international standard symbol for the avoirdupois pound is lb;  an alternative symbol is lb m (for most pound definitions), # (chiefly in the U. S. ), and ℔  or ″̶  (specifically for the apothecaries' pound). 

Proton<====>23317<====>Proton  A proton is a subatomic particle, symbol   or  , with a positive electric charge of +1e elementary charge and mass slightly less than that of a neutron.  Protons and neutrons, each with masses of approximately one atomic mass unit, are collectively referred to as "nucleons". One or more protons are present in the nucleus of every atom; they are a necessary part of the nucleus.  The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as the atomic number (represented by the symbol Z).  Since each element has a unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number. 

Phosphorus<====>23318<====>Phosphorus    Phosphorus is a chemical element with symbol P and atomic number 15.  As an element, phosphorus exists in two major forms—white phosphorus and red phosphorus—but because it is highly reactive, phosphorus is never found as a free element on Earth.  At 0. 099%, phosphorus is the most abundant pnictogen in the Earth's crust.  With few exceptions, minerals containing phosphorus are in the maximally oxidized state as inorganic phosphate rocks. The first form of elemental phosphorus to be produced (white phosphorus, in 1669) emits a faint glow when exposed to oxygen – hence the name, taken from Greek mythology,   meaning "light-bearer" (Latin Lucifer), referring to the "Morning Star", the planet Venus (or Mercury). 

Palladium<====>23319<====>Palladium  Palladium is a chemical element with symbol Pd and atomic number 46.  It is a rare and lustrous silvery-white metal discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston.  He named it after the asteroid Pallas, which was itself named after the epithet of the Greek goddess Athena, acquired by her when she slew Pallas.  Palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium form a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals (PGMs).  These have similar chemical properties, but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them. More than half the supply of palladium and its congener platinum is used in catalytic converters, which convert as much as 90% of the harmful gases in automobile exhaust (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide) into less noxious substances (nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapor). 

Promethium<====>23321<====>Promethium   Promethium (formerly prometheum) is a chemical element with symbol Pm and atomic number 61.  All of its isotopes are radioactive; it is extremely rare, with only about 500-600 grams naturally occurring in Earth's crust at any given time, and one of only two such elements that are followed in the periodic table by elements with stable forms, a distinction shared with technetium.  Chemically, promethium is a lanthanide, which forms salts when combined with other elements.  Promethium shows only one stable oxidation state of +3. In 1902 Bohuslav Brauner suggested that there was a then-unknown element with properties intermediate between those of the known elements neodymium (60) and samarium (62); this was confirmed in 1914 by Henry Moseley who, having measured the atomic numbers of all the elements then known, found that atomic number 61 was missing. 

Protactinium<====>23322<====>Protactinium Protactinium (formerly protoactinium) is a chemical element with symbol Pa and atomic number 91.  It is a dense, silvery-gray metal which readily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and inorganic acids.  It forms various chemical compounds in which protactinium is usually present in the oxidation state +5, but it can also assume +4 and even +3 or +2 states.  Concentrations of protactinium in the Earth's crust are typically a few parts per trillion, but may reach up to a few parts per million in some uraninite ore deposits.  Because of its scarcity, high radioactivity and high toxicity, there are currently no uses for protactinium outside scientific research, and for this purpose, protactinium is mostly extracted from spent nuclear fuel. 

Platinum<====>23324<====>Platinum   Platinum is a chemical element with symbol Pt and atomic number 78.  It is a dense, malleable, ductile, highly unreactive, precious, silverish-white transition metal.  Its name is derived from the Spanish term platina, meaning "little silver".    Platinum is a member of the platinum group of elements and group 10 of the periodic table of elements.  It has six naturally occurring isotopes.  It is one of the rarer elements in Earth's crust, with an average abundance of approximately 5 μg/kg.  It occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits, mostly in South Africa, which accounts for 80% of the world production. 

Polonium<====>23325<====>Polonium Polonium is a chemical element with symbol Po and atomic number 84.  A rare and highly radioactive metal with no stable isotopes, polonium is chemically similar to selenium and tellurium, though its metallic character resembles that of its horizontal neighbors in the periodic table: thallium, lead, and bismuth.  Due to the short half-life of all its isotopes, its natural occurrence is limited to tiny traces of the fleeting polonium-210 (with a half-life of 138 days) in uranium ores, as it is the penultimate daughter of natural uranium-238.  Though slightly longer-lived isotopes exist, they are much more difficult to produce. 

Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)<====>23326<====>Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany) The Party of Democratic Socialism ( , PDS) was a democratic socialist political party in Germany active between 1989 and 2007.   It was the legal successor to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), which ruled the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) as a one-party state until 1990.   From 1990 through to 2005, the PDS had been seen as the left-wing "party of the East".  While it achieved minimal support in western Germany, it regularly won 15% to 25% of the vote in the eastern new states of Germany, entering coalition governments (with the Social Democratic Party of Germany, SPD) in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Berlin. 

Pythonidae<====>23329<====>Pythonidae The Pythonidae, commonly known simply as pythons, from the Greek word python (πυθων), are a family of nonvenomous   snakes found in Africa, Asia, and Australia.  Among its members are some of the largest snakes in the world.  Eight genera and 31 species are currently recognized.Distribution and habitatPythons are found in sub-Saharan Africa, Nepal, India, Sri Lanka, Burma, southern China, Southeast Asia, and from the Philippines southeast through Indonesia to New Guinea and Australia.  In the United States, an introduced population of Burmese pythons, Python molurus bivittatus, has existed as an invasive species in the Everglades National Park since the late 1990s. 

Pennsylvania<====>23332<====>Pennsylvania  Pennsylvania ( ; Pennsylvania German: Pennsylvaani or Pennsilfaani), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.  The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle.  The Commonwealth is bordered by Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east. Pennsylvania is the 33rd-largest, the 5th-most populous, and the 9th-most densely populated of the 50 United States. 

Palimpsest<====>23333<====>Palimpsest  In textual studies, a palimpsest ( ) is a manuscript page, either from a scroll or a book, from which the text has been scraped or washed off so that the page can be reused for another document.   Pergamene (now known as parchment) was made of baby lamb or kid skin (best made in ancient Pergamon) and was expensive and not readily available, so in the interest of economy a pergamene often was re-used by scraping the previous writing.  In colloquial usage, the term palimpsest is also used in architecture, archaeology, and geomorphology to denote an object made or worked upon for one purpose and later reused for another, for example a monumental brass the reverse blank side of which has been re-engraved. 

Pergamon<====>23334<====>Pergamon Pergamon   or   or Pergamum   (  or  ) was a rich and powerful  ancient Greek city in Aeolis.  It is located   from the modern coastline of the Aegean Sea on a promontory on the north side of the river Caicus (modern-day Bakırçay) and northwest of the modern city of Bergama. Many remains of its impressive monuments can still be seen and especially the outstanding masterpiece of the Pergamon Altar.  It became the capital of the Kingdom of Pergamon during the Hellenistic period under the Attalid dynasty in 281–133 BC. 

Parsec<====>23335<====>Parsec  The parsec (symbol: pc) is a unit of length used to measure large distances to astronomical objects outside the Solar System.  A parsec was defined as the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends an angle of one arcsecond,  but it was redefined in 2015 to exactly   astronomical units.  One parsec is equal to about 3. 26 light-years (30 trillion km or 19 trillion miles) in length.  The nearest star, Proxima Centauri, is about   from the Sun.   Most of the stars visible to the unaided eye in the night sky are within 500 parsecs of the Sun. 

Parchment<====>23336<====>Parchment Parchment is a writing material made from specially prepared untanned skins of animals—primarily sheep, calves, and goats.  It has been used as a writing medium for over two millennia.  Vellum is a finer quality parchment made from the skins of young animals such as lambs and young calves. It may be called animal membrane by libraries and museums that wish to avoid distinguishing between "parchment" and the more restricted term "vellum" (see below). Parchment and vellumToday the term "parchment" is often used in non-technical contexts to refer to any animal skin, particularly goat, sheep or cow, that has been scraped or dried under tension. 

Phobia<====>23337<====>Phobia   A phobia is a type of anxiety disorder, defined by a persistent fear of an object or situation.The phobia typically results in a rapid onset of fear and is present for more than six months.   The affected person will go to great lengths to avoid the situation or object, typically to a degree greater than the actual danger posed.   If the feared object or situation cannot be avoided, the affected person will have significant distress.   With blood or injury phobia, fainting may occur.   Agoraphobia is often associated with panic attacks. 

Pittsburgh Steelers<====>23338<====>Pittsburgh Steelers    The Pittsburgh Steelers are a professional American football team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The Steelers compete in the National Football League (NFL), as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) North division.  Founded in  , the Steelers are the oldest franchise in the AFC. In contrast with their status as perennial also-rans in the pre-merger NFL, where they were the oldest team never to win a league championship, the Steelers of the post-merger (modern) era are one of the most successful NFL franchises.  Pittsburgh has won more Super Bowl titles (6) and both played in (16) and hosted more conference championship games (11) than any other NFL team. 

Philadelphia Eagles<====>23339<====>Philadelphia Eagles  The Philadelphia Eagles are a professional American football franchise based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The Eagles compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The franchise was established in 1933 as a replacement for the bankrupt Frankford Yellow Jackets, when a group led by Bert Bell secured the rights to an NFL franchise in Philadelphia.  Bell, Chuck Bednarik, Bob Brown, Reggie White, Steve Van Buren, Tommy McDonald, Greasy Neale, Pete Pihos, Sonny Jurgensen, and Norm Van Brocklin have been inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 

Paganism<====>23340<====>Paganism    Paganism is a term first used in the fourth century by early Christianity for populations of the Roman Empire who practiced polytheism, either because they were increasingly rural and provincial relative to the Christian population or because they were not milites Christi (soldiers of Christ).  J.  J.  O'Donnell (1977), Paganus: Evolution and Use, Classical Folia, 31: 163–69.    Alternate terms in Christian texts for the same group were hellene and gentile.  Pagan and paganism were pejorative terms for the same polytheistic group, implying its inferiority.Paganism has broadly connoted the "religion of the peasantry",  and for much of its history was a derogatory term.

Pokey the Penguin<====>23345<====>Pokey the Penguin  Pokey the Penguin is an online comic strip created in 1998.  It chronicles the adventures of a penguin named Pokey and a large cast of other characters.   Pokey comics are drawn crudely and minimalistically, and they consist largely of a string of non-sequiturs and absurd journeys, with a token effort towards more traditional plots and continuity (such as the conflict with the Italians over arctic-circle candy) that tend to be established through oblique references to off-screen characters and non-events.   Today, new comic strips appear sporadically, although formerly the site was updated daily. 

Post-communism<====>23346<====>Post-communism  Post-communism is the period of political and economic transformation or "transition" in former communist states located in parts of Europe and Asia, in which new governments aimed to create free market-oriented capitalist economies. PoliticsThe policies of most communist parties in both the Eastern and Western Bloc had been governed by the example of the Soviet Union.  In most countries in the Eastern Bloc, following the fall of communist-led governments in 1989, the communist parties split in two factions: a reformist social democratic party and a new, less reform-oriented communist party.  The newly created social democratic parties were generally larger and more powerful than the remaining communist parties; only in Belarus, the Czech Republic, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, and Ukraine did the communist parties remain a significant force. 

Paul Allen<====>23347<====>Paul Allen   Paul Gardner Allen (born January 21, 1953) is an American business magnate, investor and philanthropist.  He co-founded Microsoft alongside Bill Gates.  In June 2017, he was estimated to be the 46th richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $20. 7 billion.  Allen is the founder and Chairman  of Vulcan Inc. , which manages his various business and philanthropic efforts.  Allen has a multibillion-dollar investment portfolio including technology and media companies, real estate holdings, and stakes in other companies.  He owns two professional sports teams: the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League  and the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association,  and is part-owner of the Seattle Sounders FC, which joined Major League Soccer in 2009. 

Pytheas<====>23348<====>Pytheas  Pytheas of Massalia (Ancient Greek: Πυθέας ὁ Μασσαλιώτης Pythéas ho Massaliōtes; Latin: Pytheas Massiliensis; fl.  4th century BC), was a Greek geographer and explorer from the Greek colony of Massalia (modern-day Marseille).  He made a voyage of exploration to northwestern Europe in about 325 BC, but his description of it, widely known in Antiquity, has not survived. In this voyage he circumnavigated and visited a considerable part of Great Britain.  He is the first person on record to describe the Midnight Sun.  The theoretical existence of a Frigid Zone, and temperate zones where the nights are very short in summer and the sun does not set at the summer solstice, was already known. 

Polygonales<====>23359<====>Polygonales Polygonales was an order of flowering plants recognized by several older systems such as the Wettstein system, last revised in 1935, the Engler system, in its update of 1964, and the Cronquist system, 1981. Its circumscription was typically: order Polygonalesfamily PolygonaceaeIn these systems the order is placed close to the order Caryophyllales (or its predecessor Centrospermae). Cronquist placed this order in his subclass Caryophyllidae of three orders. Dahlgren placed the order Polygonales within the superorder Polygoniflorae, alternatively Polygonanae.

Polygonaceae<====>23361<====>Polygonaceae The Polygonaceae are a family of flowering plants known informally as the knotweed family or smartweed—buckwheat family in the United States.  The name is based on the genus Polygonum, and was first used by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1789 in his book, Genera Plantarum.  Antoine Laurent de Jussieu.  1789.  Genera plantarum: secundum ordines naturales disposita, juxta methodum in Horto regio parisiensi exaratam.  page 82.  Herrisant and Barrois: Paris, France.  (see External links below)  The name refers to the many swollen nodes the stems of some species have.  It is derived from Greek; poly means many and goni means knee or joint. 

History of Pakistan<====>23362<====>History of Pakistan    The history of Pakistan ( ) encompasses the history of the region constituting modern-day Pakistan.  For over three millennia, the region has witnessed human activity    and one of the world's major civilizations,   the Indus Valley Civilisation.  The trade routes which traverse the Indus Valley linking Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent and the Orient have attracted people from as far as Greece and Mongolia  and countless imperial powers, the last being the British Empire. History by chronology and region  PrehistoryPaleolithic periodThe Riwatian is a Paleolithic site in upper Punjab. 

Geography of Pakistan<====>23363<====>Geography of Pakistan The Geography of Pakistan ( ) is a profound blend of landscapes varying from plains to deserts, forests, hills, and plateaus ranging from the coastal areas of the Arabian Sea in the south to the mountains of the Karakoram range in the north.  Pakistan geologically overlaps both with the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates where its Sindh and Punjab provinces lie on the north-western corner of the Indian plate while Balochistan and most of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa lie within the Eurasian plate which mainly comprises the Iranian Plateau.  Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir lie along the edge of the Indian plate and hence are prone to violent earthquakes where the two tectonic plates collide. 

Demographics of Pakistan<====>23364<====>Demographics of PakistanPakistan's latest estimated population is 207,774,520 (excluding autonomous regions Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan).   This makes Pakistan the world's fifth-most-populous country, just behind Indonesia and slightly ahead of Brazil.  Including Azad Kashmir, the population would be 211. 819 million.  Gilgit Baltistan region has an additional estimated population of 1. 8 million. During 1950–2011, Pakistan's urban population expanded over sevenfold, while the total population increased by over fourfold.  In the past, the country's population had a relatively high growth rate that has been changed by moderate birth rates.  Between 1998-2017, the average population growth rate stood at 2. 

Politics of Pakistan<====>23365<====>Politics of Pakistan  The politics of Pakistan takes place within the framework established by the constitution.  The country is a federal parliamentary republic in which provincial governments enjoy a high degree of autonomy and residuary powers.  Executive power is vested with the national cabinet which is headed by the prime minister, who works coherently along with the bicameral parliament and the judicature.   Stipulations set by the constitution provide a delicate check and balance of sharing powers between executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the government.  The head of state is the president who is elected by the electoral college for a five-year term. 

Economy of Pakistan<====>23366<====>Economy of Pakistan   The economy of Pakistan is the 24th largest in the world in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), and 42nd largest in terms of nominal gross domestic product.  Pakistan has a population of over 207 million   (the world's 5th-largest), giving it a nominal GDP per capita of $1,629,  which ranks 147th in the world for 2016.  However, Pakistan's undocumented economy is estimated to be 36% of its overall economy, which is not taken into consideration when calculating per capita income.   Pakistan is a developing countryand is one of the Next Eleven, the eleven countries that have a potential to be among the world's large economies in the 21st century. 

Telecommunications in Pakistan<====>23367<====>Telecommunications in PakistanTelecommunications in Pakistan describes the overall environment for the growing mobile telecommunications, telephone, and Internet markets in Pakistan. In 2008 Pakistan was the world's third-fastest growing telecommunications market.  Pakistan's telecom infrastructure is improving dramatically with foreign and domestic investments into fixed-line and mobile networks; fiber systems are being constructed throughout the country to aid in network growth.  Regulatory environmentThe Telecommunications Ordinance of 1994 created the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), Pakistan's first independent telecommunications regulator, and the Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd (PTCL), a state-owned monopoly.  Due to a lack of competition, local telephone call rates were high and international call rates were even higher. 

Transport in Pakistan<====>23368<====>Transport in Pakistan Transport in Pakistan ( ) is extensive and varied, and serves a population of over 191 million people.  In recent years, new national highways have been built, with the addition of motorways which have improved trade and logistics within the country.  Much of Pakistan's rail network railway was built before 1947, mainly during the British Raj.  Airports and seaports have been built with the addition of foreign and domestic funding. Human/Animal poweredIn small towns and farms, many walk great distances to work or shop. Bicycles are used by either the poor or for leisure due to its economy and simplicity. 

Pakistan Armed Forces<====>23369<====>Pakistan Armed ForcesThe Pakistan Armed Forces ( , Musallah Afwaj-e-Pakistan) are the military forces of Pakistan.  They are the sixth largest in the world in terms of active military personnel and the largest among Muslim countries.  The armed forces comprise three main service branches – Army, Navy, and Air Force – together with a number of paramilitary forces and the Strategic Plans Division Force.   Chain of command of the military is organized under the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (JCSC) alongside chiefs of staff of the army, navy, and air force. 

Foreign relations of Pakistan<====>23370<====>Foreign relations of Pakistan  Pakistan is the second largest Muslim-majority country in terms of population (after Indonesia ) and its status as a declared nuclear power, being the only Islamic nation to have that status, plays a part in its international role. Pakistan has a fiercely independent foreign policy, especially when it comes to issues such as development of nuclear weapons, construction of nuclear reactors, foreign military purchases and other issues that are vital to its national interests.  On the other hand, Pakistan's economy is rather integrated into the world with strong ties to the EU and economic aliances and agreements with many other Asian nations.

The country contains approximately 340 islands, forming the western chain of the Caroline Islands in Micronesia, and has an area of  .   The most populous island is Koror.  The capital Ngerulmud is located on the nearby island of Babeldaob, in Melekeok State.  Palau shares maritime boundaries with Indonesia, the Philippines, and the Federated States of Micronesia. The country was originally settled approximately 3,000 years ago by migrants from the Philippines and sustained a Negrito population until around 900 years ago. 

History of Palau<====>23373<====>History of Palau Palau was initially settled around 1000 BC. For the first time, Palau was probably sighted by Europeans early as 1522, when the Spanish mission of the Trinidad, the flagship of Ferdinand Magellan's voyage of circumnavigation, sighted two small islands around the 5th parallel north, naming them "San Juan" without visiting them. Palau was truly discovered by the Europeans on 28 December 1696 when the first map of Palau was drawn by the Czech missionary Paul Klein    based on a description given by a group of Palauans shipwrecked on the Philippine coast on Samar.  This map and a letter sent to Europe by Klein in June 1697 had a vast impact on the surge of interest in Palau.

Pre-Columbian historyThe earliest artifacts discovered in Panama have included Paleo-Indians projectile points.   Later central Panama was home to some of the first pottery-making in the Americas, such as the Monagrillo cultures dating to about 2500–1700 BC.   These evolved into significant populations that are best known through the spectacular burials (dating to c.  500–900 AD) at the Monagrillo archaeological site, and the beautiful polychrome pottery of the Gran Coclé style.

History of Papua New Guinea<====>23401<====>History of Papua New Guinea   The prehistory of Papua New Guinea can be traced back to about 60,000 years ago when people first migrated towards the Australian continent.  The written history began when European navigators first sighted New Guinea in the early part of the 16th century. Archaeology Archaeological evidence indicates that humans arrived on New Guinea perhaps 60,000 years ago, although this is under debate.    They came probably by sea from Southeast Asia during an Ice Age period when the sea was lower and distances between islands shorter.  Although the first arrivals were hunters and gatherers, early evidence shows that people managed the forest environment to provide food. 

Geography of Papua New Guinea<====>23402<====>Geography of Papua New GuineaThe geography of Papua New Guinea describes the eastern half of the island of New Guinea, the islands of New Ireland, New Britain and Bougainville, and smaller nearby islands.   Together these make up the nation of Papua New Guinea in tropical Oceania, located in the western edge of the Pacific Ocean. Papua New Guinea is largely mountainous, and much of it is covered with tropical rainforest.   The New Guinea Highlands runs the length of New Guinea, and the highest areas receive snowfall - a rarity in the tropics.   Within Papua New Guinea Mount Wilhelm is the highest peak, at 4,509 m (14,793 ft). 

Demographics of Papua New Guinea<====>23403<====>Demographics of Papua New Guinea The indigenous population of Papua New Guinea is one of the most heterogeneous in the world.  Papua New Guinea has several thousand separate communities, most with only a few hundred people.  Divided by language, customs, and tradition, some of these communities have engaged in endemic warfare with their neighbors for centuries.  It is the second most populous nation in Oceania. The isolation created by the mountainous terrain is so great that some groups, until recently, were unaware of the existence of neighboring groups only a few kilometers away.  The diversity, reflected in a folk saying, "For each village, a different culture", is perhaps best shown in the local languages. 

Politics of Papua New Guinea<====>23404<====>Politics of Papua New Guinea The politics of Papua New Guinea takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic multi-party system, whereby the Prime Minister is the head of government.  Papua New Guinea is an independent Commonwealth realm, with a governor-general, nominated by the National Parliament, acting as head of state.  Executive power is exercised by the government.  Legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament. Constitutional safeguards include freedom of speech, press, worship, movement, and association.  The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. Executive branchThe Head of the Commonwealth, or simply Queen of Papua New Guinea, is represented in Papua New Guinea by a governor general who acts on the advice of the prime minister and the cabinet.

Radios: 410,000 (1997). TelevisionTwo free-to-air television networks, limited to larger population centres or areas where mine sites, or local community groups have decided to redistribute the signal: EM TV - commercial, owned by Fiji Television, started in 1987 but bought off by Telikom PNG in 2014 andKundu 2 - state owned, started in 2008. 

Transport in Papua New Guinea<====>23407<====>Transport in Papua New GuineaTransport in Papua New Guinea is in many cases heavily limited by the mountainous terrain.   The capital, Port Moresby, is not linked by road to any of the other major towns and many highland villages can only be reached by light aircraft or on foot. GovernanceOne of the key recommendations of the 1964 World Bank mission was the creation of a new department to manage the development of all transport modes.   While many of the World Bank mission's recommendations were much argued both locally and internationally, this proposal was widely accepted as it was clear that both political and economic advancement depended on greatly improved land, sea and air transport. 

Papua New Guinea Defence Force<====>23408<====>Papua New Guinea Defence Force  The Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) is the military organisation responsible for the defence of Papua New Guinea.  It originated from the Australian Army land forces of the territory of Papua New Guinea before independence, coming into being in January 1973 and having its antecedents in the Pacific Islands Regiment.  The PNGDF is a small force numbering around 2,500 personnel and consists of a Land Element, an Air Element and a Maritime Element.  It is a joint force tasked with defending Papua New Guinea and its territories against external attack, as well as having secondary functions including national-building and internal security tasks. 

Paracel Islands<====>23410<====>Paracel Islands    The Paracel Islands, also known as Xisha in Chinese and Hoàng Sa in Vietnamese, is a group of islands, reefs, banks and other maritime features in the South China Sea.  It is controlled (and occupied) by the People's Republic of China, and also claimed by Taiwan (Republic of China) and Vietnam. The archipelago includes about 130 small coral islands and reefs, most grouped into the northeast Amphitrite Group or the western Crescent Group.   They are distributed over a maritime area of around  , with a land area of approximately  . 

Paraguay<====>23420<====>Paraguay    Paraguay ( ;  ;  ,  ), officially the Republic of Paraguay (  ;   ), is a landlocked country in central South America, bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest, Brazil to the east and northeast, and Bolivia to the northwest.  Paraguay lies on both banks of the Paraguay River, which runs through the center of the country from north to south.  Due to its central location in South America, it is sometimes referred to as Corazón de Sudamérica ("Heart of South America").   Paraguay is one of the two landlocked countries (the other is Bolivia) outside Afro-Eurasia, and is the smallest  landlocked country in the Americas. 

History of Paraguay<====>23421<====>History of Paraguay The history of Paraguay is a result of development and interaction of varying cultures of indigenous peoples in Paraguay and overseas immigrants who together have created the modern-day Paraguay.  Paraguay celebrates Independence Day on May 14, from 1811 to now. William E.  Barrett wrote:  "Paraguay is the country of prophecy.  One of the two smallest nations [as of 1952] on the American continent, it was the first American communistic state, the first American nation to be governed by an absolute dictator (in the modern sense of the term). " Overview The first Spaniards reached this territory in early 16th century as part of colonial expeditions that created the global Spanish Empire. 

Geography of Paraguay<====>23422<====>Geography of ParaguayParaguay is a landlocked country in South America, bordering Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia.  The Paraguay River (Spanish: Río Paraguay) divides the country into strikingly different eastern and western regions.  Both the eastern region (officially called Eastern Paraguay, Paraguay Oriental, and known as the Paraneña region) and the western region (officially Western Paraguay, Paraguay Occidental, and known as the Chaco) gently slope toward and are drained into the Paraguay River, which separates and unifies the two regions.  With the Paraneña region reaching southward and the Chaco extending to the north, Paraguay straddles the Tropic of Capricorn and experiences both subtropical and tropical climates. 

Demographics of Paraguay<====>23423<====>Demographics of Paraguay  This article discusses the demographic features of the population of Paraguay, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population. facesParaguay's population is distributed unevenly through the country.  The vast majority of the people live in the eastern region, most within   of Asunción, the capital and largest city, which borders on Argentina to the south and west.  The Gran Chaco in the north-west, which accounts for about 60% of Paraguayan territory, is home to less than 2% of the population.  The Paraguay government encouraged  massive settlement of the vast Gran Chaco. 

Politics of Paraguay<====>23424<====>Politics of Paraguay  Politics of Paraguay takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic (The National Constitution mandates a separation of powers in three branches.  Executive power is exercised solely by the President.  Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of the National Congress.  The Judiciary power is vested on Tribunals and Courts of Civil Law and a nine-member Supreme Court of Justice, all of them independent of the executive and the legislature. The Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Paraguay as "flawed democracy" in 2016.  ConstitutionParaguay's highly public government was fundamentally changed by the 1992 constitution, which reinforced a division of powers that in the last two Constitutions existed mostly in writing. 

Economy of Paraguay<====>23425<====>Economy of Paraguay    Paraguay has a market economy  highly dependent on agriculture products.  In recent years, the economy has grown as a result of increased agricultural exports, especially soybeans.  Paraguay has the economic advantages of a young population and vast hydroelectric power but has few mineral resources, and political instability has undercut some of the economic advantages present.  The government welcomes foreign investment.  Paraguay country profile.  Library of Congress Federal Research Division (October 2005).

Paraguay is a middle-income country that changed rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s as a result of hydroelectric development, agricultural colonization, construction, and cash crop exports. 

Telecommunications in Paraguay<====>23426<====>Telecommunications in Paraguay Telecommunications in Paraguay are meager.  Paraguay has the lowest fixed-line telephone density in South America, with 5. 6 lines per 100 residents, compared with 8. 7 per 100 in Bolivia, 21. 9 in Brazil, and 24. 9 in Argentina.  TelephonesThe state-owned Corporación Paraguaya de Comunicaciones (Copaco) is known for inefficiency and overstaffing.  Privatization was attempted in 2002, but failed in the midst of the banking scandal.   With only 5. 6 percent of the population having access to a land-line connection,  the meager telephone network has resulted in rapid growth in mobile phone use. 

Transport in Paraguay<====>23427<====>Transport in ParaguayParaguay’s transportation system ranges from adequate to poor, largely depending on the region of the country.  The country has a network of roads, railroads, rivers, and airports, but significant infrastructure and regulation improvements are needed.  Paraguay country profile.

Roads in ParaguayEstimates vary on the total extent of Paraguay’s road system, from more than   to less than  .  The discrepancies seem to be the result of differing standards regarding what constitutes a road. 

Armed Forces of Paraguay<====>23428<====>Armed Forces of Paraguay The Armed forces of Paraguay ( ) consist of the Paraguayan army, navy (including naval aviation and marine corps) and air force. The constitution of Paraguay establishes the president of Paraguay as the commander-in-chief. Paraguay has compulsory military service, and all 18-year-old males and 17-year-olds in the year of their 18th birthday are liable for one year of active duty.  Although the 1992 constitution allows for conscientious objection, no enabling legislation has yet been approved. In July 2005, military aid in the form of U. S.  Special Forces began arriving at Paraguay's Mariscal Estigarribia air base, a sprawling complex built in 1982. 

Foreign relations of Paraguay<====>23429<====>Foreign relations of Paraguay Paraguayan foreign policy has concentrated on maintaining good relations with its neighbors, and it has been an active proponent of regional co-operation.  It is a member of the United Nations and has served one term in the UN Security Council in 1967-1969 .  It maintains membership in several international financial institutions, including the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.  It also belongs to the Organization of American States, the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI), the Rio Group, INTERPOL, MERCOSUR (the Southern Cone Common Market) and UNASURAt the political level, diplomatic affairs and international relations of Paraguay are officially handled by the Ministry of Foreign Relations, which answers to the executive branch of the government. 

History of Peru<====>23431<====>History of Peru The history of Peru spans 4 millennia, extending back through several stages of cultural development in the mountain region and the coastal desert.  About 15,200 years ago, groups of people are believed to have crossed the Bering Strait from Asia and survived as nomads, hunting, gathering fruits and vegetables and fishing in the sea, rivers, and lakes.  Peruvian territory was home to the Norte Chico civilization, one of the six oldest in the world, and to the Inca Empire, the largest state in Pre-Columbian America.  It was conquered by the Spanish Empire in the 16th century, which established a Viceroyalty with jurisdiction over most of its South American domains. 

Geography of Peru<====>23432<====>Geography of Peru  Peru is a country on the central western coast of South America facing the Pacific Ocean.Statistics Area: land:1,279,999 km² water:5,220 km²Maritime claims: continental shelf:   territorial sea: Land use: arable land:3% permanent crops:0.5% permanent pastures:21% forests and woodland:66% other:9.5% (1993 est.)Irrigated land:12,800 km² (1993 est.)Natural hazards:earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, landslides, mild volcanic activityEnvironment - current issues:deforestation (some the result of illegal logging); overgrazing of the slopes of the coast and sierra leading to soil erosion; desertification; air pollution in Lima; pollution of rivers and coastal waters from municipal and mining wastesEnvironment - international agreements: party to:Antarctic Treaty, Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling	 signed, but not ratified:Climate Change-Kyoto ProtocolGeography - note:shares control of Lake Titicaca, world's highest navigable lake, with BoliviaClimate The combination of tropical latitude, mountain ranges, topography variations and two ocean currents (Humboldt and El Niño) gives Peru a large diversity of climates. Perù has a tropical climate with a wet and dry season.Amazon Basin or Low AmazonThe eastern portions of Peru include the Amazon Basin or selva baja, a region that is larger in the north than in the south. Representing roughly 60% of Peru's national territory, this area includes the Amazon, Marañón, Huallaga and Ucayali Rivers. It is a vast tropical forest with countless rivers and streams.Almost 60% of the country's area is located within this region,  ( ) giving Peru the fourth largest area of tropical forest in the world after Brazil, Congo and Indonesia.   Andean Mountain RangesThe Andes shelter the very largest variety of climates in the country. The climate is semi-arid in the valleys and moist in higher elevations and towards the eastern flanks. Rainfall varies from   per year. The rainy season starts in October and ends in April. The rainiest months are January through March where travel can be sometimes affected.The western slopes are arid to semi-arid and receive rainfall only between January and March. Below the   mark, the temperatures vary between   in the night versus   in the day.Between   the temperatures vary from   in the night and from   during the day. At higher elevations from  , the Puna ecoregion, the temperature varies from   during the night versus   during the day.The northernmost regions of the Andes around Cajamarca and Piura regions have Páramo climates.CoastThe Peruvian coast is a microclimatic region. The region is affected by the cold Humboldt Current, the El Niño Southern Oscillation, tropical latitude, and the Andes mountain range.The central and southern coast consists mainly of a subtropical desert climate composed of sandy or rocky shores and inland cutting valleys. Days alternate between overcast skies with occasional fog in the winter and sunny skies with occasional haze in the summer, with the only precipitation being an occasional light-to-moderate drizzle that is known locally as garúa.  These regions are usually characterized by having mildy cold lows ( ) and also mild highs ( ). Temperatures rarely fall below   and do not go over  . An exception is the southern coast, where it does get a bit warmer and drier for most of the year during daytime, and where it can also get much colder during winter nights ( ). The occasional drizzle or fog of the central and southern coast is common during winter months, but even during summer days there are some foggy days. One must not forget that although it may not be as warm as typical tropical latitudes, the sun will hit and strike as if you were in any other tropical place.The northern coast, on the contrary, has a curious tropical-dry climate, generally referred to as tropical savanna. This region is a lot warmer and can be unbearable during summer months, where rainfall is also present. The region differs from the southern coast by the presence of shrubs, equatorial dry forests (Tumbes-Piura dry forests ecoregion), mangrove forests, tropical valleys near rivers such as the Chira and the Tumbes, and is blessed with clear, sunny skies for most of the year. The average temperature is  .Central & Southern CoastThe central and southern coast have a subtropical desert climate, despite this region being located in the tropics. The Humboldt Current, serving as one cause of climactic differentiation, is   colder than normal tropical seas at  , thus preventing high tropical temperatures from appearing. Additionally, due to the height of the Andes cordillera, there is no passage of hot clouds from the Amazon to the coast, the climate is cooler than that of similar tropical latitudes. This can create a great deal of humidity and fog during winter months.Moreover, the Andes mountains are very close to the coast, a geographic factor that prevents cumulus or cumulonimbus clouds from appearing. Therefore, a shade effect is created, causing very low annual rainfall in this region. Rainfall averages   per year near the Chilean border to   per year on the northern coast and nearer the Andes.The central coast is composed of regions including La Libertad, Ancash and Lima, which have a spring-like climate for most of the year. Foggy and sunny days intermingle around the humid sand dunes during most of the year.Most summers (February–April) have pleasant temperatures ranging from   during the night to about   during daytime.  Winters (August–October) are very humid, and range from   during the nights to around the   during the day. The spring (November–January) and autumn (May–July) months have a pleasant climate that ranges from   during the day to around   during the night. Moving inland  into the Yunga valleys, the climate tends to be ~  drier and warmer during any given month.The southern coast, composed of the Ica, Arequipa, Moquegua and Tacna regions, has a drier and warmer climate during the day for all seasons, although colder in winter. There are regions famous for their sand dunes and impressive deserts that are, in part, caused by the drier and hotter climate. Temperatures in this region can reach up to   in the Nazca region while inland regions can fall to   during the winter months. During the day, temperatures rarely go below the   for all months of the year. This purports the idea that the southern coast has a more desert-like climate, although daily temperature variations exist as they do in other regions within tropical latitudes. Clear skies are often present in desert areas and, although less common, near the coastal cliffs as well, which are home to a variety of fish and marine mammals.Northern CoastThe northern coast consists of the eastern region of Lambayeque, the Piura Region and the Tumbes Region.They are characterized by having different climate and geographyfrom the rest of the coast. Right between the 3 hour drive on the Sechura desert, which is located north of the Lambayeque Region and south of the Piura Region, is the evidence ofclimate change from the common subtropical desert found on the south to visible tropicalization effects of the tropical dry climate or tropical savanna. Examples of this are thetropical dry forests that begin to appear. They are composed ofshrubs, thorny trees, carrob trees, faique trees, huayacan trees, hualtaco trees, palo santo trees, ceibo trees and on the coastmangrove forests. It is also a biodiverse area where typical wildlife can be observed such as crocodiles, reptiles, iguanas, boas, pava aliblanca, anteater, bear, sloth (bearh) and many more.This climatical reasons for change are the presence of the warm Niño Current during the summer months (December to April), the eventualEl Niño Phenomenon and the passing of Amazon Jungles clouds due to mountain openings and lower altitudes of the Andes Chain. Theseare the causes for a climate change in a short two- or three-hour trajectory that is visible between the Lambayeque Region and the Sechura Province, where not only geography changes but a temperature rise of   or more depending on the month. It is directly off the shores of the Sechura Region where the cold Humboldt current and warm el Niño current meet, at about 5° to 6° south of the equator. From this point warm temperatures are most common, and there are no true winters. Average temperatures range between  . Clear skies, beautiful warm valleys, eroded terrains with reddish colored sands, rice fields, palm trees, savannas, bushy forests, dense rivers, beautiful warm turquoise beaches, orangey or yellowish terrains, clearer sands and a sun that hits like the African plateau,where shade is almost impossible.Summer (December through March) is more humid and very hot, with average temperatures that vary from   during the night to around   during the day, although north of Lambayeque it can reach the  . Winters (June–September) are cooler during the nights; around   during the night, to around   during the daytime.There are protected areas in Tumbes and Piura filled with tropical canelo forests and tropical dry forests such as Caza de Coto and Cerros de Amotape, both extending into southern Ecuador. The areas of eastern Lambayeque also have  tropical dry forests, which are found in the Chaparri and Chongoyape provinces. These forests have the particularity of connecting to the Amazon basin through the Marañon passage (an area where there are also tropical dry forests). Mangrove forests are located in four specific areas from Sechura to Tumbes.In these regions there are mangrove forests at the ending strips of the Piura River in the Sechura Province (the southernmost mangroves in the Pacific Ocean). To the north the ending strips of the Chira River, Tumbes River, and Zarumilla River also have mangrove forests that flow into the ocean.Terrain:western coastal plain (costa), high and rugged Andes in center (sierra), eastern lowland jungle of Amazon Basin (selva).Natural resources:copper, silver, gold, petroleum, timber, fish, iron ore, coal, phosphate, potash, hydropower.Extreme pointsThis is a list of the extreme points of Peru, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.Northernmost point: Putumayo River ( ) in the Putumayo District, Maynas Province, Loreto RegionSouthernmost point: Pacific shore  ( ) in the Tacna District, Tacna Province, Tacna RegionWesternmost point: Punta Pariñas ( ) in the La Brea District, Talara Province, Piura RegionEasternmost point: Mouth of the Heath River ( ) in the Tambopata District, Tambopata Province, Madre de Dios RegionAntipodesParts of northern and southern Peru are antipodal to Southeast Asia. The north near the border with Ecuador is opposite much of Malaya, including the east coast and Penang, and the adjacent part of the Kra Peninsula in Thailand, whereas many of the Riau Islands of Indonesia are antipodal to the northern Peruvian Amazon. Southern Vietnam up to just north of Huế is antipodal to the southern Peruvian Amazon and Andes, with Saigon close to Atalaya, Peru, and Cuzco close to Pleiku, Vietnam. Cambodia apart from the westernmost part is antipodal to the Andes and the coast, including Lima, with Ayacucho not far from Stung Treng, and Huancayo not far from the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh. The famous Cambodian ruins of Ankor Wat are directly antipodal to the Peruvian city of Chincha Alta. The eastern corner of Thailand corresponds to coastal Peru around Nazca, and the south of Laos is antipodal to the coastal area just south of that.

Demographics of Peru<====>23433<====>Demographics of Peru   This article is about the demographic features of the population of Peru, including population density, ethnicity, education level, the health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population. Peru is a multiethnic country, which means that it is home to people of many different historical backgrounds.  Therefore, it is a multicultural country as well.  Since it is a multiethnic society, Peruvian people usually treat their nationality as a citizenship instead of an ethnicity.  The Peruvian census does not contain information about ethnicity so only rough estimates are available. 

Politics of Peru<====>23434<====>Politics of Peru  The politics of the Republic of Peru takes place in a framework of a unitary semi-presidential representative democratic republic,  whereby the President of Peru is both head of state and head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system.  Executive power is exercised by the President and the Government.  Legislative power is vested in both the Government and the Congress.  The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.  The Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Peru as "flawed democracy" in 2016.

Economy of Peru<====>23435<====>Economy of PeruBiggest exports are hats and llamas    Peru is classified as upper middle income by the World Bank  and is the 39th largest in the world by total GDP.   Peru is one of the world's fastest-growing economies with a 2012 GDP growth rate of 6. 3%.   It currently has a high human development index of 0. 741 and per capita GDP above $12,000 by PPP.  Neo-classical economists would interpret Peru's sound economic performance as a combination of:Macroeconomic stabilityPrudent fiscal spendingHigh international reserve accumulationExternal debt reductionAchievement of investment grade statusFiscal surplusesHowever, Post-Keynesian economists would argue that what neo-classical economics considers to be "prudent" fiscal spending is nothing more than a means to restrict government spending in order to make Peru dependent on export income and thus encourage it to open the Peruvian economy to free trade to the benefit of other western countries.

It is the second highest railway in the world (following opening of the Qingzang railway in Tibet), with the Galera summit tunnel under Mount Meiggs at   and Galera station at   above sea level.  In 1955 the railway opened a spur line from La Cima on the Morococha branch (  above sea level) to Volcán Mine, reaching an (at the time) world record altitude of  . 

Peruvian Armed Forces<====>23438<====>Peruvian Armed Forces  The Peruvian Armed Forces ( ) are the military services of Peru, comprising independent Army, Navy and Air Force components.  Their primary mission is to safeguard the country's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity against any threat.  As a secondary mission they participate in economic and social development as well as in civil defense tasks.   The National Police of Peru is often classified as a part of the armed forces.  Although in fact it has a different organisation and a wholly civil mission, its training and activities over more than two decades as an anti-terrorist force have produced markedly military characteristics, giving it the appearance of a virtual fourth military service with significant land, sea and air capabilities and approximately 140,000 personnel. 

Foreign relations of Peru<====>23439<====>Foreign relations of Peru Peru is an important second-tier state in South America,  Peru has been a member of the United Nations since 1949, and Peruvian Javier Pérez de Cuéllar served as UN Secretary General from 1981 to 1991.  Former President Fujimori’s tainted re-election to a third term in June 2000 strained Peru's relations with the United States and with many Latin American and European countries, but relations improved with the installation of an interim government in November 2000 and the inauguration of Alejandro Toledo in July 2001. Peru is planning full integration into the Andean Free Trade Area. 

Philippines<====>23440<====>Philippines  The Philippines ( ;or    ), officially the Republic of the Philippines ( )  is a unitary sovereign state and island country in Southeast Asia.  Situated in the western Pacific Ocean, it consists of about 7,641 islands  that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.  The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila.   Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south. 

History of the Philippines<====>23441<====>History of the Philippines    The history of the Philippines is believed to have begun with the arrival of the first humans   using rafts or boats at least 67,000 years ago as the 2007 discovery of Callao Man suggested.   Negrito groups first inhabited the isles.  Groups of Austronesians later migrated to the islands. Scholars generally believe that these social groups eventually developed into various settlements or polities with varying degrees of economic specialization, social stratification, and political organization. Some of these settlements (mostly those located on major river deltas) achieved such a scale of social complexity that some scholars believe they should be considered early states.

The 11 largest islands contain 95% of the total land area.  The largest of these islands is Luzon at about  .  The next largest island is Mindanao at about  .  The archipelago is around   from the Asian mainland and is located between Taiwan and Borneo. The Philippine archipelago is divided into three island groups: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.  The Luzon islands include Luzon itself, Palawan, Mindoro, Marinduque, Masbate, Romblon, Catanduanes, Batanes and Polilio. 

Demographics of the Philippines<====>23443<====>Demographics of the Philippines  Demography of the Philippines records the human population, including its population density, ethnicity, education level, health, economic status, religious affiliations, and other aspects.  The Philippines annualised population growth rate between the years 2010-2015 was 1. 72%.According to the 2015 census, the population of the Philippines is 100,981,437.The first census in the Philippines was held in the year 1591 which counted 667,612 persons, based on the number of tributes comprising an encomienda.  The majority of Filipinos are made up of various ethnolinguistic Austronesian groups, while the Aetas, as well as other highland groups form a minority. 

Politics of the Philippines<====>23444<====>Politics of the Philippines Elections are administered by an independent Commission on Elections every three years starting 1992.  Held every second Monday of May, the winners in the elections take office on the following June 30. Local government is produced by local government units from the provinces, cities, municipalities and barangays.  While the most regions do not have political power, and exist merely for administration purposes, autonomous regions have expanded powers more than the other local government units.  While local government units enjoy autonomy, much of their budget is derived from allocations from the national government, putting their true autonomy in doubt. 

Economy of the Philippines<====>23445<====>Economy of the Philippines  The Economy of the Philippines is the world's 34th largest economy by nominal GDP according to the 2017 estimate of the International Monetary Fund's statistics, it is the 13th largest economy in Asia, and the 3rd largest economy in the ASEAN after Indonesia and Thailand.  The Philippines is one of the emerging markets and is the sixth richest in Southeast Asia by GDP per capita values, after the regional countries of Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.  The Philippines is primarily considered a newly industrialized country, which has an economy transitioning from one based on agriculture to one based more on services and manufacturing. 

Telecommunications in the Philippines<====>23446<====>Telecommunications in the PhilippinesTelecommunications in the Philippines are well-developed due to the presence of modern infrastructure facilities.

Transportation in the Philippines<====>23447<====>Transportation in the PhilippinesTransportation in the Philippines is relatively underdeveloped, partly due to the country's mountainous areas and scattered islands, and partly as a result of the government's persistent underinvestment in the nation's infrastructure.  In recent years, however, the Philippine government has been pushing to improve the transportation system in the country through various infrastructure projects.  Jeepneys are the most popular mode of public transportation in the Philippines, they have also become a ubiquitous symbol of the Philippine culture.Another popular mode of public transportation in the country is the motorized tricycle; they are especially common in rural areas. 

Armed Forces of the Philippines<====>23448<====>Armed Forces of the Philippines  The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP)   are the military forces of the Philippines, composed of the Philippine Army, Philippine Navy (including the Philippine Marine Corps) and Philippine Air Force.  Previous attached branch was the defunct Philippine Constabulary, while the Philippine Coast Guard is a war time attached service.  Military service is entirely voluntary.   In 2012, the AFP Chief of Staff said that there had been no increase in the number of soldiers over a long period, and that the military aimed to hire 30,000 troops in three years.

Geography of Puerto Rico<====>23461<====>Geography of Puerto Rico  The geography of Puerto Rico consists of an archipelago located between the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, east of the Dominican Republic and west of the Virgin Islands.  The main island of Puerto Rico is the smallest and most eastern of the Greater Antilles.  With an area of  , it is the third largest island in the United States and the 82nd largest island in the world.  Various smaller islands and cays, including Vieques, Culebra, Mona, Desecheo, and Caja de Muertos comprise the remainder of the archipelago with only Culebra and Vieques being inhabited year-round. 

Demographics of Puerto Rico<====>23462<====>Demographics of Puerto Rico The population of Puerto Rico has been shaped by Amerindian settlement, European colonization especially under the Spanish Empire, slavery and economic migration.   This article is about the demographic features of the population of Puerto Rico, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population. History of migration Sometime between 400 B. C.  and 100 A. D. , the Arawak group of Amerindians inhabited Puerto Rico.  Around 600 A. D. , the Arawak no longer lived on the island, perhaps because they had integrated with another culture, or perhaps because they had been killed by illness. 

Politics of Puerto Rico<====>23463<====>Politics of Puerto Rico The politics of Puerto Rico take place in the framework of a republican democratic form of government that is under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United States as an organized unincorporated territory. As a republican form of government, the government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is divided into three branches: executive, legislative and judicial, as established by the Constitution of Puerto Rico.  The executive power is exercised by the executive branch, which is headed by the Governor, advised by a cabinet of secretaries that are independent of the legislature.  Legislative power is vested upon the Legislature. 

Telecommunications in Puerto Rico<====>23465<====>Telecommunications in Puerto RicoTelecommunications in Puerto Rico includes radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet. Broadcasting in Puerto Rico is regulated by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  Radio Stations: 140 radio stations (as of January 2015).  FM Query - FM Radio Technical Information - Audio Division (FCC) USA   AM Query - AM Radio Technical Information - Audio Division (FCC) USA  Television Stations: more than 30 TV stations operating; three stations of the US Armed Forces Radio and Television Service; cable TV subscription services are available (2007).   Television sets: 1. 0 million sets (1997). 

Transportation in Puerto Rico<====>23466<====>Transportation in Puerto Rico  Transportation in Puerto Rico includes a system of roads, highways, freeways, airports, ports and harbors, and railway systems, serving a population of approximately 4 million inhabitants year-round.  It is funded primarily with both local and federal government funds. Airports Puerto Rico has a total of 30 airports (3 of which are international), including one in each of the smaller islands of Vieques and Culebra.  The main airport is Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, and consists of two runways and three concourses.  It is by far the busiest airport in Puerto Rico, with direct connections to most major cities in the mainland United States, Latin America, Canada the Caribbean, and Madrid, Spain. 

Military of Puerto Rico<====>23467<====>Military of Puerto RicoThe military defense of Puerto Rico is the responsibility of the United States as part of the Treaty of Paris.  Locally, Puerto Rico has its own National Guard, the Puerto Rico National Guard, and its own state defense force, the Puerto Rico State Guard, which, by local law, is under the authority of the Puerto Rico National Guard.  The commander-in-chief of both forces is the governor of Puerto Rico, currently Ricky Rosselló, who delegates his authority to the Puerto Rico Adjutant General, currently Brigadier General Isabelo Rivera The Adjutant General, in turn, delegates the authority over the State Guard to another officer but retains the authority over the Puerto Rico National Guard as a whole. 

Polyhedron<====>23470<====>Polyhedron  Examples of polyhedra Regular tetrahedron  Small stellated dodecahedron  Icosidodecahedron  Great cubicuboctahedron  Rhombic triacontahedron  A toroidal polyhedron In geometry, a polyhedron (plural polyhedra or polyhedrons) is a solid in three dimensions with flat polygonal faces, straight edges and sharp corners or vertices.  The word polyhedron comes from the Classical Greek πολύεδρον, as poly- (stem of πολύς, "many") + -hedron (form of ἕδρα, "base" or "seat"). A convex polyhedron is the convex hull of finitely many points, not all on the same plane. Cubes and pyramids are examples of convex polyhedra. A polyhedron is a 3-dimensional example of the more general polytope in any number of dimensions. 

Polytope<====>23471<====>Polytope In elementary geometry, a polytope is a geometric object with "flat" sides.  It is a generalisation in any number of dimensions of the three-dimensional polyhedron.  Polytopes may exist in any general number of dimensions n as an n-dimensional polytope or n-polytope.  Flat sides mean that the sides of a (k+1)-polytope consist of k-polytopes that may have (k-1)-polytopes in common.  For example, a two-dimensional polygon is a 2-polytope and a three-dimensional polyhedron is a 3-polytope. Some theories further generalize the idea to include such objects as unbounded apeirotopes and tessellations, decompositions or tilings of curved manifolds including spherical polyhedra, and set-theoretic abstract polytopes. 

Paper-and-pencil game<====>23472<====>Paper-and-pencil game Paper-and-pencil games are games that can be played solely with paper and pencil (or other writing implement), usually without erasing. In some board games, including some abstract strategy games like Gomoku, a piece once played will not be moved on the board or removed from the board.  Such games can be played either as board games or as paper-and-pencil games, while many other paper-and-pencil games cannot be played without writing utensils. The term is also used to distinguish role-playing games from role-playing video games, although role-playing games do not necessarily use either pencils or paper. Examples of paper-and-pencil games are Tic-tac-toe, Sprouts, and Dots and Boxes. 

Paleomap<====>23473<====>PaleomapPaleomaps are maps of continents and mountain ranges in the past based on plate reconstructions.   Until the 1960s, paleomaps were not very satisfactory, since it was difficult to understand many quite distinctive features.   For example, huge river deltas seemed to be associated with what must have been rather small drainage basins.   With the discovery of plate tectonics, it became apparent that land masses move relative to one another over time.   Ancient geologic features started to make far more sense.   It is now possible to construct maps that are probably fairly accurate for continental positions over several hundred million years. 

Problem of universals<====>23474<====>Problem of universalsIn metaphysics, the problem of universals refers to the question of whether properties exist, and if so, what they are.Properties are qualities or relations that two or more entities have in common.  The various kinds of properties, such as qualities and relations, are referred to as universals.  For instance, one can imagine three cup holders on a table that have in common the quality of being circular or exemplifying circularity,  or two daughters that have in common being the female offsprings of Frank.  There are many such properties, such as being human, red, male or female, liquid, big or small, taller than, father of, etc. 

Plea bargain<====>23476<====>Plea bargainThe plea bargain (also plea agreement, plea deal, copping a plea, or plea in mitigation) is any agreement in a criminal case between the prosecutor  and defendant whereby the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a particular charge in return for some concession from the prosecutor.  This may mean that the defendant will plead guilty to a less serious charge, or to one of the several charges, in return for the dismissal of other charges; or it may mean that the defendant will plead guilty to the original criminal charge in return for a more lenient sentence. 

Protest song<====>23477<====>Protest song A protest song is a song that is associated with a movement for social change and hence part of the broader category of topical songs (or songs connected to current events).  It may be folk, classical, or commercial in genre. Among social movements that have an associated body of songs are the abolition movement, women's suffrage, the labor movement, the human rights movement, civil rights, the anti-war movement and 1960s counterculture, the feminist movement, the sexual revolution, the gay rights movement, animal rights movement, vegetarianism and veganism, gun control, and environmentalism. Protest songs are often situational, having been associated with a social movement through context. 

Professor Griff<====>23478<====>Professor Griff    Richard Griffin (born August 1, 1960), better known by his stage name Professor Griff, is an American rapper, spoken word artist, and lecturer.  He is a member of the hip hop group Public Enemy and head of the group Security of the First World.  He married rapper Sole' (Tonya Johnston) in 2017.  She was married to Ginuwine previously and has two girls with him. Controversy and departure from Public EnemyBefore the release of It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, Professor Griff, in his role as Minister of Information, gave interviews to UK magazines on behalf of Public Enemy, during which he made homophobic and anti-Semitic remarks. 

Physicalism<====>23479<====>PhysicalismIn philosophy, physicalism is the ontological thesis that "everything is physical", that there is "nothing over and above" the physical,  or that everything supervenes on the physical.   Physicalism is a form of ontological monism—a "one substance" view of the nature of reality as opposed to a "two-substance" (dualism) or "many-substance" (pluralism) view.  Both the definition of "physical" and the meaning of physicalism have been debated. Physicalism is closely related to materialism.  Physicalism grew out of materialism with the success of the physical sciences in explaining observed phenomena.  The terms are often used interchangeably, although they are sometimes distinguished, for example on the basis of physics describing more than just matter (including energy and physical law). 

Philosophy of perception<====>23483<====>Philosophy of perceptionThe philosophy of perception is concerned with the nature of perceptual experience and the status of perceptual data, in particular how they relate to beliefs about, or knowledge of, the world.  cf.    BonJour, Laurence (2007): "Epistemological Problems of Perception. " Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, accessed 1. 9. 2010.   Any explicit account of perception requires a commitment to one of a variety of ontological or metaphysical views.  Philosophers distinguish internalist accounts, which assume that perceptions of objects, and knowledge or beliefs about them, are aspects of an individual's mind, and externalist accounts, which state that they constitute real aspects of the world external to the individual. 

Proper name (philosophy)<====>23484<====>Proper name (philosophy)In the philosophy of language a proper name, for example the names of persons or places, is a name which is ordinarily taken to uniquely identify its referent in the world.  As such it presents particular challenges for theories of meaning and it has become a central problem in analytical philosophy.   The common sense view was originally formulated by John Stuart Mill in A System of Logic where he defines it as "a word that answers the purpose of showing what thing it is that we are talking about but not of telling anything about it". 

Prolog<====>23485<====>Prolog  Prolog is a general-purpose logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics.Prolog has its roots in first-order logic, a formal logic, and unlike many other programming languages, Prolog is intended primarily as a declarative programming language: the program logic is expressed in terms of relations, represented as facts and rules.   A computation is initiated by running a query over these relations.  The language was first conceived by a group around Alain Colmerauer in Marseille, France, in the early 1970s and the first Prolog system was developed in 1972 by Colmerauer with Philippe Roussel. 

Phil Zimmermann<====>23486<====>Phil Zimmermann  Philip R.  "Phil" Zimmermann, Jr.  (born February 12, 1954) is the creator of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), the most widely used email encryption software in the world.   He is also known for his work in VoIP encryption protocols, notably ZRTP and Zfone.  Zimmermann is co-founder and Chief Scientist of the global encrypted communications firm, Silent Circle. BackgroundHe was born in Camden, New Jersey.  His father was a concrete mixer truck driver.  Zimmermann received a B. S.  degree in computer science from Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida in 1978, and thereafter moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. 

Political spectrum<====>23490<====>Political spectrum  A political spectrum is a system of classifying different political positions upon one or more geometric axes that symbolize independent political dimensions.  Most long-standing spectra include a right wing and left wing, which originally  referred to seating arrangements in the French parliament after the Revolution (1789–1799). According to the simplest left–right axis, communism and socialism are usually regarded internationally as being on the left, whereas conservatism and capitalism are on the right.  Liberalism can mean different things in different contexts, sometimes on the left (social liberalism), sometimes within libertarianism (classical liberalism). 

Pregnancy (mammals)<====>23496<====>Pregnancy (mammals)   In mammals, pregnancy is the period of reproduction during which a female carries one or more live offspring from implantation in the uterus through gestation.   It begins when a fertilized zygote implants in the female's uterus, and ends once it leaves the uterus. Fertilization and implantationDuring copulation, the male inseminates the female.  The spermatozoon fertilizes an ovum or various ova in the uterus or fallopian tubes, and this results in one or multiple zygotes.  Sometimes, a zygote can be created by humans outside of the animal's body in the artificial process of in-vitro fertilization. 

Paroxysmal attack<====>23497<====>Paroxysmal attack   Paroxysmal attacks or paroxysms (from Greek παροξυσμός) are a sudden recurrence or intensification of symptoms, such as a spasm or seizure.   These short, frequent, symptoms can be observed in various clinical conditions.  They are usually associated with multiple sclerosis or pertussis, but they may also be observed in other disorders such as encephalitis, head trauma, stroke, asthma, trigeminal neuralgia, breath-holding spells, epilepsy, malaria, tabes dorsalis, and Behçet's disease, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).  It has also been noted as a symptom of gratification disorder in children. The word   means "sudden attack, outburst",  and comes from the Greek παροξυσμός (paroxusmos), "irritation, exasperation". 

Potato<====>23501<====>Potato    The potato is a starchy, tuberous crop from the perennial nightshade Solanum tuberosum.  The word "potato" may refer either to the plant itself or to the edible tuber.   In the Andes, where the species is indigenous, some other closely related species are cultivated.  Potatoes were introduced to Europe in the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish. Potato has become a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world's food supply.  It is the world's fourth-largest food crop, following maize, wheat, and rice. 

Portland, Oregon<====>23503<====>Portland, Oregon   Portland ( ) is the largest city in the U. S.  state of Oregon and the seat of Multnomah County.  It is a major port in the Willamette Valley region of the Pacific Northwest, at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers.  The city covers   and had an estimated population of 639,863 in 2016,  making it the 26th most populous city in the United States, and the second-most populous in the Pacific Northwest.   Approximately 2,424,955 people live in the Portland metropolitan statistical area (MSA), making it the 25th most populous MSA in the United States. 

Pan and scan<====>23506<====>Pan and scan Pan and scan is a method of adjusting widescreen film images so that they can be shown within the proportions of a standard definition 4:3 aspect ratio television screen, often cropping off the sides of the original widescreen image to focus on the composition's most important aspects. Some film directors and enthusiasts disapprove of pan and scan cropping, because it can remove up to 45% of the original image on 2. 35:1 films or up to 53% on earlier 2. 55:1 presentations, changing the director or cinematographer's original vision and intentions.  The most extreme examples remove up to 75% of the original picture on such aspect ratios as 2. 

Plymouth<====>23508<====>PlymouthPlymouth  ( ) is a city on the south coast of Devon, England, about   south-west of Exeter and   west-south-west of London.  It lies between the mouths of the rivers Plym to the east and Tamar to the west, where they join Plymouth Sound to form the boundary with Cornwall. Plymouth's early history extends to the Bronze Age, when a first settlement emerged at Mount Batten.  This settlement continued as a trading post for the Roman Empire, until it was surpassed by the more prosperous village of Sutton founded in the ninth century, now called Plymouth. 

Point-to-Point Protocol<====>23511<====>Point-to-Point Protocol  In computer networking, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a data link layer (layer 2) communications protocol used to establish a direct connection between two nodes.  It connects two routers directly without any host or any other networking device in between.  It can provide connection authentication, transmission encryption,  and compression. PPP is used over many types of physical networks including serial cable, phone line, trunk line, cellular telephone, specialized radio links, and fiber optic links such as SONET.  Internet service providers (ISPs) have used PPP for customer dial-up access to the Internet, since IP packets cannot be transmitted over a modem line on their own, without some data link protocol. 

Patterson–Gimlin film<====>23512<====>Patterson–Gimlin film  The Patterson–Gimlin film (also known as the Patterson film or the PGF) is an American short motion picture of an unidentified subject which the filmmakers have said was a Bigfoot.  The footage was shot in 1967 in Northern California, and has since been subjected to many attempts to authenticate or debunk it. The footage was filmed  alongside Bluff Creek, a tributary of the Klamath River, about 25 logging-road miles northwest of Orleans, California, in Humboldt County.  The film site is roughly 38 miles south of Oregon and 18 miles east of the Pacific Ocean.

Paul Valéry<====>23519<====>Paul Valéry Ambroise Paul Toussaint Jules Valéry ( ;   ; 30 October 1871 – 20 July 1945) was a French poet, essayist, and philosopher.   In addition to his poetry and fiction (drama and dialogues), his interests included aphorisms on art, history, letters, music, and current events.  Valéry was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 12 different years.  BiographyValéry was born to a Corsican father and Genoese-Istrian mother in Sète, a town on the Mediterranean coast of the Hérault, but he was raised in Montpellier, a larger urban center close by.  After a traditional Roman Catholic education, he studied law at university and then resided in Paris for most of the remainder of his life, where he was, for a while, part of the circle of Stéphane Mallarmé. 

Pianist<====>23528<====>Pianist A pianist (   ,    ) is an individual musician who plays the piano.  Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano.  Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music.  Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard.  Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: "In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children" Pianists past and presentModern classical pianists dedicate their careers to performing, recording, teaching, researching as well as learning new works/expanding their repertoire. 

Proverb<====>23529<====>Proverb A proverb (from  ) is a simple and concrete saying, popularly known and repeated, that expresses a truth based on common sense or experience.  They are often metaphorical.  Proverbs fall into the category of formulaic language. Proverbs are often borrowed from similar languages and cultures, and sometimes come down to the present through more than one language.  Both the Bible (including, but not limited to the Book of Proverbs) and medieval Latin (aided by the work of Erasmus) have played a considerable role in distributing proverbs across Europe.  Mieder has concluded that cultures that treat the Bible as their "major spiritual book contain between three hundred and five hundred proverbs that stem from the Bible". 

Portability (social security)<====>23531<====>Portability (social security)The portability of social security benefits is the ability of workers to preserve, maintain, and transfer acquired social security rights and social security rights in the process of being acquired  from one private, occupational, or public social security scheme to another.   Social security rights refer to rights stemming from pension schemes (old age, survivor, disability), unemployment insurance, health insurance, workers' compensation, and sickness benefits.  Hence, if social security benefits are portable, contributors to, for example, old-age pension schemes do not experience any disadvantage such as the loss of contributions and benefits associated with these contributions when moving from one job to another, from one occupation to another, or from the public to the private sector or vice versa. 

Percopsiformes<====>23534<====>Percopsiformes The Percopsiformes are a small order of ray-finned fishes, comprising the trout-perch and its allies. It contains just ten extant species, grouped into seven genera and three families. Five of these genera are monotypic They are generally small fish, ranging from   in adult body length. They inhabit freshwater habitats in North America. They are grouped together because of technical  characteristics of their internal anatomy, and the different species may appear quite different externally.

Photon<====>23535<====>Photon  A photon is a type of elementary particle, the quantum of the electromagnetic field including electromagnetic radiation such as light, and the force carrier for the electromagnetic force (even when static via virtual particles).  The photon has zero rest mass and always moves at the speed of light within a vacuum. Like all elementary particles, photons are currently best explained by quantum mechanics and exhibit wave–particle duality, exhibiting properties of both waves and  .  For example, a single photon may be refracted by a lens and exhibit wave interference with itself, and it can behave as a particle with definite and finite measurable position or momentum, though not both at the same time. 

Philipp Franz von Siebold<====>23537<====>Philipp Franz von Siebold Philipp Franz Balthasar von Siebold (17 February 1796 – 18 October 1866) was a German physician, botanist, and traveler.  He achieved prominence by his studies of Japanese flora and fauna and the introduction of Western medicine in Japan.  He was the father of the first female Japanese doctor, Kusumoto Ine. CareerEarly lifeBorn into a family of doctors and professors of medicine in Würzburg (then in the Bishopric of Würzburg, later part of Bavaria), Siebold initially studied medicine at University of Würzburg from November 1815,    where he became a member of the Corps Moenania Würzburg. 

Probability interpretations<====>23538<====>Probability interpretations The word probability has been used in a variety of ways since it was first applied to the mathematical study of games of chance .   Does probability measure the real, physical tendency of something to occur or is it a measure of how strongly one believes it will occur, or does it draw on both these elements?  In answering such questions, mathematicians interpret the probability values of probability theory. There are two broad categories    The taxonomy of probability interpretations given here is similar to that ofthe longer and more complete Interpretations of Probability article in the online Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 

Probability axioms<====>23539<====>Probability axioms In Kolmogorov's probability theory, the probability P of some event E, denoted  P(E) , is usually defined such that P satisfies the Kolmogorov axioms, named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov, which are described below. These assumptions can be summarised as follows: Let (Ω, F, P) be a measure space with  P(Ω) = 1.  Then (Ω, F, P) is a probability space, with sample space Ω, event space F and probability measure P. An alternative approach to formalising probability, favoured by some Bayesians, is given by Cox's theorem. AxiomsFirst axiomThe probability of an event is a non-negative real number: P(E)\in\mathbb{R}, P(E)\geq 0 \qquad \forall E \in F where  F  is the event space. 

Probability theory<====>23542<====>Probability theory Probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with probability.  Although there are several different probability interpretations, probability theory treats the concept in a rigorous mathematical manner by expressing it through a set of axioms.  Typically these axioms formalise probability in terms of a probability space, which assigns a measure taking values between 0 and 1, termed the probability measure, to a set of outcomes called the sample space.  Any specified subset of these outcomes is called an event. Central subjects in probability theory include discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions, and stochastic processes, which provide mathematical abstractions of non-deterministic or uncertain processes or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in a random fashion. 

Probability distribution<====>23543<====>Probability distribution  In probability theory and statistics, a probability distribution is a mathematical function that, stated in simple terms, can be thought of as providing the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes in an experiment.  For instance, if the random variable   is used to denote the outcome of a coin toss ("the experiment"), then the probability distribution of   would take the value 0. 5 for  , and 0. 5 for   (assuming the coin is fair). In more technical terms, the probability distribution is a description of a random phenomenon in terms of the probabilities of events. 

Psychological statistics<====>23545<====>Psychological statistics  Psychological statistics is application of formulas, theorems, numbers and laws to psychology.  Statistical Methods for psychology include development and application statistical theory and methods for modeling psychological data.  These methods include psychometrics, Factor analysis, Experimental Designs, Multivariate Behavioral Research.  The article also discusses journals in the same field Wilcox, R.  (2012).  Psychometrics Psychometrics deals with measurement of psychological attributes.  It involved developing and applying statistical models for mental measurements (Lord and Novik, ; etc. ) The measurement theories are divided into two major areas: (1) Classical test theory; (2) Item Response Theory  (Nunnally, J. 

Peter Cook<====>23547<====>Peter Cook    Peter Edward Cook (17 November 1937 – 9 January 1995) was an English actor, satirist, writer and comedian.  Cook is widely regarded as the leading light of the British satire boom of the 1960s.  He was closely associated with the anti-establishment comedy that emerged in the United Kingdom and United States in the late 1950s. Called "the father of modern satire" by The Guardian, in 2005, Cook was ranked number one in the Comedians' Comedian, a poll of over 300 comics, comedy writers, producers, and directors throughout the English-speaking world.   Early lifeCook was born at his parents' house, "Shearbridge", in Middle Warberry Road, Torquay, Devon. 

Psychedelic rock<====>23549<====>Psychedelic rock    Psychedelic rock is a diverse style of rock music inspired, influenced, or representative of psychedelic culture, which is centred around perception-altering hallucinogenic drugs.  Psychedelic rock is intended to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD.  Many psychedelic groups differ in style, and the label is often used indiscriminately.  Originating in the mid-1960s among British and American musicians, the sounds of psychedelic rock invokes three core effects of LSD: depersonalization, dechronicization, and dynamization; all of which detach the user from reality.   Musically, the effects may be represented via novelty studio tricks, electronic or non-Western instrumentation, disjunctive song structures, and extended instrumental segments. 

Philips<====>23550<====>Philips   Koninklijke Philips N. V.  (Philips, stylized as PHILIPS) is a Dutch technology company headquartered in Amsterdam currently focused in the area of healthcare.  It was founded in Eindhoven in 1891, by Gerard Philips and his father Frederik.  It was once one of the largest electronic conglomerates in the world and  currently employs around 105,000 people across more than 60 countries.  Philips is organized into three main divisions: Philips Consumer Lifestyle (formerly Philips Consumer Electronics and Philips Domestic Appliances and Personal Care), Philips Healthcare (formerly Philips Medical Systems) and Philips Lighting.   , Philips was the largest manufacturer of lighting in the world measured by applicable revenues. 

Perciformes<====>23551<====>Perciformes  Perciformes, also called the Percomorpha or Acanthopteri, are the most numerous order of vertebrates, containing about 41% of all bony fish .   Perciformes means "perch-like".  They belong to the class of ray-finned fish, and comprise over 10,000 species found in almost all aquatic ecosystems. The order contains about 160 families, which is the most of any order within the vertebrates.It is also the most variably sized order of vertebrates, ranging from the 7-mm (1/4-in) Schindleria brevipinguis to the 5-m (16. 4 ft) marlin in the Makaira genus.  They first appeared and diversified in the Late Cretaceous. 

Asimina<====>23553<====>Asimina   Asimina is a genus of small trees or shrubs described as a genus in 1763.   Asimina has large simple leaves and large fruit.  It is native to eastern North America and collectively referred to as pawpaw.  The genus includes the widespread common pawpaw Asimina triloba, which bears the largest edible fruit indigenous to the continent.   Pawpaws are native to 26 states of the U. S.  and to Ontario in Canada.   The common pawpaw is a patch-forming (clonal) understory tree found in well-drained, deep, fertile bottomland and hilly upland habitat. 

Pentecostalism<====>23555<====>Pentecostalism   Pentecostalism or Classical Pentecostalism is a renewal movement "Spirit and Power: A 10-Country Survey of Pentecostals", Executive Summary.  The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life.   within Protestant  Christianity that places special emphasis on a direct personal experience of God through the baptism with the Holy Spirit.  The term Pentecostal is derived from Pentecost, the Greek name for the Jewish Feast of Weeks.  For Christians, this event commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the followers of Jesus Christ, as described in the second chapter of the Book of Acts. 

Pangenesis<====>23558<====>Pangenesis Pangenesis was Charles Darwin's hypothetical mechanism for heredity.   He presented this 'provisional hypothesis' in his 1868 work The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication and felt that it brought 'together a multitude of facts which are at present left disconnected by any efficient cause'.  The etymology of the word comes from the Greek words pan (a prefix meaning "whole", "encompassing") and genesis ("birth") or genos ("origin").  The hypothesis was eventually replaced by Mendel's laws of inheritance. The pangenesis theory, similar to Hippocrates's views on the topic, imply that the whole of parental organisms participate in heredity (thus the prefix pan) while adapting to cell theory. 

Proboscidea<====>23560<====>Proboscidea   The Proboscidea (from the Greek   and the Latin proboscis) are a taxonomic order of afrotherian mammals containing one living family, Elephantidae, and several extinct families.  This order, first described by J.  Illiger in 1811, encompasses the trunked mammals.   In addition to their enormous size, later proboscideans are distinguished by tusks and long, muscular trunks; these features were less developed or absent in the smaller early proboscideans.  Beginning in the mid Miocene, most members of this order were very large animals.  The largest land mammal of all time may have been a proboscidean; Palaeoloxodon namadicus, which may have weighed up to  , with a shoulder height of up to  , surpassing several sauropod dinosaurs (in height). 

Paranthropus<====>23561<====>Paranthropus  Paranthropus (from Greek παρα, para "beside"; άνθρωπος, ánthropos "human") is a genus of extinct hominins.  Also known as robust australopithecines, they were bipedal hominids that probably descended from the gracile australopithecine hominids (Australopithecus) 2. 7 million years ago.Members of this genus are characterised by robust craniodental anatomy, including gorilla-like sagittal cranial crests, which suggest strong muscles of mastication, and broad, grinding herbivorous teeth.  However, Paranthropus skulls lack the transverse cranial crests that are also present in modern gorillas. Discovery A partial cranium and mandible of Paranthropus robustus was discovered in 1938 by a schoolboy, Gert Terblanche, at Kromdraai B (70 km south west of Pretoria) in South Africa. 

Odd-toed ungulate<====>23562<====>Odd-toed ungulate  Members of the order Perissodactyla, otherwise known as odd-toed ungulates, are mammals characterized by an odd number of toes and by hindgut fermentation with somewhat simple stomachs.  Perissodactyla comes from the Ancient Greek περισσός (perissós, “uneven”) + δάκτυλος (dáktulos, “a finger, toe”).  Unlike the even-toed ungulates, they digest plant cellulose in their intestines rather than in one or more stomach chambers.  The order includes three extant families: Equidae (horses, asses, and zebras), Rhinocerotidae (rhinoceroses), and Tapiridae (tapirs), with a total of about 17 species.  Despite their very different appearances, they were recognized as related families in the 19th century by the zoologist Richard Owen, who also coined the order name. 

Pai gow<====>23565<====>Pai gow  Pai gow ( ) is a Chinese gambling game, played with a set of 32 Chinese dominoes.  It is played in major casinos in China (including Macau); the United States (including Las Vegas, Nevada; Reno, Nevada; Connecticut; Atlantic City, New Jersey; Pennsylvania; and cardrooms in California); Canada (including Edmonton, Alberta and Calgary, Alberta); Australia; and, New Zealand. The name "pai gow" is sometimes used to refer to a card game called pai gow poker (or “double-hand poker”), which is loosely based on pai gow. RulesStartingTiles are shuffled on the table and are arranged into eight face-down stacks of four tiles each in an assembly known as the woodpile. 

Partially ordered set<====>23572<====>Partially ordered setIn mathematics, especially order theory, a partially ordered set (also poset) formalizes and generalizes the intuitive concept of an ordering, sequencing, or arrangement of the elements of a set.  A poset consists of a set together with a binary relation indicating that, for certain pairs of elements in the set, one of the elements precedes the other in the ordering.  The word "partial" in the names "partial order" or "partially ordered set" is used as an indication that not every pair of elements need be comparable.  That is, there may be pairs of elements for which neither element precedes the other in the poset. 

Parmenides<====>23575<====>Parmenides  Parmenides of Elea ( ;  ; fl.  late sixth or early fifth century BC) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher from Elea in Magna Graecia (Greater Greece, included Southern Italy).  He was the founder of the Eleatic school of philosophy.  The single known work of Parmenides is a poem, On Nature, which has survived only in fragmentary form.  In this poem, Parmenides describes two views of reality.  In "the way of truth" (a part of the poem), he explains how reality (coined as "what-is") is one, change is impossible, and existence is timeless, uniform, necessary, and unchanging. 

Tetraodontidae<====>23576<====>Tetraodontidae   The Tetraodontidae are a  family of primarily marine and estuarine fish of the order Tetraodontiformes.  The family includes many familiar species which are variously called pufferfish, puffers, balloonfish, blowfish, blowies, bubblefish, globefish, swellfish, toadfish, toadies, honey toads, sugar toads, and sea squab.They are morphologically similar to the closely related porcupinefish, which have large external spines (unlike the thinner, hidden spines of the Tetraodontidae, which are only visible when the fish has puffed up).  The scientific name refers to the four large teeth, fused into an upper and lower plate, which are used for crushing the shells of crustaceans and mollusks, their natural prey. 

Partial function<====>23577<====>Partial function In mathematics, a partial function from X to Y (written as   or  ) is a function  , for some subset X ′ of X.  It generalizes the concept of a function   by not forcing f to map every element of X to an element of Y (only some subset X ′ of X).  If  , then f is called a total function and is equivalent to a function.  Partial functions are often used when the exact domain, X, is not known (e. g.  many functions in computability theory ). 

Photoelectric effect<====>23579<====>Photoelectric effect The photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons or other free carriers when light shines on a material.  Electrons emitted in this manner can be called photo electrons.  This phenomenon is commonly studied in electronic physics, as well as in fields of chemistry, such as quantum chemistry or electrochemistry. According to classical electromagnetic theory, this effect can be attributed to the transfer of energy from the light to an electron.  From this perspective, an alteration in the intensity of light would induce changes in the kinetic energy of the electrons emitted from the metal.  Furthermore, according to this theory, a sufficiently dim light would be expected to show a time lag between the initial shining of its light and the subsequent emission of an electron. 

Paleogene<====>23580<====>Paleogene   The Paleogene (  or  ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period   million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period   Mya.  It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon.   The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. 

Preorder<====>23582<====>Preorder  In mathematics, especially in order theory, a preorder or quasiorder is a binary relation that is reflexive and transitive.  Preorders are more general than equivalence relations and (non-strict) partial orders, both of which are special cases of a preorder. The name 'preorder' comes from the idea that preorders (that are not partial orders) are 'almost' (partial) orders, but not quite; they're neither necessarily anti-symmetric nor symmetric.   Because a preorder is a binary relation, the symbol ≤ can be used as the notational device for the relation.   However, because they are not necessarily anti-symmetric, some of the ordinary intuition associated to the symbol ≤ may not apply. 

Psychoanalysis<====>23585<====>Psychoanalysis  Psychoanalysis is a set of theories and therapeutic techniques  related to the study of the unconscious mind,  which together form a method of treatment for mental-health disorders.  The discipline was established in the early 1890s by Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud and stemmed partly from the clinical work of Josef Breuer and others. Freud first used the term psychoanalysis (in French) in 1896.  Die Traumdeutung (The Interpretation of Dreams), which Freud saw as his "most significant work", appeared in November 1899.   Psychoanalysis was later developed in different directions, mostly by students of Freud such as Alfred Adler and Carl Gustav Jung,  and by neo-Freudians such as Erich Fromm, Karen Horney and Harry Stack Sullivan. 

Pinyin<====>23588<====>PinyinHanyu Pinyin ( ), often abbreviated to pinyin, is the official romanization system for Standard Chinese in mainland China and to some extent in Taiwan.  It is often used to teach Standard Chinese, which is normally written using Chinese characters.  The system includes four diacritics denoting tones.  Pinyin without tone marks is used to spell Chinese names and words in languages written with the Latin alphabet, and also in certain computer input methods to enter Chinese characters. The pinyin system was developed in the 1950s by many linguists, including Zhou Youguang,    based on earlier forms of romanization of Chinese. 

Parable of the Pearl<====>23589<====>Parable of the PearlThe Parable of the Pearl (also called the Pearl of Great Price) is one of the parables of Jesus.  It appears in   and illustrates the great value of the Kingdom of Heaven.  It is the penultimate parable in Matthew 13, just before the Parable of the Dragnet. It immediately follows the Parable of the Hidden Treasure, which has a similar theme.  It does not appear in the other synoptic gospels   but a version of this parable does appear in the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas, Saying 76.  Gospel of Thomas: Lamb translation and Patterson/Meyer translation. 

Pantheism<====>23590<====>Pantheism    Pantheism is the belief that all reality is identical with divinity,  or that everything composes an all-encompassing, immanent god.Pantheists do not believe in a distinct personal or anthropomorphic god  and hold a broad range of doctrines differing with regards to the forms of and relationships between divinity and reality.  Pantheism was popularized in Western culture as a theology and philosophy based on the work of the 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza,   particularly his book Ethics, published in 1677.  Genevieve Lloyd, Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Spinoza and The Ethics (Routledge Philosophy Guidebooks), Routledge; 1 edition (2 October 1996),  , Page: 24  The term "pantheism" was coined by Mathematician Joseph Raphson in 1697   and has since been used to describe the beliefs of a variety of people and organizations. 

Panentheism<====>23591<====>Panentheism  Panentheism (from the Ancient Greek expression πᾶν ἐν θεῷ, pān en theṓ, literally "all in God"  ) is the belief that the divine pervades and   every part of the universe and also extends beyond time and space.  The term was coined by the German philosopher Karl Krause in 1828 to distinguish the ideas of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775–1854) about the relation of God and the universe from the supposed pantheism of Baruch Spinoza.  John Culp (2013): “Panentheism”, in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.  Retrieved 18 March 2014. 

Paraphilia<====>23592<====>Paraphilia  Paraphilia (previously known as sexual perversion and sexual deviation)   is the experience of intense sexual arousal to atypical objects, situations, fantasies, behaviors, or individuals.Such attraction may be labeled sexual fetishism.  No consensus has been found for any precise border between unusual sexual interests and paraphilic ones.    There is debate over which, if any, of the paraphilias should be listed in diagnostic manuals, such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The number and taxonomy of paraphilia is under debate; one source lists as many as 549 types of paraphilia. 

Pediatrics<====>23593<====>Pediatrics   Pediatrics (also spelled paediatrics or pædiatrics) is the branch of medicine that involves the medical care of infants, children, and adolescents.  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends people be under pediatric care up to the age of 21.   A medical doctor who specializes in this area is known as a pediatrician, or paediatrician.  The word pediatrics and its cognates mean "healer of children"; they derive from two Greek words:   (pais "child") and   (iatros "doctor, healer").  Pediatricians work both in hospitals, particularly those working in its subspecialties such as neonatology, and as primary care physicians. 

Physiology<====>23597<====>PhysiologyPhysiology ( ;) is the scientific study of normal mechanisms, and their interactions, which works within a living system.A sub-discipline of biology, its focus is in how organisms, organ systems, organs, cells, and biomolecules carry out the chemical or physical functions that exist in a living system.Given the size of the field, it is divided into, among others, animal physiology (including that of humans), plant physiology, cellular physiology, microbial physiology (microbial metabolism), bacterial physiology, and viral physiology.  Central to an understanding of physiological functioning is its integrated nature with other disciplines such as chemistry and physics, coordinated homeostatic control mechanisms, and continuous communication between cells. 

Pi<====>23601<====>Pi    The number   ( ) is a mathematical constant.   Originally defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, it now has various equivalent definitions and appears in many formulas in all areas of mathematics and physics.   It is approximately equal to 3. 14159.  It has been represented by the Greek letter " " since the mid-18th century, though it is also sometimes spelled out as "pi". Being an irrational number,   cannot be expressed exactly as a common fraction (equivalently, its decimal representation never ends and never settles into a permanent repeating pattern). 

Postmodernism<====>23603<====>Postmodernism  Postmodernism describes a broad movement that developed in the mid- to late-20th century across philosophy, the arts, architecture, and criticism which marked a departure from modernism.While encompassing a broad range of ideas, postmodernism is typically defined by an attitude of skepticism, irony, or rejection toward grand narratives, ideologies, and various tenets of universalism, including objective notions of reason, human nature, social progress, moral universalism, absolute truth, and objective reality.Instead, postmodern thinkers may assert that claims to knowledge and truth are products of social, historical or political discourses or interpretations, and are therefore contextual or socially constructed. 

Photography<====>23604<====>Photography    Photography is the science, art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.  Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure.  With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. 

Postmodern philosophy<====>23612<====>Postmodern philosophy  Postmodern philosophy is a philosophical movement that arose in the second half of the 20 th  century as a critical response to certain foundational assumptions of Western philosophy, in particular the modernist philosophical ideas developed during the 18th-century Enlightenment. Postmodernist thinkers developed concepts like difference, repetition, the trace, and hyperreality to subvert "grand narratives," univocity of meaning, claims to epistemic certainty, and traditional philosophical concepts such as identity, nature, historical progress, objectivity, and subjectivity.Postmodern philosophy is not a complete departure from modern philosophy but a continuation of modernist thinking in a different mode. 

Postmodern music<====>23613<====>Postmodern music  Postmodern music is either simply music of the postmodern era, or music that follows aesthetical and philosophical trends of postmodernism.  As the name suggests, the postmodernist movement formed partly in reaction to modernism.  Even so, postmodern music still does not primarily define itself in opposition to modernist music; this label is applied instead by critics and theorists. Postmodern music is not a distinct musical style, but rather refers to music of the postmodern era.  The terms "postmodern", "postmodernism", "postmodernist", and "postmodernity" are exasperating terms  .  Indeed, postmodernists question the tight definitions and categories of academic disciplines, which they regard simply as the remnants of modernity  . 

Pump<====>23617<====>Pump A pump is a device that moves fluids (liquids or gases), or sometimes slurries, by mechanical action.  Pumps can be classified into three major groups according to the method they use to move the fluid: direct lift, displacement, and gravity pumps.  Pumps operate by some mechanism (typically reciprocating or rotary), and consume energy to perform mechanical work by moving the fluid.  Pumps operate via many energy sources, including manual operation, electricity, engines, or wind power, come in many sizes, from microscopic for use in medical applications to large industrial pumps. Mechanical pumps serve in a wide range of applications such as pumping water from wells, aquarium filtering, pond filtering and aeration, in the car industry for  water-cooling and fuel injection, in the energy industry for pumping oil and natural gas or for operating cooling towers. 

Pressure<====>23619<====>Pressure   Pressure (symbol: p or P) is the force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area over which that force is distributed.  Gauge pressure (also spelled gage pressure) The preferred spelling varies by country and even by industry.  Further, both spellings are often used within a particular industry or country.  Industries in British English-speaking countries typically use the "gauge" spelling.   is the pressure relative to the ambient pressure. Various units are used to express pressure.  Some of these derive from a unit of force divided by a unit of area; the SI unit of pressure, the pascal (Pa), for example, is one newton per square metre; similarly, the pound-force per square inch (psi) is the traditional unit of pressure in the imperial and US customary systems. 

Polygon<====>23621<====>Polygon In elementary geometry, a polygon ( ) is a plane figure that is bounded by a finite chain of straight line segments closing in a loop to form a closed polygonal chain or circuit.  These segments are called its  edges or sides, and the points where two edges meet are the polygon's vertices (singular: vertex) or corners.  The interior of the polygon is sometimes called its body.  An n-gon is a polygon with n sides; for example, a triangle is a 3-gon.  A polygon is a 2-dimensional example of the more general polytope in any number of dimensions. 

Player character<====>23622<====>Player character  A player character (also known as PC and playable character) is a fictional character in a role-playing or video game whose actions are directly controlled by a player of the game rather than the rules of the game.  The characters that are not controlled by a player are called non-player characters (NPCs).  The actions of non-player characters are typically handled by the game itself in video games, or according to rules followed by a gamemaster refereeing tabletop role-playing games.  The player character functions as a fictional, alternate body for the player controlling it. Video games typically have one player character for each person playing the game. 

Parish<====>23623<====>Parish A parish is a church territorial entity constituting a division within a diocese.  A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church.  Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount).  By extension the term parish refers not only to the territorial entity but to the people of its community or congregation as well as to church property within it.  In England this church property was technically in ownership of the parish priest ex-officio, vested in him on his institution to that parish. 

Procopius<====>23624<====>Procopius  Procopius of Caesarea (  Prokopios ho Kaisareus,  ;   500 –   554 AD) was a prominent late antique scholar from Palaestina Prima.   Accompanying the Roman general Belisarius in the wars of the Emperor Justinian, he became the principal Byzantine historian of the 6th century, writing the Wars (or Histories), the Buildings of Justinian and the now-celebrated (and infamous) Secret History.  He is commonly held to be the last major historian of the ancient Western world. LifeApart from his own writings, the main source for Procopius' life is an entry in the Suda, Suda pi. 

Property<====>23626<====>Property    Property, in the abstract, is what belongs to or with something, whether as an attribute or as a component of said thing.  In the context of this article, it is one or more components (rather than attributes), whether physical or incorporeal, of a person's estate; or so belonging to, as in being owned by, a person or jointly a group of people or a legal entity like a corporation or even a society.  (With that meaning, the word property is uncountable and so is not used with an indefinite article or as a plural. 

Police<====>23627<====>Police    A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by a state to enforce the law, protect property, and limit civil disorder.   Their powers include the legitimized use of force.  The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility.  Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing. 

PDP-10<====>23628<====>PDP-10 The PDP-10 is a mainframe computer family  manufactured by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) from 1966  into the 1980s.  Later models were marketed under the DECsystem-10 name, especially when the TOPS-10 operating system became widely used. The PDP-10 architecture is almost identical to the earlier PDP-6 architecture, sharing the same 36-bit word length and slightly extending the instruction set (but with improved hardware implementation).  Some aspects of the instruction set are unusual, most notably the "byte" instructions, which operated on bit fields of any size from 1 to 36 bits inclusive according to the general definition of a byte as a contiguous sequence of a fixed number of bits. 

DECSYSTEM-20<====>23629<====>DECSYSTEM-20The DECSYSTEM-20 was a 36-bit Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 mainframe computer running the TOPS-20 operating system (products introduced in 1977).PDP-10 computers running the TOPS-10 operating system were labeled DECsystem-10 as a way of differentiating them from the PDP-11. Later on, those systems running TOPS-20 (on the KL10 PDP-10 processors) were labeled DECSYSTEM-20 (the block capitals being the result of a lawsuit brought against DEC by Singer, which once made a computer called "system-10"). The DECSYSTEM-20 was sometimes called PDP-20, although this designation was never used by DEC.The following models were produced:DECSYSTEM-2020: bit-slice processor with up to 512 kilowords of solid state RAM (The ADP OnSite version of the DECSYSTEM-2020 supported 1 MW of RAM)DECSYSTEM-2040: ECL processor with up to 1024 kilowords of magnetic core RAMDECSYSTEM-2050: ECL processor with 2k words of cache and up to 1024 kilowords of RAMDECSYSTEM-2060: ECL processor with 2k words of cache and up to 4096 kilowords of solid state memoryDECSYSTEM-2065: DECSYSTEM-2060 with MCA25 pager (double-sized (1024 entry) two-way associative hardware page table)The only significant difference the user could see between a DECsystem-10 and a DECSYSTEM-20 was the operating system and the color of the paint. Most (but not all) machines sold to run TOPS-10 were painted "Blasi Blue", System Paint, Digital Equipment Corporation, 1998  whereas most TOPS-20 machines were painted "Terracotta" (often mistakenly called "Chinese Red" or orange; the actual name of the color on the paint cans was Terracotta ).There were some significant internal differences between the earlier KL10 Model A processors, used in the earlier DECsystem-10s running on KL10 processors, and the later KL10 Model Bs, used for the DECSYSTEM-20s. Model As used the original PDP-10 memory bus, with external memory modules. The later Model B processors used in the DECSYSTEM-20 used internal memory, mounted in the same cabinet as the CPU. The Model As also had different packaging; they came in the original tall PDP-10 cabinets, rather than the short ones used later on for the DECSYSTEM-20.The last released implementation of DEC's 36-bit architecture was the single cabinet DECSYSTEM-2020, using a KS10 processor.The DECSYSTEM-20 was primarily designed and used as a small mainframe for timesharing. That is, multiple users would concurrently log on to individual user accounts and share use of the main processor to compile and run applications. Separate disk allocations were maintained for all users by the operating system, and various levels of protection could be maintained by for System, Owner, Group, and World users. A model 2060, for example, could typically host up to 40 to 60 simultaneous users before exhibiting noticeably reduced response time. Remaining machinesThe Living Computer Museum of Seattle, Washington maintains a 2065 running TOPS-10, which is available to interested parties via telnet upon registration (at no cost) at their website.References C.

Programmed Data Processor<====>23630<====>Programmed Data ProcessorProgrammed Data Processor (PDP), referred to by some customers, media and authors as "Programmable Data Processor,"The term PDP is an acroynm for Programmable Data Processor . . .  the series was introduced by their manufacturer, Digital Equipment Corporation . . . "  is a series of minicomputers made and marketed by the Digital Equipment Corporation from 1957 to 1990.The name "PDP" intentionally avoids the use of the term "computer" because, at the time of the first PDPs, computers had a reputation of being large, complicated, and expensive machines, and the venture capitalists behind Digital (especially Georges Doriot) would not support Digital's attempting to build a "computer"; the word "minicomputer" had not yet been coined. 

Primary mirror<====>23631<====>Primary mirrorA primary mirror (or primary) is the principal light-gathering surface (the objective) of a reflecting telescope. DescriptionThe primary mirror of a reflecting telescope is a spherical or parabolic shaped disks of polished reflective metal (speculum metal up to the mid 19th century), or in later telescopes, glass or other material coated with a reflective layer.  One of the first known reflecting telescopes, Newton's reflector of 1668, used a 3. 3 cm polished metal primary mirror.  The next major change was to use silver on glass rather than metal, in the 19th century such was with the Crossley reflector. 

Platonic idealism<====>23632<====>Platonic idealism   Platonic idealism usually refers to Plato's theory of forms or doctrine of ideas. OverviewSome commentators hold that Plato argued that truth is an abstraction.  In other words, we are urged to believe that Plato's theory of ideals is an abstraction, divorced from the so-called external world, of modern European philosophy, despite the fact Plato taught that ideals are ultimately real, and different from non-ideal things—indeed, he argued for a distinction between the ideal and non-ideal realm. These commentators speak thus: for example, a particular tree, with a branch or two missing, possibly alive, possibly dead, and with the initials of two lovers carved into its bark, is distinct from the abstract form of Tree-ness.

Protein<====>23634<====>Protein  Proteins (  or  ) are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues.  Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another.  Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity. A linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide. 

Physical chemistry<====>23635<====>Physical chemistry Physical chemistry is the study of macroscopic, atomic, subatomic, and particulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms of the principles, practices, and concepts of physics such as motion, energy, force, time, thermodynamics, quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, analytical dynamics and chemical equilibrium. Physical chemistry, in contrast to chemical physics, is predominantly (but not always) a macroscopic or supra-molecular science, as the majority of the principles on which it was founded relate to the bulk rather than the molecular/atomic structure alone (for example, chemical equilibrium and colloids). Some of the relationships that physical chemistry strives to resolve include the effects of:Intermolecular forces that act upon the physical properties of materials (plasticity, tensile strength, surface tension in liquids). 

Perimeter<====>23636<====>Perimeter A perimeter is a path that surrounds a two-dimensional shape.  The term may be used either for the path or its length—it can be thought of as the length of the outline of a shape.  The perimeter of a circle or ellipse is called its circumference. Calculating the perimeter has several practical applications.  A calculated perimeter is the length of fence required to surround a yard or garden.  The perimeter of a wheel (its circumference) describes how far it will roll in one revolution.  Similarly, the amount of string wound around a spool is related to the spool's perimeter. 

Phase (matter)<====>23637<====>Phase (matter) In the physical sciences, a phase is a region of space (a thermodynamic system), throughout which all physical properties of a material are essentially uniform. Examples of physical properties include density, index of refraction, magnetization and chemical composition.  A simple description is that a phase is a region of material that is chemically uniform, physically distinct, and (often) mechanically separable.  In a system consisting of ice and water in a glass jar, the ice cubes are one phase, the water is a second phase, and the humid air over the water is a third phase. 

Outline of physical science<====>23638<====>Outline of physical science   Physical science is a branch of natural science that studies non-living systems, in contrast to life science.  It in turn has many branches, each referred to as a "physical science", together called the "physical sciences".   However, the term "physical" creates an unintended, somewhat arbitrary distinction, since many branches of physical science also study biological phenomena and branches of chemistry such as organic chemistry.   DefinitionPhysical science can be described as all of the following:A branch of science  (a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe). 

Gasoline<====>23639<====>Gasoline    Gasoline or gas for short (American English), or petrol (British English), is a transparent, petroleum-derived liquid that is used primarily as a fuel in internal combustion engines.  It consists mostly of organic compounds obtained by the fractional distillation of petroleum, enhanced with a variety of additives.  On average, a 42-gallon barrel of crude oil (159 L) yields about   of gasoline when processed in an oil refinery, though this varies based on the crude oil source's assay. The characteristic of a particular gasoline blend to resist igniting too early (which causes knocking and reduces efficiency in reciprocating engines) is measured by its octane rating. 

Pentose<====>23640<====>PentoseA pentose is a monosaccharide with five carbon atoms.   Pentoses are organized into two groups: Aldopentoses have an aldehyde functional group at position 1.  Ketopentoses have a ketone functional group at position 2 or 3.  In the cell, pentoses have a higher metabolic stability than hexoses. Aldopentoses The aldopentoses have three chiral centers; therefore, eight (2 3 ) different stereoisomers are possible.    D -Arabinose    D -Lyxose    D -Ribose    D -Xylose    L -Arabinose    L -Lyxose    L -Ribose    L -Xylose Ribose is a constituent of RNA, and the related molecule, deoxyribose, is a constituent of DNA. 

Propane<====>23643<====>Propane  Propane ( ) is a three-carbon alkane with the molecular formula C 3 H 8 .  It is a gas at standard temperature and pressure, but compressible to a transportable liquid.  A by-product of natural gas processing and petroleum refining, it is commonly used as a fuel for barbecue grills.  Propane is one of a group of liquefied petroleum gases (LP gases).  The others include butane, propylene, butadiene, butylene, isobutylene, and mixtures thereof. HistoryPropane was discovered by the French chemist Marcellin Berthelot in 1857.   It was first identified as a volatile component in gasoline by Walter O. 

Precambrian<====>23645<====>Precambrian   The Precambrian (or Pre-Cambrian, sometimes abbreviated pЄ, or Cryptozoic) is the earliest part of Earth's history, set before the current Phanerozoic Eon.  The Precambrian is so named because it preceded the Cambrian, the first period of the Phanerozoic eon, which is named after Cambria, the Latinised name for Wales, where rocks from this age were first studied.  The Precambrian accounts for 88% of the Earth's geologic time. The Precambrian (colored green in the timeline figure) is a supereon that is subdivided into three eons (Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic) of the geologic time scale.  It spans from the formation of Earth about 4. 

Polymerase chain reaction<====>23647<====>Polymerase chain reaction  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique used in molecular biology to amplify a single copy or a few copies of a segment of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence.  Developed in 1983 by Kary Mullis,    Mullis, Kary B.  et al.  "Process for amplifying, detecting, and/or-cloning nucleic acid sequences"    who was an employee of the Cetus Corporation and also, the winner of Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993, it is an easy, cheap, and reliable way to repeatedly replicate a focused segment of DNA, a concept which is applicable to numerous fields in modern biology and related sciences. 

Polymerase<====>23648<====>PolymeraseA polymerase is an enzyme (EC 2. 7. 7. 6/7/19/48/49) that synthesizes long chains or polymers of nucleic acids.  DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase are used to assemble DNA and RNA molecules, respectively, by copying a DNA or RNA template strand using base-pairing interactions. A polymerase from the thermophilic bacterium, Thermus aquaticus (Taq) (PDB 1BGX, EC 2. 7. 7. 7) is used in the polymerase chain reaction, an important technique of molecular biology. Other well-known polymerases include:Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TDT), which lends diversity to antibody heavy chains.  Reverse Transcriptase, an enzyme used by RNA retroviruses like HIV, which is used to create a complementary strand to the preexisting strand of viral RNA before it can be integrated into the DNA of the host cell. 

Pacific Scandal<====>23649<====>Pacific Scandal The Pacific Scandal was a political scandal in Canada involving allegations of bribes being accepted by  150 members of the Conservative government in the attempts of private interests to influence the bidding for a national rail contract.    As part of British Columbia's 1871 agreement to join Canadian Confederation, the government had agreed to build a transcontinental railway linking the Pacific Province to the eastern provinces.    The proposed rail project, when completed, was the most intensive and ambitious of its kind ever undertaken to date.  However, as a new nation with limited capital resources, financing for the project was sought after both at home and abroad, naturally attracting interest from Great Britain and the United States. 

Primer (molecular biology)<====>23650<====>Primer (molecular biology)A primer is a short strand of RNA or DNA (generally about 18-22 bases) that serves as a starting point for DNA synthesis.  It is required for DNA replication because the enzymes that catalyze this process, DNA polymerases, can only add new nucleotides to an existing strand of DNA.  The polymerase starts replication at the 3'-end of the primer, and copies the opposite strand. In vivo DNA replication utilizes short strands of RNA called RNA primers to initiate DNA synthesis on both the leading and lagging strands — DNA primers are not seen in vivo in humans. 

Purine<====>23652<====>Purine A purine is a heterocyclic aromatic organic compound that consists of a pyrimidine ring fused to an imidazole ring.  Purine gives its name to the wider class of molecules, purines, which include substituted purines and their tautomers, are the most widely occurring nitrogen-containing heterocycle in nature.   Purine is water soluble. Purines are found in high concentration in meat and meat products, especially internal organs such as liver and kidney.  In general, plant-based diets are low in purines.   Examples of high-purine sources include: sweetbreads, anchovies, sardines, liver, beef kidneys, brains, meat extracts (e. g. 

Pyrimidine<====>23653<====>Pyrimidine  Pyrimidine is an aromatic heterocyclic organic compound similar to pyridine.One of the three diazines (six-membered heterocyclics with two nitrogen atoms in the ring), it has the nitrogen atoms at positions 1 and 3 in the ring. The other diazines are pyrazine (nitrogen atoms at the 1 and 4 positions) and pyridazine (nitrogen atoms at the 1 and 2 positions).  In nucleic acids, three types of nucleobases are pyrimidine derivatives: cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U). Occurrence and historyThe pyrimidine ring system has wide occurrence in nature   as substituted and ring fused compounds and derivatives, including the nucleotides, thiamine (vitamin B1) and alloxan. 

Play-by-mail game<====>23654<====>Play-by-mail game  Play-by-mail games, or play-by-post games, are games, of any type, played through postal mail or email. Correspondence chess has been played by mail for centuries.  The boardgame Diplomacy has been played by mail since the 1960s, starting with a printed newsletter (a fanzine) written by John Boardman.  More complex games, moderated entirely or partially by computer programs, were pioneered by Rick Loomis of Flying Buffalo in  1970.   The first such game offered via major e-mail services was WebWar II (based on Starweb and licensed from Flying Buffalo) from Neolithic Enterprises who accepted e-mail turns from all of the major e-mail services including CompuServe in 1983. 

Philip K. Dick Award<====>23658<====>Philip K.  Dick Award The Philip K.  Dick Award is a science fiction award given annually at Norwescon and sponsored by the Philadelphia Science Fiction Society and (since 2005) the Philip K.  Dick Trust.   Named after science fiction and fantasy writer Philip K.  Dick, it has been awarded since 1983, the year after his death.   It is awarded to the best original paperback published each year in the US.  The award was founded by Thomas Disch with assistance from David G.  Hartwell, Paul S.  Williams, and Charles N.  Brown. 

Plug-in (computing)<====>23659<====>Plug-in (computing) In computing, a plug-in (or plugin, add-in, addin, add-on, addon, or extension) is a software component that adds a specific feature to an existing computer program.  When a program supports plug-ins, it enables customization.  The common examples are the plug-ins used in web browsers to add new features such as search-engines, virus scanners, or the ability to use a new file type such as a new video format.  Well-known browser plug-ins include the Adobe Flash Player, the QuickTime Player, and the Java plug-in, which can launch a user-activated Java applet on a web page to its execution on a local Java virtual machine. 

Pierre Teilhard de Chardin<====>23660<====>Pierre Teilhard de Chardin  Pierre Teilhard de Chardin SJ (  ( ); 1 May 1881 – 10 April 1955) was a French idealist philosopher and Jesuit priest who trained as a paleontologist and geologist and took part in the discovery of Peking Man.  He conceived the vitalist idea of the Omega Point (a maximum level of complexity and consciousness towards which he believed the universe was evolving) and developed Vladimir Vernadsky's concept of noosphere. Although many of Teilhard's writings were censored by the Catholic Church during his lifetime because of his views on original sin, Teilhard has been posthumously praised by Pope Benedict XVI and other eminent Catholic figures, and his theological teachings were cited by Pope Francis in the 2015 encyclical, Laudato si'. 

Phutball<====>23661<====>Phutball Phutball (short for Philosopher's Football) is a two-player strategy board game described in Elwyn Berlekamp, John Horton Conway, and Richard K.  Guy's Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays. RulesPhutball is played on the intersections of a 19×15 grid using one white stone and as many black stones as needed.  In this article the two players are named Ohs (O) and Eks (X). The board is labeled A through P (omitting I) from left to right and 1 to 19 from bottom to top from Ohs' perspective.  Rows 0 and 20 represent "off the board" beyond rows 1 and 19 respectively. 

Papyrus<====>23664<====>Papyrus  Papyrus   is a material similar to thick paper that was used in ancient times as a writing surface.  It was made from the pith of the papyrus plant, Cyperus papyrus, a wetland sedge.Papyrus (plural: papyri) can also refer to a document written on sheets of such material, joined together side by side and rolled up into a scroll, an early form of a book. Papyrus is first known to have been used in ancient Egypt (at least as far back as the First Dynasty), as the papyrus plant was  once abundant across the Nile Delta. 

Pixel<====>23665<====>Pixel In digital imaging, a pixel, pel,  dots, or picture element  is a physical point in a raster image, or the smallest addressable element in an all points addressable display device; so it is the smallest controllable element of a picture represented on the screen. Each pixel is a sample of an original image; more samples typically provide more accurate representations of the original.  The intensity of each pixel is variable.  In color imaging systems, a color is typically represented by three or four component intensities such as red, green, and blue, or cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. 

Prime number<====>23666<====>Prime number  A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.  A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number.  For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product,   or  , involve 5 itself. However 6 is composite because it is the product   of two numbers that are both smaller than 6.  Primes are central in number theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order. 

Piers Anthony<====>23669<====>Piers Anthony  Piers Anthony Dillingham Jacob (born 6 August 1934 in Oxford, England)  is an English American author in the science fiction and fantasy genres, publishing under the name Piers Anthony.  He is most famous for his long-running novel series set in the fictional realm of Xanth. Many of his books have appeared on The New York Times Best Seller list.  He has stated that one of his greatest achievements has been to publish a book beginning with every letter of the alphabet, from Anthonology to Zombie Lover. Early lifeAnthony's parents, Alfred and Norma Jacob, were Quaker pacifists studying at Oxford University who interrupted their studies in 1936 to undertake relief work on behalf of the Quakers during the Spanish Civil War, establishing a food kitchen for children in Barcelona. 

Perfect number<====>23670<====>Perfect number In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum).  Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself) i. e.  σ 1 (n) = 2n. This definition is ancient, appearing as early as Euclid's Elements (VII. 22) where it is called   (perfect, ideal, or complete number).  Euclid also proved a formation rule (IX. 36) whereby  q(q+1)/2  is an even perfect number whenever  q  is a prime of the form  2^p -1  for prime  p —what is now called a Mersenne prime. 

Parthenon<====>23672<====>Parthenon The Parthenon ( ;  ;  , Parthenónas) is a former temple,  on the Athenian Acropolis, Greece, dedicated to the goddess Athena, whom the people of Athens considered their patron.  Construction began in 447 BC when the Athenian Empire was at the peak of its power.  It was completed in 438 BC although decoration of the building continued until 432 BC.  It is the most important surviving building of Classical Greece, generally considered the zenith of the Doric order.  Its decorative sculptures are considered some of the high points of Greek art. 

Pachomius the Great<====>23673<====>Pachomius the Great   Saint Pachomius ( ,   ca.  292–348), also known as Pachome and Pakhomius ( ), is generally recognized as the founder of Christian cenobitic monasticism.  Coptic churches celebrate his feast day on 9 May, and Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches mark his feast on 15 May  or 28 May.   In the Lutheran Church, the saint is remembered as a renewer of the church, along with his contemporary (and fellow desert saint), Anthony of Egypt on January 17.  LifeSaint Pachomius was born in 292 in Thebes (Luxor, Egypt) to pagan parents. 

Philosophical Investigations<====>23674<====>Philosophical Investigations  Philosophical Investigations ( ) is a work by the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, first published, posthumously, in 1953, in which Wittgenstein discusses numerous problems and puzzles in the fields of semantics, logic, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of psychology, philosophy of action, and philosophy of mind.  He puts forth the view that conceptual confusions surrounding language use are at the root of most philosophical problems, contradicting or discarding much of what he argued in his earlier work, the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921). He alleges that the problems are traceable to a set of related assumptions about the nature of language, which themselves presuppose a particular conception of the essence of language. 

Poul Anderson<====>23677<====>Poul Anderson   Poul William Anderson (November 25, 1926 – July 31, 2001)  was an American science fiction author who began his career in the 1940s and continued to write into the 21st century.  Anderson authored several works of fantasy, historical novels, and short stories.  His awards include seven Hugo Awards and three Nebula Awards.  BiographyPoul Anderson was born on November 25, 1926, in Bristol, Pennsylvania, of Scandinavian parents.  Shortly after his birth, his father, Anton Anderson, an engineer, moved the family to Texas, where they lived for over ten years.  Following Anton Anderson's death, his widow took her children to Denmark. 

Panspermia<====>23678<====>PanspermiaPanspermia ( ) is the hypothesis that life exists throughout the Universe, distributed by space dust,    meteoroids,    asteroids, comets,    planetoids,  and also by spacecraft in the form of unintended contamination by microorganisms.  Forward planetary  contamination like Tersicoccus phoenicis, that has shown resistance to methods usually used in spacecraft assembly clean rooms: Panspermia is a hypothesis proposing that microscopic life forms that can survive the effects of space, such as extremophiles, become trapped in debris ejected into space after collisions between planets and small Solar System bodies that harbor life. 

There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom<====>23680<====>There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom" was a lecture given by physicist Richard Feynman at an American Physical Society meeting at Caltech on December 29, 1959.   Feynman considered the possibility of direct manipulation of individual atoms as a more powerful form of synthetic chemistry than those used at the time.   The talk went unnoticed and did not inspire the conceptual beginnings of the field.  In the 1990s it was rediscovered and publicised as a seminal event in the field, probably to boost  the history of nanotechnology with Feynman's reputation. 

Philately<====>23681<====>Philately  Philately (   ) is the study of stamps and postal history and other related items.  It also refers to the collection, appreciation and research activities on stamps and other philatelic products.  Philately involves more than just stamp collecting, which does not necessarily involve the study of stamps.  It is possible to be a philatelist without owning any stamps.   For instance, the stamps being studied may be very rare, or reside only in museums. EtymologyThe word "philately" is the English version of the French word "philatélie", coined by Georges Herpin in 1864. 

Puget Sound<====>23682<====>Puget Sound   Puget Sound   is a sound along the northwestern coast of the U. S.  state of Washington, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, and part of the Salish Sea.  It is a complex estuarine    system of interconnected marine waterways and basins, with one major and two minor connections to the open Pacific Ocean via the Strait of Juan de Fuca—Admiralty Inlet being the major connection and Deception Pass and Swinomish Channel being the minor. Water flow through Deception Pass is approximately equal to 2% of the total tidal exchange between Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. 

Perjury<====>23688<====>Perjury   Perjury is the intentional act of swearing a false oath or falsifying an affirmation to tell the truth, whether spoken or in writing, concerning matters material to an official proceeding.   "Perjury The act or an instance of a person’s deliberately making material false or misleading statements while under oath.  – Also termed false swearing; false oath; (archaically forswearing. "    Contrary to popular misconception, no crime has occurred when a false statement is (intentionally or unintentionally) made while under oath or subject to penalty.  Instead, criminal culpability attaches only at the instant the declarant falsely asserts the truth of statements (made or to be made) that are material to the outcome of the proceeding.

Phosphate<====>23690<====>Phosphate  A phosphate ( ) is an inorganic chemical and a salt-forming anion of phosphoric acid.  In organic chemistry, a phosphate, or organophosphate, is an ester of phosphoric acid.  Of the various phosphoric acids and phosphates, organic phosphates are important in biochemistry and biogeochemistry, also called ecology, and inorganic phosphates are mined to obtain phosphorus for use in agriculture and industry.At elevated temperatures in the solid state, phosphates can condense to form pyrophosphates. In biology, adding phosphates to—and removing them from—proteins in cells are both pivotal in the regulation of metabolic processes. 

Prime number theorem<====>23692<====>Prime number theoremIn number theory, the prime number theorem (PNT) describes the asymptotic distribution of the prime numbers among the positive integers.  It formalizes the intuitive idea that primes become less common as they become larger by precisely quantifying the rate at which this occurs.   The theorem was proved independently by Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin in 1896 using ideas introduced by Bernhard Riemann (in particular, the Riemann zeta function). The first such distribution found is  , where   is the prime-counting function and   is the natural logarithm of  . 

Conflict of laws<====>23693<====>Conflict of laws  Conflict of laws or private international law (both terms are used interchangeably)  concerns relations across different legal jurisdictions between natural persons, and sometimes also companies, corporations and other legal entities.   Choice of lawsCourts faced with a choice of law issue have a two-stage process:the court will apply the law of the forum (lex fori) to all procedural matters (including, self-evidently, the choice of law rules); andit counts the factors that connect or link the legal issues to the laws of potentially relevant states and applies the laws that have the greatest connection, e.

International Fixed Calendar<====>23698<====>International Fixed CalendarThe International Fixed Calendar (also known as the Cotsworth plan, the Eastman plan, the 13 Month calendar or the Equal Month calendar) is a solar calendar proposal for calendar reform designed by Moses B.  Cotsworth, who presented it in 1902.   It divides the solar year into 13 months of 28 days each.  It is therefore a perennial calendar, with every date fixed to the same weekday every year.  Though it was never officially adopted in any country, entrepreneur George Eastman adopted it for use in his Eastman Kodak Company, where it was used from 1928 to 1989. 

Potential energy<====>23703<====>Potential energy  In physics, potential energy is the energy possessed by an object because of its position relative to other objects, stresses within itself, its electric charge, or other factors.   Common types of potential energy include the gravitational potential energy of an object that depends on its mass and its distance from the center of mass of another object, the elastic potential energy of an extended spring, and the electric potential energy of an electric charge in an electric field.  The unit for energy in the International System of Units (SI) is the joule, which has the symbol J. 

Pyramid<====>23704<====>Pyramid A pyramid (from    )   is a structure whose outer surfaces are triangular and converge to a single point at the top, making the shape roughly a pyramid in the geometric sense.  The base of a pyramid can be trilateral, quadrilateral, or any polygon shape.  As such, a pyramid has at least three outer triangular surfaces (at least four faces including the base).  The square pyramid, with square base and four triangular outer surfaces, is a common version. A pyramid's design, with the majority of the weight closer to the ground,  and with the pyramidion on top means that less material higher up on the pyramid will be pushing down from above. 

Predestination<====>23705<====>Predestination  Predestination, in theology, is the doctrine that all events have been willed by God, usually with reference to the eventual fate of the individual soul.   Explanations of predestination often seek to address the "paradox of free will", whereby God's omniscience seems incompatible with human free will.  In this usage, predestination can be regarded as a form of religious determinism; and usually predeterminism. ChristianityHistoryNew Testament periodThere is some disagreement among scholars regarding the views on predestination of first-century AD Judaism, out of which Christianity came.  Josephus wrote during the first century that the three main Jewish sects differed on this question. 

Primitive notion<====>23706<====>Primitive notionIn mathematics, logic, and formal systems, a primitive notion is an undefined concept.  In particular, a primitive notion is not defined in terms of previously defined concepts, but is only motivated informally, usually by an appeal to intuition and everyday experience.  In an axiomatic theory or other formal system, the role of a primitive notion is analogous to that of axiom.  In axiomatic theories, the primitive notions are sometimes said to be "defined" by one or more axioms, but this can be misleading.  Formal theories cannot dispense with primitive notions, under pain of infinite regress. 

Priest<====>23707<====>Priest A priest or priestess (feminine) (  from  Greek πρεσβύτερος presbýteros through Latin presbyter, "elder", or from Old High German priast, prest, from Vulgar Latin "provost" "one put over others", from Latin praepositus "person placed in charge"), is a religious leader authorized to perform the sacred rituals of a religion, especially as a mediatory agent between humans and one or more deities.  They also have the authority or power to administer religious rites; in particular, rites of sacrifice to, and propitiation of, a deity or deities.  Their office or position is the priesthood, a term which also may apply to such persons collectively. 

PL/I<====>23708<====>PL/I  PL/I (Programming Language One, pronounced  ) is a procedural, imperative computer programming language designed for scientific, engineering, business and system programming uses.  It has been used by various academic, commercial and industrial organizations since it was introduced in the 1960s, and continues to be actively used.  PL/I's main domains are data processing, numerical computation, scientific computing, and system programming; it supports recursion, structured programming, linked data structure handling, fixed-point, floating-point, complex, character string handling, and bit string handling.  The language syntax is English-like and suited for describing complex data formats, with a wide set of functions available to verify and manipulate them. 

Punctuation<====>23711<====>Punctuation   Punctuation (formerly sometimes called pointing) is the use of spacing, conventional signs, and certain typographical devices as aids to the understanding and the correct reading, both silently and aloud, of handwritten and printed texts.   Another description is: "The practice, action, or system of inserting points or other small marks into texts, in order to aid interpretation; division of text into sentences, clauses, etc. , by means of such marks. " Oxford English Dictionary, definition 2a.  In written English, punctuation is vital to disambiguate the meaning of sentences.  For example: "woman, without her man, is nothing" (emphasizing the importance of men), and "woman: without her, man is nothing" (emphasizing the importance of women) have very different meanings; as do "eats shoots and leaves" (which means the subject consumes plant growths) and "eats, shoots, and leaves" (which means the subject eats first, then fires a weapon, and then leaves the scene). 

Pentomino<====>23712<====>PentominoA pentomino (or 5-omino) is a polyomino of order 5, that is, a polygon in the plane made of 5 equal-sized squares connected edge-to-edge.   When rotations and reflections are not considered to be distinct shapes, there are 12 different free pentominoes.  When reflections are considered distinct, there are 18 one-sided pentominoes.  When rotations are also considered distinct, there are 63 fixed pentominoes. Pentomino tiling puzzles and games are popular in recreational mathematics.  Eric Harshbarger - Pentominoes  Usually, video games such as Tetris imitations and Rampart consider mirror reflections to be distinct, and thus use the full set of 18 one-sided pentominoes. 

Programmer<====>23716<====>Programmer    A programmer, computer programmer, developer, dev, coder, or software engineer is a person who creates computer software.  The term computer programmer can refer to a specialist in one area of computer programming or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software.  One who practices or professes a formal approach to programming may also be known as a programmer analyst. A programmer's primary computer language (Assembly, COBOL, C, C++, C#, Java, Lisp, Python, etc. ) is often prefixed to these titles, and those who work in a web environment often prefix their titles with web. 

Periodic table (large cells)<====>23719<====>Periodic table (large cells) This page shows large-cell versions of the periodic table.  For each element name, symbol, atomic number, and mean atomic mass value for the natural isotopic composition of each element are shown.  The periodic table of the chemical elements is a tabular method of displaying the chemical elements. The two layout forms originate from two graphic forms of presentation of the same periodic table.  Historically, when the f-block was identified it was drawn below the existing table, with markings for its in-table location (this page uses dots or asterisks).  Also, a common presentation is to put all 15 lanthanide and actinide columns below, while the f-block only has 14 columns. 

Peter Singer<====>23721<====>Peter Singer    Peter Albert David Singer, AC (born 6 July 1946) is an Australian moral philosopher.  He is the Ira W.  DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University, and a Laureate Professor at the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics at the University of Melbourne.  He specialises in applied ethics and approaches ethical issues from a secular, utilitarian perspective.  He is known in particular for his book Animal Liberation (1975), in which he argues in favour of vegetarianism, and his essay "Famine, Affluence, and Morality," in which he argues in favour of donating to help the global poor. 

Poznań<====>23723<====>PoznańPoznań (   ;;  ; known also by other historical names) is a city on the Warta River in west-central Poland, in the Greater Poland region.  It is best known for its renaissance Old Town and Ostrów Tumski Cathedral.  Today, Poznań is an important cultural and business centre and one of Poland's most populous regions with many regional customs such as Saint John's Fair (Jarmark Świętojański), traditional Saint Martin's croissants and a local dialect. Poznań is among the oldest and largest cities in Poland.  The city population is about 550,000, while the continuous conurbation with Poznań County and several other communities is inhabited by almost 1. 

Peter Falk<====>23725<====>Peter Falk   Peter Michael Falk ( ; September 16, 1927 – June 23, 2011) was an American actor, best known for his role as Lieutenant Columbo in the long-running television series Columbo (1968–2003), for which he received four Primetime Emmy Awards and one Golden Globe Award.  He was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, first for Murder, Inc.  (1960) and again for Pocketful of Miracles (1961).  Falk further appeared in films such as It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), The Great Race (1965), Anzio (1968), A Woman Under the Influence (1974), Murder by Death (1976), The Cheap Detective (1978), The Princess Bride (1987),  Wings of Desire (1987), The Player (1992), Corky Romano (2001) and Next (2007), as well as many television guest roles. 

Pixies<====>23726<====>Pixies   The Pixies are an American alternative rock band formed in 1986 in Boston, Massachusetts.  The original line-up comprised Black Francis (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Joey Santiago (lead guitar), Kim Deal (bass, backing vocals) and David Lovering (drums).  The band disbanded acrimoniously in 1993, but reunited in 2004.  After Deal left in 2013, the Pixies hired Kim Shattuck as a touring bassist; she was replaced the same year by Paz Lenchantin, who became a permanent member in 2016. The Pixies' music contains elements including psychedelia, noise pop, hard rock, and surf rock.  Francis is the Pixies' primary songwriter; his often surreal lyrics cover offbeat subjects such as extraterrestrials, incest, and biblical violence. 

Plasma ashing<====>23731<====>Plasma ashing In semiconductor manufacturing plasma ashing is the process of removing the photoresist (light sensitive coating) from an etched wafer.  Using a plasma source, a monatomic (single atom) substance known as a reactive species is generated.  Oxygen or fluorine are the most common reactive species.   The reactive species combines with the photoresist to form ash which is removed with a vacuum pump. Typically, monatomic oxygen plasma is created by exposing oxygen gas at a low pressure (O 2 ) to high power radio waves, which ionise it.  This process is done under vacuum in order to create a plasma. 

Psychophysiology<====>23732<====>Psychophysiology Psychophysiology (from Greek  , psȳkhē, "breath, life, soul";  , physis, "nature, origin"; and  ,  ) is the branch of psychology that is concerned with the physiological bases of psychological processes.   While psychophysiology was a general broad field of research in the 1960s and 1970s, it has now become quite specialized, and has branched into subspecializations such as social psychophysiology, cardiovascular psychophysiology, cognitive psychophysiology, and cognitive neuroscience. Background Some people have difficulty distinguishing a psychophysiologist from a physiological psychologist, two very different perspectives.  Psychologists are interested in why we may fear spiders and physiologists may be interested in the input/output system of the amygdala. 

Periodization<====>23733<====>Periodization  Periodization is the process or study of categorizing the past into discrete, quantified named blocks of time Adam Rabinowitz.  It’s about time: historical periodization and Linked Ancient World Data.  Institute for the Study of the Ancient World Papers, 2014.   in order to facilitate the study and analysis of history.  This results in descriptive abstractions that provide convenient terms for periods of time with relatively stable characteristics.  However, determining the precise beginning and ending to any "period" is often arbitrary.  It has changed over time in history. To the extent that history is continuous and ungeneralizable, all systems of periodization are more or less arbitrary. 

Petrarch<====>23734<====>Petrarch   Francesco Petrarca ( ; July 20, 1304 – July 19, 1374), commonly anglicized as Petrarch ( ), was an Italian scholar and poet in Renaissance Italy, who was one of the earliest humanists.  His rediscovery of Cicero's letters is often credited with initiating the 14th-century Renaissance.  Petrarch is often considered the founder of Humanism.   In the 16th century, Pietro Bembo created the model for the modern Italian language based on Petrarch's works, as well as those of Giovanni Boccaccio, and, to a lesser extent, Dante Alighieri.   Petrarch would be later endorsed as a model for Italian style by the Accademia della Crusca.

Propeller<====>23738<====>Propeller  A propeller is a type of fan that transmits power by converting rotational motion into thrust.  A pressure difference is produced between the forward and rear surfaces of the airfoil-shaped blade, and a fluid (such as air or water) is accelerated behind the blade.  Propeller dynamics, like those of aircraft wings, can be modelled by either or both Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law.  A marine propeller of this type is sometimes colloquially known as a screw propeller or screw, however there is a different class of propellers known as cycloidal propellers – they are characterized by the higher propulsive efficiency averaging 0. 

Peter Duesberg<====>23739<====>Peter Duesberg  Peter H.  Duesberg (born December 2, 1936) is a German American molecular biologist and a professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley.  He is known for his early research into genetic aspects of cancer, and more recently for his central role in the AIDS denialism movement as a proponent of the belief that HIV is harmless and does not cause AIDS.  Duesberg received acclaim early in his career for research on oncogenes and cancer.  With Peter K.  Vogt, he reported in 1970 that a cancer-causing virus of birds had extra genetic material compared with non-cancer-causing viruses, hypothesizing that this material contributed to cancer. 

Toxin<====>23740<====>Toxin  A toxin (from  ) is a poisonous substance produced within living cells or organisms;synthetic toxicants created by artificial processes are thus excluded.  The term was first used by organic chemist Ludwig Brieger (1849–1919).  Toxins can be small molecules, peptides, or proteins that are capable of causing disease on contact with or absorption by body tissues interacting with biological macromolecules such as enzymes or cellular receptors.  Toxins vary greatly in their toxicity, ranging from usually minor (such as a bee sting) to almost immediately deadly (such as botulinum toxin). TerminologyToxins are often distinguished from other chemical agents by their method of production—the word toxin does not specify method of delivery (compare with venom and the broader meaning of poison—all substances that can also cause disturbances to organisms). 

Philadelphia Phillies<====>23741<====>Philadelphia Phillies   The Philadelphia Phillies are an American professional baseball team based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  They are the oldest continuous, one-name, one-city franchise in all of professional American sports, dating back to 1883.   The Phillies compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) East division.   Since 2004, the team's home has been Citizens Bank Park, located in South Philadelphia. The Phillies have won two World Series championships (against the Kansas City Royals in   and the Tampa Bay Rays in  ) and seven National League pennants, the first of which came in 1915. 

Phanerozoic<====>23743<====>Phanerozoic The Phanerozoic Eon  (British English Phanærozoic) is the current geologic eon in the geologic time scale, and the one during which abundant animal and plant life has existed.  It covers   million years to the present,  and began with the Cambrian Period when diverse hard-shelled animals first appeared.  Its name was derived from the Ancient Greek words   (phanerós) and   (zōḗ), meaning visible life, since it was once believed that life began in the Cambrian, the first period of this eon.  The time before the Phanerozoic, called the Precambrian supereon, is now divided into the Hadean, Archaean and Proterozoic eons. 

Pokémon<====>23745<====>Pokémonis a media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, a Japanese consortium between Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.   The franchise copyright is shared by all three companies, but Nintendo is the sole owner of the trademark.The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1995,  and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokémon", which humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other for sport. The franchise began as a pair of video games for the original Game Boy that were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo. 

Paul the Deacon<====>23746<====>Paul the DeaconPaul the Deacon  (  720s   13 April 799 AD), also known as Paulus Diaconus, Warnefridus, Barnefridus, Winfridus and sometimes suffixed Cassinensis (i. e.  "of Monte Cassino"), was a Benedictine monk, scribe, and historian of the Lombards. LifeAn ancestor named Leupichis entered Italy in the train of Alboin and received lands at or near Forum Julii (Cividale del Friuli).  During an invasion, the Avars swept off the five sons of this warrior into Pannonia, but one, his namesake, returned to Italy and restored the ruined fortunes of his house.  The grandson of the younger Leupichis was Warnefrid, who by his wife Theodelinda became the father of Paul. 

Peroxide<====>23747<====>Peroxide Peroxide is a compound with the structure R-O-O-R  The O−O group in a peroxide is called the peroxide group or peroxo group.  In contrast to oxide ions, the oxygen atoms in the peroxide ion have an oxidation state of −1. The most common peroxide is hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), colloquially known as "peroxide. " It is marketed as a solution in water at various concentrations.   Since hydrogen peroxide is colorless, so are these solutions.  It is mainly used as an oxidant and bleaching agent.   Concentrated solutions are potentially dangerous when in contact with organic compounds. 

Photolithography<====>23748<====>Photolithography Photolithography, also termed optical lithography or UV lithography, is a process used in  microfabrication to pattern parts of a thin film or the bulk of a substrate.  It uses light to transfer a geometric pattern from a photomask to a light-sensitive chemical "photoresist", or simply "resist," on the substrate.  A series of chemical treatments then either engraves the exposure pattern into, or enables deposition of a new material in the desired pattern upon the material underneath the photo resist.  For example, in complex integrated circuits, a modern CMOS wafer will go through the photolithographic cycle up to 50 times. 

Platypus<====>23749<====>Platypus The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), sometimes referred to as the duck-billed platypus, is a semiaquatic egg-laying mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania.  Together with the four species of echidna, it is one of the five   species of monotremes, the only mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young.  The animal is the sole living representative of its family (Ornithorhynchidae) and genus (Ornithorhynchus), though a number of related species appear in the fossil record.  The first scientists to examine a preserved platypus body (in 1799)    judged it a fake, made of several animals sewn together. 

Paramagnetism<====>23750<====>ParamagnetismParamagnetism is a form of magnetism whereby certain materials are weakly attracted by an externally applied magnetic field, and form internal, induced magnetic fields in the direction of the applied magnetic field.  In contrast with this behavior, diamagnetic materials are repelled by magnetic fields and form induced magnetic fields in the direction opposite to that of the applied magnetic field.   Paramagnetic materials include most chemical elements and some compounds;  they have a relative magnetic permeability slightly greater than 1 (i. e. , a small positive magnetic susceptibility) and hence are attracted to magnetic fields.  The magnetic moment induced by the applied field is linear in the field strength and rather weak. 

Parapsychology<====>23754<====>Parapsychology Parapsychology is a field of study concerned with the investigation of paranormal and psychic phenomena which include telepathy, precognition, clairvoyance, psychokinesis, near-death experiences, reincarnation, apparitional experiences, and other paranormal claims.  It is identified as pseudoscience by a majority of mainstream scientists.   Parapsychology research is largely conducted by private institutions in several countries and funded through private donations,and the subject rarely appears in mainstream science journals.  Most papers about parapsychology are published in a small number of niche journals.  (Pigliucci, Boudry 2013) "Parapsychological research almost never appears in mainstream science journals. 

Presburger arithmetic<====>23756<====>Presburger arithmeticPresburger arithmetic is the first-order theory of the natural numbers with addition, named in honor of Mojżesz Presburger, who introduced it in 1929.  The signature of Presburger arithmetic contains only the addition operation and equality, omitting the multiplication operation entirely.  The axioms include a schema of induction. Presburger arithmetic is much weaker than Peano arithmetic, which includes both addition and multiplication operations.  Unlike Peano arithmetic, Presburger arithmetic is a decidable theory.  This means it is possible to algorithmically determine, for any sentence in the language of Presburger arithmetic, whether that sentence is provable from the axioms of Presburger arithmetic. 

Purdue University<====>23757<====>Purdue University   Purdue University  is a public research university located in West Lafayette, Indiana and is the main campus of the Purdue University system.   The university was founded in 1869 after Lafayette businessman John Purdue donated land and money to establish a college of science, technology, and agriculture in his name.The first classes were held on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students.  The main campus in West Lafayette offers more than 200 majors for undergraduates, over 69 masters and doctoral programs, and professional degrees in pharmacy and veterinary medicine. 

Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite<====>23758<====>Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite    Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite ( ), also known as Pseudo-Denys, was a Christian theologian and philosopher of the late 5th to early 6th century, who wrote a set of works known as the Corpus Areopagiticum or Corpus Dionysiacum. The author pseudonymously identifies himself in the corpus as "Dionysios", portraying himself as the figure of Dionysius the Areopagite, the Athenian convert of Paul the Apostle mentioned in  .   This false attribution to the earliest decades of Christianity resulted in the work being given great authority in subsequent theological writing in both East and West. 

Perfect crystal<====>23759<====>Perfect crystalCrystalline materials (mainly metals and alloys, but also stoichiometric salts and other materials) are made up of solid regions of ordered matter (atoms placed in one of a number of ordered formations called Bravais lattices).   These regions are known as crystals.   A perfect crystal is one that contains no point, linear, or planar imperfections.   There are a wide variety of crystallographic defects. The hypothetical concept of a perfect crystal is important in the basic formulation of the third law of thermodynamics. In crystallography, the phrase 'perfect crystal' can be used to mean “no line or planar defects”, as it is difficult to measure small quantities of point defects in an otherwise defect-free crystal. 

Pope Linus<====>23761<====>Pope Linus  Linus ( ; died c.  AD 76) was, according to several early sources, the second Bishop of Rome, and is listed by the Catholic Church as the second pope. His papacy lasted from c.  AD 67 to his death.  According to other early sources, Pope Clement I was the second pope; according to the Catholic Church's Annuario Pontificio, however, Clement I was the fourth pope.  Among those believed by the Catholic Church to have held the position of pope, only Peter, Linus and Clement are specifically mentioned in the New Testament.  Kirsch, Johann Peter (1910). 

Pilgrimage<====>23763<====>Pilgrimage A pilgrimage is a journey or search of moral or spiritual significance.  Typically, it is a journey to a shrine or other location of importance to a person's beliefs and faith, although sometimes it can be a metaphorical journey into someone's own beliefs.  Many religions attach spiritual importance to particular places: the place of birth or death of founders or saints, or to the place of their "calling" or spiritual awakening, or of their connection (visual or verbal) with the divine,  to locations where miracles were performed or witnessed, or locations where a deity is said to live or be "housed", or any site that is seen to have special spiritual powers.

Paul Keating<====>23767<====>Paul Keating    Paul John Keating (born 18 January 1944) is an Australian politician who was the 24th Prime Minister of Australia and the Leader of the Labor Party from 1991 to 1996.  Keating represented the division of Blaxland in the Australian House of Representatives and served as Minister for Northern Australia in the Whitlam government and as Treasurer of Australia and the 7th Deputy Prime Minister of Australia in the government of Bob Hawke. Keating was appointed Treasurer by newly elected Prime Minister Hawke in 1983.  Although lacking any formal education in economics, Keating went on to become arguably  one of the most reforming Treasurers in Australian history. 

Paolo Agostino<====>23769<====>Paolo AgostinoPaolo Agostino (or Agostini; Augustinus in Latin; c.  1583 – 1629) was an Italian composer and organist of the early Baroque era.  He was born perhaps at Vallerano, near Viterbo.  He studied under Giovanni Bernardino Nanino, according to the dedication in the third and fourth books of his masses.  Subsequently, he married Nanino's daughter.  He held a series of positions as organist and maestro di cappella (choirmaster) between 1607 and 1626, when he succeeded Vincenzo Ugolini as maestro of the Cappella Giulia's choir in St.  Peter's Basilica. All of his surviving works are sacred music, and most are written in the prima pratica, the conservative polyphonic style of the late 16th century, although some of his motets use some of the new concertato style. 

Pavel Urysohn<====>23770<====>Pavel UrysohnPavel Samuilovich Urysohn ( ) (February 3, 1898 – August 17, 1924) was a Soviet  mathematician of Jewish origin who is best known for his contributions in dimension theory, and for developing Urysohn's Metrization Theorem and Urysohn's Lemma, both of which are fundamental results in topology.  His name is also commemorated in the terms Urysohn universal space, Fréchet–Urysohn space, Menger–Urysohn dimension and Urysohn integral equation.  He and Pavel Alexandrov formulated the modern definition of compactness in 1923. Born in 1898 in Odessa, Urysohn studied at Moscow University from 1915 to 1921.  His advisor was Nikolai Luzin. 

Pluot<====>23772<====>Pluot Pluots, apriums, apriplums, or plumcots, are some of the hybrids between different Prunus species that are also called interspecific plums.  In the United States and Canada, these fruits are known by most regulatory agencies as interspecific plums.   Whereas plumcots and apriplums are first-generation hybrids between a plum parent (P.  salicina or P.  cerasifera or their hybrids), and an apricot (P.  armeniaca), pluots and apriums are later-generations. Both names "plumcot" and "apriplum" have been used for trees derived from a plum seed parent, and are therefore equivalent.  US patent PP4338 Plumcot tree  US patent PP19519 Plumcots and apriplumsNatural plumcots/apriplums have been known for hundreds of years from regions of the world that grow both plums and apricots from seed. 

Pascal (programming language)<====>23773<====>Pascal (programming language) Pascal is an imperative and procedural programming language, which Niklaus Wirth designed in 1968–69 and published in 1970, as a small, efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices using structured programming and data structuring.  It is named in honor of the French mathematician, philosopher and physicist Blaise Pascal. Pascal was developed on the pattern of the ALGOL 60 language.  Wirth had already developed several improvements to this language as part of the ALGOL X proposals, but these were not accepted and Pascal was developed separately and released in 1970.  A derivative known as Object Pascal designed for object-oriented programming was developed in 1985; this was used by Apple Computer and Borland in the late 1980s and later developed into Delphi on the Microsoft Windows platform. 

Paint<====>23776<====>Paint    Paint is any liquid, liquefiable, or   composition that, after application to a substrate in a thin layer, converts to a solid film.  It is most commonly used to protect, color, or provide texture to objects.  Paint can be made or purchased in many colors—and in many different types, such as watercolor, synthetic, etc.  Paint is typically stored, sold, and applied as a liquid, but most types dry into a solid. HistoryIn 2001 and 2004, South African archeologists reported finds in Blombos Cave of a 100,000-year-old human-made ochre-based mixture that could have been used like paint. 

Photoresist<====>23781<====>Photoresist A photoresist is a light-sensitive material used in several processes, such as photolithography and photoengraving, to form a patterned coating on a surface.  This process is crucial in the electronic industry.  The process begins by coating a substrate with a light-sensitive organic material.  A patterned mask is then applied to the surface to block light, so that only unmasked regions of the material will be exposed to light.  A solvent, called a developer, is then applied to the surface.   In the case of a positive photoresist, the photo-sensitive material is degraded by light and the developer will dissolve away the regions that were exposed to light, leaving behind a coating where the mask was placed. 

Phrenology<====>23785<====>Phrenology    Phrenology ( ) is a pseudomedicine primarily focused on measurements of the human skull, based on the concept that the brain is the organ of the mind, and that certain brain areas have localized, specific functions or modules.   Although both of those ideas have a basis in reality, phrenology   beyond empirical knowledge in a way that departed from science.  Developed by German physician Franz Joseph Gall in 1796,  the discipline was very popular in the 19th century, especially from about 1810 until 1840.  The principal British centre for phrenology was Edinburgh, where the Edinburgh Phrenological Society was established in 1820. 

Pope Alexander IV<====>23787<====>Pope Alexander IV Pope Alexander IV (1199 or ca.  1185 – 25 May 1261) was Pope from 12 December 1254 to his death in 1261. Born as Rinaldo di Jenne in Jenne  (now in the Province of Rome), he was, on his mother's side, a member of the family de' Conti di Segni, the counts of Segni, like Pope Innocent III and Pope Gregory IX.  His uncle Gregory IX made him cardinal deacon and Protector of the Order of Franciscans in 1227, Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church from 1227 until 1231 and Bishop of Ostia in 1231 (or 1232). 

Pope Alexander VII<====>23789<====>Pope Alexander VII  Pope Alexander VII (13 February 1599 22 May 1667), born Fabio Chigi, was Pope from 7 April 1655 to his death in 1667.   Note on numbering: Pope Alexander V is now considered an anti-pope.  At the time however, this fact was not recognised and so the fifth true Pope Alexander took the official number VI.  This caused the true sixth Pope Alexander to take the number VII.  This has advanced the numbering of all subsequent Popes Alexander by one.  Popes Alexander VI-VIII are really the fifth through seventh popes by that name. 

Pope Alexander VIII<====>23790<====>Pope Alexander VIII    Pope Alexander VIII (22 April 1610 – 1 February 1691), born Pietro Vito Ottoboni, was Pope from 6 October 1689 to his death in 1691.  He is the last pope to take the pontifical name of "Alexander" upon his election to the papacy. BiographyEarly lifePietro Vito Ottoboni was born in 1610 of a noble Venetian family,    and was the youngest of nine children of Vittoria Tornielli and Marco Ottoboni, grand chancellor of the Republic of Venice.    His early studies were made with marked brilliance at the University of Padua where, in 1627, he earned a doctorate in canon and civil law. 

Pope Alexander VI<====>23791<====>Pope Alexander VI    Pope Alexander VI, born Rodrigo de Borja (   ,    ; 1 January 1431 – 18 August 1503), was Pope from 11 August 1492 until his death.  He is one of the most controversial of the Renaissance popes, partly because he acknowledged fathering several children by his mistresses.  Therefore his Italianized Valencian surname, Borgia, became a byword for libertinism and nepotism, which are traditionally considered as characterizing his pontificate.  Two of Alexander's successors, the controversial pontiffs Sixtus V and Urban VIII, described him as one of the most outstanding popes since Saint Peter. 

Pope Alexander II<====>23792<====>Pope Alexander II   Pope Alexander II (1010/1015 – 21 April 1073), born Anselm of Baggio ( ),  was Pope from 30 September 1061 to his death in 1073.  Born in Milan, Anselm was deeply involved the Pataria reform movement.  Elected according to the terms of his predecessor's bull, In nomine Domini, Anselm's was the first election by the cardinals without the participation of the people and minor clergy of Rome.  Early life and workAnselm was born in Milan of a noble family.  Contemporary sources do not provide any information where Anselm might obtain his education. 

Pope Alexander III<====>23793<====>Pope Alexander III   Pope Alexander III (c.  1100/1105 – 30 August 1181), born Roland of Siena,  was Pope from 7 September 1159 to his death in 1181. Through the Papal bull Manifestis Probatum, issued on 23 May 1179, he recognized the right of Afonso I to proclaim himself King of Portugal, thus recognizing Portugal as an independent and sovereign Kingdom.  Peter Linehan and Janet Laughland Nelson, The Medieval World, Vol. 10, (Routledge, 2001), 524.   He also laid the foundation stone for the Notre-Dame de Paris. Early life and careerPope Alexander III was born in Siena. 

Pope Alexander I<====>23794<====>Pope Alexander I Pope Alexander I can also refer to Pope Alexander I of Alexandria.  Pope Alexander I (died c.  115) was the Bishop of Rome from c.  107 to his death c.  115.  The Holy See's Annuario Pontificio (2012) identifies him as a Roman who reigned from 108 or 109 to 116 or 119.  Some believe he suffered martyrdom under the Roman Emperor Trajan or Hadrian, but this is improbable.  Encyclopædia Britannica: Saint Alexander I Life and legendAccording to the Liber Pontificalis, it was Alexander I who inserted the narration of the Last Supper (the Qui pridie) into the liturgy of the Mass. 

Poincaré conjecture<====>23798<====>Poincaré conjecture In mathematics, the Poincaré conjecture ( ;  )  is a theorem about the characterization of the 3-sphere, which is the hypersphere that bounds the unit ball in four-dimensional space.  The conjecture states:   An equivalent form of the conjecture involves a coarser form of equivalence than homeomorphism called homotopy equivalence: if a 3-manifold is homotopy equivalent to the 3-sphere, then it is necessarily homeomorphic to it. Originally conjectured by Henri Poincaré, the theorem concerns a space that locally looks like ordinary three-dimensional space but is connected, finite in size, and lacks any boundary (a closed 3-manifold). 

Power set<====>23799<====>Power set In mathematics, the power set (or powerset) of any set   is the set of all subsets of  , including the empty set and   itself, variously denoted as  ( ), 𝒫( ), ℘( ) (using the "Weierstrass p"),  ,  , or, identifying the powerset of   with the set of all functions from   to a given set of two elements,  .  In axiomatic set theory (as developed, for example, in the ZFC axioms), the existence of the power set of any set is postulated by the axiom of power set. 

Procedural programming<====>23801<====>Procedural programmingProcedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.   Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions (not to be confused with mathematical functions, but similar to those used in functional programming), simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out.   Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself.  The first major procedural programming languages first appeared circa 1960, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL and BASIC.    Pascal and C were published closer to the 1970s, while Ada was released in 1980. 

Pareto index<====>23802<====>Pareto indexIn economics the Pareto index, named after the Italian economist and sociologist Vilfredo Pareto, is a measure of the breadth of income or wealth distribution.   It is one of the parameters specifying a Pareto distribution and embodies the Pareto principle.   As applied to income, the Pareto principle is sometimes stated in popular expositions by saying 20% of the population has 80% of the income.   In fact, Pareto's data on British income taxes in his Cours d'économie politique indicates that about 20% of the population had about 80% of the income.  One of the simplest characterizations of the Pareto distribution, when used to model the distribution of incomes, says that the proportion of the population whose income exceeds any positive number x > x m  is \left(\frac{x_\mathrm{m}}{x}\right)^\alpha where x m  is a positive number, the minimum of the support of this probability distribution (the subscript m stands for minimum). 

Pope Leo III<====>23803<====>Pope Leo III Pope Saint Leo III (d.  June 12, 816) was Pope from  December 26, 795  to his death in 816.   Protected by Charlemagne from his enemies in Rome, he subsequently strengthened Charlemagne's position by crowning him Holy Roman Emperor and "Augustus of the Romans".  Leo was assaulted in Rome by partisans of the late Pope Adrian I, and fled to Charlemagne at Paderborn.  The King of the Franks arbitrated the dispute, restoring Leo to his office.  Leo subsequently crowned Charlemagne Holy Roman Emperor, which was not approved in Constantinople, although the Byzantines, occupied with their own defenses, were in no position to make much opposition. 

Pope Adrian I<====>23804<====>Pope Adrian I  Pope Adrian I (  d.  25 December 795) was Pope from 1 February 772 to his death in 795. He was the son of Theodore, a Roman nobleman. Adrian and his predecessors had to contend with periodic attempts by the Lombards to expand their holdings in Italy at the expense of the papacy.  Not receiving any support from Constantinople, the popes looked for help to the Franks.  Adrian's tenure saw the culmination of on-going territorial disputes between Charlemagne and his brother Carloman.  The Lombard king Desiderius supported the claims of Carloman's sons to their late father's land, and requested Pope Adrian crown Carloman's sons "Kings of the Frank". 

Pope John Paul II<====>23805<====>Pope John Paul II   Pope Saint John Paul II ( ;  ;  ; born Karol Józef Wojtyła;   ;  18 May 1920 – 2 April 2005) served as Pope of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City from 1978 to 2005.  He is called Saint John Paul the Great by some Catholics.    He was elected by the second Papal conclave of 1978, which was called after Pope John Paul I, who had been elected in August to succeed Pope Paul VI, died after thirty-three days. 

Patanjali<====>23806<====>Patanjali ( ) is a proper Indian name.   Several important ancient Sanskrit works are ascribed to one or more authors of this name, and a great deal of scholarship has been devoted over the last century or so to the issue of disambiguation.    lists ten separate authors by the name of "Patañjali. " Amongst the more important authors called Patañjali are:   Gavin A.  Flood, 1996.  The author of the Mahābhāṣya, an ancient treatise on Sanskrit grammar and linguistics, based on the Aṣṭādhyāyī of Pāṇini.  This Patañjali's life is dated to mid 2nd century BCE by both Western and Indian scholars. 

Pope John XXIII<====>23807<====>Pope John XXIII    Pope John XXIII ( ;  ; born Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli,  ; 25 November 1881 3 June 1963) was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Vatican City State from 28 October 1958 to his death in 1963 and was canonized on 27 April 2014.   Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli was the fourth of fourteen children born to a family of sharecroppers who lived in a village in Lombardy.   He was ordained to the priesthood on 10 August 1904 and served in a number of posts, as nuncio in France and a delegate to Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey. 

Pope Pius XII<====>23808<====>Pope Pius XII   Pope Pius XII ( ), born Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli  ( ; 2 March 1876 9 October 1958), was head of the Catholic Church from 2 March 1939 to his death in 1958.  Before his election to the papacy, Pacelli served as secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, papal nuncio to Germany (1917–1929), and Cardinal Secretary of State, in which capacity he worked to conclude treaties with European and Latin American nations, most notably the Reichskonkordat with Nazi Germany, with which most historians believe the Vatican sought to protect the Church in Germany while Adolf Hitler sought the destruction of "political Catholicism". 

Pope John II<====>23809<====>Pope John II  Pope John II ( ; died 8 May 535) was Pope of the Catholic Church from 2 January 533 to his death in 535. LifeHe was born in Rome as Mercurius, son of Projectus.  He became a priest at St.  Clement's Basilica on the Caelian Hill.  The basilica still retains memorials of "Johannes surnamed Mercurius".  A reference to "Presbyter Mercurius" is found on a fragment of an ancient ciborium.  Several marble slabs that enclose the schola cantorum bear upon them, in the style of the sixth century, his monogram.  NameMercurius was elected pope on 2 January 533, becoming the first to adopt a new name upon elevation to the papacy. 

Pope Agapetus I<====>23810<====>Pope Agapetus I   Pope Agapetus I (died 22 April 536) was Pope from 13 May 535 to his death in 536.  He is not to be confused with another Saint Agapetus, an Early Christian martyr with the feast day of 6 August.    FamilyAgapetus was born in Rome, although his exact date of birth is unknown.   He was the son of Gordianus, a Roman priest who had been slain during the riots in the days of Pope Symmachus (term 498–514).   The name of his father might point to a familial relation with two other Popes: Felix III (483–492) and Gregory I (590–604). 

Pope Agatho<====>23811<====>Pope Agatho  Pope Agatho (d.  January 681) served as the Pope from 26 June 678 until his death in 681.   Ott, Michael.  "Pope St.  Agatho. " The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol.  1.  New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907.  12 September 2017   He heard the appeal of Wilfrid of York, who had been displaced from his See by the division of the Archdiocese ordered by Theodore of Canterbury.  During Agatho's tenure, the Sixth Ecumenical Council was convened which dealt with the monothelitism controversy.  He is venerated as a saint by both the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. 

Pope-elect Stephen<====>23812<====>Pope-elect Stephen  Pope-elect Stephen (d.  26 March 752) was a Roman priest elected pope in March 752 to succeed Zachary; he died of a stroke a few days later, before being consecrated a bishop.  Horace Mann, "Pope Stephen II" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 2013)   Therefore, he is not listed as a pope in the Annuario Pontificio. In 745, Pope Zachary had made him a cardinal-priest, with the titulus of San Crisogono, the same titulus later held by Cardinal Frederick of Lorraine, who became Pope Stephen IX. Regnal numbering of popes named StephenThe regnal numbering of popes named Stephen  has changed over the centuries. 

Pope Stephen II<====>23813<====>Pope Stephen II  Pope Stephen II (  (or III); 714-26 April 757  a Roman aristocrat  was Pope from 26 March 752 to his death in 757.  He succeeded Pope Zachary following the death of Pope-elect Stephen (sometimes called Stephen II).  Stephen II marks the historical delineation between the Byzantine Papacy and the Frankish Papacy. The safety of Rome was facing invasion by the Kingdom of the Lombards.  Pope Stephen II traveled all the way to Paris to seek assistance against the Lombard threat from Pepin the Short.  Pepin had been anointed a first time in 751 in Soissons by Boniface, archbishop of Mainz, but named his price. 

Pope Joan<====>23815<====>Pope Joan   Pope Joan (Ioannes Anglicus) was, according to popular legend, a woman who reigned as pope for a few years during the Middle Ages.  Her story first appeared in chronicles in the 13th century and subsequently spread throughout Europe.  The story was widely believed for centuries, but most modern scholars regard it as fictional.    Most versions of her story describe her as a talented and learned woman who disguised herself as a man, often at the behest of a lover.  In the most common accounts, due to her abilities, she rose through the church hierarchy and was eventually elected pope. 

Pierre Allix<====>23816<====>Pierre AllixPierre Allix (1641 – 3 March 1717) was a French Protestant pastor and author.  In 1690 Allix was created Doctor of Divinity by Emmanuel College, Cambridge,  and was given the treasurership and a canonry in Salisbury Cathedral by Bishop Gilbert Burnet.  He discovered that Codex Ephraemi is a palimpsest. LifeBorn in 1641 in Alençon, France, he became a pastor first at Saint-Agobile Champagne, and then at Charenton, near Paris.   The revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 compelled him to take refuge in London.  There he set up a church in Jewin Street, Aldersgate. 

Prospero Alpini<====>23819<====>Prospero Alpini Prospero Alpini (also known as Prosper Alpinus, Prospero Alpinio and Prosper Alpin) (23 November 1553 6 February 1617), was an Italian physician and botanist from the Republic of Venice. Born at Marostica, a town near Vicenza, in his youth he served for a time in the Milanese army, but in 1574 he went to study medicine at Padua.

List of Pokémon<====>23840<====>List of Pokémon The Pokémon franchise revolves around 807 fictional species of collectible monsters, each having unique designs and skills.  Conceived by Satoshi Tajiri in early 1989, Pokémon are creatures that inhabit the fictional Pokémon World.  The designs for the multitude of species can draw inspiration from anything, such as inanimate objects, real-world animals, or mythology.  Many Pokémon are capable of evolving into more powerful species, while others can undergo form changes and achieve similar results.  Originally, only a handful of artists led by Ken Sugimori designed Pokémon.  However, by 2013 a team of 20 artists worked together to create new species designs. 

Planets beyond Neptune<====>23842<====>Planets beyond Neptune  Following the discovery of the planet Neptune in 1846, there was considerable speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit.  The search began in the mid-19th century and culminated at the start of the 20th with Percival Lowell's quest for Planet X.  Lowell proposed the Planet X hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the giant planets, particularly Uranus and Neptune,  speculating that the gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have perturbed Uranus enough to account for the irregularities.  Clyde Tombaugh's discovery of Pluto in 1930 appeared to validate Lowell's hypothesis, and Pluto was officially named the ninth planet. 

Plutino<====>23843<====>Plutino  In astronomy, the plutinos are a dynamical group of trans-Neptunian objects in the outermost region of the Solar System that orbit in 2:3 mean-motion resonance with Neptune.  This means that for every 2 orbits a plutino makes, Neptune orbits 3 times.  The dwarf planet Pluto is the largest member and namesake of this group.  Plutinos are named after mythological creatures associated with the underworld. Plutinos form the inner part of the Kuiper belt and represent about a quarter of the known Kuiper belt objects.  They are the largest class of the resonant trans-Neptunian objects (also see adjunct box with hierarchical listing).

Pocketbike racing<====>23859<====>Pocketbike racing Pocket Bike racing, also known as Minimoto or circus racing, is a category of racing where miniature racing motorcycles (known as pocket bikes or minimoto) are raced around kart tracks. A typical minimoto is approximately one-quarter the size of a regular motorcycle, and is powered by a two-stroke internal combustion engine of between 40–50 cc producing somewhere between 2. 4 and 17 hp (1. 8 and 11 kW).  The machines have no suspension, relying on the tires to absorb bumps and handle cornering, and weigh approximately  .  The entry-level models produce about 2. 4–4. 2 hp, but the more expensive racing models can have a power output of about 11–17 hp. 

Production Bike Racing<====>23860<====>Production Bike Racing Production Bike Racing is a form of Motorcycle racing that involves racing motorcycles virtually unmodified from those that can be bought in shops and then ridden on public highways. The most common subcategory is the 250 cc production bike class, in which "race-replica" motorcycles that superficially resemble Grand Prix machines but have engines capable of meeting legal and reliability requirements for street use, have their road equipment ripped off and are raced. Because each bike offers virtually identical performance, and because they are relatively cheap to buy and race, it is a popular introductory racing category, particularly in Australia. 

Python (programming language)<====>23862<====>Python (programming language) Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming.  Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code,notably using significant whitespace.  It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.  Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.  It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library. 

Pyridine<====>23863<====>Pyridine  Pyridine is a basic heterocyclic organic compound with the chemical formula C 5 H 5 N.  It is structurally related to benzene, with one methine group (=CH−) replaced by a nitrogen atom.  The pyridine ring occurs in many important compounds, including azines and the vitamins niacin and pyridoxine. Pyridine was discovered in 1849 by the Scottish chemist Thomas Anderson as one of the constituents of bone oil.  Two years later, Anderson isolated pure pyridine through fractional distillation of the oil.  It is a colorless, highly flammable, weakly alkaline, water-soluble liquid with a distinctive, unpleasant fish-like smell. 

Production car racing<====>23864<====>Production car racing Production car racing, showroom stock racing, street Stock,  pure stock, and U-car racing are all categories of auto racing where unmodified (or very lightly modified) cars race each other, outright and also in classes.   Cars usually have a protective roll cage and run race tires (either slicks or radials).   Some freedoms are allowed, like gearbox coolers, giving the cars increased performance and components longevity.  Production car racing, known in the US as "showroom stock", is an economical and rules restricted version of touring car racing. Many production racing categories are based on particular makes of cars. 

Phenols<====>23865<====>Phenols In organic chemistry, phenols, sometimes called phenolics, are a class of chemical compounds consisting of a hydroxyl group (—OH) bonded directly to an aromatic hydrocarbon group.  The simplest of the class is phenol, which is also called carbolic acid  .   Phenolic compounds are classified as simple phenols or polyphenols based on the number of phenol units in the molecule.Synonyms are arenols  or aryl alcohols.  Phenolic compounds are synthesized industrially; they also are produced by plants and microorganisms, with variation between and within species. 

Pompey<====>23867<====>PompeyGnaeus Pompeius Magnus  ( ; 29 September 106 BC – 28 September 48 BC),  usually known in English as Pompey   or Pompey the Great,  was a military and political leader of the late Roman Republic.  He came from a wealthy Italian provincial background, and his father had been the first to establish the family among the Roman nobility.  Pompey's immense success as a general while still very young enabled him to advance directly to his first consulship without meeting the normal requirements for office.  His success as a military commander in Sulla's second civil war resulted in Sulla bestowing the nickname Magnus, "the Great", upon him. 

Pasta<====>23871<====>Pasta    Pasta ( ) is a staple food  of traditional Italian cuisine, with the first reference dating to 1154 in Sicily.  Also commonly used to refer to the variety of pasta dishes, pasta is typically a noodle made from an unleavened dough of a durum wheat flour mixed with water or eggs and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking.  As an alternative for those wanting a different taste, or who need to avoid products containing gluten, some pastas can be made using rice flour in place of wheat. 

Polymerization<====>23872<====>Polymerization In polymer chemistry, polymerization is a process of reacting monomer molecules together in a chemical reaction to form  polymer chains or three-dimensional networks.

Phoenix (TV series)<====>23875<====>Phoenix (TV series)Phoenix is an Australian police drama television series.  Phoenix screened as two thirteen-part series on Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 1992 and 1993. The first series of Phoenix in 1992 recounted the investigation of the bombing of the Victorian state police headquarters, loosely based on a real case in the mid-1980s, the Russell Street Bombing.  It was aided by extensive research into police techniques and was lauded as one of the most realistic depictions of police investigation techniques, including both surveillance and forensics, as well as having an involving storyline. The series was notable for its dark visual tone and for its no-holds-barred attitude to violence and language. 

Penguin<====>23878<====>Penguin    Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are a group of aquatic, flightless birds.   They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Galapagos penguin, found north of the equator.  Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and their wings have evolved into flippers.  Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life caught while swimming underwater.  They spend about half of their lives on land and half in the oceans. Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. 

Psycho (1960 film)<====>23880<====>Psycho (1960 film)   Psycho is a 1960 American psychological horror film   directed and produced by Alfred Hitchcock, and written by Joseph Stefano, starring Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, John Gavin, Vera Miles and Martin Balsam, and was based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch.  The film centers on the encounter between a secretary, Marion Crane (Leigh), who ends up at a secluded motel after stealing money from her employer, and the motel's disturbed owner-manager, Norman Bates (Perkins), and its aftermath.  Psycho was seen as a departure from Hitchcock's previous film North by Northwest, having been filmed on a low budget, with a television crew and in black and white. 

Protocol stack<====>23882<====>Protocol stackThe protocol stack or network stack is an implementation of a computer networking protocol suite or protocol family.   The terms are often used interchangeably;  strictly speaking, the suite is the definition of the Communications protocols, and the stack is the software implementation of them.  Individual protocols within a suite are often designed with a single purpose in mind.  This modularization makes design and evaluation easier.  Because each protocol module usually communicates with two others, they are commonly imagined as layers in a stack of protocols.  The lowest protocol always deals with low-level interaction with the communications hardware. 

Pilsner<====>23884<====>Pilsner Pilsner (also pilsener or simply pils) is a type of pale lager.  It takes its name from the Bohemian city of Pilsen, where it was first produced in 1842.   The world’s first blond lager, the original Pilsner Urquell,  is still produced there today. HistoryOriginThe city of Pilsen began brewing in 1295, but until the mid-1840s, most Bohemian beers were top-fermented.  The taste and standards of quality often varied widely, and in 1838, consumers dumped whole barrels to show their dissatisfaction.   The officials of Pilsen founded a city-owned brewery in 1839, called Měšťanský pivovar Plzeň ( ,   - now Pilsner Urquell), which was to brew beer in the pioneering Bavarian style. 

Phlogiston theory<====>23886<====>Phlogiston theoryThe phlogiston theory is a superseded scientific theory that postulated that a fire-like element called phlogiston is contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion.  The name comes from the Ancient Greek   phlogistón (burning up), from   phlóx (flame).  It was first stated in 1667 by Johann Joachim Becher, and then put together more formally by Georg Ernst Stahl.   The theory attempted to explain processes such as combustion and rusting, which are now collectively known as oxidation. The theoryPhlogiston theory states that phlogisticated substances are substances that contain phlogiston and dephlogisticate when burned. 

Poltergeist<====>23888<====>Poltergeist   In folklore and parapsychology, a 'poltergeist' (German for "noisy ghost" or "noisy spirit") is a type of ghost or spirit that is responsible for physical disturbances, such as loud noises and objects being moved or destroyed.  They are purportedly capable of pinching, biting, hitting, and tripping people.  Most accounts of poltergeists describe the movement or levitation of objects such as furniture and cutlery, or noises such as knocking on doors. They have traditionally been described as troublesome spirits who haunt a particular person instead of a specific location.  Such alleged poltergeist manifestations have been reported in many cultures and countries including the United States, India‚ Japan, Brazil, Australia, and most European nations. 

Pulley<====>23889<====>Pulley  A pulley is a wheel on an axle or shaft that is designed to support movement and change of direction of a taut cable or belt, or transfer of power between the shaft and cable or belt.  In the case of a pulley supported by a frame or shell which does not transfer power to a shaft, but is used to guide the cable or exert a force, the supporting shell is called a block, and the pulley may be called a sheave. A pulley may have a groove or grooves between flanges around its circumference to locate the cable or belt. 

Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty<====>23890<====>Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic TreatyThe Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, also known as the Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, or the Madrid Protocol, is part of the Antarctic Treaty System.

The treaty will be open for review in 2048. Key Articles of the TreatyArticle 3 states that protection of the Antarctic environment as a wilderness with aesthetic and scientific value shall be a "fundamental consideration" of activities in the area. 

Particle radiation<====>23891<====>Particle radiation  Particle radiation is the radiation of energy by means of fast-moving subatomic particles.  Particle radiation is referred to as a particle beam if the particles are all moving in the same direction, similar to a light beam. Due to the wave–particle duality, all moving particles also have wave character.  Higher energy particles more easily exhibit particle characteristics, while lower energy particles more easily exhibit wave characteristics. Types and productionParticles can be electrically charged or uncharged:Particle radiation can be emitted by an unstable atomic nucleus (via radioactive decay), or it can be the product from some other kind of nuclear reaction. 

Per capita income<====>23893<====>Per capita income Per capita income or average income measures the average income earned per person in a given area (city, region, country, etc. ) in a specified year.  It is calculated by dividing the area's total income by its total population.   As a measure of prosperityPer capita income is national income/total population. Per capita income is often used to measure an area's average income.  This is used to see the wealth of the population with those of others.  Per capita income is often used to measure a country's standard of living.  It is usually expressed in terms of a commonly used international currency such as the euro or United States dollar, and is useful because it is widely known, is easily calculable from readily available gross domestic product (GDP) and population estimates, and produces a useful statistic for comparison of wealth between sovereign territories. 

Purus River<====>23895<====>Purus River  The Purus River or Rio Purús is a tributary of the Amazon River in South America.  Its drainage basin is  , and the mean discharge is 8,400 m³/s.  The river shares its name with the Alto Purús National Park as well as the Purús Province (and its conformed Purús District), one of the four provinces of Peru in the Ucayali Region. GeographyThe Purus River rises in Peru. It defines the boundary between Peru and Brazil in the centre of the state of Acre, then runs for a short distance along the boundary of the   Santa Rosa do Purus National Forest, a sustainable use conservation unit created in 2001 after it is joined by the Santa Rosa River.

Polytope compound<====>23901<====>Polytope compoundA polyhedral compound is a figure that is composed of several polyhedra sharing a common centre.   They are the three-dimensional analogs of polygonal compounds such as the hexagram. The outer vertices of a compound can be connected to form a convex polyhedron called the convex hull.  The compound is a facetting of the convex hull. Another convex polyhedron is formed by the small central space common to all members of the compound.  This polyhedron can be used as the core for a set of stellations. Regular compoundsA regular polyhedron compound can be defined as a compound which, like a regular polyhedron, is vertex-transitive, edge-transitive, and face-transitive. 

Platonic solid<====>23905<====>Platonic solidIn three-dimensional space, a Platonic solid is a regular, convex polyhedron.  It is constructed by congruent (identical in shape and size) regular (all angles equal and all sides equal) polygonal faces with the same number of faces meeting at each vertex.

Peterborough<====>23906<====>Peterborough   {{Infobox settlement }}Peterborough ( ) is a cathedral city in Cambridgeshire, England, with a population of 183,631 in 2011.Historically part of Northamptonshire, it is    north of London, on the River Nene which flows into the North Sea   to the north-east.  The railway station is an important stop on the East Coast Main Line between London and Edinburgh. The local topography is flat and in some places lies below sea level, for example in the Fens that lie to the east of Peterborough.  Human settlement in the area began before the Bronze Age, as can be seen at the Flag Fen archaeological site to the east of the current city centre, also with evidence of Roman occupation. 

Polyphemus<====>23914<====>Polyphemus   Polyphemus ( ;   Polyphēmos) is the giant son of Poseidon and Thoosa in Greek mythology, one of the Cyclopes described in Homer's Odyssey.  His name means "abounding in songs and legends".   Polyphemus first appears as a savage man-eating giant in the ninth book of the Odyssey.  Some later Classical writers link his name with the nymph Galatea and present him in a different light. Odysseus and PolyphemusThe Classical accountsIn Homer's epic, Odysseus lands on the island of the Cyclops during his journey home from the Trojan War and, together with some of his men, enters a cave filled with provisions. 

Portuguese language<====>23915<====>Portuguese language  Portuguese (  or, in full,  ) is a western Romance language and the sole official language of Portugal, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Angola, and São Tomé and Príncipe.It also has co-official language status in East Timor, Equatorial Guinea and Macau in China.  As the result of expansion during colonial times, a cultural presence of Portuguese and Portuguese creole speakers are also found in Goa, Daman and Diu in India;  in Batticaloa on the east coast of Sri Lanka; in the Indonesian island of Flores; in the Malacca state of Malaysia; and the ABC islands in the Caribbean where Papiamento is spoken, while Cape Verdean Creole is the most widely spoken Portuguese-based Creole. 

Paul Reubens<====>23916<====>Paul ReubensPaul Reubens (born Paul Rubenfeld; August 27, 1952)    is an American actor, writer, film producer, game show host, and comedian, best known for his character Pee-wee Herman.  Reubens joined the Los Angeles troupe The Groundlings in the 1970s and started his career as an improvisational comedian and stage actor.  In 1982, Reubens put up a show about a character he had been developing for years.  The show was called The Pee-wee Herman Show and it ran for five sold-out months with HBO producing a successful special about it. 

Prismatoid<====>23917<====>PrismatoidIn geometry, a prismatoid is a polyhedron whose vertices all lie in two parallel planes. Its lateral faces can be trapezoids or triangles.  If both planes have the same number of vertices, and the lateral faces are either parallelograms or trapezoids, it is called a prismoid.AreaIf the areas of the two parallel faces are A 1  and A 3 , the cross-sectional area of the intersection of the prismatoid with a plane midway between the two parallel faces is A 2 , and the height (the distance between the two parallel faces) is h, then the volume of the prismatoid is given by  V = \frac{h(A_1 + 4A_2 + A_3)}{6}  or  V = \frac{nh(a^2+4b^2+c^2)}{24\tan (180/n)} (This formula follows immediately by integrating the area parallel to the two planes of vertices by Simpson's rule, since that rule is exact for integration of polynomials of degree up to 3, and in this case the area is at most a quadratic function in the height.)Prismatoid familiesPyramids Wedges Parallelepipeds Prisms Antiprisms Cupolae FrustaFamilies of prismatoids include:Pyramids, in which one plane contains only a single point;Wedges, in which one plane contains only two points;Prisms, whose polygons in each plane are congruent and joined by rectangles or parallelograms;Antiprisms, whose polygons in each plane are congruent and joined by an alternating strip of triangles;Crossed antiprisms;Cupolae, in which the polygon in one plane contains twice as many points as the other and is joined to it by alternating triangles and rectangles;Frusta obtained by truncation of a pyramid;Quadrilateral-faced hexahedral prismatoids:Parallelepipeds – six parallelogram facesRhombohedrons – six rhombus facesTrigonal trapezohedra – six congruent rhombus facesCuboids – six rectangular facesQuadrilateral frusta – an apex-truncated square pyramidCube – six square facesHigher dimensionsIn general, a polytope is prismatoidal if its vertices exist in two hyperplanes. For example, in four dimensions, two polyhedra can be placed in two parallel 3-spaces, and connected with polyhedral sides. A tetrahedral-cuboctahedral cupola.References External links   

Phantom kangaroo<====>23920<====>Phantom kangaroo   A Phantom kangaroo is a report of kangaroos, wallabies, or their accompanying footprints in areas where there is no native population.Some explanations put forth are escaped zoo or circus animals (as in the UK), or publicity stunts by local businesses using photographs from Australia.  Others suggest outbreaks of such sightings are a form of mass hysteria. FranceIt is sometimes said there is a population of kangaroos living in the wild in the township of Émancé, about 50 km south-west of Paris.   In fact, they are red-necked wallabies.   These wallabies are descended from a breeding population which escaped a zoological reserve in the 1970s. 

Princeton University<====>23922<====>Princeton UniversityPrinceton University  is a private Ivy League research university in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.  Founded in 1746 in Elizabeth as the   College of New Jersey, Princeton is the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.    The institution moved to Newark in 1747, then to the current site nine years later, where it was renamed Princeton University in 1896.  Princeton provides undergraduate and graduate instruction in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and engineering. 

Posthumous execution<====>23923<====>Posthumous executionPosthumous execution is the ritual or ceremonial mutilation of an already dead body as a punishment.   It is typically performed to show that even in death, one cannot escape justice. Dissection as a punishment in EnglandSome Christians believed that the resurrection of the dead on judgement day requires that the body be buried whole facing east so that the body could rise facing God.    If dismemberment stopped the possibility of the resurrection of an intact body, then a posthumous execution was an effective way of punishing a criminal.    Examples Li Linfu, Chancellor of Tang China for 18 years (734–752) during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong (712–756), was stripped of many of his funerary regalia before his funeral could take place, and was instead buried in a commoner's coffin as punishment for crimes of high treason. 

Passenger pigeon<====>23924<====>Passenger pigeon   The passenger pigeon or wild pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) is an extinct species of pigeon that was endemic to North America.  Its common name is derived from the French word passager, meaning "passing by", due to the migratory habits of the species.  The scientific name also refers to its migratory characteristics.  The morphologically similar mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) was long thought to be its closest relative, and the two were at times confused, but genetic analysis has shown that the genus Patagioenas is more closely related to it than the Zenaida doves. The passenger pigeon was sexually dimorphic in size and coloration.

Palace<====>23931<====>Palace  A palace is a grand residence, especially a royal residence, or the home of a head of state or some other high-ranking dignitary, such as a bishop or archbishop.    The word is derived from the Latin name Palātium, for Palatine Hill in Rome which housed the Imperial residences.   In many parts of Europe, the term is also applied to ambitious private mansions of the aristocracy.  Many historic palaces are now put to other uses such as parliaments, museums, hotels, or office buildings.  The word is also sometimes used to describe a lavishly ornate building used for public entertainment or exhibitions. 

Patrick White<====>23932<====>Patrick WhitePatrick Victor Martindale White (28 May 1912 30 September 1990) was an Australian writer who is widely regarded as one of the most important English-language novelists of the 20th century.  From 1935 to 1987, he published 12 novels, three short-story collections and eight plays. White's fiction employs humour, florid prose, shifting narrative vantage points and a stream of consciousness technique.  In 1973, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature,  "for an epic and psychological narrative art which has introduced a new continent into literature", as it says in the Swedish Academy's citation,  the first Australian to have been awarded the prize. 

Pope Martin I<====>23933<====>Pope Martin I  Pope Martin I ( ; born between 590 and 600, died 16 September 655) reigned from 21 July 649 to his death in 655.  Mershman, Francis (1910).  "Pope St.  Martin I" in The Catholic Encyclopedia.  Vol.  9.  New York: Robert Appleton Company.   He succeeded Pope Theodore I on 5 July 649.  He was the only pope during the Byzantine Papacy whose election was not approved by a iussio from Constantinople.  Martin I was exiled by Emperor Constans II and died at Cherson.  He is considered a saint and martyr by the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. 

Pope Martin IV<====>23936<====>Pope Martin IV    Pope Martin IV, ( ; c.  1210/1220 – 28 March 1285), born Simon  de Brion, was Pope from 22 February 1281  to his death in 1285.  He was the last French pope to have held court in Rome; all subsequent French popes held court in Avignon (the Avignon Papacy). Early lifeSimon de Brion, son of Jean, sieur de Brion, was born at the château of Meinpincien,  Île-de-France, France, in the decade following 1210.  He had a brother named Gilo, who was a knight in diocese of Sens.    The seigneurial family of Brion, who took their name from Brion near Joigny, flourished in the Brie français. 

Pope Martin V<====>23937<====>Pope Martin V  Pope Martin V ( ; January/February 1369 – 20 February 1431), born Otto (or Oddone) Colonna, was Pope from 11 November 1417 to his death in 1431.   His election effectively ended the Western Schism (1378–1417). BiographyHe was born at Genazzano, the son of Agapito Colonna and Caterina Conti, between January 26 and February 20, 1369.  His date of birth can be established basing on the following contemporary reports:In the document issued on January 25, 1391 by Pope Boniface IX he is reported as being in the 22nd year of his life, see MARTINO V, papa. 

Perl<====>23939<====>PerlPerl is a family of high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages.  The languages in this family include Perl 5 and Perl 6.  Though Perl is not officially an acronym,  there are various backronyms in use, including "Practical Extraction and Reporting Language".   Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier.Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions.  Perl 6, which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000, eventually evolved into a separate language. 

Proto-Human language<====>23940<====>Proto-Human languageThe Proto-Human language (also Proto-Sapiens, Proto-World) is the speculative most recent common ancestor of all, or at least the large majority of, the world's languages. The concept of "Proto-Human" presupposes monogenesis (evolution from a common ancestor) of all natural languages apart from pidgins, creoles, and sign languages.  It does not presuppose a common ancestor of these languages with all extinct lineages, whether human or possible Neanderthal languages. TerminologyThere is no generally accepted term for this concept.  Most treatments of the subject do not include a name for the language under consideration (e. g.  Bengtson and Ruhlen 1994).

Palestinian Christians<====>23949<====>Palestinian Christians   Palestinian Christians ( ) are Christian citizens of the State of Palestine.  In the wider definition of Palestinian Christians, including the Palestinian refugees, diaspora and people with full or partial Palestinian Christian ancestry this can be applied to an estimated 500,000 people worldwide as of the year 2000.   Palestinian Christians belong to one of a number of Christian denominations, including Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, Catholicism (Eastern and Western rites), Anglicanism, Lutheranism, other branches of Protestantism and others.  They number 6–7% of the 12 million Palestinians.  70% live outside Palestine and Israel. 

Pope Marinus I<====>23956<====>Pope Marinus I   Pope Marinus I (or Martin II; died 15 May 884) was Pope from 16 December 882 to his death in 884.  He succeeded John VIII in about the end of December 882.    Prior historyBorn at Gallese, Marinus was the son of a priest.  He was ordained as a deacon by Pope Nicholas I.Before his election as Pope, he served as Bishop of Caere, which made his election controversial, because, at this stage of history, a bishop was expected never to leave office to move to another see. 

Pope Marinus II<====>23957<====>Pope Marinus II  Pope Marinus II (or Martin III; d.  May 946), was Pope from 30 October 942 to his death in 946. PontificateMarinus was born in Rome, and prior to becoming pope he was attached to the Church of Saint Cyriacus in the Baths of Diocletian.  He was said to have encountered St.  Ulrich on his visit to Rome in 909, and reportedly predicted Ulrich’s eventual appointment as Bishop of Augsburg.  Marinus was elevated to the papacy on 30 October 942 through intervention of Alberic II of Spoleto, Prince of the Romans.  He concentrated on administrative aspects of the papacy, and sought to reform both the secular and regular clergy. 

Pope Marcellus I<====>23958<====>Pope Marcellus I  Pope Marcellus I (died 309) was the Bishop of Rome or Pope from May or June 308 to his death in 309.  He succeeded Pope Marcellinus after a considerable interval.  Under Maxentius, he was banished from Rome in 309, on account of the tumult caused by the severity of the penances he had imposed on Christians who had lapsed under the recent persecution.  He died the same year, being succeeded by Pope Eusebius.His relics are under the altar of San Marcello al Corso in Rome.  His third-class feast day is kept on January 16. 

Pope Marcellus II<====>23959<====>Pope Marcellus II    Pope Marcellus II (6 May 1501 – 1 May 1555), born Marcello Cervini degli Spannochi,was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 9 April 1555    until his death 22 days later on 1 May 1555. He succeeded Pope Julius III.  Before his accession as pope he had been Cardinal-Priest of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme.  He is the most recent pope to choose to retain his birth name as his regnal name upon his accession, as well as only the second and most recent pope to date to take the name "Marcellus" upon being elected. 

Pope Miltiades<====>23960<====>Pope Miltiades   Pope Saint Miltiades ( , Miltiádēs; d.  10 January 314), also known as Melchiades the African (  Melkhiádēs ho Aphrikanós), was the 32nd Pope of the Catholic Church from 311 to his death in 314.  It was during his pontificate that Emperor Constantine I issued the Edict of Milan (313), giving Christianity legal status within the Roman Empire.  The Pope also received the palace of Empress Fausta where the Lateran Palace, the papal seat and residence of the papal administration, would be built.  At the Lateran Council, during the schism with the Church of Carthage, Miltiades condemned the rebaptism of apostatised bishops and priests, a teaching of Donatus Magnus. 

Phylogeny<====>23961<====>Phylogeny

Phylogenetics<====>23962<====>Phylogenetics  In biology, phylogenetics(Greek: φυλή, φῦλον - phylé, phylon = tribe, clan, race + γενετικός - genetikós = origin, source, birth)  is the study of the evolutionary history and relationships among individuals or groups of organisms (e. g.  species, or  populations).  These relationships are discovered through phylogenetic inference methods that evaluate observed heritable traits, such as DNA sequences or morphology under a model of evolution of these traits.  The result of these analyses is a phylogeny (also known as a phylogenetic tree) – a diagrammatic hypothesis about the history of the evolutionary relationships of a group of organisms. 

Phenetics<====>23963<====>Phenetics  In biology, phenetics (  - to appear)  , also known as taximetrics, is an attempt to classify organisms based on overall similarity, usually in morphology or other observable traits, regardless of their phylogeny or evolutionary relation.  It is closely related to numerical taxonomy which is concerned with the use of numerical methods for taxonomic classification.  Many people contributed to the development of phenetics, but the most influential were Peter Sneath and Robert R.  Sokal.  Their books are still primary references for this sub-discipline, although now out of print.  Phenetics has largely been superseded by cladistics for research into evolutionary relationships among species. 

PlayStation (console)<====>23964<====>PlayStation (console)The PlayStation  (officially abbreviated to PS, and commonly known as the PS1 or PSX) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment.  The console was released on 3 December   in Japan,    9 September 1995 in North America, 29 September 1995 in Europe, and for 15 November 1995 in Australia.  The console was the first of the PlayStation lineup of home video game consoles.  It primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn as part of the fifth generation of video game consoles. 

PDP-1<====>23965<====>PDP-1The PDP-1 (Programmed Data Processor-1) is the first computer in Digital Equipment Corporation's PDP series and was first produced in 1959.  It is famous for being the computer most important in the creation of hacker culture at MIT, BBN and elsewhere.   The PDP-1 is the original hardware for playing history's first game on a minicomputer, Steve Russell's Spacewar!.    DescriptionThe PDP-1 uses an 18-bit word size and has 4096 words as standard main memory (equivalent to 9,216 eight-bit bytes, though the system actually uses six-bit bytes), upgradable to   words.  The magnetic core memory's cycle time is 5. 

Pilus<====>23971<====>Pilus A pilus (Latin for 'hair'; plural : pili) is a hair-like appendage found on the surface of many bacteria.    The terms pilus and fimbria (Latin for 'fringe'; plural: fimbriae) can be used interchangeably, although some researchers reserve the term pilus for the appendage required for bacterial conjugation.   All pili in the latter sense are primarily composed of pilin proteins, which are oligomeric. Dozens of these structures can exist on the bacteria.  Some bacterial viruses or bacteriophages attach to receptors on pili at the start of their reproductive cycle. Pili are antigenic.  They are also fragile and constantly replaced, sometimes with pili of different composition, resulting in altered antigenicity. 

Porsche 928<====>23972<====>Porsche 928  The Porsche 928 is a luxury grand tourer produced by Porsche AG of Germany from 1978 to 1995.  Originally intended to replace the company's iconic 911, the 928 combined the power, poise, and handling of a sports car with the refinement, comfort, and equipment of a luxury sedan.  Porsche executives believed such a flagship would have wider appeal than the compact, quirky and sometimes difficult 911. The 928 has the distinction of being the company's first production V8 powered model and only coupé powered by a front-mounted V8 engine. Conception By the late 1960s Porsche had firmly established itself as a manufacturer of high-performance sports cars. 

Plasmid<====>23974<====>Plasmid A plasmid is a small  DNA molecule within a cell that is physically separated from a chromosomal DNA and can replicate independently.  They are most commonly found as small circular, double-stranded DNA molecules in bacteria; however, plasmids are sometimes present in archaea and eukaryotic organisms.  In nature, plasmids often carry genes that may benefit the survival of the organism, for example antibiotic resistance.  While the chromosomes are big and contain all the essential genetic information for living under normal conditions, plasmids usually are very small and contain only additional genes that may be useful to the organism under certain situations or particular conditions. 

Parallelepiped<====>23975<====>ParallelepipedParallelepiped  Type Prism Plesiohedron Faces 6 parallelograms Edges 12 Vertices 8 Symmetry group C i , [2 + ,2 + ], (×), order 2 Properties convex, zonohedron In geometry, a parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure formed by six parallelograms (the term rhomboid is also sometimes used with this meaning).  By analogy, it relates to a parallelogram just as a cube relates to a square or as a cuboid to a rectangle.  In Euclidean geometry, its definition encompasses all four concepts (i. e. , parallelepiped, parallelogram, cube, and  square).  In this context of affine geometry, in which angles are not differentiated, its definition admits only parallelograms and parallelepipeds. 

Plant cell<====>23977<====>Plant cell    Plant cells are  eukaryotic cells that differ in several key aspects from the cells of other eukaryotic organisms.  These distinctive features include the following:A large central vacuole, a water-filled volume enclosed by a membrane known as the tonoplast    that maintains the cell's turgor, controls movement of molecules between the cytosol and sap, stores useful material and digests waste proteins and organelles. A cell wall composed of cellulose and hemicelluloses, pectin and in many cases lignin, is secreted by the protoplast on the outside of the cell membrane.  This contrasts with the cell walls of fungi, which are made of chitin, and of bacteria, which are made of peptidoglycan. 

Polysaccharide<====>23978<====>PolysaccharidePolysaccharides are polymeric carbohydrate molecules composed of long chains of monosaccharide units bound together by glycosidic linkages, and on hydrolysis give the constituent monosaccharides or oligosaccharides.  They range in structure from linear to highly branched.  Examples include storage polysaccharides such as starch and glycogen, and structural polysaccharides such as cellulose and chitin. Polysaccharides are often quite heterogeneous, containing slight modifications of the repeating unit.  Depending on the structure, these macromolecules can have distinct properties from their monosaccharide building blocks.  They may be amorphous or even insoluble in water.When all the monosaccharides in a polysaccharide are the same type, the polysaccharide is called a homopolysaccharide or homoglycan, but when more than one type of monosaccharide is present they are called heteropolysaccharides or heteroglycans. 

Ptolemy<====>23979<====>Ptolemy    Claudius Ptolemy ( ;  , Klaúdios Ptolemaîos  ;  ;    )  was a Greco-Roman  mathematician, astronomer, geographer, astrologer, and poet of a single epigram in the Greek Anthology.    He lived in the city of Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt, wrote in Koine Greek, and held Roman citizenship.   The 14th-century astronomer Theodore Meliteniotes gave his birthplace as the prominent Greek city Ptolemais Hermiou ( ) in the Thebaid ( ).  This attestation is quite late, however, and, according to Gerald Toomer, the translator of his Almagest into English, there is no reason to suppose he ever lived anywhere other than Alexandria. 

Petabyte<====>23980<====>Petabyte    The petabyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information.  The prefix peta indicates the fifth power of 1000 and means 10 15  in the International System of Units (SI), and therefore 1 petabyte is one quadrillion (short scale) bytes, or 1 billiard (long scale) bytes.  The unit symbol for the petabyte is PB. 1 PB =   =   =  . A related unit, the pebibyte (PiB), using a binary prefix, is equal to 1024 5  bytes, which is more than 12% greater (2 50  bytes =  ). 

Pyxis<====>23984<====>Pyxis   Pyxis ( ; Latin for a small medicinal box) is a small and faint constellation in the southern sky.  Abbreviated from Pyxis Nautica, its name is Latin for a mariner's compass (contrasting with Circinus, which represents a draftsman's compasses).  Pyxis was introduced by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century, and is counted among the 88 modern constellations.  The constellation is located close to those forming the old constellation of the ship Argo Navis, and in the 19th century astronomer John Herschel suggested renaming Pyxis to Malus, the mast, but the suggestion was not followed. 

Parasitic computing<====>23985<====>Parasitic computing Parasitic computing is programming technique where a program in normal authorized interactions with another program manages to get the other program to perform computations of a complex nature.  It is, in a sense, a security exploit in that the program implementing the parasitic computing has no authority to consume resources made available to the other program. It was first proposed by Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, Vincent W.  Freeh, Hawoong Jeong & Jay B.  Brockman from University of Notre Dame, Indiana, USA, in 2001.   The example given by the original paper was two computers communicating over the Internet, under disguise of a standard communications session. 

Pegasus<====>23986<====>Pegasus   Pegasus ( , Pḗgasos;  ) is a mythical winged divine stallion, and one of the most recognised creatures in Greek mythology.  Usually depicted as pure white in color, Pegasus was a child of the Olympian god Poseidon, in his role as horse-god, and foaled by the Gorgon Medusa  upon her death, when the hero Perseus decapitated her.  Pegasus was also the brother of Chrysaor and the uncle of Geryon.  Greco-Roman poets wrote about the ascent of Pegasus to heaven after his birth, and his subsequent obeisance to Zeus, king of the gods, who instructed him to bring lightning and thunder from Olympus. 

Party-list proportional representation<====>23987<====>Party-list proportional representationParty-list proportional representation systems are a family of voting systems emphasizing proportional representation (PR) in elections in which multiple candidates are elected (e. g. , elections to parliament) through allocations to an electoral list.  They can also be used as part of mixed additional member systems.  In these systems, parties make lists of candidates to be elected, and seats get distributed to each party in proportion to the number of votes the party receives.  Voters may vote directly for the party, as in Albania, Argentina, Turkey, and Israel; or for candidates whose vote total will pool to the party, as in Finland, Brazil and the Netherlands; or for a list of candidates, as in Hong Kong. 

Puppis<====>23990<====>Puppis Puppis   is a constellation in the southern sky.   Puppis, the Poop Deck, was originally part of an over-large constellation, the ship of "Jason and the Argonauts", Argo Navis, which centuries after its initial description was divided into three parts, the other two being Carina (the keel and hull), and Vela (the sails of the ship).  Puppis is the largest of the three constellations in square degrees.  It is one of the 88 modern constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union. FeaturesArgo Navis was sub-divided into three sections 1752 by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille, including "Argûs in puppi". 

Piscis Austrinus<====>23992<====>Piscis Austrinus Piscis Austrinus is a constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere.  The name is Latin for "the southern fish", in contrast with the larger constellation Pisces, which represents a pair of fishes.  Prior to the 20th century, it was also known as Piscis Notius.  Its only star brighter than fourth magnitude is Fomalhaut, which is a first-magnitude star and is the eighteenth-brightest star in the night sky. Piscis Austrinus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.  The stars of the modern constellation Grus once formed the "tail" of Piscis Austrinus. 

Ptolemaic dynasty<====>23994<====>Ptolemaic dynasty   The Ptolemaic dynasty   ( , Ptolemaioi), sometimes also known as the Lagids   or Lagidae   ( , Lagidai, after Lagus, Ptolemy I's father), was a Macedonian Greek royal family, which ruled the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt during the Hellenistic period.  Their rule lasted for 275 years, from 305 to 30 BC.   They were the last dynasty of ancient Egypt. Ptolemy, one of the seven somatophylakes (bodyguards) who served as Alexander the Great's generals and deputies, was appointed satrap of Egypt after Alexander's death in 323 BC.

Political party<====>23996<====>Political partyA political party is a group of people who come together to contest elections and hold power in the government.  The party agrees on some proposed policies and programmes, with a view to promoting the collective good or furthering their supporters' interests. While there is some  international commonality in the way political parties are recognized, and in how they operate, there are often many differences, and some are significant.  Many political parties have an ideological core, but some do not, and many represent ideologies very different from their ideology at the time the party was founded.

Paraffin wax<====>24006<====>Paraffin wax Paraffin wax is a white or colourless soft solid derivable from petroleum, coal or oil shale, that consists of a mixture of hydrocarbon molecules containing between twenty and forty carbon atoms.  It is solid at room temperature and begins to melt above approximately  ;  its boiling point is > .   Common applications for paraffin wax include lubrication, electrical insulation, and candles;  dyed paraffin wax can be made into crayons.  It is distinct from kerosene, another petroleum product that is sometimes called paraffin. Un-dyed, unscented, paraffin candles are odorless, and bluish-white in color. 

Pearl<====>24007<====>Pearl  A pearl is a hard glistening object produced within the soft tissue (specifically the mantle) of a living shelled mollusk or another animal, such as a conulariid.  Just like the shell of a mollusk, a pearl is composed of calcium carbonate (mainly aragonite or a mixture of aragonite and calcite)  in minute crystalline form, which has been deposited in concentric layers.  The ideal pearl is perfectly round and smooth, but many other shapes, known as baroque pearls, can occur.  The finest quality natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones and objects of beauty for many centuries. 

Pope Benedict I<====>24008<====>Pope Benedict I   Pope Benedict I ( ; d.  30 July 579) was Pope from 2 June 575 to his death in 579.    LifeBenedict was the son of a man named Bonifacius, and was called Bonosus by the Greeks.  The ravages of the Lombards rendered it very difficult to communicate with the Byzantine Emperor at Constantinople, who claimed the privilege of confirming the election of the popes.  Hence there was a vacancy of nearly eleven months between the death of Pope John III and the arrival of the imperial confirmation of Benedict's election on 2 June 575.

Aged approximately 20 at his first election, he is one of the youngest popes in history.  He is the only man to have been Pope on more than one occasion and the only man ever to have sold the papacy. Benedict was the nephew of his immediate predecessor, Pope John XIX.  In October 1032, his father obtained his election through bribery.  However, his reputed dissolute activities provoked a revolt on the part of the Romans. 

Pope Benedict XI<====>24017<====>Pope Benedict XI    Pope Benedict XI ( ; 1240 – 7 July 1304), born Nicola Boccasini, (Niccolò of Treviso) was Pope from 22 October 1303 to his death on 7 July, 1304.

He was the third Avignon Pope.  Benedict was a careful pope who reformed monastic orders and opposed nepotism.  Unable to remove his capital to Rome or Bologna, he started the great palace at Avignon.  He decided against a notion of Pope John XXII by saying that souls may attain the "fulness of the beatific vision" before the last judgment.   He tried unsuccessfully to reunite the Greek and Roman churches. 

Pope Benedict XIII<====>24019<====>Pope Benedict XIII    Pope Benedict XIII ( ; 2 February 1649 – 21 February 1730), born Pietro Francesco Orsini, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 29 May 1724 to his death in 1730.   A Dominican friar, Orsini focused on his religious responsibilities as bishop rather than on papal administration.  Orsini's lack of political expertise led him to increasingly rely on an unscrupulous secretary (Cardinal Niccolò Coscia) whose financial abuses ruined the papal treasury, causing great damage to the Church in Rome. In the process towards sainthood, his cause for canonization opened in 1755, but it was soon closed. 

Pope Benedict XIV<====>24020<====>Pope Benedict XIV Pope Benedict XIV ( ; 31 March 1675 – 3 May 1758), born Prospero Lorenzo Lambertini, served as the Pope of the Catholic Church from 17 August 1740 to his death in 1758.

At the time, however, this status was not recognised and so the pontiff the Catholic Church officially considers the tenth true Pope Benedict took the official number XI, rather than X.  This has advanced the numbering of all subsequent Popes Benedict by one.  Popes Benedict XI-XVI are, from an official point of view, the tenth through fifteenth popes by that name. 

Place of articulation<====>24021<====>Place of articulation In articulatory phonetics, the place of articulation (also point of articulation) of a consonant is the point of contact where an   occurs in the vocal tract between an articulatory gesture, an active articulator (typically some part of the tongue), and a passive location (typically some part of the roof of the mouth).  Along with the manner of articulation and the phonation, it gives the consonant its distinctive sound. The terminology in this article has been developed for precisely describing all the consonants in all the world's spoken languages.  No known language distinguishes all of the places described here so less precision is needed to distinguish the sounds of a particular language. 

Physical therapy<====>24022<====>Physical therapy   Physical therapy (PT), mostly known as Physiotherapy, is one of the primary healthcare professions  and not an allied health profession that, by using mechanical force and movements [Bio-mechanics or Kinesiology], Manual therapy, exercise therapy, and electrotherapy, remediates impairments and promotes mobility and function.   Physical therapy is used to improve a patient's quality of life through assesment, examination, diagnosis, prognosis, and physical intervention and exercise and electro prescription.  It is performed by physical therapists (known as physiotherapists in many countries). In addition to clinical practice, other activities encompassed in the physical therapy profession include research, education, consultation, and administration. 

Polygyny<====>24025<====>Polygyny   Polygyny ( ; from Neoclassical Greek πολυγυνία from πολύ- poly- "many", and γυνή gyne "woman" or "wife" ) is the most common and accepted form of polygamy, entailing the marriage of a man with several women.  Most countries that permit polygamy are Muslim-majority countries in which polygyny is the only form permitted.  Polyandry is illegal in virtually every state of the world. In some countries where polygamy is illegal, and sometimes even when legal, at times it is known for men to have one or more mistresses, whom they do not marry.  The status of a mistress is not that of a wife, and any children born of such relationships were and some still are considered illegitimate and subject to legal disadvantage. 

Proteome<====>24026<====>ProteomeThe proteome is the entire set of proteins expressed by a genome, cell, tissue, or organism at a certain time.  More specifically, it is the set of expressed proteins in a given type of cell or organism, at a given time, under defined conditions.  Proteomics is the study of the proteome. SystemsThe term has been applied to several different types of biological systems.  A cellular proteome is the collection of proteins found in a particular cell type under a particular set of environmental conditions such as exposure to hormone stimulation.  It can also be useful to consider an organism's complete proteome, which can be conceptualized as the complete set of proteins from all of the various cellular proteomes. 

Pope John Paul I<====>24027<====>Pope John Paul I    Pope John Paul I ( ;  ; born Albino Luciani;   ; 17 October 1912 28 September 1978) served as Pope of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City from 26 August 1978 to his sudden death 33 days later.   He was the first pope to have been born in the twentieth century.   His reign is among the shortest in papal history, resulting in the most recent Year of Three Popes, the first to occur since 1605.  John Paul I remains the most recent Italian-born pope, the last in a succession of such popes that started with Clement VII in 1523. 

Pope Paul VI<====>24028<====>Pope Paul VI    Pope Paul VI ( ;  ), born Giovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini  ( ; 26 September 1897 – 6 August 1978), reigned from 21 June 1963 to his death in 1978.   Succeeding John XXIII, he continued the Second Vatican Council which he closed in 1965, implementing its numerous reforms, and fostered improved ecumenical relations with Eastern Orthodox and Protestants, which resulted in many historic meetings and agreements.   Montini served in the Holy See's Secretariat of State from 1922 to 1954.  While in the Secretariat of State, Montini and Domenico Tardini were considered as the closest and most influential advisors of Pope Pius XII, who in 1954 named him Archbishop of Milan, the largest Italian diocese. 

Peptide<====>24029<====>Peptide Peptides (from Gr. : πεπτός, peptós "digested"; derived from πέσσειν, péssein "to digest") are  short chains of amino acid monomers linked by peptide (amide) bonds. The covalent chemical bonds are formed when the carboxyl group of one amino acid reacts with the amino group of another.  The shortest peptides are dipeptides, consisting of 2 amino acids joined by a single peptide bond, followed by tripeptides, tetrapeptides, etc.  A polypeptide is a long, continuous, and unbranched peptide chain.  Hence, peptides fall under the broad chemical classes of biological oligomers and polymers, alongside nucleic acids, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, etc. 

Positron emission tomography<====>24032<====>Positron emission tomography Positron-emission tomography (PET)  is a nuclear medicine functional imaging technique that is used to observe metabolic processes in the body.  The system detects pairs of gamma rays emitted indirectly by a positron-emitting radionuclide (tracer), which is introduced into the body on a biologically active molecule.  Three-dimensional images of tracer concentration within the body are then constructed by computer analysis.  In modern PET-CT scanners, three-dimensional imaging is often accomplished with the aid of a CT X-ray scan performed on the patient during the same session, in the same machine. If the biologically active molecule chosen for PET is fludeoxyglucose (FDG), an analogue of glucose, the concentrations of tracer imaged will indicate tissue metabolic activity as it corresponds to the regional glucose uptake. 

Percival Lowell<====>24033<====>Percival Lowell  Percival Lawrence Lowell ( ; March 13, 1855 – November 12, 1916) was an American businessman, author, mathematician, and astronomer who fueled speculation that there were canals on Mars.  He founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona and formed the beginning of the effort that led to the discovery of Pluto 14 years after his death. BiographyPercival Lowell was a member of the wealthy Boston, Massachusetts, Lowell family.  He was born in Cambridge on March 13, 1855,    the brother of Abbott Lawrence Lowell and Amy Lowell.Percival graduated from the Noble and Greenough School in 1872 and Harvard University in 1876 with distinction in mathematics. 

Pavane<====>24041<====>Pavane The pavane, pavan, paven, pavin, pavian, pavine, or pavyn (It.  pavana, padovana; Ger.  Paduana) is a slow processional dance common in Europe during the 16th century (Renaissance). The pavane, the earliest-known music for which was published in Venice by Ottaviano Petrucci, in Joan Ambrosio Dalza's Intabolatura de lauto libro quarto in 1508, is a sedate and dignified couple dance, similar to the 15th-century basse danse.  The music which accompanied it appears originally to have been fast or moderately fast but, like many other dances, became slower over time  . Origin of termThe word "Pavane" is most probably derived from Italian "[danza] Padovana"  ,  , meaning "[dance] typical of Padua" (similar to Bergamask, "dance from Bergamo"); "pavan" is a dialectal/old form for the modern Italian adjective "padovano" (= from Padua). 

Project management<====>24042<====>Project management Project management is the discipline of initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing the work of a team to achieve specific goals and meet specific success criteria at the specified time.  A project is a temporary endeavor designed to produce a unique product, service or result with a defined beginning and end (usually time-constrained, and often constrained by funding or staffing) undertaken to meet unique goals and objectives, typically to bring about beneficial change or added value.The temporary nature of projects stands in contrast with business as usual (or operations),  which are repetitive, permanent, or semi-permanent functional activities to produce products or services. 

Phase (waves)<====>24047<====>Phase (waves)Phase is the position of  a point in time (an instant) on awaveform cycle.  A complete cycle is defined as the interval required for the waveform to return to its arbitrary initial value.  The graph to the right shows how one cycle constitutes 360° of phase.  The graph also shows how phase is sometimes expressed in radians, where one radian of phase equals approximately 57. 3°. 'Phase can also be an expression of relative displacement between two corresponding features (for example, peaks or zero crossings) of two waveforms having the same frequency.

Particle in a box<====>24048<====>Particle in a boxIn quantum mechanics, the particle in a box model (also known as the infinite potential well or the infinite square well) describes a particle free to move in a small space surrounded by impenetrable barriers.   The model is mainly used as a hypothetical example to illustrate the differences between classical and quantum systems.   In classical systems, for example, a ball trapped inside a large box, the particle can move at any speed within the box and it is no more likely to be found at one position than another.  However, when the well becomes very narrow (on the scale of a few nanometers), quantum effects become important. 

Peter F. Hamilton<====>24050<====>Peter F.  Hamilton   Peter F.  Hamilton (born 2 March 1960) is a British author.  He is best known for writing space opera.  As of the publication of his 10th novel in 2004, his works had sold over 2 million copies worldwide. BiographyPeter F.  Hamilton was born in Rutland, England on 2 March 1960.  He didn't attend university.   He said in an interview, "I did science at school up to age eighteen, I stopped doing English, English literature, writing at sixteen, I just wasn't interested in those days. " After he started writing in 1987, he sold his first short story to Fear Magazine in 1988. 

The Night's Dawn Trilogy<====>24052<====>The Night's Dawn Trilogy British author Peter F.  Hamilton's The Night's Dawn Trilogy consists of three science fiction novels: The Reality Dysfunction (1996), The Neutronium Alchemist (1997), and The Naked God (1999).  A collection of short stories, A Second Chance at Eden, shares the same universe, and The Confederation Handbook documents that universe in non-fiction style. The sprawling narrative deals with a far future when humanity wages war against past souls flooding back into the land of the living via possession (Al Capone and Fletcher Christian are among the returnees).  Hamilton's future is expansive and primarily optimistic, with huge sentient space habitats that can closely resemble a natural Eden. 

Pope Boniface I<====>24053<====>Pope Boniface I    Pope Boniface I ( ; died 4 September 422) was Pope from 28 December 418 to his death in 422.

Population inversion<====>24065<====>Population inversion In science, specifically statistical mechanics, a population inversion occurs while a system (such as a group of atoms or molecules) exists in a state in which more members of the system are in higher, excited states than in lower, unexcited energy states.  It is called an "inversion" because in many familiar and commonly encountered physical systems, this is not possible.  The concept is of fundamental importance in laser science because the production of a population inversion is a necessary step in the workings of a standard laser. Boltzmann distributions and thermal equilibriumTo understand the concept of a population inversion, it is necessary to understand some thermodynamics and the way that light interacts with matter. 

Paolo Uccello<====>24067<====>Paolo Uccello Paolo Uccello ( ; 1397 – 10 December 1475), born Paolo di Dono, was an Italian painter and mathematician who was notable for his pioneering work on visual perspective in art.  In his book Lives of the Artists Giorgio Vasari wrote that Uccello was obsessed by his interest in perspective and would stay up all night in his study trying to grasp the exact vanishing point.  While his contemporaries used perspective to narrate different or succeeding stories, Uccello used perspective to create a feeling of depth in his paintings.  His best known works are the three paintings representing the battle of San Romano, which were wrongly entitled the "Battle of Sant' Egidio of 1416" for a long period of time.

Conventional PCI<====>24075<====>Conventional PCI Conventional PCI, often shortened to PCI, is a local computer bus for attaching hardware devices in a computer.  PCI is the initialism for Peripheral Component Interconnect  and is part of the PCI Local Bus standard.  The PCI bus supports the functions found on a processor bus but in a standardized format that is independent of any particular processor's native bus.  Devices connected to the PCI bus appear to a bus master to be connected directly to its own bus and are assigned addresses in the processor's address space .  It is a parallel bus, synchronous to a single bus clock.

PostScript<====>24080<====>PostScript    PostScript (PS) is a page description language in the electronic publishing and desktop publishing business.   It is a dynamically typed, concatenative programming language and was created at Adobe Systems by John Warnock, Charles Geschke, Doug Brotz, Ed Taft and Bill Paxton from 1982 to 1984. HistoryThe concepts of the PostScript language were seeded in 1976 when John Warnock was working at Evans & Sutherland, a computer graphics company.  At that time John Warnock was developing an interpreter for a large three-dimensional graphics database of New York harbor.  Warnock conceived the Design System language to process the graphics. 

Pole vault<====>24082<====>Pole vault  Pole vaulting is a track and field event in which a person uses a long, flexible pole (which today is usually made either of fiberglass or carbon fiber) as an aid to jump over a bar.   Pole jumping competitions were known to the ancient Greeks, Cretans and Celts.  It has been a full medal event at the Olympic Games since 1896 for men and 2000 for women. It is typically classified as one of the four major jumping events in athletics, alongside the high jump, long jump and triple jump.  It is unusual among track and field sports in that it requires a significant amount of specialised equipment in order to participate, even at a basic level. 

Party of European Socialists<====>24083<====>Party of European Socialists  The Party of European Socialists (PES) is a social-democratic European political party.    The PES comprises national-level political parties from all member states of the European Union (EU) plus Norway.

Phenol<====>24085<====>Phenol   Phenol, also known as carbolic acid, is an aromatic organic compound with the molecular formula C 6 H 5 OH.  It is a white crystalline solid that is volatile.  The molecule consists of a phenyl group (−C 6 H 5 ) bonded to a hydroxyl group (−OH).  It is mildly acidic and requires careful handling due to its propensity to cause chemical burns. Phenol was first extracted from coal tar, but today is produced on a large scale (about 7 billion kg/year) from petroleum.   It is an important industrial commodity as a precursor to many materials and useful compounds.

In his dialogue, Protagoras, Plato credits him with having invented the role of the professional sophist. He also is believed to have created a major controversy during ancient times through his statement that, "Man is the measure of all things", interpreted by Plato to mean that there is no absolute truth, but that which individuals deem to be the truth.  Although there is reason to question the extent of the interpretation of his arguments that has followed, that concept of individual relativity was revolutionary for the time, and contrasted with other philosophical doctrines that claimed the universe was based on something objective, outside human influence or perceptions. 

Puritans<====>24091<====>Puritans   The Puritans were English Reformed Protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries who sought to "purify" the Church of England from its "Catholic" practices, maintaining that the Church of England was only partially reformed.  OverviewPuritanism in this sense was founded as an activist movement within the Church of England.  The founders, clergy exiled under Mary I, returned to England shortly after the accession of Elizabeth I of England in 1558. Puritanism played a significant role in English history during the first half of the 17th century.  One of the most effective stokers of anti-Catholic feeling was John Pym, whose movement succeeded in taking control of the government of London at the time of the Grand Remonstrance of 1641.

A plough may be made of wood, iron, or steel frame with an attached blade or stick used to cut the earth.  It has been a basic instrument for most of recorded history, although written references to the plough do not appear in English until c. 

Principle of bivalence<====>24097<====>Principle of bivalence In logic, the semantic principle (or law) of bivalence states that every declarative sentence expressing a proposition (of a theory under inspection) has exactly one truth value, either true or false. A logic satisfying this principle is called a two-valued logic    or bivalent logic.In formal logic, the principle of bivalence becomes a property that a semantics may or may not possess.  It is not the same as the law of excluded middle, however, and a semantics may satisfy that law without being bivalent.

Peer-to-peer<====>24107<====>Peer-to-peer  Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers.  Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application.  They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes. Peers make a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts.    Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional client-server model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided. 

Prime minister<====>24109<====>Prime minister A prime minister is the head of a cabinet and the leader of the ministers in the executive branch of government, often in a parliamentary or semi-presidential system.

In a minority of systems, notably in semi-presidential systems of government, a prime minister is the official who is appointed to manage the civil service and execute the directives of the head of state. 

President<====>24110<====>President The president is a common title for the head of state in most republics.  In politics, president is a title given to leaders of republican states. The functions exercised by a president vary according to the form of government.  In parliamentary and semi-presidential republics, they are limited to those of the head of state, and are thus largely ceremonial.  In presidential republics, the role of the president is more prominent, encompassing also (in most cases) the functions of the head of government.  In authoritarian regimes, a dictator or leader of a one-party state may also be called a president, often charismatically.

Religious affiliations of Presidents of the United States<====>24115<====>Religious affiliations of Presidents of the United States The religious affiliations of Presidents of the United States can affect their electability, shape their stances on policy matters and their visions of society and also how they want to lead it.  Speculation of Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln,   and William Howard Taft  being atheists was reported during election campaigns, while others, such as Jimmy Carter,  used faith as a defining aspect of their campaigns and tenure to hold the office.  Almost all of the presidents can be characterized as Christian, at least by upbringing, though some were unaffiliated with any specific religious body. 

Peer review<====>24116<====>Peer review    Peer review is the evaluation of work by one or more people of similar competence to the producers of the work (peers).  It constitutes a form of self-regulation by qualified members of a profession within the relevant field.  Peer review methods are employed to maintain standards of quality, improve performance, and provide credibility.  In academia, scholarly peer review is often used to determine an academic paper's suitability for publication.  Peer review can be categorized by the type of activity and by the field or profession in which the activity occurs, e.

Passive management<====>24118<====>Passive management Passive management (also called passive investing) is an investing strategy that tracks a market-weighted index or portfolio. The most popular method is to mimic the performance of an externally specified index by buying an index fund.  By tracking an index, an investment portfolio typically gets good diversification, low turnover (good for keeping down internal transaction costs), and low management fees.   With low fees, an investor in such a fund would have higher returns than a similar fund with similar investments but higher management fees and/or turnover/transaction costs.  William F.

Pan flute<====>24126<====>Pan flute  The pan flutes (also known as panpipes or syrinx) are a group of musical instruments based on the principle of the closed tube, consisting of multiple pipes of gradually increasing length (and occasionally girth).  Multiple varieties of pan flutes have long been popular as folk instruments.  The pipes are typically made from bamboo, giant cane, or local reeds.  Other materials include wood, plastic, metal and ivory. EtymologyThe pan flute is named after Pan, the Greek god of nature and shepherds often depicted with such an instrument.  In Greek mythology, Syrinx (Σύριγξ) was a forest Nymph. 

Energy storage<====>24130<====>Energy storage  Energy storage is the capture of energy produced at one time for use at a later time.  A device that stores energy is sometimes called an accumulator or battery.  Energy comes in multiple forms including radiation, chemical, gravitational potential, electrical potential, electricity, elevated temperature, latent heat and kinetic.  Energy storage involves converting energy from forms that are difficult to store to more conveniently or economically storable forms.  Bulk energy storage is currently dominated by hydroelectric dams, both conventional as well as pumped. Some technologies provide short-term energy storage, while others can endure for much longer. 

PHP<====>24131<====>PHP   PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language.  Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994,    the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,  but it now stands for the  recursive backronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor PHP code may be embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in combination with various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks.  PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. 

Priam<====>24132<====>Priam In Greek mythology, Priam ( ;  , Príamos,  ) was the king of Troy during the Trojan War and youngest son of Laomedon.  In the Post-Homeric History of the Fall of Troy, he was described as provided with "a handsome face and a pleasant voice", "large and swarthy".  EtymologyModern scholars derive his name from the Luwian name Pariya-muwas, which meant “exceptionally courageous”   and was attested as the name of a man from Zazlippa, in Kizzuwatna.  A similar form is attested transcribed in Greek as Paramoas near Kaisareia in Cappadocia.  Notable is also Piyama-Radu, a warlike man whose name figures prominently in the Hittite archives, possibly bearing a related name. 

Principia Mathematica<====>24133<====>Principia Mathematica  The Principia Mathematica (often abbreviated PM) is a three-volume work on the foundations of mathematics written by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell and published in 1910, 1912, and 1913.  In 1925–27, it appeared in a second edition with an important Introduction to the Second Edition, an Appendix A that replaced ✸9 and all-new Appendix B and Appendix C. PM was an attempt to describe a set of axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic from which all mathematical truths could in principle be proven.  As such, this ambitious project is of great importance in the history of mathematics and philosophy,    being one of the foremost products of the belief that such an undertaking may be achievable. 

Prime Minister of Canada<====>24135<====>Prime Minister of Canada The Prime Minister of Canada ( ) is the primary minister of the Crown, chairman of the Cabinet, and thus Canada's head of government, charged with advising the Canadian monarch or federal viceroy on the exercise of the executive powers vested in them by the constitution.   Not outlined in any constitutional document, the office exists only as per long-established convention (originating in Canada's former colonial power, the United Kingdom) that stipulates the monarch's representative, the governor general, must select as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons; this individual is typically the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber. 

Process theology<====>24136<====>Process theology  Process theology is a type of theology developed from Alfred North Whitehead's (1861–1947) process philosophy, most notably by Charles Hartshorne (1897–2000) and John B.  Cobb (b.  1925).  Process theology and process philosophy are collectively referred to as "process thought. "For both Whitehead and Hartshorne, it is an essential attribute of God to affect and be affected by temporal processes, contrary to the forms of theism that hold God to be in all respects non-temporal (eternal), unchanging ( ), and unaffected by the world ( ).  Process theology does not deny that God is in some respects eternal (will never die), immutable (in the sense that God is unchangingly good), and impassible (in the sense that God's eternal aspect is unaffected by actuality), but it contradicts the classical view by insisting that God is in some respects temporal, mutable, and passible. 

Proton decay<====>24138<====>Proton decay In particle physics, proton decay is a hypothetical form of radioactive decay in which the proton decays into lighter subatomic particles, such as a neutral pion and a positron.   The proton decay hypothesis was first formulated by Andrei Sakharov in 1967.   There is currently no experimental evidence that proton decay occurs. According to the Standard Model, protons, a type of baryon, are stable because baryon number (quark number) is conserved (under normal circumstances; see chiral anomaly for exception).  Therefore, protons will not decay into other particles on their own, because they are the lightest (and therefore least energetic) baryon. 

Paul the Apostle<====>24140<====>Paul the Apostle    Paul the Apostle ( ;  ; c.  5 – c.  67), commonly known as Saint Paul and also known by his Jewish name Saul of Tarsus ( ;  ), was an apostle (though not one of the Twelve Apostles) who taught the gospel of the Christ to the first century world.  Powell, Mark A.  Introducing the New Testament.   Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic.  2009.    Paul is generally considered one of the most important figures of the Apostolic Age Sanders, E. 

Perestroika<====>24143<====>Perestroika   Perestroika ( )  was a political movement for reformation within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union during the 1980s until 1991 widely associated with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and his glasnost (meaning "openness") policy reform.  The literal meaning of perestroika is "restructuring", referring to the restructuring of the Soviet political and economic system. Perestroika is sometimes argued to be a cause of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the revolutions of 1989 in Eastern Europe, and the end of the Cold War.  SummaryPerestroika  allowed more independent actions from various ministries and introduced some market-like reforms. 

Polyphony<====>24144<====>Polyphony In music, polyphony is one type of musical texture, where a texture is, generally speaking, the way that melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic aspects of a musical composition are combined to shape the overall sound and quality of the work.  In particular, polyphony consists of two or more simultaneous lines of independent melody, as opposed to a musical texture with just one voice, monophony, or a texture with one dominant melodic voice accompanied by chords, which is called homophony. Within the context of the Western musical tradition, the term polyphony is usually used to refer to music of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. 

Pun<====>24145<====>Pun  The pun, also called paronomasia, is a form of wordplay that exploits multiple meanings of a term, or of similar-sounding words, for an intended humorous or rhetorical effect.    These ambiguities can arise from the intentional use of homophonic, homographic, metonymic, or figurative language.  A pun differs from a malapropism in that a malapropism is an incorrect variation on a correct expression, while a pun involves expressions with multiple correct interpretations.  Puns may be regarded as in-jokes or idiomatic constructions, as their usage and meaning are specific to a particular language and its culture. 

Pope Clement XII<====>24146<====>Pope Clement XII  Pope Clement XII ( ; 7 April 1652 – 6 February 1740), born Lorenzo Corsini, was Pope from 12 July 1730 to his death in 1740. Clement presided over the growth of a surplus in the papal finances.  He thus became known for building the new façade of the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano, beginning construction of the Trevi Fountain, and the purchase of Cardinal Alessandro Albani's collection of antiquities for the papal gallery.  In his 1738 bull In eminenti apostolatus, he provides the first public papal condemnation of Freemasonry, helping bring about the Catholic Church's longstanding opposition to the order. 

Palindrome<====>24147<====>Palindrome A  palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or “taco cat” or racecar.  Sentence-length palindromes may be written when allowances are made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers, such as "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!", "Was it a car or a cat I saw?" or "No 'x' in Nixon". Composing literature in palindromes is an example of constrained writing. The word "palindrome" was coined by the English playwright Ben Jonson in the 17th century from the Greek roots   ( ; "again") and   ( ; "way, direction"). 

Pope Clement XIII<====>24148<====>Pope Clement XIII    Pope Clement XIII ( ; 7 March 1693 – 2 February 1769), born Carlo della Torre di Rezzonico, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 6 July 1758 to his death in 1769.  He was installed on 16 July 1758.  His pontificate was overshadowed by the constant pressure to suppress the Society of Jesus but despite this, he championed their order and also proved to be their greatest defender at that time. He was also one of the few early popes who favoured dialogue with Old Catholic Protestants and to this effect hoped to mend the schism with the Catholic Church that existed in England and the low countries. 

Pope Clement XIV<====>24149<====>Pope Clement XIV    Pope Clement XIV ( ; 31 October 1705 – 22 September 1774), born Giovanni Vincenzo Antonio Ganganelli, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 19 May 1769 to his death in 1774.  At the time of his election, he was the only Franciscan friar in the College of Cardinals.   To date, he is the last pope to take the pontifical name of "Clement" upon his election. He is best known for his suppression of the Society of Jesus. BiographyEarly lifeGanganelli was born in Santarcangelo di Romagna in 1705  as the second child of Lorenzo Ganganelli and Angela Serafina Maria Mazza. 

Prime Minister of the United Kingdom<====>24150<====>Prime Minister of the United Kingdom    The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is the head of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom.  The Prime Minister (sometimes informally abbreviated to PM) and Cabinet (consisting of all the most senior ministers, most of whom are government department heads) are collectively accountable for their policies and actions to the Monarch, to Parliament, to their political party and ultimately to the electorate.  The office is one of the Great Offices of State.  The   of the office, Theresa May, leader of the Conservative Party, was appointed by the Queen on 13 July 2016. 

Flatworm<====>24151<====>Flatworm  The flatworms, flat worms, Platyhelminthes, Plathelminthes, or platyhelminths (from the Greek πλατύ, platy, meaning "flat" and ἕλμινς (root: ἑλμινθ-), helminth-, meaning "worm")  are a phylum of relatively simple bilaterian, unsegmented, soft-bodied invertebrates.  Unlike other bilaterians, they are acoelomates (having no body cavity), and have no specialized circulatory and respiratory organs, which restricts them to having flattened shapes that allow oxygen and nutrients to pass through their bodies by diffusion.  The digestive cavity has only one opening for both ingestion (intake of nutrients) and egestion (removal of undigested wastes); as a result, the food cannot be processed continuously. 

Pope Celestine I<====>24152<====>Pope Celestine I   Pope Celestine I ( ; d.  1 August 432) was Pope from 10 September 422 to his death in 432.  According to the Liber Pontificalis, the start of his papacy was 3 November.However, Tillemont places the date at 10 September.    Celestine's tenure was largely spent combatting various ideologies deemed heretical.  He supported the mission of the Gallic bishops that sent Germanus of Auxerre in 429, to Britain to address Pelagianism, and later commissioned Palladius as bishop to the Scots of Ireland and northern Britain. 

Pope Celestine II<====>24153<====>Pope Celestine II   Pope Celestine II ( ; died 8 March 1144), born Guido di Castello, Thomas, pg.  91  was Pope from 26 September 1143  to his death in 1144.  He is the first pope mentioned in the prophecy of Saint Malachy. Early lifeGuido di Castello, possibly the son of a local noble, Niccolo di Castello, Mann, pg.  105  was born either in Città di Castello, situated in Paterna Santa Felicità upon the Apennines, or at Macerata in the March of Ancona.  Mann, pg.  105  Guido had studied under Pierre Abélard, and eventually became a distinguished master in the schools. 

Pope Celestine III<====>24154<====>Pope Celestine III  Pope Celestine III ( ; c.  1106 – 8 January 1198), born Giacinto Bobone,  reigned from 30 March or 10 April 1191  to his death in 1198.  He was born into the noble Orsini family in Rome and served as a cardinal-deacon prior to becoming pope.   He was ordained as a priest on 13 April 1191 and he ruled the church for six years, nine months, and nine days before he died aged 92.  He was buried at the Lateran. BiographyCardinalConsidered by the Roman Curia as an expert on Spain, Bobone conducted two legatine missions to Spain in (1154–55) and (1172–75) as the Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria in Cosmedin. 

Pope Celestine IV<====>24155<====>Pope Celestine IV  Pope Celestine IV ( ; died 10 November 1241), born Goffredo da Castiglione, was Pope from 25 October 1241 to his death on 10 November of the same year. Born in Milan, Goffredo or Godfrey is often referred to as son of a sister of Pope Urban III, but this claim is without foundation.   Nothing is known of his early life until he became chancellor of the church of Milan (perhaps as early as 1219, certainly in 1223–27).  Pope Gregory IX made him a cardinal on 18 September 1227  with the diocese and benefice of San Marco,  and in 1228–29 sent him as legate in Lombardy and Tuscany, where the cities and communes had generally remained true to the Hohenstaufen emperor, Frederick II. 

Pope Celestine V<====>24156<====>Pope Celestine V   Pope Celestine V ( ; 1215 – 19 May 1296), born Pietro Angelerio (according to some sources Angelario, Angelieri, Angelliero, or Angeleri), also known as Pietro da Morrone, Peter of Morrone, and Peter Celestine, was pope for five months from 5 July to 13 December 1294, when he resigned.  He was also a monk and hermit who founded the order of the Celestines as a branch of the Benedictine order.

Paul Desmond<====>24159<====>Paul Desmond  Paul Desmond (born Paul Emil Breitenfeld, November 25, 1924 – May 30, 1977) was an American jazz alto saxophonist and composer, best known for his work with the Dave Brubeck Quartet and for composing that group's biggest hit, "Take Five".  He was one of the most popular musicians to come out of the cool jazz scene. In addition to his work with Brubeck, he led several groups and collaborated with Gerry Mulligan, Chet Baker, Jim Hall, and Ed Bickert.   After years of chain smoking and poor health, Desmond succumbed to lung cancer in 1977 following one last tour with Brubeck. 

Piper (plant)<====>24160<====>Piper (plant)DISPLAYTITLE Piper, the pepper plants or pepper vines (a term used for certain Clematis in older times), are an economically and ecologically important genus in the family Piperaceae. It contains about 1,000-2,000 species of shrubs, herbs, and lianas, many of which are dominant species in their native habitat.  The diversification of this taxon is of interest to understanding the evolution of plants. Pepper plants belong to the magnoliids, which are angiosperms but neither monocots nor eudicots.  Their family, Piperaceae, is most closely related to the lizardtail family (Saururaceae), which in fact generally look like smaller, more delicate and   pepper plants. 

Pride and Prejudice<====>24162<====>Pride and PrejudicePride and Prejudice is a romance novel by Jane Austen, first published in 1813.  The story charts the emotional development of the protagonist, Elizabeth Bennet, who learns the error of making hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between the superficial and the essential.  The comedy of the writing lies in the depiction of manners, education, marriage, and money during the British Regency period. Mr.  Bennet of the Longbourn estate has five daughters, but his property is entailed, meaning that none of the girls can inherit it.  His wife has no fortune, so it is imperative that at least one of the girls marry well in order to support the others on his death. 

Palace of Westminster<====>24170<====>Palace of Westminster   The Palace of Westminster is the meeting place of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the two houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  Commonly known as the Houses of Parliament after its occupants, the Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster, in central London. Its name, which is derived from the neighbouring Westminster Abbey, may refer to either of two structures: the Old Palace, a medieval building complex destroyed by fire in 1834, and its replacement, the New Palace that stands today. 

Plautus<====>24171<====>Plautus  Titus Maccius Plautus (c.  254 – 184 BC), commonly known as Plautus, was a Roman playwright of the Old Latin period.  His comedies are the earliest Latin literary works to have survived in their entirety.  He wrote Palliata comoedia, the genre devised by the innovator of Latin literature, Livius Andronicus.  The word Plautine   refers to both Plautus's own works and works similar to or influenced by his. BiographyNot much is known about Titus Maccius Plautus' early life.  It is believed that he was born in Sarsina, a small town in Emilia Romagna in northern Italy, in around 254 BC. 

Pythagorean triple<====>24172<====>Pythagorean tripleA Pythagorean triple consists of three positive integers  ,  , and  , such that  .  Such a triple is commonly written  , and a well-known example is  .  If   is a Pythagorean triple, then so is   for any positive integer  .  A primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which  ,   and   are coprime (that is, they have no common divisor larger than 1).   A triangle whose sides form a Pythagorean triple is called a Pythagorean triangle, and is necessarily a right triangle. 

Pattern welding<====>24175<====>Pattern welding Pattern welding is the practice in sword and knife making of forming a blade of several metal pieces of differing composition that are forge-welded together and twisted and manipulated to form a pattern.  Often called (Modern) Damascus steel, blades forged in this manner often display bands of slightly different patterning along their entire length.  These bands can be highlighted for cosmetic purposes by proper polishing or acid etching.  Pattern welding was an outgrowth of laminated or piled steel, a similar technique used to combine steels of different carbon contents, providing a desired mix of hardness and toughness. 

Pablo Picasso<====>24176<====>Pablo Picasso  Pablo Picasso ( ;   ; 25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, stage designer, poet and playwright who spent most of his adult life in France.  Regarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture,   the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore.  Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), and Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by the German and Italian airforces. 

Palm Sunday<====>24178<====>Palm Sunday    Palm Sunday is a Christian moveable feast that falls on the Sunday before Easter.  The feast commemorates Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, an event mentioned in each of the four canonical Gospels.  In many Catholic and Episcopal denominations, worship services on Palm Sunday include a procession of the faithful carrying palms, representing the palm branches the crowd scattered in front of Jesus as he rode into Jerusalem.  The difficulty of procuring palms in unfavorable climates led to their substitution with branches of native trees, including box, olive, willow, and yew.  The Sunday was often named after these substitute trees, as in Yew Sunday, or by the general term Branch Sunday. 

Preterism<====>24181<====>Preterism Preterism is a Christian eschatological view that interprets some (partial preterism) or all (full preterism) prophecies of the Bible as events which have already happened.  This school of thought interprets the Book of Daniel as referring to events that happened in the 2nd century BC, while seeing the prophecies of Revelation as events that happened in the first century AD.  Preterism holds that Ancient Israel finds its continuation or fulfillment in the Christian church at the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70. The term preterism comes from the Latin praeter, which Webster's 1913 dictionary lists as a prefix denoting that something is "past" or "beyond". 

Per Hasselberg<====>24182<====>Per HasselbergPer Hasselberg (January 1, 1850 – July 25, 1894) was a Swedish sculptor.  He was also known as Petter Hasselberg or Petter Åkesson.   Little known outside Sweden, his delicate marble nudes have received critical acclaim.   Hasselberg grew up in Blekinge, but moved to Paris as a young man, where he studied under François Jouffroy.   His first notable work was a sculpture titled Snöklockan. It represents a young girl rising/standing nude (the name is from the plant snowdrop which is rising every spring)Other famous work are the sculpture "Grodan" (a nude young girl playing with a frog). 

Parma, Michigan<====>24183<====>Parma, Michigan  Parma is a village in Jackson County in the U. S.  state of Michigan.   The population was 769 at the 2010 census. Parma is the birthplace of world-renowned ecologist and soil scientist Dr.  Robert E.  Horton and NASCAR driver Brian Tyler. HistoryParma was originally located a few miles east of its current location along the Michigan Central Railroad at a stop known as Gidley's Station.   When it was moved to its current location, it was known as Groveland, after a noticeable grove of trees within the town.   Part of this grove still exists where Grove St. 

Infant baptism<====>24184<====>Infant baptism Infant baptism  is the practice of baptising infants or young children.  In theological discussions, the practice is sometimes referred to as paedobaptism, or pedobaptism, from the Greek pais meaning "child".  This can be contrasted with what is called "believer's baptism", or credobaptism, from the Latin word credo meaning "I believe", which is the religious practice of baptising only individuals who personally confess faith in Jesus, therefore excluding underage children.  Opposition to infant baptism is termed catabaptism.  Infant baptism is also called "christening" by some faith traditions. Most Christians belong to denominations that practice infant baptism. 

Pseudocode<====>24185<====>Pseudocode Pseudocode is an informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm. It uses the structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading.  Pseudocode typically omits details that are essential for machine understanding of the algorithm, such as variable declarations, system-specific code and some subroutines.  The programming language is augmented with natural language description details, where convenient, or with compact mathematical notation.  The purpose of using pseudocode is that it is easier for people to understand than conventional programming language code, and that it  is an efficient and environment-independent description of the key principles of an algorithm. 

Pre-existence<====>24186<====>Pre-existencePre-existence, preexistence, beforelife, or premortal existence refers to the belief that each individual human soul existed before mortal conception, and at some point before birth enters or is placed into the body.  Concepts of pre-existence can encompass either the belief that the soul came into existence at some time prior to conception or the belief that the soul is eternal.  Alternative positions are traducianism and creationism, which both hold that the individual human soul does not come into existence until conception.  It is to be distinguished from preformation, which is about physical existence and applies to all living things. 

Prussian Confederation<====>24187<====>Prussian Confederation The Prussian Confederation ( ,  ) was an organization formed on 21 February 1440 at Marienwerder by a group of 53 nobles and clergy and 19 cities in Prussia, to oppose the arbitrariness of the Teutonic Knights.  It was based on the basis of an earlier similar organization, the Lizard Union established in 1397 by Chełmno Land nobles.  In 1454, the leader of the Confederation, Johannes von Baysen (Jan Bażyński), formally asked King Casimir IV Jagiellon, to incorporate Prussia into the Kingdom of Poland as a fief.  This marked the beginning of the Thirteen Years' War between the Order's State and Poland, with the Prussian cities financing the military costs of the latter. 

Parimutuel betting<====>24188<====>Parimutuel bettingParimutuel betting (from the   or mutual betting) is a betting system in which all bets of a particular type are placed together in a pool; taxes and the "house-take" or "vigorish" are removed, and payoff odds are calculated by sharing the pool among all winning bets.  In some countries it is known as the Tote after the totalisator, which calculates and displays bets already made. The parimutuel system is used in gambling on horse racing, greyhound racing, jai alai, and all sporting events of relatively short duration in which participants finish in a ranked order.  A modified parimutuel system is also used in some lottery games. 

Possession (law)<====>24189<====>Possession (law)   In law, possession is the  control a person intentionally exercises toward a thing.  In all cases, to possess something, a person must have an intention to possess it.  A person may be in possession of some property (although possession does not always imply ownership).  Like ownership, the possession of things is commonly regulated by states under property law. Intention to possessAn intention to possess (sometimes called animus possidendi) is the other component of possession.  All that is required is an intention to possess something for the time being.  In common law countries, the intention to possess a thing is a fact.

" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol.  6.  New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909.  18 September 2017  His defiance of the Byzantine emperor Leo III the Isaurian as a result of the iconoclastic controversy in the Eastern Empire prepared the way for a long series of revolts, schisms and civil wars that eventually led to the establishment of the temporal power of the popes. 

Pope Gregory III<====>24194<====>Pope Gregory III  Pope Gregory III ( ; died 28 November 741) was Pope from 11 February 731 to his death in 741.His pontificate, like that of his predecessor, was disturbed by the iconoclastic controversy in the Byzantine Empire, and by the ongoing advance of the Lombards, in which he invoked the intervention of Charles Martel, although ultimately in vain.

Public-key cryptography<====>24222<====>Public-key cryptography  Public key cryptography, or asymmetrical cryptography, is any cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys which may be disseminated widely, and private keys which are known only to the owner.   This accomplishes two functions: authentication, where the public key verifies a holder of the paired private key sent the message, and encryption, where only the paired private key holder can decrypt the message encrypted with the public key. In a public key encryption system, any person can encrypt a message using the receiver's public key.  That encrypted message can only be decrypted with the receiver's private key. 

Plan 9 from Bell Labs<====>24226<====>Plan 9 from Bell Labs  Plan 9 from Bell Labs is a distributed operating system, originating in the Computing Sciences Research Center (CSRC) at Bell Labs in the mid-1980s, and building on UNIX concepts first developed there in the late 1960s; until the Labs' final release at the start of 2015.  UNIX's 'everything is a file' metaphor was to be extended via a pervasive network-centric filesystem, and graphical user interface assumed as a basis for almost all functionality, though retaining a heavily text-centric ideology.  Authoring of source code was made as close to platform-agnostic as possible, while the physical login location of a user was also to be considered arbitrary and irrelevant, as far as practical within the limits of available hardware and laws of physics.

Biological anthropology<====>24232<====>Biological anthropology Biological anthropology, also known as physical anthropology, is a scientific discipline concerned with the biological and behavioral aspects of human beings, their related non-human primates and their extinct hominin ancestors.   It is a subfield of anthropology that provides a biological perspective to the systematic study of human beings. BranchesAs a subfield of anthropology, biological anthropology itself is further divided into several branches.  All branches are united in their common application of evolutionary theory to understanding human morphology and behavior.  Paleoanthropology is the study of fossil evidence for human evolution, mainly using remains from extinct hominin and other primate species to determine the morphological and behavioral changes in the human lineage, as well as the environment in which human evolution occurred. 

Power (physics)<====>24236<====>Power (physics)   In physics, power is the rate of doing work, the amount of energy transferred per unit time.   Having no direction, it is a scalar quantity.   In the International System of Units, the unit of power is the joule per second (J/s), known as the watt in honour of James Watt, the eighteenth-century developer of the steam engine condenser.   Another common and traditional measure is horsepower (comparing to the power of a horse).   Being the rate of work, the equation for power can be written: \text{power}=\frac{\text{work}}{\text{time}} The integral of power over time defines the work performed. 

Pai gow poker<====>24239<====>Pai gow poker  Pai gow poker (also called double-hand poker) is an Americanized version of pai gow (in that it is played with playing cards bearing poker hand values, instead of pai gow's Chinese dominoes).  The game of pai gow poker was created in 1985 by Sam Torosian, owner of the Bell Card Club.The game is played with a standard 52-card deck, plus a single joker.   It is played on a table set for six players, plus the dealer.   Each player attempts to defeat the banker (who may be the casino dealer, one of the other players at the table, or a player acting in tandem with the dealer as co-bankers). 

Protoscience<====>24241<====>Protoscience In the philosophy of science, there are several definitions of protoscience. Its simplest meaning (most closely reflecting its roots of   + science) involves the earliest eras of the history of science, when the scientific method was  .  Thus, in the late 17th century and early 18th century, Isaac Newton contributed to the dawning sciences of chemistry and physics, even though he was also an alchemist who sought chrysopoeia in various ways including some that were unscientific.  Scientists in the 21st century can view his contributions as protoscience. Another meaning extends this idea into the present, involving the distinction between hard and soft sciences, in which various sciences (or branches  thereof) are ranked according to methodological rigor.

Although typically associated with the Prussian Army, which adopted it in 1842–43,  the helmet was widely imitated by other armies during this period.  HistoryOriginsThe Pickelhaube was originally designed in 1842 by King Frederick William IV of Prussia,  perhaps as a copy of similar helmets that were adopted at the same time by the Russian military.   It is not clear whether this was a case of imitation, parallel invention, or if both were based on the earlier Napoleonic cuirassier.

Province of Canada<====>24247<====>Province of Canada The United Province of Canada, or the Province of Canada, or the United Canadas was a British colony in North America from 1841 to 1867.  Its formation reflected recommendations made by John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham in the Report on the Affairs of British North America following the Rebellions of 1837–38. The Act of Union 1840, passed 23 July 1840, by the British Parliament and proclaimed by the Crown on 10 February 1841,  merged the Colonies of Upper Canada and Lower Canada by abolishing their separate parliaments and replacing them with a single one with two houses, a Legislative Council as the upper chamber and the Legislative Assembly as the lower chamber.

Persephone was married to Hades, the god of the underworld.  Martin Nilsson (1967).  Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion Vol I pp 462–463, 479–480  The myth of her abduction represents her function as the personification of vegetation, which shoots forth in spring and withdraws into the earth after harvest; hence, she is also associated with spring as well as the fertility of vegetation. 

Pandemic<====>24255<====>Pandemic A pandemic (from Greek πᾶν pan "all" and δῆμος demos "people") is an epidemic of infectious disease that has spread through human populations across a large region; for instance multiple continents, or even worldwide. A widespread endemic disease that is stable in terms of how many people are getting sick from it is not a pandemic.  Further, flu pandemics generally exclude recurrences of seasonal flu.  Throughout history, there have been a number of pandemics, such as smallpox and tuberculosis.  One of the most devastating pandemics was the Black Death, killing over 75 million people in 1350.

Panga<====>24263<====>Panga  Panga is the common South African name for Pterogymnus laniarius, a small,   fish, native to the southeast Atlantic Ocean and southwest Indian Ocean.  Alternatively called "torpedo scads", they are cold-blooded with white flesh.   Their scales are generally pink in color with whitish underbelly and blue-green stripes running laterally along their sides. Over the course of its life, a panga will undergo periodic sex-changes with as much as 30% of the population being hermaphroditic at a time.   Despite the presence of both sex organs, it is thought unlikely that both are simultaneously active.

Ping (networking utility)<====>24265<====>Ping (networking utility) ping is a computer network administration software utility used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.  It measures the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer that are echoed back to the source.  The name comes from active sonar terminology that sends a pulse of sound and listens for the echo to detect objects under water,  although it is sometimes interpreted as a backronym to packet Internet groper.  Ping operates by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request packets to the target host and waiting for an ICMP echo reply. 

Profinite group<====>24266<====>Profinite groupIn mathematics, profinite groups are topological groups that are in a certain sense assembled from finite groups.  They share many properties with their finite quotients: for example, both Lagrange's theorem and the Sylow theorems generalise well to profinite groups.  A non-compact generalization of a profinite group is a locally profinite group. DefinitionProfinite groups can be defined in one of two equivalent ways. First definitionA profinite group is a topological group that is isomorphic to the inverse limit of an inverse system of discrete finite groups.   In this context, an inverse system consists of a directed set   (I, \le) , a collection of finite groups  \mathcal G = \{G_i: i \in I\} , each having the discrete topology, and a collection of homomorphisms  \{f^j_{i}: G_j \to G_i \mid i, j \in I, i \le j\}  such that  f_i^i  is the identity on  G_i  and the collection satisfies the composition property  f^j_i \circ f^k_j = f^k_i .

Pawnbroker<====>24268<====>PawnbrokerA pawnbroker  is an individual or business (pawnshop or pawn shop) that offers secured loans to people, with items of personal property used as collateral.  The items having been pawned to the broker are themselves called pledges or pawns, or simply the collateral.  While many items can be pawned, pawnshops typically accept jewelry, musical instruments, home audio equipment, computers, video game systems, televisions, cameras, power tools and other relatively valuable items as collateral.

Process philosophy<====>24269<====>Process philosophy  Process philosophy (also ontology of becoming, processism,  or philosophy of organism ) identifies metaphysical reality with change and development.  Since the time of Plato and Aristotle, philosophers have posited true reality as "timeless", based on permanent substances, while processes are denied or subordinated to timeless substances.  If Socrates changes, becoming sick, Socrates is still the same (the substance of Socrates being the same), and change (his sickness) only glides over his substance: change is accidental, whereas the substance is essential.  Therefore, classic ontology denies any full reality to change, which is conceived as only accidental and not essential.

Because Sergius III had reputedly ordered the murder of his two immediate predecessors, Leo V and  Christopher, and was the only pope to have allegedly fathered an illegitimate son who later became pope (John XI), his pontificate has been variously described as "dismal and disgraceful",  and "efficient and ruthless".

Projective plane<====>24350<====>Projective planeIn mathematics, a projective plane is a geometric structure that extends the concept of a plane.  In the ordinary Euclidean plane, two lines typically intersect in a single point, but there are some pairs of lines (namely, parallel lines) that do not intersect.  A projective plane can be thought of as an ordinary plane equipped with additional "points at infinity" where parallel lines intersect.  Thus any two distinct lines in a projective plane intersect in one and only one point. Renaissance artists, in developing the techniques of drawing in perspective, laid the groundwork for this mathematical topic.

Pharmacology<====>24354<====>Pharmacology  Pharmacology is the branch of biology concerned with the study of drug action,  where a drug can be broadly defined as any man-made, natural, or endogenous (from within body) molecule which exerts a biochemical or physiological effect on the cell, tissue, organ, or organism (sometimes the word pharmacon is used as a term to encompass these endogenous and exogenous bioactive species).  More specifically, it is the study of the interactions that occur between a living organism and chemicals that affect normal or abnormal biochemical function.  If substances have medicinal properties, they are considered pharmaceuticals. The field encompasses drug composition and properties, synthesis and drug design, molecular and cellular mechanisms, organ/systems mechanisms, signal transduction/cellular communication, molecular diagnostics, interactions, toxicology, chemical biology, therapy, and medical applications and antipathogenic capabilities.

Perth is part of the South West Land Division of Western Australia, with the majority of the metropolitan area located on the Swan Coastal Plain, a narrow strip between the Indian Ocean and the Darling Scarp.  The first areas settled were on the Swan River at Guildford, with the city's central business district and port (Fremantle) both later founded downriver. 

Human pathogen<====>24358<====>Human pathogenA human pathogen is a pathogen (microbe or microorganism such as a virus, bacterium, prion, or fungus)  that causes disease in humans. The human physiological defense against common pathogens (such as Pneumocystis) is mainly the responsibility of the  immune system with help by some of the body's normal flora and fauna.  However, if the immune system or "good" microbiota are damaged in any way (such as by chemotherapy, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or antibiotics being taken to kill other pathogens), pathogenic bacteria that were being held at bay can proliferate and cause harm to the host. 

People Against Gangsterism and Drugs<====>24363<====>People Against Gangsterism and Drugs  People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (PAGAD) was a vigilante group formed in 1996 in the Cape Flats area of Cape Town, South Africa. OriginsPAGAD was originally initiated by a handful of PAC and community  members from a Cape Town townships who decided to organize public demonstrations to pressure the government to fight the illegal drug trade and gangsterism more effectively.    However, PAGAD increasingly took matters into their own hands, believing the police were not taking enough action against gangs.   Initially the community and police were hesitant to act against PAGAD activities, recognising the need for community action against crime in the gang-ridden communities of the Cape Flats.

Porsche 924<====>24366<====>Porsche 924 The Porsche 924 is a sports car produced by Porsche AG of Germany from 1976 to 1988.  A two-door, 2+2 coupé, the 924 was intended to replace the Porsche 914 as the company's entry-level model. Although the water-cooled, front-engined 928 gran turismo was designed first, the 924 was the first road-going Porsche to have a front engine rear wheel drive configuration.  It was also the first Porsche to be offered with a fully automatic transmission. The 924 made its public debut in November 1975.  It was criticised by enthusiasts for its mediocre performance, but a sales success with just over 150,000 produced during a 1977-1988 production run, and an important profits generator for the company. 

Pain<====>24373<====>Pain   Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli.  Because it is a complex, subjective phenomenon, defining pain has been a challenge.  The International Association for the Study of Pain's widely used definition states: "Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. "   Derived from    In medical diagnosis, pain is regarded as a symptom of an underlying condition. Pain motivates the individual to withdraw from damaging situations, to protect a damaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar experiences in the future.

Porsche 944<====>24375<====>Porsche 944  The Porsche 944 is a sports car built by Porsche from 1982 to 1991.  A front-engined, rear-wheel drive mid-level model based on the 924 platform, the 944 was available in coupé or cabriolet body styles, with either naturally aspirated or turbocharged engines.  Intended to be produced into the 1990s, major revisions planned for a 944 "S3" model were eventually combined into the 968, which became its replacement.  Over 163,000 944s were produced, making it the most successful car line in Porsche history until the introductions of the Boxster and 997 Carrera. HistoryThe Porsche 924 had originally been a project of VW-Porsche a joint Porsche/Volkswagen company created to develop and produce the 914 which was sold in Europe as both a Porsche and a Volkswagen. 

Porsche 968<====>24376<====>Porsche 968  The Porsche 968 is a sports car made by Porsche AG from 1992 to 1995.  It was the final evolution of a line of water-cooled front-engined rear wheel drive models begun almost 20 years earlier with the 924, taking over the entry-level position in the company lineup from the 944 with which it shared about 20% of its parts.  The 968 was Porsche's last new front-engined vehicle before the introduction of the Cayenne SUV in 2003. HistoryPorsche's 944 model debuted for the 1982 model year, was updated as "944S" in 1987 and as "944S2" in 1989.

Most probably he was a deacon of the Roman Church and as such signed the decrees of the Roman council of 732 and succeeded Gregory III on 5 December 741.    Zachary built the original church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, forbade the traffic of slaves in Rome, and negotiated peace with the Lombards. 

Pope Valentine<====>24381<====>Pope Valentine  Pope Valentine (in Latin: Valentinus; d.  10 October 827) was Pope for two months in 827. BiographyBorn in Rome in the region of the Via Lata, Valentine was the son of a Roman noble called Leontius.   Showing an early aptitude for learning, he was moved from the school attached to the Lateran Palace and, according to the Liber Pontificalis, was made a Deacon by Pope Paschal I (817–824).    His biographer in the Liber pontificalis praises his piety and purity of morals, which won him the favor of Paschal I, who raised him to the rank of Archdeacon. 

Pope Victor I<====>24382<====>Pope Victor I  Pope Victor I (died 199) was Bishop of Rome, and hence a pope, in the late second century.  He was of Berber origin.    The dates of his tenure are uncertain, but one source states he became pope in 189 and gives the year of his death as 199.  Kirsch, Johann Peter (1912).  "Pope St.  Victor I" in The Catholic Encyclopedia.  Vol.  15.  New York: Robert Appleton Company.   He was the first bishop of Rome born in the Roman Province of Africa—probably in Leptis Magna (or Tripolitania). 

Pope Victor II<====>24383<====>Pope Victor IIPope Victor II (c.  1018 – 28 July 1057), born Gebhard, Count of Calw, Tollenstein, and Hirschberg , was Pope from 13 April 1055 until his death in 1057.   He was one of a series of German reform popes. LifeHe was born Gebhard of Calw, a son of the Swabian Count Hartwig of Calw and a kinsman of Emperor Henry III.  At the suggestion of his uncle, Gebhard, Bishop of Ratisbon, the 24-year-old Gebhard was appointed Bishop of Eichstätt.  In this position, he supported the Emperor's interests and eventually became one of his closest advisors. 

Pope Victor III<====>24384<====>Pope Victor III   Pope Victor III (c.  1026 – 16 September 1087), born Dauferio, was Pope from 24 May 1086 to his death in 1087.  He was the successor of Pope Gregory VII, yet his pontificate is far less impressive in history than his time as Desiderius, the great Abbot of Montecassino. His failing health was the factor that made him so reluctant to accept his pontifical election and his health was so poor that he fell to illness during his papal coronation.  The only literary work of his that remains is his "Dialogues" on the miracles performed by Saint Benedict of Nursia and other saints at Montecassino. 

Pribislav-Henry<====>24387<====>Pribislav-HenryPribislav-Henry ( ; d.  1150) was a Slavic Christian prince and the last ruler of the Hevelli (Stodorani) tribe in the Northern March of Brandenburg.His reign started, probably supported by the Ascanians, after the prior Hevelli prince Meinfried had been murdered in 1127.   Having no sons of his own, he around 1129 gave the area between Brandenburg and Lehnin to his son-in-law, who was the oldest son of Albert the Bear.   Emperor Lothair III approved the gift and made Albert margrave of the Northern March in 1134.   In 1150, Pribislav Henry died and was succeeded, after a short war of succession, by Albert the Bear. 

Political science<====>24388<====>Political science    Political science is a social science which deals with systems of governance, and the analysis of political activities, political thoughts and political behaviour.   It deals extensively with the theory and practice of politics which is commonly thought of as determining of the distribution of power and resources.  Political scientists "see themselves engaged in revealing the relationships underlying political events and conditions, and from these revelations they attempt to construct general principles about the way the world of politics works. "  Political science comprises numerous subfields, including comparative politics, political economy, international relations, political theory, public administration, public policy, and political methodology. 

Public relations<====>24389<====>Public relations   Public relations (PR) is the practice of managing the spread of information between an individual or an organization (such as a business, government agency, or a nonprofit organization) and the public.   Public relations may include an organization or individual gaining exposure to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment.   This differentiates it from advertising as a form of marketing communications.  Public relations is the idea of creating coverage for clients for free, rather than marketing or advertising.  An example of good public relations would be generating an article featuring a client, rather than paying for the client to be advertised next to the article. 

Paradox<====>24390<====>Paradox A paradox is a statement that, despite apparently sound reasoning from true premises, leads to an apparently self-contradictory or logically unacceptable conclusion.    A paradox involves contradictory yet interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time.    Some logical paradoxes are known to be invalid arguments but are still valuable in promoting critical thinking.  Some paradoxes have revealed errors in definitions assumed to be rigorous, and have caused axioms of mathematics and logic to be re-examined.  One example is Russell's paradox, which questions whether a "list of all lists that do not contain themselves" would include itself, and showed that attempts to found set theory on the identification of sets with properties or predicates were flawed. 

Parousia<====>24393<====>ParousiaParousia ( ;  ) is an ancient Greek word meaning presence, arrival, or official visit.   Classical usageFrom the Ptolemaic period to the second century of the common era "parousia' was used in the East as a technical expression to denote the arrival or visit of a king or emperor, and celebrated the glory of the sovereign publicly.  In memory of the visit of Emperor Nero to the cities of Patras and Corinth, advent coins were struck that carried the legend Adventus Augusti Corinth.  The Greek word parousia here corresponded to the Latin word advent.  The numerous journeyings of  the Emperor Hadrian were celebrated by many advent coins, and often new eras were reckoned from date of the parousia.

PDP-11<====>24399<====>PDP-11 The PDP-11 is a series of 16-bit minicomputers sold by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) from 1970 into the 1990s, one of a succession of products in the PDP series.  In total, around 600,000 PDP-11s of all models were sold, making it one of DEC's most successful product lines.  The PDP-11 is considered by some experts to be the most popular minicomputer ever. The PDP-11 included a number of innovative features in its instruction set and additional general-purpose registers that made it much easier to program than earlier models in the series.  Additionally, the innovative Unibus system allowed external devices to be easily interfaced to the system using direct memory access, opening the system to a wide variety of peripherals. 

Pair programming<====>24400<====>Pair programming Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation.  One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator,  reviews each line of code as it is typed in.  The two programmers switch roles frequently. While reviewing, the observer also considers the "strategic" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address.  This frees the driver to focus all of their attention on the "tactical" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide. 

Psychology of torture<====>24401<====>Psychology of torture  Torture is the use of physical and/or psychological pain to control the victim and/or fulfill some needs of the perpetrator.  The psychology of torture refers to the psychological processes underlying all aspects of torture including the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, the immediate and long-term effects, and the political and social institutions that influence its use. The perpetrator of tortureResearch during the past 60 years, starting with the Milgram experiment, suggests that under the right circumstances, and with the appropriate encouragement and setting, most people can be encouraged to actively torture others.  John Conroy: "When torture takes place, people believe they are on the high moral ground, that the nation is under threat and they are the front line protecting the nation, and people will be grateful for what they are doing. 

Pongo de Manseriche<====>24402<====>Pongo de Manseriche The Pongo de Manseriche is a gorge in northwest Peru.   The Marañón River runs through this gorge (and water gap) before it reaches the Amazon Basin. The Pongo de Manseriche is 3 miles (4. 8 km) long, located at 4° 27' 30" south latitude and 77° 34' 51" west longitude, just below the mouth of the Rio Santiago, and between it and the old missionary station of Borja. According to Captain Carvajal, who descended the Pongo in the little steamer Napo, in 1868, it is a vast rent in the Andes about 2000 ft (600 m) deep, narrowing in places to a width of only 100 ft (30 m), the precipices "seeming to close in at the top. 

Presbyterianism<====>24403<====>Presbyterianism    Presbyterianism is a part of the Reformed tradition within Protestantism which traces its origins to the British Isles, particularly Scotland. Presbyterian churches derive their name from the presbyterian form of church government, which is governed by representative assemblies of elders.  A great number of Reformed churches are organized this way, but the word Presbyterian, when capitalized, is often applied uniquely to churches that trace their roots to the Scottish and English Presbyterians, as well as several English dissenter groups that formed during the English Civil War.Presbyterian theology typically emphasizes the sovereignty of God, the authority of the Scriptures, and the necessity of grace through faith in Christ. 

Parliament<====>24406<====>ParliamentIn modern politics and history, a parliament is a legislative, elected body of government.  Generally, a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government via hearings and inquiries. Although some restrict the use of the word parliament to parliamentary systems, it is also commonly used to describe the legislature in presidential systems (e. g.  the French parliament), even where it is not in the official name. Historically, parliaments included various kinds of deliberative, consultative, and judicial assemblies, e. g.  mediaeval parlements. EtymologyThe English term is derived from Anglo-Norman and dates to the 14th century, coming from the 11th century Old French  , from parler, meaning "to talk". 

Polar bear<====>24408<====>Polar bearThe polar bear (   ) is a carnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses.  It is a large bear, approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi).   A boar (adult male) weighs around  ,    while a sow (adult female) is about half that size.  Although it is the sister species of the brown bear,    it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet.

Punic Wars<====>24417<====>Punic Wars The Punic Wars were a series of three wars fought between Rome and Carthage from 264 BC to 146 BC.   At the time, they were some of the largest wars that had ever taken place.   The term Punic comes from the Latin word Punicus (or Poenicus), meaning "Carthaginian", with reference to the Carthaginians' Phoenician ancestry.  The main cause of the Punic Wars was the conflicts of interest between the existing Carthaginian Empire and the expanding Roman Republic.  The Romans were initially interested in expansion via Sicily (which at that time was a cultural melting pot), part of which lay under Carthaginian control.

Punched card<====>24420<====>Punched card A punched card or punch card is a piece of stiff paper that can be used to contain digital information represented by the presence or absence of holes in predefined positions.  The information might be data for data processing applications or, in earlier examples, used to directly control automated machinery.    Punched cards were widely used through much of the 20th century in what became known as the data processing industry, where specialized and increasingly complex unit record machines, organized into semiautomatic data processing systems, used punched cards for data input, output, and storage.Many early digital computers used punched cards, often prepared using keypunch machines, as the primary medium for input of both computer programs and data.

Other common colour encoding systems are NTSC and SECAM. All the countries using PAL are currently in process of conversion or have already converted standards to DVB, ISDB or DTMB. This page primarily discusses the PAL colour encoding system.  The articles on broadcast television systems and analogue television further describe frame rates, image resolution and audio modulation. HistoryIn the 1950s, the Western European countries commenced planning to introduce colour television, and were faced with the problem that the NTSC standard demonstrated several weaknesses, including colour tone shifting under poor transmission conditions, which became a major issue considering Europe's geographical and weather-related particularities. 

Polo<====>24443<====>PoloPolo is a team sport played on horseback.  The objective is to score goals against an opposing team.  Players score by driving a small hard white ball into the opposing team's goal using a long-handled wooden mallet.  The modern sport of polo is played on a grass field of   .  Each polo team consists of four riders and their polo ponies. Arena polo has three players per team and the game usually involves more maneuvering and shorter plays at lower speeds due to space limitations of arenas.  Arena polo is played with a small air-filled ball, similar to a small football. 

Page description language<====>24444<====>Page description languageIn digital printing, a page description language (PDL) is a computer language that describes the appearance of a printed page in a higher level than an actual output bitmap.  An overlapping term is printer control language, which includes Hewlett-Packard's Printer Command Language (PCL).  PostScript is one of the most noted page description languages.  The markup language adaptation of the PDL is the page description markup language. Page description languages are text (human-readable) or binary data streams, usually intermixed with text or graphics to be printed.  They are distinct from graphics application programming interfaces (APIs) such as GDI and OpenGL that can be called by software to generate graphical output. 

Pope Felix I<====>24445<====>Pope Felix I  Pope Felix I (died 30 December 274) was the Bishop of Rome or Pope from 5 January 269 to his death in 274. Life and worksA Roman by birth, Annuario Pontificio 2012 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2008  ), p.  8*  Felix was chosen as Pope on 5 January 269,  in succession to Pope Dionysius, who had died on 26 December 268.  Felix was the author of an important dogmatic letter on the unity of Christ's Person.  He received the emperor Aurelian's aid in settling a theological dispute between the anti-Trinitarian Paul of Samosata,  who had been deprived of the bishopric  Antioch by a council of bishops for heresy and the orthodox Domnus, Paul's successor. 

Peptide bond<====>24446<====>Peptide bondA peptide bond, also known as an amide bond, is a covalent chemical bond linking two consecutive amino acid monomers along a peptide or protein chain.   SynthesisWhen two amino acids form a dipeptide through a peptide bond it is called  condensation.  In condensation, two amino acids approach each other, with the acid moiety of one coming near the amino moiety of the other.  One loses a hydrogen and oxygen from its carboxyl group (COOH) and the other loses a hydrogen from its amino group (NH 2 ).  This reaction produces a molecule of water (H 2 O) and two amino acids joined by a peptide bond (-CO-NH-). 

Pumping lemma<====>24449<====>Pumping lemmaIn the theory of formal languages, the pumping lemma may refer to:Pumping lemma for regular languages, the fact that all sufficiently long strings in such a language have a substring that can be repeated arbitrarily many times, usually used to prove that certain languages are not regularPumping lemma for context-free languages, the fact that all sufficiently long strings in such a language have a pair of substrings that can be repeated arbitrarily many times, usually used to prove that certain languages are not context-freePumping lemma for indexed languagesPumping lemma for regular tree languagesSee alsoOgden's lemma, a stronger version of the pumping lemma for context-free languages 

Privy Council of the United Kingdom<====>24451<====>Privy Council of the United Kingdom    Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, usually known simply as the Privy Council, is a formal body of advisers to the Sovereign of the United Kingdom.  Its membership mainly comprises senior politicians, who are current or former members of either the House of Commons or the House of Lords. The Privy Council formally advises the sovereign on the exercise of the Royal Prerogative, and corporately (as Queen-in-Council) it issues executive instruments known as Orders in Council, which among other powers enact Acts of Parliament.  The Council also holds the delegated authority to issue Orders of Council, mostly used to regulate certain public institutions. 

Prime Minister of India<====>24452<====>Prime Minister of India    The Prime Minister of India is the leader of the executive branch of the Government of India.  The Prime Minister is also the chief adviser to the President of India and head of the Council of Ministers.  They can be a member of any of the two houses of Parliament (the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha), but has to be a member of the political party, having a majority in the Lok Sabha. The Prime Minister is the senior member of cabinet in the executive branch of government in a parliamentary system. 

Paraphyly<====>24454<====>Paraphyly  In taxonomy, a group is paraphyletic if it consists of the group's last common ancestor and  all descendants of that ancestor excluding a few—typically only one or two—monophyletic subgroups.  The group is said to be paraphyletic with respect to the excluded subgroups.  The arrangement of the members of a paraphyletic group is called a paraphyly.  The term is commonly used in phylogenetics (a subfield of biology) and in linguistics.  The term was coined to apply to well-known taxa like Reptilia (reptiles) which, as commonly named and traditionally defined, is paraphyletic with respect to mammals and birds. 

Pope Innocent III<====>24455<====>Pope Innocent III   Pope Innocent III ( ; 1160 or 1161 – 16 July 1216) reigned from 8 January 1198 to his death in 1216.  His birth name was Lotario dei Conti di Segni, sometimes anglicised to Lothar of Segni. Pope Innocent was one of the most powerful and influential popes.  He exerted a wide influence over the Christian states of Europe, claiming supremacy over all of Europe's kings.  Pope Innocent was central in supporting the Catholic Church's reforms of ecclesiastical affairs through his decretals and the Fourth Lateran Council.  This resulted in a considerable refinement of Western canon law.

PVC comes in two basic forms: rigid (sometimes abbreviated as RPVC) and flexible.  The rigid form of PVC is used in construction for pipe and in profile applications such as doors and windows. 

Profession<====>24460<====>Profession A profession is a vocation founded upon specialized educational training, the purpose of which is to supply disinterested objective counsel and service to others, for a direct and definite compensation, wholly apart from expectation of other business gain.   The term is a truncation of the term "liberal profession", which is, in turn, an Anglicization of the French term "profession libérale".  Originally borrowed by English users in the 19th century, it has been re-borrowed by international users from the late 20th, though the (upper-middle) class overtones of the term do not seem to survive retranslation: "liberal professions" are, according to the European Union's Directive on Recognition of Professional Qualifications (2005/36/EC) "those practiced on the basis of relevant professional qualifications in a personal, responsible and professionally independent capacity by those providing intellectual and conceptual services in the interest of the client and the public". 

Philip Henry Gosse<====>24464<====>Philip Henry Gosse   Philip Henry Gosse ( ; 6 April 1810 – 23 August 1888), known to his friends as Henry,  was an English naturalist and popularizer of natural science, virtually the inventor of the seawater aquarium, and a painstaking innovator in the study of marine biology.  The aquarium craze was launched in early Victorian England by Gosse who created and stocked the first public aquarium at the London Zoo in 1853, and coined the term "aquarium" when he published the first manual, The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea, in 1854.

President of the European Commission<====>24468<====>President of the European Commission   The President of the European Commission is the head of the European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union.   The President of the Commission leads a cabinet of Commissioners, referred to as the college, collectively accountable to the European Parliament, which is directly elected by EU citizens.  The President is empowered to allocate portfolios amongst, reshuffle or dismiss Commissioners as necessary.  The college directs the Commission's civil service, sets the policy agenda and determines the legislative proposals it produces (the Commission is the only body that can propose  EU laws). 

Phonograph<====>24471<====>Phonograph   The phonograph is a device, invented in 1877, for the mechanical recording and reproduction of sound.  In its later forms, it is also called a gramophone (as a trademark since 1887, as a generic name in the UK since 1910), or, since the 1940s, a record player.  The sound vibration waveforms are recorded as corresponding physical deviations of a spiral groove engraved, etched, incised, or impressed into the surface of a rotating cylinder or disc, called a "record".  To recreate the sound, the surface is similarly rotated while a playback stylus traces the groove and is therefore vibrated by it, very faintly reproducing the recorded sound. 

Paul Cézanne<====>24472<====>Paul Cézanne   Paul Cézanne (  or  ;  ; 19 January 1839 – 22 October 1906)  was a French artist and Post-Impressionist painter whose work laid the foundations of the transition from the 19th-century conception of artistic endeavor to a new and radically different world of art in the 20th century.  Cézanne's often repetitive, exploratory brushstrokes are highly characteristic and clearly recognizable.  He used planes of colour and small brushstrokes that build up to form complex fields.  The paintings convey Cézanne's intense study of his subjects. Cézanne is said to have formed the bridge between late 19th-century Impressionism and the early 20th century's new line of artistic enquiry, Cubism. 

Pope Innocent VI<====>24473<====>Pope Innocent VI   Pope Innocent VI ( ; 1282 or 1295 – 12 September 1362), born Étienne Aubert, was Pope from 18 December 1352 to his death in 1362.  He was the fifth Avignon Pope. Early lifeÉtienne's father was Adhemar Aubert (1260-?), seigneur de Montel-de-Gelat in Limousin province.   He was a native of the hamlet of Les Monts, Diocese of Limoges    (today part of the commune of Beyssac, département of Corrèze), and, after having taught civil law at Toulouse, he became successively Bishop of Noyon in 1338 and Bishop of Clermont in 1340. 

Polyandry<====>24474<====>Polyandry    Polyandry ( ; from   poly-, "many" and ἀνήρ anēr, "man") is a form of polygamy in which a woman takes two or more husbands at the same time.  Polyandry is contrasted with polygyny, involving one male and two or more females.  If a marriage involves a plural number of "husbands and wives" participants of each gender, then it can be called polyamory,  group or conjoint marriage.In its broadest use, polyandry refers to sexual relations with multiple males within or without marriage. Of the 1,231 societies listed in the 1980 Ethnographic Atlas, 186 were found to be monogamous; 453 had occasional polygyny; 588 had more frequent polygyny; and 4 had polyandry. 

Polygamy<====>24475<====>PolygamyPolygamy (from Late Greek  , polygamía, "state of marriage to many spouses")   is the practice of marrying multiple spouses.  When a man is married to more than one wife at a time, sociologists call this polygyny.  When a woman is married to more than one husband at a time, it is called polyandry.  If a marriage includes multiple husbands and wives, it can be called a group marriage. In contrast, monogamy is marriage consisting of only two parties.  Like "monogamy", the term "polygamy" is often used in a de facto sense, applied regardless of whether the state recognises the relationship. 

Postscript<====>24478<====>Postscript  A postscript (P. S. ) is an afterthought, thought of occurring after the letter has been written and signed.   The term comes from the Latin postscriptum, an expression meaning "written after"   (which may be interpreted in the sense of "that which comes after the writing").  A postscript may be a sentence, a paragraph, or occasionally many paragraphs added, often hastily and incidentally, after the signature of a letter or (sometimes) the main body of an essay or book.  In a book or essay, a more carefully composed addition (e. g. , for a second edition) is called an afterword. 

Penectomy<====>24479<====>Penectomy   Penectomy is penis removal through surgery, generally for medical or personal reasons. Medical reasons for penectomyCancer, for example, sometimes necessitates removal of part or all of the penis.The amount of penis removed depends on the severity of the cancer.  Some men have only the tip of their penis removed.  For others with more advanced cancer, the entire penis must be removed.    In rare instances, botched circumcisions have also resulted in full or partial penectomies, as with David Reimer. Fournier gangrene can also be a reason for penectomy and/or orchiectomy. 

Provirus<====>24481<====>ProvirusA provirus is a virus genome that is integrated into the DNA of a host cell.  In the case of bacterial viruses (bacteriophages), proviruses are often referred to as prophages. This state can be a stage of virus replication, or a state that persists over longer periods of time as either inactive viral infections or an endogenous viral element.  In inactive viral infections the virus will not replicate itself but through replication of its host cell.  This state can last over many host cell generations. Endogenous retroviruses are always in the state of a provirus.  When a (nonendogenous) retrovirus invades a cell, the RNA of the retrovirus is reverse-transcribed into DNA by reverse transcriptase, then inserted into the host genome by an integrase. 

Parade<====>24484<====>Parade  A parade (also called march or marchpast) is a procession of people, usually organized along a street, often in costume, and often accompanied by marching bands, floats or sometimes large balloons.  Parades are held for a wide range of reasons, but are usually celebrations of some kind.  In Britain the term parade is usually reserved for either military parades or other occasions where participants march in formation; for celebratory occasions the word procession is more usual.  In the Canadian Forces the term also has several less formal connotations.  Protest demonstrations can also take the form of a parade, but such cases are usually referred to as a march instead. 

Priority queue<====>24485<====>Priority queue In  computer science, a priority queue is an abstract data type which is like a regular queue or stack data structure, but where additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it.  In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority.  If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue. While priority queues are often implemented with heaps, they are conceptually distinct from heaps.  A priority queue is an abstract concept like "a list" or "a map"; just as a list can be implemented with a linked list or an array, a priority queue can be implemented with a heap or a variety of other methods such as an unordered array. 

Pāramitā<====>24487<====>Pāramitā    Pāramitā (Sanskrit, Pali) or pāramī (Pāli) is "perfection" or "completeness".  While, technically, pāramī and pāramitā are both Pāli terms, Pali literature makes far greater reference to pāramī. EtymologyDonald S.  Lopez, Jr.  describes the etymology of the term: Theravāda BuddhismTheravada teachings on the pāramīs can be found in late canonical books and post-canonical commentaries. Canonical sourcesIn the Pāli Canon, the Buddhavaṃsa lists the ten perfections (dasa pāramiyo) as: Dāna pāramī : generosity, giving of oneselfSīla pāramī : virtue, morality, proper conductNekkhamma pāramī : renunciationPaññā pāramī : transcendental wisdom, insightViriya pāramī : energy, diligence, vigour, effortKhanti pāramī : patience, tolerance, forbearance, acceptance, enduranceSacca pāramī : truthfulness, honestyAdhiṭṭhāna pāramī : determination, resolutionMettā pāramī : loving-kindnessUpekkhā pāramī : equanimity, serenityTwo of the above virtues, mettā and upekkhā, also are brahmavihāras.

Prakrit<====>24497<====>Prakrit   The Prakrits (   ,  ,  ) are any of several Middle Indo-Aryan languages.The Ardhamagadhi (or simply Magadhi) Prakrit, which was used extensively to write the scriptures of Jainism, is often considered to be the definitive form of Prakrit, while others are considered variants thereof.  Prakrit grammarians would give the full grammar of Ardhamagadhi first, and then define the other grammars with relation to it.  For this reason, courses teaching 'Prakrit' are often regarded as teaching Ardhamagadhi.   Pali, the Prakrit used in Theravada Buddhism, tends to be treated as a special exception from the variants of the Ardhamagadhi language, as Classical Sanskrit grammars do not consider it as a Prakrit per se, presumably for sectarian rather than linguistic reasons. 

Progressive music<====>24501<====>Progressive music  Progressive music is music that subverts genre and results in the expansion of stylistic boundaries.   The word "progressive" comes from the basic concept of "progress", which refers to development and growth by accumulation,  and is often deployed in numerous music genres such as progressive country, progressive folk, progressive jazz, and (most significantly) progressive rock.   Musical progressiveness is typically achieved through synthesizing music from various cultural domains, such as European art music, Celtic folk, West Indian, or African.    As an art theory, the progressive approach falls between formalism and eclecticism. 

Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky<====>24503<====>Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky    Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (;   ;  ; often "Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky" in English.  His names are also transliterated "Piotr" or "Petr"; "Ilitsch", "Il'ich" or "Illyich"; and "Tschaikowski", "Tschaikowsky", "Chajkovskij" and "Chaikovsky" (and other versions; the transliteration varies among languages).  The Library of Congress standardized the usage Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky.   25 April/7 May 1840 – 25 October/6 November 1893), Russia was still using old style dates in the 19th century, rendering his lifespan as 25 April 1840 – 25 October 1893.  Some sources in the article report dates as old style rather than new style. 

Phospholipid<====>24505<====>PhospholipidPhospholipids are a class of lipids that are a major component of all cell membranes.  They can form lipid bilayers because of their amphiphilic characteristic.  The structure of the phospholipid molecule generally consists of two hydrophobic fatty acid "tails" and a hydrophilic "head" consisting of a phosphate group.   The two components are joined together by a glycerol molecule.  The phosphate groups can be modified with simple organic molecules such as choline. The first phospholipid identified in 1847 as such in biological tissues was lecithin, or phosphatidylcholine, in the egg yolk of chickens by the French chemist and pharmacist, Theodore Nicolas Gobley. 

Pierre Trudeau<====>24507<====>Pierre Trudeau   Joseph Philippe Pierre Yves Elliott Trudeau,   ( ;  ; October 18, 1919 – September 28, 2000), often referred to by the initials PET,was a Canadian statesman who served as the 15th Prime Minister of Canada (1968–1979 and 1980–1984).  He is the third longest-serving Prime Minister in Canadian history (behind William Lyon Mackenzie King and John A.  Macdonald), having served for 15 years, 164 days. Trudeau rose to prominence as a lawyer, intellectual, and activist in Quebec politics.  In the 1960s he entered federal politics by joining the Liberal Party of Canada. 

Pencil<====>24508<====>Pencil    A pencil is a writing implement or art medium constructed of a narrow, solid pigment core inside a protective casing which prevents the core from being broken and/or from  leaving marks on the user’s hand during use. Pencils create marks by physical abrasion, leaving behind a trail of solid core material that adheres to a sheet of paper or other surface.  They are distinct from pens, which instead disperse a trail of liquid or gel ink that stains the light colour of the paper by absorption. Most pencil cores are made of graphite mixed with a clay binder which leaves grey or black marks that can be easily erased. 

Pierre Curie<====>24509<====>Pierre Curie  Pierre Curie ( ;   ; 15 May 1859 – 19 April 1906) was a French physicist, a pioneer in crystallography, magnetism, piezoelectricity and radioactivity.  In 1903 he received the Nobel Prize in Physics with his wife, Marie Skłodowska-Curie, and Henri Becquerel, "in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel".    Early lifeBorn in Paris on 15 May 1859, Pierre Curie was the son of Eugène Curie (28 August 1827 – 25 February 1910) and Sophie-Claire Depouilly Curie (15 January 1832 – 27 September 1897). 

Pushdown automaton<====>24510<====>Pushdown automaton In computer science, a pushdown automaton (PDA) is   a type of automaton that employs a stack. Pushdown automata are used in theories about what can be computed by machines.  They are more capable than finite-state machines but less capable than Turing machines. Deterministic pushdown automata can recognize all deterministic context-free languages while nondeterministic ones can recognize all context-free languages, with the former often used in parser design. The term "pushdown" refers to the fact that the stack can be regarded as being "pushed down" like a tray dispenser at a cafeteria, since the operations never work on elements other than the top element. 

Protein primary structure<====>24511<====>Protein primary structure Protein primary structure is the linear sequence of amino acids in a peptide or protein.By convention, the primary structure of a protein is reported starting from the amino-terminal (N) end to the carboxyl-terminal (C) end.  Protein biosynthesis is most commonly performed by ribosomes in cells.  Peptides can also be synthesized in the laboratory .  Protein primary structures can be directly sequenced, or inferred from DNA sequences. FormationBiological Amino acids are polymerised via peptide bonds to form a long backbone, with the different amino acid side chains protruding along it. 

Peter principle<====>24512<====>Peter principle  The Peter principle is a concept in management theory formulated by educator Laurence J.  Peter and published in 1969.  It states that the selection of a candidate for a position is based on the candidate's performance in their current role, rather than on abilities relevant to the intended role.  Thus, employees only stop being promoted once they can no longer perform effectively, and "managers rise to the level of their incompetence". OverviewThe Peter principle is a special case of a ubiquitous observation: Anything that works will be used in progressively more challenging applications until it fails. 

Platonic realism<====>24513<====>Platonic realism  Platonic realism is a philosophical term usually used to refer to the idea of realism regarding the existence of universals or abstract objects after the Greek philosopher Plato (c.  427–c.  347 BC), a student of Socrates.  As universals were considered by Plato to be ideal forms, this stance is ambiguously also called Platonic idealism.  This should not be confused with idealism as presented by philosophers such as George Berkeley: as Platonic abstractions are not spatial, temporal, or mental, they are not compatible with the later idealism's emphasis on mental existence.  Plato's Forms include numbers and geometrical figures, making them a theory of mathematical realism; they also include the Form of the Good, making them in addition a theory of ethical realism. 

Psychosis<====>24514<====>Psychosis  Psychosis is an abnormal condition of the mind that involves a loss of contact with reality.  People experiencing psychosis may exhibit personality changes and thought disorder.  Depending on its severity, this may be accompanied by unusual or bizarre behavior, as well as difficulty with social interaction and impairment in carrying out daily life activities. Psychosis as a sign of a psychiatric disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion.  That is, a new-onset episode of psychosis is not considered a symptom of a psychiatric disorder until other relevant and known causes of psychosis are properly excluded.Medical and biological laboratory tests should exclude central nervous system diseases and injuries, diseases and injuries of other organs, psychoactive substances, and toxins as causes of symptoms of psychosis before any psychiatric illness can be diagnosed. 

Paranoia<====>24515<====>Paranoia   Paranoia is an instinct or thought process believed to be heavily influenced by anxiety or fear, often to the point of delusion and irrationality.   Paranoid thinking typically includes persecutory, or beliefs of   concerning a perceived threat towards oneself (e. g.  "Everyone is out to get me", which is an American parochial phrase).  Paranoia is distinct from phobias, which also involve irrational fear, but usually no blame.  Making false accusations and the general distrust of others also frequently accompany paranoia.  For example, an incident most people would view as an accident or coincidence, a paranoid person might believe was intentional. 

Polybius<====>24516<====>Polybius  Polybius ( ;  , Polýbios;   –   BC) was a Greek historian of the Hellenistic period noted for his work,   which covered the period of 264–146 BC in detail.  The work describes the rise of the Roman Republic to the status of dominance in the ancient Mediterranean world and includes his eyewitness account of the Sack of Carthage in 146 BC.  Polybius is important for his analysis of the mixed constitution or the separation of powers in government, which was influential on Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws and the framers of the United States Constitution. 

Plutarch<====>24517<====>Plutarch   Plutarch ( ;  , Ploútarkhos,  ; c.  AD 46 – AD 120),  later named, upon becoming a Roman citizen, Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus, ( )  was a Greek biographer and essayist, known primarily for his Parallel Lives and Moralia.    He is classified  as a Middle Platonist.   Plutarch's surviving works were written in Greek, but intended for both Greek and Roman readers.    LifeEarly lifePlutarch was born to a prominent family in the small town of Chaeronea, about 80 km (50 miles) east of Delphi, in the Greek region of Boeotia. 

Peter Sellers<====>24518<====>Peter Sellers  Peter Sellers, CBE (born Richard Henry Sellers; 8 September 1925 – 24 July 1980) was an English film actor, comedian and singer.  He performed in the BBC Radio comedy series The Goon Show, featured on a number of hit comic songs and became known to a worldwide audience through his many film characterisations, among them Chief Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther series of films. Born in Portsmouth, Sellers made his stage debut at the Kings Theatre, Southsea, when he was two weeks old.  He began accompanying his parents in a variety act that toured the provincial theatres. 

Project Runeberg<====>24519<====>Project Runeberg   Project Runeberg (Swedish, Projekt Runeberg) is a digital cultural archive initiative that publishes free electronic versions of books significant to the culture and history of the Nordic countries.  Patterned after Project Gutenberg, it was founded by Lars Aronsson and colleagues at Linköping University and began archiving Nordic-language literature in December 1992.  As of 2015 it had accomplished digitization to provide graphical facsimiles of old works such as the Nordisk familjebok, and had accomplished, in whole or in part, the text extractions and copyediting of these as well as esteemed Latin works and English translations from Nordic authors, and sheet music and other texts of cultural interest. 

Pico (text editor)<====>24521<====>Pico (text editor) Pico (Pine composer) is a text editor for Unix and Unix-based computer systems.  It is integrated with the Pine e-mail client, which was designed by the Office of Computing and Communications at the University of Washington. From the Pine FAQ: "Pine's message composition editor is also available as a separate stand-alone program, called PICO.  PICO is a very simple and easy-to-use text editor offering paragraph justification, cut/paste, and a spelling checker. . . ".  Pico does not support working with several files simultaneously and cannot perform a find and replace across multiple files.  It also cannot copy text from one file to another (though it is possible to read text into the editor from a file in its working directory). 

Power law<====>24522<====>Power law  In statistics, a power law is a functional relationship between two quantities, where a relative change in one quantity results in a proportional relative change in the other quantity, independent of the initial size of those quantities: one quantity varies as a power of another.  For instance, considering the area of a square in terms of the length of its side, if the length is doubled, the area is multiplied by a factor of four.  Empirical examplesThe distributions of a wide variety of physical, biological, and man-made phenomena approximately follow a power law over a wide range of magnitudes: these include the sizes of craters on the moon and of solar flares,  the foraging pattern of various species,    the sizes of activity patterns of neuronal populations,    the frequencies of words in most languages, frequencies of family names, the species richness in clades of organisms,  the sizes of power outages, criminal charges per convict, volcanic eruptions,  and many other quantities. 

PH<====>24530<====>PHIn chemistry, pH ( ) (potential of hydrogen) is a numeric scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution.   It is approximately the negative of the base 10 logarithm of the molar concentration, measured in units of moles per liter, of hydrogen ions.  More precisely it is the negative of the base 10 logarithm of the activity of the hydrogen ion.  Bates, Roger G.  Determination of pH: theory and practice.  Wiley, 1973.   Solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. 

Pastel<====>24533<====>Pastel   A pastel ( UK:   ;  US:   ) is an art medium in the form of a stick, consisting of pure powdered pigment and a binder.  The pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all colored art media, including oil paints; the binder is of a neutral hue and low saturation.  The color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process.  Pastels have been used by artists since the Renaissance, and gained considerable popularity in the 18th century, when a number of notable artists made pastel their primary medium. 

Pen pal<====>24537<====>Pen pal  Pen pals (or penpals, pen-pals, penfriends or pen friends) are people who regularly write to each other, particularly via postal mail. PurposesA penpal relationship is often used to practice reading and writing in a foreign language, to improve literacy, to learn more about other countries and life-styles, and to make friendships.  As with any friendships in life, some people remain penpals for only a short time, while others continue to exchange letters and presents for life.  Some penpals eventually arrange to meet face to face; sometimes leading to serious relationships, or even marriage. Penpals come in all ages, nationalities, cultures, languages and interests. 

Philip Glass<====>24540<====>Philip Glass  Philip Morris Glass (born January 31, 1937)  is an American composer.  He is widely regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the late 20th century.    Glass's compositions have been described as minimal music, similar to other "minimalist" composers including La Monte Young, Steve Reich and Terry Riley.However, Glass has described himself instead as a composer of "music with repetitive structures",    which he has helped evolve stylistically.Glass founded the Philip Glass Ensemble, with which he still performs on keyboards. 

Phenotype<====>24543<====>Phenotype  A phenotype ( ) is the composite of an organism's observable characteristics or traits, such as its morphology, development, biochemical or physiological properties, behavior, and products of behavior (such as a bird's nest).  A phenotype results from the expression of an organism's genetic code, its genotype, as well as the influence of environmental factors and the interactions between the two.  When two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same population of a species, the species is called polymorphic.  A well-documented polymorphism is Labrador Retriever coloring; while the coat color depends on many genes, it is clearly seen in the environment as yellow, black and brown. 

Photosynthesis<====>24544<====>Photosynthesis Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms' activities (energy transformation).  This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water – hence the name photosynthesis, from the Greek  , phōs, "light", and  , synthesis, "putting together". In most cases, oxygen is also released as a waste product.  Most plants, most algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. 

Pasporta Servo<====>24545<====>Pasporta Servo   The Pasporta Servo ( ) is an international hospitality service for Esperanto speakers.  The website provides a platform for members to homestay as a guest at someone's home, host travelers, meet other members, or join an event.  Pasporta Servo is an example of the gift economy; there is no monetary exchange between members and there is no expectation by hosts for future rewards.  Free lodging via Pasporta Servo has been described as one of the perks of learning Esperanto.  How it worksUser directoryThe service publishes a directory of people from countries on every continent who are willing to host other Esperanto speakers in their homes free. 

Pierre-Auguste Renoir<====>24546<====>Pierre-Auguste RenoirPierre-Auguste Renoir, commonly known as Auguste Renoir (  or  ;  ; 25 February 1841 – 3 December 1919), was a French artist who was a leading painter in the development of the Impressionist style.  As a celebrator of beauty and especially feminine sensuality, it has been said that "Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from Rubens to Watteau. " He was the father of actor Pierre Renoir (1885–1952), filmmaker Jean Renoir (1894–1979) and ceramic artist Claude Renoir (1901–1969).  He was the grandfather of the filmmaker Claude Renoir (1913–1993), son of Pierre. 

Poll tax<====>24547<====>Poll tax   A poll tax, also known as head tax or capitation, is a tax levied as a fixed sum on every liable individual.   Head taxes were important sources of revenue for many governments from ancient times until the 19th century.  In the United Kingdom, poll taxes were levied by the governments of John of Gaunt in the 14th century, Charles II in the 17th and Margaret Thatcher in the 20th century.  In the United States, voting poll taxes have been used to disenfranchise minority voters (especially under Reconstruction). The word "poll" is an archaic term for "head" or "top of the head". 

Patriotism<====>24552<====>Patriotism    Patriotism is the ideology of attachment to a homeland.  This attachment can be a combination of many different features relating to one's own homeland, including ethnic, cultural, political or historical aspects.  It encompasses a set of concepts closely related to those of nationalism.  An excess of patriotism in the defense of a nation is called chauvinism; another related term is jingoism. The English term patriot is first attested in the Elizabethan era, via Middle French from Late Latin (6th century) patriota, meaning "countryman", ultimately  ,  . 

Protein biosynthesis<====>24553<====>Protein biosynthesisProtein synthesis is the process whereby biological cells generate new proteins; it is balanced by the loss of cellular proteins via degradation or export.  Translation, the assembly of amino acids by ribosomes, is an essential part of the biosynthetic pathway, along with generation of messenger RNA (mRNA), aminoacylation of transfer RNA (tRNA), co-translational transport, and post-translational modification.  Protein biosynthesis is strictly regulated at multiple steps.   They are principally during transcription (phenomena of RNA synthesis from DNA template) and translation (phenomena of amino acid assembly from RNA). The cistron DNA is transcribed into the first of a series  of RNA intermediates. 

Photosynthetic pigment<====>24555<====>Photosynthetic pigment A photosynthetic pigment (accessory pigment; chloroplast pigment; antenna pigment) is a pigment that is present in chloroplasts or photosynthetic bacteria and captures the light energy necessary for photosynthesis. PlantsGreen plants have six closely related photosynthetic pigments (in order of increasing polarity):Carotene - an orange pigmentXanthophyll - a yellow pigmentPhaeophytin a CHLOROPHYLLS, JECFA, 1987  - a gray-brown pigmentPhaeophytin b  - a yellow-brown pigmentChlorophyll a - a blue-green pigmentChlorophyll b - a yellow-green pigmentChlorophyll a is the most common of the six, present in every plant that performs photosynthesis.  The reason that there are so many pigments is that each absorbs light more efficiently in a different part of the electromagnetic spectrum. 

Peter J. Carroll<====>24557<====>Peter J.  Carroll Peter James Carroll (born 8 January 1953, in Patching, England) is a modern occultist, author, cofounder of the Illuminates of Thanateros, and practitioner of chaos magic theory.  Early lifeCarroll studied science at the University of London and graduated with a "precisely calculated minimum pass".After university, Carroll was employed as a school teacher, and spent four years in India and the Himalayas.  CareerCarroll's 1987 book Liber Null & Psychonaut is considered one of the defining works of the chaos magic movement.   Carroll was a co-founder of the loosely organized group called the Illuminates of Thanateros. 

Intact dilation and extraction<====>24560<====>Intact dilation and extraction Intact dilation and extraction (Intact D&E) is a surgical procedure that removes an intact fetus from the uterus.  The procedure is used both after late-term miscarriages and in late-term abortions. It is also known as intact dilation and evacuation, dilation and extraction (D&X, or DNX, disfavored term), and, in United States federal law, as partial-birth abortion.  Gonzales v.  Carhart, 550 U. S.   (2007).  Findlaw. com.  Retrieved 2007-04-30.  In 2000, although only 0. 17% (2,232 of 1,313,000) of all abortions in the United States were performed using this procedure,  it has developed into a focal point of the abortion debate. 

Plutocracy<====>24561<====>Plutocracy   Plutocracy ( ,  , 'wealth' +  ,  , 'rule') or plutarchy, is a form of oligarchy and defines a society ruled or controlled by the small minority of the wealthiest citizens.  The first known use of the term was in 1631.    Unlike systems such as democracy, capitalism, socialism or anarchism, plutocracy is not rooted in an established political philosophy.  The concept of plutocracy may be advocated by the wealthy classes of a society in an indirect or surreptitious fashion, though the term itself is almost always used in a pejorative sense. 

Pareto principle<====>24562<====>Pareto principle The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity)  states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.Management consultant Joseph M.  Juran suggested the principle and named it after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who noted the 80/20 connection while at the University of Lausanne in 1896, as published in his first paper, "Cours d'économie politique".  Essentially, Pareto showed that approximately 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population. 

Prefix<====>24564<====>Prefix  A prefix is an affix which is placed before the stem of a word.   Adding it to the beginning of one word changes it into another word.  For example, when the prefix un- is added to the word happy, it creates the word unhappy.  Particularly in the study of languages, a prefix is also called a preformative, because it alters the form of the words to which it is affixed. Prefixes, like other affixes, can be either inflectional, creating a new form of the word with the same basic meaning and same lexical category (but playing a different role in the sentence), or derivational, creating a new word with a new semantic meaning and sometimes also a different lexical category. 

Pope Anterus<====>24565<====>Pope Anterus Pope Anterus (died 3 January 236) was the Bishop of Rome from 21 November 235 to his death in 236.  Shahan, Thomas (1907).  "Pope St.  Anterus" in The Catholic Encyclopedia.  Vol.  1.  New York: Robert Appleton Company.

Palaeography<====>24566<====>Palaeography Palaeography (UK) or paleography (US; ultimately from  , palaiós, "old", and  , graphein, "to write") is the study of ancient and historical handwriting (that is to say, of the forms and processes of writing, not the textual content of documents).  Included in the discipline is the practice of deciphering, reading, and dating historical manuscripts,  and the cultural context of writing, including the methods with which writing and books were produced, and the history of scriptoria.  The discipline is important for understanding, authenticating, and dating ancient texts.  However, it cannot in general be used to pinpoint dates with high precision. 

Pollutant<====>24567<====>PollutantA pollutant is a substance or energy introduced into the environment that has undesired effects, or adversely affects the usefulness of a resource.  A pollutant may cause long- or short-term damage by changing the growth rate of plant or animal species, or by interfering with human amenities, comfort, health, or property values.  Some pollutants are biodegradable and therefore will not persist in the environment in the long term.  However, the degradation products of some pollutants are themselves polluting such as the products DDE and DDD produced from degradation of DDT. Different types of pollutants in natureStock pollutantsPollutants, towards which the environment has little or no absorptive capacity are called stock pollutants. 

Pepsi<====>24573<====>Pepsi    Pepsi is a carbonated soft drink produced and manufactured by PepsiCo.  Originally created and developed in 1893 by Caleb Bradham and introduced as Brad's Drink, it was renamed as Pepsi-Cola on August 28, 1898, and then as Pepsi in 1961.  The History of Pepsi-Cola, Soda Museum, LLC HistoryThe drink Pepsi was first introduced as "Brad's Drink"  in New Bern, North Carolina, United States, in 1893 by Caleb Bradham, who made it at his drugstore where the drink was sold.  It was renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898 after the root of the word "dyspepsia" and the kola nuts used in the recipe. 

Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach<====>24576<====>Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach (14 November 1775 29 May 1833) was a German legal scholar.   His major work was a reform of the Bavarian penal code which became a model for several other countries. BiographyHe was born in Hainichen, near Jena.  He received his early education at Frankfurt on Main, where his family had moved soon after his birth.  At the age of sixteen, however, he ran away from home, and, going to Jena, was helped by relations there to study at the university.  In spite of poor health and the most desperate poverty, he made rapid progress. 

Pub<====>24578<====>Pub    A pub, or public house, is an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic drinks, which traditionally include beer (such as ale) and cider.   It is a relaxed, social drinking establishment and a prominent part of British, Public House Britannica. com.  Retrieved 3 September 2017.   Irish,  Breton, New Zealand, Canadian, South African and Australian cultures.   In many places, especially in villages, a pub is the focal point of the community.  In his 17th-century diary Samuel Pepys described the pub as "the heart of England".  Pubs can be traced back to Roman taverns,  through the Anglo-Saxon alehouse to the development of the tied house system in the 19th century. 

Pelvic inflammatory disease<====>24579<====>Pelvic inflammatory disease   Pelvic inflammatory disease or pelvic inflammatory disorder (PID) is an infection of the upper part of the female reproductive system namely the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis.   Often there may be no symptoms.Signs and symptoms, when present may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, or irregular menstruation.   Untreated PID can result in long term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.    The disease is caused by bacteria that spread from the vagina and cervix. 

Technology in Star Trek<====>24583<====>Technology in Star Trek DISPLAYTITLE The technology in Star Trek has borrowed freely from the scientific world to provide storylines.  Episodes are replete with references to tachyon beams, baryon sweeps, quantum fluctuations and event horizons.  Many of the technologies created for the Star Trek universe were done so out of simple financial necessity—the transporter was created because the limited budget of the original series in the 1960s did not allow expensive shots of spaceships landing on planets.  Discovery Channel Magazine stated that cloaking devices, faster-than-light travel and dematerialized transport were only dreams at the time the original series was made, but physicist Michio Kaku believes all these things are possible. 

Impulse drive<====>24586<====>Impulse drive In the fictional Star Trek universe, the impulse drive is the method of propulsion that starships and other spacecraft use when they are travelling below the speed of light.   Typically powered by deuterium fusion reactors, impulse engines let ships travel interplanetary distances readily.  For example, Starfleet Academy cadets use impulse engines when flying from Earth to Saturn and back.   Unlike the warp engines, impulse engines work on principles used in today's rocketry, throwing mass out the back as fast as possible to drive you forward. There are three practical challenges surrounding impulse drive design: acceleration, time dilation and energy conservation.

Punk subculture<====>24589<====>Punk subculture   Punk subculture includes a diverse array of ideologies, fashion, and other forms of expression, visual art, dance, literature and film.  It is largely characterised by anti-establishment views and the promotion of individual freedom, and is centred on a loud, aggressive genre of rock music called punk rock.  It's adherents are referred to as "punks". Punk politics cover the entire political spectrum.  Common punk ethos includes anti-authoritarianism, a do-it-yourself ethic, non-conformity, direct action and not "selling out". There is a wide range of punk fashion, including deliberately offensive T-shirts, leather jackets, Dr.  Martens boots, etc. 

Polyamory<====>24591<====>Polyamory    Polyamory (from Greek    , "many, several", and Latin  , "love") is the practice of, or desire for, intimate relationships with more than one partner, with the knowledge of all partners.   It has been described as "consensual, ethical, and responsible non-monogamy".  People who identify as polyamorous reject the view that sexual and relational exclusivity are necessary for deep, committed, long-term loving relationships.    Polyamorous arrangements are varied,reflecting the choices and philosophies of the individuals involved, but with recurring themes or values, such as love, intimacy, honesty, integrity, equality, communication, and commitment. 

Pope Theodore II<====>24592<====>Pope Theodore II   Pope Theodore II ( ; 840 – December 897) was Pope for twenty days in December 897.  His short reign occurred during a period of partisan strife in the Catholic Church, which was entangled with a period of feudal violence and disorder in central Italy.  His main act as pope was to annul the "Cadaver Synod" of the previous January, therefore reinstating the acts and ordinations of Pope Formosus, which had themselves been annulled by Pope Stephen VI.  He also had the body of Formosus recovered from the river Tiber and reburied with honour. 

Pope Formosus<====>24593<====>Pope Formosus  Pope Formosus (birth name unknown; c.  816 4 April 896) was Pope from 6 October 891 to his death in 896.  His brief reign as Pope was troubled, and his remains were exhumed and put on trial in the Cadaver Synod. As Cardinal-Bishop of Portus, he represented the Papacy on a number of diplomatic missions.  Shortly after the installation of Charles the Bald as Holy Roman Emperor, fearing certain political repercussions on the part of Pope John VIII, Formosus fled to Tours.  Upon refusing a directive to return, he was subsequently excommunicated.  The sentence was withdrawn in 878, upon his promising never to return to Rome. 

Proteolysis<====>24594<====>ProteolysisProteolysis is the breakdown of proteins into smaller polypeptides or amino acids.  Uncatalysed, the hydrolysis of peptide bonds is extremely slow, taking hundreds of years.  Proteolysis is typically catalysed by cellular enzymes called proteases, but may also occur by intra-molecular digestion.  Low pH or high temperatures can also cause proteolysis non-enzymatically. Proteolysis in organisms serves many purposes; for example, digestive enzymes break down proteins in food to provide amino acids for the organism, while proteolytic processing of a polypeptide chain after its synthesis may be necessary for the production of an active protein.  It is also important in the regulation of some physiological and cellular processes, as well as preventing the accumulation of unwanted or abnormal proteins in cells. 

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease<====>24595<====>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most prevalent, potentially lethal, monogenic human disorder.It is associated with large interfamilial and intrafamilial variability, which can be explained to a large extent by its genetic heterogeneity and modifier genes.   It is also the most common of the inherited cystic kidney diseases — a group of disorders with related but distinct pathogenesis, characterized by the development of renal cysts and various extrarenal manifestations, which in case of ADPKD include cysts in other organs, such as the liver, seminal vesicles, pancreas, and arachnoid membrane, as well as other abnormalities, such as intracranial aneurysms and dolichoectasias, aortic root dilatation and aneurysms, mitral valve prolapse, and abdominal wall hernias. 

Potsdamer Platz<====>24597<====>Potsdamer Platz  Potsdamer Platz ( , literally Potsdam Square) is an important public square and traffic intersection in the centre of Berlin, Germany, lying about   south of the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag (German Parliament Building), and close to the southeast corner of the Tiergarten park.  It is named after the city of Potsdam, some   to the south west, and marks the point where the old road from Potsdam passed through the city wall of Berlin at the Potsdam Gate.  After developing within the space of little over a century from an intersection of rural thoroughfares into the most bustling traffic intersection in Europe, Weitz, Eric D. 

Pointing device<====>24598<====>Pointing device A pointing device is an input interface (specifically a human interface device) that allows a user to input spatial (i. e. , continuous and multi-dimensional) data to a computer.  CAD systems and graphical user interfaces (GUI) allow the user to control and provide data to the computer using physical gestures by moving a hand-held mouse or similar device across the surface of the physical desktop and activating switches on the mouse.  Movements of the pointing device are echoed on the screen by movements of the pointer (or cursor) and other visual changes.   Common gestures are point and click and drag and drop. 

Pete Best<====>24600<====>Pete Best    Randolph Peter Best (born Scanland, 24 November 1941) is an English musician, principally known as an original member and the first drummer of the Beatles, from 1960 to 1962.  He is one of several people who have been referred to as the Fifth Beatle. Best was born in the city of Madras, then part of British India.  After Best's mother, Mona Best (1924–1988), moved to Liverpool in 1945, she opened the Casbah Coffee Club in the cellar of the Bests' house in Liverpool.  The Beatles (at the time known as the Quarrymen) played some of their first concerts at the club. 

Port Adelaide Football Club<====>24602<====>Port Adelaide Football Club   The Port Adelaide Football Club is a professional Australian rules football club based in Alberton, Port Adelaide, South Australia.  The club's senior team plays in the Australian Football League (AFL) under the nickname Power, whilst its reserves and development teams compete in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) under the nickname Magpies.   Port Adelaide is the oldest professional sporting club in South Australia and the fifth-oldest club in the AFL.  Since the club's first game on 24 May 1870, the club has won 36 South Australian league premierships, including six in a row. 

Proteasome<====>24603<====>Proteasome Proteasomes are protein complexes which degrade unneeded or damaged proteins by proteolysis, a chemical reaction that breaks peptide bonds.  Enzymes that help such reactions are called proteases. Proteasomes are part of a major mechanism by which cells regulate the concentration of particular proteins and degrade misfolded proteins.  Proteins are tagged for degradation with a small protein called ubiquitin.  The tagging reaction is catalyzed by enzymes called ubiquitin ligases.  Once a protein is tagged with a single ubiquitin molecule, this is a signal to other ligases to attach additional ubiquitin molecules.  The result is a polyubiquitin chain that is bound by the proteasome, allowing it to degrade the tagged protein.

Procedural law<====>24612<====>Procedural law Procedural law, adjective law, or rules of court comprises the rules by which a court hears and determines what happens in civil, lawsuit, criminal or administrative  s.   The rules are designed to ensure a fair and consistent application of due process (in the U. S. ) or fundamental justice (in other common law countries) to all cases that come before a court.  Substantive law, which refers to the actual claims and defenses whose validity is tested through the procedures of procedural law, is different from procedural law.  In context of procedural law, procedural rights  may also refer not exhaustively to rights to information, rights to justice, rights to participation which those rights encompassing, general civil and political rights. 

Pantoum<====>24613<====>PantoumThe pantoum is a poetic form derived from the pantun, a Malay verse form: specifically from the pantun berkait, a series of interwoven quatrains. StructureThe pantoum is a form of poetry similar to a villanelle in that there are repeating lines throughout the poem.  It is composed of a series of quatrains; the second and fourth lines of each stanza are repeated as the first.  The pattern continues for any number of stanzas, except for the final stanza, which differs in the repeating pattern.  The first and third lines of the last stanza are the second and fourth of the  ; the first line of the poem is the last line of the final stanza, and the third line of the first stanza is the second of the final. 

Pope Sylvester II<====>24614<====>Pope Sylvester II  Pope Sylvester II or Silvester II (  – 12 May 1003) was Pope from 2 April 999 to his death in 1003.  Originally known as Gerbert of Aurillac (  or  ;  ),  he was a prolific scholar and teacher.  He endorsed and promoted study of Arab and Greco-Roman arithmetic, mathematics, and astronomy, reintroducing to Europe the abacus and armillary sphere, which had been lost to Latin (though not Byzantine) Europe since the end of the Greco-Roman era. He is said to be the first to introduce in Europe the decimal numeral system using Arabic numerals. 

Pottery<====>24619<====>PotteryPottery is the ceramic material which makes up potterywares,  of which major types include earthenware, stoneware and porcelain.  The place where such wares are made by a potter is also called a pottery (plural "potteries").  The definition of pottery used by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) is "all fired ceramic wares that contain clay when formed, except technical, structural, and refractory products. " Pottery is one of the oldest human inventions, originating before the Neolithic period, with ceramic objects like the Gravettian culture Venus of Dolní Věstonice figurine discovered in the Czech Republic date back to 29,000–25,000 BC,  and pottery vessels that were discovered in Jiangxi, China, which date back to 18,000 BC. 

En plein air<====>24621<====>En plein air En plein air ( , French for outdoors, or plein air painting) is the act of painting outdoors.  This method contrasts with studio painting or academic rules that might create a predetermined look. HistoryArtists have long painted outdoors, but in the mid-19th century, working in natural light became particularly important to the Barbizon school, Hudson River School, and Impressionists.  The Newlyn School in England is considered another major proponent of the technique in the latter 19th century.   The popularity of painting en plein air increased in the 1840s with the introduction of paints in tubes (like those for toothpaste). 

Pacta sunt servanda<====>24622<====>Pacta sunt servandaPacta sunt servanda (Latin for "agreements must be kept" ), a brocard, is a basic principle of civil law, canon law, and international law. In its most common sense, the principle refers to private contracts, stressing that contained clauses are law between the parties, and implies that nonfulfillment of respective obligations is a breach of the pact. Civil lawIn civil law jurisdictions this principle is related to the general principle of correct behavior in commercial practice — including the assumption of good faith — is a requirement for the efficacy of the whole system, so the eventual disorder is sometimes punished by the law of some systems even without any direct penalty incurred by any of the parties. 

Paul Laurence Dunbar<====>24623<====>Paul Laurence Dunbar{{Infobox person }}Paul Laurence Dunbar (June 27, 1872 – February 9, 1906) was an American poet, novelist, and playwright of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Born in Dayton, Ohio, to parents who had been enslaved in Kentucky before the American Civil War, Dunbar began to write stories and verse when still a child; he was president of his high school's literary society.  He published his first poems at the age of 16 in a Dayton newspaper. Much of Dunbar's more popular work in his lifetime was written in the "Negro dialect" associated with the antebellum South, though he also used the Midwestern regional dialect of James Whitcomb Riley. 

Pop music<====>24624<====>Pop music   Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the United States and United Kingdom during the mid-1950s.   The terms "popular music" and "pop music" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many different styles.  "Pop" and "rock" were roughly synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they became increasingly differentiated from each other. Pop music is not necessarily popular.  It is defined by rhythms, instruments and tones. Although much of the music that appears on record charts is seen as pop music, the genre is distinguished from chart music. 

Paul Wertico<====>24625<====>Paul Wertico Paul Wertico (born January 5, 1953 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American drummer.  He gained recognition as a member of the Pat Metheny Group from 1983 until 2001,  leaving the group to spend more time with his family and to pursue other musical interests. Music careerGroupsAfter Pat Metheny heard the Simon and Bard Group with Wertico and bassist Steve Rodby, he invited both to join his band.  During his time with Metheny, Wertico played on ten albums and four videos, appeared on television, and toured around the world.  He won seven Grammy Awards (for "Best Jazz Fusion Performance," "Best Contemporary Jazz Performance," and "Best Rock Instrumental Performance"), magazine polls, and received several gold records. 

Porsche 356<====>24626<====>Porsche 356 The Porsche 356 is a luxury sports car which was first produced by Austrian company Porsche Konstruktionen GesmbH (1948–1949), and then by German company Dr.  Ing.  h.  c.  F.  Porsche GmbH (1950–1965).  It was Porsche's first production automobile.  Earlier cars designed by the Austrian company include Cisitalia Grand Prix race car, the Volkswagen Beetle, and Auto Union Grand Prix cars. The 356 is a lightweight and nimble-handling, rear-engine, rear-wheel drive, two-door available both in hardtop coupé and open configurations.  Engineering innovations continued during the years of manufacture, contributing to its motorsports success and popularity. 

Phospholipase<====>24628<====>PhospholipaseA phospholipase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes phospholipids  into fatty acids and other lipophilic substances.  There are four major classes, termed A, B, C and D, distinguished by the type of reaction which they catalyze:Phospholipase APhospholipase A1 – cleaves the SN-1 acyl chain. Phospholipase A2 – cleaves the SN-2 acyl chain, releasing arachidonic acid. Phospholipase B – cleaves both SN-1 and SN-2 acyl chains; this enzyme is also known as a lysophospholipase. Phospholipase C – cleaves before the phosphate, releasing diacylglycerol and a phosphate-containing head group.   Phospholipase Cs play a central role in signal transduction, releasing the second messenger inositol triphosphate. 

Pedro Martínez<====>24630<====>Pedro Martínez   Pedro Jaime Martínez (born October 25, 1971) is a Dominican–American  former starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for five teams from 1992 to 2009, most notably the Boston Red Sox from 1998 to 2004.  From 2002 to 2006 he held the major league record for the highest career winning percentage by a pitcher with at least 200 decisions; with a final record of 219 wins and 100 losses, he retired with the fourth-highest percentage in history, and the highest by a right-hander since the modern pitching era began in 1893.   He ended his career with an earned run average (ERA) of 2. 

Picts<====>24632<====>Picts  The Picts were a tribal confederation of peoples who lived in what is today eastern and northern Scotland during the Late Iron Age and Early Medieval periods.  They are thought to have been ethnolinguistically Celtic.  Where they lived and what their culture was like can be inferred from the geographical distribution of brochs, Brittonic place name elements, and Pictish stones.  Picts are attested to in written records from before the Roman conquest of Britain to the 10th century, when they are thought to have merged with the Gaels.  They lived to the north of the rivers Forth and Clyde, and spoke the now-extinct Pictish language, which is thought to have been closely related to the Celtic Brittonic language spoken by the Britons who lived to the south of them. 

Permutation group<====>24634<====>Permutation group In mathematics, a permutation group is a group G whose elements are permutations of a given set M and whose group operation is the composition of permutations in G (which are thought of as bijective functions from the set M to itself).  The group of all permutations of a set M is the symmetric group of M, often written as Sym(M).   The term permutation group thus means a subgroup of the symmetric group.  If   then, Sym(M), the symmetric group on n letters is usually denoted by S n . The way in which the elements of a permutation group permute the elements of the set is called its group action. 

Protein kinase<====>24635<====>Protein kinaseA protein kinase is a kinase enzyme that modifies other proteins by chemically adding phosphate groups to them (phosphorylation).  Phosphorylation usually results in a functional change of the target protein (substrate) by changing enzyme activity, cellular location, or association with other proteins.  The human genome contains about 560 protein kinase genes and they constitute about 2% of all human genes.Up to 30% of all human proteins may be modified by kinase activity, and kinases are known to regulate the majority of cellular pathways, especially those involved in signal transduction.  Protein kinases are also found in bacteria and plants, and include the pseudokinase sub-family, which exhibit unusual featuresincluding atypical nucleotide binding and weak, or no, catalytic activityand are part of a much larger pseudoenzyme group of 'degraded' enzyme relatives that are found throughout life, where they take an active participation in mechanistic cellular signaling. 

Pisa<====>24636<====>Pisa    Pisa ( ;  ) is a city in the Tuscany region of Central Italy straddling the Arno just before it empties into the Ligurian Sea.  It is the capital city of the Province of Pisa.  Although Pisa is known worldwide for its leaning tower (the bell tower of the city's cathedral), the city of over 91,104 residents (around 200,000 with the metropolitan area) contains more than 20 other historic churches, several medieval palaces and various bridges across the Arno.  Much of the city's architecture was financed from its history as one of the Italian maritime republics. 

Pentium FDIV bug<====>24637<====>Pentium FDIV bugThe Pentium FDIV bug was a computer bug that affected the floating point unit (FPU) of the early Intel Pentium processors.  Because of the bug, the processor might return incorrect binary floating point results when dividing a number.  Discovered in 1994 by Professor Thomas R.  Nicely at Lynchburg College,    Intel attributed the error to missing entries in the lookup table used by the floating-point division circuitry.  The severity of the FDIV bug is debated.   Intel, producer of the affected chip, claims that the common user would experience it once every 27,000 years while IBM, manufacturer of a chip competing with Intel's Pentium, claims that the common user would experience it once every 24 days. 

Percussion instrument<====>24638<====>Percussion instrument  A percussion instrument is a musical instrument that is sounded by being struck or scraped by a beater (including attached or enclosed beaters or rattles); struck, scraped or rubbed by hand; or struck against another similar instrument.  The percussion family is believed to include the oldest musical instruments, following the human voice.  The Oxford Companion to Music, 10th edition, p. 775,   The percussion section of an orchestra most commonly contains instruments such as timpani, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, triangle and tambourine.  However, the section can also contain non-percussive instruments, such as whistles and sirens, or a blown conch shell. 

Press Gang<====>24639<====>Press Gang    Press Gang is a British children's television comedy-drama consisting of 43 episodes across five series that were broadcast from 1989 to 1993.  It was produced by Richmond Film & Television for Central, and screened on the ITV network in its regular weekday afternoon children's strand, Children's ITV,    typically in a 4:45 pm slot (days varied over the course of the run). Aimed at older children and teenagers, the programme was based on the activities of a children's newspaper, the Junior Gazette, produced by pupils from the local comprehensive school.  In later series it was depicted as a commercial venture. 

Pope Innocent VII<====>24642<====>Pope Innocent VII    Pope Innocent VII ( ; 1339  – 6 November 1406), born Cosimo de' Migliorati, was Pope from 17 October 1404 to his death in 1406. He was pope during the period of the Western Schism (1378–1417) while there was the rival Antipope Benedict XIII at Avignon. Early lifeMigliorati was born to a simple family of Sulmona in the Abruzzi.  He distinguished himself by his learning in both civil and Canon Law, which he taught for a time at Perugia and Padua.  His teacher Giovanni da Legnano sponsored him at Rome, where Pope Urban VI (1378–89) took him into the Curia, sent him for ten years as papal collector to England,  made him Bishop of Bologna in 1386 at a time of strife in that city, and Archbishop of Ravenna in 1387. 

Pope Innocent VIII<====>24643<====>Pope Innocent VIII   Pope Innocent VIII ( ; 1432 – 25 July 1492), born Giovanni Battista Cybo (or Cibo), was Pope from 29 August 1484 to his death in 1492.  Born into a prominent Genoese family he entered the church and was made bishop in 1467 before being elevated to the rank of cardinal by Pope Sixtus IV.  He was elected Pope in 1484, as a compromise candidate, after a stormy conclave. Early yearsGiovanni Battista Cybo (or Cibo) was born in Genoa of Greek ancestry,    the son of Arano Cybo or Cibo (c. 

Pope Innocent IX<====>24644<====>Pope Innocent IX  Pope Innocent IX ( ; 20 July 1519 – 30 December 1591), born Giovanni Antonio Facchinetti,  was Pope from 29 October to 30 December 1591. Prior to his short papacy, he had been a canon lawyer, diplomat, and chief administrator during the reign of Pope Gregory XIV (1590–1591). BiographyEarly life and priesthoodGiovanni Antonio Facchinetti, whose family came from Crodo, in the diocese of Novara, northern Italy, was born in Bologna on 20 July 1519.  He was the son of Antonio Facchinetti and Francesca Cini. He studied at the University of Bologna - which was pre-eminent in jurisprudence - where he obtained a doctorate in both civil and canon law in 1544. 

Pope Innocent X<====>24645<====>Pope Innocent X  Pope Innocent X ( ; 6 May 1574 – 7 January 1655), born Giovanni Battista Pamphilj (or Pamphili), was Pope from 15 September 1644 to his death in 1655.    Born in Rome of a family from Gubbio in Umbria who had come to Rome during the pontificate of Pope Innocent IX, he graduated from the Collegio Romano and followed a conventional cursus honorum, following his uncle Girolamo Pamphilj as auditor of the Rota, and like him, attaining the dignity of Cardinal-Priest of Sant'Eusebio, in 1629. Trained as a lawyer, he succeeded Pope Urban VIII (1623–44) on 15 September 1644, as one of the most politically shrewd pontiffs of the era, who greatly increased the temporal power of the Holy See. 

Property law<====>24647<====>Property law  Property law is the area of law that governs the various forms of ownership and tenancy in real property (land as distinct from personal or movable possessions) and in personal property, within the common law legal system.  In the civil law system, there is a division between movable and immovable property.  Movable property roughly corresponds to personal property, while immovable property corresponds to real estate or real property, and the associated rights, and obligations thereon. The concept, idea or philosophy of property underlies all property law.  In some jurisdictions, historically all property was owned by the monarch and it devolved through feudal land tenure or other feudal systems of loyalty and fealty. 

Plea<====>24649<====>Plea    In legal terms, a plea is simply an answer to a claim made by someone in a criminal case under common law using the adversarial system.  Colloquially, a plea has come to mean the assertion by a defendant at arraignment, or otherwise in response to a criminal charge, whether that person pleaded guilty, not guilty, no contest or (in the United States) Alford plea. The concept of the plea is one of the major differences between criminal procedure under common law and procedure under the civil law system.  Under common law, a plea of guilty by the defendant waives trial of the charged offences and the defendant may be sentenced immediately. 

Pope Innocent XI<====>24650<====>Pope Innocent XI Pope Innocent XI ( ; 16 May 1611 – 12 August 1689), born Benedetto Odescalchi, ruled from 21 September 1676 to his death.  He is known in Budapest as the "Saviour of Hungary".  Much of his reign was concerned with tension with Louis XIV of France.  A conservative, he lowered taxes in the Papal States during his pontificate and he also produced a surplus in the papal budget.  Because of this surplus he repudiated excessive nepotism within the Church.  Innocent XI was frugal in matters of governing the Papal States, from dress to leading a life with Christian values. 

Pantograph<====>24651<====>Pantograph A pantograph (Greek roots παντ- "all, every" and γραφ- "to write", from their original use for copying writing) is a mechanical linkage connected in a manner based on parallelograms so that the movement of one pen, in tracing an image, produces identical movements in a second pen.  If a line drawing is traced by the first point, an identical, enlarged, or miniaturized copy will be drawn by a pen fixed to the other.  Using the same principle, different kinds of pantographs are used for other forms of duplication in areas such as sculpture, minting, engraving and milling. 

Princess Mononoke<====>24653<====>Princess Mononoke    is a 1997 Japanese animated epic historical fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, produced by Studio Ghibli and distributed by Toho.  The film stars the voices of Yōji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yūko Tanaka, Kaoru Kobayashi, Masahiko Nishimura, Tsunehiko Kamijo, Akihiro Miwa, Mitsuko Mori and Hisaya Morishige. Princess Mononoke is set in the late Muromachi period (approximately 1336 to 1573) of Japan with fantasy elements.  The story follows the young Emishi prince Ashitaka's involvement in a struggle between the gods of a forest and the humans who consume its resources.  The term   is not a name, but a Japanese word for a spirit or monster. 

Premier of New South Wales<====>24654<====>Premier of New South Wales  The Premier of New South Wales is the head of government in the state of New South Wales, Australia.  The Government of New South Wales follows the Westminster system, with a Parliament of New South Wales acting as the legislature.  The Premier is appointed by the Governor of New South Wales, and by modern convention holds office by virtue of his or her ability to command the support of a majority of members of the lower house of Parliament, the Legislative Assembly. Prior to Federation in 1901 the term "Prime Minister of New South Wales" was used, "Premier" was used from 1901. 

Premier of Victoria<====>24655<====>Premier of Victoria  The Premier of Victoria is the leader of the government in the Australian state of Victoria.  The Premier is appointed by the Governor of Victoria, and is the leader of the political party able to secure a majority in the Legislative Assembly.  Responsible government came to the colony of Victoria in 1855.  Between 1856 and 1892, the head of the government was commonly called the Premier or the Prime Minister, but neither title had any legal basis.  The head of government always held another portfolio, usually Chief Secretary or Treasurer, for which they were paid a salary. 

Standard Chinese<====>24657<====>Standard Chinese Standard Chinese, also known as Modern Standard Mandarin, Standard Mandarin, or simply Mandarin, is a standard variety of Chinese that is the sole official language of both China and Taiwan, and also one of the four official languages of Singapore.  Its pronunciation is based on the Beijing dialect, its vocabulary on the Mandarin dialects, and its grammar is based on written vernacular Chinese. Like other varieties of Chinese, Standard Chinese is a tonal language with topic-prominent organization and subject–verb–object word order.  It has more initial consonants but fewer vowels, final consonants and tones than southern varieties. 

Premier of Tasmania<====>24658<====>Premier of Tasmania  The Premier of Tasmania is the head of the executive government in the Australian state of Tasmania.  By convention, the leader of the party or political grouping which has majority support in the House of Assembly is invited by the Governor of Tasmania to be Premier and principal adviser.  Premier and Leader of the Opposition, Tasmanian Parliamentary Library.  Since the 2014 election, the Premier of Tasmania has been Will Hodgman, leader of the Liberal Party, which holds 15 of the 25 seats in the House of Assembly. List of Premiers of TasmaniaBefore the 1890s, there was no formal party system in Tasmania. 

Perihelion and aphelion<====>24659<====>Perihelion and aphelion   The perihelion ( ) of any orbit of a celestial body about the Sun is the point where the body comes nearest to the Sun.  It is the opposite of aphelion ( ), which is the point in the orbit where the celestial body is farthest from the Sun.  EtymologyThe words perihelion and aphelion were coined by Johannes Kepler  to describe the orbital motion of the planets. The words are formed from the prefixes peri- (Greek: περί, near)  and apo- (Greek: ἀπό, away from) affixed to the Greek word for the sun, ἥλιος. 

Privatization<====>24661<====>Privatization Privatization (also spelled privatisation) is the purchase of all outstanding shares of a publicly traded company by private investors.  The shares are then no longer traded at a stock exchange, as the company became private through private equity.  The second such type of privatization is the demutualization of a mutual organization or cooperative in order to form a joint-stock company.    Privatization may also refer to a government outsourcing services or functions to private firms, for example, revenue collection, law enforcement, and prison management.  The Economist magazine introduced the term "privatization" (or "privatisation") during the 1930s when it covered Nazi Germany's economic policy. 

Passage grave<====>24663<====>Passage grave near Sligo in Ireland]]A passage grave (sometimes hyphenated) or passage tomb consists of a narrow passage made of large stones and one or multiple burial chambers covered in earth or stone.  The building of passage tombs was normally carried out with megaliths and smaller stones; they usually date from the Neolithic Age.  Those with more than one chamber may have multiple sub-chambers leading off from the main burial chamber.  One common layout, the cruciform passage grave, is cross-shaped.  Sometimes passage tombs are covered with a cairn, especially those dating from later times.  Not all passage graves have been found to contain evidence of human remains. 

P-group<====>24664<====>P-group  DISPLAYTITLEIn mathematical group theory, given a prime number p, a p-group is a group in which each element has a power of p as its order.  That is, for each element g of a p-group, there exists a nonnegative integer n such that the product of p n  copies of g, and not less, is equal to the identity element.  The orders of different elements may be different powers of p. Abelian p-groups, are also called p-primary or simply primary. A finite group is a p-group if and only if its order (the number of its elements) is a power of p. 

Pope Innocent XII<====>24666<====>Pope Innocent XII  Pope Innocent XII ( ; 13 March 1615 – 27 September 1700), born Antonio Pignatelli, was Pope from 12 July 1691 to his death in 1700. He took a hard stance against nepotism in the church, continuing the policies of Pope Innocent XI, who started the battle against nepotism.  To that end, he issued a papal bull strictly forbidding it. BiographyEarly lifeAntonio Pignatelli was born on 13 March 1615 in Spinazzola (now in Apulia) to one of the most aristocratic families of the Kingdom of Naples, which had included several Viceroys and ministers of the crown. 

Protein phosphatase<====>24667<====>Protein phosphataseA protein phosphatase is a phosphatase enzyme that removes a phosphate group from the phosphorylated amino acid residue of its substrate protein.  Protein phosphorylation is one of the most common forms of reversible protein posttranslational modification (PTM), with up to 30% of all proteins being phosphorylated at any given time.  Protein kinases (PKs) are the effectors of phosphorylation and catalyse the transfer of a γ-phosphate from ATP to specific amino acids on proteins.  Several hundred PKs exist in mammals and are classified into distinct super-families.  Proteins are phosphorylated predominantly on Ser, Thr and Tyr residues, which account for 79. 

P5 (microarchitecture)<====>24668<====>P5 (microarchitecture) The first Pentium microprocessor was introduced by Intel on March 22, 1993.    Dubbed P5, its microarchitecture was the fifth generation for Intel, and the first superscalar IA-32 microarchitecture.  As a direct extension of the 80486 architecture, it included dual integer pipelines, a faster floating-point unit, wider data bus, separate code and data caches and features for further reduced address calculation latency.  In 1996, the Pentium with MMX Technology (often simply referred to as Pentium MMX) was introduced with the same basic microarchitecture complemented with an MMX instruction set, larger caches, and some other enhancements. 

Pauli exclusion principle<====>24669<====>Pauli exclusion principle  The Pauli exclusion principle is the quantum mechanical principle which states that  two or more identical fermions (particles with half-integer spin) cannot occupy the same quantum state within a quantum system simultaneously.  In the case of electrons in atoms, it can be stated as follows: it is impossible for two electrons of a poly-electron atom to have the same values of the four quantum numbers: n, the principal quantum number,  , the angular momentum quantum number, m   , the magnetic quantum number, and m s , the spin quantum number.  For example, if two electrons reside in the same orbital, and if their n,  , and m    values are the same, then their m s  must be different, and thus the electrons must have opposite half-integer spin projections of 1/2 and −1/2. 

Pasiphaë<====>24670<====>Pasiphaë  In Greek mythology, Pasiphaë ( ;    Pasipháē, "wide-shining" derived from pas "all, for all, of all" and phaos "light")  was a queen of Crete. FamilyPasiphae was the daughter of Helios, the Sun, by the eldest  of the Oceanids, Perse.   Like her doublet Europa, her origins were in the East, in her case at Colchis, she was the sister of Circe, and she was given in marriage to King Minos of Crete.  With Minos, she was the mother of Acacallis, Ariadne, Androgeus, Glaucus, Deucalion, Phaedra, Xenodice, and Catreus.  She was also the mother of "starlike" Asterion, called by the Greeks the Minotaur. 

Primate (bishop)<====>24672<====>Primate (bishop)   Primate ( ) is a title or rank bestowed on some archbishops in certain Christian churches.  Depending on the particular tradition, it can denote either jurisdictional authority  (title of authority) or (usually) ceremonial precedence (title of honour).  Roman Catholic Church In the Western Church, a Primate is an Archbishop—or rarely a suffragan or exempt bishop—of a specific (mostly Metropolitan) episcopal see (called a primatial see) who has precedence over the bishoprics of one or more ecclesiastical provinces of a particular historical, political or cultural area.  Historically, Primates of particular sees were granted privileges including the authority to call and preside at national synods, jurisdiction to hear appeals from metropolitan tribunals, the right to crown the sovereign of the nation, and presiding at the investiture (installation) of archbishops in their sees.

Pigeonhole sort<====>24681<====>Pigeonhole sort  Pigeonhole sorting is a sorting algorithm that is suitable for sorting lists of elements where the number of elements (n) and the length of the range of possible key values (N) are approximately the same.   It requires O(n + N) time.   It is similar to counting sort, but differs in that it "moves items twice: once to the bucket array and again to the final destination [whereas] counting sort builds an auxiliary array then uses the array to compute each item's final destination and move the item there. " The pigeonhole algorithm works as follows:Given an array of values to be sorted, set up an auxiliary array of initially empty "pigeonholes," one pigeonhole for each key through the range of the original array. 

Pope Innocent XIII<====>24683<====>Pope Innocent XIII   Pope Innocent XIII ( ; 13 May 1655 – 7 March 1724), born as Michelangelo dei Conti, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 8 May 1721 to his death in 1724.  He is the last pope to date to take the pontifical name of "Innocent" upon his election. Pope Innocent XIII was reform-oriented, and he imposed new standards of frugality, abolishing excessive spending.  He took steps to finally end the practice of nepotism by issuing a decree which forbade his successors from granting land, offices or income to any relatives - something opposed by many cardinals who hoped that they might become pope and benefit their families. 

Pope Julius I<====>24684<====>Pope Julius I   Pope Julius I (died 12 April 352) was the 35th Pope of the Catholic Church from 6 February 337 to his death in 352.  He was notable for asserting the authority of the pope over the Arian Eastern bishops, and also for setting the date of 25 December for celebrating the Nativity. BiographyJulius I was a native of Rome and was chosen as successor of Pope Mark after the Roman see had been vacant for four months.  He is chiefly known by the part he took in the Arian controversy.  After the followers of Eusebius of Nicomedia, who had become the archbishop of Constantinople, renewed their deposition of Athanasius at a synod held in Antioch in 341, they resolved to send delegates to Constans, Emperor of the West, and also to Julius, setting forth the grounds on which they had proceeded. 

Pope Julius III<====>24685<====>Pope Julius III  Pope Julius III ( ; 10 September 1487 – 23 March 1555), born Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 7 February 1550 to his death in 1555. After a career as a distinguished and effective diplomat, he was elected to the papacy as a compromise candidate after the death of Paul III.  As pope he made only reluctant and short-lived attempts at reform, mostly devoting himself to a life of personal pleasure.  His reputation, and that of the Catholic Church, were greatly harmed by his scandal-ridden relationship with his adopted nephew. 

Pope Eugene I<====>24686<====>Pope Eugene I  Pope Eugene I (d.  2 June 657), also known as Eugenius I, was Pope from 10 August 654 to his death in 657.  He was a native of Rome, born to one Rufinianus. In June 653, in the midst of a dispute with Byzantine Emperor Constans II over Monothelitism (the belief that Jesus had that only a single, divine will), Pope Martin I was seized and carried to Constantinople and subsequently exiled to Cherson in the Crimea.  Initially, in the pontiff's absence, the church was probably governed by the archpriest, archdeacon and the primicerius of the notaries. 

Pope Eugene II<====>24687<====>Pope Eugene II  Pope Eugene II ( ; died 27 August 827) was Pope from June 6, 824 to his death in 827.  A native of Rome, he was chosen to succeed Paschal I.  Another candidate, Zinzinnus, was proposed by the plebeian faction, and the presence of Lothair I, son of the Frankish emperor Louis the Pious, was necessary in order to maintain the authority of the new pope.  Lothair took advantage of this opportunity to redress many abuses in the papal administration, to vest the election of the pope in the nobles, and to confirm the statute that no pope should be consecrated until his election had the approval of the Frankish emperor. 

Pope Eugene III<====>24688<====>Pope Eugene III    Pope Eugene III ( ; c.  1080 – 8 July 1153), born Bernardo da Pisa, was Pope from 15 February 1145 to his death in 1153.  He was the first Cistercian to become Pope.  In response to the fall of Edessa to the Muslims in 1144, Eugene proclaimed the Second Crusade.  The crusade failed to recapture Edessa, which was the first of many failures by the Christians in the crusades to recapture lands won in the First Crusade. He was beatified on 28 December 1872 by Pope Pius IX on the account of his sanctity. 

Plaintiff<====>24690<====>Plaintiff  A plaintiff (Π in legal shorthand) is the party who initiates a lawsuit (also known as an action) before a court.  By doing so, the plaintiff seeks a legal remedy, and if successful, the court will issue judgment in favor of the plaintiff and make the appropriate court order (e. g. , an order for damages).  "Plaintiff" is the term used in civil cases in most English-speaking jurisdictions, the notable exception being England and Wales, where a plaintiff has, since the introduction of the Civil Procedure Rules in 1999, been known as a "claimant", but that term also has other meanings. 

Philosophy of law<====>24694<====>Philosophy of law Philosophy of law is a branch of philosophy and jurisprudence that seeks to answer basic questions about law and legal systems, such as "What is law?", "What are the criteria for legal validity?", "What is the relationship between law and morality?", and many other similar questions. Analytic jurisprudence"The principal objective of analytical jurisprudence has traditionally been to provide an account of what distinguishes law as a system of norms from other systems of norms, such as ethical norms. "  The question that has received the most attention from philosophers of law is What is law?  Several schools of thought have provided rival answers to this question, the most influential of which are:Natural law theory asserts that there are laws that are immanent in nature, to which enacted laws should correspond as closely as possible. 

Personal property<====>24695<====>Personal property   Personal property is generally considered property that is movable,  as opposed to real property or real estate.  In common law systems, personal property may also be called chattels or personalty.  In civil law systems, personal property is often called movable property or movables – any property that can be moved from one location to another. Personal property is movable and can be understood in comparison to immovable property or real property, such as land and buildings.  Movable property on land, for example, larger livestock, was not automatically sold with the land, it was "personal" to the owner and moved with the owner. 

Prima facie<====>24696<====>Prima facie   Prima facie ( ,  , or  ; from  ) is a Latin expression meaning on its first encounter or at first sight.  The literal translation would be "at first face" or "at first appearance", from the feminine forms of primus ("first") and facies ("face"), both in the ablative case.  In modern, colloquial and conversational English, a common translation would be, "on the face of it".  The term prima facie is used in modern legal English (including both civil law and criminal law) to signify that upon initial examination, sufficient corroborating evidence appears to exist to support a case. 

Product liability<====>24697<====>Product liability Product liability is the area of law in which manufacturers, distributors, suppliers, retailers, and others who make products available to the public are held responsible for the injuries those products cause.    Although the word "product" has broad connotations, product liability as an area of law is traditionally limited to products in the form of tangible personal property.  Product liability in the United StatesTheories of liabilityIn the United States, the claims most commonly associated with product liability are negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty, and various consumer protection claims.  The majority of product liability laws are determined at the state level and vary widely from state to state. 

Proximate cause<====>24698<====>Proximate cause  In the law, a proximate cause is an event sufficiently related to an injury that the courts deem the event to be the cause of that injury.   There are two types of causation in the law: cause-in-fact, and proximate (or legal) cause.   Cause-in-fact is determined by the "but for" test: But for the action, the result would not have happened.   For example, but for running the red light, the collision would not have occurred.  The action is a necessary condition, but may not be a sufficient condition, for the resulting injury. 

Peace<====>24702<====>Peace Peace is a certain quality of existence which has been sought after, yet seldom found in a long enduring form, since time immemorial.  In a behavioral sense, peace is generally understood to be a lack of conflict and freedom from fear of violence between heterogenous social groups.   Throughout history benevolent leaders have often exhibited a certain type of behavioral or political restraint, which in turn has often resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties.   Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the de-escalation of conflicts, or in multilateral or bilateral peace talks. 

Portland Vase<====>24703<====>Portland Vase The Portland Vase is a Roman cameo glass vase, which is dated to between AD 1 and AD 25, though low BC dates have some scholarly support.   It is the best known piece of Roman cameo glass and has served as an inspiration to many glass and porcelain makers from about the beginning of the 18th century onwards.  It is first recorded in Rome in 1600–1601, and since 1810 has been in the British Museum in London.  It was bought by the museum in 1945 (GR 1945,0927. 1) and is normally on display in Room 70. 

Pyrenees<====>24707<====>Pyrenees The Pyrenees ( ;    ,    ,  ,    ,  ,    ) is a range of mountains in southwest Europe that forms a natural border between Spain and France.  Reaching a height of   altitude at the peak of Aneto, the range separates the Iberian Peninsula from the rest of continental Europe, and extends for about   from the Bay of Biscay (Cap Higuer) to the Mediterranean Sea (Cap de Creus). For the most part, the main crest forms a divide between Spain and France, with the microstate of Andorra sandwiched in between. 

Planetary nomenclature<====>24709<====>Planetary nomenclaturePlanetary nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is a system of uniquely identifying features on the surface of a planet or natural satellite so that the features can be easily located, described, and discussed.  Since the invention of the telescope, astronomers have given names to the surface features they have discerned, especially on the Moon and Mars.  To standardize planetary nomenclature, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) was assigned in 1919 the task of selecting official names for features on solar system bodies.  How names are approved by the IAUWhen images are first obtained of the surface of a planet or satellite, a theme for naming features is chosen and a few important features are named, usually by members of the appropriate IAU task group (a commonly accepted planet-naming group). 

North American P-51 Mustang<====>24710<====>North American P-51 Mustang    {|  |}The North American Aviation P-51 Mustang is an American long-range, single-seat fighter and fighter-bomber used during World War II and the Korean War, among other conflicts.  The Mustang was designed in 1940 by North American Aviation (NAA) in response to a requirement of the British Purchasing Commission.  The Purchasing Commission approached North American Aviation to build Curtiss P-40 fighters under license for the Royal Air Force (RAF).  Rather than build an old design from another company, North American Aviation proposed the design and production of a more modern fighter. 

Precession<====>24714<====>Precession Precession is a change in the orientation of the rotational axis of a rotating body.  In an appropriate reference frame it can be defined as a change in the first Euler angle, whereas the third Euler angle defines the rotation itself.  In other words, if the axis of rotation of a body is itself rotating about a second axis, that body is said to be precessing about the second axis.  A motion in which the second Euler angle changes is called nutation.  In physics, there are two types of precession: torque-free and torque-induced. In astronomy, precession refers to any of several slow changes in an astronomical body's rotational or orbital parameters. 

Punjab<====>24717<====>PunjabThe Punjab ( ,  ,  ,  ), also spelled Panjab (land of "five rivers";  Punjabi:(Shahmukhi); (Gurumukhi) ), is a geographical and cultural region in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, comprising areas of eastern Pakistan and northern India.  Not being a political unit, the boundaries of the region are ill-defined and focus on historical accounts. Until the Partition of Punjab in 1947, the British Punjab Province encompassed the present-day Indian states of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, and Delhi, and the Pakistani provinces of Punjab and Islamabad Capital Territory. 

Ring system<====>24718<====>Ring system A ring system is a disc or ring orbiting an astronomical object that is composed of solid material such as dust and moonlets, and is a common component of satellite systems around giant planets.  A ring system around a planet is also known as a planetary ring system. The most prominent and most famous planetary rings in the Solar System are those around Saturn, but the other three giant planets (Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune) also have ring systems.  Recent evidence suggests that ring systems may also be found around other types of astronomical objects, including minor planets, moons, and brown dwarfs.

P-code machine<====>24722<====>P-code machine In computer programming, a p-code machine, or portable code machine  is a virtual machine designed to execute p-code (the assembly language of a hypothetical CPU).  This term is applied both generically to all such machines (such as the Java Virtual Machine and MATLAB precompiled code), and to specific implementations, the most famous being the p-Machine of the Pascal-P system, particularly the UCSD Pascal implementation (among whose developers the "p" in "p-code" was construed to mean "pseudo" more often than "portable", "pseudo-code" thus meaning instructions for a pseudo-machine) . Although the concept was first implemented circa 1966 (as O-code for BCPL and P  a code for the Euler Language),  the term p-code first appeared in the early 1970s. 

Proton-pump inhibitor<====>24723<====>Proton-pump inhibitor Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a group of drugs whose main action is a pronounced and long-lasting reduction of stomach acid production.  Within the class of medications, there is no clear evidence that one agent works better than another.They are the most potent inhibitors of acid secretion available.This group of drugs followed and largely superseded another group of medications with similar effects, but a different mode of action, called H 2 -receptor antagonists.  PPIs are among the most widely sold drugs in the world, and the first one, omeprazole, is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. 

Pan-Slavism<====>24724<====>Pan-Slavism Pan-Slavism, a movement which crystallized in the mid-19th century, is the political ideology concerned with the advancement of integrity and unity for the Slavic-speaking peoples.  Its main impact occurred in the Balkans, where non-Slavic empires—the Byzantine Empire, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Venice—had ruled the South Slavs for centuries. OriginsExtensive pan-Slavism began much like Pan-Germanism, both of which grew from the sense of unity and nationalism experienced within ethnic groups after the French Revolution and the consequent Napoleonic Wars against European monarchies.  Like other Romantic nationalist movements, Slavic intellectuals and scholars in the developing fields of history, philology, and folklore actively encouraged the passion of their shared identity and ancestry. 

Pan-Germanism<====>24727<====>Pan-Germanism  Pan-Germanism (  or  ), also occasionally known as Pan-Germanicism, is a pan-nationalist political idea.  Pan-Germanists originally sought to unify all the German and possibly also Germanic-speaking peoples in a single nation-state known as Großdeutschland. Pan-Germanism was highly influential in German politics in the 19th century during the unification of Germany when the German Empire was proclaimed as a nation-state in 1871 but without Austria (Kleindeutsche Lösung/Lesser Germany),    and the first half of the 20th century in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the German Empire.  From the late 19th century, many Pan-Germanist thinkers, since 1891 organized in the Pan-German League, had adopted openly ethnocentric and racist ideologies, and ultimately gave rise to the foreign policy Heim ins Reich pursued by Nazi Germany under Austrian-born Adolf Hitler from 1938, one of the primary factors leading to the outbreak of World War II. 

Patrick Abercromby<====>24730<====>Patrick Abercromby    Patrick Abercromby (1656  ) was a Scottish physician and antiquarian, noted for being physician to King James VII (II of England) and his fervent opposition to the Act of Union between Scotland and England. Early lifePatrick Abercromby was the third son of Alexander Abercromby of Fetterneir in Aberdeenshire, and brother of Francis Abercromby, who was created Lord Glasford by King James II.  He was born at Forfar in 1656 apparently of a Roman Catholic family.  Intending to become a doctor of medicine he entered the University of St Andrews, where he took his degree of M. 

Positron<====>24731<====>Positron  The positron or antielectron is the antiparticle or the antimatter counterpart of the electron.  The positron has an electric charge of +1 e, a spin of 1/2 (same as electron), and has the same mass as an electron.  When a positron collides with an electron, annihilation occurs.  If this collision occurs at low energies, it results in the production of two or more gamma ray photons (see electron–positron annihilation). Positrons may be generated by positron emission radioactive decay (through weak interactions), or by pair production from a sufficiently energetic photon which is interacting with an atom in a material. 

Phencyclidine<====>24733<====>Phencyclidine  Phencyclidine (PCP), also known as angel dust among other names,  is a dissociative drug.  PCP was brought to market in the 1950s as an anesthetic pharmaceutical drug but was taken off the market in 1965 due to the high prevalence of dissociative hallucinogenic side effects.  Moreover, the discovery of ketamine by Parke-Davis researchers was thought to represent a better-tolerated alternative for use as an anesthetic medication.  Since then a number of synthetic derivatives of PCP have been sold as dissociative drugs for recreational and non-medical use.    In chemical structure, PCP is a member of the arylcyclohexylamine class, and, in pharmacology, it is a member of the family of dissociative anesthetics. 

Product of group subsets<====>24734<====>Product of group subsetsIn mathematics, one can define a product of group subsets in a natural way.  If S and T are subsets of a group G, then their product is the subset of G defined by ST = \{st : s \in S \text{ and } t\in T\}.  The subsets S and T need not be subgroups for this product to be well defined.  The associativity of this product follows from that of the group product.  The product of group subsets therefore defines a natural monoid structure on the power set of G. A lot more can be said in the case where S and T are subgroups. 

PCHP<====>24736<====>PCHP 1-(1-Phenylcyclohexyl)-4-hydroxypiperidine (PCHP) is a metabolite of phencyclidine (PCP).   PCHP can be detected in the hair, urine, stool, sweat, and saliva of PCP users. See also4-Phenyl-4-(1-piperidinyl)cyclohexanol, another PCP metaboliteReferences

Piperidine<====>24739<====>Piperidine Piperidine is an organic compound with the molecular formula (CH 2 ) 5 NH.  This heterocyclic amine consists of a six-membered ring containing five methylene bridges (–CH 2 –) and one amine bridge (–NH–).  It is a colorless liquid with an odor described as objectionable, and typical of amines.    the name comes from the genus name Piper, which is the Latin word for pepper.   Although piperidine is a common organic compound, it is best known as a representative structure element within many pharmaceuticals and alkaloids. ProductionPiperidine was first reported in 1850 by the Scottish chemist Thomas Anderson and again, independently, in 1852 by the French chemist Auguste Cahours, who named it. 

Political question<====>24740<====>Political question In American Constitutional law, the political question doctrine is closely linked to the concept of justiciability, as it comes down to a question of whether or not the court system is an appropriate forum in which to hear the case.   This is because the court system only has authority to hear and decide a legal question, not a political question.   Legal questions are deemed to be justiciable, while political questions are nonjusticiable.  Huhn, Wilson R.   American Constitutional Law Volume 1.  2016.   One scholar explained: A ruling of nonjusticiability will ultimately prohibit the issue that is bringing the case before the court from being able to be heard in a court of law. 

Paul Dirac<====>24742<====>Paul Dirac  Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac ( ; 8 August 1902 – 20 October 1984) was an English theoretical physicist who made fundamental contributions to the early development of both quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics.  He was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, a member of the Center for Theoretical Studies, University of Miami, and spent the last decade of his life at Florida State University. Among other discoveries, he formulated the Dirac equation which describes the behaviour of fermions and predicted the existence of antimatter. 

Pessimism<====>24743<====>PessimismPessimism is a mental attitude displayed by negative individuals.  Pessimists anticipate undesirable outcomes from a given situation, which is generally referred to as situational pessimism, or believe that undesirable things are going to happen to them in life more than desirable ones.  Pessimists also tend to focus on the negatives of life in general or a given situation.  The most common example of this phenomenon is the "Is the glass half empty or half full?" situation.  In this situation a pessimist is said to see the glass as half empty while an optimist is said to see the glass as half full. 

Peter Wessel Zapffe<====>24744<====>Peter Wessel Zapffe   Peter Wessel Zapffe (December 18, 1899 – October 12, 1990) was a Norwegian metaphysician, author, lawyer and mountaineer.  He is often noted for his philosophically pessimistic and fatalistic view of human existence Tangenes, Gisle,   —his system of philosophy in line with the work of the earlier philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, by whom he was inspired—as well as his firm advocacy of antinatalism.   His thoughts regarding the error of human life are presented in the essay "The Last Messiah" (Norwegian: Den sidste Messias, 1933).  This essay is a shorter version of his best-known work, the philosophical treatise On the Tragic (Om det tragiske, 1941). 

Franc Poincaré<====>24745<====>Franc Poincaré The Franc Poincaré is a unit of account that was used in the international regulation of liability.  It is defined as 65. 5 milligrams of gold of millesimal fineness . 900.  Formerly it was identical to the French franc, although it has not been so since the 1920s. Practice on its conversion to national currencies varies from state to state; in most states the conversion factor is based not on the market price of gold, but on an official price (a remnant of the gold standard, frequently far below its market price today).  The Franc Poincaré has been replaced for most purposes by special drawing rights. 

PCX<====>24746<====>PCX  PCX, standing for PiCture eXchange, is an image file format developed by the now-defunct ZSoft Corporation of Marietta, Georgia, United States.  It was the native file format for PC Paintbrush and became one of the first widely accepted DOS imaging standards, although it has since been succeeded by more sophisticated image formats, such as BMP, JPEG, and PNG.  PCX files commonly stored palette-indexed images ranging from 2 or 4 colors to 16 and 256 colors, although the format has been extended to record true-color (24-bit) images as well.

Permian–Triassic extinction event<====>24749<====>Permian–Triassic extinction event The Permian–Triassic (P–Tr or P–T) extinction event, colloquially known as the Great Dying,    the End-Permian Extinction or the Great Permian Extinction,   occurred about 252 Ma (million years) ago,    forming the boundary between the Permian and Triassic geologic periods, as well as the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras.  It is the Earth's most severe known extinction event, with up to 96% of all marine species  and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species becoming extinct.It is the only known mass extinction of insects. 

Porter Blanchard<====>24750<====>Porter Blanchard Porter George Blanchard (1886–1973) was an American silversmith living and working in Pacoima, California.  He is considered to be part of the Arts and Crafts Movement. CareerBlanchard learned the trade of the silversmith from his father, George Porter Blanchard in Gardner, Massachusetts.  In 1923, Blanchard moved to Burbank, California, where he established a studio for silversmithing.Between the 1930s and 1950, he operated a shop in Hollywood.  He then worked from his home in Pacoima from the 1940s until his death in 1973.    His daughter Alice Blanchard married Lewis Wise, who conducted business as Porter Blanchard Silversmiths in Calabasas, California. 

Punjab, Pakistan<====>24751<====>Punjab, Pakistan    Punjab (Urdu, Punjabi:   , panj-āb, "five waters":  ) is Pakistan's second largest province by area, after Balochistan, and its most populous province, with an estimated population of 110,012,442 as of 2017.   It is bordered by the Pakistan provinces of Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the enclave of Islamabad, and Azad Kashmir.  It also shares borders with the Indian states of Punjab, Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir.  The provincial capital of Punjab is the city Lahore, a cultural, historical, economic and cosmopolitan centre of Pakistan where the country's cinema industry, and much of its fashion industry, are based. 

Politburo<====>24752<====>PolitburoA politburo   or political bureau is the executive committee for Communist Parties.  NamesThe term "politburo" in English comes from the Russian Politbyuro ( ), itself a contraction of Politicheskoye Byuro ( , "Political Bureau").  The Spanish term Politburó is directly loaned from Russian, as is the German Politbüro.  Chinese uses a calque ( ), from which the Vietnamese ( ), and Korean (  Jeongchiguk) terms derive. HistoryThe first politburo was created in Russia by the Bolshevik Party in 1917 to provide strong and continuous leadership during the Russian Revolution occurring during the same year. 

Pope Julius II<====>24755<====>Pope Julius II   Pope Julius II ( ;  ) (5 December 1443 – 21 February 1513),  born Giuliano della Rovere, and nicknamed "The Fearsome Pope"  and "The Warrior Pope",  was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 1 November 1503 to his death in 1513.   His papacy was marked by an active foreign policy, ambitious building projects, and patronage of the arts—he commissioned the destruction and rebuilding of St.  Peter's Basilica, and Michelangelo's decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.  In addition to an active military policy, he personally led troops into battle on at least two occasions, the first to expel Giovanni Bentivoglio from Bologna (17 August 1506 – 23 March 1507), and the second in an attempt to recover Ferrara for the Papal States (1 September 1510 – 29 June 1512). 

Proteus<====>24759<====>ProteusIn Greek mythology, Proteus ( ;  Ancient Greek: Πρωτεύς) is an early sea-god or god of rivers and oceanic bodies of water, one of several deities whom Homer calls the "Old Man of the Sea".   Some who ascribe to him a specific domain call him the god of "elusive sea change", which suggests the constantly changing nature of the sea or the liquid quality of water in general.  He can foretell the future, but, in a mytheme familiar to several cultures, will change his shape to avoid having to; he will answer only to someone who is capable of capturing the beast. 

Pope Eusebius<====>24760<====>Pope Eusebius    Pope Eusebius (from Greek Εὐσέβιος  "pious"; died 17 August 309 or 310) was the Bishop of Rome from 18 April to his death in 309 or 310. HistoryHis pontificate lasted four months, after which, in consequence of disturbances within the Church which led to acts of violence, he was banished by the emperor Maxentius, who had been the ruler of Rome since 306, and had at first shown himself friendly to the Christians.  The difficulty arose, as in the case of his predecessor Pope Marcellus I, out of his attitude toward the lapsi.

TP53<====>24762<====>TP53  Tumor protein p53, also known as p53, cellular tumor antigen p53 (UniProt name), phosphoprotein p53,  tumor suppressor p53, antigen NY-CO-13, or transformation-related protein 53 (TRP53), is any isoform of a protein encoded by homologous genes in various organisms, such as TP53 (humans) and Trp53 (mice).  This homolog (originally thought to be, and often spoken of as, a single protein) is crucial in multicellular organisms, where it prevents cancer formation, thus, functions as a tumor suppressor.As such, p53 has been described as "the guardian of the genome" because of its role in conserving stability by preventing genome mutation. 

Pointless topology<====>24764<====>Pointless topologyIn mathematics, pointless topology (also called point-free or pointfree topology, or locale theory) is an approach to topology that avoids mentioning points.  The name 'pointless topology' is due to John von Neumann.    The ideas of pointless topology are closely related to mereotopologies in which regions (sets) are treated as foundational without explicit reference to underlying point sets. General conceptsTraditionally, a topological space consists of a set of points together with a topology, a system of subsets called open sets that with the operations of intersection and union forms a lattice with certain properties.  Pointless topology then studies lattices like these abstractly, without reference to any underlying set of points. 

Pizza<====>24768<====>PizzaPizza is a traditional Italian dish consisting of a yeasted flatbread typically topped with tomato sauce and cheese and baked in an oven.  It can also be topped with additional vegetables, meats, and condiments.  The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century, in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italy town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania.   Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular and common in many areas of the world.In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish. 

Phase modulation<====>24772<====>Phase modulation   Phase modulation (PM) is a modulation pattern for conditioning communication signals for transmission.  It encodes a message signal as variations in the instantaneous phase of a carrier wave.  Phase modulation is one of the two principle forms of angle modulation, together with frequency modulation. The phase of a carrier signal is modulated to follow the changing signal level (amplitude) of the message signal.  The peak amplitude and the frequency of the carrier signal are maintained constant, but as the amplitude of the message signal changes, the phase of the carrier changes correspondingly. Phase modulation is widely used for transmitting radio waves and is an integral part of many digital transmission coding schemes that underlie a wide range of technologies like Wi-Fi, GSM and satellite television. 

Phosphodiesterase inhibitor<====>24774<====>Phosphodiesterase inhibitor A phosphodiesterase inhibitor is a drug that blocks one or more of the five subtypes of the enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE), thereby preventing the inactivation of the intracellular second messengers cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by the respective PDE subtype(s). HistoryThe different forms or subtypes of phosphodiesterase were initially isolated from rat brains by Uzunov and Weiss in 1972  and were soon afterward shown to be selectively inhibited in the brain and in other tissues by a variety of drugs.    The potential for selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors as therapeutic agents was predicted as early as 1977 by Weiss and Hait. 

Piston<====>24776<====>Piston  A piston is a component of reciprocating engines, reciprocating pumps, gas compressors and pneumatic cylinders, among other similar mechanisms.  It is the moving component that is contained by a cylinder and is made gas-tight by piston rings.  In an engine, its purpose is to transfer force from expanding gas in the cylinder to the crankshaft via a piston rod and/or connecting rod.  In a pump, the function is reversed and force is transferred from the crankshaft to the piston for the purpose of compressing or ejecting the fluid in the cylinder.  In some engines, the piston also acts as a valve by covering and uncovering ports in the cylinder Piston engines Internal combustion enginesAn internal combustion engine is acted upon by the pressure of the expanding combustion gases in the combustion chamber space at the top of the cylinder.

Five Precepts<====>24780<====>Five Precepts  The Five Precepts (Pali: pañcasīlāni; Sanskrit pañcaśīlāni ) constitute the basic code of ethics undertaken by upāsaka and upāsikā ("lay followers") of Buddhism.  The precept s in all the traditions are essentially identical and are commitments to abstain from harming living beings, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying and intoxication.  A precept is a  general rule intended to regulate behaviour or thought. Undertaking the five precepts is part of both lay Buddhist initiation and regular lay Buddhist devotional practices.  They are not formulated as imperatives, but as training rules that lay people undertake voluntarily to facilitate practice. 

Pente<====>24782<====>Pente Pente is a strategy board game for two or more players, created in 1977 by Gary Gabrel, a dishwasher at Hideaway Pizza, in Stillwater, Oklahoma.   Customers played Pente at Hideaway Pizza on checkerboard tablecloths while waiting for their orders to arrive.  Thirty years later, patrons are still playing Pente at Hideaway Pizza, although now with roll-up Pente boards.   Pente is based on the Japanese game ninuki-renju, a variant of renju or gomoku that is played on a Go board of 19x19 intersections with white and black stones.   Like ninuki-renju, Pente allows captures, but Pente added a new opening rule. 

Pompatus<====>24783<====>PompatusPompatus  ,   is a nonsense word coined by Steve Miller and most famously used in his 1973 hit single "The Joker".  The word was inspired by a similar nonsense word, sometimes transliterated as "puppetutes," in the 1954 song "The Letter" by The Medallions.  The oddness and unknown meaning of the word occasioned some attention and further use, including being used in the title of a movie.  Adams, Cecil.  'In Steve Miller's "The Joker," what is "the pompatus of love"?', The Straight Dope, 1996.  LyricsThe lyrics of "The Joker" include the quatrain:Some people call me the space cowboy. 

UGM-27 Polaris<====>24787<====>UGM-27 Polaris   The UGM-27 Polaris missile was a two-stage solid-fueled nuclear-armed submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) built during the Cold War by Lockheed Corporation for the United States Navy.    It was designed to be used for second strike countervalue (CEP not good enough for first strike counterforce) as part of the Navy's contribution to the United States arsenal of nuclear weapons, replacing the Regulus cruise missile.  Known as a Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM), the Polaris was first launched from the Cape Canaveral, Florida, missile test base on January 7, 1960.  Following the Polaris Sales Agreement in 1963, Polaris missiles were also carried on British Royal Navy submarines between 1968 and the mid-1990s. 

UGM-73 Poseidon<====>24788<====>UGM-73 Poseidon The UGM-73 Poseidon missile was the second US Navy nuclear-armed submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) system, powered by a two-stage solid-fuel rocket.  It succeeded the UGM-27 Polaris beginning in 1972, bringing major advances in warheads and accuracy.  It was followed by Trident I in 1979, and Trident II in 1990. DevelopmentA development study for a longer range version of the Polaris missile achieved by enlarging it to the maximum possible size allowed by existing launch tubes started in 1963.  Tests had already shown that Polaris missiles could be operated without problems in launch tubes that had their fiberglass liners and locating rings removed. 

Private (rank)<====>24795<====>Private (rank)   A private is a soldier of the lowest military rank (equivalent to NATO Rank Grades OR-1 to OR-3 depending on the force served in). In modern military parlance, "private" is shortened to "Pte" in the United Kingdom and other (Commonwealth of Nations) countries and to "Pvt. " in the United States. EtymologyThe term derives from the medieval term "private soldiers" (a term still used in the British Army), denoting individuals who were either hired, conscripted, or mustered into service by a feudal nobleman commanding a battle group of an army.  The usage of "private" dates from the 18th century. 

Proclus<====>24797<====>Proclus    Proclus Lycaeus ( ; 8 February 412 – 17 April 485 AD), called the Successor (Greek  , Próklos ho Diádokhos), was a Greek Neoplatonist philosopher, one of the last major classical philosophers (see Damascius).  He set forth one of the most elaborate and fully developed systems of Neoplatonism.  He stands near the end of the classical development of philosophy, and was very influential on Western medieval philosophy (Greek and Latin).  BiographyProclus was born on February 8, 412 AD (his birth date is deduced from a horoscope cast by a disciple, Marinus) in Constantinople to a family of high social status in Lycia (his father Patricius was a high legal official, very important in the Byzantine Empire's court system) and raised in Xanthus. 

Production team<====>24799<====>Production team  A production team is the group of technical staff who produce a play, television show, recording, or film.   Generally the term refers to all individuals responsible for the technical aspects of creating of a particular product, regardless of where in the process their expertize is required, or how long they are involved in the project.   For example, in a theatrical performance, the production team includes not only the running crew, but also the theatrical producer, designers and theatre direction. A production company in filmmaking is composed of a film crew and a television crew in video production. 

Pinconning cheese<====>24801<====>Pinconning cheese Pinconning cheese is an aged yellow Colby-style, semi-soft whole cow's milk cheese named for Pinconning, Michigan, in the United States, where it was first produced.  It was developed by Dan Horn in 1915 as an aged version of Colby.   Pinconning cheese is produced at several plants around Michigan and the United States. Pinconning cheese's flavor and texture are unusual; rich and creamy with an open texture.   It is typically eaten instead of Cheddar and Colby, and serves well in macaroni and cheese or in soufflés.   Other products made from Pinconning cheese are cheese spreads in many flavors and the mild, squeaky curds are a local favorite. 

Prophet<====>24805<====>Prophet In religion, a prophet is an individual who has been contacted by a divine being in order to speak on the entity's behalf, serving as an intermediary with humanity by delivering messages or teachings from the supernatural source to other people.    The message that the prophet conveys is called a prophecy, which transports—at least in Judaism—a message beyond mere pagan soothsaying, augury, divination, or forecasting, and, most prominently in the neviim of the Tanakh, often comprises issues of social justice. Claims of prophethood have existed in many cultures through history, including Judaism, Christianity, Islam, in Ancient Greek Philosophy, Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, and many others. 

Pleading<====>24807<====>Pleading  In law as practiced in countries that follow the English models, a pleading is a formal written statement of a party's claims or defenses to another party's claims in a civil action.  The parties' pleadings in a case define the issues to be adjudicated in the action. The Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) govern pleading in England and Wales.  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern pleading in United States federal courts.  Each state in the United States has its own statutes and rules that govern pleading in the courts of that state. ExamplesIn the United States, a complaint is the first pleading filed by a plaintiff which initiates a lawsuit. 

Personal Communications Service<====>24808<====>Personal Communications Service At the most basic level, Personal Communications Service (PCS) describes a set of wireless communications capabilities which allows some combination of terminal mobility, personal mobility, and service profile management.   More specifically, PCS refers to any of several types of wireless voice or wireless data communications systems, typically incorporating digital technology, providing services similar to advanced cellular mobile or paging services.  In addition, PCS can also be used to provide other wireless communications services, including services which allow people to place and receive communications while away from their home or office, as well as wireless communications to homes, office buildings and other fixed locations. 

Polaris Sales Agreement<====>24815<====>Polaris Sales Agreement    The Polaris Sales Agreement was a treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom which began the UK Polaris programme.  The agreement was signed on 6 April 1963.  It formally arranged the terms and conditions under which the Polaris missile system was provided to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom had been planning to buy the air-launched Skybolt missile to extend the operational life of the British V bombers, but the United States decided to cancel the Skybolt program in 1962 as it no longer needed the missile.  The crisis created by the cancellation prompted an emergency meeting between the President of the United States, John F. 

Proto-Indo-Europeans<====>24818<====>Proto-Indo-Europeans The Proto-Indo-Europeans were the prehistoric people of Eurasia who spoke Proto-Indo-European (PIE), the ancestor of the Indo-European languages according to linguistic reconstruction. Knowledge of them comes chiefly from that reconstruction, along with material evidence from archaeology and archaeogenetics.  The Proto-Indo-Europeans likely lived during the late Neolithic, or roughly the 4th millennium BC.  Mainstream scholarship places them in the forest-steppe zone immediately to the north of the western end of the Pontic-Caspian steppe in Central Europe.  Some archaeologists would extend the time depth of PIE to the middle Neolithic (5500 to 4500 BC) or even the early Neolithic (7500 to 5500 BC), and suggest alternative location hypotheses. 

Peter Mark Roget<====>24820<====>Peter Mark Roget   Peter Mark Roget FRS (  or  ; 18 January 1779 – 12 September 1869) was a British physician, natural theologian and lexicographer.   He is best known for publishing, in 1852, the Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases (Roget's Thesaurus), a classified collection of related words. BiographyPeter Mark Roget was born in London.  His obsession with list-making as a coping mechanism was well established by the time he was eight years old.   The son of a Swiss clergyman, Roget studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 1798. 

Pterodactylus<====>24823<====>Pterodactylus    Pterodactylus (   , from the  ,  , meaning "winged finger") is an extinct flying reptile genus of pterosaurs, whose members are popularly known as pterodactyls (  ).  It is currently thought to contain only a single species, Pterodactylus antiquus, the first pterosaur species to be named and identified as a flying reptile. The fossil remains of this species have been found primarily in the Solnhofen limestone of Bavaria, Germany, dated to the late Jurassic Period (early Tithonian), about 150. 8–148. 5 million years ago,    though more fragmentary remains have been tentatively identified from elsewhere in Europe and in Africa. 

Pterosaur<====>24824<====>Pterosaur  Pterosaurs ( ;   from the Greek "πτερόσαυρος", "pterosauros", meaning "winged lizard") were flying reptiles of the extinct clade or order Pterosauria.  They existed during most of the Mesozoic: from the late Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous (228 to 66 million years ago   ).  Pterosaurs are the earliest vertebrates known to have evolved powered flight.  Their wings were formed by a membrane of skin, muscle, and other tissues stretching from the ankles to a dramatically lengthened fourth finger.    Early species had long, fully toothed jaws and long tails, while later forms had a highly reduced tail, and some lacked teeth. 

Pteranodon<====>24825<====>Pteranodon   Pteranodon ( ; from Greek πτερόν ( pteron, "wing") and ἀνόδων (anodon, "toothless") is a genus of pterosaurs which included some of the largest known flying reptiles, with wingspans over  .  They lived during the late Cretaceous geological period of North America in present-day Kansas, Alabama, Nebraska, Wyoming, and South Dakota.  More fossil specimens of Pteranodon have been found than any other pterosaur, with about 1,200 specimens known to science, many of them well preserved with nearly complete skulls and articulated skeletons.  It was an important part of the animal community in the Western Interior Seaway. 

Passive voice<====>24826<====>Passive voice  Passive voice is a grammatical voice common in many languages.  In a clause with passive voice, the grammatical subject expresses the theme or patient of the main verb – that is, the person or thing that undergoes the action or has its state changed.This contrasts with active voice, in which the subject has the agent role.  For example, in the passive sentence "The tree was pulled down", the subject (the tree) denotes the patient rather than the agent of the action.  In contrast, the sentences "Someone pulled down the tree" and "The tree is down" are active sentences. 

Primitive recursive function<====>24829<====>Primitive recursive functionIn computability theory, primitive recursive functions are a class of functions that are defined using primitive recursion and composition as central operations and are a strict subset of the total µ-recursive functions (µ-recursive functions are also called partial recursive).  Primitive recursive functions form an important building block on the way to a full formalization of computability.   These functions are also important in proof theory. Most of the functions normally studied in number theory are primitive recursive.  For example, addition and division, the factorial and exponential function, and the function which returns the nth prime are all primitive recursive. 

Prime Minister of Japan<====>24833<====>Prime Minister of Japan    The   is the head of government of Japan.  The Prime Minister is appointed by the Emperor of Japan after being designated by the National Diet and must enjoy the confidence of the House of Representatives to remain in office.  He or she is the head of the Cabinet and appoints and dismisses the other Ministers of State.  The literal translation of the Japanese name for the office is Minister for the Comprehensive Administration of (or the Presidency over) the Cabinet. HistoryPrior to the adoption of the Meiji Constitution, Japan had in practice no written constitution. 

Protein targeting<====>24834<====>Protein targeting This article deals with protein targeting in eukaryotes except where noted. Protein targeting or protein sorting is the biological mechanism by which proteins are transported to the appropriate destinations in the cell or outside it.  Proteins can be targeted to the inner space of an organelle, different intracellular membranes, plasma membrane, or to exterior of the cell via secretion.  This delivery process is carried out based on information contained in the protein itself.  Correct sorting is crucial for the cell; errors can lead to diseases. == Targeting signals ==  Targeting signals are the pieces of information that enable the cellular transport machinery to correctly position a protein inside or outside the cell. 

Pinochle<====>24837<====>Pinochle Pinochle ( ) or binocle (sometimes pinocle, or penuchle) is a  trick-taking card game typically for two to four players and played with a 48-card deck.  It is derived from the card game bezique; players score points by trick-taking and also by forming combinations of cards into melds.  It is thus considered part of a "trick-and-meld" category which also includes the game belote.  Each hand is played in three phases: bidding, melds, and tricks.  The standard game today is called "partnership auction pinochle. "HistoryPinochle derives from the game bezique.   Its name comes from the French word binocle meaning "eyeglasses". 

Peptidoglycan<====>24838<====>Peptidoglycan Peptidoglycan, also known as murein, is a polymer consisting of sugars and amino acids that forms a mesh-like layer outside the plasma membrane of most bacteria, forming the cell wall.  The sugar component consists of alternating residues of β-(1,4) linked N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) .  Attached to the N-acetylmuramic acid is a peptide chain of three to five amino acids.  The peptide chain can be cross-linked to the peptide chain of another strand forming the 3D mesh-like layer.   Peptidoglycan serves a structural role in the bacterial cell wall, giving structural strength, as well as counteracting the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm. 

Pope Sixtus IV<====>24845<====>Pope Sixtus IV   Pope Sixtus IV (21 July 1414 – 12 August 1484), born Francesco della Rovere, was Pope from 9 August 1471 to his death in 1484.  His accomplishments as pope included building the Sistine Chapel and the creation of the Vatican Archives.  A patron of the arts, the group of artists that he brought together introduced the Early Renaissance into Rome with the first masterpieces of the city's new artistic age.   Sixtus aided the Spanish Inquisition, though he fought to prevent abuses therein, and annulled the decrees of the Council of Constance.  He was famed for his nepotism and was personally involved in the infamous Pazzi conspiracy. 

Panama Canal<====>24849<====>Panama Canal The Panama Canal ( ) is an artificial   waterway in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean.  The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a key conduit for international maritime trade.  There are locks at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal, 26 m (85 ft) above sea level, and then lower the ships at the other end.  The original locks are 34 m (110 ft) wide.  A third, wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016. 

Political fiction<====>24850<====>Political fiction Political fiction employs narrative to comment on political events, systems and theories.  Works of political fiction, such as political novels, often "directly criticize an existing society or present an alternative, even fantastic, reality".   The political novel overlaps with the social novel, proletarian novel, and social science fiction.  Plato's Republic, a Socratic dialogue written around 380 BC, has been one of the world's most influential works of philosophy and political theory, both intellectually and historically.    The Republic is concerned with justice (δικαιοσύνη), the order and character of the just city-state, and the just man. 

Potato chip<====>24851<====>Potato chip    A potato chip or crisp is a thin slice of potato that has been deep fried or baked until crunchy.  Potato chips are commonly served as a snack, side dish, or appetizer.  The basic chips are cooked and salted; additional varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including herbs, spices, cheeses, other natural flavors, artificial flavors and additives. Potato chips are a predominant part of the snack food and convenience food market in Western countries.  The global potato chip market generated total revenues of US$16. 49 billion in 2005.  This accounted for 35. 

Prohibition<====>24856<====>Prohibition Prohibition is the illegality of the manufacturing, storage in barrels or bottles, transportation, sale, possession, and consumption of alcohol including alcoholic beverages, or a period of time during which such illegality was enforced.  Drugs were a major factor in alcohol prohibition. HistoryThe earliest records of prohibition of alcohol date to the Xia Dynasty (ca.  2070 BC–ca.  1600 BC) in China.  Yu the Great, the first ruler of the Xia Dynasty, prohibited alcohol throughout the kingdom.   It was legalized again after his death, during the reign of his son Qi.  Another record was in the Code of Hammurabi (ca. 

Phenothiazine<====>24857<====>Phenothiazine Phenothiazine, abbreviated PTZ, is an organic compound that has the formula S(C 6 H 4 ) 2 NH and is related to the thiazine-class of heterocyclic compounds.   Although the parent compound has no uses, derivatives of phenothiazine are highly bioactive and have widespread use and rich history.  The derivative chlorpromazine revolutionized the field of psychiatry and allergy treatment.  An earlier derivative, methylene blue, was one of the first antimalarial drugs, and derivatives are under investigation as possible anti-infective drugs.   Phenothiazine is a prototypical pharmaceutical lead structure in medicinal chemistry. UsesPhenothiazine itself is only of theoretical interest, but its derivatives revolutionized psychiatry, other fields of medicine, and pest management. 

Pale Fire<====>24861<====>Pale Fire Pale Fire is a 1962 novel by Vladimir Nabokov.  The novel is presented as a 999-line poem titled "Pale Fire", written by the fictional poet John Shade, with a foreword and lengthy commentary written by Shade's neighbor and academic colleague, Charles Kinbote.  Together these elements form a narrative in which both fictional authors are central characters. Pale Fire has spawned a wide variety of interpretations and a large body of written criticism, which Finnish literary scholar Pekka Tammi estimated in 1995 as more than 80 studies.The Nabokov authority Brian Boyd has called it "Nabokov's most perfect novel",  and the critic Harold Bloom called it "the surest demonstration of his own genius . 

Preservative<====>24862<====>Preservative A preservative is a substance or a chemical that is added to products such as food, beverages, pharmaceutical drugs, paints, biological samples, cosmetics, wood, and many other products to prevent decomposition by microbial growth or by undesirable chemical changes.  In general, preservation is implemented in two modes, chemical and physical.  Chemical preservation entails adding chemical compounds to the product.  Physical preservation entails processes such as refrigeration or drying.  Erich Lück and Gert-Wolfhard von Rymon Lipinski "Foods, 3.  Food Additives" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.Preservative food additives reduce the risk of foodborne infections, decrease microbial spoilage, and preserve fresh attributes and nutritional quality. 

Proteobacteria<====>24863<====>Proteobacteria "Proteobacteria"  is a major phylum of gram-negative bacteria.  They include a wide variety of pathogens, such as Escherichia, Salmonella, Vibrio, Helicobacter, Yersinia, and many other notable genera.    Others are free-living (non-parasitic), and include many of the bacteria responsible for nitrogen fixation. Carl Woese established this grouping in 1987, calling it informally the "purple bacteria and their relatives".    Because of the great diversity of forms found in this group, it was named after Proteus, a Greek god of the sea capable of assuming many different shapes and is not named after the genus Proteus. 

Professional wrestling<====>24864<====>Professional wrestling  Professional wrestling (often shortened to pro wrestling or simply wrestling) is a form of performance art which combines athletics with theatrical performance.   It takes the form of events, held by touring companies, which mimic a title match combat sport.  The unique form of sport portrayed is fundamentally based on classical and "catch" wrestling, with modern additions of striking attacks, strength-based holds and throws and acrobatic maneuvers, much of these derive from the influence of various international martial arts.  An additional aspect of combat with improvised weaponry is sometimes included to varying degrees. The matches have predetermined outcomes to heighten entertainment value and all combative maneuvers are executed with the full cooperation of those involved and carefully performed in specific manners intended to lessen the chance of actual injury. 

Pauli matrices<====>24868<====>Pauli matricesIn mathematical physics and mathematics, the Pauli matrices are a set of three   complex matrices which are Hermitian and unitary. Usually indicated by the Greek letter sigma ( ), they are occasionally denoted by tau ( ) when used in connection with isospin symmetries.   They are \begin{align} \sigma_1 = \sigma_x &=   \begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0   \end{pmatrix} \\ \sigma_2 = \sigma_y &=   \begin{pmatrix}0&-i\\i&0   \end{pmatrix} \\ \sigma_3 = \sigma_z &=   \begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&-1   \end{pmatrix} \,. 

Pie menu<====>24869<====>Pie menu In computer interface design, a pie menu (also known as a radial menu) is a circular context menu where selection depends on direction.  It is a graphical control element.  A pie menu is made of several "pie slices" around an inactive center and works best with stylus input, and well with a mouse.  Pie slices are drawn with a hole in the middle for an easy way to exit the menu. Pie menus work well with keyboard acceleration, particularly four and eight item menus, on the cursor keys and the number pad.  A goal of pie menus is to provide a smooth, reliable gestural style of interaction for novices and experts. 

Pollution<====>24872<====>Pollution   Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change.   Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat or light.  Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants.  Pollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint source pollution. In 2015, pollution killed 9 million people in the world.   HistoryAir pollution has always accompanied civilizations.  Pollution started from prehistoric times when man created the first fires.  According to a 1983 article in the journal Science, "soot" found on ceilings of prehistoric caves provides ample evidence of the high levels of pollution that was associated with inadequate ventilation of open fires. 

Pole weapon<====>24873<====>Pole weaponA pole weapon or pole arm is a close combat weapon in which the main fighting part of the weapon is fitted to the end of a long shaft, typically of wood, thereby extending the user's effective range.  Spears, glaives, poleaxes, halberds, and naginata are all varieties of pole arms. The purpose of using pole weapons is either to extend reach or to increase leverage (thanks to hands moving freely on a pole) and thus increase striking power.  Because they contain relatively little metal, pole arms are cheap to make.  This has made them the favored weapon of peasant levies and peasants in rebellion the world over. 

Personal jurisdiction<====>24875<====>Personal jurisdiction Personal jurisdiction is a court's jurisdiction over the parties to a lawsuit, as opposed to subject-matter jurisdiction, which is jurisdiction over the law and facts involved in the suit.  If a court does not have personal jurisdiction over a party, its rulings or decrees cannot be enforced upon that party, except by comity; i. e. , to the extent that the sovereign having jurisdiction over the party allows the court to enforce them upon that party.  A court that has personal jurisdiction has both the authority to rule on the law and facts of a suit and the power to enforce its decision upon a party to the suit. 

Pell's equation<====>24877<====>Pell's equationPell's equation (also called the Pell–Fermat equation) is any Diophantine equation of the form x^2-ny^2=1\, where n is a given positive nonsquare integer and integer solutions are sought for x and y.  In Cartesian coordinates, the equation has the form of a hyperbola; solutions occur wherever the curve passes through a point whose x and y coordinates are both integers, such as the trivial solution with x = 1 and y = 0.   Joseph Louis Lagrange proved that, as long as n is not a perfect square, Pell's equation has infinitely many distinct integer solutions.  These solutions may be used to accurately approximate the square root of n by rational numbers of the form x/y. 

Telephone card<====>24879<====>Telephone card A telephone card, calling card or phonecard for short, is a credit card size plastic or paper card, used to pay for telephone services (often international or long distance calling).  It is not necessary to have the physical card except with a stored-value system; knowledge of the access telephone number to dial and the PIN is sufficient.  Standard cards which can be purchased and used without any sort of account facility give a fixed amount of credit and are discarded when used up; rechargeable cards can be topped up, or collect payment in arrears.  The system for payment and the way in which the card is used to place a telephone call vary from card to card. 

Philips CD-i<====>24883<====>Philips CD-i   The Philips CD-i (an abbreviation of Compact Disc Interactive) is an interactive multimedia CD player developed and marketed by Royal Philips Electronics N. V. , who supported it from December 1991 into the late 1990s.  It was created to provide more functionality than an audio CD player or game console, but at a lower price than a personal computer with a CD-ROM drive at the time.  The cost savings were due to the lack of a floppy drive, keyboard, mouse, and monitor (a standard television is used), and less operating system software.  "CD-i" also refers to the multimedia Compact Disc standard used by the CD-i console, also known as Green Book, which was developed by Philips and Sony. 

Peppered moth<====>24884<====>Peppered moth  The peppered moth (Biston betularia) is a temperate species of night-flying moth.Peppered moth evolution is an example of population genetics and natural selection.    DescriptionThe wingspan is 55mm.  median (45–62 mm. ) It is relatively stout-bodied, with forewings relatively narrow-elongate.  The wings are white, "peppered" with black, and with more or less distinct cross lines, also black.  The black speckling varies in amount, in some examples it is almost absent, whilst in others it is so dense that the wings appear to be black sprinkled with white.  The antennae of males are strongly bipectinate. 

Power Macintosh<====>24886<====>Power Macintosh  The Power Macintosh, later Power Mac, is a family of personal computers that were designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer, Inc.   as part of its Macintosh brand from March 1994 until August 2006.  Described by MacWorld Magazine as "The most important technical evolution of the Macintosh since the Mac II debuted in 1987,"    the Power Macintosh was Apple's first computer to use a PowerPC processor.   Software written for the Motorola 68030 and 68040 processors that were used in Macintoshes up to that point would not run on the PowerPC natively, so a Mac 68k emulator was included with System 7. 

Promoter (genetics)<====>24888<====>Promoter (genetics) In genetics, a promoter is a region of DNA that initiates transcription of a particular gene.  Promoters are located near the transcription start sites of genes, on the same strand and upstream on the DNA (towards the 5' region of the sense strand). Promoters can be about 100–1000 base pairs long.  OverviewFor transcription to take place, the enzyme that synthesizes RNA, known as RNA polymerase, must attach to the DNA near a gene.  Promoters contain specific DNA sequences such as response elements that provide a secure initial binding site for RNA polymerase and for proteins called transcription factors that recruit RNA polymerase. 

Adobe Photoshop<====>24893<====>Adobe Photoshop    Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Systems for macOS and Windows. Photoshop was created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll.  Since then, it has become the de facto industry standard in raster graphics editing, such that the word "photoshop" has become a verb as in "to Photoshop an image," "photoshopping" and "photoshop contest", though Adobe discourages such use.   It can edit and compose raster images in multiple layers and supports masks, alpha compositing and several color models including RGB, CMYK, CIELAB, spot color and duotone. 

PaintShop Pro<====>24894<====>PaintShop Pro  PaintShop Pro (PSP) is a raster and vector graphics editor for Microsoft Windows.  It was originally published by  Jasc Software.  In October 2004, Corel purchased Jasc Software and the distribution rights to Paint Shop Pro.  PSP functionality can be extended by Photoshop-compatible plugins. The X-numbered editions have been sold in two versions: PaintShop Pro, which is the basic editing program, and PaintShop Pro Ultimate, which bundles in other standalone programs, additional artistic tools and/or plugins.  The particular bundled programs have varied with each numbered version and have not been sold by Corel as separate products. 

Persuasion<====>24897<====>Persuasion    Persuasion is an umbrella term of influence.   Persuasion can attempt to influence a person's beliefs, attitudes, intentions, motivations, or behaviors.   In business,persuasion is a process aimed at changing a person's (or a group's) attitude or behavior toward some event, idea, object, or other person(s), by using written or spoken words to convey information, feelings, or reasoning, or a combination thereof.   Persuasion is also an often used tool in the pursuit of personal gain, such as election campaigning, giving a sales pitch,  or in trial advocacy.  Persuasion can also be interpreted as using one's personal or positional resources to change people's behaviors or attitudes. 

Prime Minister of Israel<====>24898<====>Prime Minister of Israel   The Prime Minister of Israel ( , Rosh HaMemshala, lit.  Head of the Government, Hebrew acronym:  ;  , Ra'īs al-Ḥukūma) is the head of government of Israel and the most powerful figure in Israeli politics.  Although the President of Israel is the country's head of state, the president's powers are largely ceremonial; the prime minister holds most of the real power.  The official residence of the prime minister, Beit Rosh Hamemshala is in Jerusalem.  The current prime minister is Benjamin Netanyahu of Likud, the ninth person to hold the position (excluding caretakers). 

President of France<====>24899<====>President of France   The President of the French Republic ( ,  ) is the executive head of state of France in the French Fifth Republic.  In French terms, the Presidency is the supreme magistracy of the country. The powers, functions and duties of prior presidential offices, and their relation with the Prime Minister and Cabinet, have over time differed with the various French constitutions since 1848 (the final end of the French Monarchy). The President of the French Republic is also the ex officio Co-Prince of Andorra, Grand Master of the Légion d'honneur and the Ordre national du Mérite, and honorary proto-canon of the Basilica of St. 

Plastic explosive<====>24900<====>Plastic explosive Plastic explosive is a soft and hand-moldable solid form of explosive material.  Within the field of explosives engineering, plastic explosives are also known as putty explosives.    Plastic explosives are especially suited for explosive demolition.  Common plastic explosives include Semtex and C-4.  The first discovered plastic explosive was gelignite in 1875, invented by Alfred Nobel. UsagePlastic explosives are especially suited for explosive demolition of obstacles and fortifications by engineers, combat engineers and criminals as they can be easily formed into the best shapes for cutting structural members and have a high enough velocity of detonation and density for metal cutting work. 

Post-structuralism<====>24902<====>Post-structuralism    Post-structuralism is associated with the works of a series of mid-20th-century French and continental philosophers and critical theorists who came to international prominence in the 1960s and 1970s.  Bensmaïa, Réda Poststructuralism, article published in Kritzman, Lawrence (ed. ) The Columbia History of Twentieth-Century French Thought, Columbia University Press, 2005, pp. 92-93  Mark Poster (1988) Critical theory and poststructuralism: in search of a context, section Introduction: Theory and the problem of Context, pp. 5-6  Merquior, J.

Peyton Randolph<====>24905<====>Peyton Randolph  Peyton Randolph (September 10, 1721 – October 22, 1775) was a planter and public official from the Colony of Virginia.  He served as Speaker of the Virginia House of Burgesses, president of Virginia Conventions, and the first President of the Continental Congress.   Early lifeRandolph was born in Tazewell Hall,   Williamsburg, Virginia,  to a prominent family.  His parents were Sir John Randolph,  the son of William Randolph, and Susanna Beverley, the daughter of Peter Beverley; his brother was John Randolph.  Peyton Randolph was 16  when his father died. 

Product topology<====>24910<====>Product topology In topology and related areas of mathematics, a product space is the cartesian product of a family of topological spaces equipped with a natural topology called the product topology.   This topology differs from another, perhaps more obvious, topology called the box topology, which can also be given to a product space and which agrees with the product topology when the product is over only finitely many spaces.   However, the product topology is "correct" in that it makes the product space a categorical product of its factors, whereas the box topology is too fine; this is the sense in which the product topology is "natural". 

Playdia<====>24913<====>Playdia The   (developed under the codename "BA-X" ) is a home video game console released exclusively in Japan in 1994  at the initial price of ¥24,800.   It was intended for a young audience and, like many consoles of the era (e. g.  the LaserActive and the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer), was marketed more as a multimedia home entertainment system than as a dedicated gaming console,  with anime quiz software and edutainment making up most of the game library.   The Playdia uses a single infrared joypad with simple controls.  Bandai, the Playdia's manufacturer, was the only software publisher to support this console (except for VAP who published Ie Naki Ko - Suzu no Sentaku instead of Bandai). 

Pidgin<====>24915<====>Pidgin A pidgin, or pidgin language, is a grammatically simplified means of communication that develops between two or more groups that do not have a language in common: typically, a mixture of simplified languages or a simplified primary language with other languages' elements included.  It is most commonly employed in situations such as trade, or where both groups speak languages different from the language of the country in which they reside (but where there is no common language between the groups).  Fundamentally, a pidgin is a simplified means of linguistic communication, as it is constructed impromptu, or by convention, between individuals or groups of people.

Physically, it is one of the university's larger colleges, with buildings from almost every century since its founding, as well as extensive gardens.   the college has a financial endowment of £67 million.   Pembroke has a level of academic performance among the highest of all the Cambridge colleges; in 2013, 2014 and 2016 Pembroke was placed second in the Tompkins Table. 

Prime ideal<====>24928<====>Prime ideal  In algebra, a prime ideal is a subset of a ring that shares many important properties of a prime number in the ring of integers.    The prime ideals for the integers are the sets that contain all the multiples of a given prime number, together with the zero ideal. Primitive ideals are prime, and prime ideals are both primary and semiprime. Prime ideals for commutative ringsAn ideal   of a commutative ring   is prime if it has the following two properties:If   and   are two elements of   such that their product   is an element of  , then   is in   or   is in  ,  is not equal to   for the whole ring. 

PC-FX<====>24929<====>PC-FX  The   is a 32-bit home video game console made by NEC Home Electronics.  It was released in Japan on December 23, 1994, just weeks after Sony's PlayStation and a month after the Sega Saturn.  It is the successor to the PC Engine, known as TurboGrafx-16 in North America. Unlike its predecessor, the PC-FX was only released in Japan.  The console is shaped like a tower PC and was meant to be similarly upgradeable.  However the PC-FX lacked a 3D polygon-based graphics chip which rendered the system underpowered in comparison to its competitors. 

Psychotherapy<====>24931<====>Psychotherapy   Psychotherapy is the use of psychological methods, particularly when based on regular personal interaction, to help a person change and overcome problems in desired ways.  Psychotherapy aims to improve an individual's well-being and mental health, to resolve or mitigate troublesome behaviors, beliefs, compulsions, thoughts, or emotions, and to improve relationships and social skills.  Certain psychotherapies are considered evidence-based for treating some diagnosed mental disorders.  Others have been criticized as pseudoscience. There are over a thousand different psychotherapy techniques, some being minor variations, while others are based on very different conceptions of psychology, ethics (how to live) or techniques.

Polywater<====>24933<====>PolywaterPolywater was a hypothesized polymerized form of water that was the subject of much scientific controversy during the late 1960s.  By 1969 the popular press had taken notice and sparked fears of a "polywater gap" in the USA. Increased press attention also brought with it increased scientific attention, and as early as 1970 doubts about its authenticity were being circulated.  By 1973 it was found to be illusory, being just water with any number of common organic compounds contaminating it.  Today, polywater is best known as an example of pathological science.    BackgroundIn 1961, the Soviet physicist Nikolai Fedyakin, working at the Technological Institute of Kostroma, Russia, performed measurements on the properties of water which had been condensed in, or repeatedly forced through, narrow quartz capillary tubes. 

Pathological science<====>24935<====>Pathological science Pathological science is an area of research where "people are tricked into false results . . .  by subjective effects, wishful thinking or threshold interactions. "   The term was first  used by Irving Langmuir, Nobel Prize-winning chemist, during a 1953 colloquium at the Knolls Research Laboratory.  Langmuir said a pathological science is an area of research that simply will not "go away"—long after it was given up on as "false" by the majority of scientists in the field.  He called pathological science "the science of things that aren't so". Bart Simon lists it among practices pretending to be science: "categories . 

Pneumatic tube<====>24936<====>Pneumatic tubePneumatic tubes (or capsule pipelines; also known as pneumatic tube transport or PTT) are systems that propel cylindrical containers through networks of tubes by compressed air or by partial vacuum.  They are used for transporting solid objects, as opposed to conventional pipelines, which transport fluids.  Pneumatic tube networks gained acceptance in the late 19th and early 20th centuries for offices that needed to transport small, urgent packages (such as mail, paperwork, or money) over relatively short distances (within a building, or at most, within a city).  Some installations grew to great complexity, but were mostly superseded. 

Patrilineality<====>24942<====>Patrilineality Patrilineality, also known as the male line, the spear side  or agnatic kinship, is a common kinship system in which an individual's family membership derives from and is recorded through his or her father's lineage.  It generally involves the inheritance of property, rights, names or titles by persons related through male kin. A patriline ("father line") is a person's father, and additional ancestors, as traced only through males. In the BibleIn the Bible, family and tribal membership appears to be transmitted through the father.  For example, a person is considered to be a priest or Levite if his father is a priest or Levite, and the members of all the twelve tribes are called Israelites because their father is Israel (Jacob). 

Plate tectonics<====>24944<====>Plate tectonics Plate tectonics (from the Late Latin tectonicus, from the   "pertaining to building")  is a scientific theory describing the large-scale motion of seven large plates and the movements of a larger number of smaller plates of the Earth's lithosphere, since tectonic processes began on Earth between 3 and 3. 5 billion years ago.  The model builds on the concept of continental drift, an idea developed during the first decades of the 20th century.  The geoscientific community accepted plate-tectonic theory after seafloor spreading was validated in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The lithosphere, which is the rigid outermost shell of a planet (the crust and upper mantle), is broken into tectonic plates. 

Philips Videopac + G7400<====>24946<====>Philips Videopac + G7400 The Philips Videopac+ G7400 is a video game console released in limited quantities in 1983,   and only in Europe; an American release as the Odyssey³ Command Center was planned but never occurred.   The G7400 was the successor to the Philips Videopac G7000, the European counterpart to the American Magnavox Odyssey².   The system featured excellently tailored background and foreground graphics.    The G7400 could play three types of games: all normal G7000 games, special G7000 games with additional high-res background graphics that would appear only when played on the G7400, and G7400-only games with high-res sprites and backgrounds. 

Pong<====>24947<====>Pong   Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games.  It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics.  The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972.  Allan Alcorn created Pong as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell.  Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari.  Surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game. Pong quickly became a success and was the first commercially successful video game, which helped to establish the video game industry along with the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. 

Post office<====>24949<====>Post office   A post office is a customer service facility forming part of a national postal system.   Post offices offer mail-related services such as acceptance of letters and parcels; provision of post office boxes; and sale of postage stamps, packaging, and stationery.  In addition, many post offices offer additional services: providing and accepting government forms (such as passport applications), processing government services and fees (such as road tax), and banking services (such as savings accounts and money orders).   The chief administrator of a post office is called a postmaster. Prior to the advent of postal and ZIP codes, postal systems would route items to a specific post office for receipt or delivery. 

PlayStation 3<====>24951<====>PlayStation 3    The PlayStation 3 (PS3) is a home video game console developed by Sony Computer Entertainment.  It is the successor to PlayStation 2, and is part of the PlayStation brand of consoles.  It was first released on November 11, 2006, in Japan,    November 17, 2006, in North America, and March 23, 2007, in Europe and Australia.  The PlayStation 3 mainly competes against consoles such as Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles. 

Pelé<====>24953<====>Pelé   Edson Arantes do Nascimento ( ; born 23 October 1940), known as Pelé ( ), is a Brazilian retired professional footballer who played as a forward.  He is widely regarded as the greatest football player of all time.  In 1999, he was voted World Player of the Century by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS).  That same year, Pelé was elected Athlete of the Century by the International Olympic Committee.  According to the IFFHS, Pelé is the most successful league goal-scorer in the world, scoring 1281 goals in 1363 games, which included unofficial friendlies and tour games. 

Polycarp<====>24955<====>Polycarp  Polycarp ( , Polýkarpos;  ; AD 69   155) was a 2nd-century Christian bishop of Smyrna.According to the Martyrdom of Polycarp he died a martyr, bound and burned at the stake, then stabbed when the fire failed to touch him.   Polycarp is regarded as a saint and Church Father in the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Catholic, Anglican, and Lutheran churches.  His name 'Polycarp' means 'much fruit' in Greek. It is recorded by Irenaeus, who heard him speak in his youth, and by Tertullian,  that he had been a disciple of John the Apostle. 

Pacifism<====>24956<====>Pacifism   Pacifism is opposition to war, militarism, or violence.  The word pacifism was coined by the French peace campaigner Émile Arnaud (1864–1921) and adopted by other peace activists at the tenth Universal Peace Congress in Glasgow in 1901.   A related term is ahimsa (to do no harm), which is a core philosophy in Buddhism and Jainism.  While modern connotations are recent, having been explicated since the 19th century, ancient references abound. In modern times, interest was revived by Leo Tolstoy in his late works, particularly in The Kingdom of God Is Within You.  Mohandas Gandhi (1869–1948) propounded the practice of steadfast nonviolent opposition which he called "satyagraha", instrumental in its role in the Indian Independence Movement.

Proteinoid<====>24959<====>Proteinoid Proteinoids, or thermal proteins, are protein-like, often cross-linked molecules formed abiotically from amino acids.Sidney W.  Fox initially proposed that they may have been precursors to the first living cells (protocells).   The term was also in the 1960s to describe peptides that are shorter than twenty amino acids found in hydrolysed protein,  but this term is no longer commonly used.  HistoryIn trying to uncover the intermediate stages of abiogenesis, scientist Sidney W.  Fox in the 1950s and 1960s, studied the spontaneous formation of peptide structures under conditions that might plausibly have existed early in Earth's history. 

Permanent Court of International Justice<====>24960<====>Permanent Court of International Justice  The Permanent Court of International Justice, often called the World Court, existed from 1922 to 1946.  It was an international court attached to the League of Nations.  Created in 1920 (although the idea of an international court was several centuries old), the Court was initially well-received from states and academics alike, with many cases submitted to it for its first decade of operation.  With the heightened international tension of the 1930s, the Court became less used.  By a resolution from the League of Nations on 18 April 1946, the Court and the League both ceased to exist and were replaced by the International Court of Justice and the United Nations.

The story centers on a miner and his daughter and follows the lives and loves of the people in a mining camp in Gold Rush-era California.   Popular songs from the show included "Wand'rin' Star", "I Talk to the Trees" and "They Call the Wind Maria". The musical ran on Broadway in 1951 and in the West End in 1953.  In 1969 the film version also titled Paint Your Wagon was released. 

Pacific Overtures<====>24965<====>Pacific Overtures Pacific Overtures is a musical written by Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman.   The show is set in Japan beginning in 1853 and follows the difficult westernization of Japan, told from the point of view of the Japanese.  In particular, the story focuses on the lives of two friends caught in the change. The title of the work is drawn directly from text in a letter from Admiral Perry addressed to the Emperor dated July 7, 1853: "Many of the large ships-of-war destined to visit Japan have not yet arrived in these seas, though they are hourly expected; and the undersigned, as an evidence of his friendly intentions, has brought but four of the smaller ones, designing, should it become necessary, to return to Edo in the ensuing spring with a much larger force. 

Paradoxical intention<====>24967<====>Paradoxical intentionIn psychotherapy, paradoxical intention is the deliberate practice of a neurotic habit or thought, undertaken to identify and remove it.  The concept was termed by Dr.  Viktor Frankl, the founder of Logotherapy, who advocated for its use by patients experiencing severe forms of anxiety disorders.  Used as a counseling technique in which the counselor intensifies the client's emotional state in order to help the client understand the irrationality of the emotional reaction. It is also thought to derive its powerful effectiveness, not from understanding anything, as understanding often lacks the power to cause change, but from operating in alignment with and harnessing the power of the universal principle, "What you resist persists. 

Peter Stuyvesant<====>24968<====>Peter Stuyvesant  Peter Stuyvesant (English pronunciation /ˈstaɪv. ə. sənt/; in Dutch also Pieter and Petrus Stuyvesant; (1610 Mooney, James E.  "Stuyvesant, Peter" in   p. 1256 –1672) served as the last Dutch director-general of the colony of New Netherland from 1647 until it was ceded provisionally to the English in 1664, after which it was renamed New York.  He was a major figure in the early history of New York City and his name has been given to various landmarks and points of interest throughout the city (e. g.  Stuyvesant High School, Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village, Stuyvesant Plaza, Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood, etc. 

Phish<====>24969<====>Phish  Phish is an American rock band that was founded at the University of Vermont in Burlington, Vermont in 1983.  It is known for musical improvisation, extended jams, blending of genres, and a dedicated fan base.  The current line-up—guitarist and lead vocalist Trey Anastasio, bassist and vocalist Mike Gordon, drummer and vocalist Jon Fishman, and keyboardist and vocalist Page McConnell—performed together for 15 years before going on hiatus from October 7, 2000, to December 30, 2002.  They resumed touring from December 31, 2002 until August 15, 2004, when they announced that the Coventry Festival would be their last show. 

PA-RISC<====>24970<====>PA-RISC PA-RISC is an instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by Hewlett-Packard.  As the name implies, it is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture, where the PA stands for Precision Architecture.  The design is also referred to as HP/PA for Hewlett Packard Precision Architecture. The architecture was introduced on 26 February 1986, when the HP 3000 Series 930 and HP 9000 Model 840 computers were launched featuring the first implementation, the TS1.   PA-RISC has been succeeded by the Itanium (originally IA-64) ISA, jointly developed by HP and Intel.   HP stopped selling PA-RISC-based HP 9000 systems at the end of 2008 but supported servers running PA-RISC chips until 2013. 

Preacher (comics)<====>24971<====>Preacher (comics) Preacher is an American comic book series published by  Vertigo, an imprint of DC Comics.   The series was created by writer Garth Ennis and artist Steve Dillon with painted covers by Glenn Fabry. The series consists of 75 issues in total - 66 regular, monthly issues, five one-shot specials and a four-issue Preacher: Saint of Killers limited series.  The entire run has been collected in nine trade paperback editions.  The final monthly issue, number 66, was published in October 2000.

Preacher<====>24972<====>Preacher  A preacher is usually a person who delivers sermons or homilies on religious topics to an assembly of people.  Less common are preachers who preach on the street, or those whose message is not necessarily religious, but who preach components such as a moral or social worldview or philosophy. HistoryPreachers are common throughout most cultures.  They can take the form of a Christian minister on a Sunday morning, or an Islamic Imam.  A Muslim preacher in general is referred to as a dā‘ī, while one giving sermons on a Friday afternoon is called a khatib. 

Prime time<====>24973<====>Prime time  The prime time or the peak time is the block of broadcast programming taking place during the middle of the evening for television programming. The term prime time is often defined in terms of a fixed time period – for example (in the United States of America), from 19:00 to 22:00 (Central and Mountain Time) or 20:00 to 23:00 (Eastern and Pacific Time). AsiaBangladeshIn Bangladeshi Television Channels, the 19:00-to-22:00 time slot is known as Prime Time.   Several National Broadcasters like Maasranga Television, Gazi TV, Channel 9, Channel i broadcast their prime time shows from 20. 

Pelton wheel<====>24974<====>Pelton wheelThe Pelton wheel is an impulse-type water turbine.  It was invented by Lester Allan Pelton in the 1870s.    The Pelton wheel extracts energy from the impulse of moving water, as opposed to water's dead weight like the traditional overshot water wheel.  Many variations of impulse turbines existed prior to Pelton's design, but they were less efficient than Pelton's design.  Water leaving those wheels typically still had high speed, carrying away much of the dynamic energy brought to the wheels.   Pelton's paddle geometry was designed so that when the rim ran at half the speed of the water jet, the water left the wheel with very little speed; thus his design extracted almost all of the water's impulse energy which allowed for a very efficient turbine. 

Piezoelectricity<====>24975<====>PiezoelectricityPiezoelectricity   is the electric charge that accumulates in certain solid materials (such as crystals, certain ceramics, and biological matter such as bone, DNA and various proteins)    in response to applied mechanical stress.  The word piezoelectricity means electricity resulting from pressure and latent heat.  It is derived from the Greek    piezein, which means to squeeze or press, and   ēlektron, which means amber, an ancient source of electric charge.    Piezoelectricity was discovered in 1880 by French physicists Jacques and Pierre Curie.    The piezoelectric effect is understood as the linear electromechanical interaction between the mechanical and the electrical state in crystalline materials with no inversion symmetry. 

Product (mathematics)<====>24977<====>Product (mathematics)  In mathematics, a product is the result of multiplying, or an expression that identifies factors to be multiplied.   Thus, for instance, 6 is the product of 2 and 3 (the result of multiplication), and  x\cdot (2+x)  is the product of  x  and  (2+x)  (indicating that the two factors should be multiplied together). The order in which real or complex numbers are multiplied has no bearing on the product; this is known as the commutative law of multiplication.   When matrices or members of various other associative algebras are multiplied, the product usually depends on the order of the factors.

It is a connected and closed figure, composed of lower-dimensional polytopal elements: vertices, edges, faces (polygons), and cells (polyhedra).  Each face is shared by exactly two cells. The two-dimensional analogue of a 4-polytope is a polygon, and the three-dimensional analogue is a polyhedron. Topologically 4-polytopes are closely related to the uniform honeycombs, such as the cubic honeycomb, which tessellate 3-space; similarly the 3D cube is related to the infinite 2D square tiling. 

Punctuated equilibrium<====>24980<====>Punctuated equilibrium Punctuated equilibrium (also called punctuated equilibria) is a theory in evolutionary biology which proposes that once species appear in the fossil record they will become stable, showing little evolutionary change for most of their geological history.  This state is called stasis.  When significant evolutionary change occurs, the theory proposes that it is generally restricted to rare and geologically rapid events of branching speciation called cladogenesis.  Cladogenesis is the process by which a species splits into two distinct species, rather than one species gradually transforming into another.  Gould, Stephen Jay, & Eldredge, Niles (1977).  "Punctuated equilibria: the tempo and mode of evolution reconsidered. 

Pioneer 11<====>24981<====>Pioneer 11  Pioneer 11 (also known as Pioneer G) is a   robotic space probe launched by NASA on April 6, 1973 to study the asteroid belt, the environment around Jupiter and Saturn, solar wind and cosmic rays.   It was the first probe to encounter Saturn and the second to fly through the asteroid belt and by Jupiter.  Thereafter, Pioneer 11 became the second of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity that will allow them to leave the Solar System.  Due to power constraints and the vast distance to the probe, the last routine contact with the spacecraft was on September 30, 1995, and the last good engineering data was received on November 24, 1995. 

Psychometrics<====>24982<====>Psychometrics    Psychometrics is a field of study concerned with the theory and technique of psychological measurement.  As defined by National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME), psychometrics refers to psychological measurement.  Generally, it refers to the field in psychology and education that is devoted to testing, measurement, assessment, and related activities.  The field is concerned with the objective measurement of skills and knowledge, abilities, attitudes, personality traits, and educational achievement.  Some psychometric researchers focus on the construction and validation of assessment instruments such as questionnaires, tests, raters' judgments, and personality tests.  Others focus on research relating to measurement theory (e. 

Philosophy of education<====>24983<====>Philosophy of education Philosophy of education can refer either to the application of philosophy to the problem of education, examining definitions, goals and chains of meaning used in education by teachers, administrators and policymakers.  It can involve the examination of particular visions or approaches by researchers and policy-makers in education that often address contemporary debates and assumptions about innovations and practices in teaching and learning by considering the profession within broader philosophical or sociocultural contexts.    As an academic field, study involves "the philosophical study of education and its problems. . . its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those of philosophy". 

Personality psychology<====>24984<====>Personality psychology Personality psychology is a branch of psychology that studies personality and its variation among individuals.  Its areas of focus include:construction of a coherent picture of the individual and their major psychological processesinvestigation of individual psychological differencesinvestigation of human nature and psychological similarities between individuals"Personality" is a dynamic  and organized set of characteristics possessed by a person that uniquely  influences their environment, cognitions, emotions, motivations, and behaviors in various situations.  The word "personality" originates from the Latin persona, which means mask. Personality also refers to the pattern of thoughts, feelings, social adjustments, and behaviors consistently exhibited over time that strongly influences one's expectations, self-perceptions, values, and attitudes. 

Pronoun<====>24985<====>Pronoun   In linguistics and grammar, a pronoun (abbreviated  ) is a word that substitutes for a noun or noun phrase.  It is a particular case of a pro-form. Pronouns have traditionally been regarded as one of the parts of speech, but some modern theorists would not consider them to form a single class, in view of the variety of functions they perform.  Subtypes include personal pronouns, reflexive and reciprocal pronouns, possessive pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, relative pronouns, interrogative pronouns, and indefinite pronouns.   The use of pronouns often involves anaphora, where the meaning of the pronoun is dependent on an antecedent. 

Pelagianism<====>24986<====>Pelagianism  Pelagianism is the belief that original sin did not taint human nature and that mortal will is still capable of choosing good or evil without special divine aid.  This theological theory is named after the British monk Pelagius (354–420 or 440), although he denied, at least at some point in his life, many of the doctrines associated with his name.  Pelagius was identified as an Irishman by Saint Jerome.   Pelagius taught that the human will, as created with its abilities by God, was sufficient to live a sinless life, although he believed that God's grace assisted every good work. 

Patripassianism<====>24987<====>Patripassianism In Christian theology, patripassianism (as it is referred to in the Western church) or Sabellianism in the Eastern church (also known as modalism, modalistic monarchianism, or modal monarchism) is the nontrinitarian or anti-trinitarian belief that God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit are three different modes or aspects of one monadic God, as perceived by the believer, rather than three distinct persons within the Godhead – that there are no real or substantial differences between the three, such that there is no substantial identity for the Spirit or the Son.  In the West, this belief was known as patripassianism (from Latin patri- "father" and passio "suffering"), because the teaching required that since the God the Father had become directly incarnate in Christ, that God literally sacrificed Himself on the Cross. 

Psilanthropism<====>24988<====>PsilanthropismPsilanthropism is an approach to Christology which understands Jesus to be  human, the literal son of human parents.    The term derives from the combination of the Greek   (psilós), "plain," "mere" or "bare," and   (ánthrōpos) "human. " Psilanthropists generally deny both the virgin birth of Jesus, and his divinity. Historical figures such as Nestorius were not psilanthropists because they still maintained a divine component in their Christology.   Samuel Taylor Coleridge was, however, an example of a psilanthropist.   However, later in life Coleridge decisively rejected psilanthropism.  Early psilanthropism The term is sometimes used to describe Ebionitism, which was rejected by the ecumenical councils, especially in the First Council of Nicaea, which was convened to deal directly with the nature of Christ's divinity. 

Pendulum clock<====>24989<====>Pendulum clock A pendulum clock is a clock that uses a pendulum, a swinging weight, as its timekeeping element.   The advantage of a pendulum for timekeeping is that it is a harmonic oscillator; it swings back and forth in a precise time interval dependent on its length, and resists swinging at other rates.   From its invention in 1656 by Christiaan Huygens until the 1930s, the pendulum clock was the world's most precise timekeeper, accounting for its widespread use.Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries pendulum clocks in homes, factories, offices and railroad stations served as primary time standards for scheduling daily life, work shifts, and public transportation, and their greater accuracy allowed the faster pace of life which was necessary for the Industrial Revolution. 

Programmable logic controller<====>24992<====>Programmable logic controller  A programmable logic controller (PLC), or programmable controller is an industrial digital computer which has been ruggedized and adapted for the control of manufacturing processes, such as assembly lines, or robotic devices, or any activity that requires high reliability control and ease of programming and process fault diagnosis. They were first developed in the automobile industry to provide flexible, ruggedised and easily programmable controllers to replace hard-wired relays, timers and sequencers.  Since then they have been widely adopted as high-reliability automation controllers suitable for harsh environments.  A PLC is an example of a "hard" real-time system since output results must be produced in response to input conditions within a limited time, otherwise unintended operation will result.

Pretoria<====>25002<====>Pretoria    Pretoria is a city in the northern part of Gauteng, South Africa.  It is one of the country's three capital cities, serving as the seat of the executive branch of government (Cape Town is the legislative capital and Bloemfontein the judicial capital).  Pretoria has a reputation for being an academic city with three universities and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) located in its eastern suburbs, the city also hosts the South African Bureau of Standards making the city a hub for research.  Pretoria is the central part of the Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality which was formed by the amalgamation of several former local authorities including Centurion and Soshanguve. 

Psychiatrist<====>25004<====>Psychiatrist    A psychiatrist is a physician who specializes in psychiatry, the branch of medicine devoted to the diagnosis, prevention, study, and treatment of mental disorders.  Psychiatrists are medical doctors, unlike psychologists, and must evaluate patients to determine whether their symptoms are the result of a physical illness, a combination of physical and mental ailments, or strictly psychiatric. As part of the clinical assessment process, psychiatrists may employ a mental status examination; a physical examination; brain imaging such as a computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET) scan; and blood testing.  Psychiatrists prescribe medicine, and may also use psychotherapy, although the vast majority do medical management and refer to a psychologist or other specialized therapist for weekly to bi-monthly psychotherapy. 

Peano axioms<====>25005<====>Peano axiomsIn mathematical logic, the Peano axioms, also known as the Dedekind–Peano axioms or the Peano postulates, are a set of axioms for the natural numbers presented by the 19th century Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano.  These axioms have been used nearly unchanged in a number of metamathematical investigations, including research into fundamental questions of whether number theory is consistent and complete. The need to formalize arithmetic was not well appreciated until the work of Hermann Grassmann, who showed in the 1860s that many facts in arithmetic could be derived from more basic facts about the successor operation and induction. 

Procyon<====>25006<====>Procyon  Procyon (   ;   ), also designated Alpha Canis Minoris (α Canis Minoris, abbreviated Alpha CMi, α CMi), is the brightest star in the constellation of Canis Minor.  To the naked eye, it appears to be a single star, the eighth-brightest in the night sky with a visual apparent magnitude of 0. 34.   It is a binary star system, consisting of a white main-sequence star of spectral type F5 IV–V, named Procyon A, and a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type DQZ,  named Procyon B. 

Prisoner of war<====>25008<====>Prisoner of war A prisoner of war (POW, PoW, PW, P/W, WP, PsW, enemy prisoner of war (EPW) or "missing-captured"   ) is a person, whether combatant or non-combatant, who is held in custody by a belligerent power during or immediately after an armed conflict.  The earliest recorded usage of the phrase "prisoner of war" dates to 1660.  Compare   - "Captives taken in war have been called prisoners since mid-14c. ; phrase prisoner of war dates from 1670s".  Belligerents hold prisoners of war in custody for a range of legitimate and illegitimate reasons, such as isolating them from enemy combatants still in the field (releasing and repatriating them in an orderly manner after hostilities), demonstrating military victory, punishing them, prosecuting them for war crimes, exploiting them for their labour, recruiting or even conscripting them as their own combatants, collecting military and political intelligence from them, or indoctrinating them in new political or religious beliefs. 

Privacy<====>25009<====>Privacy  Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves, or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively.  The boundaries and content of what is considered private differ among cultures and individuals, but share common themes.  When something is private to a person, it usually means that something is inherently special or sensitive to them.  The domain of privacy partially overlaps security (confidentiality), which can include the concepts of appropriate use, as well as protection of information.  Privacy may also take the form of bodily integrity.  The right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasion of privacy by the government, corporations or individuals is part of many countries' privacy laws, and in some cases, constitutions. 

Proton–proton chain reaction<====>25010<====>Proton–proton chain reaction  The proton–proton chain reaction is one of the two (known) sets of fusion reactions by which stars convert hydrogen to helium.  It dominates in stars the size of the Sun or smaller.   (The other reaction is the CNO cycle, a catalytic cycle, which theoretical models suggest is the dominant source of energy in stars more massive than about 1. 4 times the mass of the Sun.  )In general, proton–proton fusion can occur only if the kinetic energy (i. e.  temperature) of the protons is high enough to overcome their mutual electrostatic or Coulomb repulsion. 

Plankton<====>25011<====>Plankton Plankton (singular plankter) are the diverse collection of organisms that live in large bodies of water and are unable to swim against a current.   They provide a crucial source of food to many large aquatic organisms, such as fish and whales. These organisms include bacteria, archaea, algae, protozoa and drifting or floating animals that inhabit—for example—the pelagic zone of oceans, seas, or bodies of fresh water.  Essentially, plankton are defined by their ecological niche rather than any phylogenetic or taxonomic classification. Though many planktonic species are microscopic in size, plankton includes organisms over a wide range of sizes, including large organisms such as jellyfish. 

Pi Day<====>25013<====>Pi Day    Pi Day is an annual celebration of the mathematical constant   (pi).  Pi Day is observed on March 14 (3/14 in the month/day date format) since 3, 1, and 4 are the first three significant digits of  .

Pauli effect<====>25018<====>Pauli effectThe Pauli effect is a term referring to the supposed tendency of technical equipment to encounter critical failure in the presence of certain people.  The term was coined after mysterious anecdotal stories involving Austrian theoretical physicist Wolfgang Pauli, describing numerous instances in which demonstrations involving equipment suffered technical problems only when he was present. The Pauli effect is not related with the Pauli exclusion principle, which is a bona fide physical phenomenon named after Pauli.  However the Pauli effect was humorously tagged as a second Pauli exclusion principle, according to which a functioning device and Wolfgang Pauli may not occupy the same room. 

Pat Mills<====>25020<====>Pat Mills    Pat Eamon Mills  (born 1949) is a British comics writer and editor who, along with John Wagner, revitalised British boys comics in the 1970s, and has remained a leading light in British comics ever since.  He has been called "the godfather of British comics".  His comics are notable for their violence and anti-authoritarianism.   He is best known for creating 2000 AD and playing a major part in the development of Judge Dredd. BiographyMills started his career as a sub-editor for D.  C.  Thomson & Co.

Pearl Index<====>25021<====>Pearl IndexThe Pearl Index, also called the Pearl rate, is the most common technique used in clinical trials for reporting the effectiveness of a birth control method.  Calculation and usage \mbox{Pearl-Index} = \frac{\mbox{Number of Pregnancies} \cdot 12} {\mbox{Number of Women}  \cdot \mbox{Number of Months}} \cdot 100 Three kinds of information are needed to calculate a Pearl Index for a particular study:The total number months or cycles of exposure by women in the study. The number of pregnancies. The reason for leaving the study (pregnancy or other reason). There are two calculation methods for determining the Pearl Index:In the first method, the relative number of pregnancies in the study is divided by the number of months of exposure, and then multiplied by 1200.

Plain text<====>25030<====>Plain text  In computing, plain text is the data (e. g.  file contents) that represent only characters of readable material but not its graphical representation nor other objects (images, etc. ).  It may also include a limited number of characters that control simple arrangement of text, such as line breaks or tabulation characters.  Plain text is different from formatted text, where style information is included, and from "binary files" in which some portions must be interpreted as binary objects (encoded integers, real numbers, images, etc. ). The encoding has traditionally been either ASCII, sometimes EBCDIC.  Unicode-based encodings such as UTF-8 and UTF-16 are gradually replacing the older ASCII derivatives limited to 7 or 8 bit codes. 

Presbyterian Church (USA)<====>25031<====>Presbyterian Church (USA)The Presbyterian Church (USA), or PC(USA), is a mainline Protestant Christian denomination in the United States.  A part of the Reformed tradition, it is the largest Presbyterian denomination in the U. S. , and known for its relatively progressive stance on doctrine.  The PC(USA) was established by the 1983 merger of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, whose churches were located in the Southern and border states, with the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, whose congregations could be found in every state.   The similarly named Presbyterian Church in America is a separate denomination whose congregations can also trace their history to the various schisms and mergers of Presbyterian churches in the United States. 

Piña colada<====>25033<====>Piña colada   The piña colada ( ; , "pineapple," and    , "strained") is a sweet cocktail made with rum, coconut cream or coconut milk, and pineapple juice, usually served either blended or shaken with ice.  It may be garnished with either a pineapple wedge, maraschino cherry, or both.  The piña colada has been the national drink of Puerto Rico since 1978.  OriginThe name piña colada literally means "strained pineapple", a reference to the freshly pressed and strained pineapple juice used in the drink's preparation. Two bartenders from Puerto Rico won a contest for the ownership of their national drink. 

PackBits<====>25034<====>PackBits PackBits is a fast, simple lossless compression scheme for run-length encoding of data. Apple introduced the PackBits format with the release of MacPaint on the Macintosh computer.  This compression scheme is one of the types of compression that can be used in TIFF-files.  TGA-files also use this RLE compression scheme, but treats data stream as pixels instead of bytes. A PackBits data stream consists of packets with a one-byte header followed by data.  The header is a signed byte; the data can be signed, unsigned, or packed (such as  MacPaint  pixels). In the following table, n is the value of the header byte as a signed integer. 

Pub rock (Australia)<====>25036<====>Pub rock (Australia)   Pub rock is a style of Australian rock and roll popular throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and still influencing contemporary Australian music in the 2000s (decade).  The term came from the venues where most of these bands originally played — inner-city and suburban pubs.  These often noisy, hot, small and crowded venues were not always ideal as music venues and favoured loud, simple songs based on drums and electric guitar riffs. The Australian version of pub rock incorporates hard rock, blues rock, and/or progressive rock.  In the Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop (1999), Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane described how, in the early 1970s, Billy Thorpe & The Aztecs, Blackfeather, and Buffalo pioneered Australia's pub rock movement. 

Phonation<====>25037<====>PhonationThe term phonation has slightly different meanings depending on the subfield of phonetics.   Among some phoneticians, phonation is the process by which the vocal folds produce certain sounds through quasi-periodic vibration.  This is the definition used among those who study laryngeal anatomy and physiology and speech production in general.  Phoneticians in other subfields, such as linguistic phonetics, call this process voicing, and use the term phonation to refer to any oscillatory state of any part of the larynx that modifies the airstream, of which voicing is just one example.  Voiceless and supra-glottal phonations are included under this definition. 

Principal ideal domain<====>25039<====>Principal ideal domainIn abstract algebra, a principal ideal domain, or PID, is an integral domain in which every ideal is principal, i. e. , can be generated by a single element.  More generally, a principal ideal ring is a nonzero commutative ring whose ideals are principal, although some authors (e. g. , Bourbaki) refer to PIDs as principal rings.  The distinction is that a principal ideal ring may have zero divisors whereas a principal ideal domain cannot. Principal ideal domains are thus mathematical objects that behave somewhat like the integers, with respect to divisibility: any element of a PID has a unique decomposition into prime elements (so an analogue of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic holds); any two elements of a PID have a greatest common divisor (although it may not be possible to find it using the Euclidean algorithm). 

Pioneer program<====>25040<====>Pioneer program The Pioneer program is a series of United States unmanned space missions that were designed for planetary exploration.  There were a number of such missions in the program, but the most notable were Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11, which explored the outer planets and left the solar system.  Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 carry a golden plaque, depicting a man and a woman and information about the origin and the creators of the probes, should any extraterrestrials find them someday. NamingCredit for naming the first probe has been attributed to Stephen A.  Saliga, who had been assigned to the Air Force Orientation Group, Wright-Patterson AFB, as chief designer of Air Force exhibits.

Prayer<====>25042<====>Prayer   Prayer (from the Latin precari "to ask earnestly, beg, entreat")  is an invocation or act that seeks to activate a rapport with an object of worship through deliberate communication. Prayer can be a form of religious practice,  may be either individual or communal and take place in public or in private.  It may involve the use of words, song or complete silence.  When language is used, prayer may take the form of a hymn, incantation, formal creedal statement, or a spontaneous utterance in the praying person.  There are different forms of prayer such as petitionary prayer, prayers of supplication, thanksgiving, and praise. 

Punjabi language<====>25044<====>Punjabi languagePunjabi ( ;  Gurmukhi:    ; Shahmukhi:    )    is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by over 100 million native speakers worldwide, ranking as the 10th most widely spoken language (2015)  in the world.  It is the native language of the Punjabi people, who associate with the historical Punjab region of India and Pakistan.  Among Indo-European languages, it is unusual in having lexical tone.    Punjabi is the most widely spoken language in Pakistan,  the 11th most widely spoken in India, and the third most-spoken native language in the Indian Subcontinent.

Power associativity<====>25054<====>Power associativityIn abstract algebra, power associativity is a property of a binary operation which is a weak form of associativity. An algebra (or more generally a magma) is said to be power-associative if the subalgebra generated by any element is associative.  Concretely, this means that if an element x is multiplied by itself several times, it doesn't matter in which order the multiplications are carried out, so for instance  . Every associative algebra is power-associative, but so are all other alternative algebras (like the octonions, which are non-associative) and even some non-alternative algebras like the sedenions and Okubo algebras. 

Pierre de Coubertin<====>25055<====>Pierre de Coubertin   Pierre de Frédy, Baron de Coubertin ( ; 1 January 1863 – 2 September 1937, born Pierre de Frédy, also known as Baron de Coubertin) was a French educator and historian, and founder of the International Olympic Committee.  He is considered the father of the modern Olympic Games.  Born into a French aristocratic family, he became an academic and studied a broad range of topics, most notably education and history. The Pierre de Coubertin medal (also known as the Coubertin medal or the True Spirit of Sportsmanship medal) is an award given by the International Olympic Committee to athletes  that demonstrate the spirit of sportsmanship in the Olympic Games. 

Polish notation<====>25056<====>Polish notation  Polish notation (PN), also known as normal Polish notation (NPN),    Łukasiewicz notation, Warsaw notation, Polish prefix notation or simply prefix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators precede their operands, in contrast to reverse Polish notation (RPN) in which operators follow their operands.  It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands.  The description "Polish" refers to the nationality of logician Jan Łukasiewicz,   (Reprinted by Garland Publishing in 1987.   )  who invented Polish notation in 1924.   The term Polish notation is sometimes taken (as the opposite of infix notation) to also include reverse Polish notation. 

Primary school<====>25058<====>Primary school   A primary school (or elementary school in American English and often in Canadian English) is a school in which children receive primary or elementary education from the age of about five to twelve, coming  after preschool and before secondary school.  (In some countries there is an intermediate stage of middle school between primary and secondary education. ) Primary SchoolsIn most parts of the world, primary education is the first stage of compulsory education, and is normally available without charge, but may be offered in a fee-paying independent school.  The term grade school is sometimes used in the US, although this term may refer to both primary education and secondary education. 

Piedmont<====>25061<====>Piedmont   Piedmont (   ;  ,  ; Piedmontese, Occitan and  ;  ) is a region in northwest Italy, one of the 20 regions of the country.   It borders the Liguria region to the south, the Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna regions to the east and the Aosta Valley region to the northwest; it also borders France to the west and Switzerland to the northeast.  It has an area of   and a population of 4,396,293 as of 31 July 2016.  The capital of Piedmont is Turin. ToponymyThe name Piedmont comes from medieval Latin Pedemontium or Pedemontis, i. 

Palestinian views on the peace process<====>25062<====>Palestinian views on the peace process Palestinian views on the peace process with Israel are wide ranging.   The goal that unites Palestinians is the establishment of a Palestinian state where, among other things, Palestinian refugees may resettle.   Some Palestinians want that state to be established in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whereas other Palestinians want that state to replace the State of Israel. BackgroundPalestinians have held diverse views and perceptions of the peace process.  A key starting point for understanding these views is an awareness of the differing objectives sought by advocates of the Palestinian cause. 

Product ring<====>25063<====>Product ringIn mathematics, it is possible to combine several rings into one large product ring.  This is done as follows: if I is some index set and R i  is a ring for every i in I, then the cartesian product   can be turned into a ring by defining the operations coordinate-wise. The resulting ring is called a direct product of the rings R i . ExamplesAn important example is the ring Z/nZ of integers modulo n.  If n is written as a product of prime powers (see fundamental theorem of arithmetic), n=p_1^{n_1}\  p_2^{n_2}\ \cdots\ p_k^{n_k}, where the p i  are distinct primes, then Z/nZ is naturally isomorphic to the product ring \mathbf{Z}/p_1^{n_1}\mathbf{Z} \ \times \ \mathbf{Z}/p_2^{n_2}\mathbf{Z} \ \times \ \cdots \ \times \ \mathbf{Z}/p_k^{n_k}\mathbf{Z}. 

Posthumanism<====>25064<====>Posthumanism   Posthumanism or post-humanism (meaning "after humanism" or "beyond humanism") is a term with at least seven definitions according to philosopher Francesca Ferrando:   Antihumanism: any theory that is critical of traditional humanism and traditional ideas about humanity and the human condition.  Cultural posthumanism: a branch of cultural theory critical of the foundational assumptions of humanism and its legacy    that examines and questions the historical notions of "human" and "human nature", often challenging typical notions of human subjectivity and embodiment Miah, A.

Parameter<====>25065<====>Parameter  A parameter (from the Ancient Greek  , para: "beside", "subsidiary"; and  , metron: "measure"), generally, is any characteristic that can help in defining or classifying a particular system (meaning an event, project, object, situation, etc. ).  That is, a parameter is an element of a system that is useful, or critical, when identifying the system, or when evaluating its performance, status, condition, etc. Parameter has more specific meanings within various disciplines, including mathematics, computing and computer programming, engineering, statistics, logic and linguistics.  Within and across these fields, careful distinction must be maintained of the different usages of the term parameter and of other terms often associated with it, such as argument,  property, axiom, variable, function, attribute, etc. 

Paavo Nurmi<====>25071<====>Paavo Nurmi   Paavo Johannes Nurmi ( ; 13 June 1897 – 2 October 1973) was a Finnish middle- and long-distance runner.  He was nicknamed the "Flying Finn" as he dominated distance running in the early 20th century.  Nurmi set 22 official world records at distances between 1500 metres and 20 kilometres, and won nine gold and three silver medals in his twelve events in the Olympic Games.  At his peak, Nurmi was undefeated at distances from 800 m upwards for 121 races.  Throughout his 14-year career, he remained unbeaten in cross country events and the 10,000 m. 

Purple Heart<====>25072<====>Purple Heart   The Purple Heart is a United States military decoration awarded in the name of the President to those wounded or killed while serving, on or after April 5, 1917, with the U. S.  military.  With its forerunner, the Badge of Military Merit, which took the form of a heart made of purple cloth, the Purple Heart is the oldest military award still given to U. S.  military members – the only earlier award being the obsolete Fidelity Medallion.  The National Purple Heart Hall of Honor is located in New Windsor, New York. 

Polyatomic ion<====>25073<====>Polyatomic ionA polyatomic ion, also known as a molecular ion, is a charged chemical species (ion) composed of two or more atoms covalently bonded or of a metal complex that can be considered to be acting as a single unit.  The prefix poly- means "many," in Greek, but even ions of two atoms are commonly referred to as polyatomic.  In older literature, a polyatomic ion is also referred to as a radical, and less commonly, as a radical group.  In contemporary usage, the term radical refers to free radicals that are (not necessarily charged) species with an unpaired electron. 

Persecution of Christians<====>25074<====>Persecution of Christians   The persecution of Christians can be historically traced from the first century of the Christian era based on the biblical account of Jesus to the present day.  Early Christians were persecuted for their faith at the hands of both Jews from whose religion Christianity arose and the Romans who controlled many of the lands across which early Christianity was spread.  Early in the fourth century, a form of the religion was legalized by the Edict of Milan, and it eventually became the State church of the Roman Empire. Christian missionaries as well as converts to Christianity have been the target of persecution ever since the emergence of Christianity, sometimes to the point of being martyred for their faith. 

Pet<====>25079<====>Pet A pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, protection, or entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock, or laboratory animal.   Popular pets are often noted for their attractive appearances and their loyal or playful personalities. Pets provide their owners (or guardians   ) both physical and emotional benefits.  Walking a dog can supply both the human and pet with exercise, fresh air, and social interaction.  Pets can give companionship to elderly adults who do not have adequate social interaction with other people, as well as to other people who are living alone. 

Photograph<====>25080<====>Photograph    A photograph or photo is an image created by light falling on a light-sensitive surface, usually photographic film or an electronic medium such as a CCD or a CMOS chip.  Most photographs are created using a camera, which uses a lens to focus the scene's visible wavelengths of light into a reproduction of what the human eye would see.  The process and practice of creating photographs is called photography.  The word "photograph" was coined in 1839 by Sir John Herschel and is based on the Greek φῶς (phos), meaning "light", and γραφή (graphê), meaning "drawing, writing", together meaning "drawing with light". 

Paradigm shift<====>25081<====>Paradigm shift A paradigm shift (also radical theory change),  a concept identified by the American physicist and philosopher Thomas Kuhn (1922–1996), is a fundamental change in the basic concepts and experimental practices of a scientific discipline.  Kuhn contrasted these shifts, which characterize a scientific revolution, to the activity of normal science, which he described as scientific work done within a prevailing framework (or paradigm).  In this context, the word "paradigm" is used in its original Greek meaning, as "example". The nature of scientific revolutions has been studied by modern philosophy since Immanuel Kant used the phrase in the preface to his Critique of Pure Reason (1781). 

Public speaking<====>25084<====>Public speakingPublic speaking (also called oratory or oration) is the process or act of performing a speech to a live audience.  This type of speech is deliberately structured with three general purposes: to inform, to persuade and to entertain.  Public speaking is commonly understood as formal, face-to-face speaking of a single person to a group of listeners.  OverviewThere are five basic elements of public speaking that are described in Lasswell's model of communication: the communicator, message, medium, audience and effect.  In short, the speaker should be answering the question "who says what in which channel to whom with what effect?"Public speaking can serve the purpose of transmitting information, telling a story, motivating people to act or some combination of those. 

Pecorino Romano<====>25087<====>Pecorino Romano  Pecorino Romano ( ) is a hard, salty Italian cheese, often used for grating, made out of sheep's milk (the Italian word pecora, from which the name derives, means sheep).  Pecorino Romano was a staple in the diet for the legionaries of ancient Rome. Today, it is still made according to the original recipe and is one of Italy's oldest cheeses.  Most of its production occurs in Sardinia.  On the first of May, Roman families traditionally eat pecorino with fresh fava beans during a daily excursion in the Roman Campagna.  It is mostly used in Central and Southern Italy. 

Philip II of France<====>25093<====>Philip II of France   Philip II, known as Philip Augustus ( ; 21 August 1165 – 14 July 1223), was King of France from 1180 to 1223, a member of the House of Capet.  Philip's predecessors had been known as kings of the Franks, but from 1190 onward, Philip became the first French monarch to style himself "King of France. " The son of King Louis VII and his third wife, Adèle of Champagne, he was originally nicknamed Dieudonné "God-given" because he was the first son of Louis VII, born late in his father's life.Philip was given the nickname "Augustus" by the chronicler Rigord for having extended the Crown lands of France so remarkably. 

Peripheral nervous system<====>25096<====>Peripheral nervous system The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is one of the two components of the nervous system, the other part is the central nervous system (CNS).  The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord.    The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs, essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body.   Unlike the CNS, the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull, or by the blood–brain barrier, which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries. 

Phase velocity<====>25098<====>Phase velocityThe phase velocity of a wave is the rate at which the phase of the wave propagates in space.  This is the velocity at which the phase of any one frequency component of the wave travels.  For such a component, any given phase of the wave (for example, the crest) will appear to travel at the phase velocity.  The phase velocity is given in terms of the wavelength   (lambda) and period    as v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\lambda}{T}.  Equivalently, in terms of the wave's angular frequency   , which specifies angular change per unit of time, and wavenumber (or angular wave number)   , which represents the proportionality between the angular frequency    and the linear speed (speed of propagation) ν   , v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\omega}{k}. 

Pitot tube<====>25100<====>Pitot tubeA Pitot (   ) tube, also known as Pitot probe, is a pressure measurement instrument used to measure fluid flow velocity.  The pitot tube was invented by the French engineer Henri Pitot in the early 18th century  and was modified to its modern form in the mid-19th century by French scientist Henry Darcy.   It is widely used to determine the airspeed of an aircraft, water speed of a boat, and to measure liquid, air and gas flow velocities in certain industrial applications.  The pitot tube is used to measure the local flow velocity at a given point in the flow stream and not the average flow velocity in the pipe or conduit. 

Pittsburgh<====>25101<====>Pittsburgh   Pittsburgh (   ) is a city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the United States, and is the county seat of Allegheny County.  As of 2017, a total population of 305,704 lives within the city limits, making it the 63rd-largest city in the U. S.The metropolitan population of 2,353,045 is the largest in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania (behind Philadelphia), and the 26th-largest in the U. S. Located at the confluence of the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio rivers, Pittsburgh is known as both "the Steel City" for its more than 300 steel-related businesses, and as the "City of Bridges" for its 446 bridges. 

Psychohistory<====>25102<====>Psychohistory Psychohistory is the study of the psychological motivations of historical events.   It attempts to combine the insights of psychoanalysis with the research methodology of the social sciences to understand the emotional origin of the social and political behavior of groups and nations, past and present.  Its subject matter is childhood and the family, and psychological studies of anthropology and ethnology. DescriptionPsychohistory derives many of its concepts from areas that are perceived to be ignored by conventional historians and anthropologists as shaping factors of human history, in particular, the effects of parenting practice and child abuse.   According to conventional historians "the science of culture is independent of the laws of biology and psychology". 

Patricia Soltysik<====>25103<====>Patricia Soltysik  Patricia Monique Soltysik (May 17, 1950 – May 17, 1974) was an American woman, best known as one of the founders of the Symbionese Liberation Army. Early lifePatricia Soltysik was the daughter of a pharmacist, the third of seven children, the eldest of five girls.  She grew up in Goleta, California, and graduated from Dos Pueblos High School in 1968 in the top 10 percent of her class and was the student body treasurer of her high school.    She enrolled in the University of California, Berkeley on a state scholarship in 1968.   While at Berkeley she became embittered by the "Bloody Thursday" incident where a protester was killed. 

Poliomyelitis<====>25107<====>Poliomyelitis Poliomyelitis, often called polio or infantile paralysis, is an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus.   In about 0. 5 percent of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move.   This can occur over a few hours to a few days.    The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck and diaphragm.   Many but not all people fully recover.   In those with muscle weakness about 2 to 5 percent of children and 15 to 30 percent of adults die. 

Public limited company<====>25109<====>Public limited company A public limited company (legally abbreviated to plc) is a type of public company under the United Kingdom company law, some Commonwealth jurisdictions, and the Republic of Ireland.  It is a limited liability company whose shares may be freely  sold and traded to the public (although a plc may also be privately held, often by another plc), with a minimum share capital of £50,000 and usually with the letters PLC after its name.   Similar companies in the United States are called publicly traded companies.  Public limited companies will also have a separate legal identity.

It is bordered on the south by Sinclair Inlet, on the west by the Bremerton Annex of Naval Base Kitsap, and on the north and east by the city of Bremerton, Washington.  It is the Pacific Northwest's largest naval shore facility and one of Washington state's largest industrial installations. 

Poeciliidae<====>25119<====>Poeciliidae The Poeciliidae are a family of freshwater fishes of the order Cyprinodontiformes, the tooth-carps, and include well-known live-bearing aquarium fish, such as the guppy, molly, platy, and swordtail.  The original distribution of the family was the southeastern United States to north of Río de la Plata, Argentina, and Africa, including Madagascar.  However, due to release of aquarium specimens and the widespread use of species of the genera Poecilia and Gambusia for mosquito control, poeciliids can today be found in all tropical and subtropical areas of the world.  In addition,  Poecilia and Gambusia specimens have been identified in hot springs pools as far north as Banff, Alberta. 

Polar coordinate system<====>25120<====>Polar coordinate system In mathematics, the polar coordinate system is a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a reference point and an angle from a reference direction. The reference point (analogous to the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system) is called the pole, and the ray from the pole in the reference direction is the polar axis.  The distance from the pole is called the radial coordinate or radius, and the angle is called the angular coordinate, polar angle, or azimuth.    History The concepts of angle and radius were already used by ancient peoples of the first millennium BC. 

Polymath<====>25121<====>Polymath    A polymath ( ,  , "having learned much," The term was first recorded in written English in the early seventeenth century    Latin: homo universalis, "universal man" ) is a person whose expertise spans a significant number of different subject areas—such a person is known to draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems. In Western Europe, the first work to use polymathy in its title (De Polymathia tractatio: integri operis de studiis veterum) was published by Johann von Wower, a Hamburg philosopher.   Wower defined polymathy as "knowledge of various matters, drawn from all kinds of studies [. 

PowerBook<====>25122<====>PowerBook The PowerBook (known as Macintosh PowerBook before 1997) is a family of Macintosh laptop computers designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer, Inc.  from 1991 to 2006.  During its lifetime, the PowerBook went through several major revisions and redesigns, often being the first to incorporate features that would later become standard in competing laptops.   The PowerBook line was targeted at the professional market, and received numerous awards, especially in the second half of its life, such as the 2001 Industrial Design Excellence Awards "Gold" status, and Engadget's 2005 "Laptop of the Year".  In 1999, the line was supplemented by the home and education-focused iBook family. 

Phil Ochs<====>25123<====>Phil Ochs  Philip David Ochs ( ; December 19, 1940 – April 9, 1976) was an American protest singer (or, as he preferred, a topical singer) and songwriter who was known for his sharp wit, sardonic humor, earnest humanism, political activism, insightful and alliterative lyrics, and distinctive voice.  He wrote hundreds of songs in the 1960s and 1970s and released eight albums. Ochs performed at many political events during the 1960s counterculture era, including anti-Vietnam War and civil rights rallies, student events, and organized labor events over the course of his career, in addition to many concert appearances at such venues as New York City's Town Hall and Carnegie Hall. 

Prayer wheel<====>25125<====>Prayer wheelA prayer wheel is a cylindrical wheel ( ) on a spindle made from metal, wood, stone, leather or coarse cotton.  Traditionally, the mantra Om Mani Padme Hum is written in Sanskrit on the outside of the wheel.  Also sometimes depicted are Dakinis, Protectors and very often the 8 auspicious symbols Ashtamangala.   At the core of the cylinder is a "Life Tree" often made of wood or metal with certain mantras written on or wrapped around it.   Many thousands (or in the case of larger prayer wheels, millions) of mantras are then wrapped around this life tree. 

Postage stamp<====>25126<====>Postage stamp  A postage stamp is a small piece of paper that is purchased and displayed on an item of mail as evidence of payment of postage.  Typically, stamps are printed on special custom-made paper, show a national designation and a denomination (value) on the front, and have an adhesive gum on the back or are self-adhesive.  Postage stamps are purchased from a postal administration (post office) or other authorized vendor, and are used to pay for the costs involved in moving mail, as well as other business necessities such as insurance and registration.  They are sometimes a source of net profit to the issuing agency, especially when sold to collectors who will not actually use them for postage. 

Ponte Vecchio<====>25130<====>Ponte Vecchio  The Ponte Vecchio ("Old Bridge",  )is a medieval stone closed-spandrel segmental arch bridge over the Arno River, in Florence, Italy, noted for still having shops built along it, as was once common.  Butchers initially occupied the shops; the present tenants are jewelers, art dealers and souvenir sellers.  The Ponte Vecchio's two neighbouring bridges are the Ponte Santa Trinita and the Ponte alle Grazie. History and constructionThe bridge spans the Arno at its narrowest point Touring Club Italiano, Firenze e dintorni 1964:321  where it is believed that a bridge was first built in Roman times,    when the via Cassia crossed the river at this point. 

Porto Ottiolu<====>25133<====>Porto Ottiolu Porto Ottiolu is a private marina and a tourist destination located in the commune of Budoni, Province of Sassari, Sardinia, Italy, on Tyrrhenian Sea, some 35 km south of Olbia. OverviewIt was built in 1988 in the place in where was once the ancient Roman port of Portiolum, and after its immediate success, a huge village was built around it with the same name.  The marina can host 405 boats in 8 classes and has complete services.   It is the largest marina of the East coast of Sardinia.  In its waters, apneist diver Gianluca Genoni repeatedly scored new world records. 

Peenemünde Army Research Center<====>25134<====>Peenemünde Army Research Center  The Peenemünde Army Research Centre ( ,  HVP) was founded in 1937 as one of five military proving grounds under the German Army Weapons Office (Heereswaffenamt).   On April 2, 1936, the aviation ministry paid 750,000 reichsmarks to the town of Wolgastfor the whole Northern peninsula of the Baltic island of Usedom. By the middle of 1938, the Army facility had been separated from the Luftwaffe facility and was nearly complete, with personnel moved from Kummersdorf.    The Army Research Center (Peenemünde Ost)    consisted of Werk Ost and Werk Süd, while Werk West (Peenemünde West) was the Luftwaffe Test Site ( ),    one of the four test and research facilities of the Luftwaffe, with its headquarters facility at Erprobungsstelle Rechlin.

The town is situated on the west bank of the River Camel estuary approximately   northwest of Wadebridge,   northwest of Bodmin and   northeast of Newquay.   The population of Padstow civil parish was 3,162 in the 2001 census,  reducing to 2,993 at the 2011 census.   In addition an electoral ward with the same name exists but extends as far as Trevose Head.  The population for this ward is 4,434 HistoryPadstow was originally named Petroc-stow, Petroc-stowe, or 'Petrock's Place', after the Welsh missionary Saint Petroc, who landed at Trebetherick around AD 500. 

Dakar Rally<====>25136<====>Dakar Rally  The Dakar Rally (or simply "The Dakar"; formerly known as the "Paris–Dakar Rally") is an annual rally raid organised by the Amaury Sport Organisation.  Most events since the inception in 1978 were from Paris, France, to Dakar, Senegal, but due to security threats in Mauritania, which led to the cancellation of the 2008 rally, races since 2009 have been held in South America.  The race is open to amateur and professional entries, amateurs typically making up about eighty percent of the participants. The race is an off-road endurance event.  The terrain that the competitors traverse is much tougher than that used in conventional rallying, and the vehicles used are true off-road vehicles rather than modified on-road vehicles. 

Perception<====>25140<====>Perception    Perception (from the Latin perceptio) is the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information in order to represent and understand the presented information, or the environment.  All perception involves signals that go through the nervous system, which in turn result from physical or chemical stimulation of the sensory system.  Goldstein (2009) pp.  5–7  For example, vision involves light striking the retina of the eye, smell is mediated by odor molecules, and hearing involves pressure waves. Perception is not only the passive receipt of these signals, but it's also shaped by the recipient's learning, memory, expectation, and attention. 

Pitch of brass instruments<====>25141<====>Pitch of brass instruments  The pitch of a brass instrument is determined by its vibratory length, which determines the fundamental frequency of the open instrument and the frequencies of its overtones.   Additional pitches are achieved by varying the length using the instrument's valve, slide, key or crook system.  The fundamental frequency is not playable on some brass instruments.  The table provides the pitch of the second overtone (an octave above the fundamental frequency) and length for some common brass instruments in descending order of pitch.  This pitch is notated transpositionally as middle C for many of these brass instruments. 

Pig<====>25142<====>Pig    A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the even-toed ungulate family Suidae.  Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog.  Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents.  Juvenile pigs are known as piglets.   Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.  With around 1 billion individuals alive at any time, the domestic pig is among the most populous large mammals in the world. 

Packet radio<====>25144<====>Packet radio Packet radio is a form of packet switching technology used to transmit digital data via wireless communications.  Packet radio uses the same concepts of data transmission using datagrams that are fundamental to communications on the Internet, as opposed to older techniques used by dedicated or switched circuits. Purpose and advantagesPacket radio is a digital radio communications mode.  Earlier digital modes were telegraphy (Morse code), teleprinter (Baudot code) and facsimile.  It is possible for any packet station to act as a digipeater, linking distant stations with each other through ad hoc networks.  This makes packet radio especially useful for emergency communications. 

Pizza cheese<====>25146<====>Pizza cheese   Pizza cheese encompasses several varieties and types of cheeses and dairy products that are designed and manufactured for use specifically on pizza.  These include processed and modified cheese such as mozzarella-like processed cheeses and mozzarella variants.  The term can also refer to any type of cheese suitable for use on pizza.   The most popular cheeses used in the preparation of pizza are mozzarella (accounting for about 30%), provolone, cheddar and Parmesan.  Emmental, Romano and ricotta are often used as toppings, and processed pizza cheeses manufactured specifically for pizza are mass-produced.   Some mass-produced pizza cheeses are frozen after manufacturing and shipped frozen. 

Peggy Lee<====>25147<====>Peggy Lee  Norma Deloris Engstrom  (sometimes also spelled Egstrom; May 26, 1920 – January 21, 2002) known professionally as Peggy Lee, was an American jazz and popular music singer, songwriter, composer, and actress, in a career spanning six decades.  From her beginning as a vocalist on local radio to singing with Benny Goodman's big band, she forged a sophisticated persona, evolving into a multi-faceted artist and performer.  During her career, she wrote music for films, acted, and recorded conceptual record albums that combined poetry and music. Early lifeLee was born Norma Deloris Engstrom in Jamestown, North Dakota, the seventh of eight children to parents Marvin Olof Engstrom, a station agent for the Midland Continental Railroad, and his wife, Selma Amelia (née Anderson) Engstrom, on May 26, 1920. 

Pinuccio Sciola<====>25156<====>Pinuccio SciolaPinuccio Sciola (15 March 1942 – 13 May 2016) was an Italian sculptor and muralist from San Sperate, Sardinia.   His work has been mentioned as a major attraction of the nearby town of Assemini.   His work has also been exhibited in Alghero. Forms in which he worked include pietre sonore or "sounding stones": large sculptures (mainly limestones or basalts) that resonate when rubbed by human hands or small rocks.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy<====>25160<====>Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare and usually fatal viral disease characterized by progressive damage (-pathy) or inflammation of the white matter (leuko-) of the brain (-encephalo-) at multiple locations (multifocal).  It is caused by the JC virus, which is normally present and kept under control by the immune system.  JC virus is harmless except in cases of weakened immune systems.  In general, PML has a mortality rate of 30–50 percent in the first few months and those who survive can be left with varying degrees of neurological disabilities. PML occurs almost exclusively in patients with severe immune deficiency, most commonly among patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), but people on chronic immunosuppressive medications including chemotherapy are also at increased risk of PML, such as patients with transplants, Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases. 

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension<====>25161<====>Idiopathic intracranial hypertension  Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure (pressure around the brain) without a detectable cause.   The main symptoms are headache, vision problems, ringing in the ears with the heartbeat, and shoulder pain.    Complications may include vision loss.   Risk factors include being overweight or a recent increase in weight.   Tetracycline may also trigger the condition.   The diagnosis is based on symptoms and a high intracranial pressure founding during a lumbar puncture with no specific cause found on a brain scan.    Treatment includes a healthy diet, salt restriction, and exercise. 

Plymouth Hoe<====>25162<====>Plymouth Hoe  Plymouth Hoe, referred to locally as the Hoe, is a large south facing open public space in the English coastal city of Plymouth.  The Hoe is adjacent to and above the low limestone cliffs that form the seafront and it commands views of Plymouth Sound, Drake's Island, and across the Hamoaze to Mount Edgcumbe in Cornwall.  The name derives from the Anglo-Saxon word Hoe, a sloping ridge shaped like an inverted foot and heel. History  Until the early 17th century large outline images of the giants Gog and Magog (or Goemagot and Corineus) had for a long time been cut into the turf of the Hoe exposing the white limestone beneath. 

Plymouth Sound<====>25163<====>Plymouth SoundPlymouth Sound, or locally just The Sound, is a bay on the English Channel at Plymouth in England. Its southwest and southeast corners are Penlee Point in Cornwall and Wembury Point in Devon, a distance of about 3 nautical miles (6 km).  Its northern limit is Plymouth Hoe giving a north-south distance of nearly 3 nautical miles (6 km). The Sound has three water entrances.  The marine entrance is from the English Channel to the south, with a deep-water channel to the west of the Plymouth Breakwater.  There are two freshwater inlets: one, from the northwest, is from the River Tamar via the Hamoaze and Devonport Dockyard, the largest naval dockyard in western Europe. 

Quentin Tarantino<====>25169<====>Quentin Tarantino  Quentin Jerome Tarantino  ( ; born March 27, 1963) is an American film director, writer, and actor.  His films are characterized by nonlinear storylines, satirical subject matter, an aestheticization of violence, extended scenes of dialogue, ensemble casts consisting of established and lesser-known performers, references to popular culture, soundtracks primarily containing songs and score pieces from the 1960s to the 1980s, and features of neo-noir film.  He is widely considered one of the greatest filmmakers of his generation. His career began in the late 1980s, when he wrote and directed My Best Friend's Birthday, the screenplay of which formed the basis for True Romance. 

Quartile<====>25170<====>QuartileIn descriptive statistics, the quartiles  of a ranked set of data values are the three points that divide the data set into four equal groups, each group comprising a quarter of the data.  A quartile is a type of quantile.  The first quartile (Q 1 ) is defined as the middle number between the smallest number and the median of the data set.  The second quartile (Q 2 ) is the median of the data.  The third quartile (Q 3 ) is the middle value between the median and the highest value of the data set. 

Quadratic equation<====>25175<====>Quadratic equation In algebra, a quadratic equation (from the Latin quadratus for "square") is any equation having the form  ax^2+bx+c=0 where   represents an unknown, and  ,  , and   represent known numbers such that   is not equal to  .  If  , then the equation is linear, not quadratic.   The numbers  ,  , and   are the coefficients of the equation, and may be distinguished by calling them, respectively, the quadratic coefficient, the linear coefficient and the constant or free term.  Because the quadratic equation involves only one unknown, it is called "univariate". 

Quark<====>25179<====>Quark   A quark ( ) is a type of elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter.  Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei.Due to a phenomenon known as color confinement, quarks are never directly observed or found in isolation; they can be found only within hadrons, such as baryons (of which protons and neutrons are examples) and mesons.   For this reason, much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of the hadrons themselves. 

Quantization (physics)<====>25182<====>Quantization (physics)   In physics, quantization is the process of transition from a classical understanding of physical phenomena to a newer understanding known as quantum mechanics.   It is a procedure for constructing a quantum field theory starting from a classical field theory.  This is a generalization of the procedure for building quantum mechanics from classical mechanics.  One also speaks of field quantization, as in the "quantization of the electromagnetic field", where one refers to photons as field "quanta" (for instance as light quanta).  This procedure is basic to theories of particle physics, nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum optics. 

Quantile<====>25184<====>QuantileIn statistics and the theory of probability, quantiles are cutpoints dividing the range of a probability distribution into contiguous intervals with equal probabilities, or dividing the observations in a sample in the same way.  There is one less quantile than the number of groups created.  Thus quartiles are the three cut points that will divide a dataset into four equal-size groups.  Common quantiles have special names: for instance quartile, decile (creating 10 groups: see below for more).   The groups created are termed halves, thirds, quarters, etc. , though sometimes the terms for the quantile are used for the groups created, rather than for the cut points. 

Q<====>25185<====>Q    Q (named cue   ) is the 17th letter of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet.  In nearly all languages using the Latin script it is a consonant, not a vowel. HistoryEgyptian hieroglyph   wj Phoenician   qoph Etruscan  Q Greek   Qoppa  V24The Semitic sound value of Qôp was   (voiceless uvular stop), and the form of the letter could have been based on the eye of a needle, a knot, or even a monkey with its tail hanging down. 

History of Qatar<====>25187<====>History of Qatar   The history of Qatar spans from its first duration of human occupation to its formation as a modern state.  Human occupation of Qatar dates back to 50,000 years ago, and Stone Age encampments and tools have been unearthed in the peninsula.   Mesopotamia was the first civilization to have a presence in the area during the Neolithic period, evidenced by the discovery of potsherds originating from the Ubaid period near coastal encampments.  The peninsula fell under the domain of several different empires during its early years of settlement, including the Seleucid, the Parthians and the Sasanians. 

Geography of Qatar<====>25188<====>Geography of Qatar Qatar is a peninsula in the east of Arabia, bordering the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia, in a strategic location near major petroleum deposits.  Qatar occupies   on a peninsula that extends approximately to   north into the Persian Gulf from the Arabian Peninsula. Varying in width between  , the land is mainly flat (the highest point is  ) and rocky.  Notable features include coastal salt pans, elevated limestone formations (the Dukhan anticline) along the west coast under which lies the Dukhan oil field, and massive sand dunes surrounding Khawr al Udayd, an inlet of the Persian Gulf in the southeast known to local English speakers as the Inland Sea. 

Demographics of Qatar<====>25189<====>Demographics of Qatar Natives of the Arabian Peninsula, many Qataris are descended from a number of migratory tribes that came to Qatar in the 18th century to escape the harsh conditions of the neighboring areas of Nejd and Al-Hasa.  Some are descended from Omani tribes.  Qatar has about 2. 6 million inhabitants as of early 2017, the majority of whom (about 92%) live in Doha, the capital.Foreign workers amount to around 88% of the population, with Indians being the largest community numbering around 650,000.  As of an unofficial 2017 report, there were a further 350,000 Nepalis, 280,000 Bangladeshis, 260,000 Filipinos, 200,000 Egyptians, 145,000 Sri Lankans and 125,000 Pakistanis among many other nationalities. 

Politics of Qatar<====>25190<====>Politics of Qatar The political system of Qatar is either an absolute monarchy or a constitutional monarchy, with the Emir of Qatar as head of state and head of government.  Under the 2003 constitutional referendum it should be a constitutional monarchy.   Sharia Law is the main source of Qatari legislation according to Qatar's Constitution.  Legal systemSharia law is the main source of Qatari legislation according to Qatar's Constitution.    Sharia law is applied to laws pertaining to family law, inheritance, and several criminal acts (including adultery, robbery and murder). 

Economy of Qatar<====>25191<====>Economy of Qatar    Qatar's economy is one of the richest economies in the world based on GDP per capita, ranking between fifth and seventh on world rankings for 2015 and 2016 data compiled by the World Bank, United Nations, and IMF.Petroleum and natural gas are the cornerstones of Qatar's economy and account for more than 70% of total government revenue, more than 60% of gross domestic product, and roughly 85% of export earnings.  Qatar has the world's third largest proven natural gas reserve and is the second-largest exporter of natural gas.

Transport in Qatar<====>25193<====>Transport in QatarThis article is about transport in Qatar. Public transportIn 2002, the Qatari government launched Mowasalat, a company 100% owned by the government, managed and operated by the state authorities to ensure the smooth provision of "integrated ground transport services" for the entire country with a growing population of more than 1,400,000 people.  Previously, 3,000 privately owned orange taxis used to rule the streets of Qatar but the government took them off the roads as they saw them as a threat to the new Mowasalat taxis.  There has been much controversy over this move, as it is now very hard to find a taxi in Doha. 

Qatar Armed Forces<====>25194<====>Qatar Armed Forces  The Qatar Armed Forces are the military forces of Qatar.  The country maintains a military force of approximately 104,100 men, including an army (65,000), navy (21,400), Emiri Guard (20,400), ISF (15,000) and air force (3,700).  Furthermore, since 2015, Qatar implemented mandatory military conscription with an average of 2000 graduates per year.   As of 2010, Qatar's defence expenditures added up to a total of $1. 913 billion, about 1. 5% of the national GDP, according to the SIPRI.   Qatar has recently signed defence pacts with the United States in 2002  and 2013  and with the United Kingdom, as well as with France earlier, in 1994. 

Foreign relations of Qatar<====>25195<====>Foreign relations of Qatar  Qatar achieved full independence from the United Kingdom on 3 September 1971.   Arab states were among the first to recognize Qatar, and the country gained admittance to the United Nations and the Arab League in the same year.  Qatar established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, and Communist China in 1988.  The country was an early member of OPEC and a founding member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Over the past two decades, Qatar has grown its international profile and punched above its weight in international affairs.  It has been "very confident of itself and believes that it has the capabilities and capacity to adopt an independent foreign policy. 

Quaternary<====>25198<====>Quaternary  Quaternary ( ) is the current and most recent of the three periods of the Cenozoic Era in the geologic time scale of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS).It follows the Neogene Period and spans from 2. 588 ± 0. 005 million years ago to the present.   The Quaternary Period is divided into two epochs: the Pleistocene (2. 588 million years ago to 11. 7 thousand years ago) and the Holocene (11. 7 thousand years ago to today).   The informal term "Late Quaternary" refers to the past 0. 5–1. 0 million years. 

Quotation<====>25199<====>Quotation A quotation is the repetition of one  expression as part of another one, particularly when the quoted expression is well-known or explicitly attributed by citation to its original source, and it is indicated by (punctuated with) quotation marks. A quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a painting, scenes from a movie or sections from a musical composition. Reasons for using quotationsQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or author, to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law. 

Quantum mechanics<====>25202<====>Quantum mechanics   Quantum mechanics (QM; also known as quantum physics or quantum theory), including quantum field theory, is a fundamental theory in physics which describes nature at the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles.    Classical physics (the physics existing before quantum mechanics) is a set of fundamental theories which describes nature at ordinary  (macroscopic) scale.   Most theories in classical physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid at large (macroscopic) scale.   Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that: energy, momentum and other quantities of a system may be restricted to discrete values (quantization), objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave-particle duality), and there are limits to the precision with which quantities can be known (uncertainty principle). 

Quilting<====>25203<====>Quilting Quilting is the process of sewing two or more layers of fabric together to make a thicker padded material, usually to create a quilt or quilted garment.  Typically, quilting is done with three layers: the top fabric or quilt top, batting or insulating material and backing material, but many different styles are adopted. The process of quilting uses a needle and thread to join two or more layers of material to make a quilt.  The quilter's hand or sewing machine passes the needle and thread through all layers and then brings the needle back up.  The process is repeated across the entire area where quilting is wanted. 

Qt (software)<====>25204<====>Qt (software)   Qt (  "cute"   ) is a cross-platform application framework that is used for developing application software that can be run on various software and hardware platforms with little or no change in the underlying codebase, while still being a native application with native capabilities and speed.  Qt is currently being developed both by The Qt Company, a publicly listed company, and the Qt Project under open-source governance, involving individual developers and firms working to advance Qt.Qt is available with both proprietary  and open source  GPL 2. 

QuakeC<====>25207<====>QuakeC QuakeC is an interpreted language developed in 1996 by John Carmack of id Software to program parts of the video game Quake.  Using QuakeC, a programmer is able to customize Quake to great extents by adding weapons, changing game logic and physics, and programming complex scenarios.  It can be used to control many aspects of the game itself, such as parts of the AI, triggers, or changes in the level.  The Quake engine was the only game engine to use QuakeC.  Following engines used DLL game modules for customization written in C and C++ from id Tech 4 on. 

Quad Cities<====>25208<====>Quad Cities   The Quad Citiesis a region of five cities in northwest Illinois and Southeastern Iowa.   The urban core consists of five principal cities: Davenport and Bettendorf in Iowa, and Rock Island, Moline, and East Moline in Illinois.  These cities are the center of the Quad Cities Metropolitan Area, which as of 2013 had a population estimate of 383,781 and a CSA (Combined Statistical Area) population of 474,937, making it the 90th largest CSA in the nation.   HistoryEarly historyBefore European settlers came to inhabit the Quad Cities, the confluence of rivers had attracted many varying cultures of indigenous peoples, who used the waterways and riverbanks for their settlements for thousands of years. 

Quantum chemistry<====>25211<====>Quantum chemistry Quantum chemistry is a branch of chemistry whose primary focus is the application of quantum mechanics in physical models and experiments of chemical systems.  It is also called molecular quantum mechanics. OverviewIt involves heavy interplay of experimental and theoretical methods. Experimental quantum chemists rely heavily on spectroscopy, through which information regarding the quantization of energy on a molecular scale can be obtained.   Common methods are infra-red (IR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and scanning probe microscopy. Theoretical quantum chemistry, the workings of which also tend to fall under the category of computational chemistry, seeks to calculate the predictions of quantum theory as atoms and molecules can only have discrete energies; as this task, when applied to polyatomic species, invokes the many-body problem, these calculations are performed using computers rather than by analytical "back of the envelope" methods, pen recorder or computerized data station with a VDU. 

QWERTY<====>25213<====>QWERTY  QWERTY is a keyboard design for Latin-script alphabets.  The name comes from the order of the first six keys on the top left letter row of the keyboard ( ).  The QWERTY design is based on a layout created for the Sholes and Glidden typewriter and sold to Remington in 1873.  It became popular with the success of the Remington No.  2 of 1878, and remains in widespread use. History The QWERTY layout was devised and created in the early 1870s by Christopher Latham Sholes, a newspaper editor and printer who lived in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 

Quake III Arena<====>25215<====>Quake III Arena Quake III Arena is a multiplayer-focused first-person shooter video game released in December 1999.  The game was developed by id Software and featured music composed by Sonic Mayhem and Front Line Assembly founder, Bill Leeb.  Quake III Arena is the third game in the Quake series and differs from previous games by excluding a traditional single-player element, instead focusing on multiplayer action.  The single-player mode is played against computer-controlled bots. Notable features of Quake III Arena include the minimalist design, lacking rarely used items and features, the extensive customizability of player settings such as field of view, texture detail and enemy model, and advanced movement features such as strafe-jumping and rocket-jumping. 

Quake II<====>25216<====>Quake II   Quake II is a first-person shooter video game released in December 1997.  It was developed by id Software and published by Activision.  It is not a direct sequel to Quake; id decided to revert to an existing trademark when they were unable to agree on a new name that did not violate another company's trademark.  The soundtrack for Quake II was mainly provided by Sonic Mayhem, with some additional tracks by Bill Brown; the main theme was also composed by Bill Brown and Rob Zombie, and one track by Jer Sypult. The soundtrack for the Nintendo 64 version of the game was composed by Aubrey Hodges, credited as Ken "Razor" Richmond. 

Qi<====>25217<====>Qi In traditional Chinese culture, qi or ch'i ( ) is believed to be a vital force forming part of any living thing.    Qi translates literally as "breath", "air", or "gas", and figuratively as "material energy", "life force", or "energy flow". Qi is the central underlying principle in Chinese traditional medicine and in Chinese martial arts.  The practice of cultivating and balancing qi is called qigong. There is widespread  belief in the reality of qi.  It is a non-scientific, unverified concept. 

Quantum computing<====>25220<====>Quantum computing  Quantum computing  is computing using quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement.   A quantum computer is a device that performs quantum computing.  They are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors.  Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states.  A quantum Turing machine is a theoretical model of such a computer, and is also known as the universal quantum computer. 

Quasigroup<====>25223<====>QuasigroupIn mathematics, especially in abstract algebra, a quasigroup is an algebraic structure resembling a group in the sense that "division" is always possible.  Quasigroups differ from groups mainly in that they need not be associative. A quasigroup with an identity element is called a loop.  DefinitionsThere are at least two structurally equivalent formal definitions of quasigroup.  One defines a quasigroup as a set with one binary operation, and the other, from universal algebra, defines a quasigroup as having three primitive operations.  The homomorphic image of a quasigroup defined with a single binary operation, however, need not be a quasigroup. 

Quaestor<====>25225<====>Quaestor  A   ( ,  ,  )  was a public official in Ancient Rome.  The position served different functions depending on the period.  In the Roman Kingdom,   (quaestors with judicial powers) were appointed by the king to investigate and handle murders.  In the Roman Republic, quaestors (also pluralized  ) were elected officials that supervised the state treasury and conducted audits.  It was the lowest ranking position in the   (course of offices).  However, this means that in the political environment of Rome, it was quite common for many aspiring politicians to take the position of quaestor as an early rung on the political ladder. 

Q.E.D.<====>25228<====>Q. E. D.  Q. E. D.  (also written QED and QED) is an initialism of the Latin phrase   meaning "what was to be demonstrated" or "what was to be shown. "   Some may also use a less direct translation instead: "thus it has been demonstrated. " Traditionally, the phrase is placed in its abbreviated form at the end of a mathematical proof or philosophical argument when the original proposition has been restated exactly, as the conclusion of the demonstration or completion of the proof.  Euclid's Elements translated from Greek by Thomas L.  Heath. 

Quagga<====>25229<====>Quagga   The quagga (  or  ) (Equus quagga quagga) is an extinct subspecies of plains zebra that lived in South Africa until the 19th century.  It was long thought to be a distinct species, but genetic studies have shown it to be the southernmost subspecies of plains zebra.  It is considered particularly close to Burchell's zebra.  Its name was derived from its call, which sounded like "kwa-ha-ha". The quagga is believed to have been around   long and   tall at the shoulder.  It was distinguished from other zebras by its limited pattern of primarily brown and white stripes, mainly on the front part of the body. 

QuickTime<====>25231<====>QuickTime    QuickTime is an extensible multimedia framework developed by Apple Inc. , capable of handling various formats of digital video, picture, sound, panoramic images, and interactivity.  First made in 1991, the latest Mac version, QuickTime X, is currently available on Mac OS X Snow Leopard and newer.  Apple ceased support for the Windows version of QuickTime in 2016.    As of Mac OS X Lion, the underlying media framework for QuickTime, QTKit, is deprecated in favor of a newer graphics framework, AV Foundation.   In iOS, the video player on the Internet was QuickTime-based, used to play videos on the internet. 

Quartz<====>25233<====>Quartz    Quartz is a mineral composed of silicon and oxygen atoms in a continuous framework of SiO 4  silicon–oxygen tetrahedra, with each oxygen being shared between two tetrahedra, giving an overall chemical formula of SiO 2 .   Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in Earth's continental crust, behind feldspar.  Quartz crystals are chiral, and exist in two forms, the normal α-quartz and the high-temperature β-quartz.  The transformation from α-quartz to beta-quartz takes place abruptly at 573 °C (846 K).  Since the transformation is accompanied by a significant change in volume, it can easily induce fracturing of ceramics or rocks passing through this temperature limit. 

Quadrivium<====>25234<====>QuadriviumThe quadrivium (plural: quadrivia   ) is the four subjects, or arts, taught after teaching the trivium.  The word is Latin, meaning four ways, and its use for the four subjects has been attributed to Boethius or Cassiodorus in the 6th century.   "Quadrivium (education)".  Britannica Online.  2011.  EB.   Together, the trivium and the quadrivium comprised the seven liberal arts (based on thinking skills),    as distinguished from the practical arts (such as medicine and architecture). The quadrivium consisted of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy.  These followed the preparatory work of the trivium, consisting of grammar, logic, and rhetoric. 

Quadrupedalism<====>25236<====>QuadrupedalismQuadrupedalism or pronograde posture is a form of terrestrial locomotion in animals using four limbs or legs.  An animal or machine that usually moves in a quadrupedal manner is known as a quadruped, meaning "four feet" (from the Latin quattuor for "four" and pes for "foot").  The majority of quadrupeds are vertebrate animals, including mammals such as cattle, dogs and cats, and reptiles such as lizards. Few other animals are quadrupedal, though a few birds like the shoebill sometimes use their wings to right themselves after lunging at prey.  Quadrupeds vs.  tetrapods Although the words quadruped and tetrapod are both derived from terms meaning "four-footed", they have distinct meanings. 

Quarantine<====>25237<====>Quarantine   A quarantine is used to separate and restrict the movement of people; it is a 'state of enforced isolation'.   This is often used in connection to disease and illness, such as those who may possibly have been exposed to a communicable disease.   The term is often erroneously used to mean medical isolation, which is "to separate ill persons who have a communicable disease from those who are healthy".   The word comes from an Italian variant (seventeenth-century Venetian) of 'quaranta giorni', meaning forty days, the period that all ships were required to be isolated before passengers and crew could go ashore during the Black Death plague epidemic. 

Quasar<====>25239<====>Quasar  A quasar ( ) (also quasi-stellar object or QSO) is an active galactic nucleus of very high luminosity.  A quasar consists of a supermassive black hole surrounded by an orbiting accretion disk of gas.  As gas in the accretion disk falls toward the black hole, energy is released in the form of electromagnetic radiation.  Quasars emit energy across the electromagnetic spectrum and can be observed at radio, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, and X-ray wavelengths.   The most powerful quasars have luminosities exceeding 10 41  W, thousands of times greater than the luminosity of a large galaxy such as the Milky Way. 

Quinquagesima<====>25240<====>Quinquagesima  Quinquagesima is one of the names used in the Western Church for the Sunday before Ash Wednesday.   It is also called Quinquagesima Sunday, Quinquagesimae, Estomihi, Shrove Sunday, or the Sunday next before Lent. EtymologyThe name Quinquagesima originates from Latin quinquagesimus (fiftieth).  This is in reference to the fifty days before Easter Day using inclusive counting which counts both Sundays (normal counting would count only one of these).  Since the forty days of the Lent do not include Sundays, the first day of Lent, Ash Wednesday, succeeds Quinquagesima Sunday by only three days.  The name Estomihi is derived from the incipit or opening words of the Introit for the Sunday, Esto mihi in Deum protectorem, et in locum refugii, ut salvum me facias, ("Be Thou unto me a God, a Protector, and a place of refuge, to save me")  . 

Quassia<====>25241<====>Quassia  Quassia (  or  ) is a flora genus in the family Simaroubaceae.  Its size is disputed; some botanists treat it as consisting of only one species, Quassia amara from tropical South America, while others treat it in a wide circumscription as a pantropical genus containing up to 40 species of trees and shrubs.  The genus was named after a former slave from Surinam, Graman Quassi in the eighteenth century.  He discovered the medicinal properties of the bark of Quassia amara. Broader treatments of the genus include the following and other species:Quassia africanaQuassia amaraQuassia arnhemensis - AustraliaQuassia bidwilliiQuassia indicaQuassia sp. 

Quisling<====>25243<====>Quisling Quisling ( ;  ) is a term originating from Norway, which is used in Scandinavian languages and in English for a person who collaborates with an enemy occupying force – or more generally as a synonym for traitor.The word originates from the surname of the Norwegian war-time leader Vidkun Quisling, who headed a domestic Nazi collaborationist regime during World War II. OriginUse of Quisling's surname as a term predates World War II.  The first recorded use of the term was by Norwegian Labour Party politician Oscar Torp in a 2 January 1933 newspaper interview, where he used it as a general term for followers of Vidkun Quisling. 

Quill<====>25247<====>Quill  A quill pen is a writing implement made from a moulted flight feather (preferably a primary wing-feather) of a large bird.  Quills were used for writing with ink before the invention of the dip pen, the metal-nibbed pen, the fountain pen, and, eventually, the ballpoint pen.  The hand-cut goose quill is rarely used as a calligraphy tool, because many papers are now derived from wood pulp and wear down the quill very quickly.  However, it is still the tool of choice for a few scribes who noted that quills provide an unmatched sharp stroke as well as greater flexibility than a steel pen. 

Quo vadis?<====>25248<====>Quo vadis?  Quo vadis?  ( ,  ) is a Latin phrase meaning "Where are you going?"It also may refer to a Christian tradition regarding Saint Peter.  According to the apocryphal Acts of Peter (Vercelli Acts XXXV ), Peter flees from crucifixion in Rome at the hands of the government, and along the road outside the city, he meets the risen Jesus.  In the Latin translation, Peter asks Jesus, "Quo vadis?" He replies, "Romam eo iterum crucifigi ("I am going to Rome to be crucified again").  Peter then gains the courage to continue his ministry and returns to the city, where he is martyred by being crucified upside-down. 

Qantas<====>25254<====>Qantas  Qantas Airways (   ;  ) is the flag carrier of Australia and its largest airline by fleet size, international flights and international destinations.   It is the third oldest airline in the world, after KLM and Avianca    having been founded in November 1920; it began international passenger flights in May 1935.  The Qantas name comes from "QANTAS", an acronym for its original name, "Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services", and it is nicknamed "The Flying Kangaroo".  Qantas is a founding member of the Oneworld airline alliance. 

QED (text editor)<====>25256<====>QED (text editor)QED is a line-oriented computer text editor that was developed by Butler Lampson and L.  Peter Deutsch for the Berkeley Timesharing System running on the SDS 940.  It was implemented by L.  Peter Deutsch and Dana Angluin between 1965 and 1966.   QED (for "quick editor" ) addressed teleprinter usage, but systems "for CRT displays [were] not considered, since many of their design considerations [were] quite different. " Ken Thompson later wrote a version for CTSS; this version was notable for introducing regular expressions.  Thompson rewrote QED in BCPL for Multics.   The Multics version was ported to the GE-600 system used at Bell Labs in the late 1960s under GECOS and later GCOS after Honeywell took over GE's computer business. 

Qusay Hussein<====>25257<====>Qusay Hussein   Qusay Saddam Hussein al-Tikriti (or Qusai,  ;   –  ) was the second son of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.   He was appointed as his father's heir apparent in 2000. Early lifeQusay was born in Baghdad in 1966 to Ba'athist revolutionary Saddam Hussein, who was in prison at the time, and his wife and cousin, Sajida Talfah.  Unlike other members of his family and the government, little information is known about Qusay, politically or personally.  He married Sahar Maher Abd al-Rashid; the daughter of Maher Abd al-Rashid, a top ranking military official, and had three sons: Mustapha Qusay (born 3 January 1989 – 22 July 2003); Yahya Qusay (born 1991) and Yaqub Qusay(chor). 

Quatrain<====>25263<====>Quatrain A quatrain is a type of stanza, or a complete poem, consisting of four lines. Existing in a variety of forms, the quatrain appears in poems from the poetic traditions of various ancient civilizations including Ancient India, Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, and China, and continues into the 21st century, where it is seen in works published in many languages.  During Europe's Dark Ages, in the Middle East and especially Iran, polymath poets such as Omar Khayyam continued to popularize this form of poetry, also known as Ruba'i, well beyond their borders and time.    Michel de Nostredame (Nostradamus) used the quatrain form to deliver his famous prophecies in the 16th century. 

Quantum chromodynamics<====>25264<====>Quantum chromodynamics   In theoretical physics, quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons, the fundamental particles that make up composite hadrons such as the proton, neutron and pion.   QCD is a type of quantum field theory called a non-abelian gauge theory, with symmetry group SU(3).  The QCD analog of electric charge is a property called color.  Gluons are the force carrier of the theory, like photons are for the electromagnetic force in quantum electrodynamics.  The theory is an important part of the Standard Model of particle physics. 

Queue (abstract data type)<====>25265<====>Queue (abstract data type)  In computer science, a queue (   ) is a particular kind of abstract data type or collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principle (or only) operations on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position, known as enqueue, and removal of entities from the front terminal position, known as dequeue.  This makes the queue a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.  In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. 

Quake (video game)<====>25266<====>Quake (video game)    Quake is a first-person shooter video game, developed by id Software and published by GT Interactive in 1996.  It is the first game in the Quake series.   In the game, players must find their way through various maze-like, medieval environments while battling a variety of monsters using a wide array of weapons. The successor to id Software's Doom series, Quake built upon the technology and gameplay of its predecessor.  Unlike the Doom engine before it, the Quake engine offered full real-time 3D rendering and had early support for 3D acceleration through OpenGL. 

Quantum field theory<====>25267<====>Quantum field theory   In theoretical physics, quantum field theory (QFT) is the theoretical framework for constructing quantum mechanical models of subatomic particles in particle physics and quasiparticles in condensed matter physics.  It is a set of notions and mathematical tools that combines classical fields, special relativity, and quantum mechanics,  and, when combined with the cluster decomposition principle,  it may be the only way to do so,  while retaining the ideas of quantum point particles and locality.  QFT was historically widely believed to be truly fundamental.  It is now believed, primarily due to the continued failures of quantization of general relativity, to be only a very good low-energy approximation, i. 

Quantum electrodynamics<====>25268<====>Quantum electrodynamics In particle physics, quantum electrodynamics (QED) is the relativistic quantum field theory of electrodynamics.  In essence, it describes how light and matter interact and is the first theory where full agreement between quantum mechanics and special relativity is achieved.  QED mathematically describes all phenomena involving electrically charged particles interacting by means of exchange of photons and represents the quantum counterpart of classical electromagnetism giving a complete account of matter and light interaction. In technical terms, QED can be described as a perturbation theory of the electromagnetic quantum vacuum.   Richard Feynman called it "the jewel of physics" for its extremely accurate predictions of quantities like the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and the Lamb shift of the energy levels of hydrogen. 

Quine (computing)<====>25270<====>Quine (computing)A quine is a non-empty computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output.  The standard terms for these programs in the computability theory and computer science literature are "self-replicating programs", "self-reproducing programs", and "self-copying programs". A quine is a fixed point of an execution environment, when the execution environment is viewed as a function transforming programs into their outputs.  Quines are possible in any Turing complete programming language, as a direct consequence of Kleene's recursion theorem.  For amusement, programmers sometimes attempt to develop the shortest possible quine in any given programming language. 

Field of fractions<====>25271<====>Field of fractions In abstract algebra, the field of fractions of an integral domain is the smallest field in which it can be embedded.   The elements of the field of fractions of the integral domain   R   are equivalence classes (see the construction below) written as  \frac{a}{b}   with   a   and   b   in   R   and   b\neq0 .  The field of fractions of   R   is sometimes denoted by   \mathrm{Quot}(R)   or   \mathrm{Frac}(R) . 

Quadratic reciprocity<====>25272<====>Quadratic reciprocity In number theory, the law of quadratic reciprocity is a theorem about modular arithmetic that gives conditions for the solvability of quadratic equations modulo prime numbers.  There are a number of equivalent statements of the theorem.  One version of the law states that  This law, combined with the properties of the Legendre symbol, means that any Legendre symbol can be calculated.  This makes it possible to determine, for any quadratic equation,  x^2\equiv a \pmod{p},  where p is an odd prime, whether it has a solution.  However, it does not provide any help at all for actually finding the solution. 

Quantum information<====>25274<====>Quantum informationIn physics and computer science, quantum information is information that is held in the state of a quantum system.  Quantum information is the basic entity of study in quantum information theory, and can be manipulated using engineering techniques known as quantum information processing.   Much like classical information can be processed with digital computers, transmitted from place to place, manipulated with algorithms, and analyzed with the mathematics of computer science, so also analogous concepts apply to quantum information. Quantum informationQuantum information differs strongly from classical information, epitomized by the bit, in many striking and unfamiliar ways.   Among these are the following:A unit of quantum information is the qubit.

Quarterback<====>25277<====>Quarterback A quarterback (commonly abbreviated "QB") is a position in American and Canadian football.  Quarterbacks are members of the offensive team and line up directly behind the offensive line.  In modern American football, the quarterback is usually considered the leader of the offensive team, and is often responsible for calling the play in the huddle. OverviewIn modern American football, the quarterback is usually the leader of the offense.  The quarterback touches the ball on almost every offensive play, and his successes and failures can have a significant impact on the fortunes of his team.  Accordingly, the quarterback is among the most glorified and scrutinized positions in team sports. 

Quadrilateral<====>25278<====>Quadrilateral  In Euclidean plane geometry, a quadrilateral is a polygon with four edges (or sides) and four vertices or corners.  Sometimes, the term quadrangle is used, by analogy with triangle, and sometimes tetragon for consistency with pentagon (5-sided), hexagon (6-sided) and so on. The origin of the word "quadrilateral" is the two Latin words quadri, a variant of four, and latus, meaning "side". Quadrilaterals are simple (not self-intersecting) or complex (self-intersecting), also called crossed.  Simple quadrilaterals are either convex or concave. The interior angles of a simple (and planar) quadrilateral ABCD add up to 360 degrees of arc, that is \angle A+\angle B+\angle C+\angle D=360^{\circ}. 

Quantum teleportation<====>25280<====>Quantum teleportation Quantum Teleportation is a process by which quantum information (e. g.  the exact state of an atom or photon) can be transmitted (exactly, in principle)  from one location to another, with the help of classical communication and previously shared quantum entanglement between the sending and receiving location.  Because it depends on classical communication, which can proceed no faster than the speed of light, it cannot be used for faster-than-light transport or communication of classical bits.  While it has proven possible to teleport one or more qubits of information between two (entangled) atoms,    this has not yet been achieved between molecules or anything larger. 

Qubit<====>25284<====>Qubit   In quantum computing, a qubit ( ) or quantum bit (sometimes qbit) is a unit of quantum information—the quantum analogue of the classical binary bit.   A qubit is a two-state quantum-mechanical system, such as the polarization of a single photon: here the two states are vertical polarization and horizontal polarization.   In a classical system, a bit would have to be in one state or the other.  However, quantum mechanics allows the qubit to be in a superposition of both states at the same time, a property that is fundamental to quantum computing. Origin of the nameThe coining of the term “qubit” is attributed to Benjamin Schumacher. 

Quechuan languages<====>25286<====>Quechuan languages Quechua  , known as Runasimi ("people's language") in the Quechuan language, is an indigenous language family, with variations spoken by the Quechua peoples, primarily living in the Andes and highlands of South America.   Derived from a common ancestral language, it is the most widely spoken language family of indigenous peoples of the Americas, with a total of probably some 8–10 million speakers.  Adelaar 2004, pp.  167–168, 255.   Approximately 25% (7. 7 million) of Peruvians speak some variation of Quechua.   It is perhaps most widely known for being the main language of the Inca Empire. 

Protein quaternary structure<====>25291<====>Protein quaternary structure  Protein quaternary structure  is the number and arrangement of multiple folded protein subunits in a multi-subunit complex.  It includes organisations from simple dimers to large homooligomers and complexes with defined or variable numbers of subunits.   It can also refer to biomolecular complexes of proteins with nucleic acids and other cofactors. Description and examples Many proteins are actually assemblies of multiple polypeptide chains.  The quaternary structure refers to the number and arrangement of the protein subunits with respect to one another.   Examples of proteins with quaternary structure include hemoglobin, DNA polymerase, and ion channels. 

Quest for Glory<====>25292<====>Quest for Glory   Quest for Glory is a series of hybrid adventure/role-playing video games, which were designed by Corey and Lori Ann Cole.The series was created in the Sierra Creative Interpreter, a toolset developed at Sierra specifically to assist with adventure game development.   The series combines humor, puzzle elements, themes and characters borrowed from various legends, puns, and memorable characters, creating a 5-part series in the Sierra stable. The series was originally titled Hero's Quest.  However, Sierra failed to trademark the name. 

Quango<====>25293<====>Quango  A quango or QUANGO (less often QuANGO or QANGO) is a quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation.  The concept is most often applied in the United Kingdom and, to a lesser degree, Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United States, and other English-speaking countries.  As its name suggests, a quango is a hybrid form of organization, with elements of both non-government organizations (NGOs) and public sector bodies.  It is typically an organisation to which a government has devolved power, but which is still partly controlled and/or financed by government bodies. In the UK, the term quango covers different "arm's-length" government bodies, including "non-departmental public bodies", non-ministerial departments, and executive agencies. 

Quiver<====>25295<====>Quiver  A quiver is a container for holding arrows, bolts, or darts.  It can be carried on an archer's body, the bow, or the ground, depending on the type of shooting and the archer's personal preference.  Quivers were traditionally made of leather, wood, furs, and other natural materials, but are now often made of metal or plastic. Types Belt quiverThe most common style of quiver is a flat or cylindrical container suspended from the belt.   They are found across many cultures from North America to China.   Many variations of this type exist, such as being canted forwards or backwards, and being carried on the dominant hand side, off-hand side, or the small of the back. 

Quinine<====>25297<====>Quinine   Quinine is a medication used to treat malaria and babesiosis.This includes the treatment of malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum that is resistant to chloroquine when artesunate is not available.    While used for restless legs syndrome, it is not recommended for this purpose due to the risk of side effects.   It can be taken by mouth or used intravenously.   Malaria resistant to quinine occurs in certain areas of the world.   Quinine is also the ingredient in tonic water that gives it its bitter taste.

Quail<====>25302<====>Quail  Quail is a collective name for several genera of mid-sized birds generally placed in the order Galliformes.   Old World quail are placed in the family Phasianidae, and New World quail are placed in the family Odontophoridae.  The species of buttonquail are named for their superficial resemblance to quail, and form the family  Turnicidae in the order Charadriiformes.  The king quail, an Old World quail, often is sold in the pet trade, and within this trade is commonly, though mistakenly, referred to as a "button quail".  Many of the common larger species are farm-raised for table food or egg consumption, and are hunted on game farms or in the wild, where they may be released to supplement the wild population, or extend into areas outside their natural range. 

Crossbow bolt<====>25305<====>Crossbow bolt A quarrel or bolt is the arrow used in a crossbow.   The name "quarrel" is derived from the French carré, meaning square, referring to their typically square heads. Although their lengths vary, they are typically shorter than traditional arrows.Footnotes References

Quasispecies model<====>25308<====>Quasispecies model The quasispecies model is a description of the process of the Darwinian evolution of certain self-replicating entities within the framework of physical chemistry.   Put simply, a quasispecies is a large group or "cloud" of related genotypes that exist in an environment of high mutation rate, where a large fraction of offspring are expected to contain one or more mutations relative to the parent.   This is in contrast to a species, which from an evolutionary perspective is a more-or-less stable single genotype, most of the offspring of which will be genetically accurate copies.  It is useful mainly in providing a qualitative understanding of the evolutionary processes of self-replicating macromolecules such as RNA or DNA or simple asexual organisms such as bacteria or viruses (see also viral quasispecies), and is helpful in explaining something of the early stages of the origin of life. 

Qing dynasty<====>25310<====>Qing dynasty The Qing dynasty , officially the Great Qing ( ), was the last imperial dynasty of China, established in 1636 and ruling China from 1644 to 1912.  It was preceded by the Ming dynasty and succeeded by the Republic of China.  The Qing multi-cultural empire lasted almost three centuries and formed the territorial base for the modern Chinese state. The dynasty was founded by the Jurchen Aisin Gioro clan in Manchuria.  In the late sixteenth century, Nurhaci, originally a Ming vassal, began organizing "Banners", military-social units that included Jurchen, Han Chinese, and Mongol elements. 

Quantum gravity<====>25312<====>Quantum gravity  Quantum gravity (QG) is a field of theoretical physics that seeks to describe gravity according to the principles of quantum mechanics, and where quantum effects cannot be ignored,  such as near compact astrophysical objects where the effects of gravity are strong. The current understanding of gravity is based on Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which is formulated within the framework of classical physics.  On the other hand, the other three fundamental forces of physics are described within the framework of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, radically different formalisms for describing physical phenomena.   It is sometimes argued that a quantum mechanical description of gravity is necessary on the grounds that one cannot consistently couple a classical system to a quantum one. 

Quality of service<====>25315<====>Quality of service Quality of service (QoS) is the description or measurement of the overall performance of a service, such as a telephony or computer network or a cloud computing service, particularly the performance seen by the users of the network.  To quantitatively measure quality of service, several related aspects of the network service are often considered, such as packet loss, bit rate, throughput, transmission delay, availability, jitter, etc. In the field of computer networking and other packet-switched telecommunication networks, quality of service refers to traffic prioritization and resource reservation control mechanisms rather than the achieved service quality.  Quality of service is the ability to provide different priority to different applications, users, or data flows, or to guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow. 

Quadrature amplitude modulation<====>25316<====>Quadrature amplitude modulation  Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is both an analog and a digital modulation scheme.  It conveys two analog message signals, or two digital bit streams, by changing (modulating) the amplitudes of two carrier waves, using the amplitude-shift keying (ASK) digital modulation scheme or amplitude modulation (AM) analog modulation scheme.  The two carrier waves of the same frequency, usually sinusoids, are out of phase with each other by 90° and are thus called quadrature carriers or quadrature components — hence the name of the scheme.  The modulated waves are summed, and the final waveform is a combination of both phase-shift keying (PSK) and amplitude-shift keying (ASK), or, in the analog case, of phase modulation (PM) and amplitude modulation. 

Quetzalcoatlus<====>25319<====>Quetzalcoatlus Quetzalcoatlus northropi   is an azhdarchid pterosaur known from the Late Cretaceous of North America (Maastrichtian stage) and one of the largest known flying animals of all time.  It is a member of the family Azhdarchidae, a family of advanced toothless pterosaurs with unusually long, stiffened necks.  Its name comes from the Mesoamerican feathered serpent god, Quetzalcoatl. DescriptionSize When it was first named as a new species in 1975, scientists estimated that the largest Quetzalcoatlus fossils came from an individual with a wingspan as large as  , choosing the middle of three extrapolations from the proportions of other pterosaurs that gave an estimate of 11 m, 15. 

Quedlinburg<====>25320<====>QuedlinburgQuedlinburg ( ) is a town situated just north of the Harz mountains, in the district of Harz in the west of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.  In 1994, the castle, church and old town were added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. Quedlinburg has a population of more than 24,000.  The town was the capital of the district of Quedlinburg until 2007, when the district was dissolved.  Several locations in the town are designated stops along a scenic holiday route, the Romanesque Road. HistoryThe town of Quedlinburg is known to have existed since at least the early 9th century, when there was a settlement known as Gross Orden on the eastern bank of the River Bode. 

QRP operation<====>25323<====>QRP operationIn amateur radio, QRP operation refers to transmitting at reduced power while attempting to maximize one's effective range.   The term QRP derives from the standard Q code used in radio communications, where "QRP" and "QRP?" are used to request, "Reduce power", and ask "Should I reduce power?" respectively.  The opposite of QRP is QRO, or high-power operation. PhilosophyMost amateur transceivers are capable of transmitting approximately 100 watts,  but in some parts of the world, such as the U. S. , amateurs can transmit up to 1,500 watts.  QRP enthusiasts contend that this is not always necessary, and doing so wastes power, increases the likelihood of causing interference to nearby televisions, radios, and telephones and, for United States' amateurs, is incompatible with FCC Part 97 rule, which states that one must use "the minimum power necessary to carry out the desired communications". 

Quartet<====>25330<====>Quartet In music, a quartet or quartette  ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ) is an ensemble of four singers or instrumental performers; or a musical composition for four voices or instruments.   ClassicalString quartet In Classical music, the most important combination of four instruments in chamber music is the string quartet.String quartets most often consist of two violins, a viola, and a cello.  The particular choice and number of instruments derives from the registers of the human voice: soprano, alto, tenor and bass. 

Quantum entanglement<====>25336<====>Quantum entanglement Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when pairs or groups of particles are generated or interact in ways such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the others, even when the particles are separated by a large distance—instead, a quantum state must be described for the system as a whole. Measurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization, performed on entangled particles are found to be correlated.  For example, if a pair of particles are generated in such a way that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a certain axis, the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, will be found to be counterclockwise, as to be expected due to their entanglement. 

Quasi-War<====>25343<====>Quasi-War   The Quasi-War ( ) was an undeclared war fought almost entirely at sea between the United States of America and the French Republic from 1798 to 1800.  After the toppling of the French crown during the French Revolutionary Wars, the United States refused to continue repaying its debt to France on the grounds that it had been owed to a previous regime.  French outrage led to a series of attacks on American shipping, ultimately leading to retaliation from the U. S.  The war was called "quasi" because it was undeclared.  It involved two years of hostilities at sea, in which both navies attacked the other's shipping in the West Indies. 

Quality management system<====>25345<====>Quality management system A quality management system (QMS) is a collection of business processes focused on consistently meeting customer requirements and enhancing their satisfaction.  It is aligned with an organization's purpose and strategic direction (ISO9001:2015).  It is expressed as the organizational goals and aspirations, policies, processes, documented information and resources needed to implement and maintain it.  Early quality management systems emphasized predictable outcomes of an industrial product production line, using simple statistics and random sampling.   By the 20th century, labor inputs were typically the most costly inputs in most industrialized societies, so focus shifted to team cooperation and dynamics, especially the early signaling of problems via a continuous improvement cycle. 

Québécois (word)<====>25346<====>Québécois (word)Québécois (pronounced  ; feminine: Québécoise (pronounced  ),   (fem. :  ),  or   (fem. :  )  is a word used primarily to refer to a native or inhabitant of the Canadian province of Quebec, the majority of which speak French as a mother tongue.   It can refer to French spoken in Quebec.  It may also be used, with an upper or lower case initial, as an adjective relating to  Quebec, or to the French culture of Quebec. 

Quantico, Virginia<====>25348<====>Quantico, Virginia  Quantico (formerly Potomac)  is a town in Prince William County, Virginia, United States.   The population was 480 at the 2010 census. Quantico is bordered by the U. S.  military installation of Marine Corps Base Quantico on three sides and the Potomac River on the fourth.  Quantico is located south of the mouth of Quantico Creek on the Potomac.  The word Quantico is a derivation of the name of a Doeg village recorded by English colonists as Pamacocack.  Quantico is the site of one of the largest U. S.  Marine Corps bases, MCB Quantico. 

QSIG<====>25349<====>QSIGQSIG is an ISDN based signaling protocol for signaling between private branch exchanges (PBXs) in a private integrated services network (PISN).  It makes use of the connection-level Q. 931 protocol and the application-level ROSE protocol.   ISDN "proper" functions as the physical link layer. QSIG was originally developed by Ecma International, adopted by ETSI and is defined by a set of ISO standard documents, so is not owned by any company.  This allows interoperability between communications platforms provided by disparate vendors.  QSIG has two layers, called BC (basic call) and GF (generic function).  QSIG BC describes how to set up calls between PBXs. 

Quasicrystal<====>25350<====>Quasicrystal A quasiperiodic crystal, or quasicrystal, is a structure that is ordered but not periodic.  A quasicrystalline pattern can continuously fill all available space, but it lacks translational symmetry.  While crystals, according to the classical crystallographic restriction theorem, can possess only two, three, four, and six-fold rotational symmetries, the Bragg diffraction pattern of quasicrystals shows sharp peaks with other symmetry orders, for instance five-fold. Aperiodic tilings were discovered by mathematicians in the early 1960s, and, some twenty years later, they were found to apply to the study of quasicrystals.  The discovery of these aperiodic forms in nature has produced a paradigm shift in the fields of crystallography. 

Recreation<====>25381<====>Recreation Recreation is an activity of leisure, leisure being discretionary time.The "need to do something for recreation" is an essential element of human biology and psychology.Recreational activities are often done for enjoyment, amusement, or pleasure and are considered to be "fun". EtymologyThe term recreation appears to have been used in English first in the late 14th century, first in the sense of "refreshment or curing of a sick person",  and derived  turn from Latin (re: "again", creare: "to create, bring forth, beget"). Prerequisites to leisureHumans spend their time in activities of daily living, work, sleep, social duties, and leisure, the latter time being free from prior commitments to physiologic or social needs,  a prerequisite of recreation. 

Recession<====>25382<====>Recession    In economics, a recession is a business cycle contraction which results in a general slowdown in economic activity.    Macroeconomic indicators such as GDP (gross domestic product), investment spending, capacity utilization, household income, business profits, and inflation fall, while bankruptcies and the unemployment rate rise.  In the United Kingdom, it is defined as a negative economic growth for two consecutive quarters.  Recessions generally occur when there is a widespread drop in spending (an adverse demand shock).  This may be triggered by various events, such as a financial crisis, an external trade shock, an adverse supply shock or the bursting of an economic bubble. 

RSA (cryptosystem)<====>25385<====>RSA (cryptosystem)  RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission.  In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and it is different from the decryption key which is kept secret (private).  In RSA, this asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty of the factorization of the product of two large prime numbers, the "factoring problem".  The acronym RSA is made of the initial letters of the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who first publicly described the algorithm in 1978.  Clifford Cocks, an English mathematician working for the British intelligence agency Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), had developed an equivalent system in 1973, but this was not declassified until 1997. 

Robert A. Heinlein<====>25389<====>Robert A.  Heinlein  Robert Anson Heinlein ( ;    See also the biography at the end of For Us, the Living, 2004 edition, p.  261. July 7, 1907 – May 8, 1988) was an American science fiction writer.  Often called the "dean of science fiction writers",  his sometimes controversial works continue to have an influential effect on the genre, and on modern culture more generally. Heinlein became one of the first American science fiction writers to break into mainstream magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post in the late 1940s. 

Russia<====>25391<====>RussiaRussia ( ;  ), also officially known as the Russian Federation  ( ), is a sovereign country in Eurasia.At  ,  Russia is the largest country in the world by area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area,    and the ninth most populous, with over 144 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern; about 77% of the population live in European Russia. 

Rational choice theory<====>25400<====>Rational choice theory  Rational choice theory, also known as choice theory or rational action theory, is a framework for understanding and often formally modeling social and economic behavior.   The basic premise of rational choice theory is that aggregate social behavior results from the behavior of individual actors, each of whom is making their individual decisions.  The theory also focuses on the determinants of the individual choices (methodological individualism). Rational choice theory then assumes that an individual has preferences among the available choice alternatives that allow them to state which option they prefer.  These preferences are assumed to be complete (the person can always say which of two alternatives they consider preferable or that neither is preferred to the other) and transitive (if option A is preferred over option B and option B is preferred over option C, then A is preferred over C). 

Romance languages<====>25401<====>Romance languages    The Romance languages (sometimes called the Romanic languages, Latin languages, or Neo-Latin languages) are the modern languages that evolved from Vulgar Latin between the sixth and ninth centuries and that thus form a branch of the Italic languages within the Indo-European language family. Today, around 800 million people are native speakers worldwide, mainly in Europe, Africa and the Americas, but also elsewhere.  Additionally, the major Romance languages have many non-native speakers and are in widespread use as lingua francas.  M.  Paul Lewis, "Summary by language size", Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth Edition. 

Rugby football<====>25402<====>Rugby football   Rugby usually refers to rugby union or sometimes rugby league, which are both team sports, rugby union originating at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, and rugby league originating in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire after splitting and forming the Northern Union in 1896 (what is now known as rugby league).  Rugby football (both league and union) is one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century.  .  Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports.  In addition to the two existing codes, both codes of Gridiron football (American football and Canadian football) have evolved from rugby football, but themselves also completely different sports altogether. 

Rugby union<====>25405<====>Rugby union Rugby union, commonly known in most of the world as rugby, is a contact team sport which originated in England in the first half of the 19th century.   One of the two codes of rugby football, it is based on running with the ball in hand.   In its most common form, a game is between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts on each try line. Rugby union is a popular sport around the world, played by male and female players of all ages. 

Rugby World Cup<====>25406<====>Rugby World CupThe Rugby World Cup is a men's rugby union tournament contested every four years between the top international teams.  The tournament was first held in 1987, when the tournament was co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia. New Zealand are the current champions, having defeated Australia in the final of the 2015 tournament in England. The winners are awarded the William Webb Ellis Cup, named after William Webb Ellis, the Rugby School pupil who — according to a popular legend — invented rugby by picking up the ball during a football game.   Four countries have won the trophy; New Zealand have won it three times, two teams have won twice, Australia and South Africa, while England have won it once. 

Recursion<====>25407<====>Recursion    Recursion occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type.  Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from linguistics to logic.  The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, where a function being defined is applied within its own definition.  While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur. Formal definitionsIn mathematics and computer science, a class of objects or methods exhibit recursive behavior when they can be defined by two properties: A simple base case (or cases)—a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answerA set of rules that reduce all other cases toward the base caseFor example, the following is a recursive definition of a person's ancestors:One's parents are one's ancestors (base case). 

Robert Byrd<====>25408<====>Robert Byrd    Robert Carlyle Byrd (born Cornelius Calvin Sale Jr. ; November 20, 1917 June 28, 2010) was an American politician who served as a United States Senator from West Virginia from 1959 to 2010.  A member of the Democratic Party, Byrd previously served as a U. S.  Representative from 1953 until 1959.  He was the longest-serving Senator in United States history.  In addition, he was, at the time of his death, the longest-serving member in the history of the United States Congress,    a record later surpassed by Representative John Dingell of Michigan. 

Reptile<====>25409<====>Reptile   Reptiles are tetrapod animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives.  The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. Because some reptiles are more closely related to birds than they are to other reptiles (e. g. , crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to lizards), the traditional groups of "reptiles" listed above do not together constitute a monophyletic grouping (or clade).  For this reason, many modern scientists prefer to consider the birds part of Reptilia as well, thereby making Reptilia a monophyletic class. 

Rhode Island<====>25410<====>Rhode Island    Rhode Island ( ),   officially the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations,    is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States.  It is the smallest in area, the eighth least populous, and the second most densely populated of the 50 U. S.  states.  Its official name is also the longest of any state in the Union.  Rhode Island is bordered by Connecticut to the west, Massachusetts to the north and east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound. 

Rock and roll<====>25412<====>Rock and roll   Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s,  Jim Dawson and Steve Propes, What Was the First Rock'n'Roll Record (1992),  .   from African American musical styles such as gospel, jump blues, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues,  along with country music.  Peterson, Richard A.  Creating Country Music: Fabricating Authenticity (1999), p.  9,  .   While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s  and in country records of the 1930s,  the genre did not acquire its name until 1954. 

Religion<====>25414<====>Religion There is no scholarly consensus over what precisely constitutes a religion.    It may be defined as a cultural system of designated behaviors and practices, world views, texts, sanctified places, prophesies, ethics, or organizations, that relate humanity to the supernatural, transcendental, or spiritual. Different religions may or may not contain various elements ranging from the divine,  sacred things,  faith, Tillich, P.  (1957) Dynamics of faith.  Harper Perennial; (p. 1).   a supernatural being or supernatural beings  or "some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life". 

Reed College<====>25417<====>Reed College  Reed College is an independent liberal arts college in southeast Portland in the U. S.  state of Oregon.  Founded in 1908, Reed is a residential college with a campus in Portland's Eastmoreland neighborhood, featuring architecture based on the Tudor-Gothic style,    and a forested canyon nature preserve at its center. Reed is known for its academic rigor, mandatory freshman humanities program, senior thesis, and unusually high proportion of graduates who go on to earn doctorates and other postgraduate degrees.  The college has many prominent alumni, including over a hundred Fulbright Scholars, 67 Watson Fellows, 3 Winston Churchill Scholars, and 32 Rhodes Scholars—the second-highest number of any liberal arts college. 

Proof by contradiction<====>25418<====>Proof by contradictionIn logic, proof by contradiction is a form of proof, and more specifically a form of indirect proof, that establishes the truth or validity of a proposition.   It starts by assuming that the opposite proposition is true, and then shows that such an assumption leads to a contradiction.  Proof by contradiction is also known as indirect proof, apagogical argument, proof by assuming the opposite, and reductio ad impossibilem.  It is a particular kind of the more general form of argument known as reductio ad absurdum.  G.  H.  Hardy,  A Mathematician's Apology; Cambridge University Press, 1992. 

Reversible error<====>25420<====>Reversible error In United States law, a reversible error is an error of sufficient gravity to warrant reversal of a judgment on appeal.   It is an error by the trier of law (judge), or the trier of fact (the jury, or the judge if it is a bench trial), or malfeasance by one of the trying attorneys, which results in an unfair trial.   It is to be distinguished from harmless errors which do not rise to a level which brings the validity of the judgment into question and thus do not lead to a reversal upon appeal. 

Rapping<====>25421<====>RappingRapping (or rhyming, spitting,  emceeing,  MCing  ) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates "rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular",    which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment.    The components of rap include "content" (what is being said), "flow" (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone).   Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track.   Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture.

Rock music<====>25423<====>Rock music   Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States in the early 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and in the United States.  W.  E.  Studwell and D.  F.  Lonergan, The Classic Rock and Roll Reader: Rock Music from its Beginnings to the mid-1970s (Abingdon: Routledge, 1999),It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style which drew heavily on the African-American genres of blues and rhythm and blues, and from country music. 

Retronym<====>25424<====>RetronymA retronym is a newer name for an existing thing that differentiates the original form or version from a more recent one.  It is thus a word created to differentiate between two types, whereas previously (before there were two types) no clarification was required.   Advances in technology are often responsible for the coinage of retronyms.  For example, the term "acoustic guitar" was coined at the advent of electric guitars  and analog watches were thus renamed to distinguish them from digital watches once the latter were invented.    Examples The first bicycles with two wheels of equal size were called "safety bicycles" because they were easier to handle than the then-dominant style that had one large wheel and one small wheel, which then became known as an "ordinary" bicycle.

Roman Polanski<====>25428<====>Roman Polanski    Rajmund Roman Thierry Polański (born 18 August 1933) is a French-Polish  film director, producer, writer, and actor.  Since 1978, he has been a fugitive from the U. S.  criminal justice system where he had been charged with drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl and then fled the country.   Polanski was born in Paris, and his Polish-Jewish parents moved the family back to Poland in 1937, when he was four.  Two years later Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany and the USSR starting World War II during which Polanski spent the next six years of his childhood mostly on his own, trying to survive the ongoing Holocaust. 

Russian language<====>25431<====>Russian language   Russian ( ) is an East Slavic language and an official language in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and many minor or unrecognised territories throughout Eurasia (particularity in Eastern Europe, the Baltics, the Caucasus, and Central Asia).  It is an unofficial but widely spoken language in Latvia, Moldova, Ukraine and to a lesser extent, the other post-Soviet states.Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages and is one of the four living members of the East Slavic languages (which in turn is part of the larger Balto-Slavic branch).  Written examples of Old East Slavonic are attested from the 10th century and beyond. 

Rush (band)<====>25432<====>Rush (band)   Rush were a Canadian rock band composed of Geddy Lee (bass, lead vocals, keyboards), Alex Lifeson (guitars, backing vocals) and Neil Peart (drums, percussion, lyrics).  Forming in 1968, the band went through several configurations until arriving at its current line-up when Peart replaced original drummer John Rutsey in July 1974, two weeks before the group's first United States tour. Rush is known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy, and philosophy.  The band's musical style has changed several times over the years, from a blues-inspired hard rock beginning, later moving into progressive rock, and including a period marked by heavy use of synthesizers.

Reagan was raised in a poor family in small towns of northern Illinois.  He graduated from Eureka College in 1932 and worked as a sports announcer on several regional radio stations. 

Robert J. Flaherty<====>25440<====>Robert J.  Flaherty  Robert Joseph Flaherty, FRGS ( ;  February 16, 1884 – July 23, 1951) was an American filmmaker who directed and produced the first commercially successful feature-length documentary film, Nanook of the North (1922).  The film made his reputation and nothing in his later life fully equaled its success, although he continued the development of this new genre of narrative documentary, e. g.  with Moana (1926), set in the South Seas, and Man of Aran (1934), filmed in Ireland's Aran Islands.  He is considered the "father" of both the documentary and the ethnographic film.

Chambers was an early phrenologist and was the anonymous author of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, which was so controversial that his authorship was not acknowledged until after his death. Early lifeRobert and his elder brother William were both born in the rural town of Peebles in the Borders at the turn of the 19th century. 

Rhetoric<====>25447<====>Rhetoric    Rhetoric is the art of discourse, wherein a writer or speaker strives to inform, persuade or motivate particular audiences in specific situations.  As a subject of formal study and a productive civic practice, rhetoric has played a central role in the European tradition.   Its best known definition comes from Aristotle, who considers it a counterpart of both logic and politics, and calls it "the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion. "  Rhetoric typically provides heuristics for understanding, discovering, and developing arguments for particular situations, such as Aristotle's three persuasive audience appeals, logos, pathos, and ethos. 

Red tide<====>25448<====>Red tide  Red tide is a common name for a phenomenon known as an algal bloom (large concentrations of aquatic microorganisms) when it is caused by a few species of dinoflagellates and the bloom takes on a red or brown color.  Red tides are events in which estuarine, marine, or fresh water algae accumulate rapidly in the water column, resulting in coloration of the surface water.  It is usually found in coastal areas.    These algae, a form of phytoplankton, are single-celled protists, plant-like organisms that can form dense, visible patches near the water's surface. 

Richard Wagner<====>25452<====>Richard Wagner  Wilhelm Richard Wagner ( ;  ; 22 May 1813 13 February 1883) was a German composer, theatre director, polemicist, and conductor who is chiefly known for his operas (or, as some of his later works were later known, "music dramas").  Unlike most opera composers, Wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works.  Initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of Carl Maria von Weber and Giacomo Meyerbeer, Wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk ("total work of art"), by which he sought to synthesise the poetic, visual, musical and dramatic arts, with music subsidiary to drama. 

Rheology<====>25453<====>Rheology Rheology ( ; from Greek ῥέω rhéō, "flow" and -λoγία, -logia, "study of") is the study of the flow of matter, primarily in a liquid state, but also as "soft solids" or solids under conditions in which they respond with plastic flow rather than deforming elastically in response to an applied force.  It is a branch of physics which deals with the deformation and flow of materials, both solids and liquids.   W.  R.  Schowalter (1978) Mechanics of Non-Newtonian Fluids Pergamon   The term   was coined by Eugene C.  Bingham, a professor at Lafayette College, in 1920, from a suggestion by a colleague, Markus Reiner. 

Rifle<====>25456<====>Rifle    A rifle is a portable long-barrelled firearm designed for precision shooting, to be held with both hands and braced against the shoulder during firing, and with a barrel that has a helical pattern of grooves ("rifling") cut into the bore walls.   The term "rifle" was originally "rifled gun", referred to the machining process of creating grooving with cutting tools.   The word "rifle" is now used for any long handheld device designed for aimed discharge activated by a trigger, such as air rifles and the personnel halting and stimulation response rifle.   Rifles are used in warfare, hunting and shooting sports. 

Republic of Texas<====>25457<====>Republic of Texas  The Republic of Texas ( ) was an independent sovereign country in North America that existed from March 2, 1836, to February 19, 1846.  It was bordered by Mexico to the west and southwest, the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast, the two U. S.  states of Louisiana and Arkansas to the east and northeast, and United States territories encompassing parts of the current U. S.  states of Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming to the north.  The citizens of the republic were known as Texians. The Mexican province of   (in English history books usually referred to as Mexican Texas) declared its independence from Mexico during the Texas Revolution in 1836.

Rocky Mountains<====>25459<====>Rocky Mountains  The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America.  The Rocky Mountains stretch more than   from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the Southwestern United States.  Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada, which all lie further to the west. The Rocky Mountains were initially formed from 80 million to 55 million years ago during the Laramide orogeny, in which a number of plates began to slide underneath the North American plate. 

Feminazi<====>25470<====>Feminazi   Feminazi is a pejorative term for those in the feminist movement, popularized by politically conservative American radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh. OriginThe word, used disparagingly, is a portmanteau of the nouns feminist and Nazi.Radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh helped to popularize the term among American conservatives. While Limbaugh initially applied it to pro-choice advocates and other "militants", the term came to be used interchangeably with feminist among opponents of feminism.   In his 1992 book The Way Things Ought to Be, Limbaugh credited Thomas Hazlett, professor of economics at the University of California at Davis, with coining the term. 

Richard Nixon<====>25473<====>Richard Nixon Richard Milhous  Nixon (January 9, 1913 – April 22, 1994) was the 37th President of the United States, serving from 1969 until 1974, when he resigned from office, the only U.

Role-playing game<====>25475<====>Role-playing game   A role-playing game (sometimes spelled roleplaying game  and abbreviated to RPG) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting.  Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development.Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.  There are several forms of RPG.  The original form, sometimes called the tabletop role-playing game (TRPG), is conducted through discussion, whereas in live action role-playing games (LARP) players physically perform their characters' actions. 

Raised-bed gardening<====>25476<====>Raised-bed gardeningRaised-bed gardening is a form of gardening in which the soil is formed in three-to-four-foot-wide (1. 0–1. 2m) beds, which can be of any length or shape.  The soil is raised above the surrounding soil (approximately six inches to waist-high), is sometimes enclosed by a frame generally made of wood, rock, or concrete blocks, and may be enriched with compost.  The vegetable plants are spaced in geometric patterns, much closer together than in conventional row gardening.   The spacing is such that when the vegetables are fully grown, their leaves just barely touch each other, creating a microclimate in which weed growth is suppressed  and moisture is conserved. 

Richard Petty<====>25480<====>Richard Petty    Richard Lee Petty (born July 2, 1937), nicknamed The King, is a former NASCAR driver who raced in the Strictly Stock/Grand National Era and the NASCAR Winston Cup Series.  He won the NASCAR Championship seven times (Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson are the only other drivers to accomplish this feat),    winning a record 200 races during his career,  winning the Daytona 500 a record seven times, and winning a record 27 races  (10 of them consecutively) in the 1967 season alone.   Statistically, he is the most accomplished driver in the history  of the sport and is one of the most respected figures in motorsports as a whole. 

Rosemary<====>25484<====>Rosemary  Rosmarinus officinalis, commonly known as rosemary, is a woody, perennial herb with fragrant, evergreen, needle-like leaves and white, pink, purple, or blue flowers, native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the mint family Lamiaceae, which includes many other herbs.  The name "rosemary" derives from the Latin for "dew" (ros) and "sea" (marinus), or "dew of the sea".   The plant is also sometimes called anthos, from the ancient Greek word ἄνθος, meaning "flower".   Rosemary has a fibrous root system.

Rosales comprise nine families, the type family being the rose family, Rosaceae.  The largest of these families are Rosaceae (90/2500) and Urticaceae (54/2600).  The order Rosales is divided into three clades that have never been assigned a taxonomic rank. 

Rebuttal<====>25488<====>Rebuttal  In law, rebuttal is a form of evidence that is presented to contradict or nullify other evidence that has been presented by an adverse party.  By analogy the same term is used in politics and public affairs to refer to the informal process by which statements, designed to refute or negate specific arguments put forward by opponents, are deployed in the media.  In law, special rules apply to rebuttal; rebuttal evidence or rebuttal witnesses must be confined solely to the subject matter of the evidence rebutted.   New evidence on other subjects may not be brought in rebuttal. 

Res ipsa loquitur<====>25489<====>Res ipsa loquitur  In the common law of torts, res ipsa loquitur (Latin for "the thing speaks for itself") is a doctrine that infers negligence from the very nature of an accident or injury in the absence of direct evidence on how any defendant behaved.  Although modern formulations differ by jurisdiction, common law originally stated that the accident must satisfy the necessary elements of negligence: duty, breach of duty, causation, and injury.  In res ipsa loquitur, the elements of duty of care, breach and causation are inferred from an injury that does not ordinarily occur without negligenceHistoryThe term comes from Latin and is literally translated "the thing itself speaks", but the sense is well conveyed in the more common translation, "the thing speaks for itself. 

The Rocky Horror Picture Show<====>25491<====>The Rocky Horror Picture ShowThe Rocky Horror Picture Show is a 1975 British-American musical comedy sci-fi horror film by 20th Century Fox produced by Lou Adler and Michael White and directed by Jim Sharman.  The screenplay was written by Sharman and actor Richard O'Brien, who appears in the film, which is based on the 1973 musical stage production of the same title, with music, book, and lyrics by O'Brien.  The production is a parody tribute to the science fiction and horror B movies of the 1930s through to the early 1970s.  Along with O'Brien, the film stars Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, and Barry Bostwick and is narrated by Charles Gray with cast members from the original Royal Court Theatre, Roxy Theatre, and Belasco Theatre productions. 

Ridley Scott<====>25493<====>Ridley Scott   Sir Ridley Scott (born 30 November 1937) is an English film director and producer.  Following his commercial breakthrough with the science-fiction horror film Alien, his best known works include the neo-noir dystopian science fiction film Blade Runner, historical drama Gladiator (which won the Academy Award for Best Picture), and science fiction film The Martian. Scott is known for his atmospheric, highly concentrated visual style.   Though his films range widely in setting and period, they frequently showcase memorable imagery of urban environments, whether 2nd century Rome (Gladiator), 12th century Jerusalem (Kingdom of Heaven), Medieval England (Robin Hood), contemporary Mogadishu (Black Hawk Down), the future cityscapes of Blade Runner, or the distant planets in Alien, Prometheus, The Martian and Alien: Covenant. 

History of the Republic of the Congo<====>25495<====>History of the Republic of the Congo The history of the Republic of the Congo has been marked by diverse civilisations: indigenous, French and post-independence. Bantus and PygmiesThe earliest inhabitants of the region comprising present-day Congo were the Bambuti people.  The Bambuti were linked to Pygmy tribes whose Stone Age culture was slowly replaced by Bantu tribes coming from regions north of present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo about 2,000 years ago, introducing Iron Age culture to the region.  The main Bantu tribe living in the region were the Kongo, also known as Bakongo, who established mostly weak and unstable kingdoms along the mouth, north and south of the Congo River. 

Geography of the Republic of the Congo<====>25496<====>Geography of the Republic of the Congo  The Republic of the Congo is located in the western part of Central Africa.  Situated on the Equator, it is bordered by the Angola exclave of Cabinda to the south (231 km), the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the south and east (1,229 km), the Central African Republic (487 km) and Cameroon (494 km) to the north and Gabon to the west (2,567 km).  Congo has a 169 km long Atlantic coast with several important ports.  The Republic of the Congo covers an area of 342,000 km², of which 341,500 km² is land while 500 km² is water. 

Demographics of the Republic of the Congo<====>25497<====>Demographics of the Republic of the CongoThis article is about the demographic features of the population of the Republic of the Congo, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population. The Republic of the Congo's sparse population is concentrated in the southwestern portion of the country, leaving the vast areas of tropical jungle in the north virtually uninhabited.  Thus, Congo is one of the most urbanized countries in Africa, with 85% of its total population living in a few urban areas, namely in Brazzaville, Pointe-Noire, or one of the small cities or villages lining the   railway which connects the two cities. 

Politics of the Republic of the Congo<====>25498<====>Politics of the Republic of the Congo Politics of the Republic of the Congo takes place in a framework of a unitary semi-presidential republic, whereby the President is the head of state and the Prime Minister is the head of government, of a pluriform multi-party system.  Executive power is exercised by the President and the Government.  Recently, following the approval of a new Constitution after a referendum in 2015, Congo became a semi-presidential republic after the creation of the post of prime minister who is responsible to the legislature, as well is the cabinet of the former.  Legislative power is vested in both the Government and the two chambers of parliament. 

Economy of the Republic of the Congo<====>25499<====>Economy of the Republic of the Congo  The economy of the Republic of the Congo is a mixture of subsistence hunting and agriculture, an industrial sector based largely on petroleum extraction and support services, and a government spending,    characterized by budget problems and overstaffing.  Petroleum has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy, providing a major share of government revenues and exports.   Nowadays the country is increasingly converting natural gas to electricity rather than burning it, greatly improving energy prospects.  Historical overviewEarlier in the 1990s, Congo's major employer was the state bureaucracy, which had a payroll of 80,000, which is enormous for a country of Congo's size.

The country also has a large port on the Atlantic Ocean at Pointe-Noire and others along the Congo River at Brazzaville and Impfondo. Railways total:795 km (includes 285 km private track)  -  Congo-Ocean Railway connects Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire.  narrow gauge:795 km 1. 

Armed Forces of the Republic of the Congo<====>25502<====>Armed Forces of the Republic of the Congo   The Armed Forces of the Republic of the Congo ( ), also less formally denoted as the Forces armées congolaises or its acronym FAC, are the military forces of the Republic of the Congo.  They consist of the Congolese Army, the Congolese Air Force, and the Congolese Marine (Navy).  The dissolution of French Equatorial Africa in 1958, and France's impending military withdrawal from the Congo in August 1960, provided the impetuous for the formation of the FAC.  The FAC and state paramilitary agencies are headed by an Armed Forces Chief of General Staff, usually appointed by the President of the Republic of the Congo. 

Foreign relations of the Republic of the Congo<====>25503<====>Foreign relations of the Republic of the Congo  For the two decades preceding the Republic of the Congo's 1991 National Conference, the country was firmly in the socialist camp, allied principally with the Soviet Union and other Eastern bloc nations.  Educational, economic, and foreign aid links between Congo and its Eastern bloc allies were extensive, with the Congolese military and security forces receiving significant Soviet, East German, and Cuban assistance. After the worldwide dissolution of the Soviet Union and Congo's adoption of multi-party democracy in 1991, Congo's bilateral relations with its former socialist allies have become relatively less important.

Reich<====>25519<====>Reich   Reich ( ;   ) is a German word literally meaning "realm".  The terms   (literally "realm of an emperor") and   (literally "realm of a king") are used in German to refer to empires and kingdoms respectively. As such, the term Deutsches Reich (often translated to "German Empire") continued to be used even after the collapse of the German Empire and abolition of the monarchy in 1918, without any imperial connotations. The term derives from the Germanic word meaning "realm" in general, but is typically used in German to designate a kingdom or an empire, especially the Roman Empire. 

Reggae<====>25520<====>Reggae    Reggae ( ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s.  The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora.   A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals, "Do the Reggay" was the first popular song to use the word "reggae," effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience.    While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term reggae more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. 

Relay league<====>25521<====>Relay league A relay league is a chain of message forwarding stations in a system of optical telegraphs, radio telegraph stations, or riding couriers. An interesting description of these early 19th century methods and its evolution into the electrical telegraph networks of the mid-to-late 19th century is found in The Victorian Internet, a book by Tom Standage  . Radio relay leaguesRadio amateurs have been early in arranging relay leagues, as is reflected in the name of the organization of American Radio Relay League (ARRL),   amateur message relay operations were originally conducted using Morse code in the first two decades of the 20th century using spark-gap transmitters. 

History of radio<====>25522<====>History of radio  The early history of radio is the history of technology that produces and uses radio instruments that use radio waves.   Within the timeline of radio, many people contributed theory and inventions in what became radio.  The Invention of Radio inventors. about. com/od/rstartinventions/a/radio. htm  Radio development began as "wireless telegraphy".   Later radio history increasingly involves matters of broadcasting. Summary Invention The idea of wireless communication predates the discovery of "radio" with experiments in "wireless telegraphy" via inductive and capacitive induction and transmission through the ground, water, and even train tracks from the 1830s on. 

Richard Feynman<====>25523<====>Richard Feynman    Richard Phillips Feynman ( ; May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) was an American theoretical physicist known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model.  For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. Feynman developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. 

Research<====>25524<====>ResearchResearch comprises "creative and systematic work undertaken to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humans, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications. "  It is used to establish or confirm facts, reaffirm the results of previous work, solve new or existing problems, support theorems, or develop new theories.  A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field.  Research projects can be used to develop further knowledge on a topic, or in the example of a school research project, they can be used to further a student's research prowess to prepare them for future jobs or reports. 

René Descartes<====>25525<====>René Descartes    René Descartes ( ;   ; Latinized: Renatus Cartesius; adjectival form: "Cartesian";  31 March 1596 11 February 1650) was a French philosopher, mathematician, and scientist.  Dubbed the father of modern western philosophy, much of subsequent Western philosophy is a response to his writings,which are studied closely to this day.  A native of the Kingdom of France, he spent about 20 years (1629–49) of his life in the Dutch Republic after serving for a while in the Dutch States Army of Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange and the Stadtholder of the United Provinces.

Romantic comedy film<====>25531<====>Romantic comedy film   Romantic comedy films (also known as the portmanteaus romedy or romcom) are films with light-hearted, humorous plotlines, centered on romantic ideals such as that true love is able to surmount most obstacles.   One dictionary definition is "a funny movie, play, or television program about a love story that ends happily".   Another definition states that its "primary distinguishing feature is a love plot in which two sympathetic and well-matched lovers are united or reconciled".    Romantic comedy films are a certain genre of comedy films as well as of romance films, and may also have elements of screwball comedies. 

Renaissance<====>25532<====>Renaissance    The Renaissance ( ,  )  was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history.  It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Modern age. The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its own invented version of humanism, derived from the concept of Roman Humanitas and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, such as that of Protagoras, who said that "Man is the measure of all things. 

Rheged<====>25533<====>RhegedRheged ( ) was one of the kingdoms of the Hen Ogledd ("Old North"), the Brittonic-speaking region of what is now Northern England and southern Scotland, during the post-Roman era and Early Middle Ages.  It is recorded in several poetic and bardic sources, although its borders are not described in any of them.   Some modern scholars have suggested that it included what is now Cumbria in North West England and possibly extended into Lancashire and Scotland.   In some sources, Rheged is intimately associated with the king Urien Rheged and his family.   Its inhabitants spoke Cumbric, a Brittonic dialect closely related to Old Welsh. 

Romanian language<====>25534<====>Romanian language   Romanian (obsolete spellings Rumanian, Roumanian; autonym: limba română  , "the Romanian language", or românește, lit.  "in Romanian") is a Romance language spoken by approximately 24–26 million people   as a native language, primarily in Romania and Moldova, and by another 4 million people as a second language.  The Latin Union reports 28 million speakers for Romanian, out of whom 24 million are native speakers of the language: Latin Union – The odyssey of languages: ro, es, fr, it, pt; see also Ethnologue report for RomanianIt has official status in Romania and the Republic of Moldova. 

Republic<====>25536<====>Republic   A republic ( ) is a form of government in which the country is considered a "public matter", not the private concern or property of the rulers.  The primary positions of power within a republic are not inherited, but are attained through elections expressing the consent of the governed.  Such leadership positions are therefore expected to fairly represent the citizen body.  It is a form of government under which the head of state is not a monarch.  In American English, the definition of a republic can also refer specifically to a government in which elected individuals represent the citizen body, known elsewhere as a representative democracy (a democratic republic)  and exercise power according to the rule of law (a constitutional republic).

Her second and third studio albums, My Truth (1999) and Don't Stop the Music (2002), were only released in her native country.  Robyn returned to international success with her fourth album Robyn (2005), which earned her critical acclaim and a Grammy Award nomination. 

Request for Comments<====>25540<====>Request for Comments  A Request for Comments (RFC) is a type of publication from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Society (ISOC), the principal technical development and standards-setting bodies for the Internet.  An RFC is authored by engineers and computer scientists in the form of a memorandum describing methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet and Internet-connected systems.   It is submitted either for peer review or to convey new concepts, information, or (occasionally) engineering humor.   The IETF adopts some of the proposals published as RFCs as Internet Standards. 

Ragga<====>25596<====>Ragga    Raggamuffin music, usually abbreviated as ragga, is a subgenre of dancehall and reggae music, in which the instrumentation primarily consists of electronic music.  Similar to hip hop, sampling often serves a prominent role in raggamuffin music. Wayne Smith's "Under Mi Sleng Teng", produced by King Jammy in 1985 on a Casio MT-40 synthesizer, is generally recognized as the seminal ragga song.  "Sleng Teng" boosted Jammy's popularity immensely, and other producers quickly released their own versions of the riddim, accompanied by dozens of different vocalists. Ragga is now mainly used as a synonym for dancehall reggae or for describing dancehall with a deejay chatting rather than singjaying or singing on top of the riddim. 

Religious conversion<====>25597<====>Religious conversion   Religious conversion is the adoption of a set of beliefs identified with one particular religious denomination to the exclusion of others.  Thus "religious conversion" would describe the abandoning of adherence to one denomination and affiliating with another.  This might be from one to another denomination within the same religion, for example, from Baptist to Catholic Christianity or from Sunni to Shi'a Islam.   In some cases, religious conversion "marks a transformation of religious identity and is symbolized by special rituals".  People convert to a different religion for various reasons, including: active conversion by free choice due to a change in beliefs,  secondary conversion, deathbed conversion, conversion for convenience, marital conversion, and forced conversion. 

Rubidium<====>25599<====>Rubidium  Rubidium is a chemical element with symbol Rb and atomic number 37.  Rubidium is a soft, silvery-white metallic element of the alkali metal group, with a standard atomic weight of 85. 4678.  Elemental rubidium is highly reactive, with properties similar to those of other alkali metals, including rapid oxidation in air.  On Earth, natural rubidium comprises two isotopes: 72% is the stable isotope,  85 Rb; 28% is the slightly radioactive  87 Rb, with a half-life of 49 billion years—more than three times longer than the estimated age of the universe. German chemists Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff discovered rubidium in 1861 by the newly developed technique, flame spectroscopy. 

Ruthenium<====>25600<====>Ruthenium  Ruthenium is a chemical element with symbol Ru and atomic number 44.  It is a rare transition metal belonging to the platinum group of the periodic table.  Like the other metals of the platinum group, ruthenium is inert to most other chemicals.  The Russian-born scientist of Baltic-German ancestry and a member of the Russian Academy of Science Karl Ernst Claus discovered the element in 1844 at Kazan State University in Russia and named it after the Latin name of his homeland, Rus.  Ruthenium is usually found as a minor component of platinum ores; the annual production is about 20 tonnes. 

Rhodium<====>25601<====>Rhodium   Rhodium is a chemical element with symbol Rh and atomic number 45.  It is a rare, silvery-white, hard, corrosion-resistant and chemically inert transition metal.  It is a noble metal and a member of the platinum group.  It has only one naturally occurring isotope,  103 Rh.  Naturally occurring rhodium is usually found as the free metal, alloyed with similar metals, and rarely as a chemical compound in minerals such as bowieite and rhodplumsite.  It is one of the rarest and most valuable precious metals. Rhodium is found in platinum or nickel ores together with the other members of the platinum group metals. 

Radium<====>25602<====>Radium   Radium is a chemical element with symbol Ra and atomic number 88.  It is the sixth element in group 2 of the periodic table, also known as the alkaline earth metals.  Pure radium is silvery-white, but it readily reacts with nitrogen (rather than oxygen) on exposure to air, forming a black surface layer of radium nitride (Ra 3 N 2 ).  All isotopes of radium are highly radioactive, with the most stable isotope being radium-226, which has a half-life of 1600 years and decays into radon gas (specifically the isotope radon-222).  When radium decays, ionizing radiation is a product, which can excite fluorescent chemicals and cause radioluminescence. 

Rhenium<====>25603<====>Rhenium    Rhenium is a chemical element with symbol Re and atomic number 75.  It is a silvery-white, heavy, third-row transition metal in group 7 of the periodic table.  With an estimated average concentration of 1 part per billion (ppb), rhenium is one of the rarest elements in the Earth's crust.  Rhenium has the third-highest melting point and second-highest boiling point of any element at 5903 K.  Rhenium resembles manganese and technetium chemically and is mainly obtained as a by-product of the extraction and refinement of molybdenum and copper ores.  Rhenium shows in its compounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7. 

Radon<====>25604<====>Radon  Radon is a chemical element with symbol Rn and atomic number 86.  It is a radioactive, colorless, odorless, tasteless    noble gas.  It occurs naturally in minute quantities as an intermediate step in the normal radioactive decay chains through which thorium and uranium slowly decay into lead and various other short-lived radioactive elements; radon itself is the immediate decay product of radium.  Its most stable isotope,  222 Rn, has a half-life of only 3. 8 days, radon is a relatively rare gas.  Since thorium and uranium are two of the most common radioactive elements on Earth, and they have three isotopes with very long half-lives, on the order of several billions of years, radon will be present on Earth long into the future in spite of its short half-life as it is continually being regenerated.

Random access<====>25612<====>Random access  In computer science, random access (more precisely and more generally called direct access) is the ability to access any item of data from a population of addressable elements roughly as easily and efficiently as any other, no matter how many elements may be in the set.  It is typically contrasted to sequential access.

First used to refer to speakers of a common language and then to denote national affiliations, by the 17th century race began to refer to physical (phenotypical) traits.  The term was often used in a general biological taxonomic sense,  starting from the 19th century, to denote genetically differentiated human populations defined by phenotype.

Random variable<====>25685<====>Random variable  In probability and statistics, a random variable, random quantity, aleatory variable, or stochastic variable is a variable  whose possible values are numerical  outcomes of a random phenomenon.   As a function, a random variable is required to be measurable, which rules out certain pathological cases where the quantity which the random variable returns is infinitely sensitive to small changes in the outcome. It is common that these outcomes depend on some physical variables that are not well understood.  For example, when tossing a coin, the final outcome of heads or tails depends on the uncertain physics.

FamilyMusil was born in Klagenfurt, Carinthia, the son of engineer Alfred Edler von He was baptized Robert Mathias Musil and his name was officially Robert Mathias Edler von Musil from 22 October 1917, when his father received a hereditary title of nobility Edler, until 3 April 1919, when the use of noble titles was forbidden in Austria. 

Geography of Russia<====>25702<====>Geography of Russia  The geography of Russia describes the geographic features of Russia, a country extending over much of northern Eurasia.  Comprising much of eastern Europe and northern Asia, it is the world's largest country in total area.Due to its size, Russia displays both monotony and diversity.  As with its topography, its climates, vegetation, and soils span vast distances.From north to south the East European Plain is clad sequentially in tundra, coniferous forest (taiga), mixed and broadleaf forests, grassland (steppe), and semi-desert (fringing the Caspian Sea) as the changes in vegetation reflect the changes in climate. 

Demographics of Russia<====>25703<====>Demographics of Russia    The demographics of Russia is about the demographic features of the population of the Russian Federation including population growth, population density, ethnic composition, education level, health, economic status and other aspects. As of 1 January 2017, the population of Russia is 144,498,215 excluding Crimea and Sevastopol, whose annexation is not recognized by most UN members.  Including Crimea and Sevastopol, the population is 146,804,372 as of January 1, 2017.   Around 77% of its population lives in European Russia, while the 23% lives in its Asian part.  As of 2015, the Russian Total fertility rate (TFR) of 1. 

Politics of Russia<====>25704<====>Politics of Russia   The politics of Russia (the Russian Federation) takes place in the framework of a federal semi-presidential republic.  According to the Constitution of Russia, the President of Russia is head of state, and of a multi-party system with executive power exercised by the government, headed by the Prime Minister, who is appointed by the President with the parliament's approval.  Legislative power is vested in the two houses of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, while the President and the government issue numerous legally binding by-laws. Since gaining its independence with the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991, Russia has faced serious challenges in its efforts to forge a political system to follow nearly seventy-five years of Soviet rule. 

Economy of Russia<====>25705<====>Economy of Russia    Russia has an upper-middle income  [1], World Bank  mixed economy with state ownership in strategic areas of the economy.  Market reforms in the 1990s privatized much of Russian industry and agriculture, with notable exceptions to this privatization occurring in the energy and defense-related sectors. Russia's vast geography is an important determinant of its economic activity, with some sources estimating that Russia contains over 30 percent of the world's natural resources.  Kevin M.  Korabik, Russia's Natural Resources and their Economic Effects, Penn State College of Earth and Mineral Sciences, 1 December 1997    The World Bank estimates the total value of Russia's natural resources at $75 trillion US dollars. 

Telecommunications in Russia<====>25706<====>Telecommunications in RussiaCensorship and the issue of Media freedom in Russia have been main themes since the era of the telegraph.   Radio was a major new technology in the 1920s, when the Communists had recently come to power.  Soviet authorities realized that the "ham" operator was highly individualistic and encouraged private initiative– too much so for the totalitarian regime.  Criminal penalties were imposed but the working solution was to avoid broadcasting over the air.  Instead radio programs were transmitted by copper wire, using a hub and spoke system, to loudspeakers in approved listening stations, such as the "Red" corner of a factory. 

Transport in Russia<====>25707<====>Transport in Russia The transport network of the Russian Federation is one of the world's most extensive transport networks.  The national web of roads, railways and airways stretches almost   from Kaliningrad in the west to the Kamchatka Peninsula in the east, and major cities such as Moscow and Saint Petersburg are served by extensive rapid transit systems. Russia has adopted two national transport strategies in recent years.  On 12 May 2005, the Russian Ministry of Transport adopted the Transport Strategy of the Russian Federation to 2020.  Three years later, on 22 November 2008, the Russian government adopted a revised strategy, extending to 2030. 

Foreign relations of Russia<====>25708<====>Foreign relations of Russia  The foreign relations of the Russian Federation is the policy of the Russian government by which it guides the interactions with other nations, their citizens and foreign organizations.  This article covers the foreign policy of the Russian Federation since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in late 1991.  HistoryFor the Russian Empire to 1917 see Foreign policy of the Russian Empire. For the Communist Era (1917–1991), see Soviet Union and Soviet Empire. NATO and the European UnionRussia is a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Union of Russia and Belarus, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Paris Club, and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC). 

Russian Armed Forces<====>25709<====>Russian Armed ForcesThe Armed Forces of the Russian Federation ( ) are the military service of the Russian Federation, established after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.  On 7 May 1992, Boris Yeltsin signed a presidential decree establishing the Russian Ministry of Defence and placing all Soviet Armed Forces troops on the territory of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic under Russian control.   The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces is the President of Russia.  The Russian Armed Forces were formed in 1992. Service BranchesArmed forces under the Ministry of Defence are divided into: the three "branches of Armed Forces" (вида вооружённых сил): the Ground Forces, Aerospace Forces, and the Navythe two "separate troop branches" (Отдельные рода войск): the Strategic Missile Troops and the Airborne Troopsthe Logistical Support, which has a separate status of its ownThere are additionally two further "separate troop branches", the National Guard and the Border Service. 

Railway Mail Service<====>25714<====>Railway Mail ServiceThe United States Postal Service's Railway Mail Service was a significant mail transportation service in the US during the time period from the mid-19th century until the mid-20th century.  The RMS, or its successor the Postal Transportation Service (PTS), carried the vast majority of letters and packages mailed in the United States from the 1890s until the 1960s. HistoryGeorge B.  Armstrong, manager of the Chicago Post Office, is generally credited with being the founder of the concept of en route mail sorting aboard trains which became the Railway Mail Service.   Mail had been carried in locked pouches aboard trains prior to Armstrong's involvement with the system, but there had been no organized system of sorting mail en route, to have mail prepared for delivery when the mail pouches reached their destination city. 

Rail transport<====>25715<====>Rail transportRail transport is a means of transferring of passengers and goods on wheeled vehicles running on rails, also known as tracks.  It is also commonly referred to as train transport.  In contrast to road transport, where vehicles run on a prepared flat surface, rail vehicles (rolling stock) are directionally guided by the tracks on which they run.  Tracks usually consist of steel rails, installed on ties (sleepers) and ballast, on which the rolling stock, usually fitted with metal wheels, moves.  Other variations are also possible, such as slab track, where the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on a prepared subsurface. 

Refreshable braille display<====>25716<====>Refreshable braille displayA refreshable braille display or braille terminal is an electro-mechanical device for displaying braille characters, usually by means of round-tipped pins raised through holes in a flat surface.  Blind computer users who cannot use a computer monitor can use it to read text output.  Speech synthesizers are also commonly used for the same task, and a blind user may switch between the two systems or use both at the same time depending on circumstances.   Deafblind computer users may also use refreshable braille displays. Mechanical detailsThe base of a refreshable braille display often integrates a pure braille keyboard. 

Regular expression<====>25717<====>Regular expression A regular expression, regex or regexp  (sometimes called a rational expression)  is, in theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.  Usually this pattern is then used by string searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings. The concept arose in the 1950s when the American mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene formalized the description of a regular language.  The concept came into common use with Unix text-processing utilities.  Since the 1980s , different syntaxes for writing regular expressions exist, one being the POSIX standard and another, widely used, being the Perl syntax. 

Red Dwarf<====>25721<====>Red DwarfRed Dwarf is a British science fiction comedy franchise which primarily consists of a television sitcom that aired on BBC Two between 1988 and 1999, and on Dave since 2009, gaining a cult following.   To date, eleven full series of the show plus one "special" miniseries have aired.  The latest series, dubbed Red Dwarf XII, started airing in October 2017.  The series was created by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor.  In addition to the television episodes, there are four novels, a radio version adapted from the audiobooks, two pilot episodes for an American version of the show, tie-in books, magazines, and other merchandise. 

Regular language<====>25723<====>Regular language  In theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a regular language (also called a rational language  ) is a formal language that can be expressed using a regular expression, in the strict sense of the latter notion used in theoretical computer science (as opposed to many regular expressions engines provided by modern programming languages, which are augmented with features that allow recognition of languages that cannot be expressed by a classic regular expression). Alternatively, a regular language can be defined as a language recognized by a finite automaton.  The equivalence of regular expressions and finite automata is known as Kleene's theorem    (after American mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene). 

Reference work<====>25727<====>Reference work   A reference work is a book or periodical (or its electronic equivalent) to which one can refer for information.  The information is intended to be found quickly when needed.  Reference works are usually referred to for particular pieces of information, rather than read beginning to end.  The writing style used in these works is informative; the authors avoid use of the first person, and emphasize facts.  Many reference works are compiled by a team of contributors whose work is coordinated by one or more editors rather than by an individual author.  Indices are commonly provided in many types of reference work. 

Roger Casement<====>25730<====>Roger CasementRoger David Casement (1 September 1864 – 3 August 1916), formerly known as Sir Roger Casement CMG between 1911 and shortly before his execution for treason, when he was stripped of his knighthood and other honours,   Casement had renounced all his titles in a letter to British Foreign Secretary dated 1 February 1915.   was a British civil servant who worked for the British Foreign Office as a diplomat, and later became a humanitarian activist, Irish nationalist, and poet.  Described as the "father of twentieth-century human rights investigations",  he was honoured in 1905 for the Casement Report on the Congo and knighted in 1911 for his important investigations of human rights abuses in Peru. 

Real Irish Republican Army<====>25731<====>Real Irish Republican Army   The Real Irish Republican Army or Real IRA (RIRA), is a dissident Irish republican paramilitary organisation which aims to bring about a united Ireland.  It formed in 1997 following a split in the Provisional IRA by dissident members, who rejected the IRA's ceasefire that year.  Like the Provisional IRA before it, the RIRA sees itself as the only rightful successor to the original Irish Republican Army and styles itself as "the Real Irish Republican Army" in English or Óglaigh na hÉireann in Irish.  It is an illegal organisation in the Republic of Ireland and designated as proscribed terrorist organisation in the United Kingdom and the United States. 

Roy Chapman Andrews<====>25732<====>Roy Chapman Andrews  For the former professional American football coach see LeRoy AndrewsRoy Chapman Andrews (January 26, 1884 – March 11, 1960) was an American explorer, adventurer and naturalist who became the director of the American Museum of Natural History.   He is primarily known for leading a series of expeditions through the politically disturbed China of the early 20th century into the Gobi Desert and Mongolia.  The expeditions made important discoveries and brought the first-known fossil dinosaur eggs to the museum.  His popular writings about his adventures made him famous. BiographyEarly life and educationAndrews was born on January 26, 1884, in Beloit, Wisconsin. 

Taiwan<====>25734<====>Taiwan   Taiwan ( ) , officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a state in East Asia.   Its neighbors include the People's Republic of China (PRC) to the west, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous state and largest economy that is not a member of the United Nations. The island of Taiwan, formerly known as Formosa, was inhabited by aborigines before the 17th century, when Dutch and Spanish colonies opened the island to mass Han immigration.  After a brief rule by the Kingdom of Tungning, the island was annexed by the Qing dynasty, the last dynasty of China. 

Rugby league<====>25735<====>Rugby league   Rugby league football is a full-contact sport played by two teams of thirteen players on a rectangular field. One of the two codes of rugby, it originated in Northern England in 1895 as a split from the Rugby Football Union over the issue of payments to players.  Tony Collins, Rugby League in Twentieth Century Britain (2006), p. 3  Its rules progressively changed with the aim of producing a faster, more entertaining game for spectators.    In rugby league, points are scored by carrying the ball and touching it to the ground beyond the opposing team's goal line; this is called a try, and is the primary method of scoring. 

Rowing (sport)<====>25736<====>Rowing (sport)   Rowing, often referred to as crew in the United States,  is a sport whose origins reach back to Ancient Egyptian times.  It involves propelling a boat (racing shell) on water using oars.  By pushing against the water with an oar, a force is generated to move the boat.  The sport can be either recreational for enjoyment or fitness, or competitive, when athletes race against each other in boats.There are a number of different boat classes in which athletes compete, ranging from an individual shell (called a single scull) to an eight-person shell with coxswain (called a coxed eight). 

RuneQuest<====>25737<====>RuneQuest   RuneQuest is a fantasy role-playing game first published in 1978 by Chaosium, created by Steve Perrin and set in Greg Stafford's mythical world of Glorantha.  RuneQuest is notable for its system, designed around a percentile die and with an early implementation of skill rules, which became the basis of numerous other games.  There have been several editions of the game. HistoryIn 1975, game designer Greg Stafford released the fantasy board game White Bear and Red Moon (later renamed Dragon Pass), produced and marketed by Chaosium, a game publishing company set up by Stafford specifically for the release of the game.

Robert E. Lee<====>25740<====>Robert E.  LeeRobert Edward Lee (January 19, 1807 – October 12, 1870) was an American and Confederate soldier, best known as a commander of the  Confederate States Army.  He commanded the Army of Northern Virginia in the American Civil War from 1862 until his surrender in 1865.  A son of Revolutionary War officer Henry "Light Horse Harry" Lee III, Lee was a top graduate of the United States Military Academy and an exceptional officer and military engineer in the United States Army for 32 years.  During this time, he served throughout the United States, distinguished himself during the Mexican–American War, and served as Superintendent of the United States Military Academy. 

Raster graphics<====>25742<====>Raster graphics In computer graphics, a raster graphics or bitmap image is a dot matrix data structure, representing a generally rectangular grid of pixels, or points of color, viewable via a monitor, paper, or other display medium.  Raster images are stored in image files with varying formats.   A bitmap, a single-bit raster,  corresponds bit-for-bit with an image displayed on a screen, generally in the same format used for storage in the display's video memory, or maybe as a device-independent bitmap.  A raster is technically characterized by the width and height of the image in pixels and by the number of bits per pixel (or color depth, which determines the number of colors it can represent). 

Rerun<====>25745<====>Rerun  A rerun or repeat is a rebroadcast of an episode of a radio or television program.  There are two types of reruns – those that occur during a hiatus, and those that occur when a program is syndicated.  Reruns can also be, as the case with more popular shows, when a show is aired outside its timeslot (for example, in the afternoon). VariationsIn the United Kingdom, the word "repeat" refers only to a single episode; "rerun" or "rerunning" is the preferred term for an entire series/season.  A "repeat" is a single episode of a series that is broadcast outside its original timeslot on the same channel/network. 

Router (computing)<====>25748<====>Router (computing) A router  is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks.  Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet.  A data packet is typically forwarded from one router to another router through the networks that constitute an internetwork until it reaches its destination node.  A router is connected to two or more data lines from different networks.   When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, the router reads the network address information in the packet to determine the ultimate destination.   Then, using information in its routing table or routing policy, it directs the packet to the next network on its journey. 

Routing<====>25750<====>Routing Routing is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network, or between or across multiple networks.  Routing is performed for many types of networks, including circuit-switched networks, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN), computer networks, such as the Internet. In packet switching networks, routing is the higher-level decision making that directs network packets from their source toward their destination through intermediate network nodes by specific packet forwarding mechanisms.  Packet forwarding is the transit of logically addressed network packets from one network interface to another.   Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such as routers, bridges, gateways, firewalls, or switches. 

Resistor<====>25754<====>Resistor A  resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.  In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses.  High-power resistors that can dissipate many watts of electrical power as heat, may be used as part of motor controls, in power distribution systems, or as test loads for generators.  Fixed resistors have resistances that only change slightly with temperature, time or operating voltage.  Variable resistors can be used to adjust circuit elements (such as a volume control or a lamp dimmer), or as sensing devices for heat, light, humidity, force, or chemical activity. 

Republicanism<====>25755<====>Republicanism  Republicanism is an ideology centered on citizenship in a state organized as a republic under which the people hold popular sovereignty.   Many countries are "republics" in the sense that they are not monarchies.  This article covers only the ideology of republicanism.  The word "republic" derives from the Latin noun-phrase res publica, which referred to the system of government that emerged in the 6th century BC following the semi-legendary   expulsion of the kings from Rome by Lucius Junius Brutus and Collatinus.

Repetitive strain injury<====>25756<====>Repetitive strain injury  A repetitive strain injury (RSI) is an "injury to the musculoskeletal and nervous systems that may be caused by repetitive tasks, forceful exertions, vibrations, mechanical compression, or sustained or awkward positions".  Public Employees Occupational Safety and Health Program of the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services Signs and symptomsSome examples of symptoms experienced by patients with RSI are aching, pulsing pain, tingling and extremity weakness, initially presenting with intermittent discomfort and then, with a higher degree of frequency.  DefinitionRepetitive strain injury (RSI) and associative trauma orders are umbrella terms used to refer to several discrete conditions that can be associated with repetitive  tasks, forceful  exertions, vibrations,  mechanical compression, or  sustained/awkward  positions. 

Robertson Davies<====>25757<====>Robertson Davies  William Robertson Davies, CC, OOnt, FRSC, FRSL (28 August 1913 – 2 December 1995) was a Canadian novelist, playwright, critic, journalist, and professor.  He was one of Canada's best known and most popular authors and one of its most distinguished "men of letters", a term Davies is variously said to have both gladly accepted for himself and to have detested.   Davies was the founding Master of Massey College, a graduate residential college associated with the University of Toronto. BiographyEarly lifeDavies was born in Thamesville, Ontario, the third son of William Rupert Davies and Florence Sheppard McKay. 

RNA<====>25758<====>RNA  Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes.  RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, constitute the four major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life.  Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides, but unlike DNA it is more often found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand.  Cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to convey genetic information (using the letters G, U, A, and C to denote the nitrogenous bases guanine, uracil, adenine, and cytosine) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. 

Russian Revolution<====>25762<====>Russian Revolution The Russian Revolution was a pair of revolutions in Russia in 1917 which dismantled the Tsarist autocracy and led to the rise of the Soviet Union.  The Russian Empire collapsed with the abdication of Emperor Nicholas II and the old regime was replaced by a provisional government during the first revolution of February 1917 (March in the Gregorian calendar; the older Julian calendar was in use in Russia at the time).  Alongside it arose grassroots community assemblies (called 'soviets') which contended for authority.  In the second revolution that October, the Provisional Government was toppled and all power was given to the soviets. 

Raven Software<====>25764<====>Raven Software  Raven Software (or Raven Entertainment Software, Inc. ) is an American video game developing company based in Wisconsin and founded in 1990.  In 1997, Raven made an exclusive publishing deal with Activision and was subsequently acquired by them.  After the acquisition, many of the studio's original developers, largely responsible for creating the Heretic and Hexen: Beyond Heretic games, left to form Human Head Studios. HistoryRaven Software was founded in 1990 by brothers Brian and Steve Raffel.  The company was independent until 1997 when it was acquired by Activision. Raven has a history of working with id Software, who were briefly located on the same street. 

RNA world<====>25765<====>RNA world The RNA world is a hypothetical stage in the evolutionary history of life on Earth, in which self-replicating RNA molecules proliferated before the evolution of DNA and proteins.   The term also refers to the hypothesis that posits the existence of this stage. The concept of the RNA world was first proposed in 1962 by Alexander Rich,    and the term was coined by Walter Gilbert in 1986.Alternative chemical paths to life have been proposed,    and RNA-based life may not have been the first life to exist. 

Ribosome<====>25766<====>Ribosome  The ribosome (  ) is a complex molecular machine, found within all living cells, that serves as the site of biological protein synthesis (translation).  Ribosomes link amino acids together in the order specified by messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules.  Ribosomes consist of two major components: the small ribosomal  subunit, which reads the RNA, and the large subunit, which joins amino acids to form a polypeptide chain.  Each subunit is composed of one or more ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules and a variety of ribosomal proteins (r-protein or rProtein   ).  The ribosomes and associated molecules are also known as the translational apparatus. 

Real-time computing<====>25767<====>Real-time computing In computer science, real-time computing (RTC), or reactive computing describes hardware and software systems subject to a "real-time constraint", for example from event to system response.   Real-time programs must guarantee response within specified time constraints, often referred to as "deadlines".  Ben-Ari, M. , "Principles of Concurrent and Distributed Programming", Prentice Hall, 1990.   .  Ch16, Page 164   The correctness of these types of systems depends on their temporal aspects as well as their functional aspects.  Real-time responses are often understood to be in the order of milliseconds, and sometimes microseconds. 

Ruby (programming language)<====>25768<====>Ruby (programming language)   Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language.  It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan. According to its creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp.   It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative.  It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. HistoryEarly conceptMatsumoto has said that Ruby was conceived in 1993.  In a 1999 post to the ruby-talk mailing list, he describes some of his early ideas about the language:  Matsumoto describes the design of Ruby as being like a simple Lisp language at its core, with an object system like that of Smalltalk, blocks inspired by higher-order functions, and practical utility like that of Perl. 

Render farm<====>25774<====>Render farm A render farm is a high-performance computer system, e. g.  a computer cluster, built to render computer-generated imagery (CGI), typically for film and television visual effects. Origin of the termThe term render farm was born during the production of the Autodesk 3D Studio animated short The Bored Room  in July 1990 when, to meet an unrealistic deadline, a room filled with Compaq 386 computers was configured to do the rendering.  At the time the system wasn't networked so each computer had to be set up by hand to render a specific animation sequence.  The rendered images would then be 'harvested' via a rolling platform to a large-format optical storage drive, then loaded frame by frame to a Sony CRV disc. 

Robert Borden<====>25776<====>Robert Borden  Sir Robert Laird Borden,   (June 26, 1854 – June 10, 1937) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the eighth Prime Minister of Canada, in office from 1911 to 1920.  He is best known for his leadership of Canada during World War I. Borden was born in Grand-Pré, Nova Scotia.  He worked as a schoolteacher for a period and then served his articles of clerkship at a Halifax law firm.  He was called to the bar in 1878, and soon became one of Nova Scotia's most prominent barristers.  Borden was elected to the Canadian House of Commons in 1896, representing the Conservative Party. 

Robot<====>25781<====>Robot  A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer— capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically.   Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within.  Robots may be constructed to take on human form but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to how they look. Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda's Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility (ASIMO) and TOSY's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot (TOPIO) to industrial robots, medical operating robots, patient assist robots, dog therapy robots, collectively programmed swarm robots, UAV drones such as General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, and even microscopic nano robots. 

R. B. Bennett<====>25783<====>R.  B.  Bennett   Richard Bedford Bennett, 1st Viscount Bennett,   (3 July 1870 – 26 June 1947), was a Canadian politician who served as the 11th Prime Minister of Canada, in office from 1930 to 1935.  He led the Conservative Party from 1927 to 1938. Bennett was born in Hopewell Hill, New Brunswick, and grew up in nearby Hopewell Cape.  He studied law at Dalhousie University, graduating in 1893, and in 1897 moved to Calgary to establish a law firm in partnership with James Lougheed.  Bennett served in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories from 1898 to 1905, and later in the Alberta Legislature from 1909 to 1911. 

Renewable energy<====>25784<====>Renewable energy    Renewable energy is energy that is collected from renewable resources, which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat.   Renewable energy often provides energy in four important areas: electricity generation, air and water heating/cooling, transportation, and rural (off-grid) energy services.  REN21 (2010).  Renewables 2010 Global Status Report p.  15.  Based on REN21's 2016 report, renewables contributed 19. 2% to humans' global energy consumption and 23. 7% to their generation of electricity in 2014 and 2015, respectively.  This energy consumption is divided as 8. 

Romulus Augustulus<====>25789<====>Romulus Augustulus  Romulus Augustulus (c.  AD 460–after AD 476; apparently still alive as late as AD 507),  formally known as Romulus Augustus, was a Roman emperor and alleged usurper who ruled the Western Roman Empire from 31 October AD 475 until 4 September AD 476.  His deposition by Odoacer traditionally marks the end of the Roman Empire in the West, the fall of Ancient Rome, and the beginning of the Middle Ages in Western Europe. Although he adopted the name Augustus upon his accession, he is better remembered by his derisive nickname Augustulus.   The Latin suffix -ulus is a diminutive; hence Augustulus effectively means "Little Augustus. 

List of Roman emperors<====>25791<====>List of Roman emperors Roman Emperors were rulers of the Roman Empire, wielding power over its citizens and military.  The empire was developed as the Roman Republic invaded and occupied most of Europe and portions of northern Africa and western Asia.  Under the republic, regions of the empire were ruled by provincial governors answerable to and authorised by the "Senate and People of Rome".  Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates – of whom the consuls were the most powerful.  The republic ended, and the emperors were created, when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates. 

Roman calendar<====>25792<====>Roman calendar   The Roman calendar is the calendar used by the Roman kingdom and republic.  It is often inclusive of the Julian calendar established by the reforms of the dictator Julius Caesar and emperor Augustus in the late 1st century   and sometimes inclusive of any system dated by inclusive counting towards months' kalends, nones, and ides in the Roman manner.  It is usually exclusive of the Alexandrian calendar of Roman Egypt, which continued the unique months of that land's former calendar; the Byzantine calendar of the later Roman Empire, which usually dated the Roman months in the simple count of the ancient Greek calendars; and the Gregorian calendar, which refined the Julian system to bring it into still closer alignment with the solar year and is the basis of the current international standard. 

Revolver<====>25794<====>Revolver  A revolver is a repeating handgun that has a revolving cylinder containing multiple chambers and at least one barrel for firing.  Revolvers might be regarded as a type of pistol, or as a subset of handguns, distinct from pistols, which in this case are defined as handguns with a single chamber.  The revolver allows the user to fire multiple rounds without reloading after every shot, unlike older single shot firearms.  After a round is fired the hammer is either cocked by the shooter manually or by rearward movement of the trigger to turn the next chamber in line with the barrel.

Reykjavík<====>25798<====>Reykjavík   Reykjavík (   ;  )   is the capital and largest city of Iceland.  It is located in southwestern Iceland, on the southern shore of Faxa Bay.  Its latitude is 64°08' N, making it the world's northernmost capital of a sovereign state.  With a population of around 123,300 (and over 216,940 in the Capital Region),  it is the heart of Iceland's cultural, economic and governmental activity, and is a popular tourist destination.    . Reykjavík is believed to be the location of the first permanent settlement in Iceland, which, according to Ingólfur Arnarson, was established in AD 874. 

Retrovirus<====>25799<====>Retrovirus  A retrovirus is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with a DNA intermediate and, as an obligate parasite, targets a host cell.  Once inside the host cell cytoplasm, the virus uses its own reverse transcriptase enzyme to produce DNA from its RNA genome, the reverse of the usual pattern, thus retro (backwards).  The new DNA is then incorporated into the host cell genome by an integrase enzyme, at which point the retroviral DNA is referred to as a provirus.  The host cell then treats the viral DNA as part of its own genome, translating and transcribing the viral genes along with the cell's own genes, producing the proteins required to assemble new copies of the virus. 

Round (music)<====>25801<====>Round (music)A round (also called a perpetual canon [canon perpetuus] or infinite canon) is a musical composition, a limited type of canon, in which a minimum of three voices sing exactly the same melody at the unison (and may continue repeating it indefinitely), but with each voice beginning at different times so that different parts of the melody coincide in the different voices, but nevertheless fit harmoniously together  .  It is one of the easiest forms of part singing, as only one line of melody need be learned by all parts, and is part of a popular musical tradition. 

Reincarnation<====>25806<====>Reincarnation   Reincarnation is the philosophical or religious concept that an aspect of a living being starts a new life in a different physical body or form after each biological death.  It is also called rebirth or transmigration, and is a part of the Saṃsāra doctrine of cyclic existence.    It is a central tenet of all major Indian religions, namely Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism.  The idea of reincarnation is found in many ancient cultures,  and a belief in rebirth/metempsychosis was held by Greek historic figures, such as Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato. 

Robert Noyce<====>25808<====>Robert NoyceRobert Norton Noyce (December 12, 1927 – June 3, 1990), nicknamed "the Mayor of Silicon Valley," was an American engineer who co-founded Fairchild Semiconductor in 1957 and Intel Corporation in 1968.  He is also credited (along with Jack Kilby) with the realization of the first integrated circuit or microchip that fueled the personal computer revolution and gave Silicon Valley its name.  Lécuyer, p.  129  While Kilby's invention was six months earlier, neither man rejected the title of co-inventor.  BiographyNoyce kept active his entire life.  He enjoyed reading Hemingway, and he flew his own airplane and also participated in hang-gliding and scuba diving. 

Riemann zeta function<====>25809<====>Riemann zeta function The Riemann zeta function or Euler–Riemann zeta function,  , is a function of a complex variable s that analytically continues the sum of the Dirichlet series  \zeta(s) =\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n^s} for when the real part of   is greater than 1.  More general representations of   for all   are given below.  The Riemann zeta function plays a pivotal role in analytic number theory and has applications in physics, probability theory, and applied statistics. As a function of a real variable, Leonhard Euler first introduced and studied it in the first half of the eighteenth century without using complex analysis, which was not available at the time.

Early life and educationBorn in Alice, Texas, United States, Curl was the son of a Methodist minister. Due to his father's missionary work, his family moved several times within southern and southwestern Texas, and the elder Curl was involved in starting the San Antonio Medical Center's Methodist Hospital. 

Roman Republic<====>25816<====>Roman Republic   The Roman Republic ( ;  ) was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire.  It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. Roman government was headed by two consuls, elected annually by the citizens and advised by a senate composed of appointed magistrates.  As Roman society was very hierarchical by modern standards, the evolution of the Roman government was heavily influenced by the struggle between the patricians, Rome's land-holding aristocracy, who traced their ancestry to the founding of Rome, and the plebeians, the far more numerous citizen-commoners. 

Rickenbacker<====>25819<====>Rickenbacker   Rickenbacker International Corporation, also known as Rickenbacker, is an electric string instrument manufacturer based in Santa Ana, California.  In 1932, the company became the world's first to produce electric guitars and eventually produced a range of electric guitars and bass guitars.    FoundingThe company was founded in 1931 as the Ro-Pat-In Corporation (ElectRo-Patent-Instruments) by Adolph Rickenbacher and George Beauchamp in order to sell electric Hawaiian guitars.  These instruments had been designed by Beauchamp, assisted at the National String Instrument Corporation by Paul Barth and Harry Watson.    They chose the brand name Rickenbacher (later changed to Rickenbacker), though early examples bear the brand name Electro. 

Romeo and Juliet<====>25821<====>Romeo and Juliet   Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare early in his career about two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families.  It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime and along with Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed plays.  Today, the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers. Romeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to antiquity.   The plot is based on an Italian tale translated into verse as The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562 and retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567. 

Rube Goldberg<====>25822<====>Rube Goldberg   Reuben Garrett Lucius Goldberg (July 4, 1883 – December 7, 1970), known best as Rube Goldberg, was an American cartoonist, sculptor, author, engineer, and inventor. Goldberg is best known for a series of popular cartoons depicting complicated gadgets that perform simple tasks in indirect, convoluted ways, giving rise to the term Rube Goldberg machines for any similar gadget or process.  Goldberg received many honors in his lifetime, including a Pulitzer Prize for his political cartooning in 1948 and the Banshees' Silver Lady Award in 1959.    Goldberg was a founding member and the first president of the National Cartoonists Society,  and he is the namesake of the Reuben Award, which the organization awards to the Cartoonist of the Year. 

Robert Stickgold<====>25823<====>Robert StickgoldRobert Stickgold is an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.   A sleep researcher, his work focuses on the relationship between sleep and learning.  His articles in the popular press are intended to illustrate the dangers of sleep deprivation. Stickgold was born in Chicago.  He graduated from Harvard University before attending the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he received his doctorate in biochemistry.   He worked with the sleep researcher J.  Allan Hobson for many years and has been known to quote Hobson's quip: "The only known function of sleep is to cure sleepiness". 

Religion and mythology<====>25824<====>Religion and mythology Religion and mythology differ in scope but have overlapping aspects.  Both terms refer to systems of concepts that are of high importance to a certain community, making statements concerning the supernatural or sacred.  Generally, mythology is considered one component or aspect of religion.  Religion is the broader term: besides mythological aspects, it includes aspects of ritual, morality, theology, and mystical experience.  A given mythology is almost always associated with a certain religion such as Greek mythology with Ancient Greek religion.  Disconnected from its religious system, a myth may lose its immediate relevance to the community and evolve—away from sacred importance—into a legend or folktale. 

Red<====>25825<====>Red   Red is the colour at the end of the visible spectrum of light, next to orange and opposite violet.  It has a dominant wavelength of approximately  625–740 nanometres.    It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the CMYK color model, and is the complementary color of cyan.  Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy. The red sky at sunset results from Rayleigh scattering, while the red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide. 

Ragnarök<====>25829<====>Ragnarök   In Norse mythology, Ragnarök is a series of future events, including a great battle, foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number of major figures (including the gods Odin, Thor, Týr, Freyr, Heimdallr, and Loki), the occurrence of various natural disasters, and the subsequent submersion of the world in water.  Afterward, the world will resurface anew and fertile, the surviving and returning gods will meet, and the world will be repopulated by two human survivors.  Ragnarök is an important event in Norse mythology, and has been the subject of scholarly discourse and theory throughout the history of Germanic studies. 

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead<====>25830<====>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead    Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, often referred to as just Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, is an absurdist, existentialist tragicomedy by Tom Stoppard, first staged at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1966.  "Edinburgh: Cradle of shows that conquered the world" Independent 2 August 2010The play expands upon the exploits of two minor characters from Shakespeare's Hamlet, the courtiers Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.  The action of Stoppard's play takes place mainly "in the wings" of Shakespeare's, with brief appearances of major characters from Hamlet who enact fragments of the original's scenes. 

RC4<====>25831<====>RC4   In cryptography, RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4 also known as ARC4 or ARCFOUR meaning Alleged RC4, see below) is a stream cipher.  While remarkable for its simplicity and speed in software, multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in RC4, rendering it insecure. It is especially vulnerable when the beginning of the output keystream is not discarded, or when nonrandom or related keys are used.  Particularly problematic uses of RC4 have led to very insecure protocols such as WEP.   , there is speculation that some state cryptologic agencies may possess the capability to break RC4 when used in the TLS protocol. 

Ringo Starr<====>25832<====>Ringo Starr  Sir Richard Starkey,    (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English drummer, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles.  He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including "With a Little Help from My Friends", "Yellow Submarine", "Good Night", and their cover of "Act Naturally".  He also wrote the Beatles' songs "Don't Pass Me By" and "Octopus's Garden", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including "What Goes On" and "Flying". 

Rn (newsreader)<====>25835<====>Rn (newsreader)  rn (short for Read News) is a news client (or 'newsreader') written by Larry Wall and originally released in 1984.   It was one of the first newsreaders to take full advantage of character-addressable CRT terminals (vnews, by Kenneth Almquist was first).  Previous newsreaders, such as readnews, were mostly line-oriented and designed for use on the printing terminals which were common on the early Unix minicomputers where the Usenet software and network originated.   Later variants of the original rn program included rrn, trn, and strn.  Featuresrn was also notable for three other features it introduced: KILL files, "do the right thing", and automatic configuration. 

Rolf Ekéus<====>25837<====>Rolf Ekéus Carl Rolf Ekéus (born 7 July 1935 in Kristinehamn, Sweden) is a Swedish diplomat.   From 1978 to 1983, he was a representative to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, and he has worked on various other disarmament committees and commissions. Between 1991 and 1997 he was director of the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq, the United Nations disarmament observers in Iraq after the Gulf War.   In late July 2002 he reportedly said in the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper that during his time in this position he attempted to resist attempts by the United States to use the Commission to perform espionage. 

Robert Menzies<====>25839<====>Robert Menzies    Sir Robert Gordon Menzies,   (20 December 1894 15 May 1978), was an Australian politician who twice served as Prime Minister of Australia, in office from 1939 to 1941 and again from 1949 to 1966.  He played a central role in the creation of the Liberal Party of Australia, defining its policies and its broad outreach.  He is Australia's longest-serving prime minister, serving over 18 years in total. Menzies studied law at the University of Melbourne and became one of Melbourne's leading lawyers.  He was Deputy Premier of Victoria from 1932 to 1934, and then transferred to federal parliament, subsequently becoming Attorney-General and Minister for Industry in the government of Joseph Lyons. 

Renaissance music<====>25840<====>Renaissance music  Renaissance music is vocal and instrumental music written and performed in Europe during the Renaissance era.  Consensus among music historians has been to start the era around 1400, with the end of the medieval era, and to close it around 1600, with the beginning of the Baroque period, therefore commencing the musical Renaissance about a hundred years after the beginning of the Renaissance as it is understood in other disciplines.  As in the other arts, the music of the period was significantly influenced by the developments which define the Early Modern period: the rise of humanistic thought; the recovery of the literary and artistic heritage of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome; increased innovation and discovery; the growth of commercial enterprises; the rise of a bourgeois class; and the Protestant Reformation. 

Rhine<====>25845<====>Rhine    The Rhine ( ,  ,  ,  ,   ) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the German Rhineland and the Netherlands and eventually empties into the North Sea. The largest city on the  Rhine is Cologne, Germany, with a population of more than 1,050,000 people.  It is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe (after the Danube), at about  , The Rhine is cited as the "twelfth-longest river of Europe"  if the Russian rivers Volga, Ural, Pechora, Kama, Northern Dvina–Vychegda, Oka and Belaya are counted which are based on the modern conventional boundary between Europe and Asia are within European Russia or form part of the boundary to Asia.

Rungholt<====>25848<====>RungholtRungholt was a settlement in Nordfriesland, in what was then the Danish Duchy of Schleswig.  The area is today located in Germany.  Rungholt reportedly sank beneath the waves of the North Sea when a storm tide (known as the second Grote Mandrenke) hit the coast on 15 or 16 January 1362. LocationThe exact location of Rungholt remains unclear.  It is likely that Rungholt was situated on the island of Strand, which was rent asunder by another storm tide in 1634, and of which the islets of Pellworm, Nordstrand and Nordstrandischmoor are the only remaining fragments. One possible location is west of the Hallig Südfall, where in 1921 significant ruins were discovered: wells, trenches and part of a tidal lock. 

Ralph Merkle<====>25849<====>Ralph Merkle Ralph C.  Merkle (born February 2, 1952) is a computer scientist.  He is one of the inventors of public key cryptography, the inventor of cryptographic hashing, and more recently a researcher and speaker of cryonics. ContributionsMerkle devised a scheme for communication over an insecure channel: Merkle's puzzles as part of a class project while an undergraduate.   The scheme is now recognized to be an early example of public key cryptography.  He co-invented the Merkle–Hellman knapsack cryptosystem, invented cryptographic hashing (now called the Merkle–Damgård construction based on a pair of articles published 10 years later that established the security of the scheme), and invented Merkle trees. 

Rice's theorem<====>25852<====>Rice's theoremIn computability theory, Rice's theorem states that all non-trivial, semantic properties of programs are undecidable.  A semantic property is one about the program's behavior (for instance, does the program terminate for all inputs), unlike a syntactic property (for instance, does the program contain an if-then-else statement).  A property is non-trivial if it is neither true for every computable function, nor for no computable function. Rice's theorem can also be put in terms of functions: for any non-trivial property of partial functions, no general and effective method can decide whether an algorithm computes a partial function with that property. 

Recusancy<====>25853<====>Recusancy Recusancy was the state of those who refused to attend Anglican services during the history of England and Wales and of Ireland; these individuals were known as recusants.   The term, which derives ultimately from the Latin recusare (to refuse or make an objection)  was first used to refer to those who remained loyal to the pope and the Roman Catholic Church and who did not attend Church of England services, with a 1593 statute determining the penalties against "Popish recusants".  The "Recusancy Acts" began during the reign of Elizabeth I and were repealed in 1650. 

Regular grammar<====>25855<====>Regular grammar In theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a regular grammar is a formal grammar that is right-regular or left-regular.  Every regular grammar describes a regular language. Strictly regular grammarsA right regular grammar (also called right linear grammar) is a formal grammar (N, Σ, P, S) such that all the production rules in P are of one of the following forms:B → a  - where B is a non-terminal in N and a is a terminal in ΣB → aC  - where B and C are non-terminals in N and a is in ΣB → ε  - where B is in N and ε denotes the empty string, i. 

Radiation<====>25856<====>Radiation    In physics, radiation is the emission or transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles through space or through a material medium.    This includes: electromagnetic radiation, such as radio waves, microwaves, visible light, x-rays, and gamma radiation (γ)particle radiation, such as alpha radiation (α), beta radiation (β), and neutron radiation (particles of non-zero rest energy)acoustic radiation, such as ultrasound, sound, and seismic waves (dependent on a physical transmission medium)gravitational radiation, radiation that takes the form of gravitational waves, or ripples in the curvature of spacetime. Radiation is often categorized as either ionizing or non-ionizing depending on the energy of the radiated particles. 

Rodolphus Agricola<====>25857<====>Rodolphus Agricola Rodolphus Agricola ( ; February 17, 1444? / August 28, 1443?  – October 27, 1485) was a pre-Erasmian humanist of the northern Low Countries, famous for his supple Latin and one of the first north of the Alps to know Greek well.  Agricola was a Hebrew scholar towards the end of his life, an educator, musician and builder of a church organ, a poet in Latin as well as the vernacular, a diplomat and a sportsman of sorts (boxing ).  He is best known today as the author of De inventione dialectica, as the father of northern European humanism and as a zealous anti-scholastic in the late-fifteenth century. 

Ruth Gordon<====>25866<====>Ruth Gordon  Ruth Gordon Jones (October 30, 1896 – August 28, 1985), known as Ruth Gordon, was an American film, stage, and television actress, as well as a screenwriter and playwright.   Gordon began her career performing on Broadway at age nineteen.  Known for her nasal voice and distinctive personality, she gained international recognition and critical acclaim for film roles that continued into her seventies and eighties.  Her later work included performances in Rosemary's Baby (1968), Harold and Maude (1971), and the Clint Eastwood films Every Which Way but Loose (1978) and Any Which Way You Can (1980). 

Richard Dawkins<====>25867<====>Richard Dawkins Clinton Richard Dawkins   (born 26 March 1941) is an English ethologist, evolutionary biologist and author.  He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008. Dawkins first came to prominence with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term meme.  With his book The Extended Phenotype (1982), he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism's body, but can stretch far into the environment. 

Code refactoring<====>25871<====>Code refactoring  Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior.  Refactoring improves nonfunctional attributes of the software.  Advantages include improved code readability and reduced complexity; these can improve source-code maintainability and create a more expressive internal architecture or object model to improve extensibility.  Typically, refactoring applies a series of standardised basic micro-refactorings, each of which is (usually) a tiny change in a computer program's source code that either preserves the behaviour of the software, or at least does not modify its conformance to functional requirements.  Many development environments provide automated support for performing the mechanical aspects of these basic refactorings. 

Relational database<====>25873<====>Relational database A relational database is a digital database based on the relational model of data, as proposed by E.  F.  Codd in 1970.  A software system used to maintain relational databases is a relational database management system (RDBMS).  Virtually all relational database systems use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and maintaining the database.   Relational model This model organizes data into one or more tables (or "relations") of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row.  Rows are also called records or tuples.   Columns are also called attributes. 

Rule of Saint Benedict<====>25874<====>Rule of Saint Benedict The Rule of Saint Benedict ( ) is a book of precepts written by Benedict of Nursia (  AD 480–550) for monks living communally under the authority of an abbot. The spirit of Saint Benedict's Rule is summed up in the motto of the Benedictine Confederation: pax ("peace") and the traditional ora et labora ("pray and work").   Compared to other precepts, the Rule provides a moderate path between individual zeal and formulaic institutionalism; because of this middle ground it has been widely popular.  Benedict's concerns were the needs of monks in a community environment: namely, to establish due order, to foster an understanding of the relational nature of human beings, and to provide a spiritual father to support and strengthen the individual's ascetic effort and the spiritual growth that is required for the fulfillment of the human vocation, theosis. 

Rheumatoid arthritis<====>25875<====>Rheumatoid arthritis   Rheumatoid arthritis  (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints.   It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints.   Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest.   Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body.   The disease may also affect other parts of the body.   This may result in a low red blood cell count, inflammation around the lungs, and inflammation around the heart.   Fever and low energy may also be present. 

Anastasius I Dicorus<====>25876<====>Anastasius I Dicorus  Anastasius I ( ,  ;   9 July 518) was Eastern Roman Emperor from 491 to 518.  His reign was characterized by substantive accomplishments, which were representative of emerging patterns of government, economy, and bureaucracy in the Eastern Roman empire.In addition, Anastasius I is known for leaving the imperial government with a sizable budget surplus due to minimization of government corruption, reforms to the tax code, and the introduction of a new form of currency.    Background and personal characteristicsAnastasius was born at Dyrrachium, the date is unknown, but he is thought to have been born no later than 430 or 431. 

Anastasios II<====>25877<====>Anastasios II   Anastasius (Greek: Ἀρτέμιος Ἀναστάσιος Β΄), known in English as Anastasios II or Anastasius II (died 719), was the Byzantine Emperor from 713 to 715. BiographyAnastasios was originally named Artemius (Ἀρτέμιος) and had served as a bureaucrat and Imperial secretary (asekretis) for his predecessors.  After the Opsician army in Thrace had overthrown Emperor Philippikos Bardanes (Philippicus), they acclaimed Artemius as Emperor.  He chose Anastasius as his regnal name.  Soon after his accession, Anastasius II imposed discipline on the army and executed those officers who had been directly involved in the conspiracy against Philippikos. Anastasios upheld the decisions of the Sixth Ecumenical Council and deposed the Monothelete Patriarch John VI of Constantinople, replacing him with the orthodox Patriarch Germanus in 715. 

Roman Missal<====>25878<====>Roman Missal The Roman Missal ( ) is the liturgical book that contains the texts and rubrics for the celebration of the Mass in the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church. HistorySituation before the Council of TrentBefore the high Middle Ages, several books were used at Mass: a Sacramentary with the prayers, one or more books for the Scriptural readings, and one or more books for the antiphons and other chants.  Gradually, manuscripts came into being that incorporated parts of more than one of these books, leading finally to versions that were complete in themselves.  Such a book was referred to as a Missale Plenum ( ). 

Roger Bacon<====>25879<====>Roger Bacon    Roger Bacon   ( ;    or  , also   Rogerus;  ), also known by the scholastic accolade Doctor  , was an English philosopher and Franciscan friar who placed considerable emphasis on the study of nature through empiricism.  In the early modern era, he was regarded as a wizard and particularly famed for the story of his mechanical or necromantic brazen head.  He is sometimes credited (mainly since the 19th century) as one of the earliest European advocates of the modern scientific method inspired by Aristotle and by Arab scientist Alhazen. 

Refractive index<====>25880<====>Refractive indexIn optics, the refractive index or index of refraction of a material is a dimensionless number that describes how light propagates through that medium.  It is defined as n = \frac{c}{v}, where c is the speed of light in vacuum and v is the phase velocity of light in the medium.  For example, the refractive index of water is 1. 333, meaning that light travels 1. 333 times slower in water than in the vacuum. The refractive index determines how much the path of light is bent, or refracted, when entering a material.  This is the first documented use of refractive indices and is described by Snell's law of refraction, n 1  sinθ 1  = n 2  sinθ 2 ,where θ 1  and θ 2  are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively, of a ray crossing the interface between two media with refractive indices n 1  and n 2 . 

Roman Kingdom<====>25882<====>Roman KingdomThe Roman Kingdom, or regal period, was the period of the ancient Roman civilization characterized by a monarchical form of government of the city of Rome and its territories. Little is certain about the history of the kingdom, as nearly no written records from that time survive, and the histories about it that were written during the Republic and Empire are largely based on legends.  However, the history of the Roman Kingdom began with the city's founding, traditionally dated to 753 BC with settlements around the Palatine Hill along the river Tiber in Central Italy, and ended with the overthrow of the kings and the establishment of the Republic in about 509 BC. 

Rán<====>25886<====>RánIn Norse mythology, Rán (Old Norse perhaps "robber" Simek (2007:260).  ) is a goddess associated with the sea.  According to Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál, in his retelling of the Poetic Edda poem Lokasenna, she is married to Ægir and they have nine daughters together.  Snorri also reports that she had a net in which she tried to capture men who ventured out on the sea: "Ran is the name of Ægir's wife, and their daughters are nine, even as we have written before.  At this feast all things were self-served, both food and ale, and all implements needful to the feast. 

Roxy Music<====>25892<====>Roxy Music    Roxy Music  were   an English rock band formed in 1971 by Bryan Ferry, who became the band's lead vocalist and chief songwriter, and bassist Graham Simpson.  Alongside Ferry, the other longtime members were Phil Manzanera (guitar), Andy Mackay (saxophone and oboe) and Paul Thompson (drums and percussion), and other former members include Brian Eno (synthesizer and "treatments"), Eddie Jobson (synthesiser and violin), and John Gustafson (bass).  Although the band took a break from group activities in 1976 and again in 1983, they reunited for a concert tour in 2001, and toured together intermittently between that time and their break-up in 2011. 

Robert Fripp<====>25893<====>Robert Fripp   Robert Fripp (born 16 May 1946) is an English guitarist, composer and record producer.  As a guitarist for the progressive rock band King Crimson, Fripp has been the only member to have played in all of King Crimson's line-ups from their inception in the late 1960s to the present.  He has also worked extensively as a studio musician, notably with singer David Bowie on the albums "Heroes" and Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps), Brian Eno, David Sylvian and contributed sounds to the Windows Vista operating system.    His complete discography lists more than seven hundred releases over four decades. 

Robert Zubrin<====>25894<====>Robert Zubrin  Robert Zubrin (born April 9, 1952) is an American aerospace engineer and author, best known for his advocacy of the manned exploration of Mars.  He and his colleague at Martin Marietta, David Baker, were the driving force behind Mars Direct, a proposal intended to produce significant reductions in the cost and complexity of such a mission.  The key idea was to use the Martian atmosphere to produce oxygen, water, and rocket propellant for the surface stay and return journey.   A modified version of the plan was subsequently adopted by NASA as their "design reference mission". 

Road<====>25897<====>Road   A road is a thoroughfare, route, or way on land between two places that has been paved or otherwise improved to allow travel by foot or some form of  , including a motor vehicle, cart, bicycle, or horse. Roads consist of one or two roadways (British English: carriageways), each with one or more lanes and any associated sidewalks (British English: pavement) and road verges.  In the Netherlands there is often a Protected Bicycle Path provided for cycling. Roads available for use by the public may be referred to as parkways, avenues, freeways, interstates, highways, or primary, secondary, and tertiary local roads. 

Roman roads<====>25898<====>Roman roads Roman roads[Latin]: viae Romanae; singular: Via Romana meaning Roman way) were physical infrastructure vital to the maintenance and development of the Roman state, and were built from about 300 BC through the expansion and consolidation of the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire.   They provided efficient means for the overland movement of armies, officials, and civilians, and the inland carriage of official communications and trade goods.   Roman roads were of several kinds, ranging from small local roads to broad, long-distance highways built to connect cities, major towns and military bases.  These major roads were often stone-paved and metaled, cambered for drainage, and were flanked by footpaths, bridleways and drainage ditches. 

Roberto Clemente<====>25901<====>Roberto Clemente  Roberto Enrique Clemente Walker  ( ; August 18, 1934 – December 31, 1972) was a Puerto Rican professional baseball right fielder who played 18 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates.  He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1973, becoming the first Latin American and Caribbean player to be enshrined.  His untimely death established the precedent that, as an alternative to the five-year retirement period, a player who has been deceased for at least six months is eligible for entry into the Hall of Fame. Clemente was an All-Star for twelve seasons, playing in fifteen All-Star Games. 

Range voting<====>25908<====>Range voting Range voting or score voting   is an electoral system for single-seat elections, in which voters give each candidate a score, the scores are added (or, equivalently, averaged),   and the candidate with the highest total is elected.  It has been described by various other names including evaluative voting,    utilitarian voting,  the point system, ratings summation, 0-99 voting, average voting, and utility voting.   It is a type of cardinal voting electoral system. UsageA crude form of range voting   was apparently used in some elections in Ancient Sparta, by measuring how loudly the crowd shouted for different candidates. 

The Ren & Stimpy Show<====>25912<====>The Ren & Stimpy Show  The Ren & Stimpy Show is an American animated series created by John Kricfalusi for Nickelodeon.  The series follows the adventures of title characters Ren, an emotionally unstable chihuahua, and Stimpy, a good-natured, dimwitted cat.  It premiered on August 11, 1991 as one of the original three Nicktoons, along with Rugrats and Doug.  Throughout its run, the show was controversial for its off-color humor, sexual innuendo, dark humor, adult jokes, and violence.  This controversy contributed to the production staff's altercations with Nickelodeon's Standards and Practices department.  The show ended on December 16, 1995, with a total of five seasons and 52 episodes. 

R-Type<====>25913<====>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot-em-up arcade game produced by Irem in 1987.  The player controls a space fighter named the R-9 to defend humanity against a mysterious powerful alien life-form known as the "Bydo". Being one of Irem's most well-known video games, R-Type was ported to various home platforms, and several of its versions including the arcade original have since been re-released on more contemporary consoles.  Both the arcade game and the ports were well received by video game magazines.  It has spawned a series of sequels by Irem and inspired several video games from other companies. 

Reinhard Heydrich<====>25914<====>Reinhard HeydrichReinhard Tristan Eugen Heydrich ( ; 7 March 1904 – 4 June 1942) was a high-ranking German Nazi official during World War II, and a main architect of the Holocaust.  He was an SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Polizei (Senior Group Leader and General of Police) as well as chief of the Reich Main Security Office (including the Gestapo, Kripo, and SD).  He was also Stellvertretender Reichsprotektor (Deputy/Acting Reich-Protector) of Bohemia and Moravia.  Heydrich served as president of the International Criminal Police Commission (ICPC; later known as Interpol) and chaired the January 1942 Wannsee Conference, which formalised plans for the Final Solution to the Jewish Question—the deportation and genocide of all Jews in German-occupied Europe. 

Raëlism<====>25915<====>Raëlism   Raëlism (also known as Raëlianism or the Raëlian movement) is a UFO religion that was founded in 1974 by Claude Vorilhon (b.  1946), now known as Raël.  The Raëlian Movement teaches that life on Earth was scientifically created by a species of extraterrestrials, which they call the Elohim.  Members of this species appeared human when having personal contacts with the descendants of the humans that they made.  They purposefully misinformed early humanity that they were angels, cherubim, or gods.  Raëlians believe that messengers, or prophets, of the Elohim include Buddha, Jesus, and others Nickerson, Colin, CANADIAN CULT SAYS FIRST HUMAN CLONE IS NEAR BIRTH, Boston Globe. 

Romantic music<====>25916<====>Romantic music   Romantic music is a period of Western classical music that began in the late 18th or early 19th century.  It is related to Romanticism, the European artistic and literary movement that arose in the second half of the 18th century, and Romantic music in particular dominated the Romantic movement in Germany. In the Romantic period, music became more expressive and emotional, expanding to encompass literary, artistic, and philosophical themes.  Famous early Romantic composers include Beethoven (whose works span both this period and the preceding Classical period), Schubert, Schumann, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Bellini, and Berlioz.  The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra and in the dynamic range and diversity of instruments used in this ensemble. 

Race game (paper and pencil game)<====>25917<====>Race game (paper and pencil game) Race Game is a pencil and paper game, involving the pencil flick action. On a sheet of paper, draw the outline of a circle or oval.  It does not have to be perfectly circular, and some unevenness can improve the game.  Now draw another circle or oval inside that, more or less concentric with gap of one or two centimetres between the two.  This produces a loop of "track". Now draw a line anywhere across the two lines.  This is the starting marker.  A player starts by putting the point of a pen (or pencil) on the starting marker, placing their palm on top of it, and pushing it only using the palm of their hand. 

Rapids<====>25919<====>Rapids  Rapids are sections of a river where the river bed has a relatively steep slope.  Its intensity ranges from a scale of 1-8, with 1 being the most navigable and 8 being the least gradient, causing an increase in water velocity and turbulence. Rapids are hydrological features between a run (a smoothly flowing part of a stream) and a cascade.  Rapids are characterised by the river becoming shallower with some rocks exposed above the flow surface.  As flowing water splashes over and around the rocks, air bubbles become mixed in with it and portions of the surface acquire a white colour, forming what is called "whitewater". 

Rutherfordium<====>25927<====>Rutherfordium Rutherfordium is a synthetic chemical element with symbol Rf and atomic number 104, named after physicist Ernest Rutherford.  As a synthetic element, it is not found in nature and can only be created in a laboratory.  It is radioactive; the most stable known isotope,  267 Rf, has a half-life of approximately 1. 3 hours. In the periodic table of the elements, it is a d-block element and the second of the fourth-row transition elements.  It is a member of the 7th period and belongs to the group 4 elements.  Chemistry experiments have confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as the heavier homologue to hafnium in group 4. 

Regiomontanus<====>25929<====>Regiomontanus  Johannes Müller von Königsberg (6 June 1436 – 6 July 1476), better known as Regiomontanus, was a  mathematician and astronomer of the German Renaissance, active in Vienna, Buda and Nuremberg.  His contributions were instrumental in the development of Copernican heliocentrism in the decades following his death. Regiomontanus wrote under the Latinized name of Ioannes de Monteregio (or Monte Regio;  Regio Monte); the adjectival Regiomontanus was first used by Philipp Melanchthon in 1534.  He is named for Königsberg in Lower Franconia, not after the larger  Königsberg (modern Kaliningrad) in Prussia. Life At eleven years of age, Regiomontanus became a student at the University of Leipzig, Saxony. 

Two-round system<====>25932<====>Two-round system  The two-round system (also known as the second ballot, runoff voting or ballotage) is a voting method used to elect a single winner, where the voter casts a single vote for their chosen candidate.  However, if no candidate receives the required number of votes, then those candidates having less than a certain proportion of the votes, or all but the two candidates receiving the most votes, are eliminated, and a second round of voting is held. The two-round system is used around the world for the election of legislative bodies and directly elected presidents.  For example, it is used in French presidential, legislative, and departmental elections.

Rudy Giuliani<====>25938<====>Rudy Giuliani   Rudolph William Louis Giuliani    ( ; born May 28, 1944) is an American lawyer, businessman, public speaker, former mayor of New York City, and an informal adviser on cybersecurity to the White House.  Politically a Democrat, then an Independent in the 1970s, and a Republican since the 1980s, Giuliani was the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York during the 1980s.  Giuliani prosecuted pivotal cases against the American Mafia, and against corrupt corporate financiers. During his first term as mayor of New York City, Giuliani hired a new police commissioner, William Bratton, who applied the broken windows theory of urban decay, which holds that minor disorders and violations create a permissive atmosphere that leads to further and more serious crimes that can threaten the safety of a city. 

Renaissance dance<====>25944<====>Renaissance dance Renaissance dances belong to the broad group of historical dances. OverviewDuring the Renaissance period, there was a distinction between country dances and court dances.  Court dances required the dancers to be trained and were often for display and entertainment, whereas country dances could be attempted by anyone.  At Court, the formal entertainment would often be followed by many hours of country dances which all present could join in.  Dances described as country dances such as Chiarantana or Chiaranzana remained popular over a long period - over two centuries in the case of this dance.  A Renaissance dance can be likened to a ball. 

Rem Koolhaas<====>25945<====>Rem Koolhaas  Remment Lucas "Rem" Koolhaas ( ; born 17 November 1944) is a Dutch architect, architectural theorist, urbanist and Professor in Practice of Architecture and Urban Design at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University.  Koolhaas studied at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London and at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.  Koolhaas is the founding partner of OMA, and of its research-oriented counterpart AMO based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.  In 2005, he co-founded Volume Magazine together with Mark Wigley and Ole Bouman. He is widely regarded as one of the most important architectural thinkers and urbanists of his generation.

His notable buildings include the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris (with Richard Rogers, 1977), The Shard in London (2012), and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City (2015).  He won the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1998. Early life and first buildingsPiano was born in Genoa, Italy,  into a family of builders.  His grandfather had created a masonry enterprise, which had been expanded by his father, Carlo Piano, and his father's three brothers, into the firm Fratelli Piano. 

Refraction<====>25948<====>Refraction    Refraction is the change in direction of wave propagation due to a change in its transmission medium. The phenomenon is explained by the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum.  Owing to the change of medium, the phase velocity of the wave is changed but its frequency remains constant.  This is most commonly observed when a wave passes from one medium to another at any angle other than 0° from the normal.  Refraction of light is the most commonly observed phenomenon, but any type of wave can refract when it interacts with a medium, for example when sound waves pass from one medium into another or when water waves move into water of a different depth. 

Recreational drug use<====>25949<====>Recreational drug use  Recreational drug use is the use of a psychoactive drug to induce an altered state of consciousness for pleasure, by modifying the perceptions, feelings, and emotions of the user.  When a psychoactive drug enters the user's body, it induces an intoxicating effect.  Generally, recreational drugs are in three categories: depressants  (drugs that induce a feeling of relaxation and calm); stimulants (drugs that induce a sense of energy and alertness); and hallucinogens (drugs that induce perceptual distortions such as hallucination).  In popular practice, recreational drug use generally is a tolerated social behaviour, rather than perceived as the serious medical condition of self-medication. 

Robert Frost<====>25951<====>Robert Frost   Robert Lee Frost (March 26, 1874 January 29, 1963) was an American poet.  His work was initially published in England before it was published in America.  Known for his realistic depictions of rural life and his command of American colloquial speech,    Frost frequently wrote about settings from rural life in New England in the early twentieth century, using them to examine complex social and philosophical themes.  Frost was honored frequently during his lifetime, receiving four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry.  He became one of America's rare "public literary figures, almost an artistic institution. 

Rotary dial<====>25960<====>Rotary dial A rotary dial is a component of a telephone or a telephone switchboard that implements a signaling technology in telecommunications known as pulse dialing.  It is used when initiating a telephone call to transmit the destination telephone number to a telephone exchange. On the rotary dial, the digits are arranged in a circular layout so that a finger wheel may be rotated with one finger from the position of each digit to a fixed stop position, implemented by the finger stop, which is a mechanical barrier to prevent further rotation. When released at the finger stop, the wheel returns to its home position by spring action at a speed regulated by a governor device. 

Revolution<====>25964<====>Revolution   A revolution (from the Latin revolutio, "a turn around") is a fundamental change in political power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time when the population rises up in revolt against the current authorities. Aristotle described two types of political revolution:Complete change from one constitution to anotherModification of an existing constitution.  Revolutions have occurred through human history and vary widely in terms of methods, duration, and motivating ideology.  Their results include major changes in culture, economy, and socio-political institutions, usually in response to overwhelming autocracy or plutocracy. Scholarly debates about what does and does not constitute a revolution center on several issues. 

Roland TB-303<====>25969<====>Roland TB-303 The Roland TB-303 Bass Line is a bass synthesizer with built-in sequencer manufactured by the Roland Corporation.  The TB-303 is a monophonic synthesizer, which means that it can only play one note at a time; it is monotimbral; it uses a sawtooth and square wave oscillator; and it has a 24dB low pass resonant filter.  The TB-303 is used by DJs and record producers to perform and program basslines, as well as other rhythmic/melodic synthesizer motifs.  Released from 1981  to 1984, it had a defining role in the development of contemporary electronic dance music. 

RCA<====>25970<====>RCA   The RCA Corporation was a major American electronics company, which was founded as the Radio Corporation of America in 1919.  It was initially a wholly owned subsidiary of General Electric (GE); however, in 1932, GE was required to divest its control as part of the settlement of an antitrust suit. At its height as an independent company, RCA was the dominant communications firm in the United States.  Beginning in the early 1920s, RCA was a major manufacturer of radio receivers, and also developed the first national radio network, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC).  It had a leading role in the introduction of black-and-white television in the 1940s and 1950s, and color television in the 1950s and 1960s. 

Rubik's Cube<====>25971<====>Rubik's Cube  Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle invented in 1974  by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ernő Rubik.  Originally called the Magic Cube,  the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by Ideal Toy Corp.  in 1980    via businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer,  and won the German Game of the Year special award for Best Puzzle that year.   , 350 million cubes had been sold worldwide   making it the world's top-selling puzzle game.    It is widely considered to be the world's best-selling toy. 

Red Army Faction<====>25973<====>Red Army Faction    The Red Army Faction (RAF; German:  ), See the section Faction versus Fraktion  referred to by the government and corporate media as the Baader-Meinhof Group or Baader-Meinhof Gang ( ), was a West German far-left militant organization.  The RAF was founded in 1970.  Key early figures included Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, Horst Mahler and Ulrike Meinhof, among others.   The West German government considered the Red Army Faction to be a terrorist organization.  "June 24, 1976 The West German parliament passes legislation integrating §129a.  which criminalizes 'supporting or participating in a terrorist organization,' into the Basic Law. 

Radiosity (computer graphics)<====>25974<====>Radiosity (computer graphics) In 3D computer graphics, radiosity is an application of the finite element method to solving the rendering equation for scenes with surfaces that reflect light diffusely.   Unlike rendering methods that use Monte Carlo algorithms (such as path tracing), which handle all types of light paths, typical radiosity only account for paths (represented by the code "LD*E") which leave a light source and are reflected diffusely some number of times (possibly zero) before hitting the eye.  Radiosity is a global illumination algorithm in the sense that the illumination arriving on a surface comes not just directly from the light sources, but also from other surfaces reflecting light. 

Reign of Terror<====>25975<====>Reign of Terror   The  Reign of Terror or The Terror ( ) is the label given by some historians to a period during the French Revolution after the First French Republic was established.Several historians consider the "reign of terror" to have begun in 1793, placing the starting date at either 5 September,    June   or March (birth of the Revolutionary Tribunal), while some consider it to have begun in September 1792 (September Massacres), or even July 1789 (when the first beheadings took place), The dates July 1789, September 1792, March 1793 as starting date for the Reign of Terror ( ) are given in the French Wikipedia, referring to source: Jean-Clément Martin, La Terreur, part maudite de la Révolution ('The Terror, the cursed part of the Revolution'), coll. Découvertes Gallimard (n° 566), Paris: Gallimard, 2010, p. 14–15.  but there is a general consensus that it ended with the fall of Robespierre in July 1794.  Between June 1793 and the end of July 1794, there were 16,594 official death sentences in France, of which 2,639 were in Paris.    Barère and Robespierre glorify "terror"  There was a sense of emergency among leading politicians in France in the summer of 1793 between the widespread civil war and counter-revolution.  Mr. Barère exclaimed on 5 September 1793 in the Convention: "Let's make terror the order of the day!"   They were determined to avoid street violence such as the September Massacres of 1792 by taking violence into their own hands as an instrument of government.   Robespierre in February 1794 in a speech explained the necessity of terror: Some historians argue that such terror was a necessary reaction to the circumstances.  Others suggest there were also other causes, including ideological  and emotional. Major events during 'the terror'   On 10 March 1793 the National Convention created the Revolutionary Tribunal. Among those charged by the tribunal, about a half were acquitted (though the number dropped to about a quarter after the enactment of the Law of 22 Prairial). In March rebellion broke out in the Vendée in response to mass conscription, which developed into a civil war that lasted until after the Terror.On 6 April the Committee of Public Safety was created, which gradually became the de facto war-time government.On 2 June, the Parisian sans-culottes surrounded the National Convention, calling for administrative and political purges, a low fixed price for bread, and a limitation of the electoral franchise to sans-culottes alone. With the backing of the national guard, they persuaded the convention to arrest 29 Girondist leaders.  In reaction to the imprisonment of the Girondin deputies, some thirteen departments started the Federalist revolt against the National Convention in Paris, which was ultimately crushed. On 24 June, the convention adopted the first republican constitution of France, the French Constitution of 1793. It was ratified by public referendum, but never put into force.On 13 July the assassination of Jean-Paul Marat – a Jacobin leader and journalist – resulted in a further increase in Jacobin political influence. Georges Danton, the leader of the August 1792 uprising against the king, was removed from the committee. On July 27, 1793, Robespierre became part of the Committee of Public Safety.  On 23 August, the National Convention decreed the Levée en masse, "The young men shall fight; the married man shall forge arms and transport provisions; the women shall make tents and clothes and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall turn all lint into linen; the old men shall betake themselves to the public square in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic."On 9 September, the convention established paramilitary forces, the "revolutionary armies", to force farmers to surrender grain demanded by the government. On 17 September, the Law of Suspects was passed, which authorized the imprisonment of vaguely defined "suspects". This created a mass overflow in the prison systems. On 29 September, the convention extended price fixing from grain and bread to other essential goods, and also fixed wages.On 10 October, the Convention decreed that "the provisional government shall be revolutionary until peace." On 24 October, the French Republican Calendar was enacted. The trial of the Girondins started on the same day and they were executed on 31 October. Anti-clerical sentiments increased during 1793 and a campaign of dechristianization occurred. On 10 November (20 Brumaire Year II of the French Republican Calendar), the Hébertists organized a Festival of Reason.On 14 Frimaire (5 December 1793) was passed the Law of Frimaire, which gave the central government more control over the actions of the representatives on mission.On 16 Pluviôse (4 February 1794), the National Convention decreed that slavery be abolished in all of France and French colonies.On 8 and 13 Ventôse (26 February and 3 March), Saint-Just proposed decrees to confiscate the property of exiles and opponents of the revolution, known as the Ventôse Decrees.By the end of 1793, two major factions had emerged, both threatening the Revolutionary Government: the Hébertists, who called for an intensification of the Terror and threatened insurrection, and the Dantonists, led by Georges Danton, who demanded moderation and clemency. The Committee of Public Safety took actions against both. The major Hébertists were tried before the Revolutionary Tribunal and executed on 24 March. The Dantonists were arrested on 30 March, tried on 3 to 5 April and executed on 5 April.On 20 Prairial (8 June) was celebrated across the country the Festival of the Supreme Being, which was part of the Cult of the Supreme Being, a deist national religion. On 22 Prairial (10 June), the National Convention passed a law proposed by Georges Couthon, known as the Law of 22 Prairial, which simplified the judicial process and greatly accelerated the work of the Revolutionary Tribunal. With the enactment of the law, the number of executions greatly increased, and the period from this time to the Thermidorian Reaction became known as "The Grand Terror".On 8 Messidor (26 June), the French army won the Battle of Fleurus, which marked a turning point in France's military campaign and undermined the necessity of wartime measures and the legitimacy of the Revolutionary Government.Thermidorian Reaction The fall of Robespierre was brought about by a combination of those who wanted more power for the Committee of Public Safety (and a more radical policy than he was willing to allow) and the moderates who completely opposed the revolutionary government. They had, between them, made the Law of 22 Prairial one of the charges against him, so that, after his fall, to advocate terror would be seen as adopting the policy of a convicted enemy of the republic, putting the advocate's own head at risk. Between his arrest and his execution, Robespierre may have tried to commit suicide by shooting himself, although the bullet wound he sustained, whatever its origin, only shattered his jaw. Alternatively, he may have been shot by the gendarme Merda. The great confusion that arose during the storming of the municipal Hall of Paris, where Robespierre and his friends had found refuge, make it impossible to be sure of the wound's origin.In any case, Robespierre was guillotined the next day. The reign of the standing Committee of Public Safety was ended. New members were appointed the day after Robespierre's execution, and limits on terms of office were fixed (a quarter of the committee retired every three months). The Committee's powers were gradually eroded. See alsoBals des victimesTricoteuseDrownings at NantesState terrorismReferences Further readingPrimary sources Secondary sources Baker,  Keith M.

Reliabilism<====>25976<====>ReliabilismReliabilism, a category of theories in the philosophical discipline of epistemology, has been advanced as a theory both of justification and of knowledge.  Process reliabilism has been used as an argument against philosophical skepticism, such as the brain in a vat thought experiment.    Process reliabilism is a form of epistemic externalism.  A broadly reliabilist theory of knowledge is roughly as follows:Reliabilism breaks into four branches.  Firstly, Process Reliabilism focuses on the contribution of the truth, mainly the process of producing reliable or certain belief.  Secondly, Virtue Reliabilism focuses on the agent’s believing performance and the agent’s rational traits. 

Ideal (ring theory)<====>25977<====>Ideal (ring theory) In ring theory, a branch of abstract algebra, an ideal is a special subset of a ring.  Ideals generalize certain subsets of the integers, such as the even numbers or the multiples of 3.  Addition and subtraction of even numbers preserves evenness, and multiplying an even number by any other integer results in another even number;  these closure and absorption properties are the defining properties of an ideal.   An ideal can be used to construct a quotient ring similarly to the way that, in group theory, a normal subgroup can be used to construct a quotient group. 

Reversi<====>25978<====>Reversi   Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8×8 uncheckered board.  There are sixty-four identical game pieces called disks (often spelled "discs"), which are light on one side and dark on the other.   Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up.  During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color. The object of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display your color when the last playable empty square is filled. 

Radix sort<====>25980<====>Radix sort In computer science, radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by the individual digits which share the same significant position and value.   A positional notation is required, but because integers can represent strings of characters (e. g. , names or dates) and specially formatted floating point numbers, radix sort is not limited to integers.   Radix sort dates back as far as 1887 to the work of Herman Hollerith on tabulating machines.  Most digital computers internally represent all of their data as electronic representations of binary numbers, so processing the digits of integer representations by groups of binary digit representations is most convenient. 

Tug of war<====>25982<====>Tug of war  Tug of war (also known as  war of tug, tug o' war, tug war, rope war, rope pulling, tug rope, tugging war or  ) is a sport that directly puts two teams against each other in a test of strength: teams pull on opposite ends of a rope, with the goal being to bring the rope a certain distance in one direction against the force of the opposing team's pull. TerminologyThe Oxford English Dictionary says that the phrase "tug of war" originally meant "the decisive contest; the real struggle or tussle; a severe contest for supremacy". 

Regular semantics<====>25983<====>Regular semanticsRegular semantics is a computing term which describes one type of guarantee provided by a data register shared by several processors in a parallel machine or in a network of computers working together.  Regular semantics are defined for a variable with a single writer but multiple readers.  These semantics are stronger than safe semantics but weaker than atomic semantics: they guarantee that there is a total order to the write operations which is consistent with real-time and that read operations return either the value of the last write completed before the read begins, or that of one of the writes which are concurrent with the read. 

Ray Kurzweil<====>25984<====>Ray Kurzweil Raymond "Ray" Kurzweil (   ; born February 12, 1948) is an American author, computer scientist, inventor and futurist.  Aside from futurism, he is involved in fields such as optical character recognition (OCR), text-to-speech synthesis, speech recognition technology, and electronic keyboard instruments.  He has written books on health, artificial intelligence (AI), transhumanism, the technological singularity, and futurism.  Kurzweil is a public advocate for the futurist and transhumanist movements, and gives public talks to share his optimistic outlook on life extension technologies and the future of nanotechnology, robotics, and biotechnology. Kurzweil was the principal inventor of the first charge-coupled device flatbed scanner,    the first omni-font optical character recognition,  the first print-to-speech reading machine for the blind,  the first commercial text-to-speech synthesizer,  the Kurzweil K250 music synthesizer capable of simulating the sound of the grand piano and other orchestral instruments, and the first commercially marketed large-vocabulary speech recognition. 

Rutherford scattering<====>25985<====>Rutherford scatteringRutherford scattering is the elastic scattering of charged particles by the Coulomb interaction.   It is a physical phenomenon explained by Ernest Rutherford in 1911  that led to the development of the planetary Rutherford model of the atom and eventually the Bohr model.   Rutherford scattering was first referred to as Coulomb scattering because it relies only upon the static electric (Coulomb) potential, and the minimal distance between particles is set entirely by this potential.  The classical Rutherford scattering process of alpha particles against gold nuclei is an example of "elastic scattering" because neither the alpha particles nor the gold nuclei are internally excited.

Rickets<====>25987<====>Rickets   Rickets is a condition that results in weak or soft bones in children.Symptoms include bowed legs, stunted growth, bone pain, large forehead, and trouble sleeping.    Complications may include bone fractures, muscle spasms, an abnormally curved spine, or intellectual disability.    The most common cause is vitamin D deficiency.   This can result from eating a diet without enough vitamin D, dark skin, too little sun exposure, exclusive breastfeeding without vitamin D supplementation, celiac disease, and certain genetic conditions.    Other factors may include not enough calcium or phosphorus. 

RGB color model<====>25989<====>RGB color model The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors.  The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue. The main purpose of the RGB color model is for the sensing, representation and display of images in electronic systems, such as televisions and computers, though it has also been used in conventional photography.  Before the electronic age, the RGB color model already had a solid theory behind it, based in human perception of colors. 

Richard Garfield<====>25991<====>Richard Garfield  Richard Channing Garfield (born June 26, 1963) is an American mathematician, inventor, and game designer.  Garfield created Magic: The Gathering, which is considered to be the first modern collectible card game (CCG).  Magic debuted in 1993, and its success spawned many imitations.   Garfield oversaw the successful growth of Magic and followed it with other game designs.  Varney, Allen.  "Richard Garfield. " The Escapist.  10 JULY 2007.  Retrieved 27 June 2013.   Garfield also designed the CCG Netrunner (basis for the current living card game (LCG) Android: Netrunner ), as well as BattleTech, Vampire: The Eternal Struggle (originally known as Jyhad), Star Wars Trading Card Game, the card game The Great Dalmuti, and the board game RoboRally. 

Roman legion<====>25994<====>Roman legion   A Roman legion (from Latin legio "military levy, conscription", from legere "to choose") was the largest unit of the Roman army, evolving from 3000 men in early times to over 5200 men in imperial times, consisting of centuries as the basic units.  Until the middle of the first century, 10 cohorts (about 5,000 men) made up a Roman Legion.  This was later changed to nine cohorts of standard size (with 6 centuries at 80 men each) and one cohort, the first cohort, of double strength (5 double-strength centuries with 160 men each). In the early Roman Kingdom the "legion" may have meant the entire Roman army but sources on this period are few and unreliable. 

Reciprocating engine<====>25995<====>Reciprocating engineA reciprocating engine, also often known as a piston engine, is typically a heat engine (although there are also pneumatic and hydraulic reciprocating engines) that uses one or more reciprocating pistons to convert pressure into a rotating motion.  This article describes the common features of all types.  The main types are: the internal combustion engine, used extensively in motor vehicles; the steam engine, the mainstay of the Industrial Revolution; and the niche application Stirling engine.  Internal combustion engines are further classified in two ways: either a spark-ignition (SI) engine, where the spark plug initiates the combustion; or a compression-ignition (CI) engine, where the air within the cylinder is compressed, thus heating it, so that the heated air ignites fuel that is injected then or earlier. 

Radical feminism<====>25998<====>Radical feminism   Radical feminism is a perspective within feminism that calls for a radical reordering of society in which male supremacy is eliminated in all social and economic contexts.   Radical feminists seek to abolish patriarchy by challenging existing social norms and institutions.  This includes opposing the sexual objectification of women, raising public awareness about such issues as rape and violence against women, and challenging the very notion of gender roles.  Shulamith Firestone wrote in The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution (1970): "[T]he end goal of feminist revolution must be, unlike that of the first feminist movement, not just the elimination of male privilege but of the sex distinction itself: genital differences between human beings would no longer matter culturally. 

Ray tracing (graphics)<====>26000<====>Ray tracing (graphics) In computer graphics, ray tracing is a rendering technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light as pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects.   The technique is capable of producing a very high degree of visual realism, usually higher than that of typical scanline rendering methods, but at a greater computational cost.  This makes ray tracing best suited for applications where the image can be rendered slowly ahead of time, such as in still images and film and television visual effects, and more poorly suited for real-time applications like video games where speed is critical. 

Ron Carter<====>26002<====>Ron Carter   Ronald Levin "Ron" Carter (born May 4, 1937) is an American jazz double bassist.  His appearances on 2,221 recording sessions make him the most-recorded jazz bassist in history.   Carter is also a cellist who has recorded numerous times on that instrument.  Some of his studio albums as a leader include: Blues Farm (1973); All Blues (1973); Spanish Blue (1974); Anything Goes (1975); Yellow & Green (1976); Pastels (1976); Piccolo (1977); Third Plane (1977); Peg Leg (1978); and A Song for You (1978). He was a member of the Miles Davis Quintet in the early 1960s, which also included Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter and drummer Tony Williams. 

Radian<====>26003<====>Radian    The radian (SI symbol rad) is the SI unit for measuring angles, and is the standard unit of angular measure used in many areas of mathematics.   The length of an arc of a unit circle is numerically equal to the measurement in radians of the angle that it  s; one radian is just under 57. 3 degrees (expansion at  ).  The unit was formerly an SI supplementary unit, but this category was abolished in 1995 and the radian is now considered an SI derived unit.  Separately, the SI unit of solid angle measurement is the steradian. 

Mass racial violence in the United States<====>26007<====>Mass racial violence in the United StatesMass racial violence in the United States, also called race riots, can include such disparate events as:racially based communal conflict involving African Americans that took place following the American Civil War. conflict between Americans and recent European immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries. attacks on Native Americans and Americans over the land. frequent fighting among various ethnic groups in major cities, specifically in the Northeast and Midwest United States throughout the late 19th century and early 20th century.  One example was explored in the stage musical West Side Story and its film adaptation, about ethnic conflict in New York between Puerto Ricans and Italians. 

Robert Johnson<====>26010<====>Robert Johnson   Robert Leroy Johnson (May 8, 1911 August 16, 1938) was an American blues singer-songwriter and musician.  His landmark recordings in 1936 and 1937 display a combination of singing, guitar skills, and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians.  Johnson's shadowy and poorly documented life and death at age 27 have given rise to much legend.  One Faustian myth says that he sold his soul to the devil at a local crossroads of Mississippi highways to achieve success.  As an   performer who played mostly on street corners, in juke joints, and at Saturday night dances, Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime. 

Receptive aphasia<====>26011<====>Receptive aphasia  Wernicke's aphasia, also known as receptive aphasia, sensory aphasia, or posterior aphasia, is a type of aphasia in which individuals have difficulty understanding written and spoken language.Patients with Wernicke's aphasia demonstrate fluent speech, which is characterized by typical speech rate, intact syntactic abilities, and effortless speech output.Writing often reflects speech in that it tends to lack content or meaning.  In most cases, motor deficits (i. e.  hemiparesis) do not occur in individuals with Wernicke's aphasia.Therefore, they may produce a large amount of speech without much meaning. 

Rehoboam<====>26022<====>Rehoboam Rehoboam (pronounced  ;  ;  ;  ) was the fourth king of Israel according to the Hebrew Bible.  He was a son of and the successor to Solomon, and a grandson of David.  In the account of I Kings and II Chronicles, he was initially king of the United Monarchy of Israel, but after the ten northern tribes of Israel rebelled in 932/931 BC to form the independent Kingdom of Israel (Samaria), under the rule of Jeroboam, Rehoboam remained as king of only the Kingdom of Judah, or southern kingdom. Biblical backgroundAccording to the Jewish Encyclopaedia, "Solomon's wisdom and power were not sufficient to prevent the rebellion of several of his border cities. 

RS-232<====>26023<====>RS-232  In telecommunications, RS-232, Recommended Standard 232  is a standard introduced in 1960  for serial communication transmission of data.  It formally defines the signals connecting between a DTE (data terminal equipment) such as a computer terminal, and a DCE (data circuit-terminating equipment or data communication equipment), such as a modem.  The RS-232 standard had been commonly used in computer serial ports.  The standard defines the electrical characteristics and timing of signals, the meaning of signals, and the physical size and pinout of connectors.  The current version of the standard is TIA-232-F Interface Between Data Terminal Equipment and Data Circuit-Terminating Equipment Employing Serial Binary Data Interchange, issued in 1997. 

Running<====>26032<====>Running   Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot.  Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions ).  This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion.

René Magritte<====>26034<====>René Magritte  René François Ghislain Magritte ( ; 21 November 1898 – 15 August 1967) was a Belgian surrealist artist.  He became well known for creating a number of witty and thought-provoking images.  Often depicting ordinary objects in an unusual context, his work is known for challenging observers' preconditioned perceptions of reality.  His imagery has influenced pop, minimalist and conceptual art. Early lifeRené  Magritte was born in Lessines, in the province of Hainaut, Belgium, in 1898.  He was the oldest son of Léopold Magritte, a tailor and textile merchant, Meuris 1991, p 216.   and Régina (née Bertinchamps), who was a milliner before she got married. 

Rudolf Diesel<====>26035<====>Rudolf Diesel  Rudolf Christian Karl Diesel ( ; 18 March 1858 29 September 1913) was a German inventor and mechanical engineer, famous for the invention of the diesel engine, and for his mysterious death.  Diesel was the subject of the 1942 film Diesel. Early life and educationDiesel was born in Paris, France in 1858  the second of three children of Elise (née Strobel) and Theodor Diesel.  His parents were Bavarian immigrants living in Paris.   .    .   Theodor Diesel, a bookbinder by trade, left his home town of Augsburg, Bavaria, in 1848. 

Reform Judaism<====>26036<====>Reform Judaism Reform Judaism (also known as Liberal Judaism or Progressive Judaism) is a major Jewish denomination that emphasizes the evolving nature of the faith, the superiority of its ethical aspects to the ceremonial ones, and a belief in a continuous revelation not centered on the theophany at Mount Sinai.  A liberal strand of Judaism, it is characterized by a lesser stress on ritual and personal observance, regarding Jewish Law as non-binding and the individual Jew as autonomous, and openness to external influences and progressive values.  The origins of Reform Judaism lay in 19th-century Germany, where its early principles were formulated by Rabbi Abraham Geiger and his associates; since the 1970s, the movement adopted a policy of inclusiveness and acceptance, inviting as many as possible to partake in its communities, rather than strict theoretical clarity. 

Reconstructionist Judaism<====>26037<====>Reconstructionist Judaism Reconstructionist Judaism ( , yahadút rekonstruktsyonistit, or  , yahadút mitkhadéshet) is a modern Jewish movement  that views Judaism as a progressively evolving civilization and is based on the conceptions developed by Mordecai Kaplan (1881–1983).  The movement originated as a semi-organized stream within Conservative Judaism and developed from the late 1920s to 1940s, before it seceded in 1955    and established a rabbinical college in 1967.    There is substantial theological diversity within the movement.  Halakha, the collective body of Jewish Law, is not considered binding, but is treated as a valuable cultural remnant that should be upheld unless there is reason for the contrary.

He received three consecutive Grammy Award nominations in the category of Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical for Daft Punk  "End of Line" from the Tron: Legacy movie soundtrack in 2012, Moby  "Lie Down In Darkness" in 2013 and Bob Marley "One Love/People Get Ready" in 2014. 

Homosexuality and religion<====>26040<====>Homosexuality and religion  The relationship between religion and homosexuality has varied greatly across time and place, within and between different religions and denominations, and regarding different forms of homosexuality and bisexuality.  Present day doctrines of the world's major religions vary vastly generally and by denomination on attitudes toward these sexual orientations. Among those denominations that generally are negative towards these orientations, there are many different types of actions they may take: this can range from quietly discouraging homosexual activity, explicitly forbidding same-sex sexual practices among adherents and actively opposing social acceptance of homosexuality, to execution.  Religious fundamentalism has been found to correlate positively with anti-homosexual bias. 

RPGnet<====>26041<====>RPGnet   RPGnet is a role-playing game website.  It includes sections on wargames, tabletop games and video games, as well as columns on gaming topics.  RPGnet was founded in 1996 by Emma and Sandy Antunes, Shawn Althouse (etrigan) and Brian David Phillips, as a way to unify a number of transient game sites.   In 2001 it was purchased by Skotos Tech, but maintains creative and editorial autonomy.  Currently it is being run by Shannon Appelcline of Skotos, and Allan Sugarbaker, who maintain oversight over editorial content, with Skotos managing the site's columns and programming, and Sugarbaker managing the reviews and operations. 

Revelation<====>26042<====>Revelation  In religion and theology, revelation is the revealing or disclosing of some form of truth or knowledge through communication with a deity or other supernatural entity or entities. DescriptionSome religions have religious texts which they view as divinely or supernaturally revealed or inspired.  For instance, Orthodox Jews, Christians and Muslims believe that the Torah was received from Yahweh on biblical Mount Sinai.    Most Christians believe that both the Old Testament and the New Testament were inspired by God.  Muslims believe the Quran was revealed by God to Muhammad word by word through the angel Gabriel (Jibril). 

Rotterdam<====>26049<====>Rotterdam   {{Infobox settlement  }} Rotterdam (  or  ;    ) is a city in the Netherlands, in South Holland within the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt river delta at the North Sea.  Its history goes back to 1270, when a dam was constructed in the Rotte river, after which people settled around it for safety.  In 1340, Rotterdam was granted city rights by the Count of Holland.  A major logistic and economic centre, Rotterdam is Europe's largest port, and has a population of 633,471 ( ), the second-largest in the Netherlands, just behind Amsterdam. 

Ringworld<====>26052<====>Ringworld   Ringworld is a 1970 science fiction novel by Larry Niven, set in his Known Space universe and considered a classic of science fiction literature.  Niven later added four sequels and four prequels.  (The Fleet of Worlds series, co-written with Edward M.  Lerner, provides the four prequels, as well as Fate of Worlds, the final sequel. ) These books tie into numerous other books set in Known Space.   Ringworld won the Nebula Award in 1970,    as well as both the Hugo Award and Locus Award in 1971.    Plot summaryOn planet Earth in 2850 AD, Louis Gridley Wu is celebrating his 200th birthday. 

Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor<====>26054<====>Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor  Rudolf II (18 July 1552 – 20 January 1612) was Holy Roman Emperor (1576–1612), King of Hungary and Croatia (as Rudolf I, 1572–1608), King of Bohemia (1575–1608/1611) and Archduke of Austria (1576–1608).  He was a member of the House of Habsburg. Rudolf's legacy has traditionally been viewed in three ways: Hotson, 1999.   an ineffectual ruler whose mistakes led directly to the Thirty Years' War; a great and influential patron of Northern Mannerist art; and an intellectual devotee of occult arts and learning which helped seed what would be called the scientific revolution.

Robert Anton Wilson<====>26056<====>Robert Anton Wilson   Robert Anton Wilson (born Robert Edward Wilson; January 18, 1932 – January 11, 2007) was an American author, novelist, essayist, editor, playwright, poet, futurist, and self-described agnostic mystic.  Recognized as an Episkopos, Pope, and saint of Discordianism, Wilson helped publicize the group through his writings and interviews. Wilson described his work as an "attempt to break down conditioned associations, to look at the world in a new way, with many models recognized as models or maps, and no one model elevated to the truth".   His goal being "to try to get people into a state of generalized agnosticism, not agnosticism about God alone but agnosticism about everything. 

Roller hockey<====>26059<====>Roller hockey Roller hockey is a form of hockey played on a dry surface using wheeled skates.   Most professional-inline hockey games take place on an indoor or outdoor sport court (a type of plastic interlinking tiles used to create a skating surface).   Otherwise, any dry surface can be used to host a game, typically a roller rink, macadam, or cement.   The term "Roller Hockey" is often used interchangeably to refer to two variant forms chiefly differentiated by the type of skates and sticks used.  There is traditional "Roller hockey" (Quad hockey, Rink hockey), played with quad skates, and "Inline hockey", played with inline skates. 

Royal Navy<====>26061<====>Royal NavyThe Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force.  Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the Kingdom of France.  The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service. From the middle decades of the 17th century, and through the 18th century, the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy.

Roof<====>26118<====>Roof    A roof is part of a building envelope.  It is the covering on the uppermost part of a building or shelter which provides protection from animals and weather, notably rain or snow, but also heat, wind and sunlight.  The word also denotes the framing or structure which supports that covering.  The characteristics of a roof are dependent upon the purpose of the building that it covers, the available roofing materials and the local traditions of construction and wider concepts of architectural design and practice and may also be governed by local or national legislation. 

Podocarpus latifolius<====>26119<====>Podocarpus latifolius  Podocarpus latifolius (broad-leaved yellowwood or real yellowwood,  ,  ,  ,  )    is a large evergreen tree up to 35 m high and 3 m trunk diameter, in the conifer family Podocarpaceae; it is the type species of the genus Podocarpus. The real yellowwood has been declared the national tree of South Africa and is protected there.  AppearanceThe real yellowwood is a large evergreen tree that grows up to 30 meters in height.  It grows relatively slowly but forms a wood of exceptional quality. The leaves are strap-shaped, 25–40 mm long on mature trees, larger, to 100 mm long, on vigorous young trees, and 6–12 mm broad, with a bluntly pointed tip. 

Robben Island<====>26122<====>Robben Island   Robben Island ( ) is an island in Table Bay,   west of the coast of Bloubergstrand, Cape Town, South Africa.  The name is Dutch for "seal island. " Robben Island is roughly oval in shape,   long north-south, and   wide, with an area of  .   It is flat and only a few metres above sea level, as a result of an ancient erosion event.  Nobel Laureate and former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela was imprisoned there for 18 of the 27 years he served behind bars before the fall of apartheid. 

Real-time operating system<====>26123<====>Real-time operating systemA real-time operating system (RTOS) is an operating system (OS) intended to serve real-time applications that process data as it comes in, typically without buffer delays.   Processing time requirements (including any OS delay) are measured in tenths of seconds or shorter increments of time. A real time system is a time bound system which has well defined fixed time constraints.  Processing must be done within the defined constraints or the system will fail.   They either are event driven or time sharing.  Event driven systems switch between tasks based on their priorities while time sharing systems switch the task based on clock interrupts. 

The Righteous Brothers<====>26127<====>The Righteous Brothers The Righteous Brothers is an American musical duo of Bill Medley and (formerly) Bobby Hatfield.  They began performing together in 1962 in the Los Angeles area as part of a five-member group called The Paramours,  but adopted the name "The Righteous Brothers" when they embarked on their recording career as a duo.   Their most active recording period was in the 1960s and 70s, and although the duo was inactive for some years, Hatfield and Medley reunited in 1981 and continued to perform until Hatfield's death in 2003.   Their emotive vocal style is sometimes dubbed "blue-eyed soul".

Gandhi was a scion of the politically powerful Nehru–Gandhi family, which had been associated with the Indian National Congress party.  For much of his childhood, his maternal grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru was Prime Minister.  Gandhi attended college in the United Kingdom. 

Racial profiling<====>26131<====>Racial profiling   Racial profiling is the act of suspecting or targeting a person of a certain race based on a stereotype about their race, rather than on individual suspicion. More commonly in the United States, racial profiling is referred to regarding its use by law enforcement at the local, state, and federal levels, and its use leading to discrimination against people in the African American, Asian, Latino, South Asian, Arab, and Muslim communities of the U. S.    In European countries, the term "ethnic profiling" is also used instead of racial profiling. 

Rankine scale<====>26132<====>Rankine scale   The Rankine scale ( ) is an absolute scale of thermodynamic temperature named after the Glasgow University engineer and physicist William John Macquorn Rankine, who proposed it in 1859.  (The Kelvin scale was first proposed in 1848. )   It may be used in engineering systems where heat computations are done using degrees Fahrenheit. The symbol for degrees Rankine is °R  (or °Ra if necessary to distinguish it from the Rømer and Réaumur scales).  By analogy with kelvin, some authors term the unit rankine, omitting the degree symbol.   Zero on both the Kelvin and Rankine scales is absolute zero, but a temperature difference of one Rankine degree is defined as equal to one Fahrenheit degree, rather than the Celsius degree used on the Kelvin scale. 

Rabbinical Assembly<====>26137<====>Rabbinical AssemblyThe Rabbinical Assembly (RA) is the international association of Conservative rabbis.  Rabbinical Assembly – About Us  The RA was founded in 1901 to shape the ideology, programs, and practices of the Conservative movement.   It publishes prayerbooks and books of Jewish interest, and oversees the work of the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards for the Conservative movement.  It organizes conferences and coordinates the Joint Placement Commission of the Conservative movement.  Members of the RA serve as rabbis, educators, community workers and military and hospital chaplains around the world. Rabbis ordained by Jewish Theological Seminary of America, the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies at the  American Jewish University (California), The Seminario Rabínico Latinoamericano (Buenos Aires, Argentina) and The Schechter Rabbinical Seminary (Jerusalem, Israel) automatically become members of the RA upon their ordination. 

Retroposon<====>26139<====>RetroposonRetroposons are repetitive DNA fragments which are inserted into chromosomes after they had been reverse transcribed from any RNA molecule. Difference Between Retroposons And RetrotransposonsIn contrast to retrotransposons, they never encode reverse transcriptase (RT) (but see below).  Therefore, they are non-autonomous elements with regard to transposition activity (as opposed to transposons). Non-long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons such as the human LINE1 elements are sometimes falsely referred to as retroposons.  However, this depends on the author.  For example, Howard Temin published the following definition: Retroposons encode RT but are devoid of long terminal repeats (LTRs), for example Long interspersed elements (LINEs). 

Outline of religion<====>26147<====>Outline of religion  The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to religion:Religion – organized collection of beliefs, cultural systems, and world views that relate humanity to an order of existence. Many religions have narratives, symbols, and sacred histories that are intended to explain the meaning of life and/or to explain the origin of life or the Universe. From their beliefs about the cosmos and human nature, people derive morality, ethics, religious laws or a preferred lifestyle. According to some estimates, there are roughly 4,200 religions in the world.

Raven<====>26151<====>Raven A raven is one of several larger-bodied species of the genus Corvus.  These species do not form a single taxonomic group within the genus. There is no consistent distinction between "crows" and "ravens", and these appellations have been assigned to different species chiefly on the basis of their size, crows generally being smaller than ravens.  The largest raven species are the common raven and the thick-billed raven. EtymologyThe term "raven" originally referred to the common raven, the type species of the genus Corvus, which has a larger distribution than any other species of Corvus, ranging over much of the Northern Hemisphere. 

Romani people<====>26152<====>Romani people   The Romani (also spelled Romany;  ,  ), or Roma, are a traditionally itinerant ethnic group, living mostly in Europe and the Americas and originating from the northern Indian subcontinent,   from the Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and Sindh regions of modern-day India and Pakistan.    A recent DNA study conducted by Indian and Estonian research facilities shows that the Roman/Romani/Gypsy and Sinti people originate from the Untouchable Dalit community from India.  The Romani are widely known among English-speaking people by the exonym Gypsies (or Gipsies), which some people consider pejorative due to its connotations of illegality and irregularity. 

Roman Inquisition<====>26154<====>Roman Inquisition The Roman Inquisition, formally the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition, was a system of tribunals developed by the Holy See of the Roman Catholic Church, during the second half of the 16th century, responsible for prosecuting individuals accused of a wide array of crimes relating to religious doctrine or alternate religious doctrine or alternate religious beliefs.  In the period after the Medieval Inquisition, it was one of three different manifestations of the wider Catholic Inquisition along with the Spanish Inquisition and Portuguese Inquisition. ObjectivesLike other iterations of the Inquisition, the Roman Inquisition was responsible for prosecuting individuals accused of committing offenses relating to heresy, including Protestantism, sorcery, immorality, blasphemy, Judaizing and witchcraft, as well as for censorship of printed literature.

Robert Fulton<====>26161<====>Robert Fulton  Robert Fulton (November 14, 1765 – February 24, 1815) was an American engineer and inventor who is widely credited with developing a commercially successful steamboat called The North River Steamboat of Clermonts.  That steamboat went with passengers from New York City to Albany and back again, a round trip of 300 miles, in 62 hours in 1807.  In 1800, he was commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte to attempt to design Nautilus, which was the first practical submarine in history.   He is also credited with inventing some of the world's earliest naval torpedoes for use by the British Royal Navy. 

Real Time Streaming Protocol<====>26162<====>Real Time Streaming Protocol  The Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is a network control protocol designed for use in entertainment and communications systems to control streaming media servers.  The protocol is used for establishing and controlling media sessions between end points.  Clients of media servers issue VCR-style commands, such as play, record and pause, to facilitate real-time control of the media streaming from the server to a client (Video On Demand) or from a client to the server (Voice Recording). The transmission of streaming data itself is not a task of RTSP.  Most RTSP servers use the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) in conjunction with Real-time Control Protocol (RTCP) for media stream delivery. 

Real-time Transport Protocol<====>26163<====>Real-time Transport Protocol The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a network protocol for delivering audio and video over IP networks.  RTP is used extensively in communication and entertainment systems that involve streaming media, such as telephony, video teleconference applications including WebRTC, television services and web-based push-to-talk features. RTP typically runs over User Datagram Protocol (UDP).    RTP is used in conjunction with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP).  While RTP carries the media streams (e. g. , audio and video), RTCP is used to monitor transmission statistics and quality of service (QoS) and aids synchronization of multiple streams. 

Robert Calvert<====>26167<====>Robert Calvert    Robert Newton Calvert (9 March 1945 – 14 August 1988)    was a South African-born, English writer, poet, and musician.

He attended school in London and Margate.  Having finished school he joined The Air Training Corps, where he became a corporal and played the trumpet for the 438 squadron band.   He then went on to college in Canterbury. 

Rhythm and blues<====>26168<====>Rhythm and blues    Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s.   The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when "urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat" was becoming more popular.    In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists.  R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy.

Ramadan<====>26173<====>Ramadan   Ramadan ( ;    ,  ; In Arabic phonology, it can be  , depending on the region.   also romanized as Ramzan, Ramadhan, or Ramathan) is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar,  and is observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting (Sawm) to commemorate the first revelation of the Quran to Muhammad according to Islamic belief.    This annual observance is regarded as one of the Five Pillars of Islam.The month lasts 29–30 days based on the visual sightings of the crescent moon, according to numerous biographical accounts compiled in the hadiths. 

Julio-Claudian family tree<====>26174<====>Julio-Claudian family treeAround the start of the Common Era, the family trees of the gens Julia and the gens Claudia became intertwined into the Julio-Claudian family tree as a result of marriages and adoptions. Descendancy of the emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty The Julio-Claudian dynasty was the first dynasty of Roman emperors.  All emperors of that dynasty descended from Julii Caesares and/or from Claudii.  Marriages between descendants of Sextus Julius Caesar I and Claudii had occurred from the late stages of the Roman Republic, but the intertwined Julio-Claudian family tree resulted mostly from adoptions and marriages in Imperial Rome's first decades. 

Rainhill Trials<====>26175<====>Rainhill Trials  The Rainhill Trials were an important competition in the early days of steam locomotive railways, run in October 1829 for the nearly completed Liverpool and Manchester Railway.  Five engines competed, running back and forth along a mile length of level track at Rainhill, in Lancashire (now Merseyside). Stephenson's Rocket was the only locomotive to complete the trials, and was declared the winner.  The Stephensons were accordingly given the contract to produce locomotives for the railway. BackgroundWhen the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was approaching completion, the directors of the railway ran a competition to decide whether stationary steam engines or locomotives would be used to pull the trains. 

Rayleigh scattering<====>26176<====>Rayleigh scattering Rayleigh scattering (pronounced    ), named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh (John William Strutt), Lord Rayleigh (John Strutt) refined his theory of scattering in a series of papers that were issued over a period of decades.

He is Emeritus Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics in the University of Oxford and Emeritus Fellow of Wadham College, Oxford. Penrose is known for his work in mathematical physics, in particular for his contributions to general relativity and cosmology.  He has received several prizes and awards, including the 1988 Wolf Prize for physics, which he shared with Stephen Hawking for their contribution to our understanding of the universe.  Early life and academiaBorn in Colchester, Essex, England, Roger Penrose is a son of psychiatrist and mathematician Lionel Penrose and Margaret Leathes,  and the grandson of the physiologist John Beresford Leathes and his Russian wife, Sonia Marie Natanson. 

Restriction enzyme<====>26194<====>Restriction enzyme A restriction enzyme or restriction endonuclease is an enzyme that cleaves DNA into fragments at or near specific recognition sites within the molecule known as restriction sites. Restriction enzymes are commonly classified into four types, which differ in their structure and whether they cut their DNA substrate at their recognition site, or if the recognition and cleavage sites are separate from one another.  To cut DNA, all restriction enzymes make two incisions, once through each sugar-phosphate backbone (i. e.  each strand) of the DNA double helix. 

RNA virus<====>26195<====>RNA virusAn RNA virus is a virus that has RNA (ribonucleic acid) as its genetic material.   This nucleic acid is usually single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) but may be double-stranded RNA (dsRNA).   Notable human diseases caused by RNA viruses include Ebola hemorrhoragic fever, SARS, the common cold, influenza, hepatitis C, West Nile fever, polio and measles. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) classifies RNA viruses as those that belong to Group III, Group IV or Group V of the Baltimore classification system of classifying viruses and does not consider viruses with DNA intermediates in their life cycle as RNA viruses. 

Radiocarbon dating<====>26197<====>Radiocarbon dating  Radiocarbon dating (also referred to as carbon dating or carbon-14 dating) is a method for determining the age of an object containing organic material by using the properties of radiocarbon ( ), a radioactive isotope of carbon. The method was developed by Willard Libby in the late 1940s and soon became a standard tool for archaeologists.  Libby received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in 1960.  The radiocarbon dating method is based on the fact that radiocarbon is constantly being created in the atmosphere by the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric nitrogen. 

Roald Amundsen<====>26199<====>Roald Amundsen   Roald Engelbregt Gravning Amundsen ( ; 16 July 1872 – c.  18 June 1928) was a Norwegian explorer of polar regions.  As the leader of the Antarctic expedition of 1910–12, which was the first to reach the South Pole, on 14 December 1911, he was a key expedition leader during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration.  In 1926, he was the first expedition leader for the air expedition to the North Pole, making him the first person, without dispute, to reach both poles.    He is also known as having the first expedition to traverse the Northwest Passage (1903–06) in the Arctic.

Reduced instruction set computer<====>26201<====>Reduced instruction set computer   A reduced instruction set computer, or RISC (pronounced 'risk',  ), is one whose instruction set architecture (ISA) has a set of attributes that allows it to have a lower cycles per instruction (CPI) than a complex instruction set computer (CISC).   Various suggestions have been made regarding a precise definition of RISC, but the general concept is that of a computer that has a small set of simple and general instructions, rather than a large set of complex and specialized instructions.  Another common RISC trait is their load/store architecture,    where memory is only accessed through specific instructions, rather than as a part of most instructions. 

Ralph Waldo Emerson<====>26202<====>Ralph Waldo Emerson  Ralph Waldo Emerson  (May 25, 1803 – April 27, 1882) was an American essayist, lecturer, and poet who led the transcendentalist movement of the mid-19th century.  He was seen as a champion of individualism and a prescient critic of the countervailing pressures of society, and he disseminated his thoughts through dozens of published essays and more than 1,500 public lectures across the United States. Emerson gradually moved away from the religious and social beliefs of his contemporaries, formulating and expressing the philosophy of transcendentalism in his 1836 essay "Nature".  Following this work, he gave a speech entitled "The American Scholar" in 1837, which Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. 

Women in Judaism<====>26204<====>Women in Judaism   The role of women in Judaism is determined by the Hebrew Bible, the Oral Law (the corpus of rabbinic literature), by custom, and by non-religious cultural factors.  Although the Hebrew Bible and rabbinic literature mention various female role models, religious law treats women differently in various circumstances. Gender has a bearing on familial lines: in traditional Judaism, Jewishness is passed down through the mother, although the father's name is used to describe sons and daughters in the Torah, e.  g. , "Dinah, daughter of Jacob".  Biblical times Relatively few women are mentioned in the Bible by name and role, suggesting that they were rarely in the forefront of public life.

Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act<====>26211<====>Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act    The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, commonly referred to as the RICO Act or simply RICO, is a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization.  The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering, and it allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes which they ordered others to do or assisted them in doing, closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because they did not actually commit the crime personally. 

Rhombicuboctahedron<====>26213<====>Rhombicuboctahedron In geometry, the rhombicuboctahedron, or small rhombicuboctahedron, is an Archimedean solid with eight triangular and eighteen square faces.  There are 24 identical vertices, with one triangle and three squares meeting at each.  (Note that six of the squares only share vertices with the triangles while the other twelve share an edge. ) The polyhedron has octahedral symmetry, like the cube and octahedron.  Its dual is called the deltoidal icositetrahedron or trapezoidal icositetrahedron, although its faces are not really true trapezoids. NamesJohannes Kepler in Harmonices Mundi (1618) named this polyhedron a rhombicuboctahedron, being short for truncated cuboctahedral rhombus, with cuboctahedral rhombus being his name for a rhombic dodecahedron. 

Reverse transcriptase<====>26214<====>Reverse transcriptase  A reverse transcriptase (RT) is an enzyme used to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) from an RNA template, a process termed reverse transcription.  It is mainly associated with retroviruses.  However, non-retroviruses also use RT (for example, the hepatitis B virus, a member of the Hepadnaviridae, which are dsDNA-RT viruses, while retroviruses are ssRNA viruses).  RT inhibitors are widely used as antiretroviral drugs.  RT activities are also associated with the replication of chromosome ends (telomerase) and some mobile genetic elements (retrotransposons). Retroviral RT has three sequential biochemical activities: (a) RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, (b) ribonuclease H, and (c) DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. 

Riemann mapping theorem<====>26215<====>Riemann mapping theoremIn complex analysis, the Riemann mapping theorem states that if U is a non-empty simply connected open subset of the complex number plane C which is not all of C, then there exists a biholomorphic mapping f (i. e.  a bijective holomorphic mapping whose inverse is also holomorphic) from U onto the open unit disk  D = \{z\in \mathbf{C} : |z|  This mapping is known as a Riemann mapping.  Intuitively, the condition that U be simply connected means that U does not contain any “holes”.  The fact that f is biholomorphic implies that it is a conformal map and therefore angle-preserving. 

Rhodesia<====>26219<====>RhodesiaRhodesia ( ), commonly known from 1970 onwards as the Republic of Rhodesia, was an unrecognised state in southern Africa from 1965 to 1979, equivalent in territorial terms to modern Zimbabwe.  With its capital in Salisbury (now Harare), Rhodesia was considered a de facto successor state to the former British colony of Southern Rhodesia (which had achieved responsible government in 1923). During an effort to delay an immediate transition to black majority rule, Rhodesia's predominantly white government issued its own Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965.  The UDI administration initially sought recognition as an autonomous realm within the Commonwealth of Nations, but reconstituted itself as a republic in 1970. 

Relational model<====>26220<====>Relational modelThe relational model (RM) for database management is an approach to managing data using a structure and language consistent with first-order predicate logic, first described in 1969 by Edgar F.  Codd,where all data is represented in terms of tuples, grouped into relations.  A database organized in terms of the relational model is a relational database. The purpose of the relational model is to provide a declarative method for specifying data and queries: users directly state what information the database contains and what information they want from it, and let the database management system software take care of describing data structures for storing the data and retrieval procedures for answering queries. 

Rathaus Schöneberg<====>26221<====>Rathaus Schöneberg Rathaus Schöneberg is the city hall for the borough of Tempelhof-Schöneberg in Berlin.  From 1949 until 1990 it served as the seat of the state senate of West Berlin and from 1949 until 1991 as the seat of the Governing Mayor. History The sandstone building was constructed between 1911–1914, when it replaced the old town hall of Schöneberg, at that time an independent city ( ) not yet incorporated into Greater Berlin, which took place in 1920.  The Nazi authorities had a series of war murals by Franz Eichhorst added to the interior in 1938.  In World War II the building was severely damaged by Allied bombing and during the final Battle of Berlin. 

Rædwald of East Anglia<====>26225<====>Rædwald of East Anglia  Rædwald (   , 'power in counsel'), also written as Raedwald or Redwald, was a 7th-century king of East Anglia, a long-lived Anglo-Saxon kingdom which included the present-day English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk.  He was the son of Tytila of East Anglia and a member of the Wuffingas dynasty (named after his grandfather, Wuffa), who were the first kings of the East Angles.  Details about Rædwald's reign are scarce, primarily because the Viking invasions of the 9th century destroyed the monasteries in East Anglia where many documents would have been kept. 

Rhyme<====>26226<====>Rhyme A rhyme is a repetition of similar sounds (or the same sound) in two or more words, most often in the final syllables of lines in poems and songs.   The word rhyme is also a pars pro toto ("a part (taken) for the whole") that means a short poem, such as a rhyming couplet or other brief rhyming poem such as nursery rhymes. Function of rhyming wordsRhyme partly seems to be enjoyed simply as a repeating pattern that is pleasant to hear.  It also serves as a powerful mnemonic device, facilitating memorization.  The regular use of tail rhyme helps to mark off the ends of lines, thus clarifying the metrical structure for the listener. 

Rhythm<====>26227<====>Rhythm Rhythm (from Greek  , rhythmos, "any regular recurring motion, symmetry"  ) generally means a "movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions"  .  This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years. In the performance arts, rhythm is the timing of events on a human scale; of musical sounds and silences that occur over time, of the steps of a dance, or the meter of spoken language and poetry. 

Riboflavin<====>26229<====>Riboflavin  Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B 2 , is a vitamin found in food and used as a dietary supplement.   As a supplement it is used to prevent and treat riboflavin deficiency and prevent migraines.   It may be given by mouth or injection.It is nearly always well tolerated.   Normal doses are safe during pregnancy.   Riboflavin is in the vitamin B group.   It is required by the body for cellular respiration.   Food sources include eggs, green vegetables, milk, and meat.Riboflavin was discovered in 1920, isolated in 1933, and first made in 1935.

It has an area of   and about four million inhabitants.  Its state capital and largest city is Mainz.Rhineland-Palatinate is located in western Germany and was formed after World War II by the French military government from parts of regions historically not belonging together.  The state has developed its own identity since, built on its natural and cultural heritage of extensive winegrowing, picturesque landscapes and its many castles. 

House of Romanov<====>26240<====>House of Romanov  The House of Romanov ( ; "Romanov".  Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary.   also Romanoff;   , Románovy,  ) was the second dynasty to rule Russia, after the House of Rurik, reigning from 1613 until the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II on March 15, 1917, as a result of the February Revolution. The Romanovs achieved prominence as boyars of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, later the Tsardom of Russia.  In 1613, following years of interregnum (Time of Troubles), the zemsky sobor offered the Russian crown to Mikhail Romanov.  He acceded to the throne as Michael I, becoming the first Tsar of Russia from the House of Romanov. 

Robert Bloch<====>26243<====>Robert Bloch   Robert Albert Bloch ( ; April 5, 1917 – September 23, 1994) was an American fiction writer, primarily of crime, horror, fantasy and science fiction, from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  He is best known as the writer of Psycho, the basis for the film of the same name by Alfred Hitchcock.  His fondness for a pun is evident in the titles of his story collections such as Tales in a Jugular Vein, Such Stuff as Screams Are Made Of and Out of the Mouths of Graves. Bloch wrote hundreds of short stories and over 30 novels. 

Recorder (musical instrument)<====>26244<====>Recorder (musical instrument)   The recorder is a woodwind musical instrument in the group known as internal duct flutes—flutes with a whistle mouthpiece.  A recorder can be distinguished from other duct flutes by the presence of thumb-hole for the upper hand and seven finger-holes: three for the upper hand and four for the lower.  It is the most prominent duct flute in the western classical tradition.    Recorders are made in different sizes with names and compasses roughly corresponding to different vocal ranges.  The sizes most commonly in use today are the soprano (aka "descant", lowest note C 5 ), alto (aka "treble", lowest note F 4 ), tenor (lowest note C 4 ) and bass (lowest note F 3 ). 

Received Pronunciation<====>26247<====>Received Pronunciation  Received Pronunciation (RP) is the accent of Standard English in the United Kingdom  and is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary as "the standard accent of English as spoken in the south of England",  although it can be heard from native speakers throughout England and Wales.    Peter Trudgill estimated in 1974 that 3% of people in Britain were RP speakers,    but this rough estimate has been questioned by the phonetician J.  Windsor Lewis.  RP enjoys high social prestige in Britain,  being thought of as the accent of those with power, money, and influence, though it may be perceived negatively by some as being associated with undeserved privilege.

Revised Julian calendar<====>26253<====>Revised Julian calendarThe Revised Julian calendar, also known as the Milanković calendar, or, less formally, new calendar, is a calendar, developed and proposed by the Serbian scientist Milutin Milanković in 1923, which effectively discontinued the 340 years of divergence between the naming of dates sanctioned by those Eastern Orthodox churches adopting it and the Gregorian calendar that has come to predominate worldwide.  This calendar was intended to replace the ecclesiastical calendar based on the Julian calendar hitherto in use by all of the Eastern Orthodox Church.  The Revised Julian calendar temporarily aligned its dates with the Gregorian calendar proclaimed in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII for adoption by the Christian world. 

Reform of the date of Easter<====>26254<====>Reform of the date of EasterA reform of the date of Easter has been proposed several times because the current system for determining the date of Easter is seen as presenting two significant problems:Its date varies from year to year.  It can fall on up to 35 different days in March and April of the respective calendar.  While many Christians do not consider this to be a problem, it can cause frequent difficulties of co-ordination with civil calendars, for example academic terms.  Many countries have public holidays around Easter weekend or tied to the date of Easter but spread from February to June, such as Shrove Tuesday or Ascension and Pentecost. 

Robert Lowth<====>26255<====>Robert Lowth   Robert Lowth   ( ; 27 November 1710 – 3 November 1787) was a Bishop of the Church of England, Oxford Professor of Poetry and the author of one of the most influential textbooks of English grammar. LifeLowth was born in Hampshire, Great Britain, the son of Dr William Lowth, a clergyman and Biblical commentator.   He was educated at Winchester College and became a scholar of New College, Oxford in 1729.   Lowth obtained his BA in 1733 and his Master of Arts degree in 1737.   In 1735, while still at Oxford, Lowth took orders in the Anglican Church and was appointed vicar of Ovington, Hampshire, a position he retained until 1741, when he was appointed Oxford Professor of Poetry.

He was born in 1907 as Robin William Askin, but always disliked his first name and changed it by deed poll in 1971.  Before being knighted in 1972, however, he was generally known as "Bob Askin".  Born in Sydney in 1907, Askin was educated at Sydney Technical High School.  After serving as a bank officer and as a Sergeant in the Second World War, Askin joined the Liberal Party and was elected to the seat of Collaroy at the 1950 election. 

Redshift<====>26262<====>Redshift  In physics, redshift happens when light or other electromagnetic radiation from an object is increased in wavelength, or shifted to the red end of the spectrum.  In general, whether or not the radiation is within the visible spectrum, "redder" means an increase in wavelength – equivalent to a lower frequency and a lower photon energy, in accordance with, respectively, the wave and quantum theories of light. Some redshifts are an example of the Doppler effect, familiar in the change of apparent pitches of sirens and frequency of the sound waves emitted by speeding vehicles.  A redshift occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer.

Ryuichi Sakamoto<====>26272<====>Ryuichi Sakamoto    ( ) is a Japanese musician, singer, composer, record producer, activist, writer, actor and dancer, based in Tokyo and New York.  He began his career while at university in the 1970s, as a session musician, producer, and arranger.  His first major success came in 1978 as co-founder of the electronic music trio Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO).    With bandmates Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi, Sakamoto helped play a pioneering role in the development of synth-pop, techno and house genres.  He concurrently pursued a solo career, releasing the experimental electronic fusion album Thousand Knives (1978), and later released the album B-2 Unit (1980), from which "Riot in Lagos" influenced the development of electro and hip hop music. 

Roger the Dodger<====>26273<====>Roger the Dodger    Roger the Dodger, whose real name is Roger Dawson,  is a fictional character featured regularly in the UK comic The Beano.  His strip consists solely of Roger's basic remit to avoid doing chores and homework which usually involves him concocting complex and ultimately disastrous plans, the undoing of which results in him being punished (usually by his long-suffering father).  To perform these tasks he enlists the help of his many 'dodge books'. Character historyHe first appeared in issue 561, dated 18 April 1953.  His appearance is vaguely similar to that of Dennis the Menace from the same magazine; he wears a black-and-red chequered jumper, black trousers and takes better care of his hair than his equally mischievous counterpart. 

Robert Nozick<====>26275<====>Robert Nozick  Robert Nozick ( ; November 16, 1938 – January 23, 2002) was an American philosopher.  He held the Joseph Pellegrino University Professorship at Harvard University, and was president of the American Philosophical Association.  He is best known for his books Philosophical Explanations (1981), which included his counterfactual theory of knowledge, and Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974), a libertarian answer to John Rawls' A Theory of Justice (1971), in which Nozick also presented his own theory of utopia as one in which people can freely choose the rules of the society they enter into.  His other work involved ethics, decision theory, philosophy of mind, metaphysics and epistemology. 

Redirect examination<====>26276<====>Redirect examination   When a witness is presented for testimony in the U.S. judicial system, the order is "direct" testimony, then the opposing attorney does "cross" and then "redirect" from the attorney first offering the witness. "Recross" may be allowed, but usually the opposing attorney must ask for permission from the judge before proceeding with this additional round of questioning.In Australia, Canada and South Africa the process is called re-examination.See alsoCross-examinationDirect examination 

Robert Abbot (theologian)<====>26278<====>Robert Abbot (theologian)  Robert Abbot ( ) was an English theologian who promoted puritan doctrines.  With a living at Cranbrook, Kent, he wrote anti-Catholic works and cultivated a local circle among the Kent gentry.  BiographyRobert Abbot received his education at Cambridge University, and later atOxford University.  The details of Abbot's ecclesiastical career are somewhat unclear, and can only be pieced together from fragmentary evidence, but based on something he wrote in his work Bee Thankfull London and her Sisters, it is probable that he began his church service with a posting as "assistant to a reverend divine". 

Richard III of England<====>26284<====>Richard III of England    Richard III (2 October 1452 – 22 August 1485) was King of England from 1483 until his death in 1485, at the age of 32, in the Battle of Bosworth Field.  He was the last king of the House of York and the last of the Plantagenet dynasty.  His defeat at Bosworth Field, the last decisive battle of the Wars of the Roses, marked the end of the Middle Ages in England.  He is the protagonist of  Richard III, one of William Shakespeare's history plays. When his brother King Edward IV died in April 1483, Richard was named Lord Protector of the realm for Edward's eldest son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. 

Restriction fragment length polymorphism<====>26285<====>Restriction fragment length polymorphismIn molecular biology, restriction fragment length polymorphism, or RFLP, is a technique that exploits variations in homologous DNA sequences.  It refers to a difference between samples of homologous DNA molecules from differing locations of restriction enzyme sites, and to a related laboratory technique by which these segments can be illustrated.   In RFLP analysis, the DNA sample is broken into pieces (and digested) by restriction enzymes and the resulting restriction fragments are separated according to their lengths by gel electrophoresis.   Although now largely obsolete due to the rise of inexpensive DNA sequencing technologies, RFLP analysis was the first DNA profiling technique inexpensive enough to see widespread application. 

Rocket-propelled grenade<====>26286<====>Rocket-propelled grenade A rocket-propelled grenade (often abbreviated RPG) is a shoulder-fired anti-tank weapon system that fires rockets equipped with an explosive warhead.  Most RPGs can be carried by an individual soldier.  These warheads are affixed to a rocket motor which propels the RPG towards the target and they are stabilized in flight with fins.  Some types of RPG are reloadable with new rocket-propelled grenades, while others are single-use.  RPGs, with some exceptions, are generally loaded from the muzzle.  RPGs with high explosive anti-tank warheads (HEAT) are very effective against armored vehicles such as armoured personnel carriers (APCs). 

Roy Jenkins<====>26287<====>Roy Jenkins   Roy Harris Jenkins, Baron Jenkins of Hillhead,   (11 November 1920 – 5 January 2003) was a British Labour Party, SDP and Liberal Democrat politician, and biographer of British political leaders. The son of a Welsh coal-miner and trade unionist (later a Labour MP and government minister), Roy Jenkins was educated at Oxford University and served as an intelligence officer in the Second World War.  Elected to Parliament as a Labour member in 1948, he served in several major posts in Harold Wilson's First Government.  As Home Secretary in 1965–1967, he sought to build what he described as "a civilised society", with measures such as the effective abolition in Britain of both capital punishment and theatre censorship, the decriminalisation of homosexuality, relaxing of divorce law, suspension of birching and the liberalisation of abortion law. 

List of Polish monarchs<====>26288<====>List of Polish monarchs  Poland was ruled at various times either by dukes (the 10th–14th century) or by kings (the 11th-18th century).  During the latter period, a tradition of free election of monarchs made it a uniquely electable position in Europe (16th–18th centuries). The birth of Poland as an independent nation coincides with the ascension of Duke Mieszko I  and adoption of Christianity under the authority of Rome in the year 966.  He was succeeded by his son, Bolesław I the Brave, who greatly expanded the boundaries of the Polish state and ruled as the first king in 1025. 

Richard Henry Lee<====>26289<====>Richard Henry Lee  Richard Henry Lee (January 20, 1732 June 19, 1794) was an American statesman from Virginia best known for the motion in the Second Continental Congress calling for the colonies' independence from Great Britain.  He was a signatory to the Articles of Confederation, and his "resolution for independency" of June 1776 led to the United States Declaration of Independence, which Lee signed.  He also served a one-year term as the President of the Congress of the Confederation, and was a United States Senator from Virginia from 1789 to 1792, serving during part of that time as the second President pro tempore of the upper house. 

Rajasthan<====>26291<====>Rajasthan    Rajasthan (   ; literally, "Land of Kings")  is India's largest state by area (  or 10. 4% of India's total area).  It is located on the north western side of the India, where it comprises most of the wide and inhospitable Thar Desert (also known as the "Rajasthan Desert" and "Great Indian Desert") and shares a border with the Pakistani provinces of Punjab to the northwest and Sindh to the west, along the Sutlej-Indus river valley.  Elsewhere it is bordered by five  other Indian states: Punjab to the north; Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the northeast; Madhya Pradesh to the southeast;  and Gujarat to the southwest. 

Raphael of Brooklyn<====>26292<====>Raphael of Brooklyn   Saint Raphael of Brooklyn ( ; born Raphael Hawaweeny  ; November 20, 1860 – February 27, 1915) was bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church, auxiliary bishop of Brooklyn, vicar of the Northern-American diocese, and head of the Antiochian Levantine Christian Greek Orthodox mission.  He was the first Orthodox Christian bishop consecrated on American soil.    LifeHe was born in Beirut, modern-day Lebanon, to Damascene Syrian parents of the Greek Orthodox faith who had come to Beirut fleeing a massacre of Christians in Damascus.He was first educated at the Damascus Patriarchal School that had become the leading Greek Orthodox institution of higher learning in the Levant under the leadership of Saint Joseph of Damascus. 

Reflux suppressant<====>26294<====>Reflux suppressant  A reflux suppressant is any one of a number of drugs used to combat oesophageal reflux. Commonly, following ingestion a 'raft' of alginic acid is created, floating on the stomach contents by carbon dioxide released by the drug. This forms a mechanical barrier to further reflux. Some preparations also contain antacids to protect the oesophagus.Reflux can also be coincidentally reduced by the motility stimulants and antidopaminergics.DEFAULTSORT

Russian Civil War<====>26295<====>Russian Civil War The Russian Civil War ( ; November 1917 – October 1922)  was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future.  The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants.  In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites. 

Ralph Abercromby<====>26296<====>Ralph Abercromby    Sir Ralph Abercromby   (sometimes spelt Abercrombie) (7 October 1734 28 March 1801) was a Scottish soldier and politician.  He rose to the rank of lieutenant-general in the British Army, was noted for his services during the Napoleonic Wars, and served as Commander-in-Chief, Ireland. He twice served as MP for Clackmannanshire, and he was appointed Governor of Trinidad. Early lifeHe was the eldest son of George Abercromby of Tullibody, Clackmannanshire, and a brother of the advocate Alexander Abercromby, Lord Abercromby and General Sir Robert Abercromby.  He was born at Menstrie Castle, Clackmannanshire. 

Radiometric dating<====>26298<====>Radiometric datingRadiometric dating or radioactive dating is a technique used to date materials such as rocks or carbon, in which trace radioactive impurities were selectively incorporated when they were  formed.  The method compares the abundance of a naturally occurring radioactive isotope within the material to the abundance of its decay products, which form at a known constant rate of decay.   The use of radiometric dating was first published in 1907 by Bertram Boltwood  and is now the principal source of information about the absolute age of rocks and other geological features, including the age of fossilized life forms or the age of the Earth itself, and can also be used to date a wide range of natural and man-made materials. 

Rocket<====>26301<====>Rocket  A rocket (from Italian rocchetto "bobbin")English rocket, first attested in 1566 (OED), adopted from the Italian term, given due to the similarity in shape to the bobbin or spool  used to hold the  thread to be fed to a spinning wheel.  The modern Italian term is razzo.is a missile, spacecraft, aircraft or other vehicle that obtains thrust from a rocket engine.  Rocket engine exhaust is formed entirely from propellant carried within the rocket before use.Rocket engines work by action and reaction and push rockets forward simply by expelling their exhaust in the opposite direction at high speed, and can therefore work in the vacuum of space. 

Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew<====>26304<====>Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew    Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (brand name Kew) is a non-departmental public body in the United Kingdom sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.  An internationally important botanical research and education institution, it employs 723 staff (FTE).   Its board of trustees is chaired by Marcus Agius,  a former chairman of Barclays. The organisation manages botanic gardens at Kew in Richmond upon Thames in southwest London, and at Wakehurst Place, a National Trust property in Sussex which is home to an internationally important Millennium Seed Bank, whose scientists work with partner organisations in more than 95 countries. 

Radon difluoride<====>26306<====>Radon difluoride Radon difluoride ( ) is a compound of radon, a noble gas.  Radon reacts readily with fluorine to form a solid compound, but this decomposes on attempted vaporization and its exact composition is uncertain.    Calculations suggest that it may be ionic,  unlike all other known binary noble gas compounds.  The usefulness of radon compounds is limited because of the radioactivity of radon.  The longest-lived isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.82 days, which decays by α-emission to yield Po-218. References   

Robert Penn Warren<====>26307<====>Robert Penn Warren Robert Penn Warren (April 24, 1905 – September 15, 1989) was an American poet, novelist, and literary critic and was one of the founders of New Criticism.  He was also a charter member of the Fellowship of Southern Writers.  He founded the literary journal The Southern Review with Cleanth Brooks in 1935.  He received the 1947 Pulitzer Prize for the Novel for his novel All the King's Men (1946) and the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1958 and 1979.  He is the only person to have won Pulitzer Prizes for both fiction and poetry. 

Rudyard Kipling<====>26308<====>Rudyard Kipling    Joseph Rudyard Kipling ( ; 30 December 1865 – 18 January 1936) The Times, (London) 18 January 1936, p.  12  was an English journalist, short-story writer, poet, and novelist. Kipling's works of fiction include The Jungle Book (1894), Kim (1901), and many short stories, including "The Man Who Would Be King" (1888).    His poems include "Mandalay" (1890), "Gunga Din" (1890), "The Gods of the Copybook Headings" (1919), "The White Man's Burden" (1899), and "If—" (1910).  He is regarded as a major innovator in the art of the short story; Rutherford, Andrew (1987). 

Regency dance<====>26309<====>Regency dance Regency dance is the term for historical dances of the period ranging roughly from 1790 to 1825.   Some feel that the popular use of the term "Regency dance" is not technically correct, as the actual English Regency (the future George IV ruling on behalf of mad King George III) lasted only from 1811 until 1820.   However, the term "Regency" has been used to refer to a much broader period than the historical Regency for a very long time, particularly in areas such as the history of art and architecture, literature, and clothing.   This is because there are consistencies of style over this period which make having a single term useful. 

Reproduction<====>26310<====>Reproduction  Reproduction (or procreation or breeding) is the biological process by which new individual organisms – "offspring" – are produced from their "parents".  Reproduction is a fundamental feature of all known life; each individual organism exists as the result of reproduction.  There are two forms of reproduction: asexual and sexual. In asexual reproduction, an organism can reproduce without the involvement of another organism.  Asexual reproduction is not limited to single-celled organisms.  The cloning of an organism is a form of asexual reproduction.  By asexual reproduction, an organism creates a genetically similar or identical copy of itself.

Roget's Thesaurus<====>26313<====>Roget's Thesaurus Roget's Thesaurus is a widely used English-language thesaurus, created in 1805 by Peter Mark Roget (1779–1869), British physician, natural theologian and lexicographer.  It was released to the public on 29 April 1852.  A History of Roget's ThesaurusWerner HüllenThe original edition had 15,000 words, and each new edition has been larger.  Roget's Thesaurus Karcpeles Library  The Karpeles Manuscript Library Museum houses the original manuscript in its collection.  The name "Roget" is trademarked in parts of the world, such as the United Kingdom.    By itself, it is not protected in the United States, where use of the name "Roget" in the title of a thesaurus does not necessarily indicate any relationship to Roget directly; it has come to be seen as a generic thesaurus name. 

Racial segregation<====>26316<====>Racial segregation    Racial segregation is the separation of humans into racial or other ethnic groups in daily life.  It may apply to activities such as eating in a restaurant, drinking from a water fountain, using a public toilet, attending school, going to the movies, riding on a bus, or in the rental or purchase of a home  or of hotel rooms.  Segregation is defined by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance as "the act by which a (natural or legal) person separates other persons on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds without an objective and reasonable justification, in conformity with the proposed definition of discrimination. 

Roslagen<====>26318<====>Roslagen  Roslagen is the name of the coastal areas of Uppland province in Sweden, which also constitutes the northern part of the Stockholm archipelago. Historically, it was the name for all the coastal areas of the Baltic Sea, including the eastern parts of lake Mälaren, belonging to Svealand.  The name was first mentioned in the year 1493 as "Rodzlagen".   Before that the area has been known as Roden, which is the coastal equivalent to inland Hundreds.  When the king would issue a call to leidang, the Viking Age equivalent of military conscript service, a Roden district was responsible for raising a number of ships for the leidang navy. 

Ramjet<====>26321<====>Ramjet  A ramjet, sometimes referred to as a flying stovepipe or an athodyd (an abbreviation of aero thermodynamic duct), is a form of airbreathing jet engine that uses the engine's forward motion to compress incoming air without an axial compressor or a centrifugal compressor.  Because ramjets cannot produce thrust at zero airspeed, they cannot move an aircraft from a standstill.  A ramjet-powered vehicle, therefore, requires an assisted take-off like a rocket assist to accelerate it to a speed where it begins to produce thrust.  Ramjets work most efficiently at supersonic speeds around  .   This type of engine can operate up to speeds of  . 

Ranma ½<====>26324<====>Ranma ½  is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Rumiko Takahashi.  It was serialized in Weekly Shōnen Sunday from September 1987 to March 1996, with the chapters collected into 38 tankōbon volumes by Shogakukan.  The story revolves around a teenage boy named Ranma Saotome who has trained in martial arts since early childhood.  As a result of an accident during a training journey, he is cursed to become a girl when splashed with cold water, while hot water changes him back into a boy. 

Royal Australian Navy<====>26327<====>Royal Australian Navy   The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is the naval branch of the Australian Defence Force.  Following the Federation of Australia in 1901, the ships and resources of the separate colonial navies were integrated into a national force: the Commonwealth Naval Forces.  Originally intended for local defence, the navy was granted the title of 'Royal Australian Navy' in 1911, and became increasingly responsible for defence of the region. Britain's Royal Navy continued to support the RAN and provided additional blue-water defence capability in the Pacific up to the early years of World War II.  Then, rapid wartime expansion saw the acquisition of large surface vessels and the building of many smaller warships. 

Royal Australian Air Force<====>26328<====>Royal Australian Air Force    The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), formed March 1921, is the aerial warfare branch of the Australian Defence Force.  It directly continues the traditions of the Australian Flying Corps (AFC), formed on 22 October 1912.   The RAAF provides support across a spectrum of operations such as air superiority, precision strikes, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, air mobility, and humanitarian support. The RAAF has taken part in many of the 20th century's major conflicts.  During the Second World War a number of RAAF bomber, fighter, reconnaissance and other squadrons served initially in Britain, and with the Desert Air Force located in North Africa and the Mediterranean, while the majority were later primarily deployed in the South West Pacific Area. 

Responsible government<====>26329<====>Responsible government  Responsible government is a conception of a system of government that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy.  Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part.  If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house. 

Rural flight<====>26332<====>Rural flightRural flight (or rural exodus) is the migratory pattern of peoples from rural areas into urban areas.   It is urbanization seen from the rural perspective. In modern times, it often occurs in a region following the industrialization of agriculture—when fewer people are needed to bring the same amount of agricultural output to market—and related agricultural services and industries are consolidated.   Rural flight is exacerbated when the population decline leads to the loss of rural services (such as business enterprises and schools), which leads to greater loss of population as people leave to seek those features. 

Robotech<====>26333<====>Robotech   Robotech is a science fiction franchise that began with an 85-episode anime television series produced by Harmony Gold USA in association with Tatsunoko Production and first released in the United States in 1985.  It was adapted from three original and unrelated, though visually similar, Japanese anime television series (Super Dimension Fortress Macross, Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross, and Genesis Climber Mospeada) to make a series suitable for syndication.  In the series, Robotechnology refers to the scientific advances discovered in an alien starship that crashed on a South Pacific island.   With this technology, Earth developed robotic technologies, such as transformable mecha, to fight three successive extraterrestrial invasions. 

Radioteletype<====>26341<====>RadioteletypeRadioteletype (RTTY) is a telecommunications system consisting originally of two or more electromechanical teleprinters in different locations connected by radio rather than a wired link.  These machines were superseded by personal computers (PCs) running software to emulate teleprinters.  Radioteletype evolved from earlier landline teleprinter operations that began in the mid-1800s.  The US Navy Department successfully tested printing telegraphy between an airplane and ground radio station in 1922.  Later that year, the Radio Corporation of America successfully tested printing telegraphy via their Chatham, Massachusetts, radio station to the R. M. S.  Majestic.  Commercial RTTY systems were in active service between San Francisco and Honolulu as early as April 1932 and between San Francisco and New York City by 1934. 

Register transfer language<====>26344<====>Register transfer language  In computer science, register transfer language (RTL) is a kind of intermediate representation (IR) that is very close to assembly language, such as that which is used in a compiler.   It is used to describe data flow at the register-transfer level of an architecture.  Academic papers and textbooks often use a form of RTL as an architecture-neutral assembly language.  RTL is used as the name of a specific intermediate representation in several compilers, including the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), Zephyr, and the European compiler projects CerCo and CompCert. In GCCIn GCC, RTL is generated from the GIMPLE representation, transformed by various passes in the GCC 'middle-end', and then converted to assembly language. 

Remote procedure call<====>26346<====>Remote procedure call In distributed computing, a remote procedure call (RPC) is when a computer program causes a procedure (subroutine) to execute in a different address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network), which is coded as if it were a normal (local) procedure call, without the programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote interaction.  That is, the programmer writes essentially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing program, or remote.This is a form of client–server interaction (caller is client, executor is server), typically implemented via a request–response message-passing system. 

Russian submarine Kursk (K-141)<====>26347<====>Russian submarine Kursk (K-141)  }   K-141 Kursk ( ,  , meaning "Nuclear-powered submarine Kursk") was an Oscar-II class nuclear-powered cruise-missile submarine of the Russian Navy. On 12 August 2000, K-141 Kursk was lost when it sank in the Barents Sea, killing all 118 personnel on board. ConstructionK-141 Kursk was a Project 949A class Antey ( ) submarine of the Oscar-class, known as the Oscar II by its NATO reporting name, and was the penultimate submarine of the Oscar II class designed and approved in the Soviet Union.  Construction began in 1990 at the Soviet Navy military shipyards in Severodvinsk, near Arkhangelsk, in the northern Russian SFSR. 

Radiation therapy<====>26350<====>Radiation therapy  Radiation therapy or radiotherapy, often abbreviated RT, RTx, or XRT, is therapy using ionizing radiation, generally as part of cancer treatment to control or kill malignant cells and normally delivered by a linear accelerator.  Radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body.  It may also be used as part of adjuvant therapy, to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer).  Radiation therapy is synergistic with chemotherapy, and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers.

RIPEMD<====>26363<====>RIPEMD RIPEMD (RACE  Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest) is a family of cryptographic hash functions developed in Leuven, Belgium, by Hans Dobbertin, Antoon Bosselaers and Bart Preneel at the COSIC research group at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, and first published in 1996.  RIPEMD was based upon the design principles used in MD4, and is similar in performance to the more popular SHA-1. RIPEMD-160 is an improved, 160-bit version of the original RIPEMD, and the most common version in the family.  RIPEMD-160 was designed in the open academic community, in contrast to the NSA-designed SHA-1 and SHA-2 algorithms. 

Roman law<====>26364<====>Roman law Roman law is the legal system of ancient Rome, including the legal developments spanning over a thousand years of jurisprudence, from the Twelve Tables (c.  449 BC), to the Corpus Juris Civilis (AD 529) ordered by Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I.  Roman law forms the basic framework for Civil law, the most used legal system today.  The historical importance of Roman law is reflected by the continued use of Latin legal terminology in many legal systems influenced by it, including Common law. After the dissolution of the Western Roman Empire, the Roman law remained in effect in the Eastern Roman Empire. 

Reuben James<====>26366<====>Reuben James  Reuben James (  1776 – 3 December 1838) was a boatswain's mate    of the United States Navy, famous for his heroism in the First Barbary War. CareerBorn in Delaware around 1776, James joined the United States Navy and served on several ships, including the frigate  .  During the First Barbary War, the American frigate   was captured by the Barbary pirates when it ran aground in the city of Tripoli, on the southern shores of the Mediterranean Sea.   During the course of the naval blockade of the harbor, there were numerous engagements, the most intense being the Gunboat Battle of August 3, 1804.

He also ruled as Duke of Normandy, Aquitaine and Gascony, Lord of Cyprus, Count of Poitiers, Anjou, Maine, and Nantes, and was overlord of Brittany at various times during the same period.  He was the third of five sons of King Henry II of England and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine.  He was known as   or Richard the Lionheart because of his reputation as a great military leader and warrior. 

RFPolicy<====>26369<====>RFPolicyThe RFPolicy states a method of contacting vendors about security vulnerabilities found in their products.   It was originally written by hacker and security consultant Rain Forest Puppy.  The policy gives the vendor five working days to respond to the reporter of the bug.  If the vendor fails to contact the reporter in those five days, the issue is recommended to be disclosed to the general community.  The reporter should help the vendor reproduce the bug and work out a fix.  The reporter should delay notifying the general community about the bug if the vendor provides feasible reasons for requiring so.

Reno, Nevada<====>26388<====>Reno, Nevada    Reno is a city in the U. S.  state of Nevada.  It is in Northern Nevada,  approximately   from Lake Tahoe.  Known as "The Biggest Little City in the World",  Reno is famous for its hotels and casinos and as the birthplace of Harrah's Entertainment (now known as Caesars Entertainment Corporation).  It is the county seat of Washoe County, in the northwestern part of the state.  The city sits in a high desert at the foot of the Sierra Nevada and its downtown area (along with Sparks) occupies a valley informally known as the Truckee Meadows. 

Riemann integral<====>26390<====>Riemann integral In the branch of mathematics known as real analysis, the Riemann integral, created by Bernhard Riemann, was the first rigorous definition of the integral of a function on an interval.   It was presented to the faculty at the University of Göttingen in 1854, but not published in a journal until 1868.   For many functions and practical applications, the Riemann integral can be evaluated by the fundamental theorem of calculus or approximated by numerical integration. The Riemann integral is unsuitable for many theoretical purposes.  Some of the technical deficiencies in Riemann integration can be remedied with the Riemann–Stieltjes integral, and most disappear with the Lebesgue integral. 

Run-length encoding<====>26392<====>Run-length encoding Run-length encoding (RLE) is a very simple form of lossless data compression in which runs of data (that is, sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run.   This is most useful on data that contains many such runs.  Consider, for example, simple graphic images such as icons, line drawings, and animations.  It is not useful with files that don't have many runs as it could greatly increase the file size. RLE may also be used to refer to an early graphics file format supported by CompuServe for compressing black and white images, but was widely supplanted by their later Graphics Interchange Format. 

Red–black tree<====>26397<====>Red–black tree A red–black tree is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree in computer science.   Each node of the binary tree has an extra bit, and that bit is often interpreted as the color (red or black) of the node.   These color bits are used to ensure the tree remains approximately balanced during insertions and deletions.    Balance is preserved by painting each node of the tree with one of two colors in a way that satisfies certain properties, which collectively constrain how unbalanced the tree can become in the worst case.  When the tree is modified, the new tree is subsequently rearranged and repainted to restore the coloring properties.

Retroactive continuity<====>26400<====>Retroactive continuity Retroactive continuity, or retcon for short,   is a literary device in which established facts in a fictional work are adjusted, ignored, or contradicted by a subsequently published work which breaks continuity with the former.    OverviewThere are various motivations for applying retroactive continuity, including:To accommodate desired aspects of sequels or derivative works which would otherwise be ruled out;To correct and overcome errors or problems identified in the prior work since its publication;To change how the prior work should be interpreted;To match reality, when assumptions or projections of the future are later proven wrong.  Retcons are used by authors to increase their creative freedom, on the assumption that the changes are unimportant to the audience compared to the new story which can be told.

Rosół<====>26403<====>Rosół Rosół    is a traditional Polish meat broth.  The most popular variety is rosół z kury, or clear chicken soup.  It is commonly served with fine noodles.  A vegetarian version can be made, substituting meat with oil or butter. It is  one of the most popular Polish soups and is served on family dinners and also is a traditional soup for weddings.  It is also said to be a great remedy if one catches a cold.  The name "rosół" derives from a dish made of salted meat (old conservation method) cooked in water to make it more edible. 

Risk management<====>26404<====>Risk management    Risk management is the identification, evaluation, and prioritization of risks (defined in ISO 31000 as the effect of uncertainty on objectives) followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events    or to maximize the realization of opportunities.  Risk management’s objective is to assure uncertainty does not deflect the endeavor from the business goals.  Risks can come from various sources including uncertainty in financial markets, threats from project failures (at any phase in design, development, production, or sustainment life-cycles), legal liabilities, credit risk, accidents, natural causes and disasters, deliberate attack from an adversary, or events of uncertain or unpredictable root-cause. 

Rainer Maria Rilke<====>26408<====>Rainer Maria Rilke  René Karl Wilhelm Johann Josef Maria Rilke (4 December 1875–29 December 1926)—better known as Rainer Maria Rilke ( )—was a Bohemian-Austrian poet and novelist, “widely recognized as one of the most lyrically intense German-language poets” Biography: Rainer Maria Rilke 1875–1926 on the Poetry Foundation website.  Retrieved 2 February 2013.   writing in both verse and highly lyrical prose.   Several critics have described Rilke's work as inherently “mystical”.    His writings include one novel, several collections of poetry and several volumes of correspondence in which he invokes haunting images that focus on the difficulty of communion with the ineffable in an age of disbelief, solitude and profound anxiety.

Conversion therapy<====>26410<====>Conversion therapyConversion therapy is the pseudoscientific practice of trying to change an individual's sexual orientation using psychological or spiritual interventions.  There is virtually no reliable evidence that sexuality can be controlled or changed and medical bodies warn that conversion therapy practices are ineffective and potentially seriously harmful.  Nevertheless, advocates and proponents do provide anecdotal reports of so-called "ex-gays" who claim some degree of success in becoming heterosexual.   Medical, scientific, and government organizations in the United States and Britain have expressed concern over conversion therapy and consider it potentially harmful. 

Ring homomorphism<====>26411<====>Ring homomorphismIn ring theory or abstract algebra, a ring homomorphism is a function between two rings which respects the structure. More explicitly, if R and S are rings, then a ring homomorphism is a function   such that f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b)  for all a and b in Rf(ab) = f(a) f(b)  for all a and b in Rf(1 R ) = 1 S . (Additive inverses and the additive identity are part of the structure too, but it is not necessary to require explicitly that they too are respected, because these conditions are consequences of the three conditions above.

Real Madrid Club de Fútbol ( ; Royal Madrid Football Club), commonly known as Real Madrid, or simply as Real, is a professional football club based in Madrid, Spain. Founded on 6 March 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since inception.  The word Real is Spanish for Royal and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem.  The team has played its home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947. 

Resurrection of Jesus<====>26414<====>Resurrection of Jesus   The resurrection of Jesus or resurrection of Christ is the Christian religious belief that, after being put to death, Jesus rose again from the dead.  It is the central tenet of Christian theology and part of the Nicene Creed: "On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures".  According to the New Testament, after the Romans crucified Jesus, he was anointed and buried in a new tomb by Joseph of Arimathea but God raised him from the dead  and he appeared to witnesses before he ascended into heaven, to sit at the right hand of God. 

Rube Foster<====>26415<====>Rube Foster   Andrew "Rube" Foster (September 17, 1879 – December 9, 1930) was an American baseball player, manager, and executive in the Negro leagues.  He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1981. Foster, considered by historians to have been perhaps the best African-American pitcher of the first decade of the 1900s, also founded and managed the Chicago American Giants, one of the most successful black baseball teams of the pre-integration era.  Most notably, he organized the Negro National League, the first long-lasting professional league for African-American ballplayers, which operated from 1920 to 1931. 

Ring Lardner<====>26416<====>Ring Lardner  Ringgold Wilmer "Ring" Lardner (March 6, 1885 – September 25, 1933) was an American sports columnist and short story writer best known for his satirical writings about sports, marriage, and the theatre.   He was a contemporary of Ernest Hemingway, Virginia Woolf and F.  Scott Fitzgerald, all of whom professed strong admiration for Lardner's writing. Personal lifeBorn in Niles, Michigan, Ring Lardner was the son of wealthy parents, Henry and Lena Phillips Lardner.  He was the youngest of nine children.  Lardner's name came from a cousin of the same name.  The cousin had been named by Lardner's uncle, Rear Admiral James L. 

River Clyde<====>26417<====>River Clyde    The River Clyde ( ,  ,  ) is a river, that flows into the Firth of Clyde in Scotland.  It is the eighth-longest river in the United Kingdom, and the second-longest in Scotland.  Traveling through the major city of Glasgow, it was an important river for shipbuilding and trade in the British Empire.  In the early medieval Cumbric language it was known as Clud or Clut, and was central to the Kingdom of Strathclyde (Teyrnas Ystrad Clut). CourseThe Clyde is formed by the confluence of two streams, the Daer Water (the headwaters of which are dammed to form the Daer Reservoir) and the Potrail Water. 

Rational root theorem<====>26426<====>Rational root theoremIn algebra, the rational root theorem (or rational root test, rational zero theorem, rational zero test or p/q theorem) states a constraint on rational solutions of a polynomial equation a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_0 = 0 with integer coefficients.  Solutions of the equation are roots (equivalently, zeroes) of the polynomial on the left side of the equation. If a 0  and a n  are nonzero,then each rational solution  x,when written as a fraction x = p/q in lowest terms (i. e. , the greatest common divisor of p and q is 1), satisfiesp is an integer factor of the constant term a 0 , andq is an integer factor of the leading coefficient a n . 

Round Table<====>26427<====>Round Table   The Round Table is King Arthur's famed table in the Arthurian legend, around which he and his Knights congregate.  As its name suggests, it has no head, implying that everyone who sits there has equal status.  The table was first described in 1155 by Wace, who relied on previous depictions of Arthur's fabulous retinue.  The symbolism of the Round Table developed over time; by the close of the 12th century it had come to represent the chivalric order associated with Arthur's court, the Knights of the Round Table. HistoryThe Round Table first appears in Wace's Roman de Brut, a Norman language adaptation of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae finished in 1155. 

Rosetta Stone<====>26428<====>Rosetta Stone   The Rosetta Stone is a granodiorite stele, found in 1799, inscribed with three versions of a decree issued at Memphis, Egypt in 196 BC during the Ptolemaic dynasty on behalf of King Ptolemy V.  The top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic script and Demotic script, respectively, while the bottom is in Ancient Greek.  As the decree has only minor differences between the three versions, the Rosetta Stone proved to be the key to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs. The stone, carved in black granodiorite during the Hellenistic period, is believed to have originally been displayed within a temple, possibly at nearby Sais. 

Redshirt (character)<====>26429<====>Redshirt (character) A "redshirt" is a stock character in fiction who dies soon after being introduced.  The term originates from the original Star Trek (NBC, 1966–69) television series in which the red-shirted security personnel frequently die during episodes.   Redshirt deaths are often used to dramatize the potential peril that the main characters face. Star TrekIn Star Trek, red-uniformed security officers and engineers who accompany the main characters on landing parties often suffer quick deaths.The trope first appears in the episode "What Are Little Girls Made Of?" (1966).   Of the 59 crew members killed in the series, 43 (73%) were wearing red shirts.

Restaurant<====>26437<====>Restaurant   A restaurant (  or  ;  ), or an eatery, is a business  which prepares and serves food and drinks to customers in exchange for money.  Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services, and some offer only take-out and delivery.  Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast food restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishments. In Western countries, most mid- to high-range restaurants serve alcoholic beverages such as beer, wine and light beer.

The Neovius-Nevanlinna family contained many mathematicians: Edvard Engelbert Neovius (Rolf's grandfather) taught mathematics and topography at a military academy; Edvard Rudolf Neovius (Rolf's uncle) was a professor of mathematics at the University of Helsinki from 1883–1900; Lars Theodor Neovius-Nevanlinna (Rolf's uncle) was an author of mathematical textbooks; and Otto Wilhelm Neovius-Nevanlinna (Rolf's father) was a physicist, astronomer and mathematician. 

Red panda<====>26441<====>Red panda    The red panda (Ailurus fulgens), also called the lesser panda, the red bear-cat, and the red cat-bear, is a mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China.   It has reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a waddling gait due to its shorter front legs; it is roughly the size of a domestic cat, though with a longer body and somewhat heavier.  It is arboreal, feeds mainly on bamboo, but also eats eggs, birds, and insects.  It is a solitary animal, mainly active from dusk to dawn, and is largely sedentary during the day. 

Roppongi<====>26442<====>Roppongi   is a district of Minato, Tokyo, Japan, famous for the affluent Roppongi Hills development area and popular night club scene.  Many foreign embassies are located in Roppongi, and the night life is popular with locals and foreigners alike.  It is in the central part of Tokyo, south of Akasaka and north of Azabu. HistoryThe name "Roppongi", which appears to have been coined around 1660, literally means "six trees".  Six very old and large zelkova trees used to mark the area; the first three were cleared, and the last were destroyed during World War II.

Recreational mathematics<====>26446<====>Recreational mathematics Recreational mathematics is mathematics carried out for recreation (entertainment) rather than as a strictly research and application-based professional activity.  Although it is not necessarily limited to being an endeavor for amateurs, it often involves mathematical puzzles and games. Many topics in this field require no knowledge of advanced mathematics, and recreational mathematics often appeals to children and untrained adults, inspiring their further study of the subject.    Mathematical competitions (such as those sponsored by mathematical associations) are also categorized under recreational mathematics. TopicsSome of the more well-known topics in recreational mathematics are magic squares, fractals, logic puzzles and mathematical chess problems, but this area of mathematics includes the aesthetics and culture of mathematics, peculiar or amusing stories and coincidences about mathematics, and the personal lives of mathematicians. 

Resurrection<====>26447<====>Resurrection Resurrection is the concept ofcoming back to life after death.  In a number of ancient religions, a dying-and-rising god is a deity which dies and resurrects.  The death and resurrection of Jesus, an example of resurrection, is the central focus of Christianity. As a religious concept, it is used in two distinct respects: a belief in the resurrection of individual souls that is current and ongoing (Christian idealism, realized eschatology), or else a belief in a singular resurrection of the dead at the end of the world.  The resurrection of the dead is a standard eschatological belief in the Abrahamic religions.

Riesz representation theorem<====>26452<====>Riesz representation theoremThere are several well-known theorems in functional analysis known as the Riesz representation theorem.  They are named in honor of Frigyes Riesz. This article will describe his theorem concerning the dual of a Hilbert space, which is sometimes called the Fréchet–Riesz theorem.  For the theorems relating linear functionals to measures, see Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem. The Hilbert space representation theoremThis theorem establishes an important connection between a Hilbert space and its (continuous) dual space.  If the underlying field is the real numbers, the two are isometrically isomorphic; if the underlying field is the complex numbers, the two are isometrically anti-isomorphic. 

Romano Scarpa<====>26455<====>Romano Scarpa    Romano Scarpa (September 27, 1927, Venice – April 23, 2005, Málaga) was one of the most famous Italian creators of Disney comics. BiographyGrowing up in Venice he developed a particular love for American cartoons and Disney comics, that, at the time, were published in the big format of the Topolino Giornale which was then printing now classic Floyd Gottfredson's stories.  In the Forties he opened an Animation Studio in Venice in which he produced his first works: some commercials, a short titled E poi venne il diluvio and another one titled La piccola fiammiferaia (1953, based on Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Match Girl), distributed in Italy together with Robert Aldrich's Attack! (1956). 

Rosa Parks<====>26458<====>Rosa ParksRosa Louise McCauley Parks (February 4, 1913 – October 24, 2005) was an activist in the Civil Rights Movement, whom the United States Congress called "the first lady of civil rights" and "the mother of the freedom movement".  On December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, Parks refused to obey bus driver James F.  Blake's order to give up her seat in the "colored section" to a white passenger, after the whites-only section was filled.  Parks was not the first person to resist bus segregation.  Others had taken similar steps, including Bayard Rustin in 1942,  Irene Morgan in 1946, Lillie Mae Bradford in 1951,    Sarah Louise Keys in 1952, and the members of the ultimately successful Browder v. 

Ringworld (role-playing game)<====>26459<====>Ringworld (role-playing game) The Ringworld science fiction role-playing game was published by Chaosium in 1984, using the Basic Role-Playing system for its rules and Larry Niven's Ringworld novels as a setting. SettingThe setting is a distant future based on extrapolation of as much hard science as Niven had available.  Specifically, it's the 29th century.  "Known Space" (also the commonly used title for Larry Niven's future history science fiction series) is about 80 light years in diameter with 10,000 stars, including Human Space (40 light years diameter, 524 stars in 357 systems, 30 billion humans, ⅔ on Earth), as well as neighbouring Alien civilisations. 

Risus<====>26461<====>Risus Risus: The Anything RPG is a rules-light generic role-playing game (RPG) written, designed and illustrated by S.  John Ross of Cumberland Games and Diversions.  Risus is available free on the web.  It was first published online in 1993.  Earlier versions of the game were titled GUCS: The Generic Universal Comedy System (a parody of GURPS) and were distributed privately beginning in 1989. HistoryRisus (Latin for “laughter”) is a comedy game  (often described by its creator as a "joke game") and uses a cliché (character class) system  inspired by the broad "career scale" skills in Greg Gorden's DC Heroes RPG (Mayfair Games), and later influenced by Atlas Games' Over the Edge. 

Rigel<====>26463<====>Rigel  Rigel, also designated Beta Orionis (β Orionis, abbreviated Beta Ori, β Ori), is generally the seventh-brightest star in the night sky and the brightest star in the constellation of Orion—though periodically it is outshined within the constellation by the variable Betelgeuse.  With a visual magnitude of 0. 13, it is a remote and luminous star some 863 light-years distant from Earth. The star as seen from Earth is actually a multiple star system of three to five stars, the primary star (Rigel A) being a blue-white supergiant which is estimated to be anywhere from 120,000 to 279,000 times as luminous as the Sun, depending on the method used to calculate its properties. 

Reforms of Amānullāh Khān and civil war<====>26464<====>Reforms of Amānullāh Khān and civil war   Amānullāh Khān reigned in Afghanistan from 1919, achieving full independence from the British Empire shortly afterwards.  Before the Treaty of Rawalpindi was concluded in 1921, Afghanistan had already begun to establish its own foreign policy, including diplomatic relations with the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in 1919.  During the 1920s, Afghanistan established diplomatic relations with most major countries. The second round of Anglo–Afghan negotiations for final peace were inconclusive.  Both sides were prepared to agree on Afghan independence in foreign affairs, as provided for in the previous agreement. 

Μ-recursive function<====>26469<====>Μ-recursive function In mathematical logic and computer science, the μ-recursive functions are a class of partial functions from natural numbers to natural numbers that are "computable" in an intuitive sense.  In computability theory, it is shown that the μ-recursive functions are precisely the functions that can be computed by Turing machines.   The μ-recursive functions are closely related to primitive recursive functions, and their inductive definition (below) builds upon that of the primitive recursive functions.  However, not every μ-recursive function is a primitive recursive function—the most famous example is the Ackermann function. Other equivalent classes of functions are the λ-recursive functions and the functions that can be computed by Markov algorithms.

Rat<====>26471<====>Rat    Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. "True rats" are members of the genus Rattus, the most important of which to humans are the black rat, Rattus rattus, and the brown rat, Rattus norvegicus.  Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats. Rats are typically distinguished from mice by their size.

Replicant<====>26473<====>Replicant   A replicant is a fictional bioengineered or biorobotic android in the 1982 film Blade Runner, in its 2017 sequel Blade Runner 2049, and in the 1997 video game based on the film.  The 'Nexus' series of replicants are virtually identical to adult humans, but have superior strength, speed, agility, resilience, and intelligence, to varying degrees depending on the model.    Thus a replicant can only be detected by means of the fictional Voight-Kampff test, in which emotional responses are provoked; replicants' nonverbal responses differ from humans'.  Nexus 6 replicants also have a safety mechanism, namely a four-year lifespan, to prevent them from developing empathic abilities (and, therefore, immunity to the test). 

Roman Jakobson<====>26474<====>Roman Jakobson  Roman Osipovich Jakobson ( ; October 11, 1896 Kucera, Henry.  1983.  "Roman Jakobson. " Language: Journal of the Linguistic Society of America 59(4): 871–883.   – July 18, "Roman Jakobson: A Brief Chronology", compiled by Stephen Rudy  1982) was a Russian–American linguist and literary theorist. As a pioneer of the structural analysis of language, which became the dominant trend in linguistics during the first half of the 20th century, Jakobson was among the most influential linguists of the century.  Influenced by the work of Ferdinand de Saussure, Jakobson developed, with Nikolai Trubetzkoy, techniques for the analysis of sound systems in languages, inaugurating the discipline of phonology. 

Rudolph Pariser<====>26475<====>Rudolph Pariser Rudolph Pariser (born December 8, 1923) is a physical and polymer chemist.   He was born in Harbin, China to merchant parents.   He attended the Von Hindenburg Schule in Harbin, an American Missionary School in Beijing and American School in Japan in Tokyo.   He left for the United States just before World War II broke out.    He received his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1944, and his Ph.  D.  degree from the University of Minnesota in physical chemistry in 1950.   From 1944 to 1946, during World War II and shortly afterward, he served in the United States Army. 

Rendezvous with Rama<====>26476<====>Rendezvous with Rama    Rendezvous with Rama is a science fiction novel by British writer Arthur C.  Clarke first published in 1973.  Set in the 2130s, the story involves a   cylindrical alien starship that enters Earth's solar system.  The story is told from the point of view of a group of human explorers who intercept the ship in an attempt to unlock its mysteries.  The novel won both the Hugo    and Nebula    awards upon its release, and is regarded as one of the cornerstones in Clarke's bibliography. 

Rust<====>26477<====>Rust    Rust is an iron oxide, a usually red oxide formed by the redox reaction of iron and oxygen in the presence of water or air moisture.  Several forms of rust are distinguishable both visually and by spectroscopy, and form under different circumstances.   Rust consists of hydrated iron(III) oxides Fe 2 O 3 ·nH 2 O and iron(III) oxide-hydroxide (FeO(OH), Fe(OH) 3 ). Given sufficient time, oxygen, and water, any iron mass will eventually convert entirely to rust and disintegrate.  Surface rust is flaky andfriable, and it provides no protection to the underlying iron, unlike the formation of patina on copper surfaces. 

Real analysis<====>26478<====>Real analysisReal analysis (traditionally, the theory of functions of a real variable) is a branch of mathematical analysis dealing with the real numbers and real-valued functions of a real variable.  In particular, it deals with the analytic properties of real functions and sequences, including convergence and limits of sequences of real numbers, the calculus of the real numbers, and continuity, smoothness and related properties of real-valued functions. ScopeConstruction of the real numbers The theorems of real analysis rely intimately upon the structure of the real number line.   The real number system consists of a set ( \mathbb{R} ), together with two operations (+ and •) and an order ( (\mathbb{R},+,\bullet, . 

Richie Benaud<====>26479<====>Richie Benaud    Richard Benaud, OBE ( ; 6 October 1930 – 10 April 2015) was an Australian cricketer who, after his retirement from international cricket in 1964, became a highly regarded commentator on the game. Benaud was a Test cricket all-rounder, blending leg spin bowling with lower-order batting aggression.  Along with fellow bowling all-rounder Alan Davidson, he helped restore Australia to the top of world cricket in the late 1950s and early 1960s after a slump in the early 1950s.  In 1958 he became Australia's Test captain until his retirement in 1964.  He became the first player to reach 200 wickets and 2,000 runs in Test cricket, arriving at that milestone in 1963. 

Radio Research Project<====>26480<====>Radio Research Project The Radio Research Project was a social research project funded by the Rockefeller Foundation to look into the effects of mass media on society.  In 1937, the Rockefeller Foundation started funding research to find the effects of new forms of mass media on society, especially radio.   Several universities joined up and a headquarters was formed at the School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University.   A particularly influential program of effects research was pursued in the Office of Radio Research (ORR) established by the Rockefeller Foundation under the auspices of Princeton University. 

Religious pluralism<====>26484<====>Religious pluralism  Religious pluralism is an attitude or policy regarding the diversity of religious belief systems co-existing in society.  It can indicate one or more of the following:As the name of the worldview according to which one's religion is not the sole and exclusive source of truth, and thus the acknowledgement that at least some truths and true values exist in other religions. As acceptance of the concept that two or more religions with mutually exclusive truth claims are equally valid.  This may be considered a form of either toleration (a concept that arose as a result of the European wars of religion) or moral relativism. 

Calendar-based contraceptive methods<====>26485<====>Calendar-based contraceptive methodsCalendar-based methods are various methods of estimating a woman's likelihood of fertility, based on a record of the length of previous menstrual cycles.  Various methods are known as the Knaus–Ogino method and the rhythm method.  The standard days method is also considered a calendar-based method, because when using it, a woman tracks the days of her menstrual cycle without observing her physical fertility signs.   The standard days method is based on a fixed formula taking into consideration the timing of ovulation, the functional life of the sperm and the ovum, and the resulting likelihood of pregnancy on particular days of the menstrual cycle. 

Roulette<====>26487<====>Roulette Roulette is a casino game named after the French word meaning little wheel.  In the game, players may choose to place bets on either a single number, various groupings of numbers, the colors red or black, whether the number is odd or even, or if the numbers are high (19–36) or low (1–18).  Interestingly, the sum of all the numbers on the roulette wheel (from 0 to 36) is 666, which is the "Number of the Beast".   One legend says that François Blanc made a deal with the devil to obtain the secrets of roulette. 

Reference counting<====>26490<====>Reference counting  In computer science, reference counting is a technique of storing the number of references, pointers, or handles to a resource such as an object, block of memory, disk space or other resource. It may also refer, more specifically, to a garbage collection algorithm that uses these reference counts to deallocate objects which are no longer referenced.  Use in garbage collectionAs a collection algorithm, reference counting tracks, for each object, a count of the number of references to it held by other objects.  If an object's reference count reaches zero, the object has become inaccessible, and can be destroyed. 

Red-eye effect<====>26491<====>Red-eye effect  The red-eye effect in photography is the common appearance of red pupils in color photographs of the eyes of humans and several other animals.   It occurs when using a photographic flash very close to the camera lens (as with most compact cameras) in ambient low light. CausesIn flash photography the light of the flash occurs too fast for the pupil to close, so much of the very bright light from the flash passes into the eye through the pupil, reflects off the fundus at the back of the eyeball and out through the pupil.   The camera records this reflected light. 

Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2<====>26492<====>Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2  Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2, also known as herpes zoster oticus, is a disorder that is caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus in the geniculate ganglion, a nerve cell bundle of the facial nerve.  Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 typically presents with inability to move many facial muscles, pain in the ear, taste loss on the front of the tongue, dry eyes and mouth, and a vesicular rash. . Signs and symptomsThe symptoms and signs include acute facial nerve paralysis, pain in the ear, taste loss in the front two-thirds of the tongue, dry mouth and eyes, and an erythematous vesicular rash    in the ear canal, the tongue, and/or hard palate. 

Race and intelligence<====>26494<====>Race and intelligence The connection between race and intelligence has been a subject of debate in both popular science and academic research since the inception of IQ testing in the early 20th century.  While tests have broadly shown differences in average scores based on self-identified race or ethnicity, there is considerable debate as to whether and to what extent those differences reflect environmental factors as opposed to genetic ones, as well as to the definitions of what "race" and "intelligence" are, and whether they can be objectively defined at all.   Currently, there is no non-circumstantial evidence that these differences in test scores have a genetic component, although some researchers believe that the existing circumstantial evidence makes it at least plausible that hard evidence for a genetic component will eventually be found. 

Retirement<====>26495<====>Retirement  Retirement is the point where a person stops employment completely.    A person may also semi-retire by reducing work hours. An increasing number of individuals are choosing to put off this point of total retirement, by selecting to exist in the emerging state of Pre-tirement.  Many people choose to retire when they are eligible for private or public pension benefits, although some are forced to retire when physical conditions no longer allow the person to work any longer (by illness or accident) or as a result of legislation concerning their position.   In most countries, the idea of retirement is of recent origin, being introduced during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 

Boeing RC-135<====>26501<====>Boeing RC-135  The Boeing RC-135 is a family of large reconnaissance aircraft built by Boeing and modified by a number of companies, including General Dynamics, Lockheed, LTV, E-Systems, and L3 Technologies, and used by the United States Air Force and Royal Air Force to support theater and national level intelligence consumers with near real-time on-scene collection, analysis and dissemination capabilities.  Based on the C-135 Stratolifter airframe, various types of RC-135s have been in service since 1961.  Unlike the C-135 and KC-135 which are recognized by Boeing as the Model 717,    the RC-135 is internally designated as the Model 739 by the company.

Reverse Polish notation<====>26513<====>Reverse Polish notation Reverse Polish notation (RPN), also known as Polish postfix notation or simply postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands, in contrast to Polish notation (PN), in which operators precede their operands.  It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands.  The description "Polish" refers to the nationality of logician Jan Łukasiewicz,   (Reprinted by Garland Publishing in 1987.   )  who invented Polish notation in 1924.The reverse Polish scheme was proposed in 1954 by Arthur Burks, Don Warren, and Jesse Wright  and was independently reinvented by Friedrich L.

Rhotic consonant<====>26515<====>Rhotic consonantIn phonetics, rhotic consonants,  or "R-like" sounds, are liquid consonants that are traditionally represented orthographically by symbols derived from the Greek letter rho, including  ,   in the Latin script and  ,   in the Cyrillic script.  They are transcribed in the International Phonetic Alphabet by upper- or lower-case variants of Roman  ,  :   ,   ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . This class of sounds is difficult to characterise phonetically; from a phonetic standpoint, there is no single articulatory correlate common to rhotic consonants.

Referential transparency<====>26526<====>Referential transparency  Referential transparency and referential opacity are properties of parts of computer programs.  An expression is said to be referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing the program's behavior.   As a result, evaluating a referentially transparent function gives the same value for same arguments.  Such functions are called pure functions.  An expression that is not referentially transparent is called referentially opaque. In mathematics all function applications are referentially transparent, by the definition of what constitutes a mathematical function.  However, this is not always the case in programming, where the terms procedure and method are used to avoid misleading connotations. 

Reaganomics<====>26529<====>Reaganomics Reaganomics ( ; a portmanteau of [Ronald] Reagan and economics attributed to Paul Harvey)  refers to the economic policies promoted by U. S.

Raku ware<====>26551<====>Raku ware  is a type of Japanese pottery traditionally used in Japanese tea ceremonies, most often in the form of chawan tea bowls.  It is traditionally characterised by being hand-shaped rather than thrown; fairly porous vessels, which result from low firing temperatures; lead glazes; and the removal of pieces from the kiln while still glowing hot.  In the traditional Japanese process, the fired raku piece is removed from the hot kiln and is allowed to cool in the open air.  The familiar technique of placing the ware in a container filled with combustible material is not a traditional Raku practice.

Rank (linear algebra)<====>26561<====>Rank (linear algebra)In linear algebra, the rank of a matrix A is the dimension of the vector space generated (or spanned) by its columns.   This corresponds to the maximal number of linearly independent columns of A.  This, in turn, is identical to the dimension of the space spanned by its rows.Rank is thus a measure of the "nondegenerateness" of the system of linear equations and linear transformation encoded by A.   There are multiple equivalent definitions of rank.  A matrix's rank is one of its most fundamental characteristics. The rank is commonly denoted rank(A) or rk(A); sometimes the parentheses are not written, as in rank A. 

Marine archeology in the Gulf of Khambhat<====>26563<====>Marine archeology in the Gulf of KhambhatMarine archeology in the Gulf of Khambhat - earlier known as Gulf of Cambay - centers on findings made in December 2000 by the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT).  NIOT came across palaeo river channels in the sea.  These were seen by the scientists involved to be the extension of the present day major rivers of the area.  In a similar marine survey, in a Coastal Research Ship during 1999-2000 when Dr S Badrinaryan was the Chief Scientist, several unusual frames of Side Scan Sonar images were encountered.  These had square and rectangular features in an arranged geometric fashion which are not expected by the scientist in the marine domain.

Rennet<====>26572<====>Rennet Rennet   is a complex of enzymes produced in the stomachs of ruminant mammals.   Chymosin, its key component, is a protease enzyme that curdles the casein in milk.   This helps young mammals digest their mothers' milk.  Rennet can also be used to separate milk into solid curds for cheesemaking and liquid whey.   In addition to chymosin, rennet contains other important enzymes such as pepsin and a lipase. Rennet is used in the production of most cheeses.  The mammal's digestive system must be accessed to obtain its rennet.  Non-animal alternatives for rennet are also available.

Rhythm guitar<====>26587<====>Rhythm guitarIn music performances, rhythm guitar is a technique and role that performs a combination of two functions: to provide all or part of the rhythmic pulse in conjunction with singers or other instruments; and to provide all or part of the harmony, i. e.  the chords, where a chord is a group of notes played together.  Therefore, the basic technique of rhythm guitar is to hold down a series of chords with the fretting hand while strumming rhythmically with the other hand.  More developed rhythm techniques include arpeggios, damping, riffs, chord solos, and complex strums. In ensembles or "bands" playing within the acoustic, country, blues, rock or metal genres (among others), a guitarist playing the rhythm part of a composition plays the role of supporting the melodic lines and solos played on the lead instrument or instruments, be they string, wind, brass, keyboard or even percussion instruments, or simply the human voice, in the sense of playing steadily throughout the piece, whereas lead instruments and singers switch between carrying the main or counter melody and falling silent. 

Red Hot Chili Peppers<====>26589<====>Red Hot Chili Peppers  Red Hot Chili Peppers are an American funk rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983.

Relay<====>26590<====>Relay  A relay is an electrically operated switch.  Many relays use an electromagnet to mechanically operate a switch, but other operating principles are also used, such as solid-state relays.  Relays are used where it is necessary to control a circuit by a separate low-power signal, or where several circuits must be controlled by one signal.  The first relays were used in long distance telegraph circuits as amplifiers: they repeated the signal coming in from one circuit and re-transmitted it on another circuit.  Relays were used extensively in telephone exchanges and early computers to perform logical operations.

Sabbath in Christianity<====>26671<====>Sabbath in ChristianitySabbath in Christianity is the inclusion or adoption in Christianity of a Sabbath day.  Established within Judaism through Mosaic Law, Christians inherited a Sabbath practice that reflected two great precepts: the commandment to "remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy"  and God's blessing of the seventh day (Saturday) as a day of rest in the Genesis creation narrative and declared as made for man by Jesus.   The first of these provisions was associated in Judaism with the assembly of the people to worship in the Temple in Jerusalem or in synagogues. The position now dominant in Western Christianity is that observance of the Lord's Day, Sunday, supplanted or superseded the Sabbath commandment in that the former "celebrated the Christian community's deliverance from captivity to sin, Satan, and worldly passions, made possible by the resurrection on the first day of the week.

Swedish language<====>26689<====>Swedish language  Swedish (   ) is a North Germanic language spoken natively by more than 10 million people - predominantly in Sweden (as sole official language), and in parts of Finland, where it has equal legal standing with Finnish.  It is largely mutually intelligible with Norwegian and to some extent also Danish, although the amount of mutual intelligibility is largely dependent on the dialect and accent of the speaker.  Both Norwegian and Danish are generally easier to read than to listen to because of difference in accent and tone when speaking.  Swedish is a descendant of Old Norse, the common language of the Germanic peoples living in Scandinavia during the Viking Era. 

Set (mathematics)<====>26691<====>Set (mathematics) In mathematics, a set is a collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right.  For example, the numbers 2, 4, and 6 are distinct objects when considered separately, but when they are considered collectively they form a single set of size three, written {2,4,6}.  The concept of a set is one of the most fundamental in mathematics.  Developed at the end of the 19th century, set theory is now a ubiquitous part of mathematics, and can be used as a foundation from which nearly all of mathematics can be derived.  In mathematics education, elementary topics such as Venn diagrams are taught at a young age, while more advanced concepts are taught as part of a university degree. 

Science<====>26700<====>ScienceScience (from Latin scientia, meaning "knowledge")    is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  Contemporary science is typically subdivided into the natural sciences which study the material world, the social sciences which study people and societies, and the formal sciences like mathematics.  The formal sciences are often distinguished from the empirical sciences as the former does not depend on empirical observations. Disciplines which use science like engineering and medicine may also be considered to be applied sciences.

Statistic<====>26703<====>Statistic  A statistic (singular) or sample statistic is a single measure of some attribute of a sample (e. g. , its arithmetic mean value).  It is calculated by applying a function (statistical algorithm) to the values of the items of the sample, which are known together as a set of data. More formally, statistical theory defines a statistic as a function of a sample where the function itself is independent of the sample's distribution; that is, the function can be stated before realization of the data.  The term statistic is used both for the function and for the value of the function on a given sample. 

Sean Connery<====>26709<====>Sean ConnerySir Thomas Sean Connery ( ; born 25 August 1930) is a retired Scottish actor and producer who has won an Academy Award, two BAFTA Awards (one of them being a BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award) and three Golden Globes (including the Cecil B.  DeMille Award and a Henrietta Award). Connery was the first actor to portray the character James Bond in film, starring in seven Bond films between 1962 and 1983.   In 1988, Connery won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in The Untouchables.  His film career also includes such films as Marnie, The Name of the Rose, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, The Hunt for Red October, Finding Forrester, Highlander, Murder on the Orient Express, Dragonheart, and The Rock. 

Sculpture<====>26714<====>Sculpture Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions.  It is one of the plastic arts.  Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials but, since Modernism, there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process.  A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or molded, or cast.  Sculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials, and often represents the majority of the surviving works (other than pottery) from ancient cultures, though conversely traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely. 

Slashdot<====>26715<====>Slashdot   Slashdot (sometimes abbreviated as /. ) is a social news website that originally billed itself as "News for Nerds.  Stuff that Matters".  It features news stories on science, technology, and politics that are submitted and evaluated by site users and editors.  Each story has a comments section attached to it where users can add online comments.  The website was founded in 1997 by Hope College students Rob Malda, also known as "CmdrTaco", and classmate Jeff Bates, also known as "Hemos".  In 2012, they sold it to  DHI Group, Inc.  (i. 

South Australia<====>26716<====>South Australia    South Australia (abbreviated as SA) is a state in the southern central part of Australia.  It covers some of the most arid parts of the country.  With a total land area of  , it is the fourth-largest of Australia's states and territories.  It has a total of 1. 7 million people, and its population is the most highly centralised of any state in Australia, with more than 75 percent of South Australians living in the capital, Adelaide, or its environs.  Other population centres in the state are relatively small. South Australia shares borders with all of the other mainland states, and with the Northern Territory; it is bordered to the west by Western Australia, to the north by the Northern Territory, to the north-east by Queensland, to the east by New South Wales, to the south-east by Victoria, and to the south by the Great Australian Bight. 

Slime mold<====>26725<====>Slime mold Slime mold or slime mould is an informal name given to several kinds of unrelated eukaryotic organisms that can live freely as single cells, but can aggregate together to form multicellular reproductive structures.  Slime molds were formerly classified as fungi but are no longer considered part of that kingdom.Although not related to one another, they are still sometimes grouped for convenience within the paraphyletic group referred to as kingdom Protista. More than 900 species of slime mold occur all over the world.  Their common name refers to part of some of these organisms' life cycles where they can appear as gelatinous "slime". 

Substitution splice<====>26737<====>Substitution splice   The substitution spliceor stop trick  is a cinematic special effect in which filmmakers achieve an appearance, disappearance, or transformation    by altering one or more selected aspects of the mise-en-scène between two shotswhile maintaining unicity in the framing and the other aspects of the mise-en-scène of both shots.  The effect is usually polished by careful editing to establish a seamless cut and optimal moment of change.   It has also been referred to as stop motion substitution or stop-action.  The pioneering French filmmaker Georges Méliès claimed to have accidentally developed the stop trick, as he wrote in Les Vues Cinématographiques in 1907   (translated from French):  According to the film scholar Jacques Deslandes, it is more likely that Méliès discovered the trick by carefully examining a print of the Edison Manufacturing Company's 1895 film The Execution of Mary Stuart, in which a primitive version of the trick appears. 

Scandinavia<====>26740<====>Scandinavia    Scandinavia    is a region in Northern Europe, characterized by common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages.   The term Scandinavia in local usage covers the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, but in English usage, it also sometimes refers to the Scandinavian Peninsula or to the broader region which  includes Finland and Iceland.   This broader region is usually known locally as the Nordic countries.  The remote Norwegian islands of Svalbard and Jan Mayen are usually not seen as a part of Scandinavia, nor is Greenland, a constituent country within the Kingdom of Denmark. 

Stockholm<====>26741<====>StockholmStockholm ( ;or   )  is the capital of Sweden and the most populous city in the Nordic countries;942,370 people live in the municipality,    approximately 1. 5 million in the urban area,  and 2. 3 million in the metropolitan area.   The city stretches across fourteen islands where Lake Mälaren flows into the Baltic Sea.  Just outside the city and along the coast is the island chain of the Stockholm archipelago.  The area has been settled since the Stone Age, in the 6th millennium BC, and was founded as a city in 1252 by Swedish statesman Birger Jarl. 

Stamp collecting<====>26742<====>Stamp collecting Stamp collecting is the collecting of postage stamps and related objects.  It is related to philately which is the study of stamps.  It has been one of the world's most popular hobbies since the late nineteenth century with the rapid growth of the postal service.    Stamp collecting proved to be an almost perfect hobby for collectors because there was a never ending stream of new stamps as each country sought to advertise its distinctiveness through its stamps. CollectingStamp collecting is generally accepted as one of the areas that make up the wider subject of philately, which is the study of stamps. 

Sigmund Freud<====>26743<====>Sigmund FreudSigmund Freud (   ;   ; born Sigismund Schlomo Freud; 6 May 1856 – 23 September 1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst.   Freud was born to Galician Jewish parents in the Moravian town of Freiberg, in the Austrian Empire.  He qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 at the University of Vienna.    Upon completing his habilitation in 1885, he was appointed a docent in neuropathology and became an affiliated professor in 1902. 

South Dakota<====>26746<====>South Dakota    South Dakota ( ;    ) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States.  It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who compose a large portion of the population and historically dominated the territory.  South Dakota is the 17th most expansive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States.  As the southern part of the former Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota.  Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 174,000, is South Dakota's largest city. 

Switzerland<====>26748<====>Switzerland   Switzerland ( ) , officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe.  It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities. Bern is referred to as "federal city" ( ,  ,  ).  Swiss law does not designate a capital as such, but the federal parliament and government are located in Bern, while the federal courts are located in other cities.   The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, There are several definitions.  See Geography of Switzerland. 

Sri Lanka<====>26750<====>Sri Lanka  Sri Lanka (  or  ;   Sinhala: ශ්‍රී ලංකා  , Tamil: இலங்கை Ilaṅkai), officially the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, is an island country in South Asia, located southeast of India and northeast of the Maldives. The island is home to many cultures, languages and ethnicities.  The majority of the population is from the Sinhalese ethnicity, while a large minority of Tamils have also played an influential role in the island's history; Christians in both groups are recent converts who have kept the traditional culture.  Moors, Burghers, Malays, Chinese, and the aboriginal Vedda are also established groups on the island. 

Sun<====>26751<====>Sun The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System.   It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma,  with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth.  Its diameter is about 1. 39 million kilometers, i. e.  109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99. 86% of the total mass of the Solar System. 

Smiley<====>26752<====>Smiley   A smiley (sometimes called a happy face or smiley face) is a stylized representation of a smiling humanoid face that is a part of popular culture worldwide.  The classic form designed by Harvey Ball in 1963 comprises a yellow circle with two black dots representing eyes and a black arc representing the mouth ( ) On the Internet and in other plain text communication channels, the emoticon form (sometimes also called the smiley-face emoticon) has traditionally been most popular, typically employing a colon and a right parenthesis to form sequences like  :-) ,  :) , or  (:  that resemble a smiling face when viewed after rotation through 90 degrees. 

Signature<====>26753<====>Signature   A signature ( ; from  , "to sign") is a handwritten (and often stylized) depiction of someone's name, nickname, or even a simple "X" or other mark that a person writes on documents as a proof of identity and intent.  The writer of a signature is a signatory or signer.  Similar to a handwritten signature, a signature work describes the work as readily identifying its creator.  A signature may be confused with an autograph, which is chiefly an artistic signature.  This can lead to confusion when people have both an autograph and signature and as such some people in the public eye keep their signatures private whilst fully publishing their autograph.

Sino-Tibetan languages<====>26756<====>Sino-Tibetan languages  The Sino-Tibetan languages, in a few sources also known as Trans-Himalayan, are a family of more than 400 languages spoken in East Asia, Southeast Asia and South Asia.  The family is second only to Indo-European in terms of the number of native speakers.  The Sino-Tibetan languages with the most native speakers are the varieties of Chinese (1. 3 billion speakers, the most of any language on Earth if counted as a single language), Burmese (33 million), and the Tibetic languages (8 million); but many Sino-Tibetan languages are spoken by small communities in remote mountain areas and as such are poorly documented. 

Slavic languages<====>26757<====>Slavic languages   The Slavic languages (also called Slavonic languages) are the Indo-European languages spoken by the Slavic peoples, originally from Eastern Europe.  They are thought to descend from a proto-language called Proto-Slavic spoken during the Early Middle Ages, which in turn is thought to have descended from the earlier Proto-Balto-Slavic language, linking the Slavic languages to the Baltic languages in a Balto-Slavic group within the Indo-European family. The Slavic languages are divided intro three subgroups: East, West, and South, which together constitute more than twenty languages.  Of these, ten have at least one million speakers and official status as the national languages of the countries in which they are predominantly spoken: Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian (of the East group), Polish, Czech and Slovak (of the West group) and Slovene, Serbo-Croatian, Macedonian and Bulgarian (of the South group). 

International System of Units<====>26764<====>International System of UnitsThe International System of Units (SI, abbreviated from the French  ) is the modern form of the metric system, and is the most widely used system of measurement.  It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units (ampere, kelvin, second, metre, kilogram, candela, mole) and a set of twenty decimal prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units.  The system also specifies names for 22 derived units for other common physical quantities like lumen, watt, etc. 

Sirenia<====>26768<====>Sirenia    The Sirenia, commonly referred to as sea cows or sirenians, are an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters.  The Sirenia currently comprise the families Dugongidae (the dugong) and Trichechidae (manatees) with a total of four species.  The Protosirenidae (Eocene sirenians) and Prorastomidae (terrestrial sirenians) families are extinct.  Sirenians are classified in the clade Paenungulata, alongside the elephants and the hyraxes, and evolved in the Eocene 50 million years ago.  The Dugongidae diverged from the Trichechidae in the late Eocene or early Oligocene. 

South America<====>26769<====>South AmericaSouth America   is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere.  It may also be considered a subcontinent of the Americas,which is how it is viewed in the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking regions of the Americas.  The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).    It is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean; North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest. 

Spindletop<====>26771<====>Spindletop  Spindletop is a salt dome oil field located in the southern portion of Beaumont, Texas in the United States.  The Spindletop dome was derived from the Louann Salt evaporite layer of the Jurassic geologic period.   On January 10, 1901, a well at Spindletop struck oil ("came in").  The Spindletop gusher blew for nine days at a rate estimated at   of oil per day.   , Texas State Historical Association  Gulf Oil and Texaco, now part of Chevron Corporation, were formed to develop production at Spindletop.    According to Daniel Yergin, it was the Spindletop discovery that lead the United States into the oil age. 

Stendhal<====>26773<====>Stendhal  Marie-Henri Beyle ( ; 23 January 1783 – 23 March 1842), better known by his pen name Stendhal (  or  ;  in English  ,   ,  or   ), was a 19th-century French writer.  Best known for the novels Le Rouge et le Noir (The Red and the Black, 1830) and La Chartreuse de Parme (The Charterhouse of Parma, 1839), he is highly regarded for the acute analysis of his characters' psychology and considered one of the earliest and foremost practitioners of realism. LifeBorn in Grenoble, Isère, he was an unhappy child, disliking his "unimaginative" father and mourning his mother, whom he passionately loved, and who died when he was seven. 

Syndicalism<====>26775<====>Syndicalism  Syndicalism is a proposed type of economic system, considered a replacement for capitalism.  It suggests that workers, industries, and organisations be systematized into confederations or syndicates.  It is ". . . a system of economic organization in which industries are owned and managed by the workers. " Its theory and practice is the advocacy of multiple cooperative productive units composed of specialists and representatives of workers in each field to negotiate and manage the economy.  For adherents, labour unions and labour training (see below) are the potential means of both overcoming economic aristocracy and running society in the interest of informed and skilled majorities, through union democracy. 

Soviet Union<====>26779<====>Soviet Union    The Soviet Union ( ), officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( ), abbreviated as USSR ( ), was a socialist state in Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991.  Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics,  its government and economy were highly centralized.  The country was a one-party state, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.  The Russian nation had constitutionally equal status among the many nations of the union but exerted de facto dominance in various respects. 

Social science<====>26781<====>Social science   Social science is a major category of academic disciplines, concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society.  It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered a social science.  The social sciences include, but are not limited to, economics, political science, human geography, demography, management, psychology, sociology, anthropology, archaeology, jurisprudence, history, and linguistics.  The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society', established in the 19th century.   A more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences can be found at Outline of social science. 

Statute<====>26783<====>Statute  A statute is a formal written enactment of a legislative authority that governs a  state,  city or country.Typically, statutes command or prohibit something, or declare policy.   Statutes are rules made by legislative bodies; they are distinguished from case law or precedent, which is decided by courts, and regulations issued by government agencies.  Publication and organizationIn virtually all countries, newly enacted statutes are published in some kind of journal, gazette, or chronological compilation, which is then distributed so that everyone can look up the statutory law. A universal problem encountered by lawmakers throughout human history is how to organize published statutes. 

Statutory law<====>26784<====>Statutory law Statutory law or statute law is written law set down by a body of legislature or by a singular legislator (in the case of absolute monarchy).   This is as opposed to oral or customary law; or regulatory law promulgated by the executive or common law of the judiciary.  Statutes may originate with national, state legislatures or local municipalities. Codified law The term codified law refers to statutes that have been organized ("codified") by subject matter; in this narrower sense, some but not all statutes are considered "codified. "  The entire body of codified statute is referred to as a "code," such as the United States Code, the Ohio Revised Code or the Code of Canon Law. 

Sarajevo<====>26786<====>Sarajevo  Sarajevo ( ,  ; see names in other languages) is the capital   and largest city of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a population of 275,524 in its current administrative limits.    The Sarajevo metropolitan area, including Sarajevo Canton, East Sarajevo and nearby municipalities is home to 555,210 inhabitants.  Nestled within the greater Sarajevo valley of Bosnia, it is surrounded by the Dinaric Alps and situated along the Miljacka River in the heart of Southeastern Europe and the Balkans. Sarajevo is the leading political, social and cultural center of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a prominent center of culture in the Balkans, with its region-wide influence in entertainment, media, fashion, and the arts. 

Science fiction<====>26787<====>Science fiction    Science fiction (often shortened to SF or sci-fi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life.  Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a "literature of ideas".   It usually avoids the supernatural, unlike the related genre of fantasy.  Historically, science-fiction stories have had a grounding in actual science, but now this is only expected of hard science fiction. Definitions Science fiction is difficult to define, as it includes a wide range of subgenres and themes. 

Spirotrich<====>26788<====>Spirotrich  The spirotrichs are a large and distinctive group of ciliate protozoa.   They typically have prominent oral cilia in the form of a series of polykinetids, called the adoral zone of membranelles, beginning anterior to the oral cavity and running down to the left side of the mouth.   There may also be one or two paroral membranes on its right side.   The body cilia are fused to form polykinetids called cirri in some, and are sparse to absent in others. Forms with cirri are common throughout soil, freshwater, and marine environments.   Individuals tend to be flattened, with cirri confined to the ventral surface. 

Sexual selection<====>26789<====>Sexual selection   Sexual selection is a mode of natural selection where members of one biological sex choose mates of the other sex to mate with (intersexual selection), and compete with members of the same sex for access to members of the opposite sex (intrasexual selection).  These two forms of selection mean that some individuals have better reproductive success than others within a population, either from being more attractive or preferring more attractive partners to produce offspring. For instance in the breeding season sexual selection in frogs occurs with the males first gathering at the water's edge and making their mating calls: croaking. 

Stanisław Lem<====>26790<====>Stanisław Lem   Stanisław Herman    Lem ( ; 12 or 13 September 1921 – 27 March 2006) was a Polish writer of science fiction, philosophy, and satire, and a trained physician.  Lem's books have been translated into 41 languages and have sold over 45 million copies.From the 1950s to 2000s, he published many books, both science fiction and philosophical/futurological.  He is best known as the author of the 1961 novel Solaris, which has been made into a feature film three times.  In 1976, Theodore Sturgeon wrote that Lem was the most widely read science fiction writer in the world. 

Satire<====>26791<====>Satire  Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement.    Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society. A feature of satire is strong irony or sarcasm—"in satire, irony is militant" —but parody, burlesque, exaggeration,  juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and double entendre are all frequently used in satirical speech and writing. 

Samuel Butler (poet)<====>26792<====>Samuel Butler (poet)    Samuel Butler  (baptized 14 February 1613 – 25 September 1680) was a poet and satirist.  He is remembered now chiefly for a long satirical poem titled Hudibras. BiographySamuel Butler was born in Strensham, Worcestershire, and was the son of a farmer and churchwarden, also named Samuel.  His date of birth is unknown, but there is documentary evidence for the date of his baptism of 14 February.The date of Butler's baptism is given as 8 February by Treadway Russell Nash in his 1793 edition of Hudibras.  Nash had already mentioned Butler in his Collections for a History of Worcestershire (1781), and perhaps because the latter date seemed to be a revised account, it has been repeated by many writers and editors. 

List of science fiction and fantasy artists<====>26794<====>List of science fiction and fantasy artists This is a list of science fiction and fantasy artists, 20th- and 21st-century artists who have created book covers or interior illustrations for books, or who have published their own books or comic books of fantastic art with science fiction or fantasy themes.  Artists known exclusively for their work in comic books are not included.  Many of the artists are known for their work in both the fantasy and sf fields.  Artists who have won the Hugo Award, the World Fantasy Award, or the Chesley Award are noted, as are inductees into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame. 

Saxophone<====>26795<====>Saxophone    The saxophone (also referred to as the sax) is a family of woodwind instruments.  Saxophones are usually made of brass and played with a single-reed mouthpiece similar to that of the clarinet.Like the clarinet, saxophones have holes in the instrument which the player closes using a system of key mechanisms.  When the player presses a key, a pad either covers a hole or lifts off a hole, lowering or raising the pitch, respectively. The saxophone family was invented by the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax in 1840.    Adolphe Sax wanted to create a group or series of instruments that would be the most powerful and vocal of the woodwinds, and the most adaptive of the brass instruments, that would fill the vacant middle ground between the two sections. 

Sackbut<====>26797<====>Sackbut ]A sackbut is a type of trombone from the Renaissance and Baroque eras, characterised by a telescopic slide that is used to vary the length of the tube to change pitch.  Unlike the earlier slide trumpet from which it evolved, the sackbut possesses a U-shaped slide, with two parallel sliding tubes, which allows for playing scales in a lower range. Records of the term "trombone" predates the term "sackbut" by two decades, and evidence for the German term "Posaune" is even older.  Timeline of trombone history (15th century), Will Kimball  "Sackbut", originally a French term, was used in England until the instrument fell into disuse in the 1700s; when it returned, the Italian term "trombone" became dominant. 

Saxhorn<====>26798<====>Saxhorn  The saxhorn  is a family of valved brass instruments that have conical bores and deep cup-shaped mouthpieces.  The saxhorn family was developed by Adolphe Sax, who is also known for creating the saxophone family.  The sound of the saxhorn has a characteristic mellow tone quality and blends well with other brass. The saxhorn familyThe saxhorns form a family of seven brass instruments (although at one point ten different sizes seem to have existed).  Designed for band use, they are pitched alternately in E  and B , like the saxophone group.   Modern saxhorns still manufactured and in use:B  soprano saxhorn: flugelhorn E  alto/tenor saxhorn: alto/tenor hornB  baritone saxhorn: baritone horn or euphoniumThe B  bass, E  bass, and B  contrabass saxhorns are basically the same as the modern tuba, E  bass tuba, and BB  contrabass tuba, respectively. 

Sonic Team<====>26800<====>Sonic Team    is a Japanese video game development division of Sega.  The division was established as Sega AM8 in Ōta, Tokyo, Japan in 1988, and was renamed to Sonic Team in 1991 after the release of Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Genesis home console.  The game was a huge commercial success for Sega, and started the long-running Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.  In the mid 1990s, the studio began to create and develop new intellectual properties, whilst continuing to oversee production on the Sonic series. Following the release of Sonic Adventure in 1998, some staff of Sonic Team moved to the United States to form Sonic Team USA. 

Sex<====>26805<====>SexOrganisms of many species are specialized into male and female varieties, each known as a sex,  with some falling in between being intersex.  Sexual reproduction involves the combining and mixing of genetic traits: specialized cells known as gametes combine to form offspring that inherit traits from each parent.  Gametes can be identical in form and function (known as isogamy), but in many cases an asymmetry has evolved such that two sex-specific types of gametes (heterogametes) exist (known as anisogamy). Among humans and other mammals, males typically carry XY chromosomes, whereas females typically carry XX chromosomes, which are a part of the XY sex-determination system. 

Star<====>26808<====>Star   A star is type of astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity.  The nearest star to Earth is the Sun.  Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth.  Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names.  Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations.

Skepticism<====>26810<====>Skepticism  Skepticism (American English) or scepticism (British English; see spelling differences) is generally any questioning attitude or doubt towards one or more items of putative knowledge or belief.    It is often directed at domains, such as the supernatural, morality (moral skepticism), religion (skepticism about the existence of God), or knowledge (skepticism about the possibility of knowledge, or of certainty).   Formally, skepticism as a topic occurs in the context of philosophy, particularly epistemology, although it can be applied to any topic such as politics, religion, and pseudoscience. Philosophical skepticism comes in various forms.  Radical forms of skepticism deny that knowledge or rational belief is possible and urge us to suspend judgment on many or all controversial matters. 

Stagflation<====>26818<====>Stagflation  In economics, stagflation, a portmanteau of stagnation and inflation, is a situation in which the inflation rate is high, the economic growth rate slows, and unemployment remains steadily high.  It raises a dilemma for economic policy, since actions designed to lower inflation may exacerbate unemployment, and vice versa.  The term is generally attributed to Iain Macleod, a British Conservative Party politician who became chancellor of the exchequer in 1970 and coined the phrase in his speech to Parliament in 1965.Introduction, page 9.John Maynard Keynes did not use the term, but some of his work refers to the conditions that most would recognise as stagflation. 

Soundness<====>26819<====>SoundnessIn mathematical logic, a logical system has the soundness property if and only if every formula that can be proved in the system is logically valid with respect to the semantics of the system. The converse of soundness is known as completeness.   In most cases, this comes down to its rules having the property of preserving truth. FormulaSoundness is notated as:If  A1, A2, . . .  An \vdashC   then  A1, A2, . . .  \models C , where  \vdash  means derivation,  \models  means tautological entailment. Validation vs.  soundnessAn argument is sound if and only if1. 

Syllabary<====>26820<====>Syllabary A syllabary is a set of written symbols that represent the syllables or (more frequently) moras which make up words.  A symbol in a syllabary, called a syllabogram, typically represents an (optional) consonant sound (simple onset) followed by a vowel sound (nucleus)—that is, a CV or V syllable—but other phonographic mappings such as CVC, CV- tone, and C (normally nasals at the end of syllables) are also found in syllabaries. Types A writing system using a syllabary is complete when it covers all syllables in the corresponding spoken language without requiring complex orthographic / graphemic rules, like implicit codas (  ⇒ /C 1 VC 2 /) silent vowels (  ⇒ /C 1 V 1 C 2 /) or echo vowels (  ⇒ /C 1 V 1 C 2 /). 

Steve Reich<====>26822<====>Steve Reich   Stephen Michael Reich (   or  ;  born October 3, 1936) is an American composer who, along with La Monte Young, Terry Riley, and Philip Glass, pioneered minimal music in the mid to late 1960s.  Mertens, W.  (1983), American Minimal Music, Kahn & Averill, London, (p. 11).    Reich's style of composition influenced many composers and groups.  His innovations include using tape loops to create phasing patterns (for example, his early compositions It's Gonna Rain and Come Out), and the use of simple, audible processes to explore musical concepts (for instance, Pendulum Music and Four Organs). 

Simon & Garfunkel<====>26823<====>Simon & Garfunkel  Simon & Garfunkel was an American folk rock duo consisting of singer-songwriter Paul Simon and singer Art Garfunkel.  They were one of the best-selling music groups of the 1960s and became counterculture icons of the decade's social revolution, alongside artists such as the Beatles, the Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan.  Their biggest hits—including "The Sound of Silence" (1964), "Mrs.  Robinson" (1968), "The Boxer" (1969), and "Bridge over Troubled Water" (1970)—reached number one on singles charts worldwide. Their often rocky relationship led to artistic disagreements, which resulted in their breakup in 1970.  Their final studio record, Bridge over Troubled Water (released in January of that year), was their most successful, becoming one of the world's best-selling albums.

Sodium<====>26826<====>Sodium   Sodium is a chemical element with symbol Na (from Latin natrium) and atomic number 11.  It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive metal.  Sodium is an alkali metal, being in group 1 of the periodic table, because it has a single electron in its outer shell that it readily donates, creating a positively charged ion—the Na +  cation.  Its only stable isotope is  23 Na.  The free metal does not occur in nature, but must be prepared from compounds.  Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite and rock salt (NaCl). 

Suriname<====>26828<====>Suriname Suriname ( ,   or  , also spelled Surinam), officially known as the Republic of Suriname (   ), is a sovereign state on the northeastern Atlantic coast of South America.

Suriname has a population of approximately  ,  most of whom live on the country's north coast, in and around the capital and largest city, Paramaribo. 

Category of sets<====>26829<====>Category of setsIn the mathematical field of category theory, the category of sets, denoted as Set, is the category whose objects are sets.   The arrows or morphisms between sets A and B are all triples (f, A, B) where f is a function from A to B. Many other categories (such as the category of groups, with group homomorphisms as arrows) add structure to the objects of the category of sets and/or restrict the arrows to functions of a particular kind. Properties of the category of setsThe epimorphisms in Set are the surjective maps, the monomorphisms are the injective maps, and the isomorphisms are the bijective maps.

Scientific method<====>26833<====>Scientific method The scientific method is a body of techniques for investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge.To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry is commonly based on empirical or measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning.   The Oxford Dictionaries Online defines the scientific method as "a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses".   Experiments are a procedure designed to test hypotheses. 

Shotgun<====>26838<====>Shotgun   A shotgun (also known as a scattergun,  or historically as a fowling piece) is a firearm that is usually designed to be fired from the shoulder, which uses the energy of a fixed shell to fire a number of small spherical pellets called shot, or a solid projectile called a slug.  Shotguns come in a wide variety of sizes, ranging from 5. 5 mm (. 22 inch) bore up to   bore, and in a range of firearm operating mechanisms, including breech loading, single-barreled, double or combination gun, pump-action, bolt-, and lever-action, semi-automatic, and even fully automatic variants.

Synergy<====>26859<====>Synergy   Synergy is the creation of a whole that is greater than the simple sum of its parts.   The term synergy comes from the Attic Greek word συνεργία    from  ,  , meaning "working together". HistoryThe words "synergy" and "synergetic" have been used in the field of physiology since at least the middle of the 19th century: SYN'ERGY, Synergi'a, Synenergi'a, (F. ) Synergie; from συν, 'with,' and εργον, 'work. ' A correlation or concourse of action between different organs in health; and, according to some, in disease. —Dunglison, Robley Medical Lexicon Blanchard and Lea, 1853 In 1896, Henri Mazel applied the term "synergy" to social psychology by writing La synergie sociale, in which he argued that Darwinian theory failed to account for "social synergy" or "social love", a collective evolutionary drive. 

Syntax<====>26860<====>Syntax   In linguistics, syntax (   ) is the set of rules, principles, and processes that govern the structure of sentences in a given language, specifically word order and punctuation.  The term syntax is also used  to refer to the study of such principles and processes.The goal of many syntacticians is to discover the syntactic rules common to all languages. In mathematics, syntax refers to the rules governing the behavior of mathematical systems, such as formal languages used in logic.  (See logical syntax. )EtymologyThe word syntax comes from Ancient Greek:   "coordination", which consists of   syn, "together," and   táxis, "an ordering". 

Shamanism<====>26861<====>Shamanism  Shamanism is a practice that involves a practitioner reaching altered states of consciousness in order to perceive and interact with a spirit world and channel these transcendental energies into this world.  A shaman (    or    ) is someone who is regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of benevolent and malevolent spirits, who typically enters into a trance state during a ritual, and practices divination and healing.   The word "shaman" probably originates from the Tungusic Evenki language of North Asia.  According to ethnolinguist Juha Janhunen, "the word is attested in all of the Tungusic idioms" such as Negidal, Lamut, Udehe/Orochi, Nanai, Ilcha, Orok, Manchu and Ulcha, and "nothing seems to contradict the assumption that the meaning 'shaman' also derives from Proto-Tungusic" and may have roots that extend back in time at least two millennia. 

Sexology<====>26862<====>SexologySexology is the scientific study of human sexuality, including human sexual interests, behaviors and functions.   The term sexology does not generally refer to the non-scientific study of sexuality, such as political science or social criticism.   Sexologists apply tools from several academic fields, such as biology, medicine, psychology, epidemiology, sociology, and criminology.  Topics of study include sexual development (puberty), sexual orientation, gender identity, sexual relationships, sexual activities, paraphilias, atypical sexual interests.   It also includes the study of sexuality across the lifespan, including child sexuality, puberty, adolescent sexuality, and sexuality among the elderly.  Sexology also spans sexuality among the mentally and/or physically disabled. 

List of leaders of the Soviet Union<====>26865<====>List of leaders of the Soviet Union Under the 1977 Constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was the head of government  and the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet was the head of state.   The office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was comparable to a prime minister in the First World,  whereas the office of the Chairman of the Presidium was comparable to a president in the First World.   In the Soviet Union's seventy-year history there was no official leader of the Soviet Union office, but during most of that era there was a de facto top leader who usually led the country through the office of the Premier or the office of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).
