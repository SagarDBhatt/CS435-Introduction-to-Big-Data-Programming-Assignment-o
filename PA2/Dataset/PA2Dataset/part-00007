Sodium cyanide<====>52778<====>Sodium cyanide Sodium cyanide is an inorganic compound with the formula NaCN.  It is a white, water-soluble solid.  Cyanide has a high affinity for metals, which leads to the high toxicity of this salt.  Its main application, in gold mining, also exploits its high reactivity toward metals.  When treated with acid, it forms the toxic gas hydrogen cyanide:NaCN + H 2 SO 4   →  HCN +  NaHSO 4 Production and chemical propertiesSodium cyanide is produced by treating hydrogen cyanide with sodium hydroxide: Andreas Rubo, Raf Kellens, Jay Reddy, Norbert Steier, Wolfgang Hasenpusch "Alkali Metal Cyanides" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2006 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany.

The group consists of Bono (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), the Edge (lead guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen Jr.  (drums and percussion).   Initially rooted in post-punk, U2's musical style evolved throughout their career, yet has maintained an anthemic sound built on Bono's expressive vocals and the Edge's effects-based guitar textures.  Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal and sociopolitical themes.  Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several ambitious and elaborate tours over their career. 

Β-lactam antibiotic<====>52784<====>Β-lactam antibioticDISPLAYTITLE β-lactam antibiotics (beta-lactam antibiotics) are a class of broad-spectrum antibiotics, consisting of all antibiotic agents that contain a beta-lactam ring in their molecular structures.  This includes penicillin derivatives (penams), cephalosporins (cephems), monobactams, and carbapenems.Most β-lactam antibiotics work by inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis in the bacterial organism and are the most widely used group of antibiotics.  Until 2003, when measured by sales, more than half of all commercially available antibiotics in use were β-lactam compounds.  Bacteria often develop resistance to β-lactam antibiotics by synthesizing a β-lactamase, an enzyme that attacks the β-lactam ring. 

Local government<====>52786<====>Local government  A local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state.  The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states.  Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government.  In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. 

Androgen insensitivity syndrome<====>52789<====>Androgen insensitivity syndrome Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is an intersex condition in which there is a partial or complete inability of many cells in the affected genetic male to respond to androgenic hormones. This can prevent or impair the masculinization of male genitalia in the developing genetic male (chromosomal XY) fetus, as well as the development of male secondary sexual characteristics at puberty.    Clinical phenotypes range from a normal male habitus with mild spermatogenic defect or reduced secondary terminal hair; to a full female habitus despite the presence of a Y-chromosome.   Women (chromosomal XX) who are heterozygous for the AR gene have normal primary and secondary sexual characteristics; this female carrier will pass the affected AR gene to any child she has with 50% likelihood.

The International musical festival Svyatoslav Richter's December nights has been held in the Pushkin museum since 1981. EtymologyThe museum's current name is somewhat misleading, in that it has no direct associations with the famous Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, other than as a posthumous commemoration of his name and fame.  The facility was founded by professor Ivan Tsvetaev (father of the poet Marina Tsvetaeva). 

Digital camera<====>52797<====>Digital camera A digital camera or digicam is a camera that captures photographs in digital memory.  Most cameras produced today are digital,  and while there are still dedicated compact cameras on the market, the use of dedicated digital cameras is dwindling, as digital cameras are now incorporated into many devices ranging from mobile devices to vehicles.   However, expensive, high-end, high-definition dedicated cameras are still commonly used by professionals. Digital and movie cameras share an optical system, typically using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image pickup device.   The diaphragm and shutter admit the correct amount of light to the imager, just as with film but the image pickup device is electronic rather than chemical. 

John Bellairs<====>52799<====>John Bellairs   John Anthony Bellairs (January 17, 1938 – March 8, 1991) was an American author, best known for his fantasy novel The Face in the Frost and many gothic mystery novels for young adults featuring the characters Lewis Barnavelt, Anthony Monday, and Johnny Dixon.

Survivor: Marquesas<====>52801<====>Survivor: Marquesas Survivor: Marquesas is the fourth season of the American CBS competitive reality television series Survivor.  The season filmed from November 12, 2001 through December 20, 2001 and premiered on February 28, 2002.  Hosted by Jeff Probst, it consisted of the usual 39 days of gameplay with 16 competitors.  The Marquesas Islands were initially selected as a backup location for Survivor.  The original location, Jordan, was discounted as a result of the September 11 attacks    and the political situation in the Middle East.    The contestants were divided into two tribes: Maraamu and Rotu (Marquesan for 'Wind' and 'Rain', respectively). 

The Hunchback of Notre-Dame<====>52803<====>The Hunchback of Notre-Dame  The Hunchback of Notre-Dame ( , "Our Lady of Paris") is a French Romantic/Gothic novel by Victor Hugo, published in 1831.  The original French title refers to Notre Dame Cathedral, on which the story is centered.  English translator Frederic Shoberl named the novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame in 1833 because at the time, Gothic novels were more popular than Romance novels in England.   The story is set in Paris, France in the Late Middle Ages, during the reign of Louis XI. BackgroundVictor Hugo began writing Notre-Dame de Paris in 1829, largely to make his contemporaries more aware of the value of the Gothic architecture, which was neglected and often destroyed to be replaced by new buildings or defaced by replacement of parts of buildings in a newer style. 

Trivial File Transfer Protocol<====>52806<====>Trivial File Transfer Protocol Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple lockstep File Transfer Protocol which allows a client to get a file from or put a file onto a remote host.  One of its primary uses is in the early stages of nodes booting from a local area network.  TFTP has been used for this application because it is very simple to implement. TFTP was first standardized in 1981  and the current specification for the protocol can be found in RFC 1350. OverviewDue to its simple design, TFTP can be easily implemented by small footprint code. 

Humidity<====>52812<====>Humidity    Humidity  is the amount of water vapor present in the air.  Water vapor is the gaseous state of water and is invisible to the human eye.   Humidity indicates the likelihood of precipitation, dew, or fog.   Higher humidity reduces the effectiveness of sweating in cooling the body by reducing the rate of evaporation of moisture from the skin.   This effect is calculated in a heat index table or humidex.  The amount of water vapor that is needed to achieve saturation increases as the temperature increases.  As the temperature of a parcel of water becomes lower it will eventually reach the point of saturation without adding or losing water mass. 

Dialectic<====>52813<====>Dialectic  Dialectic or dialectics ( , dialektikḗ; related to dialogue), also known as the dialectical method, is at base a discourse between two or more people holding different points of view about a subject but wishing to establish the truth through reasoned arguments.  Dialectic resembles debate, but shorn of subjective elements such as emotional appeal and the modern pejorative sense of rhetoric   It may be contrasted with the didactic method where one side of the conversation teaches the other. Within Hegelianism, dialectic acquires a specialised meaning of a contradiction of ideas that serves as the determining factor in their interaction; comprising three stages of development: a thesis, giving rise to its reaction; an antithesis, which contradicts or negates the thesis; and the tension between the two being resolved by means of a synthesis.

Orange juice<====>52824<====>Orange juiceOrange juice is the liquid extract of the fruit of the orange tree, produced by squeezing oranges.  It comes in several different varieties, including blood orange, navel oranges, valencia orange, clementine, and tangerine.  As well as variations in oranges used, some varieties include differing amounts of juice vesicles, known as "pulp" in American English, and "juicy bits" in British English.  These vesicles contain the juice of the orange and can be left in or removed during the manufacturing process.  How juicy these vesicles are depend upon many factors, such as species, variety, and season.

Volumetric heat capacity<====>52827<====>Volumetric heat capacityFor a table of volumetric heat capacities, see Heat capacity. Volumetric heat capacity (VHC), also termed volume-specific heat capacity, describes the ability of a given volume of a substance to store internal energy while undergoing a given temperature change, but without undergoing a phase transition.  It is different from specific heat capacity in that the VHC is a 'per unit volume' measure of the relationship between thermal energy and temperature of a material, while the specific heat is a 'per unit mass' measure (or occasionally per molar quantity of the material).  If given a specific heat value of a substance, one can convert it to the VHC by multiplying the specific heat by the density of the substance. 

Lindsay Davenport<====>52828<====>Lindsay Davenport  Lindsay Ann Davenport Leach (born June 8, 1976) is an American former professional tennis player.

Charon (moon)<====>52838<====>Charon (moon)  Charon, also known as (134340) Pluto I, is the largest of the five known natural satellites of the dwarf planet Pluto.  It was discovered in 1978 at the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D. C. , using photographic plates taken at the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS).  With half the diameter and one eighth the mass of Pluto, it is a very large moon in comparison to its parent body.  Its gravitational influence is such that the barycenter of the Pluto–Charon system lies outside Pluto.  In September 2016, astronomers announced that the reddish-brown cap of the north pole of Charon is composed of tholins, organic macromolecules that may be essential ingredients of life, and produced from methane, nitrogen and related gases released from the atmosphere of Pluto and transferred over about   distance to the orbiting moon. 

Kirkwood gap<====>52839<====>Kirkwood gapA Kirkwood gap is a gap or dip in the distribution of the semi-major axes (or equivalently of the orbital periods) of the orbits of main-belt asteroids.  They correspond to the locations of orbital resonances with Jupiter. For example, there are very few asteroids with semimajor axis near 2. 50 AU, period 3. 95 years, which would make three orbits for each orbit of Jupiter (hence, called the 3:1 orbital resonance).  Other orbital resonances correspond to orbital periods whose lengths are simple fractions of Jupiter's.  The weaker resonances lead only to a depletion of asteroids, while spikes in the histogram are often due to the presence of a prominent asteroid family (see List of asteroid families). 

Tom Swift<====>52840<====>Tom Swift Tom Swift is the main character of five series of American juvenile science fiction and adventure novels that emphasize science, invention and technology.   First published in 1910, the series total more than 100 volumes.  The character was created by Edward Stratemeyer, the founder of the Stratemeyer Syndicate, a book-packaging firm.  Tom's adventures have been written by various ghostwriters, beginning with Howard Garis.  Most of the books are credited to the collective pseudonym "Victor Appleton".   The 33 volumes of the second series use the pseudonym Victor Appleton II for the author.  For this series, and some of the later series, the main character is "Tom Swift, Jr.

Children's literature<====>52847<====>Children's literature   Children's literature or juvenile literature includes stories, books, magazines, and poems that are enjoyed by children.  Modern children's literature is classified in two different ways: genre or the intended age of the reader. Children's literature can be traced to stories and songs, part of a wider oral tradition, that adults shared with children before publishing existed.  The development of early children's literature, before printing was invented, is difficult to trace.  Even after printing became widespread, many classic "children's" tales were originally created for adults and later adapted for a younger audience.  Since the 15th century, a large quantity of literature, often with a moral or religious message, has been aimed specifically at children. 

1975 Australian constitutional crisis<====>52851<====>1975 Australian constitutional crisis    The 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, also known simply as the Dismissal, has been described as the greatest political and constitutional crisis in Australian history.  It culminated on 11 November 1975 with the dismissal from office of the Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, who then commissioned the Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Fraser of the Liberal Party, as caretaker Prime Minister.

Pseudopodia<====>52859<====>Pseudopodia  A pseudopod or pseudopodium (plural: pseudopods or pseudopodia) (from the Greek word ψευδοποδός, ψευδός "false" + ποδός "foot") is a temporary cytoplasm-filled projection of a eukaryotic cell membrane or a unicellular protist.  Pseudopods may be used for motility, or for ingesting nutrients or other particulate matter.  Cells that make pseudopods are generally referred to as amoeboids.  Pseudopods extend and contract by the reversible assembly of actin subunits into many microfilaments.  Filaments near the cell's end interact with myosin which causes contraction.  The pseudopod extends itself until the actin reassembles itself into a network. 

Seasoning<====>52863<====>Seasoning Seasoning is the process of adding salt, herbs, or spices to food to enhance the flavor.  General meaningSeasonings include herbs and spices, which are themselves frequently referred to as "seasonings".   However, Larousse Gastronomique states that "to season and to flavour are not the same thing", insisting that seasoning includes a large or small amount of salt being added to a preparation.  Larousse Gastronomique (1961), Crown Publishers (Translated from the French, Librairie Larousse, Paris (1938))  Salt may be used to draw out water, or to magnify a natural flavor of a food making it richer or more delicate, depending on the dish. 

Marination<====>52864<====>MarinationMarination is the process of soaking foods in a seasoned, often acidic, liquid before cooking.  The origin of the word alludes to the use of brine (aqua marina) in the pickling process, which led to the technique of adding flavor by immersion in liquid.  The liquid in question, the 'marinade', can be either acidic (made with ingredients such as vinegar, lemon juice, or wine) or enzymatic (made with ingredients such as pineapple, papaya or ginger).In addition to these ingredients, a marinade often contains oils, herbs, and spices to further flavor the food items. 

Brining<====>52865<====>BriningIn food processing,  brining is treating of food with brine, a mixture of water and salt used to preserve or season the food.  Brining can be applied to vegetables, cheeses and fruit in a process known as pickling.  Meat and fish are steeped in brine for shorter periods of time, as a form of marination, enhancing its tenderness and flavor, or to enhance shelf period.  Depending on desired effects, clear brine may be flavored with spices, caramel, vinegar. Vegetables Pickled vegetables are immersed in brine, vinegar or vinaigrette for extended periods of time, where they undergo anaerobic fermentation which affects their texture and flavor. 

Cooking weights and measures<====>52866<====>Cooking weights and measuresIn recipes, quantities of ingredients may be specified by mass (commonly called weight), by volume, or by count. For most of history, most cookbooks did not specify quantities precisely, instead talking of "a nice leg of spring lamb", a "cupful" of lentils, a piece of butter "the size of a walnut", and "sufficient" salt.   Informal measurements such as a "pinch", a "drop", or a "hint" (soupçon) continue to be used from time to time.  In the US, Fannie Farmer introduced the more exact specification of quantities by volume in her 1896 Boston Cooking-School Cook Book. 

Xylophone<====>52867<====>Xylophone   The xylophone (from the Greek words  —xylon, "wood"  +  —phōnē, "sound, voice",  meaning "wooden sound") is a musical instrument in the percussion family that consists of wooden bars struck by mallets.  Each bar is an idiophone tuned to a pitch of a musical scale, whether pentatonic or heptatonic in the case of many African and Asian instruments, diatonic in many western children's instruments, or chromatic for orchestral use. The term xylophone may be used generally, to include all such instruments such as the marimba, balafon and even the semantron.  However, in the orchestra, the term xylophone refers specifically to a chromatic instrument of somewhat higher pitch range and drier timbre than the marimba, and these two instruments should not be confused. 

Braising<====>52869<====>Braising   Braising (from the French word braiser) is a combination-cooking method that uses both wet and dry heats: typically, the food is first seared at a high temperature, then finished in a covered pot at a lower temperature while sitting in some (variable) amount of liquid (which may also add flavor).  Braising of meat is often referred to as pot roasting, though some authors make a distinction between the two methods, based on whether additional liquid is added.  MethodBraising relies on heat, time, and moisture to break down the tough connective tissue (collagen) that binds together the muscle fibers collectively called meat, making it an ideal way to cook tougher, more affordable cuts. 

Marimba<====>52871<====>Marimba  The marimba ( ) is a percussion instrument consisting of a set of wooden bars struck with mallets to produce musical tones.  Resonators suspended underneath the bars amplify their sound.   The bars of a chromatic marimba are arranged like the keys of a piano, with the groups of 2 and 3 accidentals raised vertically, overlapping the natural bars to aid the performer both visually and physically.  This instrument is a type of idiophone, but with a more resonant and lower-pitched tessitura than the xylophone. Modern uses of the marimba include solo performances, woodwind and brass ensembles, marimba concertos, jazz ensembles, marching band (front ensembles), drum and bugle corps, and orchestral compositions. 

Vibraphone<====>52872<====>Vibraphone The vibraphone (also known as the vibraharp or simply the vibes) is a musical instrument in the struck idiophone subfamily of the percussion family.  It consists of tuned metal bars, and is usually played by holding two or four soft mallets and striking the bars. The vibraphone resembles the xylophone, marimba, and glockenspiel, one of the main differences between it and these instruments being that each bar is paired with a resonator tube that has a motor-driven butterfly valve at its upper end.  The valves are mounted on a common shaft, which produces a tremolo or vibrato effect while spinning. 

Glockenspiel<====>52873<====>Glockenspiel  A Glockenspiel (  or  , Glocken: bells and Spiel: set) is a percussion instrument composed of a set of tuned keys arranged in the fashion of the keyboard of a piano.   In this way, it is similar to the xylophone; however, the xylophone's bars are made of wood, while the glockenspiel's are metal plates or tubes, thus making it a metallophone.  The glockenspiel, moreover, is usually smaller and higher in pitch.  In German, a carillon is also called a Glockenspiel, while in French, the glockenspiel is often called a carillon.  In music scores the glockenspiel is sometimes designated by the Italian term  . 

People of the Book<====>52874<====>People of the Book   People of the Book (  ′Ahl al-Kitāb) is an Islamic term referring to Jews, Christians, and Sabians and sometimes applied to members of other religions such as Zoroastrians.It is also used in Judaism to refer to the Jewish people and by members of some Christian denominations to refer to themselves.  The Quran uses the term in reference to Jews, Christians and Sabians in a variety of contexts, from religious polemics to passages emphasizing community of faith between those who possess monotheistic scriptures.  The term was later extended to other religious communities that fell under Muslim rule, including even polytheistic Indians. 

Celesta<====>52875<====>Celesta    The celesta   or celeste   is a struck idiophone operated by a keyboard.  It looks similar to an upright piano (four- or five-octave), albeit with smaller keys and a much smaller sized cabinet, or a large wooden music box (three-octave).  The keys connect to hammers that strike a graduated set of metal (usually steel) plates or bars suspended over wooden resonators.  Four- or five-octave models usually have a damper pedal that sustains or damps the sound.  The three-octave instruments do not have a pedal because of their small "table-top" design. 

Gerard Kuiper<====>52881<====>Gerard Kuiper Gerard Peter Kuiper ( ;  ; born Gerrit Pieter Kuiper; December 7, 1905 – December 23, 1973) was a Dutch–American astronomer, planetary scientist, selenographer, author and professor.  He is the eponymous namesake of the Kuiper belt.  Kuiper is considered by many to be the father of modern planetary science.    As professor at the University of Chicago, he was dissertation advisor to Carl Sagan.  In 1958, the two worked on the classified military Project A119, the secret Air Force plan to detonate a nuclear warhead on the Moon. Early lifeKuiper, the son of a tailor in the village of Harenkarspel in North Holland, had an early interest in astronomy. 

Lavon Affair<====>52883<====>Lavon Affair The Lavon affair refers to a failed Israeli covert operation, code named Operation Susannah, conducted in Egypt in the Summer of 1954.   As part of the false flag operation,    a group of Egyptian Jews were recruited by Israeli military intelligence to plant bombs inside Egyptian, American, and British-owned civilian targets, cinemas, libraries and American educational centers.  The bombs were timed to detonate several hours after closing time.  The attacks were to be blamed on the Muslim Brotherhood, Egyptian Communists, "unspecified malcontents" or "local nationalists" with the aim of creating a climate of sufficient violence and instability to induce the British government to retain its occupying troops in Egypt's Suez Canal zone. 

Logo<====>52888<====>Logo A logo (abbreviation of logotype,    from   logos "word" and τύπος typos "imprint") is a graphic mark, emblem, or symbol used to aid and promote public recognition.  It may be of an abstract or figurative design or include the text of the name it represents as in a logotype or wordmark. In the days of hot metal typesetting, a logotype was one word cast as a single piece of type (e. g.  "The" in ATF Garamond, as opposed to a ligature, which is two or more letters joined, but not forming a word). 

Modern pentathlon<====>52892<====>Modern pentathlon Modern Pentathlon is an Olympic sport that comprises five different events; fencing (one-touch épée), swimming (200m freestyle), equestrian show jumping (15 jumps), and a final combined event, now referred to as the Laser-Run.  The Laser-Run alternates four legs of laser pistol shooting followed by an 800m run (3200m in total).  The event is inspired by the traditional pentathlon held during the ancient Olympics; as the original events were patterned on the skills needed by an ideal Greek soldier of the era, the modern pentathlon is similarly patterned on events representing the skills needed by cavalry behind enemy lines. 

French Equatorial Africa<====>52893<====>French Equatorial Africa   French Equatorial Africa ( ), or the AEF, was the federation of French colonial possessions in Equatorial Africa, extending northwards from the Congo River into the Sahel, and comprising what are today the countries of Chad, the Central African Republic, Cameroon, the Republic of the Congo, and Gabon. HistoryEstablished in 1910, the federation contained four (later five) colonial possessions: French Gabon, French Congo, Oubangui-Chari and French Chad.  Following World War I, French Cameroon was added, although it was not organized as a separate entity until 1920.  The Governor-General was based in Brazzaville with deputies in each territory. 

Stone–Čech compactification<====>52897<====>Stone–Čech compactificationIn the mathematical discipline of general topology, Stone–Čech compactification (or Čech–Stone compactification M.  Henriksen, Rings of continuous functions in the 1950s, in Handbook of the History of General Topology, edited by C. E.  Aull, R.  Lowen,Springer Science & Business Media, 2013, p.  246 ) is a technique for constructing a universal  map from a topological space X to a compact Hausdorff space βX.  The Stone–Čech compactification βX of a topological  space X is the largest compact Hausdorff space "generated" by X, in the sense that any map from X to a compact Hausdorff space factors through βX (in a unique way). 

Spread betting<====>52900<====>Spread bettingSpread betting is any of various types of wagering on the outcome of an event where the pay-off is based on the accuracy of the wager, rather than a simple "win or lose" outcome, such as fixed-odds (or money-line) betting or parimutuel betting. A spread is a range of outcomes and the bet is whether the outcome will be above or below the spread.  Spread betting has been a major growth market in the UK in recent years, with the number of gamblers heading towards one million.   Financial spread betting (see below) can carry a high level of risk if there is no "stop". 

Israel Putnam<====>52904<====>Israel Putnam Israel Putnam (January 7, 1718 – May 29, 1790) was an American army general officer, popularly known as Old Put, who fought with distinction at the Battle of Bunker Hill (1775) during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783).  His courage and fighting spirit became known far beyond Connecticut's borders through the circulation of folk legends in the American colonies and states celebrating his exploits. He had previously served notably as an officer with Rogers' Rangers during the French and Indian War, when he was captured by Mohawk warriors.  He was saved from the ritual burning given to enemies by intervention of a French officer, with whom the Mohawk were allied. 

Brunch<====>52906<====>Brunch   Brunch is a combination of breakfast and lunch eaten usually during the late morning to early afternoon, generally served from 11am up to 3pm and regularly has some form of alcoholic drink (most usually champagne or a cocktail) served with it.The word is a portmanteau of breakfast and lunch.   Brunch originated in England in the late 19th century and became popular in the United States in the 1930s.  Origin of the wordThe 1896 supplement to the Oxford English Dictionary cites Punch magazine which wrote that the term was coined in Britain in 1895 to describe a Sunday meal for "Saturday-night carousers" in the writer Guy Beringer's article "Brunch: A Plea"  in Hunter's Weekly  It is sometimes credited to reporter Frank Ward O'Malley who wrote for the New York newspaper The Sun from 1906 until 1919,  allegedly based on the typical mid-day eating habits of a newspaper reporter. 

Nassau County<====>52907<====>Nassau County Nassau County is the name of two counties in the United States:Nassau County, FloridaNassau County, New YorkCounty of Nassau can also refer to:County of Nassau, a former county and state of the Holy Roman Empire ruled by the Counts of Nassau, in modern GermanySee alsoNassau (disambiguation)

Piet Hein Tunnel<====>52909<====>Piet Hein TunnelThe Piet Hein Tunnel ( ) is a 1.9 km long tunnel under lake: IJ_(Amsterdam) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It provides a road link running east-west between the city center and the A10 ring-road, and since May 2005 also provides a tram link between the Amsterdam Centraal railway station and Haveneiland, IJburg. Completed in 1997, the tunnel, approaches and related buildings were designed by the hypermodernist Dutch architectural firm Van Berkel + Bos, and was named after the Dutch naval hero Piet Hein.   

Zuiderzee<====>52910<====>Zuiderzee The Zuiderzee ( ; old spelling Zuyderzee) was a shallow bay of the North Sea in the northwest of the Netherlands, extending about 100 km (60 miles) inland and at most 50 km (30 miles) wide, with an overall depth of about 4 to 5 metres (13–16 feet) and a coastline of about 300 km (200 miles).  It covered  .  Its name means "southern sea" in Dutch, indicating that the name originates in Friesland, to the north of the Zuiderzee (cf.  North Sea).   In the 20th century the majority of the Zuiderzee was closed off from the North Sea by the construction of the Afsluitdijk, leaving the mouth of the inlet to become part of the Wadden Sea. 

Town<====>52911<====>Town  A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city.  The size definition for what constitutes a "town" varies considerably in different parts of the world. Origin and use The word town shares an origin with the German word Zaun, the Dutch word tuin, and the Old Norse tun.  The German word Zaun comes closest to the original meaning of the word: a fence of any material.  An early borrowing from Celtic *dunom (cf.  Old Irish dun, Welsh din "fortress, fortified place, camp," dinas "city"). In English and Dutch, the meaning of the word took on the sense of the space which these fences enclosed. 

Gervasio Antonio de Posadas<====>52912<====>Gervasio Antonio de Posadas  Gervasio Antonio de Posadas y Dávila (18 June 1757, in Buenos Aires – 2 July 1833, in Buenos Aires) was a member of Argentina's Second Triumvirate from 19 August 1813 to 31 January 1814, after which he served as Supreme Director until 9 January 1815. Posadas' early studies were at the convent of San Francisco.  Then he studied and practiced law with Manuel José de Labardén.  In 1789 Posadas was appointed notary general for the bishopric, and held that post until the events of the May Revolution.  He was unaware of the impending revolution and was caught by surprise when the Buenos Aires Cabildo (town hall) was occupied on 25 May 1810; he did not agree that it had been legitimately done. 

Wah-wah (music)<====>52921<====>Wah-wah (music) Wah-wah (or wa-wa) is an imitative word (or onomatopoeia) for the sound of altering the resonance of musical notes to extend expressiveness, sounding much like a human voice saying the syllable wah.   The wah-wah effect is a spectral glide, a "modification of the vowel quality of a tone"  . EtymologyThe word is derived from the sound of the effect itself; an imitative or onomatopoeia word.  The effect's "wa-wa" sound was noted by jazz player Barney Bigard when he heard Tricky Sam Nanton use the effect on his trombone in the early 1920s  .

Marcus Manilius<====>52940<====>Marcus Manilius Marcus Manilius (fl.  1st century AD) was a Roman poet, astrologer, and author of a poem in five books called Astronomica. The Astronomica The author of Astronomica is neither quoted nor mentioned by any ancient writer.  Even his name is uncertain, but it was probably Marcus Manilius; in the earlier books the author is anonymous, the later give Manilius, Manlius, Mallius.  The poem itself implies that the writer lived under Augustus or Tiberius, and that he was a citizen of and resident in Rome.  According to the early 18th century classicist Richard Bentley, he was an Asiatic Greek; according to the 19th-century classicist Fridericus Jacob, an African.

Christopher Wren<====>52946<====>Christopher Wren   Sir Christopher Wren PRS ( ;    –  ) was an English anatomist, astronomer, geometer, and mathematician-physicist, as well as one of the most highly acclaimed English architects in history.  He was accorded responsibility for rebuilding 52 churches in the City of London after the Great Fire in 1666, including what is regarded as his masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral, on Ludgate Hill, completed in 1710. The principal creative responsibility for a number of the churches is now more commonly attributed to others in his office, especially Nicholas Hawksmoor.   Other notable buildings by Wren include the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, and the south front of Hampton Court Palace. 

Hampton Court Palace<====>52947<====>Hampton Court Palace    Hampton Court Palace is a royal palace in the borough of Richmond upon Thames, London, England,south west and upstream of central London on the River Thames.  Building of the palace began in 1515 for Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, a favourite of King Henry VIII.  In 1529, as Wolsey fell from favour, the King seized the palace for himself and later enlarged it.  Along with St James's Palace, it is one of only two surviving palaces out of the many owned by King Henry VIII. In the following century, King William III's massive rebuilding and expansion project, which destroyed much of the Tudor palace, was intended to rival Versailles.

Berries are usually juicy, rounded, brightly colored, sweet or sour, and do not have a stone or pit, although many pips or seeds may be present.   Common examples are strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, red currants, and blackcurrants.   In Britain, soft fruit is a horticultural term for such fruits.The scientific usage of the term "berry" differs from common usage. 

Israelites<====>52949<====>Israelites    The Israelites ( ;   Bnei Yisra'el)  were a confederation of Iron Age Semitic-speaking tribes of the ancient Near East, who inhabited a part of Canaan during the tribal and monarchic periods.  The ancient Israelites are considered to be an outgrowth of the indigenous Canaanite populations that long inhabited the Southern Levant, Syria, ancient Israel and the Transjordan region. In the Hebrew Bible, the term Israelites, also known as the Hebrews and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, refers to the direct descendants of any of the sons of the patriarch Jacob, or to the descendants of the people who are called Israel, and to a worshiper of the God of Israel, Yahweh. 

Adrenoleukodystrophy<====>52952<====>Adrenoleukodystrophy  Adrenoleukodystrophy is a disease linked to the X chromosome.  It is a result of fatty acid buildup caused by the relevant enzymes not functioning properly, which then causes damage to the myelin sheath of the nerves, resulting in seizures and hyperactivity.  Other side effects include problems with speaking, listening, and understanding verbal instructions. In more detail, it is a disorder of peroxisomal fatty acid beta oxidation which results in the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in tissues throughout the body.   The most severely affected tissues are the myelin in the central nervous system, the adrenal cortex, and the Leydig cells in the testes. 

Bell's palsy<====>52957<====>Bell's palsy  Bell's palsy is a type of facial paralysis that results in an inability to control the facial muscles on the affected side.   Symptoms can vary from mild to severe.   They may include muscle twitching, weakness, or total loss of the ability to move one or rarely both sides of the face.   Other symptoms include drooping of the eyelid, a change in taste, pain around the ear, and increased sensitivity to sound.   Typically symptoms come on over 48 hours.The cause of Bell's palsy is unknown. 

Obstetrics and gynaecology<====>52963<====>Obstetrics and gynaecology  Obstetrics and gynecology (commonly known as OB-GYN, OBG, O&G or obs and gynae) is the medical specialty that deals with obstetrics and gynecology.  Postgraduate training programs for both aspects are usually combined, preparing the practicing obstetrician-gynecologist to be adept at the care of female reproductive organs' health and at the management of pregnancy, although many doctors go on to develop subspecialty interests in one field or the other. Education and training (residency)United StatesAfter completing medical school, one must complete a four-year residency program to be eligible to sit for boards. For the ERAS match in 2017, there will be 238 participating programs accepting applicants. 

Obstetrics<====>52965<====>Obstetrics Obstetrics is the field of study concentrated on pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period.  As a medical specialty, obstetrics is combined with gynaecology under the discipline known as obstetrics and gynaecology (OB/GYN) which is a surgical field. Main areasPrenatal carePrenatal care is important in screening for various complications of pregnancy.  This includes routine office visits with physical exams and routine lab tests: Image:Ultrasound_image_of_a_fetus. jpg|3D ultrasound of   foetus (about 14 weeks gestational age)Image:Sucking his thumb and waving. jpg|Foetus at 17 weeksImage:3dultrasound 20 weeks. jpg|Foetus at 20 weeks First trimesterComplete blood count (CBC)Blood typeGeneral antibody screen (indirect Coombs test) for HDNRh D negative antenatal patients should receive RhoGam at 28 weeks to prevent Rh disease. 

Gynaecology<====>52967<====>Gynaecology   Gynaecology or gynecology (see spelling differences) is the medical practice dealing with the health of the female reproductive systems (vagina, uterus, and ovaries) and the breasts.  Outside medicine, the term means "the science of women".   Its counterpart is andrology, which deals with medical issues specific to the male reproductive system. Almost all modern gynaecologists are also obstetricians (see obstetrics and gynaecology).   In many areas, the specialities of gynaecology and obstetrics overlap. EtymologyThe word "gynaecology" comes from the oblique stem (γυναικ-) of Greek γυνή (gyne), "woman", and -logia, "study".  CharlotteHistoryThe Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus, dated to about 1800 BC, deals with women's complaints—gynaecological diseases, fertility, pregnancy, contraception, etc. 

Pete Rose<====>52970<====>Pete Rose    Peter Edward Rose Sr.  (born April 14, 1941), also known by his nickname "Charlie Hustle", is an American former professional baseball player and manager.  Rose played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1963 to 1986, and managed from 1984 to 1989.

Emergency medicine<====>52974<====>Emergency medicine   Emergency medicine, also known as accident and emergency medicine, is the medical specialty concerned with caring for undifferentiated, unscheduled patients with illnesses or injuries requiring immediate medical attention.  In their role as first-line providers, emergency physicians are responsible for initiating resuscitation and stabilization, starting investigations and interventions to diagnose and treat illnesses in the acute phase, coordinating care with specialists, and determining disposition regarding patients' need for hospital admission, observation, or discharge.  Emergency physicians generally practice in hospital emergency departments, pre-hospital settings via emergency medical services, and intensive care units, but may also work in primary care settings such as urgent care clinics. 

Emergency medical services<====>52975<====>Emergency medical servicesEmergency medical services, also known as ambulance services or paramedic services (abbreviated to the initialism EMS, EMAS, EMARS or SAMU in some countries), are a type of emergency service dedicated to providing out-of-hospital acute medical care, transport to definitive care, and other medical transport to patients with illnesses and injuries which prevent the patient from transporting themselves.   Emergency medical services may also be locally known as a paramedic service, a first aid squad,  FAST squad,  emergency squad,  rescue squad,  ambulance squad,  ambulance service,  ambulance corps,  or life squad.  The goal of most emergency medical services is to either provide treatment to those in need of urgent medical care, with the goal of satisfactorily treating the presenting conditions, or arranging for timely removal of the patient to the next point of definitive care. 

Clinical neurophysiology<====>52977<====>Clinical neurophysiology Clinical neurophysiology is a medical specialty that studies the central and peripheral nervous systems through the recording of bioelectrical activity, whether spontaneous or stimulated.  It encompasses both research regarding the pathophysiology along with clinical methods used to diagnose diseases involving both central and peripheral nervous systems.   Examinations in the clinical neurophysiology field are not limited to tests conducted in a laboratory.  It is thought of as an extension of a neurologic consultation.  Tests that are conducted are concerned with measuring the electrical functions of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves in the limbs and muscles. 

Jewish principles of faith<====>52978<====>Jewish principles of faith   There is no established formulation of principles of faith that are recognized by all branches of Judaism.  Central authority in Judaism is not vested in any one person or group - although the Sanhedrin, the supreme Jewish religious court, would fulfill this role when it is re-established - but rather in Judaism's sacred writings, laws, and traditions. The various principles of faith that have been enumerated over the centuries carry no weight other than that imparted to them by the fame and scholarship of their respective authors. Judaism affirms the existence and uniqueness of God and stresses performance of deeds or commandments alongside adherence to a strict belief system. 

Hakka Chinese<====>52980<====>Hakka Chinese Hakka  ,   also rendered Kejia, is one of the major groups of varieties of Chinese, spoken natively by the Hakka people throughout southern China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and throughout the diaspora areas of East Asia, Southeast Asia, and in overseas Chinese around the world. Due to its primary usage in scattered isolated regions where communication is limited to the local area, Hakka has developed numerous varieties or dialects, spoken in different provinces, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Fujian, Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi and Guizhou, as well as in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. 

Deep frying<====>52982<====>Deep frying   Deep frying (also referred to as deep fat frying) is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat, most commonly oil, rather than the shallow oil used in conventional frying, done in a frying pan.  Normally, a deep fryer or chip pan is used for this; industrially, a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer may be used.  Deep frying may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot.   Deep frying is classified as hot-fat cooking method.    Typically, deep frying foods cook quickly: all sides of a food are cooked simultaneously as oil has a high rate of heat conduction. 

Hot salt frying<====>52983<====>Hot salt frying Hot salt frying and hot sand frying are cooking techniques used by street-side food vendors in Pakistan, China and India.Hot salt fryingIn Pakistan, hot salt frying is mostly used by street vendors to cook corn.  Rock salt is preheated in a wok.  Either the whole corn or individual kernels are buried in the salt and occasionally turned. Coarse sea salt is placed in a large wok and heated to a high temperature.  Dry food items, such as eggs in shell, are buried in the hot salt and occasionally turned with a spatula. 

Pan frying<====>52985<====>Pan frying Pan frying is a form of frying characterized by the use of minimal cooking oil or fat (compared to shallow frying or deep frying); typically using just enough oil to lubricate the pan.   In the case of a greasy food such as bacon, no oil or fats may be needed.  As a form of frying, pan frying relies on oil/fat as the heat transfer medium  and on correct temperature and time to not overcook or burn the food.   Pan frying can serve to retain the moisture in foods such as meats such as fish and seafood. 

Sautéing<====>52986<====>SautéingSautéing (  or  ,  ; from the French sauté  , lit.  "jumped, bounced" in reference to tossing while cooking)    is a method of cooking food that uses a small amount of oil or fat in a shallow pan over relatively high heat.  Various sauté methods exist, and sauté pans are a specific type of pan designed for sautéing. OverviewIngredients for sautéing are usually cut into pieces or thinly sliced to facilitate fast cooking.   The primary mode of heat transfer during sautéing is conduction between the pan and the food being cooked. 

Grilling<====>52987<====>Grilling  Grilling is a form of cooking that involves dry heat applied to the surface of food, commonly from above or below.   Grilling usually involves a significant amount of direct, radiant heat, and tends to be used for cooking meat and vegetables quickly.  Food to be grilled is cooked on a grill (an open wire grid such as a gridiron with a heat source above or below), a grill pan (similar to a frying pan, but with raised ridges to mimic the wires of an open grill), or griddle (a flat plate heated from below).    Heat transfer to the food when using a grill is primarily through thermal radiation. 

Poaching (cooking)<====>52988<====>Poaching (cooking) Poaching is a type of moist-heat cooking technique that involves cooking by submerging food in a liquid, such as water, milk, stock or wine.  Poaching is differentiated from the other "moist heat" cooking methods, such as simmering and boiling, in that it uses a relatively low temperature (about  ).    This temperature range makes it particularly suitable for delicate food, such as eggs, poultry, fish and fruit, which might easily fall apart or dry out using other cooking methods.   Poaching is often considered as a healthy method of cooking because it does not use fat to cook or flavor the food. 

Poaching<====>52989<====>Poaching  Poaching has traditionally been defined as the illegal hunting or capturingof wild animals, usually associated with land use rights.  According to Encyclopædia Britannica, poaching was performed by impoverished peasants for subsistence purposes and a supplement for meager diets.Poaching was as well set against the hunting privileges of nobility and territorial rulers.By contrast, stealing domestic animals (as in cattle raiding, for example) classifies as theft, not as poaching.  Since the 1980s, the term "poaching" has also referred to the illegal harvesting of wild plant species. 

Pressure cooking<====>52991<====>Pressure cooking    Pressure cooking is the process of cooking food, using water or other cooking liquid, in a sealed vessel known as a pressure cooker. Pressure is created by boiling a liquid, such as water or broth, inside the closed pressure cooker.  The trapped steam increases the internal pressure and allows the temperature to rise.  After use, the pressure is slowly released so that the vessel can be opened safely. Pressure cooking can be used for quick simulation of the effects of long braising.  Almost any food which can be cooked in steam or water-based liquids can be cooked in a pressure cooker. 

Roasting<====>52993<====>Roasting  Roasting is a cooking method that uses dry heat where hot air envelops the food, cooking it evenly on all sides with temperatures of at least 150 °C (~300 °F) from an open flame, oven, or other heat source.  Roasting can enhance flavor through caramelization and Maillard browning on the surface of the food.  Roasting uses indirect, diffused heat (as in an oven), and is suitable for slower cooking of meat in a larger, whole piece.  Meats and most root and bulb vegetables can be roasted.  Any piece of meat, especially red meat, that has been cooked in this fashion is called a roast. 

Barr body<====>52994<====>Barr body A Barr body (named after discoverer Murray Barr)  is the inactive X chromosome in a female somatic cell,  rendered inactive in a process called lyonization, in those species  in which sex is determined by the presence of the Y (including humans) or W chromosome rather than the diploidy of the X.  The Lyon hypothesis states that in cells with multiple X chromosomes, all but one are inactivated during mammalian embryogenesis.    This happens early in embryonic development at random in mammals, Brown,C. J. , Robinson,W. P. , (1997), XIST Expression and X-Chromosome Inactivation in Human Preimplantation Embryos. 

Smoking (cooking)<====>52995<====>Smoking (cooking)Smoking is the process of flavoring, browning, cooking, or preserving food by exposing it to smoke from burning or smoldering material, most often wood.  meat, fish, and lapsang souchong tea are also smoked. In Europe, alder is the traditional smoking wood, but oak is more often used now, and beech to a lesser extent.   In North America, hickory, mesquite, oak, pecan, alder, maple, and fruit-tree woods, such as apple, cherry, and plum, are commonly used for smoking.  Other biomass besides wood can also be employed, sometimes with the addition of flavoring ingredients.  Chinese tea-smoking uses a mixture of uncooked rice, sugar, and tea, heated at the base of a wok. 

Steaming<====>52996<====>Steaming Steaming is a method of cooking using steam.  This is often done with a food steamer, a kitchen appliance made specifically to cook food with steam, but food can also be steamed in a wok.  In the American southwest, steam pits used for cooking have been found dating back about 5,000 years.  Steaming is considered a healthy cooking technique that can be used for many kinds of food. MethodSteaming works by boiling water continuously, causing it to vaporize into steam; the steam then carries heat to the nearby food, thus cooking the food.  The food is kept separate from the boiling water but has direct contact with the steam, resulting in a moist texture to the food. 

Double steaming<====>52997<====>Double steaming Double steaming, sometimes called double boiling, is a Chinese cooking technique to prepare delicate food such as bird's nest soup and shark fin soup.   The food is covered with water and put in a covered ceramic jar and the jar is then steamed for several hours.   This technique ensures there is no loss of liquid or moisture (its essences) from the food being cooked, hence it is often used with expensive ingredients like Chinese herbal medicines. In Cantonese, double steaming is called dun ( ).  The meaning of the Chinese character for dun in Cantonese is different from that in Mandarin, because dun means to simmer or stew in Mandarin. 

Phobos (moon)<====>52999<====>Phobos (moon)   Phobos (    or    ,  from the Greek  . ) (systematic designation:  ) is the innermost and larger of the two natural satellites of Mars,  the other being Deimos.  Both moons were discovered in 1877 by American astronomer Asaph Hall. Phobos is a small, irregularly shaped object with a mean radius of  ,  and is seven times as massive as the outer moon, Deimos.  Phobos is named after the Greek god Phobos, a son of Ares (Mars) and Aphrodite (Venus), and the personification of horror (cf. 

Stir frying<====>53000<====>Stir frying  Stir frying ( ) is a Chinese cooking technique in which ingredients are fried in a small amount of very hot oil while being stirred in a wok.  The technique originated in China and in recent centuries has spread into other parts of Asia and the West. Scholars think that wok (or pan) frying may have been used as early as the Han dynasty (206 B. C.  – 220 A. D. ) for drying grain, not for cooking, but it was not until the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) that the wok reached its modern shape and allowed quick cooking in hot oil. 

Iridium Communications<====>53008<====>Iridium Communications Iridium Communications Inc.  (formerly Iridium Satellite LLC) is a publicly traded American company headquartered in McLean, Virginia.  Iridium operates the Iridium satellite constellation, a system of 66 active satellites used for worldwide voice and data communication from hand-held satellite phones and other transceiver units.  The Iridium network is unique in that it covers the whole Earth, including poles, oceans and airways, with 95 satellites launched so far.  The satellites are frequently visible in the night sky as satellite flares, a phenomenon typically observed as short-lived bright flashes of light. Iridium manages several operations centers, including Tempe, Arizona and Leesburg, Virginia, United States. 

Poet laureate<====>53011<====>Poet laureate A poet laureate (plural: poets laureate) is a poet officially appointed by a government or conferring institution, who is often expected to compose poems for special events and occasions.   The Italians Albertino Mussato and Francesco Petrarca were the first to be crowned poets laureate after the classical age,  respectively in 1315 and 1342.    In Britain, the term dates from the appointment of Bernard André by Henry VII of England.  In modern times, the title may also be conferred by an organization such as the Poetry Foundation, which has a designated Children's Poet Laureate. 

Chandra Levy<====>53012<====>Chandra Levy   Chandra Ann Levy (April 14, 1977 ––   May 1, 2001) was an American intern at the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Washington, D. C. , who disappeared in May 2001.  She was presumed murdered after her skeletal remains were found in Rock Creek Park in May 2002.  The case attracted attention from the American news media for several years. Due to a miscommunication, the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) failed to follow its own search parameters in Rock Creek Park, leaving Levy's body to decompose for a year.  Furthermore, the MPDC had been informed, and soon dismissed, that Ingmar Guandique, already arrested for attacking women in Rock Creek Park, had confessed to attacking Levy. 

List of Spanish monarchs<====>53014<====>List of Spanish monarchs    This is a list of Spanish monarchs, that is, rulers of the country of Spain in the modern sense of the word.  The forerunners of the monarchs of the Spanish throne were the following:Kings of the VisigothsKings of AsturiasKings of Navarre Kings of LeónKings of GaliciaKings of AragonKings of CastileThese seven lineages were eventually united by the marriage of the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand II of Aragon (king of the Crown of Aragon) and Isabella I of Castile (queen of the Crown of Castile).  Although their kingdoms continued to be separate, with their personal union they ruled them together as one dominion. 

Sturgeon's law<====>53015<====>Sturgeon's lawSturgeon's revelation (as originally expounded by Sturgeon), commonly referred to as Sturgeon's law, is an adage commonly cited as "ninety percent of everything is crap".  It is derived from quotations by Theodore Sturgeon, an American science fiction author and critic; while Sturgeon coined another adage that he termed "Sturgeon's law", it is the "ninety percent crap" remark that is usually referred to by that term. The phrase was derived from Sturgeon's observation that while science fiction was often derided for its low quality by critics, however the majority of examples of works in other fields could equally be seen to be of low quality and that science fiction was thus no different in that regard from other art forms. 

Screenwriter<====>53016<====>Screenwriter A screenplay writer (also called screenwriter for short), scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media, such as films, television programs, comics or video games, are based. ProfessionScreenwriting is a freelance profession.  No education is required to become a professional screenwriter, just good storytelling abilities and imagination.  Screenwriters are not hired employees but contracted freelancers.  Most, if not all, screenwriters start their careers writing on speculation (spec) and so write without being hired or paid for it.  If such a script is sold, it is called a spec script. 

Special effect<====>53017<====>Special effect  Special effects (often abbreviated as SFX,  SPFX, or simply FX) are illusions or visual tricks used in the film, television, theatre, video game and simulator industries to simulate the imagined events in a story or virtual world. Special effects are traditionally divided into the categories of optical effects and mechanical effects.  With the emergence of digital filmmaking a distinction between special effects and visual effects has grown, with the latter referring to digital post-production while "special effects" referring to mechanical and optical effects. Mechanical effects (also called practical or physical effects) are usually accomplished during the live-action shooting. 

Supergroup (music)<====>53027<====>Supergroup (music)A supergroup is a music group whose members are previously successful as solo artists or as part of other groups or well known in other musical professions.  Usually used in the context of rock and pop music, the term has been applied to other musical genres such as opera (The Three Tenors).  Supergroups are sometimes formed as side projects and thus not intended to be permanent, while other times can become the primary project of the members' careers.  It became popular in late 1960s rock music for members of already successful groups to record albums together, after which they normally split up. 

Muammar Gaddafi<====>53029<====>Muammar GaddafiMuammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi  ( ;  ;   20 October 2011), commonly known as Colonel Gaddafi, was a Libyan revolutionary, politician, and political theorist.  He governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman of the Libyan Arab Republic from 1969 to 1977, then as the "Brotherly Leader" of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011.  He was initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, but later came to rule under his own Third International Theory.    Born near Sirte to an impoverished Bedouin family, he became an Arab nationalist while at school in Sabha, later enrolling in the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi. 

Stefan–Boltzmann law<====>53031<====>Stefan–Boltzmann law The Stefan–Boltzmann law describes the power radiated from a black body in terms of its temperature.   Specifically, the Stefan–Boltzmann law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body across all wavelengths per unit time (also known as the black-body radiant emittance or radiant exitance),   j^{\star} , is directly proportional to the fourth power of the black body's thermodynamic temperature T:  j^{\star} = \sigma T^{4}.  The constant of proportionality σ, called the Stefan–Boltzmann constant derives from other known constants of nature.   The value of the constant is \sigma=\frac{2\pi^5 k^4}{15c^2h^3}= 5. 

Josef Stefan<====>53033<====>Josef Stefan  Josef Stefan ( ; 24 March 1835 – 7 January 1893) was an ethnic Carinthian Slovene physicist, mathematician, and poet of the Austrian Empire. Life and workStefan was born in an outskirt village of St.  Peter (Slovene:  ; today a district of Klagenfurt) in the Austrian Empire (now in Austria) to father Aleš (Aleksander) Stefan, born in 1805, and mother Marija Startinik, born 1815.  His parents, both ethnic Slovenes, married when Josef was eleven.  The Stefans were a modest family.  His father was a milling assistant and mother served as a maidservant. 

WebCrawler<====>53034<====>WebCrawler   WebCrawler was a metasearch engine that blends the top search results from Google Search and Yahoo! Search.  WebCrawler also provides users the option to search for images, audio, video, news, yellow pages and white pages.  WebCrawler is a registered trademark of InfoSpace, Inc.  It went live on April 20, 1994 and was created by Brian Pinkerton at the University of Washington.  HistoryWebCrawler was the first Web search engine to provide full text search.  It was bought by America Online on June 1, 1995 and sold to Excite on April 1, 1997.  WebCrawler was acquired by InfoSpace in 2001 after Excite (which was then called Excite@Home) went bankrupt. 

Network address translation<====>53036<====>Network address translationNetwork address translation (NAT) is a method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.    The technique was originally used as a shortcut to avoid the need to readdress every host when a network was moved.  It has become a popular and essential tool in conserving global address space in the face of IPv4 address exhaustion.  One Internet-routable IP address of a NAT gateway can be used for an entire private network.  IP masquerading is a technique that hides an entire IP address space, usually consisting of private IP addresses, behind a single IP address in another, usually public address space. 

Key (cryptography)<====>53039<====>Key (cryptography) In cryptography, a key is a piece of information (a parameter) that determines the functional output of a cryptographic algorithm.  For encryption algorithms, a key specifies the transformation of plaintext into ciphertext, and vice versa for decryption algorithms.  Keys also specify transformations in other cryptographic algorithms, such as digital signature schemes and message authentication codes. Need for secrecyIn designing security systems, it is wise to assume that the details of the cryptographic algorithm are already available to the attacker.  This is known as Kerckhoffs' principle — "only secrecy of the key provides security", or, reformulated as Shannon's maxim, "the enemy knows the system". 

Symmetric-key algorithm<====>53042<====>Symmetric-key algorithmSymmetric-key algorithms  are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both encryption of plaintext and decryption of ciphertext.  The keys may be identical or there may be a simple transformation to go between the two keys .  The keys, in practice, represent a shared secret between two or more parties that can be used to maintain a private information link.   This requirement that both parties have access to the secret key is one of the main drawbacks of symmetric key encryption, in comparison to public-key encryption (also known as asymmetric key encryption). 

Lenin Peak<====>53043<====>Lenin Peak Lenin Peak ( , Lenin Çoqusu, لەنىن چوقۇسۇ;  , Pik Lenina;  , renamed қуллаи Абӯалӣ ибни Сино (qulla‘i Abûalî ibni Sino) in July 2006 Government Resolution No.  297, July 4, 2006, Dushanbe    (Tajik); for Russian text see  .  ), or Ibn Sina (Avicenna) Peak, rises to 7,134 metres (23,406 ft) in Gorno-Badakhshan (GBAO) on the border of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and is the second-highest point of both countries.  It is considered one of the less technical 7000 m peaks in the world to climb and it has by far the most ascents of any 7000 m or higher peak on Earth, with every year seeing hundreds of mountaineers make their way to the summit. 

File Allocation Table<====>53045<====>File Allocation Table    File Allocation Table (FAT) is a computer file system architecture and a family of industry-standard file systems utilizing it.  The FAT file system is a legacy file system which is simple and robust.   It offers good performance even in lightweight implementations, but cannot deliver the same performance, reliability and scalability as some modern file systems.  It is, however, supported for compatibility reasons by nearly all currently developed operating systems for personal computers and many mobile devices and embedded systems, and thus is a well-suited format for data exchange between computers and devices of almost any type and age from 1981  up to the present. 

Joan Collins<====>53047<====>Joan Collins    Dame Joan Henrietta Collins,   (born 23 May 1933) is an English actress, author and columnist.  Born in London, Collins grew up during the Second World War.  After making her stage debut in the Henrik Ibsen play A Doll's House at the age of nine, she trained as an actress at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London.  She then signed an exclusive contract with the Rank Organisation and appeared in various British films. At age 22 in 1955, Collins headed to Hollywood and landed sultry roles in several popular films, including The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing (1955) and Rally Round the Flag, Boys! (1958). 

University of Vienna<====>53049<====>University of Vienna   The University of Vienna ( ) is a public university located in Vienna, Austria.  It was founded by Duke Rudolph IV in 1365 and is one of the oldest universities in the German-speaking world.  With its long and rich history, the University of Vienna has developed into one of the largest universities in Europe, and also one of the most renowned, especially in the Humanities.  It is associated with 15 Nobel prize winners and has been the academic home to a large number of scholars of historical as well as of academic importance. 

Pope Paul IV<====>53050<====>Pope Paul IV   Pope Paul IV, C. R.  ( ; 28 June 1476 – 18 August 1559), born Gian Pietro Carafa, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 23 May 1555 to his death in 1559.    While serving as papal nuncio in Spain, he developed an anti-Spanish outlook that later coloured his papacy, and resulted in the Papal States suffering a serious military defeat in the Italian War of 1551–59. Carafa was appointed bishop of Chieti, but resigned in 1524 in order to found with St. 

Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)<====>53056<====>Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)   The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation (MOI,  , МВД, Ministerstvo Vnutrennikh Del, MVD) is the interior ministry of Russia.  Its predecessor was founded in 1802 by Alexander I in Imperial Russia.  The Ministry is headquartered in Moscow. The current Minister of Internal Affairs is General of Police Vladimir Kolokoltsev, who was the Moscow Police Commissioner between 2009 and 2012. HistoryRussian EmpireCreated by Alexander I on 28 March 1802 in the process of government reforms to replace the aging collegia of Peter the Great, the MVD was one of the most powerful governmental bodies of the Empire, responsible for the police forces and Internal Guards and the supervision of gubernial  administrations. 

Pareto distribution<====>53057<====>Pareto distribution The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian civil engineer, economist, and sociologist Vilfredo Pareto, is a power law probability distribution that is used in description of social, scientific, geophysical, actuarial, and many other types of observable phenomena. DefinitionIf X is a random variable with a Pareto (Type I) distribution,    then the probability that X is greater than some number x, i. e.  the survival function (also called tail function), is given by \overline{F}(x) = \Pr(X>x) = \begin{cases}\left(\frac{x_\mathrm{m}}{x}\right)^\alpha & x\ge x_\mathrm{m}, \\1 & x  where x m  is the (necessarily positive) minimum possible value of X, and α is a positive parameter. 

Regular space<====>53058<====>Regular space In topology and related fields of mathematics, a topological space X is called a regular space if every closed subset C of X and a point p not contained in C admit non-overlapping open neighborhoods.   Thus p and C can be separated by neighborhoods.  This condition is known as Axiom T 3 .  The term "T 3  space" usually means "a regular Hausdorff space".  These conditions are examples of separation axioms. DefinitionsA topological space X is a regular space if, given any closed set F and any point x that does not belong to F, there exists a neighbourhood U of x and a neighbourhood V of F that are disjoint. 

66 BC<====>53062<====>66 BC   Year 66 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Lepidus and Tullus (or, less frequently, year 688 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 66 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events in Rome By placeRoman RepublicConsuls: Manius Aemilius Lepidus and Lucius Volcatius Tullus. Catiline accused of conspiring against the Roman Republic with Autronius and the younger Sulla (also in 63 BC during the consulship of Cicero). 

67 BC<====>53063<====>67 BC   Year 67 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Piso and Glabrio (or, less frequently, year 687 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 67 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placeRoman RepublicConsuls: Manius Acilius Glabrio and Gaius Calpurnius Piso. During Pompey's war against the pirates, he raises a fleet of 500 warships and fights with great success. 

Kerckhoffs's principle<====>53064<====>Kerckhoffs's principle In cryptography, Kerckhoffs's principle (also called Kerckhoffs's desideratum, assumption, axiom, doctrine or law) was stated by Dutch cryptographer Auguste Kerckhoffs in the 19th century:  A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge. Kerckhoffs's principle was reformulated (or perhaps independently formulated) by American mathematician Claude Shannon as "the enemy knows the system",    i. e. , "one ought to design systems under the assumption that the enemy will immediately gain full familiarity with them".   In that form, it is called Shannon's maxim.  In contrast to "security through obscurity", it is widely embraced by cryptographers. 

68 BC<====>53066<====>68 BC   Year 68 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Metellus/Vatia and Rex (or, less frequently, year 686 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 68 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placeRoman RepublicConsuls: Lucius Caecilius Metellus and Quintus Marcius Rex. October 6 – Lucius Lucullus defeats Tigranes II of Armenia in the Battle of Artaxata. Gaius Antonius Hybrida elected praetor.

At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Hortalus and Metellus (or, less frequently, year 685 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 69 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placeRoman RepublicOctober 6 – Roman Republic troops under Lucius Lucullus defeat the army of Tigranes II of Armenia in the Battle of Tigranocerta, and capture Tigranocerta, capital of Armenia. 

Stefan–Boltzmann constant<====>53068<====>Stefan–Boltzmann constant  The Stefan–Boltzmann constant (also Stefan's constant), a physical constant denoted by the Greek letter σ (sigma), is the constant of proportionality in the Stefan–Boltzmann law:  "the total intensity radiated over all wavelengths increases as the temperature increases", of a black body which is proportional to the fourth power of the thermodynamic temperature.The theory of thermal radiation lays down the theory of quantum mechanics, by using physics to relate to molecular, atomic and sub-atomic levels.  Slovenian physicist Josef Stefan formulated the constant in 1879, and it was later derived in 1884 by Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann. 

The Magician's Nephew<====>53071<====>The Magician's Nephew   The Magician's Nephew is a high fantasy novel for children by C.  S.  Lewis, published by Bodley Head in 1955.  It is the sixth published of seven novels in The Chronicles of Narnia (1950–1956); it is volume one of the series in recent editions, which sequence the books according to Narnia history.  Like the others, it was illustrated by Pauline Baynes whose work has been retained in many later editions.  The Bodley Head was a new publisher for The Chronicles, a change from Geoffrey Bles.   The Magician's Nephew is a prequel to the series. 

Jehuda Cresques<====>53075<====>Jehuda CresquesJehudà Cresques ( , 1360-1410), also known as Jafudà Cresques, Jaume Riba,  and Cresques lo Juheu ("Cresques the Jew"), "Cresques lo Juheu"  was a converso cartographer in the early 15th century. Son of Abraham Cresques, a famous Jewish cartographer, he was born in a Jewish family in Majorca, in the Majorcan-Catalan speaking part of Crown of Aragon, in present-day Spain.  Together he and his father were the probable authors of the famous Catalan Atlas of 1375. Cresques' work was highly sought after; in 1390 John I of Aragon paid 60 livres and 8 sous for one of his maps. 

Darwin (operating system)<====>53076<====>Darwin (operating system)  Darwin is an open-source Unix operating system released by Apple Inc.  in 2000.  It is composed of code developed by Apple, as well as code derived from NeXTSTEP, BSD, Mach, and other free software projects. Darwin forms the core set of components upon which macOS (previously OS X and Mac OS X), iOS, watchOS, and tvOS are based.  It is mostly POSIX-compatible, but has never, by itself, been certified as compatible with any version of POSIX.  Starting with Leopard, macOS has been certified as compatible with the Single UNIX Specification version 3 (SUSv3). 

Mission: Impossible<====>53078<====>Mission: Impossible   Mission: Impossible is an American  television series that was created and initially produced by Bruce Geller.  It chronicles the missions of a team of secret government agents known as the Impossible Missions Force (IMF).  In the first season, the team is led by Dan Briggs, played by Steven Hill; Jim Phelps, played by Peter Graves, takes charge for the remaining seasons.  A hallmark of the series shows Briggs or Phelps receiving his instructions on a recording that then self-destructs, followed by the theme music composed by Lalo Schifrin. The series was filmed and financed by Desilu Productions,  and aired on the CBS network from September 1966 to March 1973. 

History of El Salvador<====>53081<====>History of El Salvador The history of El Salvador begins with several Mesoamerican nations, especially the Cuzcatlecs, as well as the Lenca and Maya.  In the early 16th century, the Spanish Empire conquered the territory, incorporating it into the Viceroyalty of New Spain ruled from Mexico City.  In 1821, the country achieved independence from Spain as part of the First Mexican Empire, only to further secede as part of the Federal Republic of Central America in 1823.  Upon the republic's dissolution in 1841, El Salvador became sovereign until forming a short-lived union with Honduras and Nicaragua called the Greater Republic of Central America, which lasted from 1895 to 1898. 

Toy Story<====>53085<====>Toy Story    Toy Story is a 1995 American computer-animated buddy comedy adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures.  The directorial debut of John Lasseter, Toy Story was the first feature-length computer-animated film and the first feature film produced by Pixar.  Taking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys pretend to be lifeless whenever humans are present, the film's plot focuses on the relationship between Woody, an old-fashioned pullstring cowboy doll (voiced by Tom Hanks), and Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut action figure (voiced by Tim Allen), as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of Andy, their owner, to friends who work together to be reunited with Andy as his family prepares to move to a new home. 

Satanic Verses<====>53086<====>Satanic Verses  The Satanic Verses incident, known as qissat al-gharaniq (Story of the Cranes), is the name given to the occasion on which the Islamic Prophet Muhammad is said to have mistaken the words of "satanic suggestion" for divine revelation.    Narratives involving the alleged verses (or verse) can be read in, among other places, the biographies of Muhammad by al-Wāqidī, Ibn Sa'd (who was a scribe of Waqidi) and Ibn Ishaq (as reconstructed by Alfred Guillaume),    as well as the tafsir of al-Tabarī.  The majority of Muslim scholars have rejected the historicity of the incident on the basis of their weak isnads (chains of transmission) and the incompatibility of the incident with the theological doctrine of 'isma (Prophetic infallibility, divine protection of Muhammad from mistakes). 

Jean Lafitte<====>53087<====>Jean Lafitte   Jean Lafitte (  –  ) was a French pirate and privateer in the Gulf of Mexico in the early 19th century.   He and his elder brother, Pierre, spelled their last name Laffite, but English-language documents of the time used "Lafitte".  The latter has become the common spelling in the United States, including for places named after him.  Lafitte is believed to have been born either in Basque-France or the French colony of Saint-Domingue.  By 1805, he operated a warehouse in New Orleans to help disperse the goods smuggled by his brother Pierre Lafitte. 

Puebloans<====>53090<====>Puebloans The Puebloans or Pueblo peoples are Native Americans in the Southwestern United States who have lived in the time period of 100AD to present day.  Their style of living consisted of living in towns constructed of adobe, stone and other local materials.  Their buildings are constructed as complex apartments with numerous rooms, often built in strategic defensive positions.  Pueblo peoples speak languages from several different groups and are also divided culturally by their kinship systems and agricultural practices, although all cultivate varieties of maize. In addition to differing kinship systems, the Pueblo peoples have differing marriage practices: exogamous (or outside connections) or endogamous (within the clan or band). 

Spanish colonization of the Americas<====>53091<====>Spanish colonization of the Americas  The overseas expansion under the crown of Castile was initiated under royal authority and first accomplished by the Spanish conquistadores.   The Americas was incorporated into the Spanish Empire, with the exception of Brazil, and the crown created civil and religious structures to administer the region.  The motivations for colonial expansion were trade and the spread of the Catholic faith through indigenous conversions. Beginning with the 1492 arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Caribbean and continuing control of vast territory for over three centuries, the Spanish Empire would expand across the Caribbean Islands, half of South America, most of Central America and much of North America (including present day Mexico, Florida and the Southwestern and Pacific Coastal regions of the United States). 

Stan Rice<====>53092<====>Stan Rice   Stan Rice (November 7, 1942 – December 9, 2002) was an American poet and artist.  He was the husband of author Anne Rice. BiographyRice was born in Dallas, Texas in 1942.  He met his future wife in a high school journalism class in Richardson, Texas, and they married in Denton, Texas on October 14, 1961.  They briefly attended together North Texas State University in Denton, before moving to San Francisco in 1962, to enroll at San Francisco State University, where they both earned their MA. Rice was a professor of English and Creative Writing at San Francisco State University. 

Elric of Melniboné<====>53096<====>Elric of MelnibonéElric of Melniboné  is a fictional character created by Michael Moorcock and the protagonist of a series of sword and sorcery stories taking place on an alternate Earth.   The proper name and title of the character is Elric VIII, 428th Emperor of Melniboné.   Later stories by Moorcock marked Elric as a facet of the Eternal Champion. Elric first appeared in print in Moorcock's novella "The Dreaming City" (Science Fantasy No.  47, June 1961).   Moorcock's doomed albino antihero is one of the better known in fantasy literature, having crossed over into a wide variety of media, such as role-playing games, comics, music, and film. 

Sangre de Cristo Range<====>53097<====>Sangre de Cristo Range {{Infobox mountain range }}The Sangre de Cristo Range, called the East Range locally in the San Luis Valley, is a high, rugged and narrow mountain range of the Rocky Mountains in southern Colorado in the United States, running north and south along the east side of the Rio Grande Rift.  The mountains extend southeast from Poncha Pass for about 75 miles (120 km) through south-central Colorado to La Veta Pass, approximately 20 miles (32 km) west of Walsenburg, and form a high ridge separating the San Luis Valley on the west from the watershed of the Arkansas River on the east. 

Rio Grande rift<====>53098<====>Rio Grande riftThe Rio Grande Rift is a north-trending continental rift zone.  It separates the Colorado Plateau in the west from the interior of the North American craton on the east.The rift extends from central Colorado in the north to the state of Chihuahua, Mexico in the south.The rift zone consists of four basins that have an average width of 50 kilometers.   The rift can be observed on location at Rio Grande National Forest, White Sands National Monument, Santa Fe National Forest, and Cibola National Forest, among other locations. 

Vancouver Island<====>53099<====>Vancouver Island   Vancouver Island is in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, just off the coast of Canada.  It is part of the Canadian province of British Columbia.  The island is   in length,   in width at its widest point,  and   in area.  It is the largest island on the West Coast of North America. The southern part of Vancouver Island is the only part of British Columbia or Western Canada to lie south of the 49th Parallel, along with most of the southern Gulf Islands and minor offshore islands.  This area has one of the warmest climates in Canada, and since the mid-1990s has been mild enough in a few areas to grow subtropical Mediterranean crops such as olives and lemons. 

Natal Province<====>53101<====>Natal Province The Province of Natal ( ), commonly called the Natal Province, was a province of South Africa from 1910 until 1994.  Its capital was Pietermaritzburg.  During this period the areas inhabited by the black African population of Natal were organized into the bantustan of KwaZulu, which was progressively separated from the province, becoming partially autonomous in 1981.  Of the white population, the majority were English-speaking, causing Natal to become the only province to vote "no" to the creation of a republic in the referendum of 1960.   In the latter part of the 1980s, Natal was in a state of violence that only ended with the first multiracial election in 1994.

West Midlands (county)<====>53112<====>West Midlands (county)    The West Midlands is a metropolitan county and city region in western central England with a 2014 estimated population of 2,808,356,  making it the second most populous county in England.  It came into existence as a metropolitan county in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972, formed from parts of Staffordshire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire.  The county itself is a NUTS 2 region within the wider NUTS 1 region of the same name.  The county consists of seven metropolitan boroughs: the City of Birmingham, the City of Coventry, and the City of Wolverhampton, as well as the boroughs of Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, and Walsall. 

Charing Cross<====>53113<====>Charing Cross    Charing Cross ( )  denotes the junction of Strand, Whitehall and Cockspur Street, just south of Trafalgar Square in central London.  It gives its name to several landmarks, including Charing Cross railway station, one of the main London rail terminals. Charing Cross is named after the Eleanor cross that stood on the site, in what was once the hamlet of Charing.  The site of the cross has been occupied since 1675 by an equestrian statue of King Charles I.  A loose Victorian replica of the medieval cross, the Queen Eleanor Memorial Cross, was erected a short distance to the east outside the railway station. 

OpenStep<====>53114<====>OpenStep OpenStep is an object-oriented application programming interface (API) specification for a legacy object-oriented operating system, with the basic goal of offering a NeXTSTEP-like environment on a non-NeXTSTEP operating system.  OpenStep was principally developed by NeXT with Sun Microsystems, to allow NeXTSTEP (like) development on Sun's operating systems, specifically Solaris.  NeXT produced a version of OpenStep for their own Mach-based Unix, known as OPENSTEP (all capitalized),   as well as a version that ran on Windows NT.  The software libraries that shipped with OPENSTEP are a superset of the original OpenStep specification, including many features from the original NeXTSTEP. 

Milwaukee<====>53117<====>Milwaukee   Milwaukee ( ,  )  is the largest city in the state of Wisconsin and the fifth-largest city in the Midwestern United States.  The county seat of Milwaukee County, it is on Lake Michigan's western shore.  Ranked by estimated 2014 population, Milwaukee was the 31st largest city in the United States.   The city's estimated population in 2015 was 600,155.   Milwaukee is the main cultural and economic center of the Milwaukee metropolitan area.  It is also part of the larger Milwaukee-Racine-Waukesha combined statistical area, which had an estimated population of 2,026,243 in the 2010 census. 

438<====>53121<====>438Year 438 (CDXXXVIII) was a common year starting on Saturday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar.  At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Theodosius and Glabrio (or, less frequently, year 1191 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 438 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placeRoman EmpireEmperor Theodosius II forbids the divulging of secrets of naval carpentry, probably to avoid its spread to the rising Vandal power in North Africa. 

Unitary authority<====>53123<====>Unitary authority A unitary authority is a type of local authority that has a single tier and is responsible for all local government functions within its area or performs additional functions which elsewhere in the relevant country are usually performed by national government or a higher level of sub-national government. Typically unitary authorities cover towns or cities which are large enough to function independently of county or other regional administration.  Sometimes they consist of national sub-divisions which are distinguished from others in the same country by having no lower level of administration. CanadaIn Canada, each province creates its own system of local government, so terminology varies substantially. 

Yorkshire and the Humber<====>53129<====>Yorkshire and the Humber    Yorkshire and the Humber is one of nine official regions of England at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes.  It comprises most of Yorkshire (South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire including Hull, the shire county of North Yorkshire and the City of York), North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire.  It does not include Middlesbrough or Redcar and Cleveland.  The population in 2011 was 5,284,000.    The committees for the regions, including the one for Yorkshire and the Humber, ceased to exist upon the dissolution of Parliament on 12 April 2010; they were not re-established by the newly elected House. 

North East England<====>53130<====>North East EnglandNorth East England is one of nine official regions of England at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes.  It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the area of the former county of Cleveland in North Yorkshire.  The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom.   There are only three cities in the region; with Newcastle upon Tyne being the largest  with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. 

David Blaine<====>53131<====>David Blaine    David Blaine (born David Blaine White; April 4, 1973) is an American magician, illusionist and endurance artist.  He is best known for his high-profile feats of endurance, and has set and broken several world records. Blaine revolutionized the way magic is shown on television by focusing on spectator reactions.  His idea was to turn the camera around on the people watching instead of the performer, to make the audience watch the audience.  The New York Times noted that "he's taken a craft that's been around for hundreds of years and done something unique and fresh with it. 

Humanities<====>53132<====>Humanities Humanities are academic disciplines that study aspects of human society and culture.  In the renaissance, the term contrasted with divinity and referred to what is now called classics, the main area of secular study in universities at the time.  Today, the humanities are more frequently contrasted with natural, and sometimes social, sciences as well as professional training.  The humanities use methods that are primarily critical, or speculative, and have a significant historical element —as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences, "Humanity" 2. b, Oxford English Dictionary 3rd Ed.  (2003)  yet, unlike the sciences, it has no central discipline. 

Children's Online Privacy Protection Act<====>53133<====>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act    The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) is a United States federal law, located at   ( ) The act, effective April 21, 2000, applies to the online collection of personal information by persons or entities under U. S.  jurisdiction about children under 13 years of age.  It details what a website operator must include in a privacy policy, when and how to seek verifiable consent from a parent or guardian, and what responsibilities an operator has to protect children's privacy and safety online including restrictions on the marketing of those under 13. 

Magnetic anomaly detector<====>53135<====>Magnetic anomaly detector A magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) is an instrument used to detect minute variations in the Earth's magnetic field.  The term refers specifically to magnetometers used by military forces to detect submarines (a mass of ferromagnetic material creates a detectable disturbance in the magnetic field); military MAD equipment is a descendent of geomagnetic survey or aeromagnetic survey instruments used to search for minerals by detecting their disturbance of the normal earth-field. HistoryGeoexploration by measuring and studying variations in the Earth's magnetic field has been conducted by scientists since 1843.   The first uses of magnetometers were for the location of ore deposits. 

Weapon of mass destruction<====>53136<====>Weapon of mass destruction    A weapon of mass destruction  is a nuclear, radiological, chemical, biological or other weapon that can kill and bring significant harm to a large number of humans or cause great damage to human-made structures (e. g. , buildings), natural structures (e. g. , mountains), or the biosphere.  The scope and usage of the term has evolved and been disputed, often signifying more politically than technically.  Originally coined in reference to aerial bombing with chemical explosives, since World War II, it has come to refer to large-scale weaponry of other technologies, such as chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear. 

Nuclear utilization target selection<====>53140<====>Nuclear utilization target selection Nuclear utilization target selection (NUTS) is a hypothesis regarding the use of nuclear weapons often contrasted with mutually assured destruction (MAD).    NUTS theory at its most basic level asserts that it is possible for a limited nuclear exchange to occur and that nuclear weapons are simply one more rung on the ladder of escalation pioneered by Herman Kahn.    This leads to a number of other conclusions regarding the potential uses of and responses to nuclear weapons. Counterforce strikesA counterforce strike consists of an attack on enemy nuclear weapons meant to destroy them before they can be used. 

Metempsychosis<====>53141<====>Metempsychosis Metempsychosis ( ) is a philosophical term in the Greek language referring to transmigration of the soul, especially its reincarnation after death.  Generally, the term is derived from the context of ancient Greek philosophy, and has been recontextualised by modern philosophers such as Arthur Schopenhauer  and Kurt Gödel;  otherwise, the term "transmigration" is more appropriate.   The word plays a prominent role in James Joyce's Ulysses and is also associated with Nietzsche.   Another term sometimes used synonymously is palingenesis. Europe before the pre-Socratic philosophersIt is unclear how the doctrine of metempsychosis arose in Greece. 

Fragile X syndrome<====>53142<====>Fragile X syndrome  Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disorder.   Symptoms often include mild to moderate intellectual disability.   Physical features may include a long and narrow face, large ears, flexible fingers, and large testicles.   About a third of people have features of autism such as problems with social interactions and delayed speech.   Hyperactivity is common and seizures occur in about 10%.   Males are usually more affected than females.   Fragile X syndrome is typically due to an expansion of the CGG triplet repeat within the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene on the X chromosome. 

Nuclear explosive<====>53144<====>Nuclear explosive A nuclear explosive is an explosive device that derives its energy from nuclear reactions.  Almost all nuclear explosive devices that have been designed and produced are nuclear weapons intended for warfare. Other, non-warfare, applications for nuclear explosives have occasionally been proposed.  For example, nuclear pulse propulsion is a form of spacecraft propulsion that would use nuclear explosives to provide impulse to a spacecraft.  A similar application is the proposal to use nuclear explosives for asteroid deflection.  From 1958 to 1965 the United States government ran a project to design a nuclear explosive powered nuclear pulse rocket called Project Orion. 

Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle<====>53145<====>Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle  A multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) is a ballistic missile payload containing several thermonuclear warheads, each capable of being aimed to hit a different target.  By contrast, a unitary warhead is a single warhead on a single missile.  An intermediate case is the multiple reentry vehicle (MRV) missile which carries several warheads which are dispersed but not individually aimed.   Only the United States, United Kingdom, Russian Federation, France, Israel, and China are known to currently possess MIRV missiles. The first true MIRV design was the Minuteman III, introduced in 1970,  which held three smaller W62 warheads of about 170 kilotons in place of the single 1. 

Naval ship<====>53159<====>Naval ship A naval ship is a military ship (or sometimes boat, depending on classification) used by a navy.  Naval ships are differentiated from civilian ships by construction and purpose.  Generally, naval ships are damage resilient and armed with weapon systems, though armament on troop transports is light or non-existent. Naval ships designed primarily for naval warfare are termed warships, as opposed to support (auxiliary ships) or shipyard operations. Naval ship classification Naval ship classification is a field that has changed over time, and is not an area of wide international agreement, so this article currently uses the system as currently used by the United States Navy. 

Q-ship<====>53160<====>Q-ship Q-ships, also known as Q-boats, decoy vessels, special service ships, or mystery ships, were heavily armed merchant ships with concealed weaponry, designed to lure submarines into making surface attacks.  This gave Q-ships the chance to open fire and sink them. They were used by the British Royal Navy (RN) and the German Kaiserliche Marine during the First World War and by the RN, the Kriegsmarine and the United States Navy during the Second World War (1939–45). Early usesIn the 1670s, HMS Kingfisher (1675) was specially designed to counter the attacks of Algerian corsairs or pirates in the Mediterranean by masquerading as a merchantman, hiding her armament behind false bulkheads. 

PT boat<====>53165<====>PT boat  A PT boat (short for Patrol Torpedo boat) was a torpedo-armed fast attack craft used by the United States Navy in World War II.   It was small, fast, and inexpensive to build, valued for its maneuverability and speed but hampered at the beginning of the war by ineffective torpedoes, limited armament, and comparatively fragile construction that limited some of the variants to coastal waters. The PT boat was very different from the first generation of torpedo boat, which had been developed at the end of the 19th century and featured a displacement hull form.   These first generation torpedo boats rode low in the water, displaced up to 300 tons, and had a top speed of  . 

Submarine-launched ballistic missile<====>53170<====>Submarine-launched ballistic missile A submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) is a ballistic missile capable of being launched from submarines.  Modern variants usually deliver multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) each of which carries a nuclear warhead and allows a single launched missile to strike several targets.  Submarine-launched ballistic missiles operate in a different way from submarine-launched cruise missiles. Modern submarine-launched ballistic missiles are closely related to intercontinental ballistic missiles (range of over  ), and in many cases SLBMs and ICBMs may be part of the same family of weapons. HistoryOriginsThe first practical design of a submarine-based launch platform was developed by the Germans near the end of World War II involving a launch tube which contained a V-2 ballistic missile variant and was towed behind a submarine, known by the code-name Prüfstand XII. 

Boeing B-29 Superfortress<====>53179<====>Boeing B-29 Superfortress   The Boeing B-29 Superfortress is   a four-engine propeller-driven heavy bomber designed by Boeing, which was flown primarily by the United States during  World War II and the Korean War.  It was one of the largest aircraft operational during World War II and featured state-of-the-art technology.  Including design and production, it was the single most expensive weapons project undertaken by the United States in World War II, exceeding the cost of the Manhattan Project by between $1 and 1. 7 billion.   Innovations introduced included a pressurized cabin, dual-wheeled, tricycle landing gear, and an analog computer-controlled fire-control system that directed four remote machine gun turrets that could be operated by a single gunner and a fire-control officer. 

Old-school hip hop<====>53182<====>Old-school hip hopOld-school hip hop (also spelled old skool) describes the earliest commercially recorded hip hop music (approximately 1979–1983),  and the music in the preceding period from which it was directly descended (see Roots of hip hop).  Old school hip hop is said to have ended around 1984 due to changes in both rapping technique and the accompanying music and rhythms.  The image, styles and sounds of the old school were exemplified by figures like Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Kool Herc, Treacherous Three, Funky Four Plus One, Kurtis Blow, The Sugarhill Gang, Melle Mel, Super-Wolf , West Street Mob , Spoonie Gee, Kool Moe Dee, Busy Bee Starski, Lovebug Starski, The Cold Crush Brothers, Warp 9, T-Ski Valley, Grandmaster Caz, Doug E. 

New school hip hop<====>53183<====>New school hip hopThe new school of hip hop was a movement in hip hop music starting 1983–84 with the early records of Run–D. M. C.  and LL Cool J.  Like the hip hop preceding it, it came predominantly from New York City.  The new school was initially characterized in form by drum machine led minimalism, often tinged with elements of rock.  It was notable for taunts and boasts about rapping, and socio-political commentary, both delivered in an aggressive, self-assertive style.  In image as in song its artists projected a tough, cool, street b-boy attitude. 

French hip hop<====>53185<====>French hip hop  French hip hop is the hip hop music style which was developed in French-speaking countries. HistoryBeginning of French hip hop: the 70s and 80sBy 1982 and 1983, a number of hip hop radio shows had appeared on Paris radio, including "Rapper Dapper Snapper" (hosted by Sidney Duteil) and "Funk à Billy" (hosted by DJ Dee Nasty).  And, in November 1982, the first major international hip hop concert tour, the New York City Rap Tour, traveled around France and to London, England featuring Afrika Bambaataa, Grandmixer DST, Fab 5 Freddy, Mr Freeze and the Rock Steady Crew.

Italian hip hop<====>53187<====>Italian hip hop Italian hip hop started in the 1980s.   One of the first hip hop crews to catch the attention of the Italian mainstream was Milan's Articolo 31, then and still today produced by Franco Godi, who had written the soundtrack to the animated TV series Signor Rossi in the 1970s.   The European Music Office's report on Music in Europe claimed that, in general, hip hop from the south of Italy tends to be harder than that from the north.  HistoryIn the early 1980s, hip hop spread to Italy through Posse cuts, which were popular in centri sociali, alternative centers where several left-wing young people regularly met, and where the extremely influential Italian hardcore punk scene was flourishing, from which the Italian Posse Cut movement inherited its social conscious. 

Spanish hip hop<====>53188<====>Spanish hip hop Spanish hip hop is hip hop music produced in Spain. Spanish hip hop is directly influenced by United States' hip hop, and the hip hop produced in Latin America, and, to a lesser extent, by other European countries, such as France and the United Kingdom. At the same time, Spanish hip hop has an international audience (including tours, collaborations and mixtape exchanges), in Latin America, the United States and Europe. Latin American migration to Spain has also influenced the hip hop produced in the country, spreading certain sounds, like reggaeton. The hip hop culture in Spain is often socially conscious, and has a strong presence on working-class barrios (neighbourhoods), but it is not limited to these. 

GNU bison<====>53189<====>GNU bison GNU bison, commonly known as Bison, is a parser generator that is part of the GNU Project.  Bison reads a specification of a context-free language, warns about any parsing ambiguities, and generates a parser (either in C, C++, or Java) which reads sequences of tokens and decides whether the sequence conforms to the syntax specified by the grammar.  Bison by default generates LALR parsers but can also create GLR parsers.  In POSIX mode, Bison is compatible with Yacc, but also has several extensions over this earlier program.  Flex, an automatic lexical analyser, is often used with Bison, to tokenise input data and provide Bison with tokens.

Aztec mythology<====>53197<====>Aztec mythologyAztec mythology is the body or collection of myths of Aztec civilization of Central Mexico.   The Aztecs were Nahuatl-speaking groups living in central Mexico and much of their mythology is similar to that of other Mesoamerican cultures.   According to legend, the various groups who were to become the Aztecs arrived from the north into the Anahuac valley around Lake Texcoco.  The location of this valley and lake of destination is clear – it is the heart of modern Mexico City –  but little can be known with certainty about the origin of the Aztec. 

Aztec<====>53198<====>AztecAztec culture (  ), also known as Mexica culture, was a Mesoamerican culture that flourished in central Mexico in the post-classic period from 1300 to 1521, during the time in which a triple alliance of the Mexica, Texcoca and Tepaneca tribes established the Aztec empire.  The Aztec people were certain ethnic groups of central Mexico, particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language and who dominated large parts of Mesoamerica from the 14th to the 16th centuries.  The Aztec have also referred to themselves as the Meshika or Mehika.  Aztec culture is the culture of the people referred to as Aztecs, but since most ethnic groups of central Mexico in the postclassic period shared basic cultural traits, many of the traits that characterize Aztec culture cannot be said to be exclusive to the Aztecs.

Bering Strait<====>53212<====>Bering Strait  The Bering Strait ( ,  Beringov proliv, Yupik: Imakpik  ) is a strait of the Pacific, which borders with the Arctic to north.  It is located between Russia and the United States.  Named after Vitus Bering, a Danish explorer in the service of the Russian Empire, it lies slightly south of the Arctic Circle being at about 65° 40' N latitude.  The present Russia-US east-west boundary is at 168° 58' 37" W. The Strait has been the subject of the scientific hypothesis that humans migrated from Asia to North America across a land bridge known as Beringia when lower ocean levels – perhaps a result of glaciers locking up vast amounts of water – exposed a wide stretch of the sea floor,  both at the present strait and in the shallow sea north and south of it.

Exotic atom<====>53217<====>Exotic atomAn exotic atom is an otherwise normal atom in which one or more sub-atomic particles have been replaced by other particles of the same charge.  For example, electrons may be replaced by other negatively charged particles such as muons (muonic atoms) or pions (pionic atoms).   Exotic atoms  , AccessScience, McGraw-Hill.   Accessed on line September 26, 2007.    Because these substitute particles are usually unstable, exotic atoms typically have very short lifetimes. Muonic atomsIn a muonic atom (previously called a mu-mesic atom, now known to be a misnomer as muons are not mesons),  an electron is replaced by a muon, which, like the electron, is a lepton. 

Pionium<====>53218<====>PioniumPionium is an exotic atom consisting of one   and one   meson.  It can be created, for instance, by interaction of a proton beam accelerated by a particle accelerator and a target nucleus.  Pionium has a short lifetime, predicted by chiral perturbation theory to be  .  It decays mainly into two   mesons, and to a smaller extent into two photons. Pionium is currently under investigation at CERN to measure its lifetime.  The DIRAC collaboration was able to detect 21227 atomic pairs from a total of   events, which allows the pionium lifetime to be determined to within statistical errors of 9%. 

Sword and sorcery<====>53219<====>Sword and sorcery    Sword and sorcery (S&S) is a subgenre of fantasy characterized by sword-wielding heroes engaged in exciting and violent adventures.

Vein<====>53227<====>Vein Veins are blood vessels that carry blood toward the heart.  Most veins carry deoxygenated blood from the tissues back to the heart; exceptions are the pulmonary and umbilical veins, both of which carry oxygenated blood to the heart.  In contrast to veins, arteries carry blood away from the heart. Veins are less muscular than arteries and are often closer to the skin.  There are valves in most veins to prevent backflow. StructureVeins are present throughout the body as tubes that carry blood back to the heart.  Veins are classified in a number of ways, including superficial vs.

Balducci levitation<====>53253<====>Balducci levitation  The Balducci levitation is a levitation illusion first described by Ed Balducci.  Its inventor is unknown.  It is an impromptu magic trick, which has been popularized by many magicians, such as David Roth, Paul Harris, and David Blaine. EffectThe performer stands at an angle facing away from the spectators.  The performer appears to levitate a few inches above the ground.  The effect generally does not last for more than five seconds.  The performer's feet return to the ground, and the effect is complete. Advantages and disadvantagesOther methods of levitation allow for greater heights, longer durations, and better viewing angles (see definition of angles from List of conjuring terms) for performance; however, most of these methods can only be performed on a stage because they require special equipment or setups (such as wires). 

History of Sardinia<====>53254<====>History of Sardinia  Archaeological evidence of prehistoric human settlement on the island of Sardinia is present in the form of nuraghes and others prehistoric monuments, which dot the land.  The recorded history of Sardinia begins with its contacts with the various people who sought to dominate western Mediterranean trade in Classical Antiquity:  Phoenicians, Punics and Romans.  Initially under the political and economic alliance with the Phoenician cities, it was partly conquered by Carthage in the late 6th century BC and then entirely by Rome after the First Punic War (238 BC).  The island was included for centuries in the Roman province of Corsica et Sardinia, included in 3rd and 4th centuries in the Italia suburbicaria diocese.

Convolution theorem<====>53268<====>Convolution theorem In mathematics, the convolution theorem states that under suitableconditions the Fourier transform of a convolution is the pointwise product of Fourier transforms.  In other words, convolution in one domain (e. g. , time domain) equals point-wise multiplication in the other domain (e. g. , frequency domain).  Versions of the convolution theorem are true for various Fourier-related transforms. Let  \ f  and  \ g  be two functions with convolution  \ f*g  .  (Note that the asterisk denotes convolution in this context, and not multiplication.  The tensor product symbol  \otimes  is sometimes used instead.

Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban<====>53285<====>Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban  Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban, Seigneur de Vauban and later Marquis de Vauban (1 or 4 May 1633 – 30 March 1707),  commonly referred to as Vauban ( ), was a French military engineer who rose in the service to the king and was commissioned as a Marshal of France.  Considered the foremost engineer of his time, Vauban is known for his skills both in designing fortifications and breaking through them; his concepts, inspired by Pagan's "Les Fortifications", were the dominant model of fortification and siegecraft for nearly 100 years.  He also advised Louis XIV on how to consolidate France's borders in order to make them more defensible. 

Santalales<====>53286<====>Santalales The Santalales are an order of flowering plants with a cosmopolitan distribution, but heavily concentrated in tropical and subtropical regions.  It derives its name from its type genus Santalum (sandalwood).  Mistletoe is the common name for a number of parasitic plants within the order. OverviewMany of the members of the order are parasitic plants, mostly hemiparasites, able to produce sugars through photosynthesis, but tapping the stems or roots of other plants to obtain water and minerals; some (e. g.  Arceuthobium) are obligate parasites, have low concentrations of chlorophyll within their shoots (1/5 to 1/10 of that found in their host’s foliage), and derive the majority of their sustenance from their hosts' vascular tissues (water, micro- and macronutrients, and sucrose). 

Arales<====>53287<====>Arales Arales is a botanical name for an order of flowering plants.  The name was used in the Cronquist system for an order placed in subclass Arecidae, circumscribed as (1981):order Aralesfamily Acoraceaefamily Araceaefamily LemnaceaeIn the classification system of Dahlgren the Arales were in the superorder Ariflorae (also called Aranae), but did not include Acoraceae as a separate family.  Instead, Acorus, its only genus, was included in the Araceae.  Arales was the only order included in the Ariflorae. The APG II system elevates the first of these three families to become an order Acorales of its own (consisting of the single genus, Acorus) and unites the last two of these families into the one family Araceae assigning this to the order Alismatales. 

Araceae<====>53288<====>Araceae  The Araceae are a family of monocotyledonous flowering plants in which flowers are borne on a type of inflorescence called a spadix.  The spadix is usually accompanied by, and sometimes partially enclosed in, a spathe or leaf-like bract.  Also known as the arum family,  members are often colloquially known as aroids.  This family of 114 genera and about 3750 known species    is most diverse in the New World tropics, although also distributed in the Old World tropics and northern temperate regions. The largest collection of living Araceae is maintained at the Missouri Botanical Gardens. 

File Transfer Protocol<====>53289<====>File Transfer Protocol   The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network.  FTP is built on a client-server model architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client and the server.FTP users may authenticate themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it.  For secure transmission that protects the username and password, and encrypts the content, FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS). 

Coca<====>53292<====>Coca   Coca is any of the four cultivated plants in the family Erythroxylaceae, native to western South America. The plant is grown as a cash crop in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, even in areas where its cultivation is unlawful.    There are some reports that the plant is being cultivated in the south of Mexico as a cash crop and an alternative to smuggling its recreational product cocaine.  It also plays a role in many traditional Andean cultures as well as the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (see Traditional uses).  Coca is known throughout the world for its psychoactive alkaloid, cocaine. 

Tangloids<====>53293<====>TangloidsTangloids is a mathematical game for two players created by Piet Hein to model the calculus of spinors.

Two flat blocks of wood each pierced with three small holes are joined with three parallel strings.  Each player holds one of the blocks of wood.  The first player holds one block of wood still, while the other player rotates the other block of wood for two full revolutions. 

John of Gaunt<====>53294<====>John of Gaunt    John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster,  KG  (6 March 1340 – 3 February 1399) was an English nobleman and member of the House of Plantagenet, the third of five surviving sons of King Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault.  He was called "John of Gaunt" because he was born in Ghent, then rendered in English as Gaunt.  When he became unpopular later in life, scurrilous rumours and lampoons circulated that he was actually the son of a Ghent butcher, perhaps because Edward III was not present at the birth.

Natural satellite<====>53306<====>Natural satellite  A natural satellite or moon is, in the most common usage, an astronomical body that orbits a planet or minor planet (or sometimes another small Solar System body). In the Solar System there are six planetary satellite systems containing 175 known natural satellites.    Four IAU-listed dwarf planets are also known to have natural satellites: Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris.    , there are over 300 minor planets known to have moons.    The Earth–Moon system is unique in that the ratio of the mass of the Moon to the mass of Earth is much greater than that of any other natural-satellite–planet ratio in the Solar System (although there are minor-planet systems with even greater ratios, notably the Pluto–Charon system). 

Lepidoptera<====>53307<====>Lepidoptera  Lepidoptera (   ) is an order of insects that includes butterflies and moths (both are called lepidopterans).  About 180,000 species of the Lepidoptera are described, in 126 families    and 46 superfamilies,  10% of the total described species of living organisms.  It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world.The Lepidoptera show many variations of the basic body structure that have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution.  Recent estimates suggest the order may have more species than earlier thought,    and is among the four most   orders, along with the Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera. 

William Strunk Jr.<====>53308<====>William Strunk Jr. William Strunk Jr.  (July 1, 1869 – September 26, 1946) was an American professor of English at Cornell University and author of The Elements of Style (1918).

Life and careerStrunk was born and reared in Cincinnati, Ohio, the eldest of the four surviving children of William and Ella Garretson Strunk.   He earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Cincinnati in 1890 and a PhD at Cornell University in 1896. 

Psychedelic drug<====>53309<====>Psychedelic drug  Psychedelics are a class of hallucinogen, and are substances whose primary action is to alter cognition and perception, typically as serotonin receptor agonists,  causing thought and visual/auditory changes, and heightened state of consciousness.   Major psychedelic drugs include mescaline, LSD, psilocybin, and DMT.  Studies show that psychedelics are physiologically safe and do not lead to addiction.  In fact, two studies conducted using psilocybin in a psychotheraputic setting reveal that psychedelic drugs may assist with treating alcohol and nicotine addiction.  Differing with other psychoactive drugs, such as stimulants and opioids, psychedelics tend to qualitatively alter ordinary conscious experience. 

Vaccinium<====>53310<====>Vaccinium  Vaccinium    is a common and widespread genus of shrubs or dwarf shrubs in the heath family.  The fruits of many species are eaten by humans and some are of commercial importance, including the cranberry, blueberry, bilberry or whortleberry, lingonberry or cowberry, and huckleberry.  Like many other ericaceous plants, they are generally restricted to acidic soils. DescriptionThe plant structure varies between species: some trail along the ground, some are dwarf shrubs, and some are larger shrubs perhaps   tall.  The fruit develops from an inferior ovary, and is a berry; it is usually brightly coloured, often being red or bluish with purple juice. 

Hermann von Helmholtz<====>53311<====>Hermann von Helmholtz  Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz (August 31, 1821 – September 8, 1894) was a German physician and physicist who made significant contributions in several scientific fields.  The largest German association of research institutions, the Helmholtz Association, is named after him.In physiology and psychology, he is known for his mathematics of the eye, theories of vision, ideas on the visual perception of space, color vision research, and on the sensation of tone, perception of sound, and empiricism in the physiology of perception. In physics, he is known for his theories on the conservation of energy, work in electrodynamics, chemical thermodynamics, and on a mechanical foundation of thermodynamics. 

Vitaceae<====>53313<====>Vitaceae The Vitaceae are a family of dicotyledonous flowering plants, with 14 genera and ca 910 known species,    including the grapevine and Virginia creeper.  The family name is derived from the genus Vitis.   The name sometimes appears as Vitidaceae, but Vitaceae is a conserved name and therefore has priority over both Vitidaceae and another name sometimes found in the older literature, Ampelidaceae.  In the APG III system (2009) onwards, the family is placed in its own order, Vitales.  Molecular phylogenetic studies place the Vitales as the most basal clade in the rosids.

Acerola is native to South America, southern Mexico, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Brazil, and Central America, but is now also being grown as far north as Texas and in subtropical areas of Asia, such as India. It is known for being extremely rich in vitamin C,  almost as much as camu camu, although it also contains vitamins A, B 1 , B 2 , and B 3 , as well as carotenoids and bioflavonoids, which provide important nutritive value and have antioxidant uses. 

Sand Hill Road<====>53319<====>Sand Hill Road Sand Hill Road, often shortened to just "Sand Hill",    is an arterial road in Menlo Park, California, notable for its concentration of venture capital companies.   The road has become a metonym for that industry; nearly every top Silicon Valley company has been the beneficiary of early funding from firms on Sand Hill Road.    Its significance as a symbol of private equity in the United States is compared to that of Wall Street and the stock market,    and K Street in Washington, D. C.  and political lobbying. 

Frederick Law Olmsted<====>53321<====>Frederick Law Olmsted    Frederick Law Olmsted (April 26, 1822 – August 28, 1903) was an American landscape architect, journalist, social critic, and public administrator. He is popularly considered to be the father of American landscape architecture. Olmsted was famous for co-designing many well-known urban parks with his senior partner Calvert Vaux, including Central Park  in New York City, Golden Gate Park in San Francisco  and Elm Park in Worcester, Massachusetts, considered by many to be the first municipal park in America.Other projects that Olmsted was involved in include the country's first and oldest coordinated system of public parks and parkways in Buffalo, New York; the country's oldest state park, the Niagara Reservation in Niagara Falls, New York; one of the first planned communities in the United States, Riverside, Illinois; Mount Royal Park in Montreal, Quebec; the Emerald Necklace in Boston, Massachusetts; Highland Park in Rochester, New York; Belle Isle Park, in the Detroit River for Detroit, Michigan; the Grand Necklace of Parks in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Cherokee Park and entire parks and parkway system in Louisville, Kentucky; the   Forest Park in Springfield, Massachusetts, featuring America's first public "wading pool";  the George Washington Vanderbilt II Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina; the master plans for the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Maine, and Stanford University near Palo Alto, California, the lower campus of Colgate University,  as well as for The Lawrenceville School; and Montebello Park in St. Catharines, Ontario. In Chicago his projects include: Jackson Park; Washington Park; the Midway Plaisance for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition; the south portion of Chicago's "emerald necklace" boulevard ring; Anderson Park in Upper Montclair, New Jersey; Cadwalader Park in Trenton, New Jersey; and the University of Chicago campus. In Washington, D.C., he worked on the landscape surrounding the United States Capitol building.The quality of Olmsted's landscape architecture was recognized by his contemporaries, who showered him with prestigious commissions. His work, especially in Central Park in New York City, set a standard of excellence that continues to influence landscape architecture in the United States. He was an early and important activist in the conservation movement, including work at Niagara Falls; the Adirondack region of upstate New York; and the National Park system; and though little known, played a major role in organizing and providing medical services to the Union Army in the Civil War. BiographyEarly life and educationOlmsted was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on April 26, 1822. His father, John Olmsted, was a prosperous merchant who took a lively interest in nature, people, and places; Frederick Law and his younger brother, John Hull, also showed this interest. His mother, Charlotte Law (Hull) Olmsted, died before his fourth birthday.  His father remarried in 1827 to Mary Ann Bull, who shared her husband's strong love of nature and had perhaps a more cultivated taste.When the young Olmsted was almost ready to enter Yale College,  sumac poisoning weakened his eyes, so he gave up college plans. After working as an apprentice seaman, merchant, and journalist, Olmsted settled on a 125-acre farm in January 1848 on the south shore of Staten Island NY, a farm which his father helped him acquire. This farm, originally named the Akerly Homestead, was renamed Tosomock Farm by Olmsted. It was later renamed "The Woods of Arden" by owner Erastus Wiman. (The house in which Olmsted lived still stands at 4515 Hylan Boulevard, near Woods of Arden Road.)Marriage and familyOn June 13, 1859, Olmsted married Mary Cleveland (Perkins) Olmsted, the widow of his brother John (who had died in 1857). Daniel Fawcett Tiemann, the mayor of New York, officiated the wedding. He adopted her three children (his nephews and niece), John Charles Olmsted, Charlotte Olmsted (Bryant) and Owen Olmsted. Frederick and Mary had two children together who survived infancy: a daughter, Marion (born October 28, 1861), and a son Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.  Their first child, John Theodore Olmsted, was born on June 13, 1860, and died in infancy. CareerJournalismOlmsted had a significant career in journalism. In 1850 he traveled to England to visit public gardens, where he was greatly impressed by Joseph Paxton's Birkenhead Park. He subsequently wrote and published Walks and Talks of an American Farmer in England in 1852. This supported his getting additional work.Interested in the slave economy, he was commissioned by the New York Daily Times (now The New York Times) to embark on an extensive research journey through the American South and Texas from 1852 to 1857. His dispatches to the Times were collected into three volumes (A Journey in the Seaboard Slave States (1856), A Journey Through Texas (1857), A Journey in the Back Country in the Winter of 1853-4 (1860)) which remain vivid first-person social documents of the pre-war South. A one-volume abridgment, Journeys and Explorations in the Cotton Kingdom (1861), was published during the first six months of the American Civil War at the suggestion of Olmsted's English publisher.  To this he wrote a new introduction (on "The Present Crisis") in which he stated explicitly his views on the effect of slavery on the economy and social conditions of the southern states. My own observation of the real condition of the people of our Slave States, gave me ... an impression that the cotton monopoly in some way did them more harm than good; and although the written narration of what I saw was not intended to set this forth, upon reviewing it for the present publication, I find the impression has become a conviction. He argued that slavery had made the slave states inefficient (a set amount of work took 4 times as long in Virginia as in the North) and backward both economically and socially. The profits of slavery fell to no more than 8,000 owners of large plantations; a somewhat larger group had about the standard of living of a New York City policeman, but the proportion of the free white men who were as well-off as a Northern working man was small. Slavery meant that 'the proportion of men improving their condition was much less than in any Northern community; and that the natural resources of the land were strangely unused, or were used with poor economy.'Southern civilization was restricted to the wealthy plantation owners; the poverty of the rest of the Southern white population prevented the development of civil amenities taken for granted in the North, he said. The citizens of the cotton States, as a whole, are poor. They work little, and that little, badly; they earn little, they sell little; they buy little, and they have little – very little – of the common comforts and consolations of civilized life. Their destitution is not material only; it is intellectual and it is moral... They were neither generous nor hospitable and their talk was not that of evenly courageous men.  In between his travels in Europe and the South, Olmsted served as an editor for Putnam's Magazine for 2 years  and an agent with Dix, Edwards and Co., prior to the company's insolvency during the Panic of 1857. Olmsted provided financial support for, and occasionally wrote for, the magazine The Nation, which was founded in 1865.   New York City's Central ParkAndrew Jackson Downing, the charismatic landscape architect from Newburgh, New York, was one of the first who proposed the development of New York's Central Park in his role as publisher of The Horticulturist magazine. A friend and mentor to Olmsted, Downing introduced him to the English-born architect Calvert Vaux. Downing had brought Vaux from England as his architect collaborator. After Downing died in July 1852, in a widely publicized steamboat explosion on the Hudson River, Olmsted and Vaux entered the Central Park design competition together, against Egbert Ludovicus Viele among others. Vaux had invited the less experienced Olmsted to participate in the design competition with him, having been impressed with Olmsted's theories and political contacts. Prior to this, in contrast with the more experienced Vaux, Olmsted had never actually designed and executed a landscape design.They were announced as winners in 1858. On his return from the South, Olmsted began executing their plan almost immediately. Olmsted and Vaux continued their informal partnership to design Prospect Park in Brooklyn from 1865 to 1873.    That was followed by other projects. Vaux remained in the shadow of Olmsted's grand public personality and social connections.The design of Central Park embodies Olmsted's social consciousness and commitment to egalitarian ideals. Influenced by Downing and his own observations regarding social class in England, China, and the American South, Olmsted believed that the common green space must always be equally accessible to all citizens, and was to be defended against private encroachment. This principle is now fundamental to the idea of a "public park", but was not assumed as necessary then. Olmsted's tenure as park commissioner in New York was a long struggle to preserve that idea. Leader of Sanitary CommissionOlmsted took leave as director of Central Park to work as Executive Secretary of the U.S. Sanitary Commission, a precursor to the Red Cross in Washington, D.C. He tended to the wounded during the American Civil War. In 1862 during Union General George B. McClellan's Peninsula Campaign, Olmsted headed the medical effort for the sick and wounded at White House in New Kent County, where there was a ship landing on the Pamunkey River.On the home front, Olmsted was one of the six founding members of the Union League Club of New York.In addition to the above Olmsted helped to raise three colored (African American) regiments in New York City and organized a fair which raised one million dollars for the United States Sanitary Commission.In recognition of his services during the Civil War, Olmsted was elected a Third Class member of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) on May 2, 1888, and was assigned insignia number 6345. Olmsted's election to MOLLUS is significant in that he was one of the few civilians elected to membership in an organization composed almost exclusively of military officers and their descendants.  In 1891 he joined the Connecticut Society of the Sons of the American Revolution by right of his descent from his grandfather Benjamin Olmsted who served in the 4th Connecticut Regiment in 1775. U.S. park designerIn 1863 he went west to become the manager of the Rancho Las Mariposas-Mariposa mining estate in the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. In 1865 Vaux and Olmsted formed Olmsted, Vaux & Co. When Olmsted returned to New York, he and Vaux designed Prospect Park; suburban Chicago's Riverside parks; the park system for Buffalo, New York; Milwaukee, Wisconsin's grand necklace of parks; and the Niagara Reservation at Niagara Falls.Olmsted not only created numerous city parks around the country, he also conceived of entire systems of parks and interconnecting parkways to connect certain cities to green spaces. Some of the best examples of the scale on which Olmsted worked are the park system designed for Buffalo, New York, one of the largest projects; the system he designed for Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and the park system designed for Louisville, Kentucky, which was one of only four completed Olmsted-designed park systems in the world.   Olmsted was a frequent collaborator with architect Henry Hobson Richardson, for whom he devised the landscaping schemes for half a dozen projects, including Richardson's commission for the Buffalo State Asylum. In 1883 Olmsted established what is considered to be the first full-time landscape architecture firm in Brookline, Massachusetts. He called the home and office compound Fairsted. It is now the restored Frederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site. From there Olmsted designed Boston's Emerald Necklace, the campuses of Stanford University and the University of Chicago, as well as the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, among many other projects.ConservationistOlmsted was an important early leader of the conservation movement in the United States. An expert on California, he was likely one of the gentlemen "of fortune, of taste and of refinement" who proposed, through Senator John Conness, that Congress designate Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Big Tree Grove as public reserves.  This was the first land set aside by Congress for public use. Olmsted served a one-year appointment on the Board of Commissioner of the state reserve, and his 1865 report to Congress on the board's recommendations laid an ethical framework for the government to reserve public lands, to protect their "value to posterity". He described the "sublime" and "stately" landscape, emphasizing that the value of the landscape was not in any one individual waterfall, cliff, or tree, but in the "miles of scenery where cliffs of awful height and rocks of vast magnitude and of varied and exquisite coloring, are banked and fringed and draped and shadowed by the tender foliage of noble and lovely trees and bushes, reflected from the most placid pools, and associated with the most tranquil meadows, the most playful streams, and every variety of soft and peaceful pastoral beauty." In the 1880s he was active in efforts to conserve the natural wonders of Niagara Falls, threatened with industrialization by the building of electrical power plants. At the same time, he campaigned to preserve the Adirondack region in upstate New York. He was one of the founders of the American Society of Landscape Architects in 1898. Olmsted was also known to oppose park projects on conservationist grounds. In 1891, Olmsted refused to develop a plan for Presque Isle near Marquette, Michigan, saying that it "should not be marred by the intrusion of artificial objects." Death and legacyIn 1895, senility forced Olmsted to retire. By 1898 he moved to Belmont, Massachusetts, and took up residence as a patient at the McLean Hospital, for whose grounds he had submitted a design which was never executed. He remained there until his death in 1903. He was buried in the Old North Cemetery, in Hartford, Connecticut.After Olmsted's retirement and death, his sons John Charles Olmsted and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., continued the work of their firm, doing business as the Olmsted Brothers. The firm lasted until 1980. Many works by the Olmsted sons are mistakenly credited to Fredrick Law Olmsted today. For instance, the Olmsted Brothers firm did a park plan for Portland, Maine, in 1905, creating a series of connecting parkways between existing parks and suggesting improvements to those parks. The oldest of these parks, Deering Oaks, had been designed by City Engineer William Goodwin in 1879 but is today frequently described as a Frederick Law Olmsted designed park.A quotation from Olmsted's friend and colleague architect Daniel Burnham could serve as an epitaph. Referring to Olmsted in March 1893, Burnham said, "An artist, he paints with lakes and wooded slopes; with lawns and banks and forest covered hills; with mountain sides and ocean views." A residence hall at the University of Hartford was named in his honor. Olmsted Point, located in Yosemite National Park,  was named after Olmsted and his son Frederick. Olmsted's principles of design Drawing influences from English landscape and gardening,  Olmsted's principles of design, generally speaking, encourage the full utilization of the naturally occurring features of a given space,  its "genius"; the subordination of individual details to the whole so that decorative elements do not take precedence, but rather the whole space; concealment of design, design that does not call attention to itself; design which works on the unconscious to produce relaxation; and utility or purpose over ornamentation. A bridge, a pathway, a tree, a pasture: any and all elements are brought together to produce a particular effect.Olmsted designed primarily in the pastoral and picturesque styles, each to achieve a particular effect. The pastoral style featured vast expanses of green with small lakes, trees and groves and produced a soothing, restorative effect on the viewer. The picturesque style covered rocky, broken terrain with teeming shrubs and creepers and struck the viewer with a sense of nature's richness. The picturesque style played with light and shade to lend the landscape a sense of mystery.Scenery was designed to enhance the sense of space: indistinct boundaries using plants, brush and trees as opposed to sharp ones; interplay of light and shadow close up and blurred detail further away. A vast expanse of greenery at the end of which lies a grove of yellow poplar; a path that winds through a bit of landscape and intersects with others, dividing the terrain into triangular islands of successive new views.Subordination strives to use all objects and features in the service of the design and its intended effect. It can be seen in the subtle use of naturally occurring plants throughout the park. Non-native species planted for the sake of their own uniqueness defeat the purpose of design, as that very uniqueness draws attention to itself where the intention is to enable relaxation: utility above all else.Separation applies to areas designed in different styles and different uses enhancing safety and reducing distraction. A key feature of Central Park is the use of sunken roadways which traverse the park and are specifically dedicated to vehicles as opposed to winding paths designated specifically for pedestrians.A beautiful example of this mix of principles is seen in the Park's Mall in New York's Central Park, a large promenade leading to the Bethesda Terrace and the single formal feature in Olmsted and Vaux's original naturalistic design. The designers wrote that a "'grand promenade' was an 'essential feature of a metropolitan park'";  however, its formal symmetry, its style, though something of an aberration, was designed so as to be subordinate to the natural view surrounding it. Wealthy passengers were let from their carriages at its south end. The carriage would then drive around to the Terrace, which overlooked the Lake and Ramble to pick them up, saving them the trouble of needing to double back on foot. The Promenade was lined with slender elms and offered views of Sheep Meadow. Affluent New Yorkers, who rarely walked through the park, mixed with the less well-to-do, and all enjoyed an escape from the hustle and bustle of the surrounding city.Academic campuses designed by OlmstedOlmsted designed numerous school and college campuses between 1857 and 1895.From 1895 to 1950, the Olmsted Brothers (his successors) added to some of their father's initial projects, as well as designing new ones. (See their article for projects.) Together, these works totaled 355. Some of the most famous of Frederick Law Olmsted are listed here.

In the book, his personality and actions are given significant coverage. In addition, his importance in designing the fair is highlighted (e.g., his part in picking the geographic site and his bureaucratic involvement in planning the fair).In the book The Silent Girls  by Eric Rickstad, Olmsted had designed the farm/estate of the wealthy Pratt family.  "... the family had hired so-called geniuses to create carriage trails of crushed pink marble, doze earth to mold the rolling hills, and strategically plant thousands of red oaks to replicate some sort of Victorian pastoral aesthetic. These hills had been designed and sculpted by a supposedly famous landscape engineer named Frederick Law Olmsted Senior. The original land had been flat as a beaver tail, scraped smooth by glaciers. The hills and oaks had all been purchased, were a manufactured deception."See alsoFrederick Law Olmsted National Historic SiteCharles Loring BraceLandscape designerHistory of gardeningNotes References   Roper, Laura Wood.

Saffron<====>53332<====>Saffron   Saffron (pronounced   or  )  is a spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus, commonly known as the "saffron crocus".   The vivid crimson stigmas and styles, called threads, are collected and dried to be used mainly as a seasoning and colouring agent in food.  Saffron, long among the world's most costly spices by weight,    was probably first cultivated in or near Greece.   C.  sativus is probably a form of C.  cartwrightianus, that emerged by human cultivators selectively breeding plants for unusually long stigmas in late Bronze Age Crete. 

Endometriosis<====>53335<====>Endometriosis   Endometriosis is a condition in which the layer of tissue that normally covers the inside of the uterus grows outside of it.    Most often this is on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and tissue around the uterus and ovaries; however, in rare cases it may also occur in other parts of the body.   The main symptoms are pelvic pain and infertility.   Nearly half of those affected have chronic pelvic pain, while in 70% pain occurs during menstruation.   Pain during sex is also common.   Infertility occurs in up to half of women affected. 

Pope Cornelius<====>53336<====>Pope Cornelius  Pope Cornelius (died June 253) was the Bishop of Rome from 6 or 13 March 251 to his martyrdom in 253.  Chapman, John (1908).

Cervical cancer<====>53338<====>Cervical cancer  Cervical cancer is a cancer arising from the cervix.   It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body.Early on, typically no symptoms are seen.   Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pain during sexual intercourse.While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer.   Human papillomavirus infection (HPV) causes more than 90% of cases;  most people who have had HPV infections, however, do not develop cervical cancer.

Puck (mythology)<====>53344<====>Puck (mythology)In English folklore, Puck, sometimes known as Robin Goodfellow,  is a domestic and nature sprite, demon, or fairy. Origins and comparative folkloreEtymologyThe etymology of puck is uncertain.   The modern English word is attested already in Old English as puca (with a diminutive form pucel).  Similar words are attested later in Old Norse (púki, with related forms including Old Swedish puke, Icelandic púki, and Frisian puk) but also in the Celtic languages (Welsh pwca, Cornish bucca and Irish púca).  Most commentators think that the word was borrowed from one of these neighbouring north-west European languages into the others, but it is not certain in what direction the borrowing went, and all vectors have been proposed by scholars.

Hockey puck<====>53347<====>Hockey puck A hockey puck is a disk made of vulcanized rubber that serves the same functions in various games as a ball does in ball games.  The best-known use of pucks is in ice hockey, a major international sport. OriginsIce hockey and its various precursor games utilized balls until the late 19th century.  By the 1870s, 'flat' pucks were made of wood as well as rubber.  At first, pucks were square.  The first recorded organized game of ice hockey used a wooden puck to prevent it from leaving the rink of play.   The rubber pucks were first made by slicing a rubber ball, then trimming the disc square. 

Puck (moon)<====>53348<====>Puck (moon) Puck (   ) is an inner moon of Uranus.  It was discovered in December 1985 by the Voyager 2 spacecraft.   The name Puck follows the convention of naming Uranus's moons after characters from Shakespeare.  The orbit of Puck lies between the rings of Uranus and the first of Uranus's large moons, Miranda.  Puck is approximately spherical in shape and has diameter of about 162 km.   It has a dark, heavily cratered surface, which shows spectral signs of water ice.

Satellite constellation<====>53351<====>Satellite constellationA satellite constellation is a group of artificial satellites working in concert.   Such a constellation can be considered to be a number of satellites with coordinated ground  , operating together under shared control, synchronized so that they overlap well in coverage, the period in which a satellite or other spacecraft is visible above the local horizon. OverviewLow Earth orbiting satellites (LEOs) are often deployed in satellite constellations, because the coverage area provided by a single LEO satellite only covers a small area that moves as the satellite travels at the high angular velocity needed to maintain its orbit.

Reconnaissance satellite<====>53366<====>Reconnaissance satellite  A reconnaissance satellite (commonly, although unofficially, referred to as a spy satellite) is an Earth observation satellite or communications satellite deployed for military or intelligence applications. The first generation type (i. e. , Corona and Zenit) took photographs, then ejected canisters of photographic film which would descend to earth.  Corona capsules were retrieved in mid-air as they floated down on parachutes.  Later, spacecraft had digital imaging systems and downloaded the images via encrypted radio links. In the United States, most information available is on programs that existed up to 1972, as this information has been declassified due to its age.

Befunge<====>53391<====>Befunge  Befunge is a stack-based, reflective, esoteric programming language.  It differs from conventional languages in that programs are arranged on a two-dimensional grid.  "Arrow" instructions direct the control flow to the left, right, up or down, and loops are constructed by sending the control flow in a cycle.  It has been described as "a cross between Forth and Lemmings. "  HistoryThe language was originally created by Chris Pressey  in 1993 for the Amiga, as an attempt to devise a language which is as hard to compile as  possible.  Note that the  p  command allows for self-modifying code.

Stand-in<====>53396<====>Stand-in  A stand-in for film and television is a person who substitutes for the actor before filming, for technical purposes such as lighting and camera setup. Stand-ins are helpful in the initial processes of film and television production.  The underlying problem is that quick-and-dirty consumer shortcuts (autofocus, deep focus, and relying on as-is location lighting) are simply insufficient to create the professional look which audiences expect from modern cinematography.   Professional lighting and camera setup are always done manually and can be extremely time-consuming and tedious.   Actors strongly prefer to be elsewhere during that time. 

Esoteric programming language<====>53398<====>Esoteric programming language An esoteric programming language (sometimes shortened to esolang) is a programming language designed to test the boundaries of computer programming language design, as a proof of concept, as software art, as a hacking interface to another language (particularly functional programming or procedural programming languages), or as a joke.   The use of   distinguishes these languages from programming languages that working developers use to write software.  Usually, an esolang's creators do not intend the language to be used for mainstream programming, although some esoteric features, such as visuospatial syntax,   have inspired practical applications in the arts.

Frank Gehry<====>53404<====>Frank Gehry   Frank Owen Gehry,   ( ; born Frank Owen Goldberg;  ) Reinhart, Anthony (July 28, 2010) "Frank Gehry clears the air", Globe and Mail  is a Canadian-born American architect, residing in Los Angeles.A number of his buildings, including his private residence, have become world-renowned attractions. His works are cited as being among the most important works of contemporary architecture in the 2010 World Architecture Survey, which led Vanity Fair to label him as "the most important architect of our age".   Gehry's best-known works include the titanium-clad Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain; Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles; Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris, France; MIT Ray and Maria Stata Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts; The Vontz Center for Molecular Studies on the University of Cincinnati campus; Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle; New World Center in Miami Beach; Weisman Art Museum at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis; Dancing House in Prague; the Vitra Design Museum and the MARTa Herford museum in Germany; the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto; the Cinémathèque Française in Paris; and 8 Spruce Street in New York City.It was his private residence in Santa Monica, California, that jump-started his career. Gehry is also the designer of the future National Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial. Early lifeGehry was born Frank Owen Goldberg  on February 28, 1929, in Toronto, Ontario, to parents Sadie Thelma (née Kaplanski/Caplan) and Irving Goldberg.  His father was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Russian Jewish parents, and his mother was a Polish Jewish immigrant born in Łódź. Finding Your Roots, February 2, 2016, PBS    A creative child, he was encouraged by his grandmother, Leah Caplan,  with whom he would build little cities out of scraps of wood.    With these scraps from her husband's hardware store, she entertained him for hours, building imaginary houses and futuristic cities on the living room floor. His use of corrugated steel, chain link fencing, unpainted plywood and other utilitarian or "everyday" materials was partly inspired by spending Saturday mornings at his grandfather's hardware store. He would spend time drawing with his father, while his mother introduced him to the world of art. "So the creative genes were there", Gehry says. "But my father thought I was a dreamer, I wasn't gonna amount to anything. It was my mother who thought I was just reticent to do things. She would push me." He was given the Hebrew name "Ephraim" by his grandfather, but only used it at his bar mitzvah. EducationIn 1947, his family immigrated to the United States settling in California. Gehry got a job driving a delivery truck, and studied at Los Angeles City College, eventually to graduate from the University of Southern California's School of Architecture. During that time, he became a member of Alpha Epsilon Pi. According to Gehry, "I was a truck driver in L.A., going to City College, and I tried radio announcing, which I wasn't very good at. I tried chemical engineering, which I wasn't very good at and didn't like, and then I remembered. You know, somehow I just started wracking my brain about, 'What do I like?' Where was I? What made me excited? And I remembered art, that I loved going to museums and I loved looking at paintings, loved listening to music. Those things came from my mother, who took me to concerts and museums. I remembered Grandma and the blocks, and just on a hunch, I tried some architecture classes."    Gehry graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture degree from USC in 1954. After graduating from college, he spent time away from the field of architecture in numerous other jobs, including service in the United States Army.  In the fall of 1956, he moved his family to Cambridge, where he studied city planning at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. He left before completing the program, disheartened and underwhelmed.    Gehry's left-wing ideas about socially responsible architecture were under-realized,  and the final straw occurred when he sat in on a discussion of one professor's "secret project in progress"—a palace that he was designing for right-wing Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista (1901–1973).   CareerGehry returned to Los Angeles to work for Victor Gruen Associates, who he had apprenticed for while at USC School of Architecture. In 1957 he was given the chance to design and construct his first private residence at the age of 28, with friend and old classmate Greg Walsh. Built in Idyllwild, California for his wife Anita’s family neighbor Melvin David, "The David Cabin",  shows features that were to become synonymous with later work. The over   mountain retreat has unique design features with strong Asian influences, stemming from his earliest inspirations at the time like Shosoin Treasure House in Nara, Japan, among others. Beams protrude from the exterior sides, vertical grain douglas fir detail, and exposed, unfinished ceiling beams are prominent features.In 1961, he moved to Paris where he worked for architect Andre Remondet.  In 1962, Gehry established a practice in Los Angeles which became Frank Gehry and Associates in 1967  and then Gehry Partners in 2001.  Gehry's earliest commissions were all in Southern California, where he designed a number of innovative commercial structures such as Santa Monica Place (1980) and residential buildings such as the eccentric Norton House (1984) in Venice, California. Among these works, however, Gehry's most notable design may be the renovation of his own Santa Monica, California residence.  Originally built in 1920 and purchased by Gehry in 1977, the house features a metallic exterior wrapped around the original building that leaves many of the original details visible.  Gehry still resides there.Other completed buildings designed by Gehry during the 1980s include the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium (1981) in San Pedro and the California Aerospace Museum (1984) at the California Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles.In 1989, Gehry was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize. The jury cited Gehry as "Always open to experimentation, he has as well a sureness and maturity that resists, in the same way that Picasso did, being bound either by critical acceptance or his successes. His buildings are juxtaposed collages of spaces and materials that make users appreciative of both the theatre and the back-stage, simultaneously revealed." Though Gehry continued to design other notable buildings in California such as the Chiat/Day Building (1991) in Venice in collaboration with Claes Oldenburg, which is well known for its massive sculpture of binoculars, he also began to receive larger national and international commissions. These include Gehry's first European commission, the Vitra International Furniture Manufacturing Facility and Design Museum in Germany completed in 1989. This was soon followed by other major commissions including the Frederick Weisman Museum of Art  (1993) in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the Cinémathèque Française  (1994) in Paris, and the Dancing House  (1996) in Prague.In 1997, Gehry vaulted to a new level of international acclaim  when the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao opened in Bilbao, Spain. Hailed by The New Yorker as a "masterpiece of the twentieth century" and legendary architect Philip Johnson as "the greatest building of our time",  the museum became famous for its striking yet aesthetically pleasing design and the economic effect that it had on the city.Since then, Gehry has regularly won major commissions and has further established himself as one of the world's most notable architects. His best received works include several concert halls for classical music, such as the boisterous and curvaceous Walt Disney Concert Hall (2003) in Downtown Los Angeles, which has been the centerpiece of the neighborhood's revitalization and has been labeled by the Los Angeles Times as "the most effective answer to doubters, naysayers, and grumbling critics an American architect has ever produced",  the open-air Jay Pritzker Pavilion (2004) adjacent to Millennium Park in Chicago,  and the understated New World Center (2011) in Miami Beach, which the LA Times called "a piece of architecture that dares you to underestimate it or write it off at first glance."   Other notable works include academic buildings such as the Stata Center (2004)  at MIT and the Peter B. Lewis Library (2008) at Princeton University,  museums such as the Museum of Pop Culture (2000) in Seattle, Washington,  commercial buildings such as the IAC Building (2007) in New York City,  and residential buildings such as Gehry's first skyscraper, the Beekman Tower at 8 Spruce Street (2011)  in New York City.Several recent and ongoing major works by Gehry around the world include the Dr Chau Chak Wing Building in the University of Technology Sydney, completed in 2014.    The Chau Chak Wing, with its 320,000 bricks in "sweeping lines" is described as "10 out of 10" on a scale of difficulty.    An ongoing project is the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi on Saadiyat Island in the United Arab Emirates.  Other significant projects such as the Mirvish Towers in Toronto,  and a multi-decade renovation of the Philadelphia Museum of Art are currently in the design stage. In October 2013, Gehry was appointed joint architect with Foster + Partners to design the "High Street" phase of the development of Battersea Power Station in London, Gehry's first project there. However, in recent years, some of Gehry's more prominent designs have failed to go forward. In addition to unrealized designs such as a major Corcoran Art Gallery expansion in Washington, D.C., and a new Guggenheim museum near the South Street Seaport in New York City, Gehry was notoriously dropped by developer Bruce Ratner from the Pacific Park (Brooklyn) redevelopment project and was also dropped in 2014 as the designer of the World Trade Center Performing Arts Center; both of these projects were in New York City.  That said, some stalled projects have recently shown progress: after many years and a dismissal, Gehry was recently reinstated as architect for the Grand Avenue Project in Los Angeles and, though Gehry's controversial    design of the National Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial in Washington, D.C., has been subject to numerous delays during the approval process with the United States Congress, the project was finally approved in 2014 with a modified design.In 2014, two significant, long-awaited museums designed by Gehry opened: the Biomuseo,  a biodiversity museum in Panama City, Panama, and the Fondation Louis Vuitton,    a modern art museum in the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris, France, which opened to some rave reviews. Also in 2014, Gehry was commissioned by River LA, formerly known as the Los Angeles River Revitalization Corporation, a nonprofit group founded by the city of Los Angeles in 2009 to coordinate river policy, to devise a wide-ranging new plan for the river.  In February 2015 the new building for the University of Technology, Sydney was officially opened, with a façade constructed from more than 320,000 hand-placed bricks and glass slabs, and costing AU$180 million. Gehry said he would "never again design a building quite like the "crumpled paper bag".   Gehry told the French newspaper La Croix in November 2016 that President of France François Hollande had assured the architect that he could relocate to France if Donald Trump was elected President of the United States.The following month Gehry said that he had no plans to move.  He and Trump exchanged words in 2010 when Gehry's 8 Spruce Street, originally known as Beekman Tower, was built   taller than the nearby Trump Building, which until then had been New York City's tallest residential building.  Architectural styleSaid to "defy categorisation", Gehry and his work reflects a spirit of experimentation coupled with a respect for the demands of professional practice and has remained largely unaligned with broader stylistic tendencies or movements.    With his earliest educational influences rooted in modernism, Gehry's work has sought to escape modernist stylistic tropes while still remaining interested in some of its underlying transformative agendas. Continually working between given circumstances and unanticipated materializations, he has been assessed as someone who "made us produce buildings that are fun, sculpturally exciting, good experiences" although his approach may become "less relevant as pressure mounts to do more with less". Gehry is sometimes associated with what is known as the "Los Angeles School" or the "Santa Monica School" of architecture. The appropriateness of this designation and the existence of such a school, however, remains controversial due to the lack of a unifying philosophy or theory. This designation stems from the Los Angeles area's producing a group of the most influential postmodern architects, including such notable Gehry contemporaries as Eric Owen Moss and Pritzker Prize-winner Thom Mayne of Morphosis, as well as the famous schools of architecture at the Southern California Institute of Architecture (co‑founded by Mayne), UCLA, and USC where Gehry is a member of the board of directors. Gehry's style at times seems unfinished or even crude, but his work is consistent with the California "funk" art movement in the 1960s and early 1970s, which featured the use of inexpensive found objects and non-traditional media such as clay to make serious art.    Gehry has been called "the apostle of chain-link fencing and corrugated metal siding".  However, a retrospective exhibit at New York's Whitney Museum in 1988 revealed that he is also a sophisticated classical artist, who knows European art history and contemporary sculpture and painting.

In the first 12 months after the museum was opened, an estimated US$160 million were added to the Basque economy. Indeed, over $3.5 billion has been added to the Basque economy since the building opened.  In subsequent years there have been many attempts to replicate this effect through large-scale eye-catching architectural commissions that have been both successful and unsuccessful, such as Daniel Libeskind's expansion of the Denver Art Museum and buildings by Gehry himself such as the almost universally well-received Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and the more controversial Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle.  Though some link the concept of the Bilbao Effect to the notion of starchitecture, Gehry has consistently rejected the label of a starchitect.   CriticismThough much of Gehry's work has been well-received, reception of Gehry's work is not always positive. Art historian Hal Foster reads Gehry's architecture as, primarily, in the service of corporate branding.  Criticism of his work includes complaints over design flaws that the buildings waste structural resources by creating functionless forms, do not seem to belong in their surroundings or enhance the public context of their locations, and are apparently designed without accounting for the local climate.   Moreover, the socialist magazine Jacobin pointed out that Gehry's work can be summed up as architecture for the super-wealthy, in the sense that it is expensive, not resourceful, and does not serve the interests of the overwhelming majority. The article criticized Gehry's statement that, “In the world we live in, 98 percent of what gets built and designed today is pure shit.” Other aspects of careerAcademiaIn January 2011, Gehry joined the University of Southern California (USC) faculty, as the Judge Widney Professor of Architecture.  He has since continued in this role at his alma mater. In addition to his position at USC, Gehry has held teaching positions at Harvard University, the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of Toronto, Columbia University, the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, and at Yale University where he is still teaching as of 2017. Though Gehry is often referred to as a "starchitect", Gehry has repeatedly expressed his disdain for the term, insisting instead that he is only an architect.   Steve Sample, President of the University of Southern California, told Gehry that "...After George Lucas, you are our most prominent graduate". , Gehry has received over a dozen honorary degrees from various universities (see #Honorary doctorates).In February 2017, MasterClass announced an online architecture course taught by Gehry that was then released in July. Exhibition designGehry has been involved in exhibition designs at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art dating back to the 1960s. In 1965 Gehry designed the exhibition display for the "Art Treasures of Japan" exhibition at the LACMA. This was followed soon after by the exhibition design for the "Assyrian Reliefs" show in 1966 and the "Billy Al Bengston Retrospective" in 1968. The LACMA then had Gehry design the installation for the "Treasures of Tutankhamen" exhibition in 1978 followed by the "Avant-Garde in Russia 1910–1930" exhibition in 1980. The subsequent year Gehry designed the exhibition for "Seventeen Artists in the 60's" at the LACMA followed soon after by the "German Expressionist Sculpture Exhibition" in 1983. In 1991/92, Gehry designed the installation of the landmark exhibition "Degenerate Art: The Fate of the Avant-Garde in Nazi Germany", which opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and traveled to the Art Institute of Chicago, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the Altes Museum in Berlin.   In 2014, Gehry was asked to design an exhibition on the work of Alexander Calder at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Resnick Pavilion, again invited by the museum's curator Stephanie Barron.  The exhibition began on November 24, 2013, and ran through July 27, 2014.In addition to his long-standing involvement with exhibition design at the LACMA, Gehry has also designed numerous exhibition installations with other institutions. In 1998, "The Art of the Motorcycle" exhibition opened at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum with its installation designed by Gehry. This exhibition subsequently traveled to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao and the Guggenheim Las Vegas.In 2014, he curated an exhibition of photography by his close friend and businessman Peter Arnell that ran from March 5 through April 1 at Milk Studios Gallery in Los Angeles.   Stage designIn 1983, Gehry created the stage design for Lucinda Childs' dance Available Light, set to music by John Adams. It premiered at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles at the "Temporary Contemporary", and was subsequently seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music Opera House in New York City, and the Theatre de la Ville in Paris. The set consisted of two levels angled in relation to each other, with a chain-link backdrop.  The pieces was revived in 2015,  and was performed, among other places, in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, where it was presented by FringeArts, which commissioned the revival. In 2012 Gehry designed the set for the Los Angeles Philharmonic's opera production of Don Giovanni, performed at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.In April 2014 Gehry designed a set for an "exploration of the life and career of Pierre Boulez" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which was performed in November of that year.   Other designsIn addition to architecture, Gehry has made a line of furniture, jewelry for Tiffany & Co., various household items, sculptures, and even a glass bottle for Wyborowa Vodka. His first line of furniture, produced from 1969 to 1973, was called "Easy Edges", constructed out of cardboard. Another line of furniture released in the spring of 1992 is "Bentwood Furniture". Each piece is named after a different hockey term. He was first introduced to making furniture in 1954 while serving in the U.S. Army, where he designed furniture for the enlisted soldiers.In many of his designs, Gehry is inspired by fish. "It was by accident I got into the fish image", claimed Gehry. One thing that sparked his interest in fish was the fact that his colleagues were recreating Greek temples. He said, "Three hundred million years before man was fish....if you gotta go back, and you're insecure about going forward...go back three hundred million years ago. Why are you stopping at the Greeks? So I started drawing fish in my sketchbook, and then I started to realize that there was something in it." As a result of his fascination, the first Fish Lamps were fabricated between 1984 and 1986. They employed wire armatures molded into fish shapes, onto which shards of plastic laminate ColorCore are individually glued. Since the creation of the first lamp in 1984, the fish has become a recurrent motif in Gehry's work, most notably in the Fish Sculpture at La Vila Olímpica del Poblenou in Barcelona (1989–92) and Standing Glass Fish for the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden (1986). Gehry has previously collaborated with luxury jewelry company Tiffany & Co creating six distinct jewelry collections: the Orchid collection, Fish collection, Torque collection, Equus collection, Axis collection and Fold collection. In addition to jewelry, Gehry designed other items including a distinctive collector's chess set as well as a series of tableware items including vases, cups and bowls for the company.   In 2004, Gehry designed the official trophy for the World Cup of Hockey.  He redesigned the trophy for the next tournament in 2016. In 2014, Gehry was one of the 6 "iconoclasts" selected by French fashion house Louis Vuitton to design a piece using their iconic monogram pattern as part of their "Celebrating Monogram" campaign.   In 2015, Gehry designed his first yacht. Software developmentGehry's firm was responsible for innovation in architectural software.  His firm spun off another firm called Gehry Technologies that was established in 2002. In 2005, Gehry Technologies began a partnership with Dassault Systèmes to bring innovations from the aerospace and manufacturing world to AEC and developed Digital Project software as well as GTeam software. In 2014, Gehry Technologies was acquired by software company Trimble Navigation.  Its client list includes Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Herzog & de Meuron, Jean Nouvel, Coop Himmelb(l)au and Zaha Hadid.Personal lifeIn 1952, Gehry (then Goldberg) married Anita Snyder. According to an interview with Gehry on the genealogy program Finding Your Roots, he changed his name in 1956 to Frank O. Gehry in part because of the antisemitism he had experienced as a child and as an undergraduate at USC. Gehry and Snyder divorced in 1966.He married his current wife, Panamanian Berta Isabel Aguilera, in 1975. He has two daughters from his first marriage and two sons from his second marriage.Having grown up in Canada, Gehry is an avid fan of ice hockey. He began a hockey league in his office, FOG (which stands for Frank Owen Gehry), though he no longer plays with them. Goldberger (2015)  In 2004, he designed the trophy for the World Cup of Hockey.  Gehry holds dual citizenship in Canada and the United States. He lives in Santa Monica, California, and continues to practice out of Los Angeles.Gehry is known for his sometimes cantankerous personality. During a trip to Oviedo, Spain, to accept the prestigious Prince of Asturias Award in October 2014, he received a significant amount of attention, both positive and negative, for publicly flipping off a reporter at a press conference who accused him of being a "showy" architect.  Gehry is a member of the California Yacht Club in Marina Del Rey, California, and enjoys sailing with his fiberglass-hulled yacht, "Foggy".    Gehry also serves on the Leadership council of The New York Stem Cell Foundation.   In popular cultureIn 2004, he voiced himself on the children's TV show Arthur, where he helped Arthur and his friends design a new treehouse.  Gehry also voiced himself in the 2005 episode of The Simpsons called "The Seven-Beer Snitch", in which he designs a concert hall for the fictional city of Springfield. Gehry has since voiced that he regrets his appearance since a joke about his design technique has led people to misunderstand his architectural process.   In 2006, filmmaker Sydney Pollack made a documentary about Gehry's work called Sketches of Frank Gehry. The film, which followed Gehry over the course of five years and painted a positive portrait of his character, was well-received critically. In 2009, architecturally-inspired ice cream sandwich company Coolhaus named a cookie and ice cream combination after Gehry. Dubbed the "Frank Behry", it features Strawberries & Cream gelato and snickerdoodle cookies.  Works Exhibitions of Gehry's workIn October 2014, the first major European exhibition of Gehry's work debuted at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, France.  Other museums or major galleries that have done exhibitions on Gehry's architecture or design include the Leo Castelli Gallery in 1983 and the Walker Art Center in 1986 whose exhibition then traveled to the Toronto Harbourfront Museum, the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, the LACMA and the Whitney Museum. Subsequently, further museums that have done major exhibitions on Gehry's work include the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art in 1992, the Gagosian Gallery in 1984, 1992 and 1993, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 2001, the Guggenheim Bilbao in 2002, the Jewish Museum in Manhattan in 2010 and the Milan Triennale, first in 1988 and then in 2010, with an exhibition entitled "Frank Gehry from 1997." In 2015, LACMA held a major retrospective of Gehry's work. Gehry participated in the 1980 Venice Biennale's La Strada Novissima installation. He also contributed to the 1985 Venice Biennale with an installation and performance named Il Corso del Coltello done in collaboration with Claes Oldenburg. His projects were featured in the 1996 Venice Biennale. He subsequently contributed to the 2008 Venice Biennale with the installation Ungapatchket.In October 2015, 21 21 Design Sight in Tokyo held the exhibition Frank Gehry. I Have An Idea, curated by Japanese architect Tsuyoshi Tane.

Cass Gilbert<====>53406<====>Cass Gilbert  Cass Gilbert (November 24, 1859 – May 17, 1934) was a prominent   American architect.An early proponent of skyscrapers in works like the Woolworth Building, Gilbert was also responsible for numerous museums (Saint Louis Art Museum) and libraries (Saint Louis Public Library), state capitol buildings (the Minnesota, Arkansas and West Virginia State Capitols, for example) as well as public architectural icons like the United States Supreme Court building.  His public buildings in the Beaux Arts style reflect the optimistic American sense that the nation was heir to Greek democracy, Roman law and Renaissance humanism. 

Michael Graves<====>53408<====>Michael Graves  Michael Graves (July 9, 1934 – March 12, 2015) was an American architect.   Identified as one of The New York Five, as well as Memphis Group, Graves was known first for his contemporary building designs and some prominent public commissions that became iconic examples of Postmodern architecture, such as the Portland Building and Denver Public Library.  His recognition grew through designing domestic products sold by premium Italian housewares maker Alessi, and later low-cost new designs at stores such as Target and J.  C.  Penney in the United States.   He was a representative of New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture and formerly designed postmodern buildings, and was recognized as a major influence in all three movements. 

Walter Burley Griffin<====>53409<====>Walter Burley Griffin    Walter Burley Griffin (November 24, 1876 February 11, 1937) was an American architect and landscape architect.   He is known for designing Canberra, Australia's capital city.  He has been credited with the development of the L-shaped floor plan, the carport and an innovative use of reinforced concrete. Influenced by the Chicago-based Prairie School, Griffin developed a unique modern style.  He worked in partnership with his wife Marion Mahony Griffin.  In 28 years they designed over 350 buildings, landscape and urban-design projects as well as designing construction materials, interiors, furniture and other household items. 

Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin<====>53410<====>Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin (December 7, 1805 – June 13, 1871) was a French magician.  He is widely considered the father of the modern style of conjuring.  Early life and entrance into conjuringMaster of magic Robert-Houdin was born Jean-Eugène Robert in Blois, France, on 6 December 1805—a day after his autobiography said he was.  Illustrated History of Magic by Milbourne Christopher 1973His father, Prosper Robert, was one of the best watchmakers in Blois.   A skillful artisan and hard worker, Prosper Robert's main ambition was to provide for his family, but he also wanted his children to climb the social ladder. 

Stage name<====>53412<====>Stage name   A stage name is a pseudonym used by performers and entertainers, such as actors, comedians, singers and musicians. Motivation to use a stage nameA performer will often take a stage name because his/her real name is considered unattractive, dull, or unintentionally amusing, is difficult to pronounce or spell, has been used by another notable individual, or projects an undesired image.  Sometimes a performer adopts a name that is unusual or outlandish to attract attention.  Other performers use a stage name in order to retain anonymity.  The equivalent concept among writers is called a nom de plume or pen name. 

Buggery<====>53413<====>Buggery   The British English term buggery is very close in meaning to the term sodomy, often used interchangeably in law and popular speech.   It may also be a specific common law offence encompassing both sodomy and bestiality. In lawIn English law "buggery" was first used in the Buggery Act 1533, while Section 61 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861, entitled "Sodomy and Bestiality", defined punishments for "the abominable Crime of Buggery, committed either with Mankind or with any Animal".  The definition of "buggery" was not specified in these or any statute, but rather established by judicial precedent. 

Cream (band)<====>53414<====>Cream (band)   Cream were   a 1960s British rock power trio consisting of drummer Ginger Baker, guitarist/singer Eric Clapton and bassist/singer Jack Bruce.  The group's third album, Wheels of Fire (1968), was the world's first platinum-selling double album. The band is widely regarded as the world's first successful supergroup. In their career, they sold more than 15 million copies of their albums worldwide.   Their music included songs based on traditional blues such as "Crossroads" and "Spoonful", and modern blues such as "Born Under a Bad Sign", as well as more current material such as "Strange Brew", "Tales of Brave Ulysses" and "Toad". 

Wallace Harrison<====>53416<====>Wallace Harrison Wallace Kirkman Harrison (September 28, 1895 – December 2, 1981) was an American architect. Harrison started his professional career with the firm of Corbett, Harrison & MacMurray, participating in the construction of Rockefeller Center.  He is best known for executing large public projects in New York City and upstate, many of them a result of his long and fruitful personal relationship with Nelson Rockefeller, for whom he served as an adviser.  CareerHarrison's work in the mid-twentieth century comprised large, modernist public projects and office buildings.   As a young man, Harrison took classes in engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and in architecture at the Boston Architectural Club; he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in the early 1920s and worn the Rotch Taveling Scholarship in 1922. 

Raymond Hood<====>53417<====>Raymond Hood  Raymond Mathewson Hood (March 29, 1881 – August 14, 1934)  was an American architect who worked in the Art Deco style. Life and careerHood was born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and attended Brown University before enrolling at MIT.  As a post-graduate, Hood worked as a draftsman at the architecture firm Cram, Goodhue and Ferguson in Boston.  He was accepted into the École des Beaux-Arts in 1911 and earned a degree.  In 1922, New York architect John Mead Howells, who had met him at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, invited Hood to become his partner in the Chicago Tribune building competition in which Howells had been invited to compete. 

Easter Island<====>53418<====>Easter Island   {{Infobox settlement }} Easter Island ( ,  ) is a Chilean  island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle in Oceania.  Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called moai, created by the early Rapa Nui people.  In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park.

It is considered to be one of the world's premier architecture prizes,  and is often referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture. 

Hector Berlioz<====>53424<====>Hector Berlioz   Louis-Hector Berlioz  (  (English:  ); 11 December 1803 – 8 March 1869) was a French Romantic composer, best known for his compositions Symphonie fantastique and Grande messe des morts (Requiem).  Berlioz made significant contributions to the modern orchestra with his Treatise on Instrumentation.  He specified huge orchestral forces for some of his works, and conducted several concerts with more than 1,000 musicians.   He also composed around 50 compositions for voice, accompanied by piano or orchestra.  His influence was critical for the further development of Romanticism, especially in composers like Richard Wagner, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Franz Liszt, Richard Strauss, and Gustav Mahler. 

Pseudonymity<====>53426<====>PseudonymityPseudonymity, a word derived from pseudonym, meaning 'false name', is a state of disguised identity.  The pseudonym identifies a holder, that is, one or more human beings who possess but do not disclose their true names (that is, legal identities).    Most pseudonym holders use pseudonyms because they wish to remain anonymous, but anonymity is difficult to achieve, and is often fraught with legal issues.   True anonymity requires unlinkability, such that an attacker's examination of the pseudonym holder's message provides no new information about the holder's true name.  ExamplesAlthough the term is most frequently used today with regard to identity and the Internet, the concept of pseudonymity has a long history. 

Kenzō Tange<====>53427<====>Kenzō Tange   was a Japanese architect, and winner of the 1987 Pritzker Prize for architecture.  He was one of the most significant architects of the 20th century, combining traditional Japanese styles with modernism, and designed major buildings on five continents.  Tange was also an influential patron of the Metabolist movement.  He said: "It was, I believe, around 1959 or at the beginning of the sixties that I began to think about what I was later to call structuralism", (cited in Plan 2/1982, Amsterdam), a reference to the architectural movement known as Dutch Structuralism. Influenced from an early age by the Swiss modernist, Le Corbusier, Tange gained international recognition in 1949 when he won the competition for the design of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. 

Nickname<====>53430<====>Nickname   A nickname is a substitute for the proper name of a familiar person, place, or thing, for affection or ridicule.

The term diminutive name refers to nicknames that convey smallness, hence something regarded with affection or familiarity (e. g. , referring to children), or contempt.  The distinction between the two is often blurred.  It is a form of endearment and amusement.  As a concept, it is distinct from both pseudonym and stage name, and also from a title (for example, City of Fountains), although there may be overlap in these concepts.

Euler's totient function<====>53452<====>Euler's totient function In number theory, Euler's totient function counts the positive integers up to a given integer   that are relatively prime to  .  It is written using the Greek letter phi as   or  , and may also be called Euler's phi function.  It can be defined more formally as the number of integers   in the range   for which the greatest common divisor   is equal to 1.    The integers   of this form are sometimes referred to as totatives of  . 

Fermat's little theorem<====>53453<====>Fermat's little theorem Fermat's little theorem states that if   is a prime number, then for any integer  , the number   is an integer multiple of  .   In the notation of modular arithmetic, this is expressed as a^p \equiv a \pmod p.  For example, if   = 2 and   = 7, 2 7  = 128, and 128 − 2 = 7 × 18 is an integer multiple of 7. If   is not divisible by  , Fermat's little theorem is equivalent to the statement that   is an integer multiple of  , or in symbols a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod p. 

Minkowski's theorem<====>53455<====>Minkowski's theorem In mathematics, Minkowski's theorem is the statement that any convex set in   which is symmetric with respect to the origin and with volume greater than   contains a non-zero lattice point.  The theorem was proved by Hermann Minkowski in 1889 and became the foundation of the branch of number theory called the geometry of numbers. FormulationSuppose that   is a lattice of determinant   in the  -dimensional real vector space   and   is a convex subset of   that is symmetric with respect to the origin, meaning that if   is in   then   is also in  . 

Quinoa<====>53457<====>Quinoa  Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa; (  or  , from Quechua   or  )  is a flowering plant in the amaranth family.  It is a herbaceous annual plant grown as a grain crop primarily for its edible seeds.   Quinoa is not a grass, but rather a pseudocereal botanically related to spinach and amaranth (Amaranthus spp. ). After harvest, the seeds are processed to remove the bitter-tasting outer seed coat.  Versatile for many dishes, cooked quinoa supplies nutrient content similar to wheat and rice, such as moderate amounts of protein, dietary fiber, and minerals. 

Count noun<====>53458<====>Count noun In linguistics, a  count noun (also countable noun) is a noun that can be modified by a numeral and that occurs in both singular and plural forms, and that co-occurs with quantificational determiners like every, each, several, etc.  A mass noun has none of these properties, because it cannot be modified by a numeral, cannot occur in plural, and cannot co-occur with quantificational determiners. ExamplesBelow are examples of  all the properties of count nouns holding for the count noun chair, but not for the mass noun furniture.  Occurrence in plural/singular. There is a chair in the room.

Illusion<====>53472<====>Illusion An illusion is a distortion of the senses, revealing how the human brain normally organizes and interprets sensory stimulation.  Though illusions distort reality, they are generally shared by most people.  Illusions may occur with any of the human senses, but visual illusions (optical illusions) are the best-known and understood.  The emphasis on visual illusions occurs because vision often dominates the other senses.  For example, individuals watching a ventriloquist will perceive the voice is coming from the dummy since they are able to see the dummy mouth the words.  Some illusions are based on general assumptions the brain makes during perception. 

Tenrikyo<====>53474<====>Tenrikyo  , sometimes rendered as Tenriism,  is a Japanese new religion which is neither strictly monotheistic nor pantheistic, originating from the teachings of a 19th-century woman named Nakayama Miki, known to her followers as Oyasama.

Although it was initially called an asteroid and classified only as a minor planet with the designation "2060 Chiron", it was later found to exhibit behavior typical of a comet. 

Red dog (card game)<====>53480<====>Red dog (card game)Red dog, also known as red dog poker or yablon, is a game of chance played with cards.  It is a variation of acey-deucey or in-between.  While found in some land casinos, its popularity has declined, although it is featured at many casinos online.  Confusingly, there are other card-based games of chance by the same name that are unrelated to the rules described here. The deck used to play red dog is the standard, fifty-two-card variety.  The game may be played with anywhere from one to eight decks, with an increasing number of decks decreasing the house's edge — the house's advantage begins at 3. 

Game of chance<====>53481<====>Game of chanceA game of chance is a game whose outcome is strongly influenced by some randomizing device, and upon which contestants may choose to wager money or anything of monetary value.   Common devices used include dice, spinning tops, playing cards, roulette wheels, or numbered balls drawn from a container.  A game of chance may have some skill element to it, however, chance generally plays a greater role in determining the outcome than skill.  A game of skill, on the other hand, also has an element of chance, but with skill playing a greater role in determining the outcome. 

Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien<====>53483<====>Languages constructed by J.  R.  R.  TolkienThe philologist and author J.  R.  R.  Tolkien created a number of constructed languages.  Inventing languages  (called glossopoeia by Tolkien, from Greek γλώσσα glôssa, "language, tongue" and ποιῶ poiô, "to make" paralleling his idea of mythopoeia or myth-making) was a lifelong occupation for Tolkien, starting in his teens.  in his early teens, Tolkien was first acquainted with the idea of a constructed language in the form of Animalic, an invention of his cousins, Mary and Marjorie Incledon.  At that time, he was studying Latin and Anglo-Saxon. 

Narwhal<====>53484<====>NarwhalThe narwhal (Monodon monoceros), or narwhale, is a medium-sized toothed whale that possesses a large "tusk" from a protruding canine tooth.

Optical illusion<====>53497<====>Optical illusion An optical illusion (also called a visual illusion )is an illusion caused by the visual system and characterized by a visual percept that (loosely said) appears to differ from reality.  Illusions come in a wide variety; their categorization is difficult because the underlying cause is often not clear    but a classification  proposed by Richard Gregory is useful as an orientation.  According to that, there are three main classes: physical, physiological, and cognitive illusions, and in each class there are four kinds: Ambiguities, distortions, paradoxes, and fictions.  A classical example for a physical distortion would be the apparent bending of a stick half immerged in water; an example for a physiological paradox is the motion aftereffect (where despite movement position remains unchanged). 

Monospaced font<====>53501<====>Monospaced font   A monospaced font, also called a fixed-pitch, fixed-width, or non-proportional font, is a font whose letters and characters each occupy the same amount of horizontal space.   This contrasts with variable-width fonts, where the letters and spacings have different widths.  Monospaced fonts are customary on typewriters and for typesetting computer code. Use in computersMonospaced fonts were widely used in early computers and computer terminals, which often had extremely limited graphical capabilities.   Hardware implementation was simplified by using a text mode where the screen layout was addressed as a regular grid of tiles, each of which could be set to display a character by indexing into the hardware's character map.

Group object<====>53507<====>Group objectIn category theory, a branch of mathematics, group objects are certain generalizations of groups which are built on more complicated structures than sets.  A typical example of a group object is a topological group, a group whose underlying set is a topological space such that the group operations are continuous.

Village<====>53509<====>Village  A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand.  Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighborhoods.  Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur.  Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. In the past, villages were a usual form of community for societies that practice subsistence agriculture, and also for some non-agricultural societies. 

Catatonia (band)<====>53510<====>Catatonia (band)Catatonia were an alternative rock band from Wales who gained popularity in the mid- to late 1990s.  The band formed in 1992 after Mark Roberts met Cerys Matthews.  The first major lineup featured Dafydd Ieuan on drums, Clancy Pegg on keyboard, Owen Powell on guitar and Paul Jones on bass.  They recorded two EPs, For Tinkerbell and Hooked. Pegg was fired prior to work on their first studio album, Way Beyond Blue, while Ieuan was replaced with Aled Richards shortly afterwards.  This new line-up remained for the rest of the lifetime of the band. 

Paper Scissors Stone (album)<====>53513<====>Paper Scissors Stone (album)    Paper Scissors Stone was the fourth and final album by Welsh band Catatonia.  It was released on 6 August 2001 in the UK, and reached #6 on the UK album chart. The album only had one single taken from it, "Stone by Stone" – the group's final single release.  Fittingly, the ending of the video for the song features the band members all abandoning their instruments and walking away.  The band had announced on their website that the next single was to be the rocky "Is Everybody Here On Drugs", although the announcement was quickly removed once it was clear that Catatonia had reached the end of the road.

Theatre of Poland<====>53519<====>Theatre of Poland  In common with other European countries, the most frequent and most popular form of theatre in Poland is dramatic theatre, based on the existence of relatively stable artistic companies.  It is above all a theatre of directors, who decide on the form of its productions and the appearance of individual scenes.  There is no strict division in Poland between theatre and film directors and actors, therefore many stage artists are known to theatre goers from films of Andrzej Wajda, for example: Wojciech Pszoniak, Daniel Olbrychski, Krystyna Janda, Jerzy Radziwiłowicz, and from films of Krzysztof Kieślowski, actors such as Jerzy Stuhr, Janusz Gajos and others. 

Jerzy Grotowski<====>53520<====>Jerzy Grotowski Jerzy Marian Grotowski ( ; 11 August 1933 – 14 January 1999) was an innovative Polish theatre director and theorist whose approaches to acting, training and theatrical production have significantly influenced theatre today.

GameCube<====>53525<====>GameCube  The GameCube  is a   home video game console released by Nintendo in Japan on September 14, 2001; in North America on November 18, 2001; in Europe on May 3, 2002; and in Australia on May 17, 2002.  The sixth-generation console is the successor to the Nintendo 64 and competed with Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation 2 and Microsoft's Xbox. The GameCube is the first Nintendo console to use optical discs as its primary storage medium.  The discs are similar to the miniDVD format; as a result of their smaller size and the console's small disc compartment, the system was not designed to play standard DVDs or audio CDs. 

David Livingstone<====>53528<====>David LivingstoneDavid Livingstone  ( ; 19 March 1813 – 1 May 1873) was a Scottish Christian Congregationalist, pioneer medical missionary  with the London Missionary Society, an explorer in Africa, and one of the most popular British heroes of the late-19th-century in the Victorian era.  He had a mythical status that operated on a number of interconnected levels: Protestant missionary martyr, working-class "rags-to-riches" inspirational story, scientific investigator and explorer, imperial reformer, anti-slavery crusader, and advocate of commercial and colonial expansion. His fame as an explorer and his obsession with discovering the sources of the Nile River was founded on the belief that if he could solve that age-old mystery, his fame would give him the influence to end the East African Arab-Swahili slave trade. 

Gruyère cheese<====>53530<====>Gruyère cheese  Gruyère (  or  ;  , German: Greyerzer) is a hard yellow cheese that originated in the cantons of Fribourg, Vaud, Neuchâtel, Jura, and Bern in Switzerland, and is named after the town of Gruyères.  Before 2001, when Gruyère gained the appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC, now AOP) status as a Swiss cheese, some controversy existed whether French cheeses of a similar nature could also be labelled Gruyère (French Gruyère-style cheeses include Comté and Beaufort). Gruyère is sweet but slightly salty, with a flavor that varies widely with age.  It is often described as creamy and nutty when young, becoming more assertive, earthy, and complex as it matures. 

Dorset Blue Vinney<====>53533<====>Dorset Blue Vinney Dorset Blue Vinney (frequently spelled "vinny") is a traditional blue cheese made near Sturminster Newton in Dorset, England, from skimmed cows' milk.  It is a hard, crumbly cheese.  "Vinney" is a local Dorset term related to the obsolete word "vinew", which means to become mouldy.  Another explanation has it that "vinny" is a corruption of "veiny", referring to the blue veins running throughout the cheese. Historically the cheese was merely a by-product of the much more lucrative butter market.  Milk was of little value before the railways as it couldn't be brought to market before it went off, thus cheese and butter production was the main focus of dairy farms.

Domestication of the horse<====>53543<====>Domestication of the horseA number of hypotheses exist on many of the key issues regarding the domestication of the horse.  Although horses appeared in Paleolithic cave art as early as 30,000 BCE, these were wild horses and were  probably hunted for meat.  How and when horses became domesticated is disputed.  The clearest evidence of early use of the horse as a means of transport is from chariot burials dated c.  2000 BCE.  However, an increasing amount of evidence supports the hypothesis that horses were domesticated in the Eurasian Steppes approximately 3500 BCE; recent discoveries in the context of the Botai culture suggest that Botai settlements in the Akmola Province of Kazakhstan are the location of the earliest domestication of the horse. 

Crab canon<====>53544<====>Crab canonA crab canon (also known by the Latin form of the name, canon cancrizans; as well as retrograde canon, canon per recte et retro or canon per rectus et inversus ) is an arrangement of two musical lines that are complementary and backward, similar to a palindrome.  Originally it is a musical term for a kind of canon in which one line is reversed in time from the other (e. g.  FABACEAE played simultaneously with EAECABAF).    A famous example is found in J.  S.  Bach's The Musical Offering, which also contains a canon ("Quaerendo invenietis") combining retrogression with inversion, i.

Mnemonic link system<====>53547<====>Mnemonic link systemA mnemonic link system, sometimes also known as a chain method, is a method of remembering lists that is based on creating an association between the elements of that list.  For example, when memorizing the list (dog, envelope, thirteen, yarn, window), one could create a story about a "dog stuck in an envelope, mailed to an unlucky thirteen black cat playing with yarn by the window".  It is argued that the story would be easier to remember than the list itself. Another method is to actually link each element of the list with a mental picture of an image that includes two elements in the list that are next to each other. 

Charadriiformes<====>53551<====>Charadriiformes Charadriiformes is a diverse order of small to medium-large birds.  It includes about 350 species and has members in all parts of the world.

Mnemonic peg system<====>53555<====>Mnemonic peg systemThe mnemonic peg system, invented by Henry Herdson  is a memory aid that works by creating mental associations between two concrete objects in a one-to-one fashion that will later be applied to to-be-remembered information.    Typically this involves linking nouns to numbers  and it is common practice to choose a noun that rhymes with the number it is associated with.    These will be the pegs of the system.  These associations have to be memorized one time and can be applied repeatedly to new information that needs to be memorized. 

Dominic system<====>53557<====>Dominic system The Dominic system is a mnemonic system used to remember sequences of digits similar to the mnemonic major system.   It was invented and used in competition by eight-time World Memory Champion Dominic O'Brien.Differences from the major systemThe main difference between the Dominic system and the major system is the assignment of sounds and letters to digits.  The Dominic system is a letter-based abbreviation system where the letters comprise the initials of someone's name, while the major system is typically used as a phonetic-based consonant system for either objects, animals, persons, or even words.

Passive review<====>53585<====>Passive review Passive review is the opposite of active recall, in which the learning material is processed passively (e. g.  by reading, watching, etc. ). For example, to improve memory through passive review, an individual may read a text today; to not forget it, it is repeated tomorrow and then 4 days later and then 8, 16, 32, 64, etc. , days later.  They don't ask themselves to explain the content of the text, but only reread the content.  If they think to recall something, they are more likely to keep it in their memory.  Passive review is a simple method but it is not as effective.

Double star<====>53603<====>Double star In observational astronomy, a double star or visual double is a pair of stars that appear close to each other in the sky as seen from Earth when viewed through an optical telescope. This can happen either because the pair forms a binary star, i. e.  a binary system of stars in mutual orbit, gravitationally bound to each other, or because it is an optical double, a chance line-of-sight-alignment of two stars in the sky that lie at different distances.

Binary stars are important to stellar astronomers as knowledge of their motions allows direct calculation of stellar mass and other stellar parameters. 

Adolf Loos<====>53604<====>Adolf Loos  Adolf Franz Karl Viktor Maria Loos (10 December 1870 – 23 August 1933) was an Austrian and Czech architect and influential European theorist of modern architecture.  His essay Ornament and Crime advocated smooth and clear surfaces in contrast to the lavish decorations of the fin de siècle and also to the more modern aesthetic principles of the Vienna Secession.  Loos became a pioneer of modern architecture and contributed a body of theory and criticism of Modernism in architecture and design. Loos had three tumultuous marriages that all ended in divorce.  He suffered from poor health, including an inherited hearing affliction, and was involved in a pedophilia scandal. 

List of science-fiction authors<====>53606<====>List of science-fiction authors Note that this partial list contains some authors whose works of fantastic fiction would today be called science fiction, even if they predate or did not work in that genre.  There is also a considerable overlap with the List of fantasy authors, since many authors are equally comfortable with both genres, and since some works deliberately combine the two or blur the distinction.  Most science-fiction authors write as novelists or short-story writers, and in the 21st century, often as  playwrights or screen writers. Some notable science-fiction authors are (in alphabetical order): A Dafydd ab Hugh (born 1960)Alexander Abasheli (1884–1954)Edwin Abbott Abbott (1838–1926)Kōbō Abe (1924–1993)Robert Abernathy (1924–1990)Dan Abnett (born 1965)Daniel Abraham (born 1969)Forrest J Ackerman (1916–2008)Douglas Adams (1952–2001)Robert Adams (1932–1990)Ann Aguirre (born 1970)Jerry Ahern (1946–2012)Humayun Ahmed (born 1948)Jim Aikin (born 1948)Alan Burt Akers (1921–2005) (pseudonym of Kenneth Bulmer)Brian Aldiss (1925–2017)David M.

Puffin<====>53620<====>Puffin   Puffins are any of three small species of alcids (auks) in the bird genus Fratercula with a brightly coloured beak during the breeding season.  These are pelagic seabirds that feed primarily by diving in the water.  They breed in large colonies on coastal cliffs or offshore islands, nesting in crevices among rocks or in burrows in the soil.  Two species, the tufted puffin and horned puffin, are found in the North Pacific Ocean, while the Atlantic puffin is found in the North Atlantic Ocean. All puffin species have predominantly black or black and white plumage, a stocky build, and large beaks. 

Robert Venturi<====>53621<====>Robert Venturi Robert Charles Venturi Jr.  (born June 25, 1925) is an American architect, founding principal of the firm Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates, and one of the major architectural figures in the twentieth century.  Together with his wife and partner, Denise Scott Brown, he helped to shape the way that architects, planners and students experience and think about architecture and the American built environment.  Their buildings, planning, theoretical writings, and teaching have also contributed to the expansion of discourse about architecture. Venturi was awarded the Pritzker Prize in Architecture in 1991; the prize was awarded to him alone, despite a request to include his equal partner Denise Scott Brown. 

Auk<====>53622<====>Auk  An auk or alcid is a bird of the family Alcidae in the order Charadriiformes.  The alcid family includes the murres, guillemots, auklets, puffins, and murrelets. Apart from the extinct great auk, all auks are notable for their ability to "fly" under water as well as in the air.  Although they are excellent swimmers and divers, their walking appears clumsy. Several species have different common names in Europe and North America.  The guillemots of Europe are referred to as murres in North America, if they occur in both continents, and the little auk is referred to as the dovekie.

From 1957 until his death, he was a professor of architecture at the School of Design at the University of Pennsylvania. Kahn created a style that was monumental and monolithic; his heavy buildings for the most part do not hide their weight, their materials, or the way they are assembled. 

Lipogram<====>53629<====>Lipogram A lipogram (from  , leipográmmatos, "leaving out a letter") is a kind of constrained writing or word game consisting of writing paragraphs or longer works in which a particular letter or group of letters is avoided—usually a common vowel, and frequently E, the most common letter in the English language.  McArthur, Tom (1992).  The Oxford Companion to the English Language, p. 612.  Oxford University Press.Larousse defines a lipogram as a "literary work in which one compels oneself strictly to exclude one or several letters of the alphabet".   Extended Ancient Greek texts avoiding the letter sigma are the earliest examples of lipograms. 

Werner von Siemens<====>53630<====>Werner von Siemens   Ernst Werner Siemens (von Siemens from 1888;  ; 13 December 1816 – 6 December 1892) was a German inventor and industrialist.  Siemens’s name has been adopted as the SI unit of electrical conductance, the siemens.  He was also the founder of the electrical and telecommunications company Siemens. BiographyEarly yearsErnst Werner Siemens was born in Lenthe, today part of Gehrden, near Hannover, in the Kingdom of Hanover in the German Confederation, the fourth child (of fourteen) of a tenant farmer of the Siemens family, an old family of Goslar, documented since 1384.

Odonata<====>53635<====>Odonata Odonata is an order of carnivorous insects, encompassing the dragonflies (Anisoptera) and the damselflies (Zygoptera).  The Odonata form a clade, which has existed since the Triassic. Dragonflies are generally larger, and perch with their wings held out to the sides; damselflies have slender bodies, and hold their wings over the body at rest. Etymology and terminologyFabricius coined the term Odonata from the Greek οδόντoς (οδούς), odontos (tooth) apparently because they have teeth on their mandibles, even though most insects also have toothed mandibles.  The word dragonfly is also sometimes used to refer to all Odonata, but odonate is a more correct English name for the group as a whole. 

Constrained writing<====>53640<====>Constrained writingConstrained writing is a literary technique in which the writer is bound by some condition that forbids certain things or imposes a pattern.    Constraints are very common in poetry, which often requires the writer to use a particular verse form. DescriptionThe most common constrained forms of writing are strict restrictions in vocabulary, e. g.  Basic English, copula-free text, defining vocabulary for dictionaries, and other limited vocabularies for teaching English as a Second Language or to children.  This is not generally what is meant by “constrained writing” in the literary sense, which is motivated by more aesthetics. 

Peccary<====>53662<====>Peccary  A peccary (also javelina or skunk pig) is a medium-sized hoofed mammal of the family Tayassuidae (New World pigs) in the suborder Suina along with the Old World pigs, Suidae.  They are found throughout Central and South America and in the southwestern area of North America.  Peccaries usually measure between   in length, and a full-grown adult usually weighs about  . Peccaries, which are native to the Americas, are often confused   "many people confuse them with domestic pigs gone wild"  with the pig family that originated in Afro-Eurasia, especially since some domestic pigs brought by European settlers have escaped over the years and now run wild as "razorback" hogs in many parts of the United States. 

Kingdom (biology)<====>53664<====>Kingdom (biology) In biology, kingdom (Latin: regnum, plural regna) is the second highest taxonomic rank, just below domain.  Kingdoms are divided into smaller groups called phyla.  Traditionally, some textbooks from the United States used a system of six kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, Archaea/Archaeabacteria, and Bacteria/Eubacteria) while textbooks in Great Britain, India, Australia, Latin America and other countries used five kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista and Monera).  Some recent classifications based on modern cladistics have explicitly abandoned the term "kingdom", noting that the traditional kingdoms are not monophyletic, i. e. , do not consist of all the descendants of a common ancestor.

Methuselah's Children<====>53673<====>Methuselah's Children Methuselah's Children is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A.  Heinlein, originally serialized in Astounding Science Fiction in the July, August, and September 1941 issues.  It was expanded into a full-length novel in 1958. The novel is usually considered to be part of Heinlein's Future History series of stories.  It introduces the Howard Families, a fictional group of people who achieved long lifespans through selective breeding.  The space ship in this novel, the New Frontiers, is described in the Future History timeline as a second generation ship, following the Vanguard, the vehicle for Heinlein's paired novellas "Universe" and "Common Sense". 

Hartford, Connecticut<====>53678<====>Hartford, Connecticut   Hartford is the capital of the U. S.  state of Connecticut.  It was the seat of Hartford County until Connecticut disbanded county government in 1960.   As of the 2010 Census, Hartford's population was 124,775, making it Connecticut's third-largest city after the coastal cities of Bridgeport and New Haven.  Census Bureau estimates since then have indicated Hartford's fall to fourth place statewide, as a result of sustained population growth in the coastal city of Stamford.  Hartford is nicknamed the "Insurance Capital of the World", as it hosts many insurance company headquarters and insurance is the region's major industry. 

Strategy game<====>53680<====>Strategy game A strategy game or strategic game is a game (e. g.  video or board game) in which the players' uncoerced, and often autonomous decision-making skills have a high significance in determining the outcome.  Almost all strategy games require internal decision tree style thinking, and typically very high situational awareness. The term "strategy" comes ultimately from Greek, (στρατηγια or  strategia) meaning generalship.   It differs from "tactics" in that it refers to the general scheme of things, whereas "tactics" refers to organization and execution.  HistoryThe history of turn-based strategy games goes back to the times of ancient civilizations such as Rome, Greece, Egypt, and India. 

Calligraphy<====>53682<====>Calligraphy   Calligraphy (from Greek: καλλιγραφία) is a visual art related to writing.  It is the design and execution of lettering with a broad tip instrument,  brush, or other writing instruments.    A contemporary calligraphic practice can be defined as, "the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious, and skillful manner".   Modern calligraphy ranges from functional inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the letters may or may not be readable.    Classical calligraphy differs from typography and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may practice both.    CD-ROM Calligraphy continues flourishing in the forms of wedding invitations and event invitations, font design and typography, original hand-lettered logo design, religious art, announcements, graphic design and commissioned calligraphic art, cut stone inscriptions, and memorial documents. 

Nuclear fallout<====>53683<====>Nuclear fallout   Nuclear fallout, or simply fallout, is the residual radioactive material propelled into the upper atmosphere following a nuclear blast, so called because it "falls out" of the sky after the explosion and the shock wave have passed.   It commonly refers to the radioactive dust and ash created when a nuclear weapon explodes.  Fallout may get entrained with the products of a pyrocumulus cloud and fall as black rain  (rain darkened by soot and other particulates). This radioactive dust, usually consisting of fission products mixed with bystanding atoms that are neutron activated by exposure, is a highly dangerous kind of radioactive contamination. 

Archimedes' screw<====>53686<====>Archimedes' screwThe Archimedes' screw, also called the Archimedean screw or screwpump, is a machine historically used for transferring water from a low-lying body of water into irrigation ditches.  Water is pumped by turning a screw-shaped surface inside a pipe.  HistoryThe screw pump is commonly attributed to Archimedes,    on the occasion of his visit to Egypt.  This tradition may reflect only that the apparatus was unknown to the Greeks before Hellenistic times and was introduced in Archimedes's lifetime by unknown engineers.Depictions of Greek and Roman water screws show them being powered by a human treading on the outer casing to turn the entire apparatus as one piece, which would require that the casing be rigidly attached to the screw.

Physical Quality of Life Index<====>53690<====>Physical Quality of Life Index The Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI) is an attempt to measure the quality of life or well-being of a country.  The value is the average of three statistics: basic literacy rate, infant mortality, and life expectancy at age one, all equally weighted on a 0 to 100 scale. It was developed for the Overseas Development Council in the mid-1970s by Morris David Morris, as one of a number of measures created due to dissatisfaction with the use of GNP as an indicator of development.  PQLI might be regarded as an improvement but shares the general problems of measuring quality of life in a quantitative way. 

Payola<====>53692<====>Payola  Payola, in the music industry, is the illegal practice of payment or other inducement by record companies for the broadcast of recordings on commercial radio in which the song is presented as being part of the normal day's broadcast.  Under US law, a radio station can play a specific song in exchange for money, but this must be disclosed on the air as being sponsored airtime,  and  The term has come to refer to any secret payment made to cast a product in a favorable light (such as obtaining positive reviews). Some radio stations report spins of the newest and most popular songs to industry publications. 

Pig iron<====>53694<====>Pig iron Pig iron is an intermediate product of the iron industry.  Pig iron has a very high carbon content, typically 3. 8–4. 7%,    along with silica and other constituents of dross, which makes it very brittle, and not useful directly as a material except for limited applications.  Pig iron is made by smelting iron ore into a transportable ingot of impure high carbon-content iron in a blast furnace as an ingredient for further processing steps.The traditional shape of the molds used for pig iron ingots was a branching structure formed in sand, with many individual ingots at right angles  to a central channel or runner, resembling a litter of piglets being suckled by a sow. 

Division (mathematics)<====>53696<====>Division (mathematics)   Division is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic, the others being addition, subtraction, and multiplication.  The division of two natural numbers is the process of calculating the number of times one number is contained within another one.    For example, in the picture on the right, the 20 apples are divided into groups of five apples, and there exist four groups, meaning that five can be contained within 20 four times, or  .  Division can also be thought of as the process of evaluating a fraction, and fractional notation (  and  ) is commonly used to represent division. 

Universal Product Code<====>53700<====>Universal Product CodeThe Universal Product Code (UPC) is a barcode symbology that is widely used in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, in Europe and other countries for tracking trade items in stores. UPC (technically refers to UPC-A) consists of 12 numeric digits, that are uniquely assigned to each trade item.  Along with the related EAN barcode, the UPC is the barcode mainly used for scanning of trade items at the point of sale, per GS1 specifications.   UPC data structures are a component of GTINs and follow the global GS1 specification, which is based on international standards.

Wilhelm Keitel<====>53703<====>Wilhelm Keitel   Wilhelm Keitel (22 September 1882 – 16 October 1946) was a German field marshal who served as Chief of the Armed Forces High Command (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht or OKW)  in Nazi Germany during World War II.  According to David Stahel,  Keitel was "well known and [. . . ] reviled as Hitler's dependable mouthpiece and habitual yes-man" among his military colleagues.   Following the war, Keitel was charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg.  He was found guilty, sentenced to death and executed in 1946. 

Treaty on European Union<====>53704<====>Treaty on European Union    The Treaty on European Union (2007) is one of the primary Treaties of the European Union, alongside the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).  The TEU forms the basis of EU law, by setting out general principles of the EU's purpose, the governance of its central institutions (such as the Commission, Parliament, and Council), as well as the rules on external, foreign and security policy. HistoryWhile the current version of the TEU entered into force in 2009, following the Treaty of Lisbon (2007), the older form of the same document was implemented by the Treaty of Maastricht (1992). 

Oulipo<====>53705<====>Oulipo Oulipo ( , short for  ; roughly translated: "workshop of potential literature") is a loose gathering of (mainly) French-speaking writers and mathematicians who seek to create works using constrained writing techniques.  It was founded in 1960 by Raymond Queneau and François Le Lionnais.  Other notable members have included novelists Georges Perec and Italo Calvino, poets Oskar Pastior, Jean Lescure and poet/mathematician Jacques Roubaud. The group defines the term littérature potentielle as (rough translation): "the seeking of new structures and patterns which may be used by writers in any way they enjoy. "Constraints are used as a means of triggering ideas and inspiration, most notably Perec's "story-making machine", which he used in the construction of Life A User's Manual. 

Wage slavery<====>53706<====>Wage slavery Wage slavery is a pejorative term used to draw an analogy between slavery and wage labor by focusing on similarities between owning and renting a person.  It is usually used to refer to a situation where a person's livelihood depends on wages or a salary, especially when the dependence is total and immediate.The term wage slavery has been used to criticize exploitation of labour and social stratification, with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labor and capital (particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages,  e. g.  in sweatshops),  and the latter as a lack of workers' self-management, fulfilling job choices, and leisure in an economy.

Hope Diamond<====>53709<====>Hope Diamond The Hope Diamond is one of the most famous jewels in the world, with ownership records dating back almost four centuries.  Its much-admired rare blue color is due to trace amounts of boron atoms.  Weighing 45. 52 carats, its exceptional size has revealed new findings about the formation of gemstones.  The jewel is believed to have originated in India, where the original (larger) stone was purchased in 1666 by French gem merchant Jean-Baptiste Tavernier as the Tavernier Blue.   The Tavernier Blue was cut and yielded the French Blue (Le bleu de France), which Tavernier sold to King Louis XIV in 1668. 

Henri Becquerel<====>53711<====>Henri Becquerel   Antoine Henri Becquerel (15 December 1852 – 25 August 1908) was a French physicist, Nobel laureate, and the first person to discover evidence of radioactivity.  For work in this field he, along with Marie Skłodowska-Curie and Pierre Curie,   received the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics.  The SI unit for radioactivity, the becquerel (Bq), is named after him. BiographyEarly lifeBecquerel was born in Paris into a rich family which produced four generations of scientists: Becquerel's grandfather (Antoine César Becquerel), father (Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel), and son (Jean Becquerel).   He studied engineering at the École Polytechnique and the École des Ponts et Chaussées. 

Digital audio<====>53712<====>Digital audio  Digital audio is audio, or simply sound, signal that has been recorded as or converted into digital form, where the sound wave of the audio signal is encoded as numerical samples in continuous sequence, typically at CD audio quality which is 16 bit sample depth over 44. 1 thousand samples per second.  Digital audio is the name for the entire technology of sound recording and reproduction using audio signals that have been encoded in digital form.   Following significant advances in digital audio technology during the 1970s, it gradually replaced analog audio technology in many areas of audio engineering and telecommunications in the 1990s and 2000s. 

De Beers<====>53713<====>De Beers   The De Beers Group of Companies is an international corporation that specialises in diamond exploration, diamond mining, diamond retail, diamond trading and industrial diamond manufacturing sectors.  The company is currently active in open-pit, large-scale alluvial, coastal and deep sea mining.   It operates in 35 countries and mining takes place in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Canada.  Until the start of the 21st century, De Beers effectively had total control over the diamond market as a monopoly.   Competition has since dismantled the complete monopoly, though De Beers Group still sells approximately 35%  of the world's rough diamond production through its Global Sightholder Sales and Auction Sales businesses. 

Taos Pueblo<====>53715<====>Taos Pueblo   Taos Pueblo (or Pueblo de Taos) is an ancient pueblo belonging to a Tiwa-speaking Native American tribe of Puebloan people.  It lies about   north of the modern city of Taos, New Mexico, USA.  The pueblos are considered to be one of the oldest continuously inhabited communities in the United States.   This has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Taos Pueblo is a member of the Eight Northern Pueblos, whose people speak two variants of the Tanoan language.  The Taos community is known for being one of the most private, secretive, and conservative pueblos. 

DV<====>53716<====>DV DV is a format for storing digital video. It was launched in 1995 with joint efforts of leading producers of video camera recorders. The original DV specification, known as Blue Book, was standardized within the IEC 61834 family of standards.  These standards define common features such as physical videocassettes, recording modulation method, magnetization, and basic system data in part 1.  Part 2 describes the specifics of 525-60 and 625-50 systems.   The IEC standards are available as publications sold by IEC and ANSI. In 2003,  DV was joined by a successor format HDV, which used the same tape format with a different video codec. 

Taos, New Mexico<====>53717<====>Taos, New Mexico Taos   is a town in Taos County in the north-central region of New Mexico in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, incorporated in 1934.  As of the 2010 census, its population was 5,716.  Other nearby communities include Ranchos de Taos, Cañon, Taos Canyon, Ranchitos, El Prado, and Arroyo Seco.  The town is close to Taos Pueblo, the Native American village and tribe from which it takes its name. Taos is the county seat of Taos County.  The English name Taos derives from the native Taos language meaning "place of red willows". Taos is the principal city of the Taos, NM Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Taos County.

In addition to individual members, seventy national Esperanto organizations are affiliated with UEA.  Its current president is the Canadian professor Mark Fettes.  The magazine Esperanto is the main organ used by UEA to inform its members about everything happening in the Esperanto community. The UEA was founded in 1908 by the Swiss journalist Hector Hodler and others, and is now headquartered in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. 

Life a User's Manual<====>53720<====>Life a User's Manual  Life a User's Manual (the original title is La Vie mode d'emploi) is Georges Perec's most famous novel, published in 1978, first translated into English by David Bellos in 1987.  Its title page describes it as "novels", in the plural, the reasons for which become apparent on reading.  Some critics have cited the work as an example of postmodern fiction, though Perec himself preferred to avoid labels and his only long term affiliation with any movement was with the Oulipo or OUvroir de LIttérature POtentielle. La Vie mode d'emploi is a tapestry of interwoven stories and ideas as well as literary and historical allusions, based on the lives of the inhabitants of a fictitious Parisian apartment block, 11 Rue Simon-Crubellier (no such street exists, although the quadrangle Perec claims Simon-Crubellier cuts through does exist in Paris XVII arrondissement). 

Juan Bautista de Anza<====>53721<====>Juan Bautista de Anza  Juan Bautista de Anza Bezerra Nieto (July 6/7, 1736  – December 19, 1788) was a New-Spanish explorer of Basque descent,  and Governor of New Mexico for the Spanish Crown. Early lifeJuan Bautista de Anza was born in Fronteras, New Navarre, New Spain (today Sonora, Mexico) in 1736 (near Arizpe), into a military family living on the northern frontier of New Spain.  He was the son of Juan Bautista de Anza I.  In 1752 he enlisted in the army at the Presidio of Fronteras.  He advanced rapidly and was a captain by 1760. 

Digital media<====>53723<====>Digital mediaDigital media are any media that are encoded in machine-readable formats.   Digital media can be created, viewed, distributed, modified and preserved on digital electronics devices. Digital MediaExamples of digital media include software, digital images, digital video, video game, web pages and websites, including social media, data and databases, digital audio, such as MP3 and electronic books.  Digital media often contrasts with print media, such as printed books, newspapers and magazines, and other traditional or analog media, such as images, movies or audio tapes.  In combination with the Internet and personal computing, digital media has caused a break in publishing, journalism, entertainment, education, commerce and politics. 

Santa Fe de Nuevo México<====>53724<====>Santa Fe de Nuevo México  Santa Fe de Nuevo México ( ; shortened as Nuevo México or Nuevo Méjico, and translated as New Mexico) was a province of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, and later a territory of independent Mexico.  The United States gained control of the area via the Mexican Cession.   is often incorrectly believed to have taken its name from the nation of Mexico.  However, it was named by Spanish explorers who believed the area contained wealthy Amerindian cultures similar to those of the Aztec Empire (centered in the Valley of Mexico), and called the land the "Santa Fe de Nuevo México". 

Stiff Records<====>53727<====>Stiff Records    Stiff Records is a British independent record label formed in London, England, by Dave Robinson and Jake Riviera (real name Andrew Jakeman).  Originally active from 1976 to 1986, the label was reactivated in 2007. Established at the outset of the punk rock boom, Stiff signed various punk and new wave acts such as Nick Lowe, the Damned, Lene Lovich, Wreckless Eric, Elvis Costello, Ian Dury and Devo.   In the 1980s, with most of their early signings having moved on, the label found commercial success with Madness, The Pogues, Tracey Ullman, The Belle Stars, Kirsty MacColl and others. 

Double-precision floating-point format<====>53734<====>Double-precision floating-point formatDouble-precision floating-point format is a computer number format, usually occupying 64 bits in computer memory; it represents a wide dynamic range of numeric values by using a floating radix point. Floating point is used to represent fractional values, or when a wider range is needed than is provided by fixed point (of the same bit width), even if at the cost of precision.  Double precision may be chosen when the range and/or precision of single precision would be insufficient. In the IEEE 754-2008 standard, the 64-bit base-2 format is officially referred to as binary64; it was called double in IEEE 754-1985.

He began his career on Canadian television at the age of 13, then diversified into American television in the late 1990s.  He was praised for his acting as Sam in Life as a House (2001), earning Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations.  Christensen gained international fame for his portrayal of Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005).  His honors for these films include a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Actor and the Cannes Film Festival Revelation Award. 

Marcian<====>53739<====>Marcian  Marcian ( ;  392 – 27 January 457)  was Byzantine Emperor from 450 to 457.  Marcian's rule marked a recovery of the Eastern Empire, which the Emperor protected from external menaces and reformed economically and financially.  On the other side, the isolationistic policies of Marcian left the Western Roman Empire without help against barbarian attacks, which materialized in the Italian campaigns of Attila and in the Vandal sack of Rome (455). He convoked the Council of Chalcedon, held in 451. BiographyRise to powerMarcian was born in 392  in Illyricum  or Thracia.  Evagrius, II. 

Symmetry<====>53741<====>Symmetry Symmetry (from Greek συμμετρία symmetria "agreement in dimensions, due proportion, arrangement")  in everyday language refers to a sense of harmonious and beautiful proportion and balance.In mathematics, "symmetry" has a more precise definition, that an object is invariant to any of various transformations; including reflection, rotation or scaling.   Although these two meanings of "symmetry" can sometimes be told apart, they are related, so they are here discussed together. Mathematical symmetry may be observed with respect to the passage of time; as a spatial relationship; through geometric transformations; through other kinds of functional transformations; and as an aspect of abstract objects, theoretic models, language, music and even knowledge itself.

Champagne<====>53754<====>Champagne  Champagne ( ) is a type of sparkling wine and type of an alcoholic drink produced from grapes grown in the Champagne region of France following rules that demand, among other things, secondary fermentation of the wine in the bottle to create carbonation, specific vineyard practices, sourcing of grapes exclusively from specific parcels in the Champagne appellation and specific pressing regimes unique to the region.   Most people use the term Champagne as a generic term for sparkling wine,but in many countries, it is illegal to label any product Champagne unless it both comes from the Champagne region and is produced under the rules of the appellation. 

Champagne (wine region)<====>53755<====>Champagne (wine region)The Champagne wine region (archaic  ) is a wine region within the historical province of Champagne in the northeast of France.  The area is best known for the production of the sparkling white wine that bears the region's name.  EU law and the laws of most countries reserve the term "Champagne" exclusively for wines that come from this region located about 100 miles (160 km) east of Paris.  The viticultural boundaries of Champagne are legally defined and split into five wine producing districts within the historical province: Aube, Côte des Blancs, Côte de Sézanne, Montagne de Reims, and Vallée de la Marne. 

Category (mathematics)<====>53759<====>Category (mathematics) In mathematics, a category is an algebraic structure similar to a group but without requiring inverse or closure properties.   It comprises "objects" that are linked by "arrows".  A category has two basic properties: the ability to compose the arrows associatively and the existence of an identity arrow for each object.   A simple example is the category of sets, whose objects are sets and whose arrows are functions.  Category theory is a branch of mathematics that seeks to generalize all of mathematics in terms of categories, independent of what their objects and arrows represent. 

David Niven<====>53762<====>David Niven    James David Graham Niven (1 March 1910 – 29 July 1983)   was an English actor, memoirist and novelist.  His many roles included Squadron Leader Peter Carter in A Matter of Life and Death, Phileas Fogg in Around the World in 80 Days, and Sir Charles Lytton ("the Phantom") in The Pink Panther.  He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in Separate Tables (1958). Born in London, Niven attended Heatherdown Preparatory School and Stowe before gaining a place at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.  After Sandhurst, he joined the British Army and was gazetted a second lieutenant in the Highland Light Infantry. 

The Rubettes<====>53764<====>The Rubettes   The Rubettes were an English pop band assembled of studio session musicians  in 1973 by the songwriting team of Wayne Bickerton, then the head of A&R at Polydor Records, and his co-songwriter, Tony Waddington, after their doo-wop and 1950s American pop-influenced songs had been rejected by a number of existing acts.The band duly emerged at the tail end of the glam rock movement, wearing trademark white suits and cloth caps on stage.   Their first release, "Sugar Baby Love" was an instant hit remaining at number one in the United Kingdom for four weeks in May 1974, while reaching number 37 on the US chart that August,  and remains their best-known record. 

Senufo languages<====>53771<====>Senufo languages The Senufo or Senufic languages (Senoufo in French) has around 15 languages spoken by the Senufo in the north of Ivory Coast, the south of Mali and the southwest of Burkina Faso.  An isolated language, Nafaanra, is also spoken in the west of Ghana.  The Senufo languages constitute their own branch of the Atlantic–Congo sub-family of the Niger–Congo languages.  Garber (1987) estimates the total number of Senufos at some 1. 5 million; the Ethnologue, based on various population estimates, counts 2. 7 million.  The Senufo languages are bounded to the west by Mande languages, to the south by Kwa languages, and to the north and east by Central Gur languages. 

Gur languages<====>53773<====>Gur languages The Gur languages, also known as Central Gur, belong to the Niger–Congo languages.  There are about 70 languages belonging to this group.  They are spoken in the sahelian and savanna regions of West Africa, namely: in Burkina Faso, southern Mali, northeastern Ivory Coast, the northern halves of Ghana and Togo, northwestern Benin, and southwestern Niger; with the easternmost Gur language Baatonun, spoken in the extreme northwest of Nigeria. Like most Niger–Congo languages, the ancestor of Gur languages probably had a noun class system; many of today's languages have reduced this to a system of nominal genders or declensions or no longer have a class system.

Kruskal's algorithm<====>53776<====>Kruskal's algorithm   Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum-spanning-tree algorithm which finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest.It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as it finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph adding increasing cost arcs at each step.   This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.   If the graph is not connected, then it finds a minimum spanning forest (a minimum spanning tree for each connected component). 

Ford–Fulkerson algorithm<====>53777<====>Ford–Fulkerson algorithmThe Ford–Fulkerson method or Ford–Fulkerson algorithm (FFA) is a greedy algorithm that computes the maximum flow in a flow network.  It is called a "method" instead of an "algorithm" as the approach to finding augmenting paths in a residual graph is not fully specified  or it is specified in several implementations with different running times.   It was published in 1956 by L.  R.  Ford, Jr.  and D.  R.  Fulkerson.   The name "Ford–Fulkerson" is often also used for the Edmonds–Karp algorithm, which is a fully defined implementation of the Ford–Fulkerson method. 

Relative permittivity<====>53781<====>Relative permittivity The relative permittivity of a material is its (absolute) permittivity expressed as a ratio relative to the permittivity of vacuum. Permittivity is a material property that affects the Coulomb force between two point charges in the material.  Relative permittivity is the factor by which the electric field between the charges is decreased relative to vacuum. Likewise, relative permittivity is the ratio of the capacitance of a capacitor using that material as a dielectric, compared with a similar capacitor that has vacuum as its dielectric.  Relative permittivity is also commonly known as dielectric constant, a term deprecated in physics and engineering  as well as in chemistry. 

Lake trout<====>53782<====>Lake trout  Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) is a freshwater char living mainly in lakes in northern North America.  Other names for it include mackinaw, lake char (or charr), touladi, togue, and grey trout.  In Lake Superior, it can also be variously known as siscowet, paperbelly and lean.  The lake trout is prized both as a game fish and as a food fish.   Those caught with dark coloration may be called mud hens.  RangeFrom a zoogeographical perspective, lake trout have a relatively narrow distribution.  They are native only to the northern parts of North America, principally Canada, but also Alaska and, to some extent, the northeastern United States. 

Prim's algorithm<====>53783<====>Prim's algorithm In computer science, Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.   This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.  The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time, from an arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another vertex. The algorithm was developed in 1930 by Czech mathematician Vojtěch Jarník  and later rediscovered and republished by computer scientists Robert C. 

Brute-force attack<====>53784<====>Brute-force attack In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker trying many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly.  The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found.  Alternatively, the attacker can attempt to guess the key which is typically created from the password using a key derivation function.  This is known as an exhaustive key search.  A brute-force attack is a cryptanalytic attack that can, in theory, be used to attempt to decrypt any encrypted data  (except for data encrypted in an information-theoretically secure manner). 

Dictionary attack<====>53785<====>Dictionary attack In cryptanalysis and computer security, a dictionary attack is a technique for defeating a cipher or authentication mechanism by trying to determine its decryption key or passphrase by trying hundreds or sometimes millions of likely possibilities, such as words in a dictionary. TechniqueA dictionary attack is based on trying all the strings in a pre-arranged listing, typically derived from a list of words such as in a dictionary (hence the phrase dictionary attack).  Jeff Atwood. "Dictionary Attacks 101".  In contrast to a brute force attack, where a large proportion of the key space is searched systematically, a dictionary attack tries only those possibilities which are deemed most likely to succeed. 

Taiwanese aborigines<====>53787<====>Taiwanese aborigines Taiwanese aborigines or Formosan people ( ) or Austronesian Taiwanese   are the indigenous peoples of Taiwan, who number more than 530,000 and constitute nearly 2. 3% of the island's population.  Recent research suggests their ancestors may have been living on Taiwan for approximately 5,500 years in relative isolation before a major Han immigration began in the 17th century.   Taiwanese aborigines are Austronesian peoples, with linguistic and genetic ties to other Austronesian people.   Related ethnic groups include those of Timor-Leste, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Japan, Madagascar and Oceania.    The issue of an ethnic identity unconnected to the Asian mainland has become one thread in the discourse regarding the political status of Taiwan. 

Feed horn<====>53788<====>Feed horn In parabolic antennas such as satellite dishes, a feed horn (or feedhorn) is a small horn antenna used to convey radio waves between the transmitter and/or receiver and the parabolic reflector.   In transmitting antennas, it is connected to the transmitter and converts the radio frequency alternating current from the transmitter to radio waves and feeds them to the rest of the antenna, which focuses them into a beam.   In receiving antennas, incoming radio waves are gathered and focused by the antenna's reflector on the feed horn, which converts them to a tiny radio frequency voltage which is amplified by the receiver.

TacTix<====>53800<====>TacTix TacTix is a two-player strategy game invented by Piet Hein.  It is essentially a two-dimensional version of Nim.  Players alternate taking pieces away from a square (or rectangular) grid, as many contiguous pieces as desired from a single row or column.  The player who takes the last piece loses (misère play convention). The hexagonal variation of the game, played on a six by six by six board, is called TacTex. On the 4 × 4 grid originally proposed by Hein, the second player will always win with correct play (HAKMEM item #74). If the game is instead played with the normal play convention (player who takes the last piece wins), the second player can always win by symmetrically mirroring the first player's moves.

Visual binary<====>53863<====>Visual binaryA visual binary is a gravitationally bound system  that can be resolved into two stars.  These stars are estimated, via Kepler's 3rd law, to have periods ranging from a number of years to thousands of years.  A visual binary consists of two stars, usually of a different brightness.  Because of this, the brighter star is called the primary and the fainter one is called the companion.  If the primary is too bright, relative to the companion, this can cause a glare making it difficult to resolve the two components.   However, it is possible to resolve the system if observations of the brighter star show it to wobble about a centre of mass.

Modern forestry generally embraces a broad range of concerns, in what is known as multiple-use management, including the provision of timber, fuel wood, wildlife habitat, natural water quality management, recreation, landscape and community protection, employment, aesthetically appealing landscapes, biodiversity management, watershed management, erosion control, and preserving forests as 'sinks' for atmospheric carbon dioxide. 

Herbicide<====>53916<====>Herbicide Herbicide(s), also commonly known as weedkillers, are chemical substances used to control unwanted plants.   Selective herbicides control specific weed species, while leaving the desired crop relatively unharmed, while non-selective herbicides (sometimes called "total weedkillers" in commercial products) can be used to clear waste ground, industrial and construction sites, railways and railway embankments as they kill all plant material with which they come into contact.  Apart from selective/non-selective, other important distinctions include persistence (also known as residual action: how long the product stays in place and remains active), means of uptake (whether it is absorbed by above-ground foliage only, through the roots, or by other means), and mechanism of action (how it works). 

Archetype<====>53917<====>Archetype The concept of an archetype   appears in areas relating to behavior, modern psychological theory, and literary analysis.  An archetype can be:a statement, pattern of behavior, or prototype (model) which other statements, patterns of behavior, and objects copy or emulate.  (Frequently used informal synonyms for this usage include "standard example", "basic example", and the longer form "archetypal example".  Mathematical archetypes often appear as "canonical examples". )a Platonic philosophical idea referring to pure forms which embody the fundamental characteristics of a thing in Platonisma collectively-inherited unconscious idea, pattern of thought, image, etc. , that is universally present, in individual psyches, as in Jungian psychologya constantly recurring symbol or motif in literature, painting, or mythology (this usage of the term draws from both comparative anthropology and from Jungian archetypal theory). 

Musée d'Orsay<====>53919<====>Musée d'Orsay   The Musée d'Orsay ( ) is a museum in Paris, France, on the Left Bank of the Seine.   It is housed in the former Gare d'Orsay, a Beaux-Arts railway station built between 1898 and 1900.  The museum holds mainly French art dating from 1848 to 1914, including paintings, sculptures, furniture, and photography.  It houses the largest collection of impressionist and post-Impressionist masterpieces in the world, by painters including Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, Cézanne, Seurat, Sisley, Gauguin, and Van Gogh.   Many of these works were held at the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume prior to the museum's opening in 1986. 

Beaulieu, Hampshire<====>53922<====>Beaulieu, Hampshire    Beaulieu   is a small village located on the south eastern edge of the New Forest national park in Hampshire, England, and home to both Palace House and the British National Motor Museum. HistoryBeaulieu village has remained largely unspoilt by progress, and is a favourite tourist stop for visitors to the New Forest, and also for birders seeking local specialities like Dartford warbler, European honey buzzard and hobby. Palace House was featured in the 2005 comedy-drama film Mrs.  Palfrey at the Claremont starring Joan Plowright and Rupert Friend. TransportThe nearest railway station is Beaulieu Road, about   away on the London-Weymouth main line. 

Arms and the Man<====>53925<====>Arms and the Man  Arms and the Man is a comedy by George Bernard Shaw, whose title comes from the opening words of Virgil's Aeneid, in Latin:Arma virumque cano ("Of arms and the man I sing"). The play was first produced on 21 April 1894 at the Avenue Theatre and published in 1898 as part of Shaw's Plays Pleasant volume, which also included Candida, You Never Can Tell, and The Man of Destiny.  Arms and the Man was one of Shaw's first commercial successes.  He was called onto stage after the curtain, where he received enthusiastic applause. 

Lucan<====>53926<====>Lucan Marcus Annaeus Lucanus (November 3, 39 AD – April 30, 65 AD), better known in English as Lucan ( ), was a Roman poet, born in Corduba (modern-day Córdoba), in Hispania Baetica.  Despite his short life, he is regarded as one of the outstanding figures of the Imperial Latin period.  His youth and speed of composition set him apart from other poets. LifeThree brief ancient accounts allow for the reconstruction of a modest biography – the earliest attributed to Suetonius, another to an otherwise unknown Vacca, and the third anonymous and undated – along with references in Martial, Cassius Dio, Tacitus's Annals, and one of Statius's Silvae. 

Greibach normal form<====>53928<====>Greibach normal formIn formal language theory, a context-free grammar is in Greibach normal form (GNF) if the right-hand sides of all production rules start with a terminal symbol, optionally followed by some variables.  A non-strict form allows one exception to this format restriction for allowing the empty word (epsilon, ε) to be a member of the described language.  The normal form was established by Sheila Greibach and it bears her name. More precisely, a context-free grammar is in Greibach normal form, if all production rules are of the form: A \to a A_1 A_2 \cdots A_n or S \to \varepsilon where  A  is a nonterminal symbol,  a  is a terminal symbol,  A_1 A_2 \ldots A_n  is a (possibly empty) sequence of nonterminal symbols not including the start symbol,  S  is the start symbol, and ε is the empty word. 

CYK algorithm<====>53929<====>CYK algorithmIn computer science, the Cocke–Younger–Kasami algorithm (alternatively called CYK, or CKY) is a parsing algorithm for context-free grammars, named after its inventors, John Cocke, Daniel Younger and Tadao Kasami.  It employs  bottom-up parsing and dynamic programming. The standard version of CYK operates only on context-free grammars given in Chomsky normal form (CNF).  However any context-free grammar may be transformed to a CNF grammar expressing the same language  . The importance of the CYK algorithm stems from its high efficiency in certain situations.  Using Landau symbols, the worst case running time of CYK is Ο (n^3 \cdot |G|) , where n is the length of the parsed string and |G| is the size of the CNF grammar G  . 

Ulysses (novel)<====>53930<====>Ulysses (novel)  Ulysses is a modernist novel by Irish writer James Joyce.  It was first serialised in parts in the American journal The Little Review from March 1918 to December 1920 and then published in its entirety in Paris by Sylvia Beach on 2 February 1922, Joyce's 40th birthday.  It is considered to be one of the most important works of modernist literature  and has been called "a demonstration and summation of the entire movement".   According to Declan Kiberd, "Before Joyce, no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking".    Ulysses chronicles the peripatetic appointments and encounters of Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary day, 16 June 1904. 

Euclidean distance<====>53932<====>Euclidean distanceIn mathematics, the Euclidean distance or Euclidean metric is the "ordinary" straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.  With this distance, Euclidean space becomes a metric space.  The associated norm is called the Euclidean norm.  Older literature refers to the metric as Pythagorean metric.  A generalized term for the Euclidean norm is the L 2  norm or L 2  distance. DefinitionThe Euclidean distance between points p and q is the length of the line segment connecting them ( \overline{\mathbf{p}\mathbf{q}} ). In Cartesian coordinates, if p = (p 1 , p 2 ,. . . , p n ) and q = (q 1 , q 2 ,. 

Permittivity<====>53933<====>PermittivityIn electromagnetism, permittivity or absolute permittivity, usually denoted by the Greek letter ε (epsilon), is the measure of resistance that is encountered when forming an electric field in a particular medium.  More specifically, permittivity describes the amount of charge needed to generate one unit of electric flux in a particular medium.  Accordingly, a charge will yield more electric flux in a medium with low permittivity than in a medium with high permittivity.  Thus, permittivity is the measure of a material's ability to resist an electric field, not its ability to ‘permit’ it (as the name ‘permittivity’ might seem to suggest). 

Real data type<====>53937<====>Real data type A real data type is a data type used in a computer program to represent an approximation of a real number. Because the real numbers are not countable, computers cannot represent them exactly using a finite amount of information. Most often, a computer will use a rational approximation to a real number. Rational numbers The most general data type for a rational number stores the numerator and denominator as integers. Fixed point numbers A "fixed point" data type assumes a specific denominator for all numbers.  The denominator here is most often a power of two.  For example, in a system whose denominator is 65,536 (2 16 ), the hexadecimal number 0x12345678 means 0x12345678/65536 or 305419896/65536 or 4660 + 22136/65536 or about 4660. 

History of the Czech lands<====>53938<====>History of the Czech lands The history of what are now known as the Czech lands  ( ) is very diverse.  These lands have changed hands many times, and have been known by a variety of different names.  Up until the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy after the First World War, the lands were known as the lands of the Bohemian Crown and formed a constituent state of that empire: the Kingdom of Bohemia (in Czech: "Království české", the word "Bohemia" is a Latin term for Čechy). Prior to the Battle of Mohács, the Kingdom was an independent state within the Holy Roman Empire. 

Euro coins<====>53939<====>Euro coins   The common sides of all 8 euro coins  There are eight euro coin denominations, ranging from one cent to two euros  (the euro is divided into a hundred cents).  The coins first came into use in 2002.  They have a common reverse, portraying a map of Europe, but each country in the eurozone has its own design on the obverse, which means that each coin has a variety of different designs in circulation at once.  Four European microstates which use the euro as their currency also have the right to mint coins with their own designs on the obverse side. 

Triangle inequality<====>53941<====>Triangle inequality In mathematics, the triangle inequality states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the remaining side. If  ,  , and   are the lengths of the sides of the triangle, with no side being greater than  , then the triangle inequality states that z \leq x + y , with equality only in the degenerate case of a triangle with zero area. In Euclidean geometry and some other geometries, the triangle inequality is a theorem about distances, and it is written using vectors and vector lengths (norms): \|\mathbf x + \mathbf y\| \leq \|\mathbf x\| + \|\mathbf y\| , where the length   of the third side has been replaced by the vector sum  . 

XM2001 Crusader<====>53942<====>XM2001 Crusader The XM2001 Crusader was to be the United States Army's next-generation self-propelled howitzer (SPH), designed to improve the survivability, lethality, mobility, and effectiveness of the artillery as well as the overall force.  It was initially scheduled for fielding by 2008.  United Defense was the prime contractor; General Dynamics the major subcontractor.  In early May 2002, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld cancelled the $11 billion USD program because he considered it neither mobile nor precise enough.   The prototype SPH vehicle is on display at the cannon park at Fort Sill. 

Hippocampus<====>53948<====>Hippocampus  The hippocampus (named after its resemblance to the seahorse, from the Greek ἱππόκαμπος, "seahorse" from ἵππος hippos, "horse" and κάμπος kampos, "sea monster") is  a major component of the brains of humans and other vertebrates.  Humans and other mammals have two hippocampi, one in each side of the brain.  The hippocampus belongs to the limbic system and plays important roles in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory, and in spatial memory that enables navigation.  The hippocampus is located under the cerebral cortex (allocortical)    and in primates in the medial temporal lobe. 

Black-and-white colobus<====>53949<====>Black-and-white colobus Black-and-white colobuses (or colobi) are Old World monkeys of the genus Colobus, native to Africa.  They are closely related to the brown colobus monkeys of genus Piliocolobus.  TaxonomyThe word "colobus" comes from Greek κολοβός kolobós ("docked"), and is so named because in this genus, the thumb is a stump.  Colobuses are herbivorous, eating leaves, fruit, flowers, and twigs.  Their habitats include primary and secondary forests, riverine forests, and wooded grasslands; they are found more in higher-density logged forests than in other primary forests.   Their ruminant-like digestive systems have enabled these leaf-eaters to occupy niches that are inaccessible to other primates. 

Diarrhea<====>53951<====>Diarrhea Diarrhea, also spelled diarrhoea, is the condition of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day.   It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss.   Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour.   This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe.   Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are breastfed, however, may be normal. 

Sokoban<====>53953<====>Sokoban  is a type of transport puzzle, in which the player pushes boxes or crates around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations.  The puzzle is usually implemented as a video game. Sokoban was created in 1981 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi, and published in December 1982 by Thinking Rabbit, a software house based in Takarazuka, Japan. RulesThe game is played on a board of squares, where each square is a floor or a wall.  Some floor squares contain boxes, and some floor squares are marked as storage locations. The player is confined to the board, and may move horizontally or vertically onto empty squares (never through walls or boxes). 

Work function<====>53954<====>Work functionIn solid-state physics, the work function (sometimes spelled workfunction) is the minimum thermodynamic work (i. e.  energy) needed to remove an electron from a solid to a point in the vacuum immediately outside the solid surface.  Here "immediately" means that the final electron position is far from the surface on the atomic scale, but still too close to the solid to be influenced by ambient electric fields in the vacuum. The work function is not a characteristic of a bulk material, but rather a property of the surface of the material (depending on crystal face and contamination). 

The Empire Strikes Back<====>53964<====>The Empire Strikes Back    The Empire Strikes Back (also known as Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back)   is a 1980 American epic space opera film directed by Irvin Kershner.  Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan wrote the screenplay, with George Lucas writing the film's story and serving as executive producer.  The second installment in the original Star Wars trilogy, it was produced by Gary Kurtz for Lucasfilm and stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, and Frank Oz. The film is set three years after Star Wars. 

Marc Connelly<====>53967<====>Marc Connelly  Marcus Cook Connelly (13 December 1890 – 21 December 1980) was an American playwright, director, producer, performer, and lyricist.  He was a key member of the Algonquin Round Table, and received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1930. BiographyConnelly was born to actor and hotelier Patrick Joseph Connelly and actress Mabel Louise Cook in McKeesport, Pennsylvania.  He began writing plays at the age of five, and would later become a journalist for the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph until he moved to New York City.  In 1919 he joined the Algonquin Round Table. Connelly had contributed to several Broadway musicals before teaming up with his most important collaborator, George S. 

Otto Harbach<====>53968<====>Otto Harbach Otto Abels Harbach, born Otto Abels Hauerbach (August 18, 1873 – January 24, 1963) was an American lyricist and librettist of about 50 musical comedies.  He was Oscar Hammerstein II's mentor and believed that librettists should integrate songs into the plot.  He is considered one of the first great lyricists, and helped raise the status of the lyricist in an age concerned more with music, costumes, and stars.  Some of his more famous lyrics are for "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes", "Indian Love Call" and "Cuddle up a Little Closer, Lovey Mine". Early life and educationHarbach was born in Salt Lake City, Utah to Danish immigrant parents Adolph Christiansen and his wife Sena Olsen. 

Manchego<====>53971<====>ManchegoManchego (officially  ,  ) is a cheese made in the La Mancha region of Spain from the milk of sheep of the   breed.  Official   cheese is to be aged for between 60 days and two years.   has a firm and compact consistency and a buttery texture, and often contains small, unevenly distributed air pockets.  The colour of the cheese varies from white to ivory-yellow, and the inedible rind from yellow to brownish-beige.  The cheese has a distinctive flavour, well-developed but not too strong, creamy with a slight piquancy, and leaves an aftertaste that is characteristic of sheep's milk. 

Lorenz Hart<====>53972<====>Lorenz Hart Lorenz Milton Hart (May 2, 1895 – November 22, 1943) was the lyricist half of the Broadway songwriting team Rodgers and Hart.  Some of his more famous lyrics include "Blue Moon," "Mountain Greenery," "The Lady Is a Tramp," "Manhattan," "Where or When," "Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered," "Falling in Love with Love," "Have You Met Miss Jones?," "My Funny Valentine," "I Could Write a Book", "This Can't Be Love", "With a Song in My Heart", "It Never Entered My Mind", and "Isn't It Romantic?". Life and careerHart was born in Harlem, the elder of two sons, to Jewish immigrant parents, Max M. 

Mary Rodgers<====>53973<====>Mary Rodgers  Mary Rodgers (January 11, 1931 – June 26, 2014) was an American composer of musicals and an author of children's books.  Early lifeRodgers was born in New York City, New York.  She was a daughter of composer Richard Rodgers and his wife, Dorothy Belle (née Feiner).  She had a sister, Mrs.  Linda Emory.  She attended the Brearley School in Manhattan, and majored in music at Wellesley College.  Eby, Douglas. Mary Rodgers Guettel profile talentdevelop. com; retrieved January 6, 2010.  She began writing music at the age of 16 and her professional career began with writing songs for Little Golden Records, which were albums for children with three-minute songs. 

Legend<====>53974<====>Legend  A legend is a narrative of human actions that are perceived both by teller and listeners to take place within human history and demonstrating human values, and which possesses certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude.   Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of "possibility," but may include miracles.  Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh and vital, and realistic.  Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted. 

Frederick Loewe<====>53975<====>Frederick Loewe Frederick Loewe ( ,  originally German Friedrich (Fritz)  Löwe  ; June 10, 1901 – February 14, 1988 Palm Springs Cemetery District, "Interments of Interest" ), was an Austrian-American composer.  He collaborated with lyricist Alan Jay Lerner on a series of Broadway musicals, including My Fair Lady and Camelot, both of which were made into films. BiographyLoewe was born in Berlin, Germany, to Viennese parents Edmond and Rosa Loewe.  His father was a noted Jewish operetta star who performed throughout Europe and in North and South America; he starred as Count Danilo in the 1906 Berlin production of The Merry Widow. 

Moss Hart<====>53978<====>Moss Hart  Moss Hart (October 24, 1904 – December 20, 1961) was an American playwright and theatre director. Early yearsHart was born in New York City to Barnett Hart, a cigar maker, and Lillian Solomon.    He had a younger brother, Bernard.   The family grew up in relative poverty with his English-born Jewish immigrant parents in the Bronx and in Sea Gate, Brooklyn.  Early on he had a strong relationship with his Aunt Kate, with whom he later lost contact due to a falling out between her and his parents, and Kate's weakening mental state. 

I'd Rather Be Right<====>53979<====>I'd Rather Be Right I'd Rather Be Right is a musical with a book by Moss Hart and George S.  Kaufman, lyrics by Lorenz Hart, and music by Richard Rodgers.   The story is a Depression-era political satire set in New York City, about Washington politics and political figures, such as President Franklin Roosevelt.  The plot centers on Peggy Jones (Joy Hodges) and her boyfriend Phil (Austin Marshall), who needs a raise in order for them to get married.  The President steps in and solves their dilemma. It premiered on Broadway at the Alvin Theatre on November 2, 1937, produced by Sam H. 

Euchromatin<====>53982<====>EuchromatinEuchromatin is a lightly packed form of chromatin (DNA, RNA and protein) that is enriched in genes, and is often (but not always) under active transcription.  Euchromatin comprises the most active portion of the genome within the cell nucleus.  92% of the human genome is euchromatic.   StructureThe structure of euchromatin is reminiscent of an unfolded set of beads along a string, wherein those beads represent nucleosomes.  Nucleosomes consist of eight proteins known as histones, with approximately 147 base pairs of DNA wound around them; in euchromatin, this wrapping is loose so that the raw DNA may be accessed. 

Heterochromatin<====>53983<====>HeterochromatinHeterochromatin is a tightly packed form of DNA, which comes in multiple varieties.  These varieties lie on a continuum between the two extremes of constitutive and facultative heterochromatin.  Both play a role in the expression of genes.  Because it is tightly packed, it was thought to be inaccessible to polymerases and therefore not transcribed, however according to Volpe et al.  (2002),  and many other papers since,  much of this DNA is in fact transcribed, but it is continuously turned over via RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS).  Recent studies with electron microscopy and OsO4 staining reveals that the dense packing is not due to the chromatin. 

Fallacy<====>53986<====>Fallacy A fallacy is the use of invalid or otherwise faulty reasoning, or "wrong moves"  in the construction of an argument.   , The A to Z of Logic (2010:p74).  Rowman & Littlefield,A fallacious argument may be deceptive by appearing to be better than it really is.  Some fallacies are committed intentionally to manipulate or persuade by deception, while others are committed unintentionally due to carelessness or ignorance.  The soundness of legal arguments depends on the context in which the arguments are made.  Fallacies are commonly divided into "formal" and "informal". 

Cornales<====>53990<====>Cornales The Cornales are an order of flowering plants, basal among the asterids, containing about 600 species.  Plants within the Cornales usually have four-parted flowers, drupaceous fruits, and inferior gynoecia topped with disc-shaped nectaries. TaxonomyIn the classification system of Dahlgren the Cornales were in the superorder Corniflorae (also called Cornanae).   Under the APG IV system, the Cornales order includes these families:   Cornaceae (the dogwood family)Curtisiaceae (cape lancewood)Grubbiaceae (the sillyberry family)Hydrangeaceae (the hydrangea family)HydrostachyaceaeLoasaceae (the stickleaf family)Nyssaceae, (the tupelos)The oldest fossils assigned with confidence to the order are Hironoia fusiformis, described from Coniacian age Japanese coalified fruits, and Suciacarpa starrii described from American permineralized fruits of Campanian age. 

Adjoint functors<====>53991<====>Adjoint functors In mathematics, specifically category theory, adjunction is a possible relationship between two functors. Adjunction is ubiquitous in mathematics.  A pair of adjoint functors from C to D and from D to C is what is needed to make two categories C and D compatible in their objects and morphisms.   For example, one functor may embed C in its expansion D, and the other functor may collapse D back into C.   For such relationships, adjunction formalizes intuitive notions of optimization and efficiency. In the most concise symmetric definition, an adjunction between categories C and D is a pair of functors, F: \mathcal{D} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}    and    G: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{D} and a family of bijections \mathrm{hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(FY,X) \cong \mathrm{hom}_{\mathcal{D}}(Y,GX) which is natural for all variables X in C and Y in D. 

Sylow theorems<====>53993<====>Sylow theoremsIn mathematics, specifically in the field of finite group theory, the Sylow theorems are a collection of theorems named after the Norwegian mathematician Ludwig Sylow ([[# |1872]]) that give detailed information about the number of subgroups of fixed order that a given finite group contains.  The Sylow theorems form a fundamental part of finite group theory and have very important applications in the classification of finite simple groups. For a prime number p, a Sylow p-subgroup (sometimes p-Sylow subgroup) of a group G is a maximal p-subgroup of G, i. e.  a subgroup of G that is a p-group (so that the order of every group element is a power of p) that is not a proper subgroup of any other p-subgroup of G. 

Biophysics<====>54000<====>BiophysicsBiophysics is an interdisciplinary science that applies the approaches and methods of physics to study biological systems.  Biophysics covers all scales of biological organization, from molecular to organismic and populations.  Biophysical research shares significant overlap with biochemistry, physical chemistry, nanotechnology, bioengineering, computational biology, biomechanics and systems biology. The term biophysics was originally introduced by Karl Pearson in 1892.   Roland Glaser.  Biophysics: An Introduction.  Springer; 23 April 2012.   .  OverviewMolecular biophysics typically addresses biological questions similar to those in biochemistry and molecular biology, seeking to find the physical underpinnings of biomolecular phenomena. 

Comanche<====>54001<====>Comanche  The Comanche   ( ) are a Native American nation from the Great Plains whose historic territory, known as Comancheria, consisted of present-day eastern New Mexico, southeastern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, western Oklahoma, and most of northwest Texas and northern Chihuahua.  The Comanche people are federally recognized as the Comanche Nation, headquartered in Lawton, Oklahoma.  Post-contact, the Comanches were hunter-gatherers with a horse culture.  There may have been as many as 45,000 Comanches in the late 18th century.   They were the dominant tribe on the Southern Plains and often took captives from weaker tribes during warfare, selling them as slaves to the Spanish and later Mexican settlers.

Le Havre<====>54004<====>Le Havre   Le Havre ( ;   ) is an urban French commune and city in the Seine-Maritime department in the Normandy region of northwestern France.  It is situated on the right bank of the estuary of the river Seine on the Channel southwest of the Pays de Caux. Modern Le Havre remains deeply influenced by its employment and maritime traditions.  Its port is the second largest in France, after that of Marseille, for total traffic, and the largest French container port.  The name Le Havre means "the harbour" or "the port".  Its inhabitants are known as Havrais or Havraises. 

Seine<====>54006<====>Seine    The Seine (   ;  ,  ) is a   river and an important commercial waterway within the Paris Basin in the north of France.  It rises at Source-Seine,   northwest of Dijon in northeastern France in the Langres plateau, flowing through Paris and into the English Channel at Le Havre (and Honfleur on the left bank).   It is navigable by ocean-going vessels as far as Rouen,   from the sea.  Over 60 percent of its length, as far as Burgundy, is negotiable by commercial riverboats, and nearly its whole length is available for recreational boating; excursion boats offer sightseeing tours of the Rive Droite and Rive Gauche within the city of Paris. 

Shill<====>54009<====>Shill A shill, also called a plant or a stooge, is a person who publicly helps or gives credibility to a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with the person or organization.  Shills can carry out their operations in the areas of media, journalism, marketing, confidence games, or other business areas.  A shill may also act to discredit opponents or critics of the person or organization in which they have a vested interest through character assassination or other means. In most uses, shill refers to someone who purposely gives onlookers, participants or "marks" the impression of an enthusiastic customer independent of the seller, marketer or con artist, for whom they are secretly working. 

Sophus Lie<====>54010<====>Sophus Lie  Marius Sophus Lie (   ;  ; 17 December 1842 – 18 February 1899) was a Norwegian mathematician.   He largely created the theory of continuous symmetry and applied it to the study of geometry and differential equations. BiographyHis first mathematical work, Repräsentation der Imaginären der Plangeometrie, was published, in 1869, by the Academy of Sciences in Christiania and also by Crelle's Journal.  That same year he received a scholarship and traveled to Berlin, where he stayed from September to February 1870.  There, he met Felix Klein and they became close friends. 

1924 Winter Olympics<====>54012<====>1924 Winter Olympics  The 1924 Winter Olympics, officially known as the I Olympic Winter Games (French: Les Iers Jeux olympiques d'hiver), were a winter multi-sport event which was held in 1924 in Chamonix, France.  Originally called Semaine Internationale des Sports d'Hiver ("International Winter Sports Week") and held in association with the 1924 Summer Olympics, the sports competitions were held at the foot of Mont Blanc in Chamonix, and Haute-Savoie, France between January 25 and February 5, 1924.    The Games were organized by the French Olympic Committee, and were in retrospect designated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as the I Olympic Winter Games. 

Ngo Dinh Diem<====>54017<====>Ngo Dinh Diem    Ngô Đình Diệm ( ; 3 January 1901 – 2 November 1963) was a South Vietnamese politician.  A former mandarin of the Nguyễn dynasty, he was named Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam by Head of State Bảo Đại in 1954.  In October 1955, after winning a heavily rigged referendum, he deposed Bảo Đại and established the first Republic of Vietnam (RVN), with himself as president.  He was a leader of the Catholic element and was opposed by Buddhists.  In November 1963, after constant Buddhist protests and non-violent resistance, Diệm was assassinated during a CIA-backed coup d'état, along with his brother, Ngô Đình Nhu, by Nguyễn Văn Nhung, the aide of the leader of the Army of Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), General Dương Văn Minh. 

Cuscuta<====>54019<====>Cuscuta   Cuscuta ( ) (dodder) is a genus of about 100–170 species of yellow, orange, or red (rarely green) parasitic plants.  Formerly treated as the only genus in the family Cuscutaceae, it now is accepted as belonging in the morning glory family, Convolvulaceae, on the basis of the work of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group.   The genus is found throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world, with the greatest species diversity in subtropical and tropical regions; the genus becomes rare in cool temperate climates, with only four species native to northern Europe.  Folk names include: strangle tare, scaldweed, beggarweed,  lady's laces, fireweed,  wizard's net, devil's guts, devil's hair, devil's ringlet, goldthread, hailweed, hairweed, hellbine, love vine, pull-down, strangleweed, angel hair, and witch's hair. 

Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council<====>54022<====>Euro-Atlantic Partnership CouncilThe Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC), a post-Cold War NATO institution, is a multilateral forum created to improve relations between NATO and non-NATO countries in Europe and those parts of Asia on the European periphery.  States meet to cooperate and go to the range of political and security issues.  It was formed on  May 29, 1997 in the ministers meeting of Sintra, Portugal, as the successor to the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), which was created in 1991.  It works alongside the Partnership for Peace (PfP), created in 1994. MembersThere are 50 members, the 29 NATO member countries and 21 partner countries. 

Peter Bonetti<====>54023<====>Peter Bonetti    Peter Phillip Bonetti (born 27 September 1941 in Putney, London) is a former football goalkeeper for Chelsea, the St.  Louis Stars, Dundee United and England.  Bonetti was known for his safe handling, lightning reflexes and his graceful style, for which he was given the nickname, "The Cat".  He was one of several goalkeepers (Gordon West of Everton was another) who specialised in a one-armed throw which could achieve a similar distance to a drop kick. Bonetti played seven times for England, but mainly served the team as a back-up to Gordon Banks. 

Equity (law)<====>54024<====>Equity (law) In jurisdictions following the English common law system, equity refers to the body of law which was developed in the English Court of Chancery and which is now administered concurrently with the common law.  For much of its history, the English common law was principally developed and administered in the central royal courts: the Court of King's Bench, the Court of Common Pleas, and the Exchequer.  Equity was the name given to the law which was administered in the Court of Chancery.  The Judicature Reforms in the 1870s effected a procedural fusion of the two bodies of law, ending their institutional separation. 

Rubiaceae<====>54025<====>Rubiaceae The Rubiaceae are a family of flowering plants, commonly known as the coffee, madder, or bedstraw family.  It consists of terrestrial trees, shrubs, lianas, or herbs that are recognizable by simple, opposite leaves with interpetiolar stipules.  The family contains about 13,500 species in 611 genera, which makes it the fourth-largest angiosperm family.  Rubiaceae has a cosmopolitan distribution; however, the largest species diversity is concentrated in the (sub)tropics.   Economic importance includes Coffea, the source of coffee, Cinchona, the source of the antimalarial alkaloid quinine, some dye plants (e. g.  Rubia), and ornamental cultivars (e. 

Uncaria<====>54028<====>Uncaria   Uncaria is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae.  It has about 40 species.  Uncaria At: World Checklist of Rubiaceae At: Kew Gardens Website.  (see External links below).   Their distribution is pantropical, with most species native to tropical Asia, three from Africa and the Mediterranean and two from the neotropics.  David J.  Mabberley.  2008.  Mabberley's Plant-Book third edition (2008).  Cambridge University Press: UK.They are known colloquially as gambier, cat's claw or uña de gato.  The latter two names are shared with several other plants. 

Cubomania<====>54029<====>CubomaniaCubomania is a surrealist method of making collages in which a picture or image is cut into squares and the squares are then reassembled without regard for the original image, either automatically  "or at random. "   The word can also mean the collage made using this method, a "rearrangement. . .  suffic[ing] to create an entirely new work. "   The technique was invented by the Romanian surrealist Gherasim Luca.    It has been described as a "statistical method".    Robert Hirsch has seemed to imply that this process can be done with digital photography. 

Vanilla Sky<====>54030<====>Vanilla Sky  Vanilla Sky is a 2001 American science fiction psychological thriller film directed, written, and co-produced by Cameron Crowe.  It is an English-language adaptation of Alejandro Amenábar's 1997 Spanish film Open Your Eyes, which was written by Amenábar and Mateo Gil, with Penélope Cruz reprising her role from the original film.  The film has been described as "an odd mixture of science fiction, romance and reality warp".    Vanilla Sky stars Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, and Cameron Diaz with Jason Lee and Kurt Russell appearing in supporting roles.  It received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song, as well as Screen Actors Guild and Golden Globe Award nominations for Cameron Diaz's performance. 

Brocard (law)<====>54032<====>Brocard (law) A brocard is a legal principle expressed in Latin (and often derived from past legal authorities or Roman Law), which is traditionally used to express concisely a wider legal concept or rule.   The name comes from the Latinized name of Burchard (died 1025), bishop of Worms, Germany, who compiled 20 volumes of Ecclesiastical Rules. HistoryBegun in 1008, the materials took Burchard four years to compile.  He wrote it while living in a small structure on top of a hill in the forest outside Worms, after his defeat of Duke Otto and while raising his adopted child. 

List of horse breeds<====>54033<====>List of horse breeds This page is a list of horse and pony breeds, and also includes terms for types of horse that are not breeds but are commonly mistaken for breeds.   While there is no scientifically accepted definition of the term "breed",  a breed is defined generally as having distinct true-breeding characteristics over a number of generations.  Its members may be called "purebred".   In most cases, bloodlines of horse breeds are recorded with a breed registry.  The concept is somewhat flexible in horses, as open stud books are created for developing horse breeds that are not yet fully true-breeding. 

Misznay–Schardin effect<====>54034<====>Misznay–Schardin effectThe Misznay–Schardin effect (alternative spelling Misnay–Schardin), or platter effect, is a characteristic of the detonation of a broad sheet of explosive.  The explosive blast expands directly away from, perpendicular to, the surface of an explosive.  Unlike the blast from a rounded explosive charge, which expands in all directions, the blast produced by an explosive sheet expands primarily perpendicular to its plane, in both directions.  However, if one side is backed by a heavy or fixed mass, most of the blast (that is, most of the rapidly expanding gas and its kinetic energy) will be sent in the direction away from the mass. 

Jus soli<====>54035<====>Jus soli Jus soli ( ;  ), meaning "right of the soil",  commonly referred to as birthright citizenship, is the right of anyone born in the territory of a state to nationality or citizenship.  Jus soli was part of the English common law, in contrast to jus sanguinis, which derives from the Roman law that influenced the civil-law systems of continental Europe.    As an unconditional basis for citizenship, jus soli is the predominant rule in the Americas, but it is rare elsewhere.    Since the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland was enacted in 2004, no European country grants citizenship based on unconditional jus soli. 

Jus sanguinis<====>54036<====>Jus sanguinis  Jus sanguinis ( ) is a principle of nationality law by which citizenship is not determined by place of birth but by having one or both parents who are citizens of the state.  Children at birth may automatically be citizens if their parents have state citizenship or national identities of ethnic, cultural, or other origins.   Citizenship can also apply to children whose parents belong to a diaspora and were not themselves citizens of the state conferring citizenship.  This principle contrasts with jus soli (Latin: right of soil).  Modern developmentAt the end of the 19th century, the French-German debate on nationality saw the French, such as Ernest Renan, oppose the German conception, exemplified by Johann Fichte, who believed in an "objective nationality", based on blood, race or language. 

Talcott Parsons<====>54041<====>Talcott Parsons Talcott Parsons (December 13, 1902 – May 8, 1979) was an American sociologist of the classical tradition, best known for his social action theory and structural functionalism.  Parsons is considered one of the most influential figures in the development of sociology in the 20th century.   After earning a PhD in economics, he served on the faculty at Harvard University from 1927 to 1979.  In 1930, he was among the first professors in its new sociology department.  Based on empirical data, Parsons' social action theory was the first broad, systematic, and generalizable theory of social systems developed in the United States. 

Gothic architecture<====>54044<====>Gothic architecture   Gothic architecture is an architectural style that flourished in Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages.  It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture.  Originating in 12th century France and lasting into the 16th century, Gothic architecture was known during the period as   ("French work") with the term Gothic first appearing during the later part of the Renaissance.  Its characteristics include the pointed arch, the ribbed vault (which evolved from the joint vaulting of Romanesque architecture) and the flying buttress.  Gothic architecture is most familiar as the architecture of many of the great cathedrals, abbeys and churches of Europe. 

Old Italic script<====>54045<====>Old Italic script   Old Italic is one of several now extinct alphabet systems used on the Italian Peninsula in ancient times for various Indo-European languages (predominantly Italic) and non-Indo-European (e. g.  Etruscan) languages.  The alphabets derive from the Euboean Greek Cumaean alphabet, used at Ischia and Cumae in the Bay of Naples in the eighth century BC. (The Local Scripts of Archaic Greece)Various Indo-European languages belonging to the Italic branch (Faliscan and members of the Sabellian group, including Oscan, Umbrian, and South Picene, and other Indo-European branches such as Celtic, Venetic and Messapic) originally used the alphabet. 

Rubus<====>54047<====>Rubus Rubus is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, subfamily Rosoideae, with 250–700 species.  Raspberries, blackberries, and dewberries are common, widely distributed members of the genus.   Most of these plants have woody stems with prickles like roses;  spines, bristles, and gland-tipped hairs are also common in the genus.    The Rubus fruit, sometimes called a bramble fruit, is an aggregate of drupelets.  The term "cane fruit" (or "cane-fruit") applies to any Rubus species or hybrid which is commonly grown with supports such as wires or canes, including raspberries, blackberries, and hybrids such as loganberry, boysenberry, marionberry and tayberry. 

Steppe<====>54048<====>Steppe  In physical geography, a steppe ( ) is an ecoregion, in the montane grasslands and shrublands and temperate grasslands, savannas and shrublands biomes, characterized by grassland plains without trees apart from those near rivers and lakes.  In South Africa, they are referred to as veld.  The prairie of North America (especially the shortgrass and mixed prairie) is an example of a steppe, though it is not usually called such.  A steppe may be semi-desert or covered with grass or shrubs or both, depending on the season and latitude.  The term is also used to denote the climate encountered in regions too dry to support a forest but not dry enough to be a desert. 

Typographic unit<====>54050<====>Typographic unitTypographic units are the units of measurement used in typography or typesetting.  Traditional typometry units are different from familiar metric units because they were established in the early days of printing.  Though most printing is digital now, the old terms and units have persisted. Even though these units are all very small, across a line of print they add up quickly.  Confusions such as resetting text originally in type of one unit in type of another will result in words moving from one line to the next, resulting in all sorts of typesetting errors (viz.  rivers of white, widows and orphans, disrupted tables, and misplaced captions). 

Wank (mountain)<====>54053<====>Wank (mountain) The Wank ( ) is a mountain in southern Germany, situated in the Loisach valley close to the Austrian border in the southwestern Ester Mountains range near Garmisch-Partenkirchen.  It rises from about   above mean sea level up to   at the summit.  Rennenberg, H. ; Polle, A. ; Reuther, M. : "Role of Ozone in Forest Decline on Wank Mountain (Alps)", in Sandermann, H. ; Wellburn, A. ; Heath, Robert L. : Forest decline and ozone: a comparison of controlled chamber and field experiments, pp.  136-7.  Springer, 1997.The mountain is crowned by a grassy summit which has views over Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the surrounding region. 

Rolemaster<====>54056<====>Rolemaster  Rolemaster is a role-playing game published by Iron Crown Enterprises.  Rolemaster has come in four separate editions.  The third edition, first published in 1995, is also known as the Rolemaster Standard System (or RMSS for short).   Rolemaster Fantasy Roleplaying (or RMFRP) was first published in 1999 as a reorganized edition of RMSS, and is largely compatible with that edition.   The most recent publication of the Rolemaster rule set is Rolemaster Classic (RMC), a republished set of the second edition rules.  Basic game mechanicsRolemaster uses a percentile dice system and employs both classes (called "Professions" in Rolemaster) and levels to describe character capabilities and advancement. 

IS–LM model<====>54057<====>IS–LM modelThe IS–LM model, or Hicks–Hansen model, is a macroeconomic tool that shows the relationship between interest rates (ordinate) and assets market (also known as real output in goods and services market plus money market, as abscissa).  The intersection of the "investment–saving" (IS) and "liquidity preference–money supply" (LM) curves models "general equilibrium" where supposed simultaneous equilibrium occurs in both interest and assets markets.   Yet two equivalent interpretations are possible: first, the IS–LM model explains changes in national income when price level is fixed short-run; second, the IS–LM model shows why an aggregate demand curve can shift.  Hence, this tool is sometimes used not only to analyse economic fluctuations but also to suggest potential levels for appropriate stabilisation policies. 

Hypanthium<====>54058<====>Hypanthium In angiosperms, a hypanthium or floral cup    is a structure where basal portions of the calyx, the corolla, and the stamens form a cup-shaped tube.  It is sometimes called a floral tube, a term that is also used for corolla tube and calyx tube.   It often contains the nectaries of the plant.  It is present in most flowering species, although varies in structural dimensions and appearance.   This differentiation between the hypanthium in particular species is useful with identification.  Some geometric forms are obconic shapes as  in toyon, whereas some are saucer-shaped as in Mitella caulescens. 

City of Westminster<====>54060<====>City of Westminster   The City of Westminster (  or  ) is an Inner London borough which also holds city status.  It occupies much of the central area of Greater London including most of the West End.   It is to the west of and adjoining the ancient City of London, directly to the east of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and its southern boundary is the River Thames.   The London borough was created with the 1965 establishment of Greater London.   Upon creation, it inherited the city status previously held by the smaller Metropolitan Borough of Westminster from 1900, which was first awarded to Westminster in 1540. 

Amphitheatre<====>54061<====>Amphitheatre  An amphitheatre or amphitheateris an open-air venue used for entertainment, performances, and sports.  The term derives from the ancient Greek ἀμφιθέατρον (amphitheatron),  from ἀμφί (amphi), meaning "on both sides" or "around"  and θέατρον (théātron), meaning "place for viewing".   Ancient Roman amphitheatres were oval or circular in plan, with seating tiers that surrounded the central performance area, like a modern open-air stadium.  In contrast both ancient Greek and ancient Roman theatres were built in a semicircle, with tiered seating rising on one side of the performance area.  In modern usage, an "amphitheatre" may consist of theatre-style stages with spectator seating on only one side, theatres in the round, and stadia. 

Southwark<====>54062<====>Southwark    Southwark (   )  is a district of Central London and part of the London Borough of Southwark.  Situated   east of Charing Cross, it forms one of the oldest parts of London and fronts the River Thames to the north.  It historically formed an ancient borough in the county of Surrey, made up of a number of parishes, which increasingly came under the influence and jurisdiction of the City of London.  As an inner district of London, Southwark experienced rapid depopulation during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 

Inductive logic programming<====>54069<====>Inductive logic programming Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a subfield of machine learning  which uses logic programming as a uniform representation for examples, background knowledge and hypotheses.  Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesised logic program which entails all the positive and none of the negative examples. Schema: positive examples + negative examples + background knowledge ⇒ hypothesis. Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing.  Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting. 

Perpetual motion<====>54077<====>Perpetual motion Perpetual motion is motion of bodies that continues indefinitely.   A perpetual motion machine is a hypothetical machine that can do work indefinitely without an energy source.  This kind of machine is impossible, as it would violate the first or second law of thermodynamics.    These laws of thermodynamics apply even at very grand scales.  For example, the motions and rotations of celestial bodies such as planets may appear perpetual, but are actually subject to many processes that slowly dissipate their kinetic energy, such as solar wind, interstellar medium resistance, gravitational radiation and thermal radiation, so they will not keep moving forever. 

Robert Ludlum<====>54078<====>Robert Ludlum  Robert Ludlum (May 25, 1927 – March 12, 2001) was an American author of 27 thriller novels, best known as the creator of Jason Bourne from the original The Bourne Trilogy series.  The number of copies of his books in print is estimated between 290 million and 500 million.They have been published in 33 languages and 40 countries.  Ludlum also published books under the pseudonyms Jonathan Ryder and Michael Shepherd.    Life and careerEarly life and educationLudlum was born in New York City, the son of Margaret (née Wadsworth) and George Hartford Ludlum. 

Gentianales<====>54080<====>Gentianales Gentianales is an order of flowering plants, included within the asterid clade of eudicots.  It comprises more than 16,000 species in about 1,138 genera in 5 families.More than 80% of the species in this order belong to the Rubiaceae family. TaxonomyIn the classification system of Dahlgren the Gentiales were in the superorder Gentianiflorae (also called Gentiananae).  The following families are included according to the APG III system: Family Apocynaceae (424 genera)Family Gelsemiaceae (2 genera)Family Gentianaceae (87 genera)Family Loganiaceae (13 genera)Family Rubiaceae (611 genera)PhylogenyThe following phylogenetic tree is based on molecular phylogenetic studies of DNA sequences. 

Maloideae<====>54081<====>MaloideaeThe Maloideae C. Weber was the apple subfamily, a grouping used by some taxonomists within the rose family, Rosaceae.  Recent molecular phylogenetic evidence    has shown that the traditional Spiraeoideae and Amygdaloideae form part of the same clade as the traditional Maloideae, and the correct name for this group is Amygdaloideae.  Earlier circumscriptions of Maloideae are more-or-less equivalent to subtribe Malinae or to tribe Maleae.  The group includes a number of plants bearing commercially important fruits, such as apples and pears, while others are cultivated as ornamentals. In its traditional circumscription G.  K.  Schulze-Menz 1964. 

Amygdaloideae<====>54083<====>Amygdaloideae Amygdaloideae is a subfamily within the flowering plant family Rosaceae.  It was formerly considered by some authors to be separate from Rosaceae,  and the family names Prunaceae and Amygdalaceae have been used.  Reanalysis from 2007 has shown that the previous definition of subfamily Spiraeoideae was paraphyletic.   To solve this problem, a larger subfamily was defined that includes the former Amygdaloideae, Spiraeoideae, and Maloideae.  This subfamily, however, is to be called Amygdaloideae rather than Spiraeoideae under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants as updated in 2011.  As traditionally defined, the Amygdaloideae includes such commercially important crops as plum, cherry, apricot, peach, and almond. 

Rosoideae<====>54084<====>Rosoideae The rose subfamily Rosoideae consists of more than 850 species, including many shrubs, perennial herbs, and fruit plants such as strawberries and brambles. Only a few are annual herbs.The circumscription of the Rosoideae is still not wholly certain; recent genetic research    has resulted in several changes at the genus level and the removal from Rosoideae of some genera (notably Cercocarpus, Cowania, Dryas and Purshia) previously included in the subfamily.Genera Acaena – bidibidisAgrimonia – agrimoniesAlchemilla – lady's mantlesAphanes – parsley-pierts (sometimes in Alchemilla   )AremoniaArgentina – silverweeds (sometimes in Potentilla)BencomiaChamaerhodos  Bunge   – little-roseCliffortiaComarum (formerly in Potentilla)Dasiphora – woody cinquefoils (formerly in Potentilla)DendriopoteriumDrymocallis – sticky cinquefoils (formerly in Potentilla)Duchesnea - Mock strawberry (formerly in Potentilla)Fallugia FilipendulaFragaria – strawberriesGeum – avensesHagenia – African redwoodHorkelia – horkelias (sometimes in Potentilla )Horkeliella – false horkelias (sometimes in Potentilla )Ivesia – mousetails (sometimes in Potentilla)Leucosidea – oldwoodMarcetellaMargyricarpus – pearlfruitPolylepisPotaninia Potentilla – typical cinquefoils (including Duchesnea)Poteridium PoteriumPurpusiaRosa – rosesRubus – bramblesSanguisorba – burnetsSarcopoteriumSibbaldia SibbaldiantheSibbaldiopsis – three-toothed cinquefoil (formerly in Potentilla)Sieversia SpenceriaTetraglochinWaldsteinia (sometimes in Geum ) References   

Len Deighton<====>54085<====>Len Deighton  Leonard Cyril Deighton ( ; born 18 February 1929), known as Len Deighton, is a British author.  Deighton is considered one of the top three spy novelists of his time (along with Ian Fleming and John le Carré).    In addition he is a highly acclaimed military historian, cookery writer, and graphic artist.  The IPCRESS File (1962), his first novel, was an instant bestseller and broke the mould of thriller writing.  The Sunday Times called him "the poet of the spy story".   Deighton’s first protagonist – a nameless spy christened Harry Palmer in the films – was made famous worldwide in 1960s films starring Michael Caine. 

Spiraeoideae<====>54087<====>Spiraeoideae The subfamily Spiraeoideae was traditionally a subfamily of flowering plants within family Rosaceae.   The taxonomy of this subfamily has changed several times in the last century as more detailed studies have been carried out.  Spiraeoideae as defined before 2007 is paraphyletic,    leading some authors to define a broader subfamily which includes the Spiraeoideae as well as the Maleae (plants such as pears and apples whose fruits are pomes), and the Amygdaloideae (including almonds and plums, whose fruits are drupes).  Such an expanded subfamily is to be called Amygdaloideae under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. 

Harry Palmer<====>54088<====>Harry PalmerHarry Palmer is the protagonist of a number of films based on the unnamed main character from the spy novels written by Len Deighton.  Michael Caine played Harry Palmer in three of the four films based on the four published novels featuring this character.  Caine also starred as this character in two other films not directly based on Deighton's novels. Origin of the 'Harry Palmer' nameWhen developing the film The Ipcress File, based on Len Deighton's novel of the same name, the production team needed a name for the previously anonymous secret agent protagonist, they chose "Harry Palmer", because they wanted a dull, unglamorous name to distance him from Ian Fleming's James Bond, the stereotypical flamboyant, swashbuckling spy. 

List of tram and light rail transit systems<====>54089<====>List of tram and light rail transit systems  The following is a list of cities that have current tram/streetcar (including heritage trams/heritage streetcars), or light rail systems as part of their regular public transit systems.In other words, this list only includes systems which operate year-round and provide actual transit service, not ones that are primarily tourist services, are seasonal-only, or are excursion-type tram operations. Only currently operational tram and LRT systems are included in this listing – tram and LRT systems that have "suspended operation" or are presently under construction are excluded. LegendLocationPrimary city served by the tram/streetcar or light rail system. 

Pantothenic acid<====>54099<====>Pantothenic acid   Pantothenic acid, also called vitamin B 5  (a B vitamin), is a water-soluble vitamin.  Pantothenic acid is an essential nutrient.  Animals require pantothenic acid in order to synthesize coenzyme-A (CoA), as well as to synthesize and metabolize proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.  The anion is called pantothenate. Pantothenic acid is the amide between pantoic acid and β-alanine.  Its name derives from the Greek pantothen, meaning "from everywhere", and small quantities of pantothenic acid are found in nearly every food, with high amounts in fortified whole-grain cereals, egg yolks, liver and dried mushrooms. 

Vitamin E<====>54104<====>Vitamin E Vitamin E refers to a group of  compounds that include both tocopherols and tocotrienols.    Of the many different forms of vitamin E, γ-tocopherol is the most common form found in the North American diet.γ-Tocopherol can be found in corn oil, soybean oil, margarine, and dressings.    α-tocopherol, the most biologically active form of vitamin E, is the second-most common form of vitamin E in the diet.  This variant can be found most abundantly in wheat germ oil, sunflower, and safflower oils.    As a fat-soluble antioxidant, it interrupts the propagation of reactive oxygen species that spread through biological membranes or through a fat when its lipid content undergoes oxidation by reacting with more-reactive lipid radicals to form more stable products. 

Tocopherol<====>54105<====>TocopherolTocopherols  (TCP) are a class of organic chemical compounds (more precisely, various methylated phenols), many of which have vitamin E activity.  Because the vitamin activity was first identified in 1936 from a dietary fertility factor in rats, it was given the name "tocopherol" from the Greek words " " [tókos, birth], and " ", [phérein, to bear or carry] meaning in sum "to carry a pregnancy," with the ending "-ol" signifying its status as a chemical alcohol. α-Tocopherol is the main source found in supplements and in the European diet, where the main dietary sources are olive and sunflower oils,    while γ-tocopherol is the most common form in the American diet due to a higher intake of soybean and corn oil. 

Vitamin B6<====>54110<====>Vitamin B6 DISPLAYTITLE  Vitamin B 6  refers to a group of chemically similar compounds which can be interconverted in biological systems.  Vitamin B 6  is part of the vitamin B group of essential nutrients.  Its active form, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, serves as a coenzyme in some 100 enzyme reactions in amino acid, glucose, and lipid metabolism.    Forms Several forms (vitamers) of vitamin B 6  are known:  Pyridoxine (PN), the form most commonly given as vitamin B 6  supplement  Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate (P5P)Pyridoxal (PL)Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), the metabolically active form (sold as P-5-P vitamin supplement) Pyridoxamine (PM)Pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP)4-Pyridoxic acid (PA), the catabolite which is excreted in urinePyritinol, a semi-synthetic derivative of pyridoxine, where two pyridoxine moieties are bound by a disulfide bridge. 

Vitamin A<====>54114<====>Vitamin A  Vitamin A is a group of unsaturated nutritional organic compounds that includes retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, and several provitamin A carotenoids (most notably beta-carotene).   Vitamin A has multiple functions: it is important for growth and development, for the maintenance of the immune system and good vision. Vitamin A is needed by the retina of the eye in the form of retinal, which combines with protein opsin to form rhodopsin, the light-absorbing molecule    necessary for both low-light (scotopic vision) and color vision. Vitamin A also functions in a very different role as retinoic acid (an irreversibly oxidized form of retinol), which is an important hormone-like growth factor for epithelial and other cells. 

Retinol<====>54115<====>Retinol   Retinol, also known as Vitamin A 1 , is a vitamin found in food and used as a dietary supplement.   As a supplement it is used to treat and prevent vitamin A deficiency, especially that which is resulting in xerophthalmia.   In areas where deficiency is common a single large dose is recommended to those at high risk a couple of times a year.   It is also used to prevent further issues in those who have measles.It is used by mouth or injection into a muscle.   Retinol at normal doses is well tolerated. 

Fortune-telling<====>54116<====>Fortune-telling   Fortune-telling is the practice of predicting information about a person's life.  Melton, J.  Gordon.  (2008).  The Encyclopedia of Religious Phenomena.  Visible Ink Press.  pp.  115-116.The scope of fortune-telling is in principle identical with the practice of divination.  The difference is that divination is the term used for predictions considered part of a religious ritual, invoking deities or spirits, while the term fortune-telling implies a less serious or formal setting, even one of popular culture, where belief in occult workings behind the prediction is less prominent than the concept of suggestion, spiritual or practical advisory or affirmation. 

Folate<====>54117<====>Folate    Folate, forms of which are known as folic acid and vitamin B9, is one of the B vitamins.The recommended daily intake of folate in the US is 400 micrograms from foods or dietary supplements.   Folate in the form of folic acid is used to treat anemia caused by folic acid deficiency.   Folic acid is also used as a supplement by women during pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects (NTD) in the baby. Low levels in early pregnancy are believed to be the cause of more than half of babies born with neural tube defects. 

Biotin<====>54118<====>Biotin Biotin is a water-soluble B-vitamin, also called vitamin B 7  and formerly known as vitamin H or coenzyme R.    It is composed of a ureido ring fused with a tetrahydrothiophene ring.  A valeric acid substituent is attached to one of the carbon atoms of the tetrahydrothiophene ring.   Biotin is a coenzyme for carboxylase enzymes, involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, isoleucine, and valine, and in gluconeogenesis.  Biotin deficiency can be caused by inadequate dietary intake or inheritance of one or more inborn genetic disorders that affect biotin metabolism.   Subclinical deficiency can cause mild symptoms, such as hair thinning or skin rash typically on the face. 

Timeline of ancient Greece<====>54123<====>Timeline of ancient Greece This is a timeline of Ancient Greece from its emergence around 800 BC to its subjection to the Roman Empire in 146 BC. For earlier times, see Greek Dark Ages, Aegean civilizations and Mycenaean Greece.  For later times see Roman Greece, Byzantine Empire and Ottoman Greece. For modern Greece after 1820, see Timeline of modern Greek history. Archaic GreeceArchaic Period (800 BC – 480 BC). 776 Traditional date for the first historic Olympic games. 757 The First Messenian War starts.  (Date disputed by Jerome, Pausanias and Diodorus; this estimate is based on a reading of Diodorus' Spartan king lists and Pausanias' description of the war). 

Rhyolite<====>54124<====>Rhyolite  Rhyolite is an igneous, volcanic rock, of felsic (silica-rich) composition (typically > 69% SiO 2  – see the TAS classification).  It may have any texture from glassy to aphanitic to porphyritic.  The mineral assemblage is usually quartz, sanidine and plagioclase (in a ratio > 2:1 – see the QAPF diagram).  Biotite and hornblende are common accessory minerals.  It is the extrusive equivalent  to granite. GeologyRhyolite can be considered as the extrusive equivalent to the plutonic granite rock, and consequently, outcrops of rhyolite may bear a resemblance to granite.  Due to their high content of silica and low iron and magnesium contents, rhyolite melts are highly polymerized and form highly viscous lavas. 

Breccia<====>54125<====>Breccia Breccia (  or  ) is a rock composed of broken fragments of minerals or rock cemented together by a fine-grained matrix  that can be similar to or different from the composition of the fragments. The word has its origins in the Italian language, in which it means either "loose gravel" or "stone made by cemented gravel".  A breccia may have a variety of different origins, as indicated by the named types including sedimentary breccia, tectonic breccia, igneous breccia, impact breccia, and hydrothermal breccia. TypesSedimentarySedimentary breccia is a type of clastic sedimentary rock which is made of angular to subangular, randomly oriented clasts of other sedimentary rocks. 

Kart racing<====>54128<====>Kart racing  Kart racing or karting is a variant of open-wheel motorsport with small, open, four-wheeled vehicles called karts, go-karts, or gearbox/shifter karts depending on the design.  They are usually raced on scaled-down circuits.  Karting is commonly perceived as the stepping stone to the higher ranks of motorsports, for example Ginetta Juniors, FIA Formula 4, FIA Formula 3, FIA Formula 2 and FIA Formula 1. Karting is where people like Nico Rosberg, Ayrton Senna, Lewis Hamilton and Michael Schumacher started. Karts vary widely in speed and some (known as Superkarts) can reach speeds exceeding  ,    while recreational go-karts intended for the general public may be limited to lower speeds.

Methane clathrate<====>54137<====>Methane clathrateMethane clathrate (CH 4 ·5. 75H 2 O) or (4CH 4 ·23H 2 O), also called methane hydrate, hydromethane, methane ice, fire ice, natural gas hydrate, or gas hydrate, is a solid clathrate compound (more specifically, a clathrate hydrate) in which a large amount of methane is trapped within a crystal structure of water, forming a solid similar to ice.   Originally thought to occur only in the outer regions of the Solar System, where temperatures are low and water ice is common, significant deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the ocean floors of the Earth. 

Bureau of Land Management<====>54139<====>Bureau of Land Management The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is an agency within the United States Department of the Interior that administers more than   of public lands in the United States which constitutes one-eighth of the landmass of the country.President Harry S.  Truman created the BLM in 1946 by combining two existing agencies: the General Land Office and the Grazing Service.The agency manages the federal government's nearly   of subsurface mineral estate located beneath federal, state and private lands severed from their surface rights by the Homestead Act of 1862. 

Clathrate hydrate<====>54140<====>Clathrate hydrateClathrate hydrates, or gas clathrates, gas hydrates, clathrates, hydrates, etc. , are crystalline water-based solids physically resembling ice, in which small non-polar molecules (typically gases) or polar molecules with large hydrophobic moieties are trapped inside "cages" of hydrogen bonded, frozen water molecules.   In other words, clathrate hydrates are clathrate compounds in which the host molecule is water and the guest molecule is typically a gas or liquid.   Without the support of the trapped molecules, the lattice structure of hydrate clathrates would collapse into conventional ice crystal structure or liquid water.  Most low molecular weight gases, including   2 ,   2 ,   2 , CO 2 , CH 4 , H 2 S,  ,  , and  , as well as some higher hydrocarbons and freons, will form hydrates at suitable temperatures and pressures. 

Breadfruit<====>54146<====>Breadfruit   Breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis) is a species of flowering tree in the mulberry and jackfruit family (Moraceae) originating in the South Pacific and eventually spreading to the rest of Oceania.British and French navigators introduced a few Polynesian seedless varieties to Caribbean islands during the late 18th century, and today it is grown in some 90 countries throughout South and Southeast Asia, the Pacific Ocean, the Caribbean, Central America and Africa.Its name is derived from the texture of the moderately ripe fruit when cooked, similar to freshly baked bread and having a potato-like flavor. 

Bremsstrahlung<====>54147<====>BremsstrahlungBremsstrahlung ( , from   "to brake" and   "radiation"; i. e. , "braking radiation" or "deceleration radiation") is electromagnetic radiation produced by the deceleration of a charged particle when deflected by another charged particle, typically an electron by an atomic nucleus.  The moving particle loses kinetic energy, which is converted into a photon, thus satisfying the law of conservation of energy.  The term is also used to refer to the process of producing the radiation.  Bremsstrahlung has a continuous spectrum, which becomes more intense and whose peak intensity shifts toward higher frequencies as the change of the energy of the decelerated particles increases. 

Dicotyledon<====>54149<====>Dicotyledon  The dicotyledons, also known as dicots (or more rarely dicotyls ), are one of the two groups into which all the flowering plants or angiosperms were formerly divided.  The name refers to one of the typical characteristics of the group, namely that the seed has two embryonic leaves or cotyledons.  There are around 200,000 species within this group.The other group of flowering plants were called monocotyledons or monocots, typically having one cotyledon.  Historically, these two groups formed the two divisions of the flowering plants. so they can not divide in two equal parts.

Liberius is mentioned in the Greek Menology, the Eastern equivalent to the martyrologies of the Western Church and a measure of sainthood prior to the institution of the formal Western processes of canonization. LifeHe is recognized as a saint within the Eastern Orthodox Church. His first recorded act was, after a synod had been held at Rome, to write to Emperor Constantius II, then in quarters at Arles (353–354), asking that a council might be called at Aquileia with reference to the affairs of Athanasius of Alexandria, but his messenger Vincentius of Capua was compelled by the emperor at a conciliabulum held in Arles to subscribe against his will to a condemnation of the orthodox patriarch of Alexandria.

Passed ball<====>54181<====>Passed ballIn baseball, a catcher is charged with a passed ball when he fails to hold or control a legally pitched ball that, with ordinary effort, should have been maintained under his control, and, as a result of this loss of control, the batter or a runner on base advances.  A runner who advances due to a passed ball is not credited with a stolen base unless he breaks for the base before the pitcher begins his delivery. A passed ball may be scored when a base runner reaches the next base on a bobble or missed catch by the catcher, or when the batter-runner reaches first base on an uncaught strike three (see also Strikeout). 

Pudelpointer<====>54184<====>Pudelpointer  The Pudelpointer is a versatile hunting dog breed from Germany.

Pigeonhole principle<====>54217<====>Pigeonhole principleIn mathematics, the pigeonhole principle states that if   items are put into   containers, with  , then at least one container must contain more than one item. This theorem is exemplified in real life by truisms like "in any group of three gloves there must be at least two left gloves or two right gloves".  It is an example of a counting argument.  This seemingly obvious statement can be used to demonstrate possibly unexpected results; for example, that there are two people in London who have the same number of hairs on their heads.

Grand Prix motorcycle racing<====>54221<====>Grand Prix motorcycle racing  Grand Prix motorcycle racing refers to the premier class of motorcycle racing events held on road circuits.  Independent motorcycle racing events have been held since the start of the twentieth century    and large national events were often given the title Grand Prix,  The foundation of a recognised international governing body for motorcycle sport, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme in 1949 provided the opportunity to coordinate rules and regulations in order that selected events could count towards official World Championships as FIM Road Racing World Championship Grand Prix.  It is the oldest established motorsport world championship. 

Creator deity<====>54223<====>Creator deity   A creator deity or creator god (often called the Creator) is a deity or god responsible for the creation of the Earth, world, and universe.  In monotheism, the single God is often also the creator.  A number of monolatristic traditions separate a secondary creator from a primary transcendent being, identified as a primary creator.

Cocoa bean<====>54229<====>Cocoa bean The cocoa bean, also called cacao bean,  cocoa ( ), and cacao ( ), is the dried and fully fermented seed of Theobroma cacao, from which cocoa solids and, because of the seed's fat, cocoa butter can be extracted.  Pharmacognosy and Health Benefits of Cocoa Seeds, Cocoa Powder (Chocolate)  The beans are the basis of chocolate, and of such Mesoamerican foods as mole and tejate. EtymologyThe word "cocoa" comes from the Spanish word cacao, which is derived from the Nahuatl word cacahuatl. The Nahuatl word, in turn, ultimately derives from the reconstructed Proto Mije-Sokean word *kakaw~*kakawa.

Reinforced concrete<====>54232<====>Reinforced concreteReinforced concrete (RC) is a composite material in which concrete's relatively low tensile strength and ductility are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility.  The reinforcement is usually, though not necessarily, steel reinforcing bars (rebar) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets.  Reinforcing schemes are generally designed to resist tensile stresses in particular regions of the concrete that might cause unacceptable cracking and/or structural failure.  Modern reinforced concrete can contain varied reinforcing materials made of steel, polymers or alternate composite material in conjunction with rebar or not.

Singularity (mathematics)<====>54240<====>Singularity (mathematics) In mathematics, a singularity is in general a point at which a given mathematical object is not defined, or a point of an exceptional set where it fails to be well-behaved in some particular way, such as differentiability.  For example, the real function  f(x)=\frac{1}{x}  has a singularity at x = 0, where it seems to "explode" to ±∞ and is not defined.  The function g(x) = |x| (see absolute value) also has a singularity at x = 0, since it is not differentiable there. The algebraic curve defined by  \{(x,y):y^3-x^2=0\}  in the (x, y) coordinate system has a singularity (called a cusp) at (0, 0). 

Vesak<====>54242<====>Vesak  Vesākha (Pali;  ), also known as Buddha Purnima and Buddha Day, is a holiday observed traditionally by Buddhists and Hindus on different days in India, Sri Lanka, China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal, Tibet, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia and Myanmar and in other places all over the world.    Sometimes informally called "Buddha's Birthday", it commemorates the birth, enlightenment (Buddhahood), and death (Parinirvāna) of Gautama Buddha in the Theravada or southern tradition.  HistoryThe decision to agree to celebrate Wesākha as the Buddha’s birthday was formalized at the first conference of the World Fellowship of Buddhists held in Sri Lanka in 1950, although festivals at this time in the Buddhist world are a centuries-old tradition. 

Gravitational singularity<====>54244<====>Gravitational singularity A gravitational singularity or spacetime singularity is a location in spacetime where the gravitational field of a celestial body becomes infinite in a way that does not depend on the coordinate system.  The quantities used to measure gravitational field strength are the scalar invariant curvatures of spacetime, which includes a measure of the density of matter.  Since such quantities become infinite within the singularity, the laws of normal spacetime cannot exist.   Gravitational singularities are mainly considered within general relativity, where density apparently becomes infinite at the center of a black hole, and within astrophysics and cosmology as the earliest state of the universe during the Big Bang. 

Technological singularity<====>54245<====>Technological singularity  The technological singularity (also, simply, the singularity)  is the hypothesis that the invention of artificial superintelligence will abruptly trigger runaway technological growth, resulting in unfathomable changes to human civilization.According to this hypothesis, an upgradable intelligent agent (such as a computer running software-based artificial general intelligence) would enter a "runaway reaction" of self-improvement cycles, with each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an intelligence explosion and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that would, qualitatively, far surpass all human intelligence.  Stanislaw Ulam reports a discussion with John von Neumann "centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue". 

Louis XV of France<====>54247<====>Louis XV of France  Louis XV (15 February 1710 – 10 May 1774), known as Louis the Beloved,  was a monarch of the House of Bourbon who ruled as King of France from 1 September 1715 until his death in 1774.  He succeeded his great-grandfather Louis XIV at the age of five.  Until he reached maturity in 1723, his kingdom was ruled by Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, as Regent of France. Cardinal Fleury was his chief minister from 1726 until the Cardinal's death in 1743, at which time the young king took sole control of the kingdom. 

Military aircraft<====>54248<====>Military aircraftA military aircraft is any fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft that is operated by a legal or insurrectionary armed service of any type.   Military aircraft can be either combat or non-combat:Combat aircraft are designed to destroy enemy equipment using their own aircraft ordnance.   Combat aircraft are normally developed and procured only by military forces. Non-combat aircraft are not designed for combat as their primary function, but may carry weapons for self-defense.  These mainly operate in support roles, and may be developed by either military forces or civilian organizations. History In 1783, when the first practical aircraft (hot-air and hydrogen balloons) were established, they were quickly adopted for military duties. 

Myliobatiformes<====>54251<====>Myliobatiformes Myliobatiformes  is one of the four orders of batoids, cartilaginous fishes related to sharks. They were formerly included in the order Rajiformes, but more recent phylogenetic studies have shown  the myliobatiforms to be a monophyletic group, and  its more derived members evolved their highly flattened shapes independently of the skates.   ClassificationNelson's 2006 Fishes of the World arranges the Myliobatiformes as:Suborder PlatyrhinoideiFamily Platyrhinidae (thornbacks)Suborder ZanobatoideiFamily Zanobatidae (panrays)Suborder MyliobatoideiSuperfamily HexatrygonoideaFamily Hexatrygonidae (sixgill stingray)Superfamily UrolophoideaFamily Plesiobatidae (deepwater stingray)Family Urolophidae (round stingrays)Superfamily UrotrygonoideaFamily Urotrygonidae (American round stingrays)Superfamily DasyatoideaFamily Dasyatidae (whiptail stingrays)Family Potamotrygonidae (river stingrays)Family Gymnuridae (butterfly rays)Family Myliobatidae (eagle rays, manta rays)Family Mobulidae (devil rays)Family Aetobatidae (eagle rays)Family Rhinopteridae (Cownose Rays)References   

Silk Road<====>54253<====>Silk Road   The Silk Road or Silk Route was an ancient network of trade routes that were for centuries central to cultural interaction originally through regions of Eurasia connecting the East and West and stretching from the Korean peninsula  and Japan    to the Mediterranean Sea.   The Silk Road concept refers to both the terrestrial and the maritime routes connecting Asia with Africa, the Middle East and southern Europe.  The overland Steppe route stretching through the Eurasian steppe is considered the ancestor to the Silk Road(s). The term refers to many similar routes taken by traders primarily between Arabia, India and China but also to Tanzania (Zanzibar) in the south, Asia Minor and Southern Europe. 

Euphorbiales<====>54255<====>Euphorbiales  Euphorbiales is the botanical name of an order of flowering plants that is not currently recognized in the most authoritative modern treatment of plant taxonomy. In the APG II system (2003) the plants involved are placed in order Malpighiales. A well known system that did recognize the order was the Cronquist system (1981) which placed the order in subclass Rosidae and used this circumscription:order Euphorbialesfamily Buxaceaefamily Simmondsiaceaefamily Euphorbiaceae (more broadly defined than in the APG II and III systems)family PandaceaeReferences   

Desktop publishing<====>54257<====>Desktop publishing Desktop publishing (abbreviated DTP) is the creation of documents using page layout skills on a personal computer primarily for print.  Desktop publishing software can generate layouts and produce typographic quality text and images comparable to traditional typography and printing.  This technology allows individuals, businesses, and other organizations to self-publish a wide range of printed matter.  Desktop publishing is also the main reference for digital typography.  When used skillfully, desktop publishing allows the user to produce a wide variety of materials, from menus to magazines and books, without the expense of commercial printingDesktop publishing combines a personal computer and WYSIWYG page layout software to create publication documents on a computer for either large scale publishing or small scale local multifunction peripheral output and distribution. 

Hamamelidales<====>54259<====>HamamelidalesHamamelidales is an order of flowering plants formerly accepted in a number of systems of plant taxonomy, including the Cronquist system published in 1968 and 1988.

Floor and ceiling functions<====>54267<====>Floor and ceiling functions   In mathematics and computer science, the floor function is the function that takes as input a real number  x  and gives as output the greatest integer  \text{floor}(x) = \lfloor x\rfloor   that is less than or equal to  x .   Similarly, the ceiling function maps  x  to the least integer  \text{ceiling}(x) = \lceil x \rceil  that is greater than or equal to  x .  NotationThe notion of integral part or integer part of x was first introduced by Adrien-Marie Legendre under the name entier (French for "integer") in 1798, when he needed the concept for his proof of the Legendre's formula.

A repertory theatre (also called repertory, rep or stock) can be a Western theatre or opera production in which a resident company presents works from a specified repertoire, usually in alternation or rotation.  In the British system, however, it used to be that even quite small towns would support a rep and the resident company would present a different play every week, either a revival from the full range of classics or, if given the chance, a new play, once the rights had been released after a West End or Broadway run. 

Tisza<====>54275<====>Tisza   The Tisza or Tisa is one of the main rivers of Central Europe.   Once, it was called "the most Hungarian river" because it flowed entirely within the Kingdom of Hungary.   Today, it crosses several national borders. The Tisza begins near Rakhiv in Ukraine, at the confluence of the White Tisa and Black Tisa (the former springs in the Chornohora mountains; the latter in the Gorgany range).   From there, the Tisza flows west, roughly following Ukraine's borders with Romania, then Hungary, and finally Serbia.   It enters Hungary at Tiszabecs.  It traverses Hungary from north to south.

Web portal<====>54293<====>Web portal A Web portal is a specially designed website that brings information from diverse sources, like emails, online forums and search engines, together in a uniform way.  Usually, each information source gets its dedicated area on the page for displaying information (a portlet); often, the user can configure which ones to display.  Variants of portals include mashups and intranet "dashboards" for executives and managers.  The extent to which content is displayed in a "uniform way" may depend on the intended user and the intended purpose, as well as the diversity of the content.  Very often design emphasis is on a certain "metaphor" for configuring and customizing the presentation of the content (e.

Signs and symptoms classically include abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding.   Less than 50 percent of affected women have both of these symptoms.   The pain may be described as sharp, dull, or crampy.   Pain may also spread to the shoulder if bleeding into the abdomen has occurred.   Severe bleeding may result in a fast heart rate, fainting, or shock.    With very rare exceptions the fetus is unable to survive. 

Union of Utrecht<====>54311<====>Union of Utrecht   The Union of Utrecht ( ) was a treaty signed on 23 January 1579 in Utrecht, the Netherlands, unifying the northern provinces of the Netherlands, until then under the control of Habsburg Spain.   The Union of Utrecht is regarded as the foundation of the Republic of the Seven United Provinces, which was not recognized by the Spanish Empire until the Twelve Years' Truce in 1609. The treaty was signed on 23 January by Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht (but not all of Utrecht) and the province (but not the city) of Groningen.  The treaty was a reaction of the Protestant provinces to the 1579 Union of Arras (Dutch: Unie van Atrecht), in which the southern provinces declared their support for Roman Catholic Spain.

History of Denmark<====>54327<====>History of Denmark The history of Denmark as a unified kingdom began in the 8th century, but historic documents describe the geographic area and the people living there—the Danes—as early as 500 AD.  These early documents include the writings of Jordanes and Procopius.  With the Christianization of the Danes c.  960 AD, it is clear that there existed a kingship in Scandinavia, controlling the current Danish territory roughly speaking.  Queen Margrethe II can trace her lineage back to the Viking kings Gorm the Old and Harald Bluetooth from this time, thus making the Monarchy of Denmark the oldest in Europe.

He moved to Atari, Inc.  in the late 1970s.  One of his first successes was to combine an entire breadboard of components into a single chip, known as the TIA. 

Dilleniales<====>54352<====>Dilleniales The Dilleniales are an order of flowering plants, potentially containing one family, Dilleniaceae.  The APG III system of 2009, like the earlier APG II system of 2003, left the Dilleniaceae unplaced as to order, while noting that the name Dilleniales was available.Stevens at the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website has subsequently placed Dilleniaceae in the order Dilleniales.    The Cronquist system, of 1981, recognized such an order and placed it in subclass Dilleniidae.  It used the following circumscription: order Dillenialesfamily Dilleniaceaefamily PaeoniaceaeThe Takhtajan system of 1969 had the families Dilleniaceae and Crossosomataceae in the order.

Boolean ring<====>54356<====>Boolean ringIn mathematics, a Boolean ring R is a ring for which x 2  = x for all x in R,    such as the ring of integers modulo 2.   That is, R consists only of idempotent elements.   Every Boolean ring gives rise to a Boolean algebra, with ring multiplication corresponding to conjunction or meet ∧, and ring addition to exclusive disjunction or symmetric difference (not disjunction ∨, which would constitute a semiring).   Boolean rings are named after the founder of Boolean algebra, George Boole. NotationsThere are at least four different and incompatible systems of notation for Boolean rings and algebras. 

Frank Drake<====>54360<====>Frank Drake    Frank Donald Drake (born May 28, 1930) is an American astronomer and astrophysicist.  He is involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, including the founding of SETI, mounting the first observational attempts at detecting extraterrestrial communications in 1960 in Project Ozma, developing the Drake equation, and as the creator of the Arecibo Message, a digital encoding of an astronomical and biological description of the Earth and its lifeforms for transmission into the cosmos. Early life and education Born on May 28, 1930, in Chicago, Illinois, as a youth Drake loved electronics and chemistry. 

Neo-Nazism<====>54361<====>Neo-Nazism Neo-Nazism consists of post-World War II militant, social or political movements seeking to revive the ideology of Nazism.  It is a global phenomenon, with organized representation in many countries and international networks.  It borrows elements from Nazi doctrine, including ultranationalism, racism up to xenophobia, ableism, homophobia, anti-Romanyism, antisemitism, anti-communism and initiating the Fourth Reich.  Holocaust denial is a common feature, as is the incorporation of Nazi symbols and admiration of Adolf Hitler. In some European and Latin American countries, laws prohibit the expression of pro-Nazi, racist, anti-Semitic, or homophobic views.  Many Nazi-related symbols are banned in European countries (especially Germany) in an effort to curtail neo-Nazism. 

Pasigraphy<====>54364<====>PasigraphyA pasigraphy (from Greek πᾶσι pasi "to all" and γράφω grapho "to write") is a writing system where each written symbol represents a concept (rather than a word or sound or series of sounds in a spoken language). The aim (as with ordinary numerals 1, 2, 3, etc. ) is to be intelligible to persons of all languages.  The term was first applied to a system proposed in 1796, though a number of pasigraphies had been devised prior to that; Leopold Einstein reviews 60 attempts at creating an international auxiliary language, the majority of the 17th–18th century projects being pasigraphies of one kind or another, Leopold Einstein, "Al la historio de la Provoj de Lingvoj Tutmondaj de Leibniz ĝis la Nuna Tempo", 1884. 

Namadgi National Park<====>54366<====>Namadgi National Park   Namadgi National Park is a protected area in the south-west of the Australian Capital Territory, bordering Kosciuszko National Park in New South Wales.  It lies approximately   southwest of Canberra, and makes up approximately 46% of the ACT's land area.  The national park protects part of the northern end of the Australian Alps with its spectacular granite mountains.  Its habitat ranges from grassy plains over snow gum forests to alpine meadows.  The fauna is also varied: eastern grey kangaroos, wallabies, wombats, magpies, rosellas and ravens are commonly seen.  The water catchment area of the park supplies approximately 85% of Canberra's water. 

Attorney general<====>54376<====>Attorney generalIn most common law jurisdictions the attorney general (sometimes abbreviated as AG) or attorney-general (plural attorneys general (traditional) or attorney generals)    is the main legal advisor to the government, and in some jurisdictions they may also have executive responsibility for law enforcement, prosecutions or even responsibility for legal affairs generally.  In practice, the extent to which the attorney-general personally provides legal advice to the government varies between jurisdictions, and even between individual office-holders within the same jurisdiction, often depending on the level and nature of the office-holder's prior legal experience. Where the attorney-general has ministerial responsibility for legal affairs in general (as is the case, for example, with the United States Attorney General or the Attorney-General for Australia, and the respective attorneys-general of the states in each country), the ministerial portfolio is largely equivalent to a that of a Minister of Justice in some other countries. 

Sturmabteilung<====>54378<====>Sturmabteilung   The Sturmabteilung (SA;  ), literally Storm Detachment, functioned as the original paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party (NSDAP).  It played a significant role in Adolf Hitler's rise to power in the 1920s and 1930s.  Its primary purposes were providing protection for Nazi rallies and assemblies, disrupting the meetings of opposing parties, fighting against the paramilitary units of the opposing parties, especially the Red Front Fighters League (Rotfrontkämpferbund) of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), and intimidating Slavs, Romanis, trade unionists, and, especially, Jews – for instance, during the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses. The SA were also called the "Brownshirts" (Braunhemden) from the color of their uniform shirts, similar to Benito Mussolini's blackshirts. 

Houghton, Michigan<====>54379<====>Houghton, Michigan    Houghton ( ) is a city in the U. S.  state of Michigan's Upper Peninsula and largest city in the Copper Country on the Keweenaw Peninsula.  As of the 2010 census, the city population was 7,708.  It is the county seat of Houghton County. It has been listed as one of the "100 Best Small Towns in America. " Houghton is sometimes confused with, or thought to be close to, Houghton Lake; the latter is actually located in the state's Lower Peninsula.  Due to its location in the northwestern portion of the Upper Peninsula,  Houghton is isolated from the state's most populous areas. 

Pangram<====>54383<====>PangramA pangram ( , pan gramma, "every letter") or holoalphabetic sentence is a sentence using every letter of a given alphabet at least once.  Pangrams have been used to display typefaces, test equipment, and develop skills in handwriting, calligraphy, and keyboarding. The best-known English pangram is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

Awá (Brazil)<====>54384<====>Awá (Brazil) The Awá or Guajá are an indigenous people of Brazil living in the eastern Amazon rainforest.  There are approximately 350 members, and 100 of them have no contact with the outside world.  They are considered highly endangered due to conflicts with logging interests in their territory.Their language is in the Tupi–Guaraní family.  Originally living in settlements, they adopted a nomadic lifestyle about 1800 to escape incursions by Europeans.  During the 19th century, they came under increasing attack by settlers in the region, who cleared most of the forests from their land. 

Child sacrifice<====>54385<====>Child sacrifice  Child sacrifice is the ritualistic killing of children in order to please or appease a god or supernatural beings in order to achieve a desired result.  As such, it is a form of human sacrifice.  The practice has received considerable opposition throughout history, and it has often become a target for those engaged in criticism of religion. Child sacrifice is thought to be an extreme extension of the idea that, the more important the object of sacrifice, the more devout the person giving it up is.   Pre-Columbian cultures Aztec cultureArcheologists have found remains of 42 children. 

Philip II of Spain<====>54386<====>Philip II of Spain   Philip II ( ; 21 May 1527 – 13 September 1598 ), called "the Prudent" (el Prudente), was King of Spain  (1556–98), King of Portugal (1581–98, as Philip I, Filipe I),  King of Naples and Sicily (both from 1554), and jure uxoris King of England and Ireland (during his marriage to Queen Mary I from 1554–58).   He was also Duke of Milan.   From 1555, he was lord of the Seventeen Provinces of the Netherlands. Known in Spain as "Felipe el Prudente" ('"Philip the Prudent'"), his empire included territories on every continent then known to Europeans, including his namesake the Philippines. 

Disassembler<====>54390<====>Disassembler A disassembler is a computer program that translates machine language into assembly language—the inverse operation to that of an assembler.  A disassembler differs from a decompiler, which targets a high-level language rather than an assembly language.  Disassembly, the output of a disassembler, is often formatted for human-readability rather than suitability for input to an assembler, making it principally a reverse-engineering tool. Assembly language source code generally permits the use of constants and programmer comments.  These are usually removed from the assembled machine code by the assembler.  If so, a disassembler operating on the machine code would produce disassembly lacking these constants and comments; the disassembled output becomes more difficult for a human to interpret than the original annotated source code. 

Strike zone<====>54395<====>Strike zone In baseball, the strike zone is the volume of space through which a pitch must pass in order to count as a strike, if the batter does not swing.  The strike zone is defined as the volume of space above home plate and between the batter's knees and the midpoint of their torso.  Whether a pitch passed through the zone or not is decided by an umpire, who is generally positioned behind the catcher. Strikes are desirable for the pitcher and the fielding team, as three strikes result in a strikeout of that batter.  A pitch that misses the strike zone is called a ball (only if batter doesn't swing). 

Banawá<====>54397<====>Banawá  The Banawá (also Banawa, Banavá, Jafí, Kitiya, Banauá) are an indigenous group living along the Banawá River in the Amazonas State, Brazil. Their territory is between the Juruá and Purus Rivers.  Approximately 158 Banawá people live in one major village and two smaller settlements containing a single extended family each. The Banawá, who call themselves Kitiya, speak Banawá, a dialect of the Madi language.HistoryTheir territory was invaded at the end of the 19th century, during the rubber boom. In the 1990s, Brazil formally recognized their land rights. Notes  DEFAULTSORT 

Balanjar<====>54398<====>Balanjar Balanjar (Baranjar, Belenjer, Belendzher, Bülünjar) was a medieval city located in the North Caucasus region, between the cities of Derbent and Samandar, probably on the lower Sulak River.  It flourished from the seventh to the tenth centuries CE.  The legendary founder of Balanjar, according to the Arab chroniclers Ibn al-Faqih and Abu al-Fida, was named Balanjar ibn Japheth. In the 630s CE Balanjar was a capital of the Baranjar state.  Some scholars speculate that the name derives from the Turkic root "Bala" or "Great", and the clan-name "Endzhar".  With the rest of the Baranjar domains the city became part of the Khazar Khaganate around 650; until the early 720s, Balanjar served as the capital of Khazaria.

Dizzy Gillespie<====>54403<====>Dizzy Gillespie   John Birks "Dizzy" Gillespie ( ; October 21, 1917 – January 6, 1993) was an American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, composer, and singer.  Gillespie was a trumpet virtuoso and improviser, building on the virtuoso style of Roy Eldridge  but adding layers of harmonic complexity previously unheard in jazz.  His beret and horn-rimmed spectacles, his scat singing, his bent horn, pouched cheeks and his light-hearted personality were essential in popularizing bebop.  In the 1940s Gillespie, with Charlie Parker, became a major figure in the development of bebop and modern jazz.   He taught and influenced many other musicians, including trumpeters Miles Davis, Jon Faddis, Fats Navarro, Clifford Brown, Arturo Sandoval, Lee Morgan,    Chuck Mangione,    and balladeer Johnny Hartman. 

Tropaeolum<====>54404<====>Tropaeolum   Tropaeolum  ,   commonly known as nasturtium ( ;   literally "nose-twister" or "nose-tweaker"), is a genus of roughly 80 species of annual and perennial herbaceous flowering plants.  It was named by Carl Linnaeus in his book Species Plantarum,  and is the only genus in the family Tropaeolaceae.  The nasturtiums received their common name because they produce an oil similar to that of watercress (Nasturtium officinale). The genus Tropaeolum, native to South and Central America, includes several very popular garden plants, the most common being T.  majus, T.  peregrinum and T. 

Monday<====>54406<====>Monday   Monday is the day of the week between Sunday and Tuesday.   According to the international standard ISO 8601 it is the first day of the week.   The name of Monday is derived from Old English Mōnandæg and Middle English Monenday, originally a translation of Latin dies lunae "day of the Moon". Names The names of the day of the week were coined in the Roman era, in Greek and Latin, in the case of Monday asἡμέρᾱ Σελήνης, diēs Lūnae "day of the Moon". Most languages use terms either directly derived from these names, or loan-translations based on them. 

Sunday<====>54407<====>Sunday   Sunday is the day of the week after Saturday but before Monday.  Sunday is a day of rest in most Western countries, as a part of the weekend. For most observant Christians, Sunday is observed as a day of worship and rest, holding it as the Lord's Day and the day of Christ's resurrection.  In Japan,  as well as some Muslim countries and Israel,  Sunday is the first work day of the week.   According to the Hebrew calendars and traditional Christian calendars, Sunday is the first day of the week.   However, according to the International Organization for Standardization ISO 8601, Sunday is the seventh and last day of the week. 

Charlie Parker<====>54408<====>Charlie Parker   Charles Parker Jr.  (August 29, 1920 – March 12, 1955), also known as Yardbird and Bird, was an American jazz saxophonist and composer.  Parker was a highly influential jazz soloist and a leading figure in the development of bebop,  a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique and advanced harmonies.  Parker was a blazingly fast virtuoso, and he introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions.  His tone ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber. Parker acquired the nickname "Yardbird" early in his career. 

Jazz band<====>54409<====>Jazz band  A jazz band (jazz ensemble or jazz combo) is a musical ensemble that plays jazz music.   Jazz bands vary in the quantity of its members and the style of jazz that they play but it is common to find a jazz band made up of a rhythm section and a horn section. The size of a jazz band is closely related to the style of jazz they play as well as the type of venues in which they play.   Smaller jazz bands, also known as combos, are common in night clubs and other small venues and will be made up of three to seven musicians; whereas big bands are found in dance halls and other larger venues. 

Triceratops<====>54410<====>Triceratops  Triceratops is a genus of herbivorous ceratopsid dinosaur that first appeared during the late Maastrichtian stage of the late Cretaceous period, about 68 million years ago (mya) in what is now North America.  It is one of the last known non-avian dinosaur genera, and became extinct in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago.The term Triceratops, which literally means "three-horned face", is derived from the Greek τρί- (tri-) meaning "three",   (kéras) meaning "horn", and   (ops) meaning "face". Triceratops has been documented by numerous remains collected since the genus was first described in 1889, including at least one complete individual skeleton. 

Unicycle<====>54412<====>UnicycleA unicycle is a vehicle that touches the ground with only one wheel.  The most common variation has a frame with a saddle, and has a pedal-driven direct drive.  A two speed hub is commercially available for faster uncycling.  Unicycling is practiced professionally in circuses, by street performers, in festivals, and as a hobby.  Unicycles have also been used to create new sports such as unicycle hockey.  In recent years, unicycles have also been used in activities similar to mountain biking or trials. HistoryUS patents for single-wheeled 'velocipedes' were published in 1869 by Frederick Myers  and in 1881 by Battista Scuri. 

Mountain unicycling<====>54415<====>Mountain unicycling  Mountain unicycling is an adventure sport that consists of traversing rough terrain on a unicycle.  Mountain unicycling ('muni') is undertaken on similar terrain to mountain biking.  However, muni requires much more attention to the microfeatures of the short distance in front of the wheel.  The Essential Guide to Mountain and Trials Unicycling, Kris Holm, p128,    Unicycles' lack of a freewheel means that descents must be controlled all the way, and the typical lack a gear system (though two-gear hubs are available), prevents the rider from reaching high speeds.  Muni usually takes place on specially designed unicycles, which are equipped with strong hubs, large, knobbly tires, high-grip pedals and rugged frames.

The Magician (U.S. TV series)<====>54418<====>The Magician (U.S. TV series) The Magician is an American television series that ran during the 1973–1974 season. It starred Bill Bixby as stage illusionist Anthony "Tony" Blake, a playboy philanthropist who used his skills to solve difficult crimes as needed. In the series pilot, the character was named Anthony Dorian; the name was changed due to a conflict with the name of a real life stage magician.PremiseBlake was a professional stage magician who used his skills to solve crimes and help the helpless. Years earlier, Blake had been in prison on a trumped-up espionage charge in an unnamed country in South America. He discovered a way to escape with his cellmate, which began his interest in escapology. The cellmate died and left him a fortune. The escape, presumably  followed by exoneration of the false charges that had led to it, led to Blake's pursuit of a career in stage magic, which made him famous. He never forgot his unjust imprisonment, and it motivated him to seek justice for others. Initially, Blake used his Boeing 737 jetliner (named "The Spirit") as a base of operations; it was outfitted as a mobile residence ("It's like any other mobile home, only faster.") with live-in pilot Jerry Anderson (Jim Watkins). Blake drove a white Chevrolet Corvette with custom license plates ("SPIRIT") and, for its time, an exotic feature: a car phone. Blake frequently received assistance from acerbic columnist Max Pomeroy (Keene Curtis), and Max's brilliant, wheelchair-bound son Dennis (Todd Crespi). Midway through the program's run, the idea of the airplane was dropped and Blake took up residence in a posh apartment at The Magic Castle, a real club devoted to magic acts. At the same time, the supporting cast of the show was replaced with a new, single character, Dominick (Joseph Sirola), a somewhat comical sidekick. No explanation for the changes was given in the series. Jerry continued to make occasional minor appearances (and Watkins and Curtis retained places in the opening credits) and Tony recruited Jerry and Max together for one further case in the new format.Some episodes featured Larry Anderson (who later hosted Truth or Consequences and created the JawDroppers video magic course) as Blake's assistant.Magic on the programThe show is noteworthy in that Bixby, a keen amateur magician, insisted on doing all of the magic himself, without any trick photography, although it was not possible for this to be the case in the TV-movie/pilot. Many of the episodes of the regular series were preceded by an announcement that the magic tricks were accomplished without trick photography. He was instructed in these performances by the program's technical advisor, Mark Wilson, who was credited as "magic consultant."  Once the format changed to have the hero based in a magic club, Wilson could occasionally be seen on the stage there, as well. In addition to escapes, Bixby performed feats of sleight of hand, mentalism, and stage illusions. After the series' cancellation, Bixby went on to host a string of magic specials on NBC and a series, The Wonderful World of Magic, in first-run syndication.InfluenceThough it ran only a single season, The Magician was an influence on later series. The show was a favorite of The X-Files creator Chris Carter, who worked it into Special Agent Fox Mulder's "origin" story: a teenaged Mulder was waiting to watch The Magician when his sister Samantha was abducted by mysterious forces. In the Quantum Leap episode "The Great Spontini", Scott Bakula's character, Dr. Sam Beckett, leaps into an amateur magician in 1974 who aspires to appear on Bill Bixby's The Magician; however, owing to his partial amnesia, Dr. Beckett, at first, can only recall Bixby's connection with The Incredible Hulk, which had not been made at that time.The Incredible Hulk series featured an episode that paid homage to both The Magician and Bixby's earlier series, My Favorite Martian. In The Incredible Hulk's "My Favorite Magician" episode, Bixby's character became the temporary apprentice to a stage magician played by Bixby's Martian co-star, Ray Walston. Mark Wilson was on hand again as the episode's "magic consultant" as well.  In addition, Martian co-star Pamela Britton appeared in an episode of The Magician.Actor Andrew Robinson has stated that his Star Trek: Deep Space Nine character, Elim Garak, was partially influenced by Bixby's character.DVD releasesVisual Entertainment released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 on August 25, 2017.

Tangram<====>54419<====>Tangram The tangram ( ) is a dissection puzzle consisting of seven flat shapes, called tans, which are put together to form shapes.  The objective of the puzzle is to form a specific shape (given only an outline or silhouette) using all seven pieces, which may not overlap.  It is reputed to have been invented in China during the Song Dynasty,    and then carried over to Europe by trading ships in the early 19th century.  It became very popular in Europe for a time then, and then again during World War I.  It is one of the most popular dissection puzzles in the world. 

Ryōji Noyori<====>54420<====>Ryōji Noyori   is a Japanese chemist.  He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2001.  Noyori shared half of the prize with William S.  Knowles for the study of chirally catalyzed hydrogenations; the second half of the prize went to K.  Barry Sharpless for his study in chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions (Sharpless epoxidation).   Education and careerRyōji Noyori was born in Kobe, Japan.   He became fascinated with chemistry at age twelve, after hearing a presentation on nylon.   He saw the power of chemistry as being the ability to "produce high value from almost nothing". 

Sex-selective abortion<====>54421<====>Sex-selective abortion  Sex-selective abortion is the practice of terminating a pregnancy based upon the predicted sex of the infant.  The selective abortion of female fetuses is most common in areas where cultural norms value male children over female children, especially in parts of East Asia and South Asia (particularly in countries such as People's Republic of China, India and Pakistan), as well as in the Caucasus, and Western Balkans.A.

Chinese Civil War<====>54422<====>Chinese Civil War The Chinese Civil War was a war fought between the Kuomintang (KMT)-led government of the Republic of China and the Communist Party of China (CPC).  Although particular attention is paid to the four years of Chinese Communist Revolution from 1945 to 1949, the war actually started in August 1927, with the White Terror at the end of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition, and essentially ended when major hostilities between the two sides ceased in 1950.   The conflict took place in two stages: the first between 1927 and 1937, and the second from 1946 to 1950, with the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937–1945 separating them. 

Phase transition<====>54423<====>Phase transition The term phase transition (or phase change) is most commonly used to describe transitions between solid, liquid and gaseous states of matter, and, in rare cases, plasma (physics).  A phase of a thermodynamic system and the states of matter have uniform physical properties.  During a phase transition of a given medium, certain properties of the medium change, often discontinuously, as a result of the change of some external condition, such as temperature, pressure, or others.  For example, a liquid may become gas upon heating to the boiling point, resulting in an abrupt change in volume. 

Etemenanki<====>54424<====>Etemenanki Etemenanki (Sumerian  É. TEMEN. AN. KI  𒂍𒀭𒆠  "temple of the foundation of heaven and earth") is the name of a ziggurat dedicated to Marduk in the city of Babylon of the 6th century BCE Neo-Babylonian dynasty.  Originally 91 meters in height, little remains of it now except ruins. Etemenanki is considered a possible inspiration for the biblical story (or even literal candidate for the tower itself) of the Tower of Babel. ConstructionIt is unclear exactly when Etemenanki was first built.  A review article by Andrew R.  George says that its builder may have "reigned in the fourteenth, twelfth, eleventh or ninth century [BC]" but argues that  The reference to a ziqqurrat at Babylon in the Creation Epic (Enûma Eliš· VI 63: George 1992: 301-2) is more solid evidence, however, for a Middle Assyrian piece of this poem survives to prove the long-held theory that it existed already in the second millennium BC. 

Factitious disorder imposed on self<====>54426<====>Factitious disorder imposed on self   Factitious disorder imposed on self, also known as Munchausen syndrome, is a factitious disorder wherein those affected feign disease, illness, or psychological trauma to draw attention, sympathy, or reassurance to themselves.  Munchausen syndrome fits within the subclass of factitious disorder with predominantly physical signs and symptoms, but patients also have a history of recurrent hospitalization, travelling, and dramatic, extremely improbable tales of their past experiences.   The condition derives its name from Baron Munchausen. Factitious disorder imposed on self is related to factitious disorder imposed on another, which refers to the abuse of another person, typically a child, in order to seek attention or sympathy for the abuser. 

Computer algebra system<====>54427<====>Computer algebra systemA computer algebra system (CAS) is any mathematical software with the ability to manipulate mathematical expressions in a way similar to the traditional manual computations of mathematicians and scientists.  The development of the computer algebra systems in the second half of the 20th century is part of the discipline of "computer algebra" or "symbolic computation", which has spurred work in algorithms over mathematical objects such as polynomials. Computer algebra systems may be divided into two classes: specialized and general-purpose.  The specialized ones are devoted to a specific part of mathematics, such as number theory, group theory, or teaching of elementary mathematics. 

Unification (computer science)<====>54432<====>Unification (computer science)In logic and computer science, unification is an algorithmic process of solving equations between symbolic expressions. Depending on which expressions (also called terms) are allowed to occur in an equation set (also called unification problem), and which expressions are considered equal, several frameworks of unification are distinguished.  If higher-order variables, that is, variables representing functions, are allowed in an expression, the process is called higher-order unification, otherwise first-order unification.  If a solution is required to make both sides of each equation literally equal, the process is called syntactic or free unification, otherwise semantic or equational unification, or E-unification, or unification modulo theory. 

The Wonderful Wizard of Oz<====>54436<====>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz    The Wonderful Wizard of Oz ( ) is an American children's novel written by author L.  Frank Baum and illustrated by W.  W.  Denslow, originally published by the George M.  Hill Company in Chicago on May 17, 1900.  It has since been reprinted on numerous occasions, most often under the title The Wizard of Oz, which is the title of the popular 1902 Broadway musical adaptation as well as the iconic 1939 musical film adaptation.   The story chronicles the adventures of a young farm girl named Dorothy in the magical Land of Oz, after she and her pet dog Toto are swept away from their Kansas home by a cyclone. 

Metabolic syndrome<====>54439<====>Metabolic syndrome Metabolic syndrome, sometimes known by other names, is a clustering of at least three of the five following medical conditions: abdominal  obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high serum triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Metabolic syndrome is associated with the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.    In the US about a quarter of the adult population have metabolic syndrome, and the prevalence increases with age, with racial and ethnic minorities being particularly affected.  Insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and prediabetes are closely related to one another and have overlapping aspects. 

Falcon<====>54444<====>Falcon   Falcons ( ) are birds of prey in the genus Falco, which includes about 40 species.  Falcons are widely distributed on all continents of the world except Antarctica (though closely related raptors did occur there in the Eocene ). Adult falcons have thin, tapered wings, which enable them to fly at high speed and change direction rapidly.  Fledgling falcons, in their first year of flying, have longer flight feathers, which make their configuration more like that of a general-purpose bird such as a  .  This makes flying easier while learning the exceptional skills required to be effective hunters as adults. 

Bird of prey<====>54445<====>Bird of prey  Bird of prey or predatory bird, also known as raptors, refers to several species of birds that hunt and feed on rodents and other small animals.  The term raptor is derived from the Latin word  , meaning to seize or take by force.These birds are characterized by keen vision that allows them to detect their prey during flight, as well as powerful talons and beaks. Taken literally, the term bird of prey has a wide meaning that includes many birds that hunt and feed on animals and also birds that eat very small insects. 

Insulin resistance<====>54448<====>Insulin resistance  Insulin resistance (IR) is a pathological condition in which cells fail to respond normally to the hormone insulin.  The body produces insulin when glucose starts to be released into the bloodstream from the digestion of carbohydrates in the diet.  Normally this insulin response triggers glucose being taken into body cells, to be used for energy, and inhibits the body from using fat for energy.  The concentration of glucose in the blood decreases as a result, staying within the normal range even when a large amount of carbohydrates is consumed.  When the body produces insulin under conditions of insulin resistance, the cells are resistant to the insulin and are unable to use it as effectively, leading to high blood sugar. 

Muzio Clementi<====>54449<====>Muzio Clementi Muzio Filippo Vincenzo Francesco Saverio Clementi (23 January 1752 – 10 March 1832) was an Italian composer, pianist, pedagogue, conductor, music publisher, editor, and piano manufacturer. Encouraged to study music by his father, he was sponsored as a young composer by Sir Peter Beckford who took him to England to advance his studies.  Later, he toured Europe numerous times from his long-standing base in London.  It was on one of these occasions, in 1781, that he engaged in a piano competition with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Influenced by Domenico Scarlatti's harpsichord school and Haydn's classical school and by the stile galante of Johann Christian Bach and Ignazio Cirri, Clementi developed a fluent and technical legato style, which he passed on to a generation of pianists, including John Field, Johann Baptist Cramer, Ignaz Moscheles, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Friedrich Kalkbrenner, Johann Nepomuk Hummel and Carl Czerny.

Audio codec<====>54474<====>Audio codecAn audio codec is a codec (a device or computer program capable of encoding or decoding a digital data stream) that encodes or decodes audio.In software, an audio codec is a computer program implementing an algorithm that compresses and decompresses digital audio data according to a given audio file or streaming media audio coding format.    The objective of the algorithm is to represent the high-fidelity audio signal with minimum number of bits while retaining quality.  This can effectively reduce the storage space and the bandwidth required for transmission of the stored audio file. 

Video codec<====>54475<====>Video codecA video codec is an electronic circuit or software that compresses or decompresses digital video.  It converts uncompressed video to a compressed format or vice versa.  In the context of video compression, "codec" is a concatenation of "encoder" and "decoder"—a device that only compresses is typically called an encoder, and one that only decompresses is a decoder. The compressed data format usually conforms to a standard video compression specification.  The compression is typically lossy, meaning that the compressed video lacks some information present in the original video.  A consequence of this is that decompressed video has lower quality than the original, uncompressed video because there is insufficient information to accurately reconstruct the original video. 

Video file format<====>54477<====>Video file formatA video file format is a type of  file format for storing digital video data on a computer system.  Video is almost always stored in compressed form to reduce the file size. A video file normally consists of a container format (e. g.  Matroska) containing video data in a video coding format (e. g.  VP9) alongside audio data in an audio coding format (e. g.  Opus).  The container format can also contain synchronization information, subtitles, and metadata such as title.

Apron<====>54481<====>Apron An apron is a garment that is worn over other clothing and covers mainly the front of the body.  It may have several different purposes and is today perhaps most known as a functional accessory that layers over one's outfit to protect one's clothes and skin from incidental stains and marks.  However, the apron may also be worn as a purely decorative garment, for hygienic reasons and to protect from dangers such as excessive heat.  As a top layer that covers the front body, the apron is also worn as a uniform,  adornment, ceremonial garb or fashion statement.

Homemaking<====>54487<====>Homemaking  Homemaking is a mainly American term for the management of a home, otherwise known as housework, housekeeping, or household management.   It is the act of overseeing the organizational, day-to-day operations of a house or estate, and the managing of other domestic concerns.  A person in charge of the homemaking, who is not employed outside the home, is in the U. S.  and Canada often called a homemaker, a  term for a housewife or a househusband.  The term "homemaker", however, may also refer to a social worker who manages a household during the incapacity of the housewife or househusband. 

Cape Canaveral<====>54488<====>Cape Canaveral  Cape Canaveral, from the Spanish Cabo Cañaveral, is a cape in Brevard County, Florida, United States, near the center of the state's Atlantic coast.  Known as Cape Kennedy from 1963 to 1973, it lies east of Merritt Island, separated from it by the Banana River.  It was discovered by the Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de León in 1513. It is part of a region known as the Space Coast, and is the site of the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.  Since many U. S.  spacecraft have been launched from both the station and the Kennedy Space Center on adjacent Merritt Island, the two are sometimes conflated with each other.

Kuratowski's theorem<====>54493<====>Kuratowski's theorem In graph theory, Kuratowski's theorem is a mathematical forbidden graph characterization of planar graphs, named after Kazimierz Kuratowski.   It states that a finite graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K 5  (the complete graph on five vertices) or of K 3,3  (complete bipartite graph on six vertices, three of which connect to each of the other three, also known as the utility graph). Statement of the theoremA planar graph is a graph whose vertices can be represented by points in the Euclidean plane, and whose edges can be represented by simple curves in the same plane connecting the points representing their endpoints, such that no two curves intersect except at a common endpoint.

The following year, he was able to force the Athenians to capitulate, bringing the Peloponnesian War to an end; he organized the dominion of Sparta over Greece in the last decade of his life. Early lifeLittle is known of Lysander's early life.  Some ancient authors record that he rose to Spartan citizenship from helot or even slave origins.   Lysander's father was Aristocleitus, who was a member of the Spartan Heracleidae; that is, he claimed descent from Heracles but not a member of a royal family. 

Tina Arena<====>54630<====>Tina Arena   Filippina Lydia "Tina" Arena   (born 1 November 1967) is an Italian-Australian singer-songwriter, musician, musical theatre actress, and record producer.  She is one of Australia's highest selling female artists who, as of July 2014, has sold over 10 million records worldwide. Arena is an artist with the vocal range of a soprano and is multilingual: she sings live and records in English, Italian and French, as well as in Spanish.  In April 2013 she was voted Australia's all-time greatest female singer and third-greatest singer overall in an industry poll conducted by music journalist, Cameron Adams, for the Herald Sun. 

Saturday<====>54631<====>Saturday Saturday is the day of the week following Friday and preceding Sunday.  The Romans named Saturday Sāturni diēs ("Saturn's Day") no later than the 2nd century for the planet Saturn, which controlled the first hour of that day, according to Vettius Valens.    The day's name was introduced into West Germanic languages and is recorded in the Low German languages such as Middle Low German sater(s)dach, Middle Dutch saterdag (Modern Dutch zaterdag) and Old English Sætern(es)dæġ and Sæterdæġ.   The day was also referred to as "Sæternes dæġe" in an Old English translation of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People. 

Friday<====>54632<====>Friday Friday is the day after Thursday and the day before Saturday.  In countries adopting Monday-first conventions as recommended by the international standard ISO 8601, it is the fifth day of the week.  In countries that adopt a Sunday-first convention, it is the sixth day of the week.  In some other countries, for example Saudi Arabia and the Maldives, Friday is the first day of the weekend, with Saturday the second.  In Afghanistan Friday is the last day of the weekend, with Saturday as the first day of the working week.  Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates (U. 

Thursday<====>54633<====>Thursday  Thursday is the day of the week following Wednesday and before Friday.  According to the ISO 8601 international standard, it is the fourth day of the week. NameSee Names of the days of the week for more on naming conventions.  Thor's (Jupiter's) dayThe name is derived from Old English Þūnresdæg and Middle English Thuresday (with loss of -n-, first in northern dialects, from influence of Old Norse Þorsdagr) meaning "Thor's Day".  It was named after the Norse god of Thunder, Thor. Thunor, Donar (German, Donnerstag) and Thor are derived from the name of the Germanic god of thunder, Thunraz, equivalent to Jupiter in the interpretatio romana. 

Wednesday<====>54634<====>Wednesday   Wednesday is the day of the week following Tuesday and preceding Thursday.   According to international standard ISO 8601 it is the third day of the week.  In countries that use the Sunday-first convention, and in the Jewish Hebrew calendar Wednesday is defined as the fourth day of the week.  The name is derived from Old English Wōdnesdæg and Middle English Wednesdei, "day of Woden", reflecting the pre-Christian religion practiced by the Anglo-Saxons.  In other languages, such as the French mercredi or Italian mercoledì, the day's name is a calque of dies Mercurii "day of Mercury". 

Tuesday<====>54635<====>Tuesday  Tuesday is a day of the week occurring after Monday and before Wednesday.  According to international standard ISO 8601, it is the second day of the week.  According to some commonly used calendars, however, especially in the United States, it is the third day of the week.  The English name is derived from Old English Tiwesdæg and Middle English Tewesday, meaning "Tīw's Day", the day of Tiw or Týr, the god of single combat, victory and heroic glory in Norse mythology.  Tiw was equated with Mars in the interpretatio germanica, and the name of the day is a translation of Latin dies Martis. 

Young Talent Time<====>54639<====>Young Talent Time    Young Talent Time was an Australian television variety program produced by Lewis-Young Productions and screened on Network Ten.  The original series ran from 1971 until 1988 and was hosted by musician Johnny Young for its entire run.  The show was briefly revived by Network Ten in 2012 and was hosted by musician and actor Rob Mills.    The series featured a core group of young performers, in the vein of The Mickey Mouse Club, and a weekly junior talent quest.  The "Young Talent Team" performed popular classic songs along with the top hit songs of the day. 

Manowar<====>54644<====>Manowar    Manowar is an American heavy metal band from Auburn, New York.  Formed in 1980, the group is known for lyrics based on fantasy (particularly sword and sorcery) and mythology  (particularly Norse mythology and Greco-Roman mythology).  The band is also known for a loud and bombastic sound.  In an interview for MTV in February 2007, bassist Joey DeMaio lamented that "these days, there's a real lack of big, epic metal that is drenched with crushing guitars and choirs and orchestras. . .  so it's nice to be one of the few bands that's actually doing that. 

Solar flare<====>54648<====>Solar flare    A solar flare is a sudden flash of increased Sun's brightness, usually observed near its surface.  Flares are often, but not always, accompanied by a coronal mass ejection.    Solar flares fall on a very broad spectrum of emissions, an energy release of typically 10 20  joules of energy is considered to be the median for a well-observed event, while a major event can emit up to 10 25  joules The flare ejects clouds of electrons, ions, and atoms along with the electromagnetic waves through the Sun's corona into outer space. 

Chromosphere<====>54653<====>Chromosphere The chromosphere (literally, "sphere of color") is the second of the three main layers in the Sun's atmosphere and is roughly 3,000 to 5,000 kilometers deep.  The chromosphere's rosy red color is only apparent during eclipses.  The chromosphere sits just above the photosphere and below the solar transition region.  The layer of the chromosphere atop the photosphere is homogeneous.  A forest of hairy appearing spicules rise from the homogeneous layer some of which extend 10,000 km into the corona above. The density of the chromosphere is only 10 −4  times that of the photosphere, the layer beneath, and 10 −8  times that of the atmosphere of Earth at sea level. 

You Can't Do That on Television<====>54663<====>You Can't Do That on Television  You Can't Do That on Television is a Canadian television program that first aired locally in 1979 before airing internationally in 1981.  It featured pre-teen and teenaged actors in a sketch comedy format similar to that of the United States  Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In and Saturday Night Live.  Each episode had a specific theme normally relating to pop culture of the time.  The show was notable for launching the careers of many performers, including alternative rock singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, and screenwriter Bill Prady. The show was produced by and aired on Ottawa's CTV station CJOH-TV, and was marketed specifically for an American audience. 

Mixmaster anonymous remailer<====>54665<====>Mixmaster anonymous remailer Mixmaster is a Type II anonymous remailer which sends messages in fixed-size packets and reorders them, preventing anyone watching the messages go in and out of remailers from tracing them.   It is an implementation of a Chaumian Mix network HistoryMixmaster was originally written by Lance Cottrell, and was maintained by Len Sassaman.  Peter Palfrader is the current maintainer.

Anonymous remailer<====>54666<====>Anonymous remailer An anonymous remailer is a server that receives messages with embedded instructions on where to send them next, and that forwards them without revealing where they originally came from.  There are Cypherpunk anonymous remailers, Mixmaster anonymous remailers, and nym servers, among others, which differ in how they work, in the policies they adopt, and in the type of attack on anonymity of e-mail they can (or are intended to) resist.  Remailing as discussed in this article applies to e-mails intended for particular recipients, not the general public.  Anonymity in the latter case is more easily addressed by using any of several methods of anonymous publication. 

97 BC<====>54667<====>97 BC   Year 97 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Lentulus and Crassus (or, less frequently, year 657 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 97 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

He made his appearance in the first issue which was dated 4 December 1937.  He is apparently the world's strongest man, able to lift a cow with one hand.  The pillow of his (reinforced) bed is filled with building rubble and his beard is so tough he shaves with a blowtorch. 

The Bash Street Kids<====>54670<====>The Bash Street Kids    The Bash Street Kids is a comic strip in the British comic book The Beano.  The strip, created by Leo Baxendale as When the Bell Rings, first appeared in issue 604 (dated 13 February 1954).  It became The Bash Street Kids in 1956 and has become a regular feature, appearing in every issue.  Since 1961, David Sutherland has drawn about 2,100 strips. HistoryLike many long-running UK comic strips, The Bash Street Kids is frozen in the era when it began.  It portrays Class 2B of the Bash Street School in Beanotown, where the teacher and headmaster wear mortarboards and gowns and the students sit at wood desks with inkwells. 

Early infanticidal childrearing<====>54673<====>Early infanticidal childrearing  Early infanticidal childrearing is a term used in the study of psychohistory that refers to infanticide in paleolithic,   pre-historical, and historical hunter-gatherer tribes or societies.  "Early" means early in history or in the cultural development of a society, not to the age of the child.  "Infanticidal" refers to the high incidence of infants killed when compared to modern nations. The model was developed by Lloyd deMause within the framework of psychohistory as part of a seven-stage sequence of childrearing modes that describe the development attitudes towards children in human cultures  The word "early" distinguishes the term from late infanticidal childrearing, identified by deMause in the more established, agricultural cultures up to the ancient world. 

Basilica<====>54675<====>Basilica    A basilica is a type of building, usually a church, that is typically rectangular with a central nave and aisles, usually with a slightly raised platform and an apse at one or both ends.  In Europe and the Americas it is the most common architectural style for churches though this building plan has become less dominant in new buildings since the later 20th century.  Today the term basilica is often used to refer to any large, ornate church building, especially Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox, even if it does not strictly follow this style. 

Cypherpunk anonymous remailer<====>54679<====>Cypherpunk anonymous remailerA cypherpunk anonymous remailer is a Type I anonymous remailer that takes messages encrypted with PGP or GPG, or in some cases in plain text, and forwards them removing any identifying  information from the header. Sending a Cypherpunk MessageStep 1:  Retrieving the remailer's Public Key. Generally you can get a Cypherpunk remailer's public key by sending an email message with the subject "remailer-key" to the server you wish to use. Step 2:  Import remailer's public keys into PGP or GPG. Step 3:  Compose MessageCompose the message in your favorite text editor, using the following template: ::Anon-To:  Subject:    Step 4: Encrypt MessageUse PGP or GPG to encrypt the message that you just composed using the remailer's public key. 

Co-NP-complete<====>54680<====>Co-NP-complete In complexity theory, computational problems that are co-NP-complete are those that are the hardest problems in co-NP, in the sense that any problem in co-NP can be reformulated as a special case of any co-NP-complete problem with only polynomial overhead.  If P is different from co-NP, then all of the co-NP-complete problems are not solvable in polynomial time .  If there exists a way to solve a co-NP-complete problem quickly, then that algorithm can be used to solve all co-NP problems quickly. Each co-NP-complete problem is the complement of an NP-complete problem .   There are some problems in both NP and co-NP, for example all problems in P or integer factorization. 

NP-hardness<====>54681<====>NP-hardness NP-hardness (non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness), in computational complexity theory,  is the defining property of a class of problems that are, informally, "at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP".  More precisely, a problem H is NP-hard when every problem L in NP can be reduced in polynomial time to H; that is, assuming a solution for H takes 1 unit time, we can use H 's solution to solve L in polynomial time. As a consequence, finding a polynomial algorithm to solve any NP-hard problem would give polynomial algorithms for all the problems in NP, which is unlikely as many of them are considered hard. 

98 BC<====>54682<====>98 BC   Year 98 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Nepos and Didius (or, less frequently, year 656 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 98 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

P-complete<====>54683<====>P-completeIn complexity theory,  a decision problem is P-complete (complete for the complexity class P) if it is in P and every problem in P can be reduced to it by an appropriate reduction. The notion of P-complete decision problems is useful in the analysis of:which problems are difficult to parallelize effectively,which problems are difficult to solve in limited space. The specific type of reduction used varies and may affect the exact set of problems.  If we use NC reductions, that is, reductions which can operate in polylogarithmic time on a parallel computer with a polynomial number of processors, then all P-complete problems lie outside NC and so cannot be effectively parallelized, under the unproven assumption that NC ≠ P. 

96 BC<====>54684<====>96 BC   Year 96 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Ahenobarbus and Longinus (or, less frequently, year 658 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 96 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placeRoman RepublicConsuls: Gaius Cassius Longinus and Gnaeus Domitius AhenobarbusCyrene is left to the people of Roman Republic by its ruler Ptolemy Apion. GreeceSeleucus VI Epiphanes becomes king of the Seleucid Empire following the death of his father Antiochus VIII Grypus, and defeating in battle Antiochus IX Cyzicenus. 

PSPACE-complete<====>54685<====>PSPACE-completeIn computational complexity theory, a decision problem is PSPACE-complete if it can be solved using an amount of memory that is polynomial in the input length (polynomial space) and if every other problem that can be solved in polynomial space can be transformed to it in polynomial time.   The problems that are PSPACE-complete can be thought of as the hardest problems in PSPACE, because a solution to any one such problem could easily be used to solve any other problem in PSPACE. The PSPACE-complete problems are widely suspected to be outside the more famous complexity classes P and NP, but that is not known. 

NP-easy<====>54688<====>NP-easyIn complexity theory, the complexity class NP-easy is the set of function problems that are solvable in polynomial time  by a deterministic Turing machine with an oracle for some decision problem in NP. In other words, a problem X is NP-easy if and only if there exists some problem Y in NP such that X is polynomial-time Turing reducible to Y.    This means that given an oracle for Y, there exists an algorithm that solves X in polynomial time (possibly by repeatedly using that oracle). NP-easy is another name for FP NP  (see the function problem article) or for FΔ 2 P (see the polynomial hierarchy article). 

NP-equivalent<====>54690<====>NP-equivalentIn computational complexity theory, the complexity class NP-equivalent is the set of function problems that are both NP-easy and NP-hard.    NP-equivalent is the analogue of NP-complete for function problems. For example, the problem FIND-SUBSET-SUM is in NP-equivalent.   Given a set of integers, FIND-SUBSET-SUM is the problem of finding some nonempty subset of the integers that adds up to zero (or returning the empty set if there is no such subset).   This optimization problem is similar to the decision problem SUBSET-SUM.   Given a set of integers, SUBSET-SUM is the problem of finding whether there exists a subset summing to zero. 

Direct-access storage device<====>54691<====>Direct-access storage device A direct-access storage device (DASD) pronounced  ) is a secondary storage device in which "each physical record has a discrete location and a unique address. "    IBM coined the term DASD as a shorthand describing disks, magnetic drums, and data cells.  Later, optical disc drives are also classified as DASD.   The term DASD contrasts with sequential storage media such as magnetic tape, and unit record equipment such as card devices like card readers and punches.   Access methods for DASD include sequential, indexed, and direct.  Direct access contrasts with the sequential access method used in tape drives.

EXPTIME<====>54694<====>EXPTIME In computational complexity theory, the complexity class EXPTIME (sometimes called EXP or DEXPTIME) is the set of all decision problems that have exponential runtime, i. e. , that are solvable by a deterministic Turing machine in O(2 p(n) ) time, where p(n) is a polynomial function of n. In terms of DTIME,  \mathsf{EXPTIME} = \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N} } \mathsf{ DTIME } \left( 2^{ n^k } \right) .   We knowP ⊆ NP ⊆ PSPACE ⊆ EXPTIME ⊆ NEXPTIME ⊆ EXPSPACEand also, by the time hierarchy theorem and the space hierarchy theorem, thatP ⊊ EXPTIME, NP ⊊ NEXPTIME and PSPACE ⊊ EXPSPACEso at least one of the first three inclusions and at least one of the last three inclusions must be proper, but it is not known which ones are. 

RAID<====>54695<====>RAID RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks, originally Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) is a data storage virtualization technology that combines multiple physical disk drive components into one or more logical units for the purposes of data redundancy, performance improvement, or both.    Data is distributed across the drives in one of several ways, referred to as RAID levels, depending on the required level of redundancy and performance.  The different schemes, or data distribution layouts, are named by the word "RAID" followed by a number, for example RAID 0 or RAID 1.  Each schema, or RAID level, provides a different balance among the key goals: reliability, availability, performance, and capacity.

Kru languages<====>54707<====>Kru languages The Kru languages belong to the Niger–Congo language family and are spoken by the Kru people from the southeast of Liberia to the east of Ivory Coast. The term "Kru" is of unknown origin.  According to Westermann (1952) it was used by Europeans to denote a number of tribes speaking related dialects.  Marchese (1989) notes the fact that many of these peoples were recruited as "crew" by European seafarers; "the homonymy with crew is obvious, and is at least one source of the confusion among Europeans that there was a Kru/crew tribe"  Andrew Dalby noted the historical importance of the Kru languages for their position at the crossroads of African-European interaction.

Natufian culture<====>54716<====>Natufian culture    The Epipaleolithic Natufian culture (  ) existed from around 12,500 to 9,500 BC in the Levant, a region in the Eastern Mediterranean.  The culture was unusual in that it supported a sedentary or semi-sedentary population even before the introduction of agriculture.  The Natufian communities may be the ancestors of the builders of the first Neolithic settlements of the region, which may have been the earliest in the world.  Natufians founded Jericho which may be the oldest city in the world.  Some evidence suggests deliberate cultivation of cereals, specifically rye, by the Natufian culture, at Tell Abu Hureyra, the site of earliest evidence of agriculture in the world. 

De Broglie–Bohm theory<====>54717<====>De Broglie–Bohm theory   The de Broglie–Bohm theory, also known as the pilot wave theory, Bohmian mechanics, Bohm's interpretation, and the causal interpretation, is an interpretation of quantum theory.  In addition to a wavefunction on the space of all possible configurations, it also postulates an actual configuration that exists even when unobserved.  The evolution over time of the configuration (that is, the positions of all particles or the configuration of all fields) is defined by the wave function by a guiding equation.  The evolution of the wave function over time is given by Schrödinger's equation.  The theory is named after Louis de Broglie (1892–1987) and David Bohm (1917–1992). 

Scotland Yard (band)<====>54725<====>Scotland Yard (band)  Scotland Yard  is a pop rock group from Los Angeles, California: Scotland Yard began when Chris Hill began demoing songs in 1989 for a female fronted new wave pop group.  In 1991 Kim Cahill responded to an out of date ad for a singer in a local industry trade magazine.  The edgy pop rock sound from the duo would catch an ear in the Los Angeles and Orange county music scene. CareerThe addition of a live band and constant touring would break the band out of its Orange County home turf.  Numerous compilations and college radio air play helped the band build a devoted following across the USA and overseas. 

Scotland Yard (board game)<====>54727<====>Scotland Yard (board game)   Scotland Yard is a board game in which a team of players, as police, cooperate to track down a player controlling a criminal around a board representing the streets of London.

The affluent and densely populated area contains the major museum district of South Kensington, which is home to Imperial College London, the Royal College of Music and the Royal Albert Hall.   The area is also home to many of London's European embassies. 

Letter of marque<====>54737<====>Letter of marque In the Age of Sail, a letter of marque and reprisal, or, simply a letter of marque (in France, a lettre de marque or sometimes a lettre de course) was a government license that authorized a person, known as a privateer, to attack and capture enemy vessels.  Once captured, the privateer could then bring the case of that prize before their own admiralty court for condemnation and transfer of ownership to the privateer.  A letter of marque and reprisal would include permission to cross an international border to effect a reprisal (take some action against an attack or injury) and was authorized by an issuing jurisdiction to conduct reprisal operations outside its borders. 

Interpretations of quantum mechanics<====>54738<====>Interpretations of quantum mechanics An interpretation of quantum mechanics is a set of statements which attempt to explain how quantum mechanics informs our understanding of nature.  Although quantum mechanics has held up to rigorous and thorough experimental testing, many of these experiments are open to different interpretations.  There exist a number of contending schools of thought, differing over whether quantum mechanics can be understood to be deterministic, which elements of quantum mechanics can be considered "real", and other matters. This question is of special interest to philosophers of physics, as physicists continue to show a strong interest in the subject. 

Tony Award<====>54741<====>Tony Award   The Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Broadway Theatre,   more commonly known as the Tony Award, recognizes excellence in live Broadway theatre.  The awards are presented by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League  at an annual ceremony in New York City.  The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances, and an award is given for regional theatre.  Several discretionary non-competitive awards are also given, including a Special Tony Award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award.   The awards are named after Antoinette "Tony" Perry, co-founder of the American Theatre Wing. 

Inbreeding<====>54743<====>Inbreeding   Inbreeding is the production of offspring from the mating or breeding of individuals or organisms that are closely related genetically.   By analogy, the term is used in human reproduction, but more commonly refers to the genetic disorders and other consequences that may arise from incestuous sexual relationships and consanguinity. Inbreeding results in homozygosity, which can increase the chances of offspring being affected by recessive or deleterious traits.   This generally leads to a decreased biological fitness of a population   (called inbreeding depression), which is its ability to survive and reproduce.  An individual who inherits such deleterious traits is referred to as inbred. 

Incest taboo<====>54746<====>Incest taboo  An incest taboo is any cultural rule or norm that prohibits sexual relations between closely related persons.  All human cultures have norms that exclude certain close relatives from those considered suitable or permissible sexual or marriage partners, making such relationships taboo.  However, different norms exist among cultures as to which blood relations are permissible as sexual partners and which are not.  The sexual relations between related persons which are subject to the taboo are called incestuous relationships. Some cultures proscribed sexual relations between clan-members, even when no traceable biological relationship exists, while members of other clans are permissible irrespective of the existence of a biological relationship. 

Chromatic aberration<====>54749<====>Chromatic aberration In optics, chromatic aberration (abbreviated CA; also called chromatic distortion and spherochromatism) is an effect resulting from dispersion in which there is a failure of a lens to focus all colors to the same convergence point.   It occurs because lenses have different refractive indices for different wavelengths of light.  The refractive index of transparent materials decreases with increasing wavelength in degrees unique to each.    Chromatic aberration manifests itself as "fringes" of color along boundaries that separate dark and bright parts of the image, because each color in the optical spectrum cannot be focused at a single common point. 

Central Tibetan Administration<====>54751<====>Central Tibetan Administration  The Central Tibetan Administration, also known as CTA ( ,  , literally Exile Tibetan People's Organisation ) is an organisation based in India.  It was originally called Tibetan Kashag Government in 1960, then later renamed to “the Government of the Great Snow Land”.  .  The CTA is also referred to as the Tibetan Government in Exile which has never been recognized by China.   Its internal structure is government-like; it has stated that it is "not designed to take power in Tibet"; rather, it will be dissolved "as soon as freedom is restored in Tibet" in favor of a government formed by Tibetans inside Tibet.

Tibet Autonomous Region<====>54753<====>Tibet Autonomous RegionThe Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) or Xizang Autonomous Region, called Tibet or Xizang for short ( ;    ;  ,  ), is a province-level autonomous region of the People's Republic of China (PRC).  It was formally established in 1965 to replace the Tibet Area, an administrative division the PRC inherited from the Republic of China (ROC), about 5 years after the dismissal of the Kashag by the PRC following the 1959 Tibetan uprising, and about 13 years from the Tibet's incorporation into the PRC in 1951. Within China, Tibet is identified as an autonomous region.

Chinese surname<====>54761<====>Chinese surnameChinese surnames are used by Han Chinese and Sinicized ethnic groups in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam and among overseas Chinese communities.  In ancient times two types of surnames existed, namely xing ( ) or clan names, and shi ( ) or lineage names. Chinese family names are patrilineal, passed from father to children.  (In cases of adoption, the adoptee usually also takes the same surname. ) Women do not normally change their surnames upon marriage, except in places with more Western influences such as Hong Kong.  Traditionally Chinese surnames have been exogamous. 

Andrew Lloyd Webber<====>54764<====>Andrew Lloyd Webber Andrew Lloyd Webber, Baron Lloyd-Webber   (born 22 March 1948) is an English composer and impresario of musical theatre.   Several of his musicals have run for more than a decade both in the West End and on Broadway.  He has composed 13 musicals, a song cycle, a set of variations, two film scores, and a Latin Requiem Mass.  Several of his songs have been widely recorded and were hits outside of their parent musicals, notably "The Music of the Night" and "All I Ask of You" from The Phantom of the Opera, "I Don't Know How to Love Him" from Jesus Christ Superstar, "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" and "You Must Love Me" from Evita, "Any Dream Will Do" from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and "Memory" from Cats. 

War (card game)<====>54765<====>War (card game)  War is a card game typically involving two players.  It uses a standard French playing card deck.  The value of each card in decreasing order is: A K Q J T 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2.   Due to its simplicity, it is played most often by children. GameplayThe objective of the game is to win all cardsThe deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack.  In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck – this is a "battle" – and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack. 

95 BC<====>54768<====>95 BC   Year 95 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Crassus and Scaevola (or, less frequently, year 659 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 95 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

Star Trek: Phase II<====>54769<====>Star Trek: Phase II   Star Trek: Phase II, also known as Star Trek II, is an unproduced American science fiction television series created by Gene Roddenberry as a sequel to Star Trek, which had run from 1966 to 1969.  The plans for the series were first developed after the failure to create a feature film based on the earlier series during the 1970s, coupled with the proposal for Paramount Television Service as a fourth television network in the United States.  Phase II would have been the lead program for the network, being broadcast at 8pm EST on Saturday nights. 

Sima Guang<====>54770<====>Sima Guang   Sima Guang (17 November 1019 – 11 October 1086), courtesy name Junshi, was a Chinese historian, writer, and politician.  He was a high-ranking Song dynasty scholar-official and historian who authored the monumental history book Zizhi Tongjian.  Sima was a political conservative who opposed Wang Anshi's reforms. Early lifeSima Guang was named after his birthplace Guāng Prefecture, where his father Sima Chi (司馬池) served as a county magistrate in Guangshan County.  The Simas were originally from Xia County in Shǎn Prefecture, and claimed descent from Sima Fu in the 3rd century.  A famous anecdote relates how the young Sima Guang once saved a playmate who had fallen into an enormous vat full of water. 

RP (complexity)<====>54771<====>RP (complexity)In computational complexity theory, randomized polynomial time (RP) is the complexity class of problems for which a probabilistic Turing machine exists with these properties:RP algorithm (1 run)    ≥ 1/2 ≤ 1/2   0 1 RP algorithm (n runs)    ≥ 1 − 2 −n  ≤ 2 −n    0 1 co-RP algorithm (1 run)    1 0   ≤ 1/2 ≥ 1/2 It always runs in polynomial time in the input sizeIf the correct answer is NO, it always returns NOIf the correct answer is YES, then it returns YES with probability at least 1/2 (otherwise, it returns NO).In other words, the algorithm is allowed to flip a truly random coin while it is running.  The only case in which the algorithm can return YES is if the actual answer is YES; therefore if the algorithm terminates and produces YES, then the correct answer is definitely YES; however, the algorithm can terminate with NO regardless of the actual answer. That is, if the algorithm returns NO, it might be wrong.  Some authors call this class R, although this name is more commonly used for the class of recursive languages.If the correct answer is YES and the algorithm is run n times with the result of each run statistically independent of the others, then it will return YES at least once with probability at least  .  So if the algorithm is run 100 times, then the chance of it giving the wrong answer every time is lower than the chance that cosmic rays corrupted the memory of the computer running the algorithm.  In this sense, if a source of random numbers is available, most algorithms in RP are highly practical.The fraction 1/2 in the definition is arbitrary.  The set RP will contain exactly the same problems, even if the 1/2 is replaced by any constant nonzero probability less than 1; here constant means independent of the input to the algorithm.Related complexity classesThe definition of RP says that a YES answer is always right and that a NO answer might be wrong (because a question with the YES answer can be sometimes answered NO). In other words, while NO questions are always answered NO, you cannot trust the NO answer, it may be a mistaken answer to a YES question. The complexity class co-RP is similarly defined, except that NO is always right and YES might be wrong. In other words, it accepts all YES instances but can either accept or reject NO instances. The class BPP describes algorithms that can give incorrect answers on both YES and NO instances, and thus contains both RP and co-RP. The intersection of the sets RP and co-RP is called ZPP.  Just as RP may be called R, some authors use the name co-R rather than co-RP.Connection to P and NP P is a subset of RP, which is a subset of NP.  Similarly, P is a subset of co-RP which is a subset of co-NP.  It is not known whether these inclusions are strict. However, if the commonly believed conjecture P = BPP is true, then RP, co-RP, and P collapse (are all equal). Assuming in addition that P ≠ NP, this then implies that RP is strictly contained in NP. It is not known whether RP = co-RP, or whether RP is a subset of the intersection of NP and co-NP, though this would be implied by P = BPP.A natural example of a problem in co-RP currently not known to be in P is Polynomial Identity Testing, the problem of deciding whether a given multivariate arithmetic expression over the integers is the zero-polynomial. For instance,   is the zero-polynomial while  is not.An alternative characterization of RP that is sometimes easier to use is the set of problems recognizable by nondeterministic Turing machines where the machine accepts if and only if at least some constant fraction of the computation paths, independent of the input size, accept. NP on the other hand, needs only one accepting path, which could constitute an exponentially small fraction of the paths. This characterization makes the fact that RP is a subset of NP obvious.See alsoRandomized algorithmBPPZPPReferences  External linksRP at the Complexity Zoo 

ZPP (complexity)<====>54772<====>ZPP (complexity) In complexity theory, ZPP (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time) is the complexity class of problems for which a probabilistic Turing machine exists with these properties:It always returns the correct YES or NO answer. The running time is polynomial in expectation for every input. In other words, if the algorithm is allowed to flip a truly-random coin while it is running,  it will always return the correct answer and, for a problem of size n, there is some polynomial p(n) such that the average running time will be less than p(n), even though it might occasionally be much longer. 

Cherry<====>54773<====>Cherry   A cherry is the fruit of many plants of the genus Prunus, and is a fleshy drupe (stone fruit). The cherry fruits of commerce usually are obtained from cultivars of a limited number of species such as the sweet cherry (Prunus avium) and the sour cherry (Prunus cerasus).  The name 'cherry' also refers to the cherry tree, and is sometimes applied to almonds and visually similar flowering trees in the genus Prunus, as in "ornamental cherry" or "cherry blossom".  Wild cherry may refer to any of the cherry species growing outside cultivation, although Prunus avium is often referred to specifically by the name "wild cherry" in the British Isles.

Music theory<====>54783<====>Music theoryMusic theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music.  The Oxford Companion to Music describes three interrelated uses of the term "music theory": The first is what is otherwise called 'rudiments', currently taught as the elements of notation, of key signatures, of time signatures, of rhythmic notation, and so on.  [. . . ] The second is the study of writings about music from ancient times onwards.  [. . . ] The third is an area of current musicological study that seeks to define processes and general principles in music — a sphere of research that can be distinguished from analysis in that it takes as its starting-point not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built. 

Recursively enumerable language<====>54789<====>Recursively enumerable language In mathematics, logic and computer science, a formal language is called recursively enumerable (also recognizable, partially decidable, semidecidable, Turing-acceptable or Turing-recognizable) if it is a recursively enumerable subset in the set of all possible words over the alphabet of the language, i. e. , if there exists a Turing machine which will enumerate all valid strings of the language. Recursively enumerable languages are known as type-0 languages in the Chomsky hierarchy of formal languages.  All regular, context-free, context-sensitive and recursive languages are recursively enumerable. The class of all recursively enumerable languages is called RE. DefinitionsThere are three equivalent definitions of a recursively enumerable language:A recursively enumerable language is a recursively enumerable subset in the set of all possible words over the alphabet of the language. 

Termite<====>54808<====>TermiteTermites are eusocial insects that are classified at the taxonomic rank of infraorder Isoptera, or as epifamily Termitoidae within the cockroach order Blattodea.  Termites were once classified in a separate order from cockroaches, but recent phylogenetic studies indicate that they evolved from close ancestors of cockroaches during the Jurassic or Triassic.  However, the first termites possibly emerged during the Permian or even the Carboniferous.  About 3,106 species are currently described, with a few hundred more left to be described.  Although these insects are often called "white ants", they are not ants. 

Shellac<====>54813<====>Shellac  Shellac is a resin secreted by the female lac bug, on trees in the forests of India and Thailand.  It is processed and sold as dry flakes (pictured) and dissolved in ethanol to make liquid shellac, which is used as a brush-on colorant, food glaze and wood finish.  Shellac functions as a tough natural primer, sanding sealant, tannin-blocker, odour-blocker, stain, and high-gloss varnish.  Shellac was once used in electrical applications as it possesses good insulation qualities and it seals out moisture.  Phonograph and 78 rpm gramophone records were made of it until they were replaced by vinyl long-playing records from the 1950s onwards. 

Copper Island<====>54831<====>Copper Island   Copper Island is a local name given to the northern part of the Keweenaw Peninsula (projecting northeastward into Lake Superior at the western end of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, United States of America), separated from the rest of the Keweenaw Peninsula by Portage Lake and the Keweenaw Waterway.  GeographyThe area was "isolated" by dredging in 1859 and construction in the 1860s of a ship canal across an isthmus of the Keweenaw Peninsula from Portage Lake—on the east side of the Keweenaw Peninsula—to Lake Superior on the west.  The ship canal is   wide and   deep. 

Nancy Drew<====>54832<====>Nancy Drew  Nancy Drew is a fictional American character in a mystery fiction series created by publisher Edward Stratemeyer as the female counterpart to his Hardy Boys series.  The character first appeared in 1930.  The books are ghostwritten by a number of authors and published under the collective pseudonym Carolyn Keene.Over the decades, the character evolved in response to changes in US culture and tastes.  The books were extensively revised and shortened, beginning in 1959, in part to lower printing costs Rehak (2006), 243.   with arguable success.   Rehak (2006), 248. 

Mildred Benson<====>54833<====>Mildred Benson Mildred Augustine Wirt Benson (July 10, 1905 – May 28, 2002) was an American journalist and author of children's books.  She is best remembered for writing some of the earliest Nancy Drew mysteries and for creating the detective's adventurous personality.   Benson wrote under the Stratemeyer Syndicate pen name, Carolyn Keene, from 1929 to 1947 and contributed to 23 of the first 30 originally published Nancy Drew mysteries which became bestsellers.Personal lifeBenson was born Mildred Augustine in Ladora, Iowa to Lillian and Dr.  J.  L.  Augustine.Benson earned her degree in English from the University of Iowa in 1925 in just three years. 

Carolyn Keene<====>54835<====>Carolyn KeeneCarolyn Keene is the pseudonym of the authors of the Nancy Drew mystery stories and The Dana Girls mystery stories, both produced by the Stratemeyer Syndicate.  In addition, the Keene pen name is credited with the Nancy Drew spin-off, River Heights and the Nancy Drew Notebooks. Edward Stratemeyer, the founder of the Syndicate, hired writers, beginning with Mildred Wirt, later Mildred Wirt Benson, to write the manuscripts for the Nancy Drew books.The writers initially were paid $125 for each book and were required by their contract to give up all rights to the work and to maintain confidentiality. 

Maquis (World War II)<====>54836<====>Maquis (World War II)  The Maquis ( ) were rural guerrilla bands of French Resistance fighters, called maquisards, during the Occupation of France in World War II.  Initially, they were composed of men and women who had escaped into the mountains to avoid conscription into Vichy France's  Service du travail obligatoire (English: Compulsory Work Service; STO) to provide forced labor for Germany.  To avert capture and deportation to Germany, they became increasingly organized into active resistance groups. MeaningOriginally the word came from the kind of terrain in which the armed resistance groups hid, the type of high ground in southeastern France covered with scrub growth. 

Stratemeyer Syndicate<====>54837<====>Stratemeyer SyndicateThe Stratemeyer Syndicate was the producer of a number of mystery series for children, including Nancy Drew, the Hardy Boys, the various Tom Swift series, the Bobbsey Twins, the Rover Boys, and others. HistoryCreated by Edward Stratemeyer, the Stratemeyer Syndicate was the first book packager to have its books aimed at children, rather than adults.  The Syndicate was wildly successful; at one time it was believed that the overwhelming majority  of the books children read in the United States were Stratemeyer Syndicate books, based on a 1922 study of over 36,000 children country-wide.  Stratemeyer's business acumen was in realizing that there was a huge, untapped market for children's books. 

Biogas<====>54838<====>Biogas  Biogas typically refers to a mixture of different gases produced by the breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen.  Biogas can be produced from raw materials such as agricultural waste, manure, municipal waste, plant material, sewage, green waste or food waste.  Biogas is a renewable energy source. Biogas can be produced by anaerobic digestion with anaerobic organisms, which digest material inside a closed system, or fermentation of biodegradable materials.  Biogas is primarily methane ( ) and carbon dioxide ( ) and may have small amounts of hydrogen sulfide ( ), moisture and siloxanes. 

Eutrophication<====>54840<====>EutrophicationEutrophication (Greek: eutrophia (from eu "well" + trephein "nourish". );  ), or more precisely hypertrophication, is the enrichment of a water body with nutrients, usually with an excess amount of nutrients.  This process induces growth of plants and algae and due to the biomass load, may result in oxygen depletion of the water body.   One example is the "bloom" or great increase of phytoplankton in a water body as a response to increased levels of nutrients.  Eutrophication is almost always induced by the discharge of phosphate-containing detergents, fertilizers, or sewage, into an aquatic system. Mechanism of eutrophicationEutrophication arises from the oversupply of nutrients, which leads to overgrowth of plants and algae. 

Robbery<====>54849<====>Robbery   Robbery is the crime of taking or attempting to take anything of value by force, threat of force, or by putting the victim in fear.  According to common law, robbery is defined as taking the property of another, with the intent to permanently deprive the person of that property, by means of force or fear; that is, it is a larceny or theft accomplished by an assault.   Precise definitions of the offence may vary between jurisdictions.  Robbery is differentiated from other forms of theft (such as burglary, shoplifting, or car theft) by its inherently violent nature (a violent crime); whereas many lesser forms of theft are punished as misdemeanors, robbery is always a felony in jurisdictions that distinguish between the two. 

Savoy Ballroom<====>54860<====>Savoy Ballroom The Savoy Ballroom was a large ballroom for music and public dancing located at 596 Lenox Avenue, between 140th and 141st Streets in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.  Lenox Avenue was the main thoroughfare through upper Harlem.  Poet Langston Hughes calls it the Heartbeat of Harlem in Juke Box Love Song, and he set his work "Lenox Avenue: Midnight" on the legendary street.  The Savoy was one of many Harlem hot spots along Lenox, but it was the one to be called the "World's Finest Ballroom".It was in operation from March 12, 1926,    to July 10, 1958,    and as Barbara Englebrecht writes in her article "Swinging at the Savoy", it was "a building, a geographic place, a ballroom, and the 'soul' of a neighborhood". 

Harlem<====>54861<====>Harlem    Harlem is a large neighborhood in the northern section of the New York City borough of Manhattan.  Since the 1920s, Harlem has been known as a major African American residential, cultural and business center.  Originally a Dutch village, formally organized in 1658,  it is named after the city of Haarlem in the Netherlands.  Harlem's history has been defined by a series of economic boom-and-bust cycles, with significant population shifts accompanying each cycle.  Following the Civil War, poor Jews and poor Italians were the predominant demographic in Harlem.  African-American residents began to arrive in large numbers in 1905 as part of the Great Migration. 

Downing Street<====>54862<====>Downing Street   Downing Street is a street in London, United Kingdom, known for housing the official residences and offices of the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.   "Downing Street" is used as a metonym for the Government of the United Kingdom. Downing Street is off Whitehall in central London, a few minutes' walk from the Houses of Parliament and a little further from Buckingham Palace.   The street was built in the 1680s by Sir George Downing.  The houses on the south side of the street were demolished in the 19th century to make way for government offices now occupied by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

Magnus III of Sweden<====>54885<====>Magnus III of Sweden  Magnus III ( ; 1240 – 18 December 1290) was King of Sweden from 1275 until his death in 1290. NameHe was the "first Magnus" to rule Sweden for any length of time, not generally regarded as a usurper or a pretender (but third Magnus to have been proclaimed Sweden's king and ruled there).  Later historians ascribe his epithet "Ladulås" – Barnlock – to a decree of 1279 or 1280 freeing the yeomanry from the duty to provide sustenance for travelling nobles and bishops ("Peasants! Lock your barns!"); another theory is that it's a corruption of Ladislaus, which could possibly have been his second name, considering his Slavic heritage. 

Basil Zaharoff<====>54886<====>Basil Zaharoff  Basil Zaharoff, GCB, GBE ( ; October 6, 1849 – November 27, 1936), usually known by his honorific title Sir Basil Zaharoff, was a Greek arms dealer and industrialist.  One of the richest men in the world during his lifetime, Zaharoff was variously described including “merchant of death” and “mystery man of Europe”.    His success was forged through his cunning, often aggressive and sharp business tactics.  These included the sale of arms to opposing sides in conflicts, sometimes delivering fake or faulty machinery, and reportedly sabotaging trade demonstrations. Early lifeBasileios Zacharias was the only son and eldest of four children of a Greek merchant, born in the Ottoman Empire town of Muğla. 

Svend Robinson<====>54887<====>Svend Robinson Svend Robinson (born March 4, 1952) is a Canadian former politician.

When he chose not to run again in the June 2004 election, he was one of the longest-serving members in the House of Commons, having been elected and re-elected for seven consecutive terms. He is noted as the first member of Parliament in Canadian history to come out as gay while in office.  "Trailblazer Svend Robinson congratulates Kathleen Wynne, Canada's first openly gay premier". 

Telomere<====>54888<====>Telomere A telomere is a region of repetitive nucleotide sequences at each end of a chromosome, which protects the end of the chromosome from deterioration or from fusion with neighboring chromosomes.  Its name is derived from the Greek nouns telos (τέλος) "end" and merοs (μέρος, root: μερ-) "part".  For vertebrates, the sequence of nucleotides in telomeres is TTAGGG, with the complementary DNA strand being AATCCC, with a single-stranded TTAGGG overhang.   This sequence of TTAGGG is repeated approximately 2,500 times in humans.   In humans, average telomere length declines from about 11 kilobases at birthto less than 4 kilobases in old age,    with the average rate of decline being greater in men than in women. 

Tonkatsu<====>54889<====>Tonkatsu   , is a Japanese dish which consists of a breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet.  There are two main types, fillet and loin.  It is often served with shredded cabbage.  In Korea, tonkatsu is known as don-gaseu ( ) or don-kkaseu ( ), which derived from a transliteration of the Japanese word. EtymologyThe word tonkatsu is a combination of the Sino-Japanese word ton ( ) meaning "pig" and katsu ( ), which is a shortened form of katsuretsu ( ), the transliteration of the English word cutlet, which again derived from french côtelette, meaning "meat chop".

Chlorofluorocarbon<====>54910<====>ChlorofluorocarbonChlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are fully halogenated paraffin hydrocarbons that contain only carbon, chlorine, and fluorine, produced as volatile derivative of methane, ethane, and propane.  They are also commonly known by the DuPont brand name Freon.  The most common representative is dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12 or Freon-12).  Many CFCs have been widely used as refrigerants, propellants (in aerosol applications), and solvents.  Because CFCs contribute to ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere, the manufacture of such compounds has been phased out under the Montreal Protocol, and they are being replaced with other products such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)  (e. g. , R-410A) and R-134a. 

Dew<====>54911<====>Dew   Dew is water in the form of droplets that appears on thin, exposed objects in the morning or evening due to condensation.   As the exposed surface cools by radiating its heat, atmospheric moisture condenses at a rate greater than that at which it can evaporate, resulting in the formation of water droplets.  When temperatures are low enough, dew takes the form of ice; this form is called frost. Because dew is related to the temperature of surfaces, in late summer it forms most easily on surfaces that are not warmed by conducted heat from deep ground, such as grass, leaves, railings, car roofs, and bridges. 

Dew point<====>54912<====>Dew point  The dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapor.  When further cooled, the airborne water vapor will condense to form liquid water (dew).  When air cools to its dew point through contact with a surface that is colder than the air, water will condense on the surface. When the temperature is below the freezing point of water, the dew point is called the frost point, as frost is formed rather than dew.   The measurement of the dew point is related to humidity. 

Cockfight<====>54920<====>Cockfight A cockfight is a blood sport between two cocks, or gamecocks, held in a ring called a cockpit.  The history of raising fowl for fighting goes back 6,000 years.  The first documented use of the word gamecock, denoting use of the cock as to a "game", a sport, pastime or entertainment, was recorded in 1634,  after the term "cock of the game" used by George Wilson, in the earliest known book on the sport of cockfighting in The Commendation of Cocks and Cock Fighting in 1607.  But it was during Magellan's voyage of discovery of the Philippines in 1521 when modern cockfighting was first witnessed and documented by Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's chronicler, in the kingdom of Taytay.

Cardonald<====>54925<====>Cardonald    Cardonald ( ,    List of railway station names in English, Scots and Gaelic – NewsNetScotland   ) is an outlying suburb of the Scottish city of Glasgow.  Formerly a village in its own right, it lies to the southwest of the city and is bounded to the south by the White Cart Water.  The area was part of Renfrewshire until 1926 when the villages of Cardonald, Crookston, Halfway and their surrounding farmland were annexed to Glasgow. HistoryIn the 15th century the lands of Cardonald in Renfrewshire were the property of Johannes Norwald or Normanville, Dominus of Cardownalde. 

Ginger<====>54929<====>Ginger    Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is a flowering plant whose rhizome, ginger root or simply ginger, is widely used as a spice or a folk medicine.  It is a herbaceous perennial which grows annual pseudostems (false stems made of the rolled bases of leaves) about a meter tall bearing narrow leaf blades.  The inflorescences bear pale yellow with purple flowers and arise directly from the rhizome on separate shoots .  Ginger is in the family Zingiberaceae, to which also belong turmeric (Curcuma longa), cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum), and galangal.  Ginger originated in the tropical rainforests from the Indian subcontinent to Southern Asia where ginger plants show considerable genetic variation. 

Fumarole<====>54930<====>Fumarole  A fumarole (or fumerole - the word ultimately comes from the  Latin fumus, "smoke") is an opening in a planet's crust, often in areas surrounding volcanoes, which emits steam and gases such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen sulfide.  The steam forms when superheated water condenses as its pressure drops when it emerges from the ground.  The name solfatara, from the Italian solfo, "sulfur" (via the Sicilian language - compare to the volcano Solfatara), is given to fumaroles that emit sulfurous gases. Fumaroles may occur along tiny cracks or long fissures, in chaotic clusters or fields, and on the surfaces of lava flows and of thick deposits of pyroclastic flows. 

Cigars of the Pharaoh<====>54931<====>Cigars of the Pharaoh    Cigars of the Pharaoh ( ) is the fourth volume of The Adventures of Tintin, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé.  Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper   for its children's supplement  , it was serialised weekly from December 1932 to February 1934 before being published in a collected volume by Casterman in 1934.  The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, who are travelling in Egypt when they discover a pharaoh's tomb filled with dead Egyptologists and boxes of cigars.  Pursuing the mystery of these cigars, they travel across Arabia and India, and reveal the secrets of an international drug smuggling enterprise. 

King Ottokar's Sceptre<====>54932<====>King Ottokar's Sceptre    King Ottokar's Sceptre ( ) is the eighth volume of The Adventures of Tintin, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé.  Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper   for its children's supplement  , it was serialised weekly from August 1938 to August 1939.  Hergé intended the story as a satirical criticism of the expansionist policies of Nazi Germany, in particular the annexation of Austria in March 1938 (the Anschluss).  The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, who travel to the fictional Balkan nation of Syldavia, where they combat a plot to overthrow the monarchy of King Muskar XII. 

The Red Sea Sharks<====>54933<====>The Red Sea Sharks   The Red Sea Sharks ( ) is the nineteenth volume of The Adventures of Tintin, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé.  The story was initially serialised weekly in Belgium's Tintin magazine from October 1956 to January 1958 before being published in a collected volume by Casterman in 1958.  The narrative follows the young reporter Tintin, his dog Snowy, and his friend Captain Haddock as they travel to the (fictional) Middle Eastern kingdom of Khemed with the intention of aiding the Emir Ben Kalish Ezab in regaining control after a coup d'état by his enemies, who are financed by slave traders. 

Saint Nicholas<====>54938<====>Saint NicholasSaint Nicholas ( ,  ,  ; 15 March 270 – 6 December 343),also called Nikolaos of Myra or Nicholas of Bari, was Bishop of Myra, in Asia Minor (modern-day Demre, Turkey),  and is a historic Christian saint.  Because of the many miracles attributed to his intercession, he is also known as Nikolaos the Wonderworker ( ,  ).  Saint Nicholas is the patron saint of sailors, merchants, archers, repentant thieves, children, brewers, pawnbrokers and students in various cities and countries around Europe.  His reputation evolved among the faithful, as was common for early Christian saints,  and his legendary habit of secret gift-giving gave rise to the traditional model of Santa Claus (“Saint Nick”) through Sinterklaas. 

Goldwasser<====>54941<====>Goldwasser  Danziger Goldwasser ( , "vodka of Gdańsk"), with Goldwasser as the registered tradename, is a strong (35% ABV) root and herbal liqueur which has been produced since at least 1598 in Danzig (Gdańsk). The most prominent characteristic of this alcoholic beverage is small flakes of 22 or 23 karat gold suspended in it.  Alcoholic solutions were used by artists for Gilding, which is believed to be the inspiration for the drink.  Alchemy, which was at its high point in the late 16th century when Goldwasser appeared, held gold to have many desirable medical properties; while modern medicine disputes this, native gold is known to be non-toxic to humans and to pass through the digestive tract unchanged, unlike most other heavy metals. 

Cultural relativism<====>54943<====>Cultural relativism Cultural relativism is the idea that a person's beliefs, values, and practices should be understood based on that person's own culture, rather than be judged against the criteria of another. It was established as axiomatic in anthropological research by Franz Boas in the first few decades of the 20th century and later popularized by his students.   Boas first articulated the idea in 1887: "civilization is not something absolute, but . . .  is relative, and . . .  our ideas and conceptions are true only so far as our civilization goes".   However, Boas did not coin the term. 

Religious intolerance<====>54944<====>Religious intolerance    Religious intolerance is intolerance against another's religious beliefs or practices or lack thereof. DefinitionThe mere statement on the part of a religion that its own beliefs and practices are correct and any contrary beliefs are incorrect does not in itself constitute intolerance (i. e. , ideological intolerance). Religious intolerance, rather, is when a group (e. g. , a society, religious group, non-religious group) specifically refuses to tolerate practices, persons or beliefs  on religious grounds. Historical perspectivesThe modern concept of intolerance developed out of the religious controversies between Protestants and Catholics in 17th- and 18th-century England.

Yaoi<====>54946<====>Yaoi ( ;  ,  ), primarily known as   in Japan, is a Japanese genre of fictional media focusing on romantic or sexual relationships between male characters, typically marketed for a female audience and usually created by female authors.  Yaoi also attracts male readers, but manga specifically marketed for a gay male audience (bara) is considered a separate genre. The main characters in yaoi usually conform to the formula of the seme (the "top", or dominant figure) who pursues the uke (the "bottom", or passive figure).  Material classified as yaoi typically depicts gay relationships between male characters and may include homoerotic content. 

Lecythidales<====>54948<====>Lecythidales Lecythidales is a botanical name at the rank of order.  The name was used by the Cronquist system for an order placed in subclass Dilleniidae.

Il Capitano<====>54950<====>Il Capitano  Il Capitano("The Captain") is one of the four stock characters of commedia dell'arte.   He most-likely was never a "Captain", but rather appropriated the name for himself.He is often a braggart and a swaggerer    who can maintain his claims only by benefit of the fact that none of the locals know him.  He is usually a Spaniard  given the fact that for most of the late Renaissance to well into 17th century, parts of Italy were under Spanish domination.  He was most likely inspired by the boisterous Iberic caudillos who told tall tales of their exploits either in the conquest of the Americas or in the wars with Germany. 

Technical drawing<====>54952<====>Technical drawing Technical drawing, drafting or drawing, is the act and discipline of composing drawings that visually communicate how something functions or is constructed. Technical drawing is essential for communicating ideas in industry and engineering. To make the drawings easier to understand, people use familiar symbols, perspectives, units of measurement, notation systems, visual styles, and page layout.  Together, such conventions constitute a visual language and help to ensure that the drawing is unambiguous and relatively easy to understand.  Many of the symbols and principles of technical drawing are codified in an international standard called ISO 128. The need for precise communication in the preparation of a functional document distinguishes technical drawing from the expressive drawing of the visual arts. 

Olybrius<====>54953<====>Olybrius  Olybrius ( )  (died October 22 or November 2, 472) was Western Roman Emperor from April or May 472 until his death; his rule was not recognised as legitimate by the Eastern Roman Empire.  He was in reality a puppet ruler put on the throne by the Roman general of Germanic descent Ricimer, and was mainly interested in religion; while the actual power was held by Ricimer and his nephew Gundobad. BiographyFamily and early careerOlybrius was born in Rome, in the ancient and powerful gens Anicia,  of Italian descent. According to the consensus of historians, he was related to the Consul Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius, whose wife and cousin, Anicia Juliana, had the same name that Olybrius gave to his own daughter. 

Radio drama<====>54954<====>Radio dramaRadio drama (or audio drama, audio play, radio play,  radio theater, or audio theater) is a dramatized, purely acoustic performance, broadcast on radio.  With no visual component, radio drama depends on dialogue, music and sound effects to help the listener imagine the characters and story: "It is auditory in the physical dimension but equally powerful as a visual force in the psychological dimension. " Radio drama achieved widespread popularity within a decade of its initial development in the 1920s.  By the 1940s, it was a leading international popular entertainment.  With the advent of television in the 1950s, however, radio drama lost some of its popularity, and in some countries has never regained large audiences.

Younger Dryas<====>54957<====>Younger Dryas The Younger Dryas is a climatic event from c.  12,900 to c.  11,700 years ago (BP).  It is named after an indicator genus, the alpine-tundra wildflower Dryas octopetala, as its leaves are occasionally abundant in the Late Glacial, often minerogenic-rich, like the lake sediments of Scandinavian lakes. Physical evidence of a sharp decline in temperature over most of the Northern Hemisphere, discovered by geological research, has been the key physical evidence found for the Younger Dryas.  This temperature change occurred at the end of what the earth sciences refer to as the Pleistocene epoch and immediately before the current, warmer Holocene epoch. 

Fats Waller<====>54958<====>Fats Waller  Thomas Wright "Fats" Waller (May 21, 1904 – December 15, 1943) was an American jazz pianist, organist, composer, singer, and comedic entertainer.  His innovations in the Harlem stride style laid the groundwork for modern jazz piano.  His best-known compositions, "Ain't Misbehavin'" and "Honeysuckle Rose", were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1984 and 1999.  Early lifeWaller was the youngest of 11 children (five of whom survived childhood) born to Adeline Locket Waller, a musician, and the Reverend Edward Martin Waller in New York City.He started playing the piano when he was six and graduated to playing the organ at his father's church four years later. 

Slave rebellion<====>54959<====>Slave rebellion A slave rebellion is an armed uprising by slaves.  Slave rebellions have occurred in nearly all societies that practice slavery or have practiced slavery in the past, and are amongst the most feared events for slaveholders. The most successful slave rebellion in history was the 18th-century Haitian Revolution, led by Toussaint Louverture and later Jean-Jacques Dessalines who won the war against their French colonial rulers, which founded the country formally known as Saint Domingue.  Other famous historic slave rebellions have been led by the Roman slave Spartacus (c.  73-71 BC), as well as the thrall (Scandinavian slave) Tunni, who rebelled against the Swedish monarch Ongentheow, a rebellion that needed Danish assistance to be quelled. 

Nat Turner<====>54960<====>Nat Turner Nat Turner  (October 2, 1800 – November 11, 1831) was an enslaved African American who led a rebellion of slaves and free blacks in Southampton County, Virginia on August 21, 1831. The rebels went from plantation to plantation, gathering horses and guns, freeing other slaves along the way, and recruiting other blacks who wanted to join their revolt.  During the rebellion, Virginia legislators targeted free blacks with a colonization bill, which allocated new funding to remove them, and a police bill that denied free blacks trials by jury and made any free blacks convicted of a crime subject to sale and relocation. 

Gin rummy<====>54961<====>Gin rummy Gin rummy, or simply gin, is a two-player card game created in 1909 by Elwood T.  Baker and his son C.  Graham Baker.  HistoryAccording to John Scarne, Gin evolved from 19th-century Whiskey Poker and was created with the intention of being faster than standard rummy but less spontaneous than knock rummy.John Scarne's theory deriving Rummy from Poker through the medium of Whiskey Poker has not gained general acceptance.  DeckGin is played with a standard 52-card pack of cards.  The ranking from high to low is King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace. 

Geophysics<====>54962<====>Geophysics Geophysics   is a subject of natural science concerned with the physical processes and physical properties of the Earth and its surrounding space environment, and the use of quantitative methods for their analysis.  The term geophysics sometimes refers only to the geological applications: Earth's shape; its gravitational and magnetic fields; its internal structure and composition; its dynamics and their surface expression in plate tectonics, the generation of magmas, volcanism and rock formation.However, modern geophysics organizations use a broader definition that includes the water cycle including snow and ice; fluid dynamics of the oceans and the atmosphere; electricity and magnetism in the ionosphere and magnetosphere and solar-terrestrial relations; and analogous problems associated with the Moon and other planets. 

Snail<====>54969<====>SnailSnail is a common name loosely applied to shelled gastropods.  The name is most often applied to land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs.  However, the common name snail is also used for most of the members of the molluscan class Gastropoda that have a coiled shell that is large enough for the animal to retract completely into.  When the word "snail" is used in this most general sense, it includes not just land snails but also numerous species of sea snails and freshwater snails.  Gastropods that naturally lack a shell, or have only an internal shell, are mostly called slugs, and land snails that have only a very small shell (that they cannot retract into) are often called semi-slugs. 

Treaty of Nanking<====>54972<====>Treaty of NankingThe Treaty of Nanking or Nanjing was a peace treaty which ended the First Opium War (1839–42) between the United Kingdom and the Qing dynasty of China on 29 August 1842.  It was the first of what the Chinese later called the unequal treaties on the ground that Britain had no obligations in return.  In the wake of China's military defeat, with British warships poised to attack Nanking, representatives from the British and Qing Empires negotiated on board HMS Cornwallis anchored at the city.  On 29 August 1842, British representative Sir Henry Pottinger and Qing representatives Qiying, Yilibu, and Niu Jian signed the treaty.

Adirondack Mountains<====>54980<====>Adirondack Mountains  The Adirondack Mountains   form a massif in northeastern New York, United States.  Its boundaries correspond to the boundaries of Adirondack Park.  The mountains form a roughly circular dome, about   in diameter and about   high.  The current relief owes much to glaciation.   HistoryThe earliest written use of the name, spelled Rontaks, was in 1724 by the French missionary Joseph-François Lafitau.  He defined it as tree eaters.  In the Mohawk language, Adirondack means porcupine, an animal that may eat bark.  The Mohawks had no written language at the time so Europeans have used various phonetic spellings.

Marillion<====>54989<====>Marillion   Marillion   are   a British rock band, formed in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, in 1979.  They emerged from the post-punk music scene in Britain and existed as a bridge between the styles of punk rock and classic progressive rock,  becoming the most commercially successful neo-progressive rock band of the 1980s.  Marillion's recorded studio output since 1982 is composed of eighteen albums, generally regarded in two distinct eras, delineated by the departure of original lead singer Fish in late 1988 and the subsequent arrival of replacement Steve Hogarth in early 1989.  The band achieved eight Top Ten UK albums between 1983 and 1994, including a number one album in 1985 with Misplaced Childhood, and during the period the band were fronted by Fish they scored eleven Top 40 hits on the UK Singles Chart.

It is one of the major tuberculin skin tests used around the world, largely replacing multiple-puncture tests such as the tine test.  The Heaf test, a form of tine test, was used until 2005 in the UK, when it was replaced by the Mantoux test.  The Mantoux test is endorsed by the American Thoracic Society and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

Prader–Willi syndrome<====>54996<====>Prader–Willi syndrome   Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder due to loss of function of specific genes.   In newborns symptoms include weak muscles, poor feeding, and slow development.   Beginning in childhood the person becomes constantly hungry which often leads to obesity and type 2 diabetes.   There is also typically mild to moderate intellectual impairment and behavioral problems.   Often the forehead is narrow, hands and feet small, height short, skin light in color, and those affected are unable to have children.   About 70% of cases occur when part of the father's chromosome 15 is deleted.

Fusion power<====>55017<====>Fusion powerFusion power is a form of power generation in which energy is generated by using fusion reactions to produce heat for electricity generation.  Fusion reactions fuse two lighter atomic nuclei to form a heavier nucleus, releasing energy.  Devices designed to harness this energy are known as fusion reactors. The fusion reaction normally takes place in a plasma of deuterium and tritium heated to millions of degrees.  In stars, gravity contains these fuels.  Outside of a star, the most researched way to confine the plasma at these temperatures is to use magnetic fields.  The major challenge in realising fusion power is to engineer a system that can confine the plasma long enough at high enough temperature and density. 

Jin dynasty (265–420)<====>55020<====>Jin dynasty (265–420)The Jin dynasty,  distinguished as the   and  , was a Chinese dynasty, empire, and era traditionally dated from   265 to 420.  It was founded by Sima Yan, son of Sima Zhao who was made Prince of Jin and posthumously declared the founder of the dynasty.  It followed the Three Kingdoms period (220-280 AD), which ended with the conquest of Eastern Wu by the Jin. There are two main divisions in the history of the dynasty.  The   (265–316) was established as a successor state to Cao Wei after Sima Yan usurped the throne, and had its capital at Luoyang or Chang'an (modern Xi'an); Western Jin reunited China in 280, but fairly shortly thereafter fell into a succession crisis, civil war, and invasion by the "Five Barbarians.

Gait<====>55022<====>Gait Gait is the pattern of movement of the limbs of animals, including humans, during locomotion over a solid substrate.  Most animals use a variety of gaits, selecting gait based on speed, terrain, the need to  , and energetic efficiency.   Different animal species may use different gaits due to differences in anatomy that prevent use of certain gaits, or simply due to evolved innate preferences as a result of habitat differences.   While various gaits are given specific names, the complexity of biological systems and interacting with the environment make these distinctions 'fuzzy' at best. 

Jin dynasty (1115–1234)<====>55023<====>Jin dynasty (1115–1234)  The Jin dynasty, officially known as the Great Jin, lasted from 1115 to 1234 as one of the last dynasties in Chinese history to predate the Mongol invasion of China.  Its name is sometimes written as Kin, Jurchen Jin or Jinn in English to differentiate it from an earlier Jìn dynasty of China whose name is identical when transcribed without tone marker diacritics in the Hanyu Pinyin system for Standard Chinese.   It is also sometimes called the "Jurchen dynasty" or the "Jurchen Jin", because its founding Emperor Taizu of Jin (reign 1115–1123) was of Wanyan Jurchen descent.

This usage originated in the orthographies created by Christian missionaries to transcribe these languages. Later, the practice was continued by Americanist anthropologists and linguists who still follow this convention in phonetic transcription to the present day (see Americanist phonetic notation).The ogonek is also used in academic transliteration of Old Church Slavonic. In Polish, Old Church Slavonic, Navajo, Western Apache, Chiricahua, Tłįch Yatiì, Slavey, Dëne Sųłiné and Elfdalian it indicates that the vowel is nasalized . Even if ę is nasalized e in Polish, ą is nasalized o, not a because of a vowel shift in which "ą", originally a long nasal "a", turned into a short nasal "o" when the vowel quantity distinction disappeared.LengthIn Lithuanian, the nosinė (literally, "nasal") mark originally indicated vowel nasalization but around the end of the 17th century, nasal vowels gradually evolved into corresponding long non-nasal vowels in most dialects. Thus, the mark is now de facto an indicator of vowel length (the length of etymologically non-nasal vowels is marked differently in writing). The mark also is useful for distinguishing different grammatical forms that would otherwise have the same written form even if they are pronounced differently.OpennessIn Rheinische Dokumenta, it marks vowels that are more open than those denoted by their base letters Ää, Oo, Öö. In two cases, it can be combined with umlaut marks.Similar diacriticsE caudata and o caudataThe E caudata (ę), a symbol similar to an e with ogonek, evolved from a ligature of a and e in medieval scripts, in Latin and Irish palaeography.  The O caudata of Old Norse  (letter ǫ, with ǫ́)   is used to write the open-mid back rounded vowel,  .  Medieval Nordic manuscripts show this "hook" in both directions, in combination with several vowels.   Despite this distinction, the term "ogonek" is sometimes used in discussions of typesetting and encoding Norse texts, as o caudata is typographically identical to o with ogonek.Cedilla and commaThe ogonek is functionally equivalent to the cedilla and comma diacritics. If two of these three are used within the same orthography their respective use is restricted to certain classes of letters, i.e. usually the ogonek is used with vowels whereas the cedilla is applied to consonants. In handwritten text the marks may even look the same.Typographical notesThe ogonek should be almost the same size as a descender (in larger type sizes may be relatively quite shorter) and should not be confused with the cedilla or comma diacritic marks used in other languages.When used for Native American languages, the ogonek should be placed directly under the letter rather than to the side as is the norm for European languages. European-style placement is acceptable when no other alternatives are available .EncodingLaTeX2eIn LaTeX2e, macro  \k  will typeset a letter with ogonek, if it is supported by the font encoding, e.g.  \k{a}  will typeset ą.  (The default LaTeX OT1 encoding does not support it, but the newer T1 one does.  It may be enabled by saying  \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}  in the preamble.)However,  \k{e}  rather places the diacritic "right-aligned" with the carrying e (ę), suitably for Polish, while  \textogonekcentered  horizontally centers the diacritic with respect to the carrier, suitably for Native American Languages as well as for e caudata and o caudata. So  \textogonekcentered{e}  better fits the latter purposes. Actually,  \k{o}  (for ǫ) is defined to result in  \textogonekcentered{o} , and  \k{O}  is defined to result in  \textogonekcentered{O} . The package TIPA, activated by using the command " \usepackage{tipa} ", offers a different way: " \textpolhook{a} " will produce ą.

In addition, a few species of land crabs are eaten, for example Cardisoma guanhumi in the Caribbean. Despite the name, shellfish are not a kind of fish, but are simply water-dwelling animals.   Many varieties of shellfish (crustaceans in particular) are actually closely related to insects and arachnids, making up one of the main classes of the phylum Arthropoda. 

Reconstruction Era<====>55040<====>Reconstruction Era   The term Reconstruction Era, in the context of the history of the United States, has two senses: the first covers the complete history of the entire country from 1865 to 1877 following the American Civil War (1861 to 1865); the second sense focuses on the attempted transformation of the Southern United States from 1863 to 1877, as directed by Congress, from states with economies dependent upon slavery, to states in which former slaves were citizens with civil rights.   With the three Reconstruction Amendments, the era saw the first amendments to the U. S.  Constitution in decades.

For names above the rank of family the principle of priority is not obligatory, hence the difference between the two names.References 

Batales<====>55052<====>Batales Batales is a botanical name of an order of flowering plants.  This name was used in several systems, sometimes in the spelling Batidales. Often this order consisted of the genus Batis only.  In the 1981 version of the Cronquist system it was an order placed in subclass Dilleniidae with the following  :order Batalesfamily Gyrostemonaceaefamily BataceaeThe APG II system, used here, includes all the plants involved in the (expanded) order Brassicales.

Nepenthales<====>55054<====>NepenthalesNepenthales (Nepenthales Bercht.  & J.

China proper<====>55063<====>China proper  China proper, Inner China or the Eighteen Provinces  was a term used by Western writers on the Manchu Qing dynasty to express a distinction between the core and frontier regions of China.  There is no fixed extent for China proper, as many administrative, cultural, and linguistic shifts have occurred in Chinese history.  One definition refers to the original area of Chinese civilization, the North China Plain; another to the "Eighteen Provinces" system of the Qing dynasty.  There is no direct translation for "China proper" in the Chinese language due to differences in terminology used by the Qing to refer to the regions and the expression is controversial among scholars, particularly in China, partly because it implies the frontier regions outside China proper are in some way separate or even illegitimate territories of China.

" The precise definition of "cultural genocide" remains unclear.  Some ethnologists, such as Robert Jaulin, use the term "ethnocide" as a substitute for "cultural genocide",  although this usage has been criticized as engendering a risk of confusing ethnicity with culture.

André Breton<====>55167<====>André Breton   André Breton ( ; 19 February 1896 – 28 September 1966) was a French writer, poet, and anti-fascist.  He is known best as the founder of Surrealism.  His writings include the first Surrealist Manifesto (Manifeste du surréalisme) of 1924, in which he defined surrealism as "pure psychic automatism".  Biography Born to a family of modest means in Tinchebray (Orne) in Normandy, France.  Breton attended medical school where he developed a particular interest in mental illness.His education was interrupted when he was drafted for World War I.  During World War I he worked in a neurological ward in Nantes, where he met the devotee of Alfred Jarry, Jacques Vaché, whose anti-social attitude and disdain for established artistic tradition influenced Breton considerably. 

Corporal punishment<====>55169<====>Corporal punishment    Corporal punishment or physical punishment is a punishment intended to cause physical pain on a person.  It is most often practiced on minors, especially in home and school settings.  Common methods include spanking or paddling.  It has also historically been used on adults, particularly on prisoners and enslaved persons.  Other common methods include flagellation and caning.  Official punishment for crime by inflicting pain or injury, including flogging, branding and even mutilation, was practised in most civilizations since ancient times.   However, with the growth of humanitarian ideals since the Enlightenment, such punishments were increasingly viewed as inhumane. 

Genomics<====>55170<====>Genomics  Genomics is an interdisciplinary field of science focusing on the structure, function, evolution, mapping, and editing of genomes.  A genome is an organism's complete set of DNA, including all of its genes.  In contrast to genetics, which refers to the study of individual genes and their roles in inheritance, genomics aims at the collective characterization and quantification of genes, which direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and messenger molecules.  In turn, proteins make up body structures such as organs and tissues as well as control chemical reactions and carry signals between cells. 

Proteomics<====>55172<====>Proteomics Proteomics is the large-scale study of proteins.    Proteins are vital parts of living organisms, with many functions.  The term proteomics was coined in 1997  in analogy with genomics, the study of the genome.  The word proteome is a portmanteau of protein and genome, and was coined by Marc Wilkins in 1994 while he was a PhD student at Macquarie University.   Macquarie University also founded the first dedicated proteomics laboratory in 1995  (the Australian Proteome Analysis Facility – APAF).  . The proteome is the entire set of proteins that are produced or modified by an organism or system. 

Falun Gong<====>55174<====>Falun Gong  Falun Gong   or Falun Dafa   (Standard Mandarin Chinese:  ; literally, "Dharma Wheel Practice" or "Law Wheel Practice") is a modern Chinese spiritual practice that combines meditation and qigong exercises with a moral philosophy centered on the tenets of truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance ( ).  The practice emphasizes morality and the cultivation of virtue, and identifies as a qigong practice of the Buddhist school, though its teachings also incorporate elements drawn from Taoist traditions.  Through moral rectitude and the practice of meditation, practitioners of Falun Gong aspire to eliminate attachments, and ultimately to achieve spiritual enlightenment. 

Biotope<====>55175<====>BiotopeA biotope is an area of uniform environmental conditions providing a living place for a specific assemblage of plants and animals.  Biotope is almost synonymous with the term habitat, which is more commonly used in English-speaking countries.  However, in some countries these two terms are distinguished: the subject of a habitat is a population, the subject of a biotope is a biocoenosis or biological community.   It is an English loanword derived from the German Biotop, which in turn came from the Greek bios, "life" and topos, "place".  (The related word geotope has made its way into the English language by the same route, from the German Geotop. 

Motorola 88000<====>55176<====>Motorola 88000 The 88000 (m88k for short) is a RISC instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by Motorola.   The 88000 was Motorola's attempt at a home-grown RISC architecture, started in the 1980s.   The 88000 arrived on the market some two years after the competing SPARC and MIPS.  Due to the late start and extensive delays releasing the second-generation MC88110, the m88k achieved very limited success outside of the MVME platform and embedded controller environments. HistoryOriginally called the 78000 as a homage to their famed 68000 series, the design went through a tortuous development path, including the number change, before finally emerging in April 1988. 

Restionales<====>55177<====>Restionales Restionales is a botanical name for an order of flowering plants. In the Cronquist system (of 1981) it is used for an order (in subclass Commelinidae) and circumscribed as:order Restionalesfamily Flagellariaceaefamily Joinvilleaceaefamily Restionaceaefamily CentrolepidaceaeThe APG II system (2003) assigns the plants involved to the order Poales.

Juncales<====>55180<====>Juncales Juncales is a botanical name for an order of flowering plants. In the Engler system (update, of 1964) and in the Cronquist system (of 1981, which placed this order in subclass Commelinidae) it is circumscribed as:order Juncalesfamily Juncaceaefamily ThurniaceaeHowever, the Thorne system (1992) accepts it as consisting of :order Juncalesfamily Prioniaceaefamily Thurniaceaefamily Juncaceaefamily CyperaceaeThe APG II system, used here, assigns the plants involved to the order Poales.

It operated as an umbrella project under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation, and all Jakarta products are released under the Apache License.  As of December 21, 2011 the Jakarta project was retired because no subprojects were remaining. ==Subprojects== Major contributions by the Jakarta Project include tools, libraries and frameworks such as:BCEL - a Java byte code manipulation libraryBSF - a scripting frameworkCactus - a unit testing framework for server-side Java classesApache JMeter - a load- and stress-testing tool. The following projects were formerly part of Jakarta, but now form independent projects within the Apache Software Foundation:Ant - a build toolCommons - a collection of useful classes intended to complement Java's standard library. 

Hydatellales<====>55183<====>HydatellalesHydatellales is a botanical name for an order of flowering plants.  In the Cronquist system, 1981, the name was used for an order placed in the subclass Commelinidae in class Liliopsida [=monocotyledons].  The order consisted of one family only:order Hydatellalesfamily HydatellaceaeSimilarly the Dahlgren system recognised this order (with the same circumscription and placed it in superorder Commelinanae in subclass Liliidae [=monocotyledons]. The APG II system assigns these plants to the order Poales, close to the grasses and sedges.  Recent study by Saarela et al. ,  however, suggests a position out of the Poales; here, the Hydatellaceae link with the waterlilies, the first time a plant has been ejected from the monocots. 

Hop (telecommunications)<====>55184<====>Hop (telecommunications)  In telecommunication, a hop is a portion of a signal's journey from source to receiver.  Examples include:The excursion of a radio wave from the Earth to the ionosphere and back to the Earth.   The number of hops indicates the number of reflections from the ionosphere.  A similar excursion from an earth station to a communications satellite to another station, counted similarly except that if the return trip is not by satellite, then it's only a half hop. In routing, a hop is the step from one router to the next, on the path of a packet on any communications network. 

Typhales<====>55185<====>Typhales Typhales is a botanical name for an order of flowering plants. In the Cronquist system the name was used for an order placed in the subclass Commelinidae. The order consisted of (1981):order Typhalesfamily Sparganiaceaefamily TyphaceaeThe APG IV system, used here, assigns the plants involved to the order Poales. 

Barbara McClintock<====>55188<====>Barbara McClintock  Barbara McClintock (June 16, 1902 – September 2, 1992) was an American scientist and cytogeneticist who was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.  McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927.  There she started her career as the leader in the development of maize cytogenetics, the focus of her research for the rest of her life.  From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize.  She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. 

Albula Alps<====>55192<====>Albula Alps The Albula Alps are a mountain range in the Alps of eastern Switzerland.  They are considered to be part of the Central Eastern Alps, more specifically the Western Rhaetian Alps.   They are named after the river Albula.  The Albula Alps are separated from the Oberhalbstein Alps in the west by the Septimer Pass and the valley of the Sursés; from the Plessur Alps in the north-west by the Landwasser valley; from the Silvretta group in the north-east by the Flüela Pass; from the Bernina Range in the south-east by the Maloja Pass and the Inn valley (upper Engadine). 

Lepontine Alps<====>55196<====>Lepontine Alps The Lepontine Alps ( ,  ,  ) are a mountain range in the north-western part of the Alps.  They are located in Switzerland (Valais, Ticino, Uri and Graubünden) and Italy (Piedmont and Lombardy). The Simplon rail tunnel (from Brig to Domodossola) the Gotthard rail (from Erstfeld to Bodio) and Gotthard road tunnels (from Andermatt to Airolo) and the San Bernardino road tunnel are important transport arteries. The eastern portion of the Lepontine Alps, from the St Gotthard Pass to the Splügen Pass, is sometimes named the Adula Alps, while the western part is historically referred to as the Ticino Alps. 

Mössbauer effect<====>55199<====>Mössbauer effect The Mössbauer effect, or recoilless nuclear resonance fluorescence, is a physical phenomenon discovered by Rudolf Mössbauer in 1958.  It involves the resonant and recoil-free emission and absorption of gamma radiation by atomic nuclei bound in a solid.  Its main application is in Mössbauer spectroscopy. In the Mössbauer effect, a narrow resonance for nuclear gamma emission and absorption results from the momentum of recoil being delivered to a surrounding crystal lattice rather than to the emitting or absorbing nucleus alone.  When this occurs, no gamma energy is lost to the kinetic energy of recoiling nuclei at either the emitting or absorbing end of a gamma transition: emission and absorption occur at the same energy, resulting in strong, resonant absorption.

They form a part of the Southern Limestone Alps and extend from the River Adige in the west to the Piave Valley (Pieve di Cadore) in the east.  The northern and southern borders are defined by the Puster Valley and the Sugana Valley (Italian: Valsugana).  The Dolomites are nearly equally shared between the provinces of Belluno, South Tyrol and Trentino. There are also mountain groups of similar geological structure that spread over the River Piave to the east – Dolomiti d'Oltrepiave; and far away over the Adige River to the west – Dolomiti di Brenta (Western Dolomites). 

Dauphiné Alps<====>55203<====>Dauphiné Alps The Dauphiné Alps ( ) are a group of mountain ranges in southeastern France, west of the main chain of the Alps.  Mountain ranges within the Dauphiné Alps include the Massif des Écrins (in the Parc national des Écrins), Belledonne, the Taillefer range and the mountains of Matheysine. EtymologyThe Dauphiné ( ) is a former French province whose area roughly corresponded to that of the present departments of Isère, Drôme, and Hautes-Alpes. GeographyThey are separated from the Cottian Alps in the east by the Col du Galibier and the upper Durance valley; from the western Graian Alps (Vanoise Massif) in the north-east by the river Arc; from the lower ranges Vercors Plateau and Chartreuse Mountains in the west by the rivers Drac and Isère. 

Swiss Alps<====>55205<====>Swiss AlpsThe Alpine region of Switzerland, conventionally referred to as the Swiss Alps ( ,  ,  ,  ), represents a major natural feature of the country and is, along with the Swiss Plateau and the Swiss portion of the Jura Mountains, one of its three main physiographic regions.  The Swiss Alps extend over both the Western Alps and the Eastern Alps, encompassing an area sometimes called Central Alps.   While the northern ranges from the Bernese Alps to the Appenzell Alps are entirely in Switzerland, the southern ranges from the Mont Blanc massif to the Bernina massif are shared with other countries such as France, Italy, Austria and Liechtenstein. 

Maritime Alps<====>55206<====>Maritime Alps The Maritime Alps (   ;    ) are a mountain range in the southwestern part of the Alps.  They form the border between the French region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur and the Italian regions of Piedmont and Liguria.  They are the southernmost part of the Alps. GeographyAdministratively the range is divided between the Italian provinces of Cuneo and Imperia (eastern slopes) and the French department of Alpes-Maritimes (western slopes). The Maritime Alps are drained by the rivers Roya, Var and Verdon and their tributaries on the French side; by the Stura di Demonte and other tributaries of the Tanaro and Po on the Italian side. 

Glarus Alps<====>55207<====>Glarus Alps  The Glarus Alps ( ) are a mountain range in central Switzerland.  They are bordered by the Uri Alps and the Schwyz Alps to the west, the Lepontine Alps to the south, the Appenzell Alps to the northeast.  The eastern part of the Glarus Alps contains a major thrust fault which was declared a geologic UNESCO world heritage site (the Swiss Tectonic Arena Sardona). The Glarus Alps extend well beyond the canton of Glarus, including parts of the cantons of Uri, Graubünden, and St Gallen.  Conversely, not all the mountains in the canton of Glarus are part of the Glarus Alps, with those to the north of the Urner Boden and to the west of the valley of the river Linth considered to be part of the Schwyz Alps. 

Cottian Alps<====>55208<====>Cottian Alps The Cottian Alps ( ;    ;    ); are a mountain range in the southwestern part of the Alps.  They form the border between France (Hautes-Alpes and Savoie) and Italy (Piedmont).  The Fréjus Road Tunnel and Fréjus Rail Tunnel between Modane and Susa are important transportation arteries between France (Lyon, Grenoble) and Italy (Turin). EtymologyThe name Cottian comes from Marcus Julius Cottius, a king of the tribes inhabiting that mountainous region in the 1st century BC.  These tribes had previously opposed but later made peace with Julius Caesar.  Cottius was succeeded by his son, also named Marcus Julius Cottius, who was granted the title of king by the emperor Claudius. 

Pennine Alps<====>55209<====>Pennine Alps  The Pennine Alps ( ,  ,  ,  ), also known as the Valais Alps, are a mountain range in the western part of the Alps.  They are located in Switzerland (Valais) and Italy (Piedmont and the Aosta Valley). GeographyThe Italian side is drained by the rivers Dora Baltea, Sesia and Toce, tributaries of the Po.  The Swiss side is drained by the Rhône. The Great St Bernard Tunnel, under the Great St Bernard Pass, leads from Martigny, Switzerland to Aosta. MorphologyThe main chain (watershed between the Mediterranean Sea and Adriatic Sea) runs from west to east on the border between Italy (south) and Switzerland (north). 

Bernese Alps<====>55210<====>Bernese Alps The Bernese Alps ( ,  ,  ) are a mountain range of the Alps, located in western Switzerland.  Although the name suggests that they are located in the Berner Oberland region of the canton of Bern, portions of the Bernese Alps are in the adjacent cantons of Valais, Fribourg and Vaud, the latter being usually named Fribourg Alps and Vaud Alps respectively.  The highest mountain in the range, the Finsteraarhorn, is also the highest point in the canton of Bern. The Rhône valley separates them from the Chablais Alps in the west and from the Pennine Alps in the south; the upper Rhône valley separate them from the Lepontine Alps to the southeast; the Grimsel Pass and the Aare valley separates them from the Uri Alps in the east and from the Emmental Alps in the north; their northwestern edge is not so well defined, describing a line roughly from Lake Geneva to Lake Thun. 

Graian Alps<====>55211<====>Graian Alps The Graian Alps (   ;    ) are a mountain range in the western part of the Alps. EtymologyThe name Graie comes from the Graioceli Celtic tribe, which dwelled in the area surrounding the Mont Cenis pass and the Viù valley.  Other sources claim that the name comes from the Celtic "Graig" meaning rock/stone, literally the Rocky Mountains GeographyThe Graian Alps are located in France (Rhône-Alpes), Italy (Piedmont and the Aosta Valley), and Switzerland (western Valais). The French side of the Graian Alps is drained by the river Isère (Tarentaise valley) and its tributary Arc (Maurienne valley), and by the Arve. 

Newton's laws of motion<====>55212<====>Newton's laws of motion Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws that, together, laid the foundation for classical mechanics.  They describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and its motion in response to those forces.  More precisely, the first law defines the force qualitatively, the second law offers a quantitative measure of the force, and the third asserts that a single isolated force doesn't exist.  These three laws have been expressed in several ways, over nearly three centuries, For explanations of Newton's laws of motion by Newton in the early 18th century, by the physicist William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) in the mid-19th century, and by a modern text of the early 21st century, see:-Newton's "Axioms or Laws of Motion" starting on page 19 of volume 1 of the 1729 translation of the Principia;Section 242, Newton's laws of motion in Thomson, W (Lord Kelvin), and Tait, P G, (1867), Treatise on natural philosophy, volume 1; andBenjamin Crowell (2000), Newtonian Physics.

It has a cage-like fused-ring structure (truncated icosahedron) that resembles a soccer ball (football), made of twenty hexagons and twelve pentagons, with a carbon atom at each vertex of each polygon and a bond along each polygon edge. Preparation and occurrenceIt was first generated in 1985 by Harold Kroto, James R.  Heath, Sean O'Brien, Robert Curl, and Richard Smalley at Rice University.   Kroto, Curl and Smalley were awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their roles in the discovery of buckminsterfullerene and the related class of molecules, the fullerenes. 

Baire category theorem<====>55227<====>Baire category theoremThe Baire category theorem (BCT) is an important tool in general topology and functional analysis.  The theorem has two forms, each of which gives sufficient conditions for a topological space to be a Baire space. The theorem was proved by René-Louis Baire in his 1899 doctoral thesis. Statement of the theoremA Baire space is a topological space with the following property: for each countable collection of open dense sets  \{U_n\}_{n=1}^\infty , their intersection  \textstyle\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty U_n  is dense. (BCT1) Every complete metric space is a Baire space.   More generally, every topological space which is homeomorphic to an open subset of a complete pseudometric space is a Baire space. 

Bushranger<====>55229<====>Bushranger  Bushrangers were originally escaped convicts in the early years of the British settlement of Australia who had the survival skills necessary to use the Australian bush as a refuge to hide from the authorities.  By the 1820s, the term "bushranger" had evolved to refer to those who abandoned social rights and privileges to take up "robbery under arms" as a way of life, using the bush as their base. Bushranging thrived during the gold rush years of the 1850s and 1860s when the likes of Ben Hall, Frank Gardiner and John Gilbert led notorious gangs in the country districts of New South Wales.

Astronomical objects commonly studied in this field may include black holes, neutron stars, active galactic nuclei, supernovae, supernova remnants, and gamma ray bursts.MissionsSome space and ground based telescopes that have studied high energy astronomy include the following:  AGILEAMS-02AUGERCALETChandraFermiH.E.S.S.IceCubeINTEGRALMAGICNuSTARSwiftTAXMM-Newton References External linksNASA's High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center  - great compendium of links   

Larrea tridentata<====>55235<====>Larrea tridentata Larrea tridentata is known as creosote bush and greasewood    as a plant, chaparral as a medicinal herb,  and as gobernadora in Mexico, Spanish for "governess", due to its ability to secure more water by inhibiting the growth of nearby plants.  In Sonora, it is more commonly called hediondilla.   It is a flowering plant in the family Zygophyllaceae.  The specific name tridentata refers to its three-toothed leaves. DistributionLarrea tridentata is a prominent species in the Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan Deserts of western North America, and its range includes those and other regions in portions of southeastern California, Arizona, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah, New Mexico, and Texas in the United States, and Chihuahua, Sonora, Coahuila,  Nuevo Leon, Zacatecas, Durango and San Luis Potosì in Mexico. 

Compton scattering<====>55236<====>Compton scattering Compton scattering, discovered by Arthur Holly Compton, is the  scattering of a photon by a charged particle, usually an electron.  It results in a decrease in energy (increase in wavelength) of the photon (which may be an X-ray or gamma ray photon), called the Compton effect.  Part of the energy of the photon is transferred to the recoiling electron.  Inverse Compton scattering occurs, in which a charged particle transfers part of its energy to a photon. IntroductionCompton scattering is an example of inelastic scattering  of light by a free charged particle, where the wavelength of the scattered light is different from that of the incident radiation. 

Hypersonic speed<====>55244<====>Hypersonic speed  In aerodynamics, a hypersonic speed is one that is highly supersonic.  Since the 1970s, the term has generally been assumed to refer to speeds of Mach 5 and above. The precise Mach number at which a craft can be said to be flying at hypersonic speed varies, since individual physical changes in the airflow (like molecular dissociation and ionization) occur at different speeds; these effects collectively become important around Mach 5.  The hypersonic regime is often alternatively defined as speeds where ramjets do not produce net thrust. Characteristics of flowWhile the definition of hypersonic flow can be quite vague and is generally debatable (especially due to the absence of discontinuity between supersonic and hypersonic flows), a hypersonic flow may be characterized by certain physical phenomena that can no longer be analytically discounted as in supersonic flow. 

Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird<====>55245<====>Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird  The Lockheed SR-71 "Blackbird" is a long-range, Mach 3+ strategic reconnaissance aircraft that was operated by the United States Air Force.    It was developed as a black project from the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft in the 1960s by Lockheed and its Skunk Works division.  American aerospace engineer Clarence "Kelly" Johnson was responsible for many of the design's innovative concepts.  During aerial reconnaissance missions, the SR-71 operated at high speeds and altitudes to allow it to outrace threats.  If a surface-to-air missile launch were detected, the standard evasive action was simply to accelerate and outfly the missile.

Road train<====>55265<====>Road train  A road train or land train is a trucking vehicle of a type used in rural and remote areas of Australia, Canada, Mexico and the United States, to move freight efficiently.   The term road train is mainly used in Australia.  A road train has a relatively normal tractor unit, but instead of towing one trailer or semi-trailer, it pulls three or more of them. HistoryEarly road trains consisted of traction engines pulling multiple wagons.  The first identified road trains operated into South Australia's Flinders Ranges from the Port Augusta area in the mid 19th century.

Francisco Pizarro<====>55271<====>Francisco PizarroFrancisco Pizarro González ( ;  ;   – 26 June 1541) was a Spanish conquistador who led an expedition that conquered the Inca Empire.  He captured and killed Incan emperor Atahualpa, and claimed the lands for Spain. Early lifeFrancisco Pizarro was born in Trujillo, Cáceres, Spain (then in the Crown of Castile) in modern-day Extremadura, Spain.  He was the illegitimate son of infantry colonel Gonzalo Pizarro (1446–1522) and Francisca González, a woman of poor means.  His date of birth is uncertain, but it is believed to be sometime in the 1470s, probably 1474. 

Manchukuo<====>55273<====>Manchukuo   Manchukuo ( ) was a puppet state of the Empire of Japan in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia from 1932 until 1945.  It was initially governed as a republic, but in 1934 it became a constitutional monarchy.  It had limited international recognition and was de facto under the control of Japan. The area, collectively known as Manchuria by westerners and Japanese, was the homeland of the Manchus, including the emperors of the Qing Dynasty.  In 1931, the region was seized by Japan following the Mukden Incident and a pro-Japanese government was installed one year later with Puyi, the last Qing emperor, as the nominal regent and emperor. 

Denotational semantics<====>55275<====>Denotational semanticsIn computer science, denotational semantics (initially known as mathematical semantics or Scott–Strachey semantics) is an approach of formalizing the meanings of programming languages by constructing mathematical objects (called denotations) that describe the meanings of expressions from the languages.  Other approaches to providing formal semantics of programming languages include axiomatic semantics and operational semantics. Broadly speaking, denotational semantics is concerned with finding mathematical objects called domains that represent what programs do.   For example, programs (or program phrases) might be represented by partial functions or by games between the environment and the system. An important tenet of denotational semantics is that semantics should be compositional: the denotation of a program phrase should be built out of the denotations of its subphrases. 

Warp drive<====>55278<====>Warp drive  A warp drive is a ficticious faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft propulsion system in many science fiction works, most notably Star Trek.  A spacecraft equipped with a warp drive may travel at speeds greater than that of light by many orders of magnitude.  In contrast to some other ficticious FTL technologies such as a jump drive or hyper drive, the warp drive does not permit instantaneous travel between two points but involves a measurable passage of time which is pertinent to the concept.  Spacecraft at warp velocity would continue to interact with objects in "normal space". 

James Dewar<====>55279<====>James Dewar    Sir James Dewar FRS FRSE (20 September 1842 – 27 March 1923) was a Scottish chemist and physicist.

He was also particularly interested in atomic and molecular spectroscopy, working in these fields for more than 25 years. Early lifeJames Dewar was born in Kincardine, Perthshire (now in Fife) in 1842, the youngest of six boys of Thomas Dewar, a vintner, and his wife, Ann Dewar.  https://www. 

Canning Stock Route<====>55283<====>Canning Stock Route  The Canning Stock Route is a track that runs from Halls Creek in the Kimberley region of Western Australia to Wiluna in the mid-west region.  With a total distance of around 1,850 km (1,150 mi) it is the longest historic stock route in the world.   The stock route was proposed as a way of breaking a monopoly that west Kimberley cattlemen had on the beef trade at the beginning of the 20th century.  In 1906, the Government of Western Australia appointed Alfred Canning to survey the route.  When the survey party returned to Perth, Canning's treatment of Aboriginal guides came under scrutiny leading to a Royal Commission. 

Coat of arms<====>55284<====>Coat of arms   A coat of arms is an heraldic visual design on an escutcheon (i. e. , shield), surcoat, or tabard.  The coat of arms on an escutcheon forms the central element of the full heraldic achievement which in its whole consists of shield, supporters, crest, and motto.  A coat of arms is traditionally unique to an individual person, family (except in the United Kingdom),  state, organisation or corporation.  HistoryBackgroundThe ancient Greek hoplites used individual insignia on their shields.    The ancient Romans used similar insignia on their shields, but these identified military units. 

Ernst Mach<====>55285<====>Ernst Mach   Ernst Waldfried Josef Wenzel Mach ( ;  ; 18 February 1838 – 19 February 1916) was an Austrian  physicist and philosopher, noted for his contributions to physics such as study of shock waves.  The ratio of one's speed to that of sound is named the Mach number in his honor.  As a philosopher of science, he was a major influence on logical positivism and American pragmatism.    Through his criticism of Newton's theories of space and time, he foreshadowed Einstein's theory of relativity. BiographyErnst Waldfried Josef Wenzel Mach was born in Chrlice ( ), Moravia (then in the Austrian empire, now part of Brno in the Czech Republic).

Net present value<====>55345<====>Net present value In finance, the net present value (NPV) or net present worth (NPW)    is a measurement of profit calculated by subtracting the present values (PV) of cash outflows (including initial cost) from the present values of cash inflows over a period of time.   Incoming and outgoing cash flows can also be described as benefit and cost cash flows, respectively.    Time value of money dictates that time affects the value of cash flows.  In other words, a lender may give you 99 cents for the promise of receiving $1. 00 a month from now, but the promise to receive that same dollar 20 years in the future would be worth much less today to that same person (lender), even if the payback in both cases was equally certain. 

Hierarchical File System<====>55347<====>Hierarchical File System  Hierarchical File System (HFS) is a proprietary file system developed by Apple Inc.  for use in computer systems running Mac OS.  Originally designed for use on floppy and hard disks, it can also be found on read-only media such as CD-ROMs.  HFS is also referred to as Mac OS Standard (or, erroneously, "HFS Standard"), while its successor, HFS Plus, is also called Mac OS Extended (or, erroneously, "HFS Extended"). With the introduction of Mac OS X 10. 6, Apple dropped support for formatting or writing HFS disks and images, which remain supported as read-only volumes. 

RAM drive<====>55349<====>RAM drive  A RAM drive (also called a RAM disk) is a block of random-access memory (primary storage or volatile memory) that a computer's software is treating as if the memory were a disk drive (secondary storage).   It is sometimes referred to as a virtual RAM drive or software RAM drive to distinguish it from a hardware RAM drive that uses separate hardware containing RAM, which is a type of battery-backed solid-state drive. PerformanceThe performance of a RAM drive is in general orders of magnitude faster than other forms of storage media, such as an SSD, hard drive, tape drive, or optical drive. 

Jeet Kune Do<====>55351<====>Jeet Kune DoJeet Kune Do ( ;  ), abbreviated JKD, is a hybrid philosophy of martial arts heavily influenced by the personal philosophy and experiences of martial artist Bruce Lee.  Lee, who founded the system on July 9, 1969, referred to it as "non-classical", suggesting that JKD is a form of Chinese Kung Fu, yet without form.  Unlike more traditional martial arts, Jeet Kune Do is not fixed or patterned, and is a philosophy with guiding thoughts.  It was named for the Wing Chun concept of interception or attacking while one's opponent is about to attack.

SIMD<====>55359<====>SIMD   Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD), is a class of parallel computers in Flynn's taxonomy.  It describes computers with multiple processing elements that perform the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously.  Thus, such machines exploit data level parallelism, but not concurrency: there are simultaneous (parallel) computations, but only a single process (instruction) at a given moment.  SIMD is particularly applicable to common tasks such as adjusting the contrast in a digital image or adjusting the volume of digital audio.  Most modern CPU designs include SIMD instructions to improve the performance of multimedia use. 

AltiVec<====>55360<====>AltiVec AltiVec is a single-precision floating point and integer SIMD instruction set designed and owned by Apple, IBM, and Freescale Semiconductor (formerly Motorola's Semiconductor Products Sector) — the AIM alliance.   It is implemented on versions of the PowerPC processor architecture, including Motorola's G4, IBM's G5 and POWER6 processors, and P. A.  Semi's PWRficient PA6T.   AltiVec is a trademark owned solely by Freescale, so the system is also referred to as Velocity Engine by Apple and VMX (Vector Multimedia Extension) by IBM and P. A.  Semi. While AltiVec refers to an instruction set, the implementations in CPUs produced by IBM and Motorola are separate in terms of logic design.

MMX (instruction set)<====>55364<====>MMX (instruction set) MMX is a single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) instruction set designed by Intel, introduced in 1997 with its P5-based Pentium line of microprocessors, designated as "Pentium with MMX Technology".   It developed out of a similar unit introduced on the Intel i860,  and earlier the Intel i750 video pixel processor.  MMX is a processor supplementary capability that is supported on recent IA-32 processors by Intel and other vendors. MMX has subsequently been extended by several programs by Intel and others: 3DNow!, Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE), and ongoing revisions of Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX). OverviewNamingMMX is officially a meaningless initialism trademarked by Intel;  unofficially, the initials have been variously explained as standing for MultiMedia eXtension, Multiple Math eXtension, or Matrix Math eXtension. 

Streaming SIMD Extensions<====>55365<====>Streaming SIMD Extensions In computing, Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) is an SIMD instruction set extension to the x86 architecture, designed by Intel and introduced in 1999 in their Pentium III series of processors shortly after the appearance of AMD's 3DNow!.  SSE contains 70 new instructions, most of which work on single precision floating point data.  SIMD instructions can greatly increase performance when exactly the same operations are to be performed on multiple data objects.  Typical applications are digital signal processing and graphics processing. Intel's first IA-32 SIMD effort was the MMX instruction set.  MMX had two main problems: it re-used existing floating point registers making the CPU unable to work on both floating point and SIMD data at the same time, and it only worked on integers.

Hercules (emulator)<====>55374<====>Hercules (emulator) Hercules is a computer emulator allowing software written for IBM mainframe computers (System/370, System/390, and zSeries/System z) and for plug compatible mainframes (such as Amdahl machines) to run on other types of computer hardware, notably on low-cost personal computers. Although there are other mainframe emulators performing a similar function, Hercules is significant in enabling private individuals to run mainframe computer software on their own personal computers. Hercules runs under multiple parent operating systems including GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows, FreeBSD, Solaris, and Mac OS X and is released under the open source software license QPL.   It is analogous to Bochs and QEMU in that it emulates CPU instructions and select peripheral devices only. 

Coordination of Information on the Environment<====>55375<====>Coordination of Information on the EnvironmentCoordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) is a European programme initiated in 1985 by the European Commission, aimed at gathering information relating to the environment on certain priority topics for the European Union (air, water, soil, land cover, coastal erosion, biotopes, etc. ).  Since 1994, the European Environment Agency (EEA) integrated CORINE in its work programme.  EEA is responsible for providing objective, timely and targeted information on Europe's environment.

ELDIS<====>55377<====>ELDIS Eldis is a database and email service of information sources on international development.  It aims to share the best knowledge on development, policy, practice and research. Background"Eldis" was originally an acronym for "Electronic Development and Environment Information System".  It is one of a family of knowledge services produced at the Institute of Development Studies, Sussex, England. FundingEldis is funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). DatabaseThe information in Eldis is organised into subject-focused "resource guides" and regional and country "profiles. 

Disk partitioning<====>55380<====>Disk partitioning Disk partitioning or disk slicing  is the creation of one or more regions on a hard disk or other secondary storage, so that an operating system can manage information in each region separately.   Partitioning is typically the first step of preparing a newly manufactured disk, before any files or directories have been created.  The disk stores the information about the partitions' locations and sizes in an area known as the partition table that the operating system reads before any other part of the disk.  Each partition then appears in the operating system as a distinct "logical" disk that uses part of the actual disk. 

Supernatural<====>55382<====>Supernatural  The supernatural (Medieval Latin: supernātūrālis: supra "above" + naturalis "natural", first used: 1520–1530 AD)   are those things, or things that have been claimed to exist, which cannot be explained by the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other types of spirits and other non-material beings, or to things beyond nature.  Things such as lightning which were once though to be supernatural have been shown to be entirely naturalistic, and some people claim that there is nothing supernatural.  Such people maintain a skeptical attitude and belief.  At least one prize for proving the existence of any supernatural thing at all remains unclaimed. 

Hard disk drive platter<====>55383<====>Hard disk drive platter A hard disk drive platter (or disk) is the circular disk on which magnetic data is stored in a hard disk drive.  The rigid nature of the platters in a hard drive is what gives them their name (as opposed to the flexible materials which are used to make floppy disks).  Hard drives typically have several platters which are mounted on the same spindle.  A platter can store information on both sides, requiring two heads per platter. DesignThe magnetic surface of each platter is divided into small sub-micrometer-sized magnetic regions, each of which is used to represent a single binary unit of information. 

Ashkelon<====>55386<====>Ashkelon    Ashkelon (  also spelled Ashqelon and Ascalon;    ;    ) is a coastal city in the Southern District of Israel on the Mediterranean coast,   south of Tel Aviv, and   north of the border with the Gaza Strip.  The ancient seaport of Ashkelon dates back to the Neolithic Age.  In the course of its history, it has been ruled by the Ancient Egyptians, the Canaanites, the Philistines, the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the Greeks, the Phoenicians, the Hasmoneans, the Romans, the Persians, the Arabs and the Crusaders, until it was destroyed by the Mamluks in 1270.

". ,  ;    Ancient  Ġāzā), also referred to as Gaza City, is a Palestinian city in the Gaza Strip, with a population of 515,556, making it the largest city in the State of Palestine.  Inhabited since at least the 15th century BC,    Gaza has been dominated by several different peoples and empires throughout its history. 

History of operating systems<====>55395<====>History of operating systems  Computer operating systems (OSes) provide a set of functions needed and used by most application programs on a computer, and the links needed to control and synchronize computer hardware.  On the first computers, with no operating system, every program needed the full hardware specification to run correctly and perform standard tasks, and its own drivers for peripheral devices like printers and punched paper card readers.  The growing complexity of hardware and application programs eventually made operating systems a necessity for everyday use. Background The earliest computers were mainframes that lacked any form of operating system. 

Hadean<====>55397<====>Hadean The Hadean ( ) is a geologic eon of the Earth predating the Archean.  It began with the formation of the Earth about 4. 6 billion years ago and ended, as defined by the ICS, 4 billion years ago.The geologist Preston Cloud coined the term in 1972, originally to label the period before the earliest-known rocks on Earth.  W.  Brian Harland later coined an almost synonymous term: the "Priscoan period".  Other, older texts simply refer to the eon as the Pre-Archean.  Etymology "Hadean" (from Hades, the Greek god of the underworld) describes the hellish conditions then prevailing on Earth: the planet had just formed and was still very hot owing to its recent accretion, the abundance of short-lived radioactive elements, and frequent collisions with other Solar System bodies. 

Linguistic description<====>55402<====>Linguistic description   In the study of language, description or descriptive linguistics is the work of objectively analyzing and describing how language is actually used (or how it was used in the past) by a group of people in a speech community. All academic research in linguistics is descriptive; like all other sciences, its aim is to describe the linguistic world as it is, without the bias of preconceived ideas about how it ought to be.   Modern descriptive linguistics is based on a structural approach to language, as exemplified in the work of Leonard Bloomfield and others. 

Banded iron formation<====>55406<====>Banded iron formation Banded iron formations (also known as banded ironstone formations or BIFs) are distinctive units of sedimentary rock that are almost always of Precambrian age. A typical banded iron formation consists of repeated, thin layers (a few millimeters to a few centimeters in thickness) of silver to black iron oxides, either magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) or hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ), alternating with bands of iron-poor shales and cherts, often red in color, of similar thickness, and containing microbands (sub-millimeter) of iron oxides.    Some of the oldest known rock formations, formed over  , include banded iron layers. 

Silenus<====>55407<====>Silenus    In Greek mythology, Silenus ( ; Greek: Σειληνός Seilēnos) was a companion and tutor to the wine god Dionysus.  He is typically older than the satyrs of the Dionysian retinue (thiasos), and sometimes considerably older, in which case he may be referred to as a Papposilenus.  The plural sileni refers to the mythological figure as a type that is sometimes thought to be differentiated from a satyr by having the attributes of a horse rather than a goat, though usage of the two words is not consistent enough to permit a sharp distinction. Evolution of the character The original Silenus resembled a folkloric man of the forest with the ears of a horse and sometimes also the tail and legs of a horse. 

Schenectady, New York<====>55412<====>Schenectady, New York Schenectady   ( ) is a city in Schenectady County, New York, United States, of which it is the county seat.  As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 66,135.  The name "Schenectady" is derived from a Mohawk word skahnéhtati meaning "beyond the pines".    The city was founded on the south side of the Mohawk River by Dutch colonists in the 17th century, many from the Albany area.  They were prohibited from the fur trade by the Albany monopoly, which kept its control after the English takeover in 1664. 

Schenectady County, New York<====>55414<====>Schenectady County, New York  Schenectady County ( ) is a county located in the U. S.  state of New York.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 154,727.The county seat is Schenectady.The name is from a Mohawk language word meaning "on the other side of the pine lands," a term that originally applied to Albany. Schenectady County is part of the Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area, and is located west of the confluence of the Mohawk with the Hudson River.  It included territory on both the north and the south sides of the Mohawk River. 

List of linguists<====>55416<====>List of linguists A linguist in the academic sense is a person who studies natural language (an academic discipline known as linguistics).  Ambiguously, the word is sometimes also used to refer to a polyglot (one who knows several languages), or a grammarian (a scholar of grammar), but these two uses of the word are distinct (and one does not have to be a polyglot in order to be an academic linguist).   The following is a list of linguists in the academic sense.

History of linguistics<====>55419<====>History of linguistics  Linguistics as a study endeavors to describe and explain the human faculty of language. Linguistic study was originally motivated by the correct description of classical liturgical language, notably that of Sanskrit grammar, or by the development of logic and rhetoric in ancient Greece, leading to a grammatical tradition in Hellenism.  Beginning around the 4th century BCE, China also developed its own grammatical traditions.  Traditions of Arabic grammar and Hebrew grammar developed during the Middle Ages, also in a religious context. Modern linguistics began to develop in the 18th century, reaching the "golden age of philology" in the 19th century, with work almost entirely centering around Indo-European studies and leading to a highly elaborate and consistent reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European language. 

Theoretical linguistics<====>55422<====>Theoretical linguistics  Theoretical linguistics is the branch of linguistics which inquires into the nature of language itself and seeks to answer fundamental questions as to what language is; how it works; how universal grammar (UG) as a domain-specific mental organ operates; what are its unique properties; how does language relate to other cognitive processes, etc.  Theoretical linguists are most concerned with constructing models of linguistic knowledge, and ultimately developing a linguistic theory. The fields that are generally considered the core of theoretical linguistics are phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics.  Although phonetics often guides phonology, it is often excluded from the purview of theoretical linguistics, along with sociolinguistics. 

Drive letter assignment<====>55424<====>Drive letter assignment In computer data storage, drive letter assignment is the process of assigning alphabetical identifiers to volumes.  Unlike the concept of UNIX mount points, where volumes are named and located arbitrarily in a single hierarchical namespace, drive letter assignment allows multiple highest-level namespaces.  Drive letter assignment is thus a process of using letters to name the roots of the "forest" representing the file system; each volume holds an independent "tree" (or, for non-hierarchical file systems, an independent list of files). OriginThe concept of drive letters, as used today, presumably  owes its origins to IBM's VM family of operating systems, dating back to CP/CMS in 1967 (and its research predecessor CP-40), by way of Digital Research's (DRI) CP/M. 

Jean-François Champollion<====>55434<====>Jean-François Champollion   Jean-François Champollion (Champollion le jeune; 23 December 1790 4 March 1832) was a French scholar, philologist and orientalist, known primarily as the decipherer of Egyptian hieroglyphs and a founding figure in the field of Egyptology.  A child prodigy in philology, he gave his first public paper on the decipherment of Demotic in 1806, and already as a young man held many posts of honor in scientific circles, and spoke Coptic and Arabic fluently.  During the early 19th-century French culture experienced a period of 'Egyptomania', brought on by Napoleon's discoveries in Egypt during his campaign there (1797–1801) which also brought to light the trilingual Rosetta Stone. 

Wuthering Heights<====>55435<====>Wuthering Heights    Wuthering Heights is Emily Brontë's only novel.  Written between October 1845 and June 1846,  Wuthering Heights was published in 1847 under the pseudonym "Ellis Bell"; Brontë died the following year, aged 30.  Wuthering Heights and Anne Brontë's Agnes Grey were accepted by publisher Thomas Newby before the success of their sister Charlotte's novel, Jane Eyre.  After Emily's death, Charlotte edited the manuscript of Wuthering Heights, and arranged for the edited version to be published as a posthumous second edition in 1850.  Although Wuthering Heights is now widely regarded as a classic of English literature, contemporary reviews for the novel were deeply polarised; it was considered controversial because its depiction of mental and physical cruelty was unusually stark, and it challenged strict Victorian ideals of the day regarding religious hypocrisy, morality, social classes and gender inequality. 

Jane Eyre<====>55438<====>Jane EyreJane Eyre   (originally published as Jane Eyre: An Autobiography) is a novel by English writer Charlotte Brontë.  It was published on 16 October 1847, by Smith, Elder & Co.  of London, England, under the pen name "Currer Bell".  The first American edition was published the following year by Harper & Brothers of New York. Primarily of the Bildungsroman genre, Jane Eyre follows the emotions and experiences of its eponymous heroine, including her growth to adulthood and her love for Mr.  Rochester, the Byronic  master of fictitious Thornfield Hall.

In 1905 she was the first woman to be solely awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, becoming the second female Nobel laureate after Marie Curie's 1903 award,  and the first Austrian laureate. Early lifeSuttner was born on 9 June 1843 at Palais Kinsky in the Obecní dvůr district of Prague.   Her parents were the Austrian Lieutenant general (Feldmarschall-Leutnant) Franz de Paula Josef Graf Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau, recently deceased at the age of 75, and his wife Sophie Wilhelmine von Körner, who was fifty years his junior. 

Peter Greenaway<====>55452<====>Peter Greenaway    Peter Greenaway, CBE (born 5 April 1942 in Newport, Wales) is a British film director, screenwriter, and artist.  His films are noted for the distinct influence of Renaissance and Baroque painting, and Flemish painting in particular.  Common traits in his film are the scenic composition and illumination and the contrasts of costume and nudity, nature and architecture, furniture and people, sexual pleasure and painful death. Early lifeGreenaway was born in Newport, Monmouthshire, Wales,  to a teacher mother and a builder's merchant father.Greenaway's family left South Wales when he was three years old (they had moved there originally to avoid the Blitz) and settled in Chingford, Essex (later to become part of greater London). 

Coptic alphabet<====>55456<====>Coptic alphabet   The Coptic alphabet is the script used for writing the Coptic language.  The repertoire of glyphs is based on the Greek alphabet augmented by letters borrowed from the Egyptian Demotic and is the first alphabetic script used for the Egyptian language.  There are several Coptic alphabets, as the Coptic writing system may vary greatly among the various dialects and subdialects of the Coptic language. History  The Coptic alphabet has a long history, going back to the Hellenistic period, of using the Greek alphabet to transcribe Demotic texts, with the aim of recording the correct pronunciation of Demotic. 

10th millennium BC<====>55457<====>10th millennium BCThe 10th millennium BC marks the beginning of the Mesolithic and Epipaleolithic periods, which is the first part of the Holocene epoch.  Agriculture, based on the cultivation of primitive forms of millet and rice, occurred in Southwest Asia.  Roberts (1994)    Although agriculture was being developed in the Fertile Crescent, it would not be widely practiced for another 2,000 years.  The world population was between one and ten million people,  most of whom were hunter-gatherer communities scattered over all continents except Antarctica and Zealandia.  The Würm glaciation ended, and the beginning interglacial, which endures to this day, allowed the re-settlement of northern regions. 

Princess of Wales<====>55459<====>Princess of Wales Princess of Wales ( ) is a British courtesy title held by the wife of the Prince of Wales, who is, since the 14th century, the heir apparent of the English or British monarch.  The first acknowledged title holder was Eleanor de Montfort, wife of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd.  It has subsequently been used by wives of post-conquest princes of Wales. The title is currently held by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall (the former Camilla Parker Bowles), second wife of Charles, Prince of Wales since their marriage on 9 April 2005.  She does not, however, use the title,  as it has remained strongly associated with the previous holder, the late Diana, Princess of Wales. 

Doñana National Park<====>55460<====>Doñana National Park Doñana National Park is a natural reserve in Andalusia, southern Spain, in the provinces of Huelva (most of its territory), Cádiz and Seville.  It covers   , of which   are a protected area.  The park is an area of marshes, shallow streams, and sand dunes in Las Marismas, the delta where the Guadalquivir River flows into the Atlantic Ocean.  It was established as a nature reserve in 1969 when the World Wildlife Fund joined with the Spanish government and purchased a section of marshes to protect it.   The eco-system has been under constant threat by the draining of the marshes, the use of river water to boost agricultural production by irrigating land along the coast, water pollution by upriver mining, and the expansion of tourist facilities. 

High-occupancy vehicle lane<====>55465<====>High-occupancy vehicle lane A high-occupancy vehicle lane (also known as an HOV lane, carpool lane, diamond lane, 2+ lane, and transit lane or T2 or T3 lanes in Australia and New Zealand) is a restricted traffic lane reserved at peak travel times or longer for the exclusive use of vehicles with a driver and one or more passengers, including carpools, vanpools, and transit buses.  The normal minimum occupancy level is 2 or 3 occupants.  Many jurisdictions exempt other vehicles, including motorcycles, charter buses, emergency and law enforcement vehicles, low-emission and other green vehicles, and/or single-occupancy vehicles paying a toll.

Catch-22<====>55469<====>Catch-22   Catch-22 is a satirical novel by American author Joseph Heller.  He began writing it in 1953; the novel was first published in 1961.  Often cited as one of the most significant novels of the twentieth century,    it uses a distinctive non-chronological third-person omniscient narration, describing events from the points of view of different characters.  The separate storylines are out of sequence so the timeline develops along with the plot. The novel is set during World War II, from 1942 to 1944.  It mainly follows the life of Captain John Yossarian, a U.

The Addams Family<====>55491<====>The Addams Family  The Addams Family is a fictional household created by American cartoonist Charles Addams.  The Addams Family characters have traditionally included Gomez and Morticia Addams, their children Wednesday and Pugsley, close family members Uncle Fester and Grandmama, their butler Lurch, the disembodied hand Thing, and Gomez's Cousin Itt.  The Addamses are a satirical inversion of the ideal twentieth-century American family: an eccentric wealthy aristocratic clan who delight in the macabre and are seemingly unaware, or do not care, that other people find them bizarre or frightening.

Bábism<====>55494<====>Bábism   Bábism  ( , Babiyye), also known as the Bayání Faith   (Arabic:  , Bayání), is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion which professes that there is one incorporeal, unknown, and incomprehensible God  Browne, E. G.  Kitab-i-Nuqtatu'l-Kaf, p.  15  who manifests his will in an unending series of theophanies, called Manifestations of God (Arabic:  ).  It is an extremely small religion, with no more than a few thousand adherents according to current estimates, most of which are concentrated in Iran.It was founded by ‘Ali Muhammad Shirazi who first assumed the title of Báb (  "Gate") from which the religion gets its name, out of the belief that he was the gate to the Twelfth Imam. 

Miller's Crossing<====>55495<====>Miller's Crossing    Miller's Crossing is a 1990 American neo-noir gangster film, with elements of black comedy, written, directed and produced by the Coen brothers, and starring Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden, John Turturro, Jon Polito, J.  E.  Freeman, and Albert Finney.  The plot concerns a power struggle between two rival gangs and how the protagonist, Tom Reagan (Byrne), plays both sides off against each other. In 2005, Time chose Miller's Crossing as one of the 100 greatest films made since the inception of the periodical.  Time critic Richard Corliss called it a "noir with a touch so light, the film seems to float on the breeze like the frisbee of a fedora sailing through the forest".

Elizabeth Gaskell<====>55503<====>Elizabeth Gaskell   Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell, (née Stevenson; 29 September 1810 – 12 November 1865), often referred to as Mrs Gaskell, was an English novelist, biographer, and short story writer.  Her novels offer a detailed portrait of the lives of many strata of Victorian society, including the very poor, and are of interest to social historians as well as lovers of literature.  Her first novel, Mary Barton, was published in 1848.  Gaskell's The Life of Charlotte Brontë, published in 1857, was the first biography of Brontë.  In this biography, she only wrote the moral, sophisticated things in Brontë’s life, the rest she left out, deciding that certain -more salacious aspects- of her life were better kept hidden.

NeWS<====>55519<====>NeWS NeWS (Network extensible Window System) is a discontinued windowing system developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1980s.   Originally known as "SunDew",  its primary authors were James Gosling and David S.  H.  Rosenthal.  The NeWS interpreter was based on PostScript (as was the later Display PostScript, although the two projects were otherwise unrelated) extending it to allow interaction and multiple "contexts" to support windows.  Like PostScript, NeWS could be used as a complete programming language, but unlike PostScript, NeWS could be used to make complete interactive programs with mouse support and a GUI. 

Abdul Nasser<====>55520<====>Abdul NasserAbdul Nasser ( ) is a male Muslim given name, and in modern usage, surname.  It is built from the Arabic words Abd, al- and Nasser.  The name means "servant of the Helper", An-Nasser being a Muslim theophoric name.  The letter a of the al- is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by u.  Because the letter n is a sun letter, the letter l of the al- can be assimilated to it.  Thus although the name is written in Arabic with letters corresponding to Abd al-Nasser, the pronunciation can correspond to Abd an-Nasser.

Liturgical year<====>55525<====>Liturgical year The liturgical year, also known as the church year or Christian year, as well as the kalendar ,  consists of the cycle of liturgical seasons in Christian churches that determines when feast days, including celebrations of saints, are to be observed, and which portions of Scripture are to be read either in an annual cycle or in a cycle of several years. Distinct liturgical colours may appear in connection with different seasons of the liturgical year.  The dates of the festivals vary somewhat between the different churches, though the sequence and logic is largely the same. 

Donkey<====>55526<====>Donkey    The donkey or ass (Equus africanus asinus)   is a domesticated member of the horse family, Equidae.  The wild ancestor of the donkey is the African wild ass, E.  africanus.  The donkey has been used as a working animal for at least 5000 years.  There are more than 40 million donkeys in the world, mostly in underdeveloped countries, where they are used principally as draught or pack animals.  Working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels.  Small numbers of donkeys are kept for breeding or as pets in developed countries. 

Clam<====>55528<====>Clam   Clam is a common name for several kinds of bivalve molluscs.  The word is often applied only to those that live as infauna, spending most of their lives partially buried in the sand of the ocean floor.  In particular, edible infaunal bivalves are often called clams.  Clams have two shells of equal size connected by two adductor muscles and have a powerful burrowing foot.   Clams in the culinary sense do not live attached to a substrate (whereas oysters and mussels do) and do not live near the bottom (whereas scallops do).  In culinary usage, clams are commonly eaten marine bivalves, as in clam digging and the resulting soup, clam chowder. 

Jumper (dress)<====>55529<====>Jumper (dress)A jumper or jumper dress  (in American English), pinafore dress or informally pinafore (British English) is a sleeveless, collarless dress intended to be worn over a blouse, shirt or sweater.In British English, the term jumper describes what is called a sweater in American English.  Also, in more formal British usage, a distinction is made between a pinafore dress and a pinafore.  The latter, though a related garment, has an open back and is worn as an apron.  In American English, pinafore always refers to an apron. A sundress, like a jumper, is sleeveless and collarless; however, such articles are not worn over a blouse or sweater, and are of distinctly different cuts and fashions. 

Personal protective equipment<====>55530<====>Personal protective equipment   Personal protective equipment (PPE) refers to protective clothing, helmets, goggles, or other garments or equipment designed to protect the wearer's body from injury or infection.  The hazards addressed by protective equipment include physical, electrical, heat, chemicals, biohazards, and airborne particulate matter.  Protective equipment may be worn for job-related occupational safety and health purposes, as well as for sports and other  recreational activities.  "Protective clothing" is applied to traditional categories of clothing, and "protective gear" applies to items such as pads, guards, shields, or  masks, and others. The purpose of personal protective equipment is to reduce employee exposure to hazards when engineering controls and administrative controls are not feasible or effective to reduce these risks to acceptable levels. 

Conventional sex<====>55539<====>Conventional sexConventional sex, or vanilla sex, is sexual behavior that is within the range of normality for a culture or subculture, and typically involves sex which does not include elements of BDSM, kink, or fetishism.

Among heterosexual couples in the Western world, for example, conventional sex often refers to sexual intercourse in the missionary position.  It can also describe penetrative sex which does not have any element of BDSM, kink or fetish.

Hawley and was signed into law on June 17, 1930.  The act raised U. S.  tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods.  The tariffs (this does not include duty-free imports – see Tariff levels below) under the act were the second-highest in the U. S.  in 100 years, exceeded by a small margin by the Tariff of 1828.

Tariff<====>55551<====>Tariff    A tariff is a tax on imports or exports between sovereign states.  In other languages and very occasionally   in English, tariff or its cognates may also be used to describe any list of prices (e. g. , electrical tariff).  This article discusses the preceeding meaning. EtymologyThe small Spanish town of Tarifa is sometimes credited with being the origin of the word  "tariff", since it was the first port in history to charge merchants for the use of its docks.   The name "Tarifa" itself is derived from the name of the Berber warrior, Tarif ibn Malik.

Humphrey–Hawkins Full Employment Act<====>55556<====>Humphrey–Hawkins Full Employment Act The Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act  (known informally as the Humphrey–Hawkins Full Employment Act) is an act of legislation by the United States government. Impetus and strategyUnemployment and inflation levels began to rise in the early 1970s, reviving fears of an economic recession.  In the past, the country's economic policy had been defined by the Employment Act of 1946, which encouraged the federal government to pursue "maximum employment, production, and purchasing power" by cooperation with private enterprise.  Some Representatives, dissatisfied with the vague wording of this act, sought to create an amendment that would strengthen and clarify the country's economic policy. 

Timeline<====>55557<====>Timeline    A timeline is a display of a list of events in chronological order.   It is typically a graphic design showing a long bar labelled with dates alongside itself and usually events. Timelines can use any time scale, depending on the subject and data.  Most timelines use a linear scale, in which a unit of distance is equal to a set amount of time.  This time scale is dependent on the events in the timeline.  A timeline of evolution can be over millions of years, whereas a timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks can take place over minutes, and an explosion over milliseconds.

Tariff of 1789<====>55561<====>Tariff of 1789The Tariff Act of 1789, was the first major Act passed in the United States under its present Constitution of 1789 and had two purposes as stated in Section I of the Act which reads as follows;"Whereas it is necessary for that support of government, for the discharge of the debts of the United States, and the encouragement and protection of manufactures, that duties be laid on goods, wares and merchandise:" The Federal legislature, acting under the recently ratified US Constitution, authorized the collection of tariff and tonnage duties to meet the operating costs of the new central government, to provide funds to pay the interest and principal on revolutionary war debts inherited from the Continental Congress. Miller, 1960, p. 15  It also provided a degree of protection. "The protective acts of the states furnished the experience on which the national legislators based their proceedings."  The general range of duties was by no means such as would have been thought protective in later days; but the intention to protect was there.  The debates over the purpose of the tariff exposed the sectional interests at stake: Northern manufacturers favored high duties to protect industry; Southern planters desired a low tariff that would foster cheap consumer imports.  The final bill extracted concessions from both interests, but delivered a distinct advantage to maritime and manufacturing regions of the country.  Malone, 1960, p. 256  Representative James Madison  of Virginia navigated to passage, but was unable to insert provisions that would have discriminated against British imports   and shift the carrying trade to French and American vessels. The Tariff Bill was passed in the House by a vote of 31-19 on July 1, 1789; the resultant enrolled Bill was signed by the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate on July 2, 1789; and President Washington signed the Act in law on July 4, 1789. Economic conditions prior to passageThe American Revolution was followed by an economic reorganization, which carried in its wake a period of uncertainty and hard times. During the conflict, labor and investment had been diverted from agriculture and legitimate trade to manufacturing and privateer. Men had gone into occupations that ceased with the end of the war. Lowered prices, resulting from the cessation of war demands, in combination with the importation of the cheaper goods of Europe, were fast ruining such infant manufacturing concerns as had sprung up during the war, some of which were at a comparative disadvantage with the resumption of normal foreign trading relations. Another factor which made the situation even  more distressing was the British Navigation Acts. The only clause in the treaty of peace (1783) concerning commerce was a stipulation guaranteeing that the navigation of the Mississippi would be forever free to the United States. John Jay had tried to secure some reciprocal trade provisions with Great Britain but without result. Pitt, in 1783, introduced a bill into the British Parliament providing for free trade between the United States and the British colonies, but instead of passing the bill, Parliament enacted the British Navigation Act 1783, which admitted only British-built ships and manned ships to the ports of the West Indies and imposed heavy tonnage dues upon American ships in other British ports. It was amplified in 1786 by another act designed to prevent the fraudulent registration of American vessels and by still another in 1787, which prohibited the importation of American goods by way of foreign islands. The favorable features of the old Navigation Acts that had granted bounties and reserved the English markets in certain cases to colonial products were gone; the unfavorable ones were left. The British market was further curtailed by the depression there after 1783. Although the French treaty of 1778 had promised "perfect equality and reciprocity" in commercial relations, it was found impossible to make a commercial treaty on that basis. Spain demanded, as the price for reciprocal trading relations, a surrender by the United States for 25 years the right of navigating the Mississippi, a price that the New England merchants would have been glad to pay.France (1778) and the Netherlands (1782) made treaties but not on even terms; Portugal refused all advances. Only Sweden (1783) and Prussia (1785) made treaties guaranteeing reciprocal commercial privileges. Harold Underwood Faulkner, American Economic History, Harper & Brothers, 1938, p. 182 The weakness of Congress under the Articles of Confederation prevented retaliation by the central government. Power was repeatedly asked to regulate commerce.but was refused by the states upon which rested the execution of such commercial treaties as Congress might negotiate. Eventually, the states themselves attempted retaliatory measures, and from 1783 to 1788, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia levied tonnage dues upon British vessels or discriminating tariffs upon British goods. Whatever effect these efforts might have had were neutralized by the fact that the duties varied 0% to 100%, which simply drove British ships to the free or cheapest ports to flood the market with their goods. Commercial war between the states followed and turned futility into chaos. Adoption of the Constitution meant the elimination of many of the economic ills under which industry and commerce had struggled since the war. A reorganization was essential and the immediate economic results were salutary. Its most important additions to the power of Congress were those relating to finance and commerce: it enabled the federal government to levy taxes, regulate trade, coin money, protect industry, and direct the settlement of the West, and, as later events proved, to establish credit and redeem its securities. Under it, freedom of trade was insured throughout the young republic. In the months leading up to the passage of the Tariff Act, Congress received several petitions from different cities representing manufacturing groups asking for relief from the flood of European imported goods.The United States Congress answered the petitions of these groups for urgent attention, by making the Tariff of 1789 the first major bill to be considered in its first session and passed.Import duty legislation and American sectional interestsThe import fees "represented a compromise between the advocates of a high protective tariff and those who favored a tariff for revenue only [to maintain the central government]."  Charges up to fifty percent were imposed on selected manufactured and agricultural goods, including "steel, ships, cordage, tobacco, salt, indigo [and] cloth." On the majority of items subject to duty, a five percent fee was levied, ad valorem  Molasses, an indispensable ingredient for Northeastern rum producers, was lowered from 6¢ per gallon to 2.5¢.  Madison modified the terms of the tariff to balance sectional conflicts  but conceded that articles subject to high duties "were pretty generally taxed for the benefit of the manufacturing part of the northern community." Miller, 1960, p. 16  He acknowledged the South, the main wealth-producing part of the nation, would inevitably "shoulder a disproportionate share of the financial burden involved in the transforming the United States into a commercial, manufacturing, and maritime power." Miller, 1960, p. 18 Tonnage duty legislation and US foreign relationsIn its final form, the tariff erected "an American navigation system," superseding the individual state sanctioned fees designed to protect domestic shipping during the Articles of Confederation period from 1781 to 1789.   The act established tonnage rates favorable to American carriers by charging them lower cargo fees than those imposed on foreign boats importing similar goods. Coastal trade was reserved exclusively for American flag vessels.  These provisions were consistent with mercantilist policies practice by European powers at the time.  Dating from the Treaty of Paris, ending the War for Independence in 1783, Great Britain had declined to seek a commercial treaty with the United States.  In addition, provisions of the treaty had gone unfulfilled, including compensation to slaveholders for slaves emancipated by the British Navy during the War and the failure to abandon military posts in the Northwest Territory]].   Still, Great Britain remained the dominant trading partner for the United States, the countries reverting to an essentially colonial-era trade relationship.   Representative James Madison, presiding over the tariff debates in Congress, attempted to introduce discriminatory provisions into the tonnage legislation that would favor France and its colonial possessions and shift American trade away from Great Britain.  To effect this, Madison called for a 60¢ per ton fee upon foreign carriers lacking a commercial agreement with the United States, while France, which possessed a treaty, would be charged tonnage at 30¢. This measure alone "was equivalent to levying economic war" upon Great Britain.  Madison's proposals were intended to unify politically the agricultural and manufacturing interests in support of that commercial realignment at the national level, damaging to Great Britain and beneficial to revolutionary France.  Many representatives of northern business were wary of abandoning Great Britain as their primary trading partner and merchant marine and questioned whether France could ever act "as the principle supplier and market for the United States."   The House of Representatives, nevertheless, initially passed Madison’s "controversial" legislation,  with the discriminatory provision intact. The Senate, however, removed it from the bill and sent it back to the House, where it was passed, without amendment, 31 to 19, on July 4, 1789. Miller, 1960, p. 19  The Tariff of 1789 placed France and Great Britain on an equal footing with regard to shipping, manufactures, and raw products delivered to American ports. All foreign-owned or foreign-built ships paid 50¢ per ton duty; American-owned vessels were charged 6¢ per ton. Political and sectional responses to the tariffMadison’s attempt to enlist northern merchants and businessmen in supporting an economic contest with Great Britain elicited a cool response. Miller, 1960, p. 18, p. 19  Firstly, British capital and markets contributed to the general prosperity of the North, and secondly, a shift towards France would mean aligning the United States with a revolutionary government that exhibited what Federalist leadership regarded as "an excess of democracy."  Miller, 1960, p. 100  Alexander Hamilton, soon to enter the executive branch as Secretary of the Treasury, declined to support Madison’s proposal and warned that economic warfare with Great Britain would drastically reduce the import duty revenue that the tariff legislation called for, placing at risk the funds anticipated to run the new federal government and finance the national debt. This dispute between Madison and Hamilton marked "the first important breach" between these two Federalist leaders,  which would deepen when Hamilton, as Treasury Secretary, launched his fiscal and economic programs, ending their long collaboration.  The legislation produced the first sectional strains within "the Federalist coalition of northern businessmen and southern planters."  In the South, "agricultural interests" viewed the high tariff and tonnage rates as a triumph for northern merchants and manufacturers, the burden of which fell on southern staple crop exporters. This early application of Constitutional authority highlighted north-south social and economic differences and presaged the dissolution of the Federalist coalition, the formation of an agrarian alliance,   and the rise of the First Party System.

National Road<====>55562<====>National Road   The National Road (also known as the Cumberland Road)    was the first major improved highway in the United States built by the federal government.  Built between 1811 and 1837, the   road connected the Potomac and Ohio Rivers and was a main transport path to the West for thousands of settlers.  When rebuilt in the 1830s, it became the second U. S.  road surfaced with the macadam process pioneered by Scotsman John Loudon McAdam.    Construction began heading west in 1811 at Cumberland, Maryland, on the Potomac River. 

Embargo Act of 1807<====>55564<====>Embargo Act of 1807   The Embargo Act of 1807 was a general embargo enacted by the United States Congress against Great Britain and France during the Napoleonic Wars. The embargo was imposed in response to violations of the United States neutrality, in which American merchantmen and their cargo were seized as contraband of war by the belligerent European navies.  The British Royal Navy, in particular, resorted to impressment, forcing thousands of American seamen into service on their warships.  Britain and France, engaged in the Napoleonic Wars, rationalized the plunder of U. S.  shipping as incidental to war and necessary for their survival. 

Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves<====>55565<====>Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves  The Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves of 1807 ( , enacted March 2, 1807) is a United States federal law that stated that no new slaves were permitted to be imported into the United States.  It took effect in 1808, the earliest date permitted by the United States Constitution. This legislation was promoted by President Thomas Jefferson, who called for its enactment in his 1806 State of the Union Address.    He had promoted the idea since the 1770s.  It reflected the force of the general trend toward abolishing the international slave trade, which Virginia followed by all the other  states had prohibited or restricted since then. 

Non-Intercourse Act (1809)<====>55566<====>Non-Intercourse Act (1809)   In the last sixteen days of President Thomas Jefferson's presidency, the Congress replaced the Embargo Act of 1807 with the almost unenforceable Non-Intercourse Act of March 1809.  This Act lifted all embargoes on American shipping except for those bound for British or French ports.  Its intent was to damage the economies of the United Kingdom and France.  Like its predecessor, the Embargo Act, it was mostly ineffective, and contributed to the coming of the War of 1812.  In addition, it seriously damaged the economy of the United States.   The Non-Intercourse Act was followed by Macon's Bill Number 2. 

Macon's Bill Number 2<====>55567<====>Macon's Bill Number 2  Macon's Bill Number 2,  which became law in the United States on May 14, 1810, was intended to motivate Great Britain and France to stop seizing American vessels during the Napoleonic Wars.  This bill was a revision of the original bill by Representative Nathaniel Macon, known as Macon's Bill Number 1.  Macon neither wrote it nor approved it.   The law lifted all embargoes with Britain and France (for three months).  It stated that if either one of the two countries ceased attacks upon American shipping, the United States would end trade with the other, unless that other country agreed to recognize the rights of the neutral American ships as well. 

Second Bank of the United States<====>55568<====>Second Bank of the United States  The Second Bank of the United States, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was the second federally authorized Hamiltonian national bank  in the United States during its 20-year charter from February 1816  to January 1836.  Hammond, 1947, p.  155  The bank's formal name, according to section 9 of its charter as passed by Congress, was "The President, Directors, and Company, of the Bank of the United States. " A private corporation with public duties, the bank handled all fiscal transactions for the U. S.  Government, and was accountable to Congress and the U. 

First Bank of the United States<====>55569<====>First Bank of the United States  The President, Directors and Company, of the Bank of the United States, commonly known as the First Bank of the United States, was a national bank, chartered for a term of twenty years, by the United States Congress on February 25, 1791.  It followed the Bank of North America, the nation's first de facto central bank. Establishment of the Bank of the United States was part of a three-part expansion of federal fiscal and monetary power, along with a federal mint and excise taxes, championed by Alexander Hamilton, first Secretary of the Treasury. 

Bank of North America<====>55570<====>Bank of North America The President, Directors, and Company, of the Bank of North America, commonly known as the Bank of North America, was a private bank first adopted on May 26, 1781 by the Confederation Congress , chartered on December 31, 1781  , and opened in Philadelphia on January 7, 1782. It was based upon a plan presented by US Superintendent of Finance Robert Morris on May 17, 1781   that created the Nation's first de facto central bank.   When shares in the bank were sold to the public, the Bank of North America became the country's first initial public offering. 

Tariff of Abominations<====>55572<====>Tariff of Abominations The "Tariff of Abominations" was a protective tariff passed by the Congress of the United States on May 19, 1828, designed to protect industry in the northern United States.  Enacted during the presidency of John Quincy Adams, it was labeled the Tariff of Abominations by its southern detractors because of the effects it had on the antebellum Southern economy.  It set a 38% tax on 92% of all imported goods. Industries in the northern United States were being driven out of business by low-priced imported goods; the major goal of the tariff was to protect these industries by taxing those goods. 

Force Bill<====>55573<====>Force Bill The United States Force Bill, formally titled "An Act further to provide for the collection of duties on imports",    (1833), refers to legislation enacted by the 22nd U. S.  Congress on March 2, 1833, during the Nullification Crisis. Passed by Congress at the urging of President Andrew Jackson, the Force Bill consisted of eight sections expanding presidential power and was designed to compel the state of South Carolina's compliance with a series of federal tariffs, opposed by John C.  Calhoun and other leading South Carolinians.  Among other things, the legislation stipulated that the president could, if he deemed it necessary, deploy the U. 

Gag rule<====>55574<====>Gag ruleA gag rule is a rule that limits or forbids the raising, consideration, or discussion of a particular topic by members of a legislative or decision-making body. ExamplesMalaysiaA present-day example can be found in the Dewan Negara (Senate) of Malaysia, which has a standing order prohibiting any member from proposing the repeal of those articles of the Malaysian Constitution that reserve certain privileges for Bumiputra (such as ethnic Malay) citizens. EnglandA gag rule may be formally neutral, that is, forbidding discussions or arguments either for or against a particular policy.  For example, William Laud, the Archbishop of Canterbury during the reign of King Charles I of England: forbade ministers to discuss the sublime mysteries associated with Calvin's doctrine of predestination. 

Specie Circular<====>55575<====>Specie CircularThe Specie Circular is a United States presidential executive order issued by President Andrew Jackson in 1836 pursuant to the Coinage Act and carried out by his successor, President Martin Van Buren.   It required payment for government land to be in gold and silver.  HistoryThe Act was a reaction to the growing concerns about excessive speculations of land after the Indian removal, which was mostly done with soft currency.   The sale of public lands increased five times between 1834 and 1836.   Speculators paid for these purchases with depreciating paper money. While government law already demanded that land purchases be completed with specie or paper notes from specie-backed banks, a large portion of buyers used paper money from state banks not backed by hard money. 

Wilmot Proviso<====>55576<====>Wilmot Proviso The Wilmot Proviso proposed an American law to ban slavery in territory acquired from Mexico in the Mexican War.The conflict over the Wilmot proviso was one of the major events leading to the American Civil War. Congressman David Wilmot first introduced the proviso in the United States House of Representatives on August 8, 1846, as a rider on a $2,000,000 appropriations bill intended for the final negotiations to resolve the Mexican–American War (this was only three months into the two-year war).  It passed the House but failed in the Senate, where the South had greater representation. 

Full employment<====>55578<====>Full employmentFull employment means that everyone who wants a job have all the hours of work they need on "fair wages".   Because people switch jobs, full employment means a stable rate of unemployment around 1 to 2 per cent of the total workforce, but does not allow for underemployment where part-time workers cannot find hours they need for a decent living.   In macroeconomics, full employment is sometimes defined as the level of employment at which there is no cyclical or deficient-demand unemployment.   Some economists reject that full employment is a worthwhile goal, and see it as a necessary means to control inflation, i. 

MAD (programming language)<====>55579<====>MAD (programming language) MAD (Michigan Algorithm Decoder) is a programming language and compiler for the IBM 704 and later the IBM 709, IBM 7090, IBM 7040, UNIVAC 1107, UNIVAC 1108, Philco 210-211, and eventually the IBM S/370 mainframe computers.  Developed in 1959 at the University of Michigan by Bernard Galler, Bruce Arden and Robert M.  Graham, MAD is a variant of the ALGOL language.  It was widely used to teach programming at colleges and universities during the 1960s and played a minor role in the development of CTSS, Multics, and the Michigan Terminal System computer operating systems. 

Gout<====>55584<====>GoutGout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of a red, tender, hot, and swollen joint.Pain typically comes on rapidly in less than twelve hours.   The joint at the base of the big toe is affected in about half of cases.It may also result in tophi, kidney stones, or urate nephropathy.   Gout is due to elevated levels of uric acid in the blood.   This occurs due to a combination of diet and genetic factors.   At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons, and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. 

Walker tariff<====>55585<====>Walker tariffThe Walker Tariff was a set of tariff rates adopted by the United States in 1846.  The Walker Tariff was enacted by the Democrats, and made substantial cuts in the high rates of the "Black Tariff" of 1842, enacted by the Whigs.  It was based on a report by Secretary of the Treasury Robert J.  Walker.  The Walker Tariff reduced tariff rates from 32% to 25%; it coincided with Britain's repeal of the Corn Laws and led to an increase in trade.  It was one of the lowest tariffs in American history. AdoptionDemocrat James K. 

Seneca Falls Convention<====>55586<====>Seneca Falls Convention The Seneca Falls Convention was the first women's rights convention.  Dumenil, 2012, p.  56.  Many scholarly sources describe Seneca Falls as "the first women's rights convention", including Wellman, 2004 (the book's title itself include those words); Isenberg, 1998, p.  1; and McMillen, 2008, p.  115, and no scholarly source describes an earlier meeting as  "women's rights convention".  Seneca Falls is given that recognition because it was the first that was organized by women explicitly for the purpose of discussing women's rights as such.  It was not, however, the first convention at which the topic of women's rights was among the topics that were discussed. 

Morrill Tariff<====>55588<====>Morrill TariffThe Morrill Tariff of 1861 was an increased import tariff in the United States, adopted on March 2, 1861, during the administration of President James Buchanan, a Democrat.    It was the twelfth of seventeen planks in the platform of the incoming Republican Party, which had not yet been inaugurated, and it appealed to industrialists and factory workers as a way to foster rapid industrial growth.  It was named for its sponsor, Representative Justin Smith Morrill of Vermont, who drafted it with the advice of Pennsylvania economist Henry Charles Carey.  The passage of the tariff was possible because many tariff-averse Southerners had resigned from Congress after their states declared their secession. 

Homestead Acts<====>55589<====>Homestead Acts  The Homestead Acts were several United States federal laws that gave an applicant ownership of land, typically called a "homestead," at no cost.   In all, more than 270 million acres of public land, or nearly 10% of the total area of the U. S. , was given away free to 1. 6 million homesteaders; most of the homesteads were west of the Mississippi River. An extension of the Homestead Principle in law, the Homestead Acts were an expression of the "Free Soil" policy of Northerners who wanted individual farmers to own and operate their own farms, as opposed to Southern slave-owners who wanted to buy up large tracts of land and use slave labor, thereby shutting out free white men. 

Bob Black<====>55592<====>Bob Black   Robert Charles "Bob" Black Jr.  (born January 4, 1951) is an American anarchist.  He is the author of the books  The Abolition of Work and Other Essays, Beneath the Underground, Friendly Fire, Anarchy After Leftism, Defacing the Currency, and numerous political essays. BiographyBlack graduated from the University of Michigan and Georgetown Law School.   He later took M. A.  degrees in jurisprudence and social policy from the University of California (Berkeley), criminal justice from the State University of New York (SUNY) at Albany, and an LL. M in criminal law from the SUNY Buffalo School of Law. 

Morrill Land-Grant Acts<====>55593<====>Morrill Land-Grant Acts  The Morrill Land-Grant Acts are United States statutes that allowed for the creation of land-grant colleges in U. S.  states using the proceeds of federal land sales.  The Morrill Act of 1862 (  et seq. ) was enacted during the American Civil War and the Morrill Act of 1890 (the Agricultural College Act of 1890 ( ,   et seq. )) expanded this model. Passage of original billFor 20 years prior to the first introduction of the bill in 1857, there was a political movement calling for the creation of agriculture colleges. 

Wade–Davis Bill<====>55595<====>Wade–Davis BillThe Wade–Davis Bill of 1864 was a bill proposed for the Reconstruction of the South  written by two Radical Republicans, Senator Benjamin Wade of Ohio and  Representative Henry Winter Davis of Maryland.  In contrast to President Abraham Lincoln's more lenient Ten Percent Plan, the bill made re-admittance to the Union for former Confederate states contingent on a majority in each Southern state to take the Ironclad oath to the effect they had never in the past supported the Confederacy.  The bill passed both houses of Congress on July 2, 1864, but was pocket vetoed by Lincoln and never took effect. 

National Bank Act<====>55596<====>National Bank ActThe National Banking Acts of 1863 and 1864 were two United States federal banking acts that established a system of national banks, and created the United States National Banking System.  They encouraged development of a national currency backed by bank holdings of U. S.  Treasury securities and established the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as part of the United States Department of the Treasury and a system of nationally chartered banks.  The Act shaped today's national banking system and its support of a uniform U. S.  banking policy. BackgroundAfter the expiration of the Second Bank of the United States in 1836, the control of banking regimes devolved mostly to the states. 

Sleepy Hollow (film)<====>55601<====>Sleepy Hollow (film)  Sleepy Hollow is a 1999 American Gothic supernatural horror film  directed by Tim Burton.  It is a film adaptation loosely inspired by the 1820 short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" by Washington Irving and stars Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci, with Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, and Jeffrey Jones in supporting roles.  The plot follows police constable Ichabod Crane (Depp) sent from New York City to investigate a series of murders in the village of Sleepy Hollow by a mysterious Headless Horseman. Development began in 1993 at Paramount Pictures with Kevin Yagher originally set to direct Andrew Kevin Walker's script as a low-budget slasher film. 

Peanut<====>55602<====>PeanutThe peanut, also known as the groundnut and the goober  and taxonomically classified as Arachis hypogaea,  is a legume crop grown mainly for its edible seeds.  It is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics, being important to both small and large commercial producers.  It is classified as both a grain legume  and, because of its high oil content, an oil crop.   World annual production of shelled peanuts was 42 million tonnes in 2014.  Atypically among crop plants, peanut pods develop underground rather than aboveground.  It is this characteristic that the botanist Linnaeus used to assign the specific name hypogaea, which means "under the earth. 

Haifa<====>55606<====>Haifa    Haifa (;    )  is the third-largest city in the State of Israel after Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, with a population of   in  .  The city of Haifa forms part of the Haifa metropolitan area, the second- or third-most populous metropolitan area in Israel.   It is also home to the Bahá'í World Centre, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a destination for Bahá'í pilgrims.    Built on the slopes of Mount Carmel, the settlement has a history spanning more than 3,000 years. 

Discriminant<====>55607<====>Discriminant  In algebra, the discriminant of a polynomial is a polynomial function of its coefficients, which allows deducing some properties of the roots without computing them.  For example, the discriminant of the quadratic polynomial ax^2+bx+c is  b^2-4ac, which is zero if and only if the polynomial has a double root, and (in the case of real coefficients) is positive if and only if the polynomial has two real roots. More generally, for a polynomial of an arbitrary degree, the discriminant is zero if and only if it has a multiple root, and, in the case of real coefficients, it is positive if and only if the number of non-real roots is a multiple of 4 when the degree is 4 or higher. 

Gwen Verdon<====>55608<====>Gwen Verdon Gwyneth Evelyn “Gwen” Verdon (January 13, 1925 – October 18, 2000) was an American actress and dancer.   She won four Tony awards for her musical comedy performances and served as uncredited choreographers assistant and specialty dance coach for both theater and film.  With flaming red hair and a quaver in her voice, Verdon was a critically acclaimed performer on Broadway in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970's.  Having originated many roles in musicals she is also strongly identified with her second husband, director–choreographer Bob Fosse, remembered as the dancer–collaborator–muse for whom he choreographed much of his work and as the guardian of his legacy after his death. 

Interior (topology)<====>55610<====>Interior (topology)In mathematics, specifically in topology, the interior of a subset S of points of a topological space X consists of all points of S that do not belong to the boundary of S.   A point that is in the interior of S is an interior point of S.   The interior of S is the complement of the closure of the complement of S.   In this sense interior and closure are dual notions.    The exterior of a set is the interior of its complement, equivalently the complement of its closure; it consists of the points that are in neither the set nor its boundary. 

Alexandroff extension<====>55611<====>Alexandroff extensionIn the mathematical field of topology, the Alexandroff extension is a way to extend a noncompact topological space by adjoining a single point in such a way that the resulting space is compact.   It is named for the Russian mathematician Pavel Alexandrov. More precisely, let X be a topological space.   Then the Alexandroff extension of X is a certain compact space X* together with an open embedding c : X → X* such that the complement of X in X* consists of a single point, typically denoted ∞.   The map c is a Hausdorff compactification if and only if X is a locally compact, noncompact Hausdorff space. 

Nurse uniform<====>55614<====>Nurse uniform A nurse uniform is attire worn by nurses for hygiene and identification.  The traditional nurse uniform consists of a dress, apron and cap.  It has existed in many variants, but the basic style has remained recognizable. HistoryThe first nurse uniforms were derived from the nun's habit.  Before the 19th century, nuns took care of sick and injured people so it was obvious that trained lay nurses might copy the nun's habit as they have adopted ranks like "Sister".  One of Florence Nightingale's first students (Miss van Rensselaer) designed the original uniform for the students at Miss Nightingale's school of nursing. 

School uniform<====>55615<====>School uniform  A school uniform is a uniform worn by students primarily for a school or otherwise educational institution.  They are common in primary and secondary schools in various countries.  Although often used interchangeably, there is an important distinction between  dress codes and school uniforms: according to scholars such as Nathan Joseph, clothing can only be considered a uniform when it "(a) serves as a group emblem, (b) certifies an institution's legitimacy by revealing individual’s relative positions and (c) suppresses individuality. "  An example of a uniform would be requiring white button-downs and ties for boys and pleated skirts for girls, with both wearing blazers. 

Catiline Orations<====>55620<====>Catiline Orations   The Catiline or Catilinarian Orations is a set of speeches to the Roman Senate given in 63 BC by Marcus Tullius Cicero, one of the year's consuls, accusing Lucius Sergius Catilina (Catiline) of leading a plot to overthrow the Roman government.   Some modern historians, and ancient sources such as Sallust, suggest that Catiline was a more complex and sympathetic character than Cicero's writings declare, and that Cicero, a career politician, was heavily influenced by a desire to establish decisively a lasting reputation as a great Roman patriot and statesman.   Most accounts of the events come from Cicero himself. 

Cotyledon<====>55623<====>Cotyledon   A cotyledon ( ; "seed leaf" from Latin cotyledon,  from Greek: κοτυληδών kotylēdōn, gen. : κοτυληδόνος kotylēdonos, from κοτύλη kotýlē "cup, bowl") is a significant part of the embryo within the seed of a plant, and is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as "The primary leaf in the embryo of the higher plants (Phanerogams); the seed-leaf. "  Upon germination, the cotyledon may become the embryonic first leaves of a seedling.  The number of cotyledons present is one characteristic used by botanists to classify the flowering plants (angiosperms).  Species with one cotyledon are called monocotyledonous ("monocots"). 

Monocotyledon<====>55625<====>Monocotyledon Monocotyledons (    ), commonly referred to as monocots, (Lilianae sensu Chase & Reveal) are flowering plants (angiosperms) whose seeds typically contain only one embryonic leaf, or cotyledon.  They constitute one of the major groups into which the flowering plants have traditionally been divided, the rest of the flowering plants having two cotyledons and therefore classified as dicotyledons, or dicots.  However, molecular phylogenetic research has shown that while the monocots form a monophyletic group or clade (comprising all the descendants of a common ancestor), the dicots do not.  Monocots have almost always been recognized as a group, but with various taxonomic ranks and under several different names. 

Linear combination<====>55632<====>Linear combinationIn mathematics, a linear combination is an expression constructed from a set of terms by multiplying each term by a constant and adding the results (e. g.  a linear combination of x and y would be any expression of the form ax + by, where a and b are constants).The concept of linear combinations is central to linear algebra and related fields of mathematics. Most of this article deals with linear combinations in the context of a vector space over a field, with some generalizations given at the end of the article. DefinitionSuppose that K is a field (for example, the real numbers) and V is a vector space over K. 

Region<====>55633<====>Region In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography).  Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law. Apart from the global continental regions, there are also hydrospheric and atmospheric regions that cover the oceans, and discrete climates above the land and water masses of the planet.  The land and water global regions are divided into subregions geographically bounded by large geological features that influence large-scale ecologies, such as plains and features.

Pope Sabinian<====>55641<====>Pope Sabinian Pope Sabinian ( , d.  22 February 606) was Pope from 13 September 604 to his death in 606, during the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) domination of the Papacy; he was the fourth former apocrisiarius to Constantinople to be elected pope. BiographySabinian was born at Blera (Bieda) near Viterbo.  He had been sent by Pope Gregory I as Apostolic nuncio, to Constantinople, but he apparently was not entirely satisfactory in that office.  He returned to Rome in 597.He was probably consecrated pope on 13 September 604.  The erudite Italian Augustinian Onofrio Panvinio (1529–1568), in his Epitome pontificum Romanorum (Venice, 1557), attributes to him the introduction of the custom of ringing bells at the canonical hours and the celebration of the Eucharist.

Sun Quan<====>55654<====>Sun Quan   Sun Quan (182–252),  courtesy name Zhongmou, formally known as Emperor Da of Wu (literally "Great Emperor of Wu"), was the founder of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period.  He inherited control of the warlord regime established by his elder brother, Sun Ce, in 200.  He declared formal independence and ruled from 222 to 229 as the King of Wu and from 229 to 252 as the Emperor of Wu.  Unlike his rivals Cao Cao and Liu Bei, Sun Quan governed his state mostly separate of politics and ideology, he is sometimes portrayed as neutral considering he accommodated the wills of both his rivals but only when it benefited Eastern Wu and never fully attempted to conquer his rivals, although most of historians would cite his lack of logistical resources to do so.

The law was enacted on March 3, 1867, over the veto of President Andrew Johnson.  It purported to deny the president the power to remove any executive officer who had been appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate, unless the Senate approved the removal during the next full session of Congress.

Specie Payment Resumption Act<====>55658<====>Specie Payment Resumption Act The Specie Payment Resumption Act of January 14, 1875 was a law in the United States that restored the nation to the gold standard through the redemption of previously-unbacked United States Notes and reversed inflationary government policies promoted directly after the American Civil War.  The decision further contracted the nation's money supply and was seen by critics as an exacerbating factor of the so-called Long Depression, which struck in 1873. HistoryLate in 1861, seeking to raise revenue for the American Civil War effort without exhausting its reserves of gold and silver, the United States federal government suspended specie payments, or the payments made in gold and silver in redemption of currency notes. 

Bland–Allison Act<====>55659<====>Bland–Allison Act The Bland–Allison Act, also referred to as the Grand Bland Plan of 1878, was an act of United States Congress requiring the U. S.  Treasury to buy a certain amount of silver and put it into circulation as silver dollars.  Though the bill was vetoed by President Rutherford B.  Hayes, the Congress overrode Hayes' veto on February 28, 1878 to enact the law.  BackgroundThe five-year depression following the Panic of 1873 caused cheap-money advocates (led by Representative Richard P.  Bland, a Democrat of Missouri), to join with silver-producing interests in urging a return to bimetallism, the use of both silver and gold as a standard.

The kingdom had been elective (although the eldest son or brother of the previous king was usually elected) until 1660, when it became hereditary and absolutist. Until 1864 Denmark was also united in a personal union with the duchies of Holstein and Saxe-Lauenburg, and in a political and personal union with the Duchy of Schleswig.Semi-legendary Danish monarchs Chochilaicus—see Hugleik and Hygelac—  515 AD, First Danish King mentioned by Gregory of Tours (538–594).    Hugleik, according to the written sources suffered a defeat in 515 during a naval expedition to the Frankish Empire. Hugleik is the first Danish king mentioned in European sources. Ongendus (Angantyr):   Saint Willibrord wrote about when he visited the Danes, at the time ruled by Ongendus. Harald, named as former king in relating 9th century events, perhaps model for legendary Harald Wartooth. Related to the Frisian king Redbad II who in 754 had to flee to "the land of the Danes" where king Harald reigned ("Daniae Regi Heraldi"). Sigfred: 770s–790sGudfred: 804–810 mentioned as Danish king in the Treaty of Heiligen 811. Hemming: 810–811/812 The Treaty of Heiligen was signed in 811 between the Danish King Hemming and Charlemagne. Sigfred, nephew of Gudfred, and Anulo (Anlaufr), nephew of Harald, fought for throne and both were killed, perhaps model for legendary Sigurd Hring:  Harald Klak and his brothers Ragnfrid and Hemming Halfdansson: 812–813 and again from 819/827. From 826 he and his household lived in exile with the Frankish emperor Louis the Pious, he was baptized by the bishop of Mainz in Ingelheim am Rhein. The last reference of Harald in the written sources are in the Annals of Fulda this records his execution for treason in 852. Sons of Gudfred: 814–820sHorik I: (814) 827–854. king of the Danes (at first ruling jointly with his unnamed brothers). The Frankish annals mention Horik on numerous occasions during the next couple of decades. Horik II: 854–860s. He is believed to have been the immediate successor of Horik I, but the annals are silent about the name of the Danish king for a few years after the disaster of 854.  In 857, Horik II allowed Rorik to occupy the part of the kingdom between the sea and the Eider. Horik II was still alive in 864, when a letter was addressed to him by Pope Nicholas I. Late 9th century kingsBagsecg:  Halfdan: 871–877Sigfred:   It is generally assumed that he was the immediate successor of Horik II, although that is not certain.  His year of succession is unknown, but it was between 864 (when Horik II was still king) and his first appearance as king in the Frankish annals in 873. Sigifrid was baptized in 882. Gudfred: 880sHeiligo (Halga): 890s (?), described by Adam of Bremen as the immediate predecessor of the House of Olof.The "House of Olaf": late 9th century and early 10th century. This dynasty is described by Adam of Bremen, and members of this dynasty are commemorated by the two Sigtrygg Runestones, which represent contemporary evidence that the House of Olaf controlled at least part of Denmark. Olof the Brash, said by Adam to have been a Swede who defeated Heiligo and took the crown.Gyrd and Gnupa, sons and joint successors of Olof, according to Adam. Gnupa is named by Widukind of Corvey as leader of the Danes in 934, and appears on the Sigtrygg Runestones.Sigtrygg, son of Gnupa, memorialized on the Sigtrygg Runestones, presumably dating from shortly after 934.Ragnar Lodbrok, a legendary king probably in the 9th century, only appears in sagas and late histories, and these accounts are wildly inconsistent. He may be a composite character, a chimera of several historical kings and Vikings.Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye (da: Sigurd Orm-i-øje or Snogeøje). Mentioned by late Chronicon Roskildense and Ragnarssona þáttr. Said to be king of Zealand and Scania, and son of Ragnar Lodbrok. He may be inspired by late 9th century king Sigfred (above).Harthacnut (Hardeknud). According to the sagas he is son of Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, but some historians identify him with Adam's Hardegon, Svein's son, who invaded Denmark from Northmannia and supplanted the House of Olof. He may have ruled only part of Denmark, as Adam places the commencement of his long reign between 909 and 915, while the House of Olof was still ruling at least part of Denmark as late as 934.

Hans Janmaat<====>55662<====>Hans Janmaat Johannes Gerardus Hendrikus "Hans" Janmaat (November 3, 1934 – June 9, 2002) was a Dutch politician of the Centre Party (CP) and later his own formed Centre Democrats (CD).  He was Parliamentary leader of the Centre Party in the House of Representatives from September 16, 1982 until October 15, 1984 when he was expelled from the party.  He later served as Parliamentary leader of the Centre Democrats in the House of Representatives from September 8, 1989 until May 19, 1998 when his party lost all its seats. Although he was widely known, he was never a major force in the Dutch political landscape,    partly because of a cordon sanitaire imposed by the Third Lubbers cabinet. 

Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act<====>55663<====>Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act (ch.  27,  ) is a United States federal law, enacted in 1883, which established that positions within the federal government should be awarded on the basis of merit instead of political affiliation.The act provided selection of government employees by competitive exams,  rather than ties to politicians or political affiliation.   It also made it illegal to fire or demote government officials for political reasons and prohibited soliciting campaign donations on Federal government property.    To enforce the merit system and the judicial system, the law also created the United States Civil Service Commission. 

Millicent Fawcett<====>55664<====>Millicent Fawcett   Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett,   (11 June 1847 – 5 August 1929) was a British feminist, intellectual, political and union leader, and writer.  She is primarily known for her work as a campaigner for women to have the vote. As a suffragist (as opposed to a suffragette), she took a moderate line, but was a tireless campaigner.  She concentrated much of her energy on the struggle to improve women's opportunities for higher education and in 1875 co-founded Newnham College, Cambridge.  Janet Howarth, ‘Fawcett, Dame Millicent Garrett (1847–1929)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2007 accessed 4 Jan 2017  She later became president of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (the NUWSS), a position she held from 1897 until 1919. 

Spoils system<====>55667<====>Spoils systemIn politics and government, a spoils system (also known as a patronage system) is a practice in which a political party, after winning an election, gives government civil service jobs to its supporters, friends and relatives as a reward for working toward victory, and as an incentive to keep working for the party—as opposed to a merit system, where offices are awarded on the basis of some measure of merit, independent of political activity. The term was used particularly in politics of the United States, where the federal government operated on a spoils system until the Pendleton Act was passed in 1883 due to a civil service reform movement. 

Chinese Exclusion Act<====>55668<====>Chinese Exclusion Act   The Chinese Exclusion Act was a United States federal law signed by President Chester A.  Arthur on May 6, 1882, prohibiting all immigration of Chinese laborers.  The act followed the Angell Treaty of 1880, a set of revisions to the US–China Burlingame Treaty of 1868 that allowed the US to suspend Chinese immigration.  The act was initially intended to last for 10 years, but was renewed in 1892 with the Geary Act and made permanent in 1902.  The Chinese Exclusion Act was the first law implemented to prevent a specific ethnic group from immigrating to the United States. 

Warsaw Convention<====>55670<====>Warsaw Convention   The Convention for the Unification of certain rules relating to international carriage by air, commonly known as the Warsaw Convention, is an international convention which regulates liability for international carriage of persons, luggage, or goods performed by aircraft for reward. Originally signed in 1929 in Warsaw (hence the name), it was amended in 1955 at The Hague, Netherlands, and in 1971 in Guatemala City, Guatemala.United States courts have held that, at least for some purposes, the Warsaw Convention is a different instrument from the Warsaw Convention as amended by the Hague Protocol. 

Connotation<====>55671<====>Connotation   A connotation is a commonly understood cultural or emotional association that some word or phrase carries, in addition to its explicit or literal meaning, which is its denotation. A connotation is frequently described as either positive or negative, with regard to its pleasing or displeasing emotional connection.  For example, a stubborn person may be described as being either strong-willed or pig-headed; although these have the same literal meaning (stubborn), strong-willed connotes admiration for the level of someone's will (a positive connotation), while pig-headed connotes frustration in dealing with someone (a negative connotation). Usage"Connotation" branches into a mixture of different meanings. 

Interstate Commerce Commission<====>55678<====>Interstate Commerce Commission The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) was a regulatory agency in the United States created by the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887.  The agency's original purpose was to regulate railroads (and later trucking) to ensure fair rates, to eliminate rate discrimination, and to regulate other aspects of common carriers, including interstate bus lines and telephone companies.  Congress expanded ICC authority to regulate other modes of commerce beginning in 1906.  The agency was abolished in 1995, and its remaining functions were transferred to the Surface Transportation Board. The Commission's five members were appointed by the President with the consent of the United States Senate. 

Peter the Aleut<====>55680<====>Peter the Aleut Cungagnaq (date of birth unknown - d.  1815) is venerated as a martyr and saint (as Peter the Aleut) by some jurisdictions of the Eastern Orthodox Church.   He was allegedly a native of Kodiak Island (Alutiiq or Sugpiaq), and is said to have received the Christian name of Peter when he was baptized into the Orthodox faith by the monks of St.  Herman's missionaries operating in the north.  All Saints of North America, an Orthodox Church in Virginia, USAHe is purported to have been captured by Spanish soldiers near "San Pedro" and tortured and killed at the instigation of Roman Catholic priests either there or at a nearby location.

Time-out (parenting)<====>55684<====>Time-out (parenting)Time-out (also known as social exclusion) is a form of behavioral modification that involves temporarily separating a person from an environment where unacceptable behavior has occurred.  The goal is to remove that person from an enriched, enjoyable environment, and therefore lead to extinction of the offending behavior .  It is an educational and parenting technique recommended by most pediatricians and developmental psychologists as an effective form of discipline.  Often a corner (hence the common term corner time) or a similar space where the person is to stand or sit during time-outs is designated.  This form of discipline is especially popular in western cultures. 

Andrew Bobola<====>55686<====>Andrew Bobola Saint Andrew Bobola, S. J.  ( , 1591 – 16 May 1657) was a Polish missionary and martyr of the Society of Jesus, known as the Apostle of Lithuania and the "hunter of souls".  LifeBobola was born in 1591 into a noble family in the Sandomir Palatinate in the Province of Lesser Poland of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, then a constituent part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.  In 1611 he entered the Society of Jesus in Vilnius, then in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the other part of the Commonwealth.  He subsequently professed solemn vows and was ordained in 1622, after which he served for several years as an advisor, preacher, Superior of a Jesuit residence, etc. 

Silver City Airways<====>55687<====>Silver City Airways   Silver City Airways was a private, British independent independent from government-owned corporations  airline formed in 1946.  The name Silver City was derived from the eponymous Australian mining town at Broken Hill, where the Zinc Corporation was headquartered.  Silver City's first commercial flight departed London Heathrow for Sydney via Johannesburg in late 1946.  The following year, Silver City leased its first Bristol Freighter, moved its base to Blackbushe and participated in the airlift of Hindu and Muslim refugees between Pakistan and India.

Buckinghamshire<====>55688<====>BuckinghamshireBuckinghamshire (  or  ),  abbreviated Bucks,  is a county in South East England which borders Greater London to the south east, Berkshire to the south, Oxfordshire to the west, Northamptonshire to the north, Bedfordshire to the north east and Hertfordshire to the east. Buckinghamshire is one of the home counties and towns such as High Wycombe, Amersham, Chesham and the Chalfonts in the east and southeast of the county are parts of the London commuter belt, forming some of the most densely-populated parts of the county.   Development in this region is restricted by the Metropolitan Green Belt. 

Acre, Israel<====>55690<====>Acre, Israel   Acre (  or  ,  , ʻAko, most commonly spelled as Akko;  , ʻAkkā)  is a city in the northern coastal plain region of the Northern District, Israel at the northern extremity of Haifa Bay.  The city occupies an important location, as it sits on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, traditionally linking the waterways and commercial activity with the Levant.  "Old City of Acre. ", UNESCO World Heritage Center.  World Heritage Convention.  Web.  15 Apr 2013  The important land routes meeting here are the north–south one following the coast and the road cutting inland through the Plain of Esdraelon; Acre also benefits from one of the very rare natural harbours on the coast of the Land of Israel. 

Turquoise<====>55693<====>Turquoise  Turquoise is an opaque, blue-to-green mineral that is a hydrated phosphate of copper and aluminium, with the chemical formula CuAl 6 (PO 4 ) 4 (OH) 8 ·4H 2 O.  It is rare and valuable in finer grades and has been prized as a gemstone and ornamental stone for thousands of years owing to its unique hue.  In recent times, turquoise has been devalued, like most other opaque gems, by the introduction onto the market of treatments, imitations and synthetics. The gemstone has been known by many names.  Pliny the Elder referred to the mineral as callais and the Aztecs knew it as chalchihuitl. 

Mirage<====>55695<====>Mirage A mirage is a naturally occurring optical phenomenon in which light rays bend to produce a displaced image of distant objects or the sky.  The word comes to English via the French mirage, from the Latin mirari, meaning "to look at, to wonder at".  This is the same root as for "mirror" and "to admire". Mirages can be categorized as "inferior" (meaning lower), "superior" (meaning higher) and "Fata Morgana", one kind of superior mirage consisting of a series of unusually elaborate, vertically stacked images, which form one rapidly changing mirage. In contrast to a hallucination, a mirage is a real optical phenomenon that can be captured on camera, since light rays are actually refracted to form the false image at the observer's location. 

Parenting<====>55697<====>Parenting  Parenting or child rearing is the process of promoting and supporting the physical, emotional, social, and intellectual development of a child from infancy to adulthood.  Parenting refers to the intricacies of raising a child aside from the biological relationship.  The most common caretaker in parenting is the biological parent(s) of the child in question, although others may be an older sibling, a grandparent, a legal guardian, aunt, uncle or other family member, or a family friend.   Governments and society may have a role in child-rearing as well.  In many cases, orphaned or abandoned children receive parental care from non-parent blood relations. 

Tactile illusions<====>55700<====>Tactile illusionsTactile illusions are illusions that affect the sense of touch.   Some tactile illusions require active touch (e. g. , movement of the fingers or hands), whereas others can be evoked passively (e. g. , with external stimuli that press against the skin).  In recent years, a growing interest among perceptual researchers has led to the discovery of new tactile illusions and to the celebration of tactile illusions in the popular science press.   Some tactile illusions are analogous to visual and auditory illusions, suggesting that these sensory systems may process information in similar ways; other tactile illusions don't have obvious visual or auditory analogs. 

Hospital volunteer<====>55702<====>Hospital volunteer   Hospital volunteers also known as candy stripers work without regular pay in a variety of health care settings, usually under the direct supervision of nurses.  Most hospitals train and supervise volunteers through specialized non-profit organizations known as auxiliaries.  Directors of auxiliaries are most often paid employees of the hospitals. The term candy striper is derived from the red-and-white striped pinafores that female volunteers traditionally wore in the United States, and are culturally reminiscent of candy canes.  The term and its associated uniform are less frequently used in current clinical settings. Another hospital volunteer organization sponsored by the American Red Cross, was the "Blue Teens" who wore blue-and-white striped pinafores. 

Richard Whittington<====>55706<====>Richard Whittington    Sir Richard Whittington (c.  1354–1423 ) was an English merchant and a politician of the late medieval period.  He is also the real-life inspiration for the English folk tale Dick Whittington and His Cat.  He was four times Lord Mayor of London, a member of parliament and a sheriff of London.  In his lifetime he financed a number of public projects, such as drainage systems in poor areas of medieval London, and a hospital ward for unmarried mothers.  He bequeathed his fortune to form the Charity of Sir Richard Whittington which, nearly 600 years later, continues to assist people in need. 

Sherman Silver Purchase Act<====>55708<====>Sherman Silver Purchase ActThe Sherman Silver Purchase Act was a United States federal law enacted on July 14, 1890.  Charles Ramsdell Lingley, Since the Civil War, first edition: New York, The Century Co. , 1920, ix-635 p. ,  .  Re-issued: Plain Label Books, unknown date, under a new title: The United States Since the Civil War, 310 p.  See: page [  173] (Google Books).  The measure did not authorize the free and unlimited coinage of silver that the Free Silver supporters wanted;  however, it increased the amount of silver the government was required to purchase on a recurrent monthly basis to 4. 

McKinley Tariff<====>55710<====>McKinley TariffThe Tariff Act of 1890, commonly called the McKinley Tariff, was an act of the United States Congress framed by Representative William McKinley that became law on October 1, 1890.   The tariff raised the average duty on imports to almost fifty percent, an act designed to protect domestic industries from foreign competition.    Protectionism, a tactic supported by Republicans, was fiercely debated by politicians and condemned by Democrats.   The McKinley Tariff was replaced with the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act in 1894, which promptly lowered tariff rates.  BackgroundTariffs, taxes on foreign goods entering a country, served two purposes for the United States in the late 19th century. 

Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act<====>55711<====>Wilson–Gorman Tariff ActThe Revenue Act or Wilson-Gorman Tariff of 1894 (ch.  349, §73,  , August 27, 1894) slightly reduced the  United States tariff rates from the numbers set in the 1890 McKinley tariff and imposed a 2% income tax.  It is named for William L.  Wilson, Representative from West Virginia, chair of the U. S.  House Ways and Means Committee, and Senator Arthur P.  Gorman of Maryland, both Democrats. Supported by pro-free trade members of the Democratic Party, this attempt at tariff reform imposed the first peacetime income tax (2% on income over $4,000, or $88,100 in 2010 dollars, which meant fewer than 10% of households would pay any). 

Dawes Act<====>55714<====>Dawes Act   The Dawes Act of 1887 (also known as the General Allotment Act or the Dawes Severalty Act of 1887),    adopted by Congress in 1887, authorized the President of the United States to survey American Indian tribal land and divide it into allotments for individual Indians.  Those who accepted allotments and lived separately from the tribe would be granted United States citizenship.  The Dawes Act was amended in 1891, in 1898 by the Curtis Act, and again in 1906 by the Burke Act. The Act was named for its creator, Senator Henry Laurens Dawes of Massachusetts. 

Dingley Act<====>55715<====>Dingley Act The Dingley Act of 1897 (ch.  11,  , July 24, 1897), introduced by U. S.  Representative Nelson Dingley, Jr. , of Maine, raised tariffs in United States to counteract the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act of 1894, which had lowered rates.  Came into effect under William McKinley the first year that he was in office.  The McKinley administration wanted to slowly bring back the protectionism that was proposed by the Tariff of 1890. Following the election of 1896, McKinley followed through with his promises for protectionism.   Congress imposed duties on wool and hides which had been duty-free since 1872. 

Hua Mulan<====>55716<====>Hua Mulan  Hua Mulan ( ) is a legendary woman warrior from the Northern and Southern dynasties period (420–589) of Chinese history, originally described in the Ballad of Mulan ( ).  In the ballad, Hua Mulan takes her aged father's place in the army.  She is a beautiful and strong woman known for practicing martial arts and for being skilled with the sword.  Mulan fought for twelve years and gained high merit, but she refused any reward and retired to her hometown. The historic setting of Hua Mulan is in the Northern Wei (386–536).  Over a thousand years later, Xu Wei's play from the Ming dynasty places her in the Northern Wei, whereas the Qing dynasty Sui Tang Romance has her active around the founding of the Tang c. 

Mulan (Disney character)<====>55717<====>Mulan (Disney character)  Fa Mulan is a character, inspired by an actual historic figure, who appears in Walt Disney Pictures' 36th animated feature film Mulan (1998), as well as its sequel  Mulan II (2004).  Her speaking voice is provided by actress Ming-Na Wen, while singer Lea Salonga provides the character's singing voice.  Created by author Robert D.  San Souci, Mulan is based on the legendary Chinese warrior Hua Mulan from the poem the Ballad of Mulan.  The only child of an aging war veteran, Mulan disregards both tradition and the law by disguising herself as a man in order to enlist herself in the army in lieu of her feeble father. 

Foraker Act<====>55718<====>Foraker ActThe Foraker Act,  , officially known as the Organic Act of 1900, is a United States federal law that established civilian (albeit limited popular) government on the island of Puerto Rico, which had recently become a possession of the United States as a result of the Spanish–American War.  Section VII of the Foraker Act also established Puerto Rican citizenship.   President William McKinley signed the act on April 12, 1900  and it became known as the Foraker Act after its sponsor, Ohio Senator Joseph B.  Foraker.   Its main author has been identified as Secretary of War Elihu Root. 

Gold Standard Act<====>55719<====>Gold Standard Act  The Gold Standard Act of the United States was passed in 1900 (approved on March 14) and established gold as the only standard for redeeming paper money, stopping bimetallism (which had allowed silver in exchange for gold).  It was signed by President William McKinley. The Act made the de facto gold standard in place since the Coinage Act of 1873 (whereby debt holders could demand reimbursement in whatever metal was preferred—usually gold) a de jure gold standard alongside other major European powers at the time. The Act fixed the value of the dollar at   grains of gold at "nine-tenths fine" (90% purity), equivalent to 23. 

Mulan (1998 film)<====>55720<====>Mulan (1998 film)Mulan is a 1998 American animated musical action comedy-drama film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation for Walt Disney Pictures.  It is based on the Chinese legend of Hua Mulan, and was Disney's 36th animated feature.  It was directed by Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook, with story by Robert D.  San Souci and screenplay by Rita Hsiao, Philip LaZebnik, Chris Sanders, Eugenia Bostwick-Singer, and Raymond Singer.  Ming-Na, Eddie Murphy, Miguel Ferrer and B.  D.  Wong star in the English version, while Jackie Chan provided the voice of Captain Li Shang for the Chinese dubs of the film. 

King Lear<====>55721<====>King Lear    King Lear is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare.  It depicts the gradual descent into madness of the title character, after he disposes of his kingdom giving bequests to two of his three daughters based on their flattery of him, bringing tragic consequences for all.  Derived from the legend of Leir of Britain, a mythological pre-Roman Celtic king, the play has been widely adapted for the stage and motion pictures, with the title role coveted by many of the world's most accomplished actors. The first attribution to Shakespeare of this play, originally drafted in 1605 or 1606 at the latest with its first known performance on St. 

Gentlemen's agreement<====>55726<====>Gentlemen's agreement A gentlemen's agreement or gentleman's agreement is an informal and legally non-binding   between two or more parties.  It is typically oral, though it may be written, or simply understood as part of an unspoken agreement by convention or through mutually beneficial etiquette.  The essence of a gentlemen's agreement is that it relies upon the honor of the parties for its fulfillment, rather than being in any way enforceable.  It is, therefore, distinct from a legal agreement or contract, which can be enforced if necessary. HistoryThe phrase appears in British Parliamentary records of 1821,  and in Massachusetts public records of 1835. 

Newlands Reclamation Act<====>55727<====>Newlands Reclamation ActThe Reclamation Act (also known as the Lowlands Reclamation Act or National Reclamation Act) of 1902 ( ) is a United States federal law that funded irrigation projects for the arid lands of 20 states in the American West. The act at first covered only 13 of the western states as Texas had no federal lands.  Texas was added later by a special act passed in 1906.  The act set aside money from sales of semi-arid public lands for the construction and maintenance of irrigation projects.  The newly irrigated land would be sold and money would be put into a revolving fund that supported more such projects. 

Federal Meat Inspection Act<====>55728<====>Federal Meat Inspection Act The Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906 (FMIA) is an American law that makes it a crime to adulterate or misbrand meat and meat products being sold as food, and ensures that meat and meat products are slaughtered and processed under sanitary conditions. These requirements also apply to imported meat products, which must be inspected under equivalent foreign standards.  USDA inspection of poultry was added by the Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957.  The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act authorizes the FDA to provide inspection services for all livestock and poultry species not listed in the FMIA or PPIA, including venison and buffalo. 

Pure Food and Drug Act<====>55729<====>Pure Food and Drug Act   The   was the first of a series of significant consumer protection laws which was enacted by Congress in the 20th century and led to the creation of the Food and Drug Administration.  Its main purpose was to ban foreign and interstate traffic in adulterated or mislabeled food and drug products, and it directed the U. S.

It required that active ingredients be placed on the label of a drug’s packaging and that drugs could not fall below purity levels established by the United States Pharmacopeia or the National Formulary. 

Aldrich–Vreeland Act<====>55731<====>Aldrich–Vreeland ActThe Aldrich–Vreeland Act was passed in response to the Panic of 1907 and established the National Monetary Commission, which recommended the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. On May 27, 1908, the bill passed the House on a mostly party-line vote of 166–140, with 13 Republicans voting against it and no Democrats voting for it.    On May 30, it passed in the Senate with 43 Republicans in favor and five Republicans joining 17 Democrats opposed.   President Roosevelt signed the bill that same night.  The act also allowed national banks to start national currency associations in groups of ten or more, with at least $5 million in total capital, to issue emergency currency. 

Elkins Act<====>55732<====>Elkins Act The Elkins Act is a 1903 United States federal law that amended the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887.  The Act authorized the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to impose heavy fines on railroads that offered rebates, and upon the shippers that accepted these rebates.   The railroad companies were not permitted to offer rebates.  Railroad corporations, their officers, and their employees, were all made liable for discriminatory practices.    Prior to the Elkins Act, the livestock and petroleum industries paid standard rail shipping rates, but then would demand that the railroad company give them rebates. 

Hepburn Act<====>55733<====>Hepburn ActThe Hepburn Act is a 1906 United States federal law that gave the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) the power to set maximum railroad rates and extend its jurisdiction.  This led to the discontinuation of free passes to loyal shippers.   In addition, the ICC could view the railroads' financial records, a task simplified by standardized bookkeeping systems.  For any railroad that resisted, the ICC's conditions would remain in effect until the outcome of legislation said otherwise.  By the Hepburn Act, the ICC's authority was extended to cover bridges, terminals, ferries, railroad sleeping cars, express companies and oil pipelines. 

Payne–Aldrich Tariff Act<====>55734<====>Payne–Aldrich Tariff Act The Payne–Aldrich Tariff Act of 1909 (ch.  6, 36 Stat.  11), named for Representative Sereno E.  Payne (R–NY) and Senator Nelson W.  Aldrich (R–RI), began in the United States House of Representatives as a bill raising certain tariffs on goods entering the United States. The high rates angered Republican reformers, and led to a deep split in the Republican Party. HistoryIt was the first change in tariff laws since the Dingley Act of 1897.President William Howard Taft called Congress into a special session in 1909 shortly after his inauguration to discuss the issue.

Federal Farm Loan Act<====>55738<====>Federal Farm Loan Act  The Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916 ( ) was a United States federal law aimed at increasing credit to rural family farmers.  It did so by creating a federal farm loan board, twelve regional farm loan banks and tens of farm loan associations.   The act was signed into law by President of the United States Woodrow Wilson. BackgroundIn 1908, the Administration of Theodore Roosevelt commissioned a study on the problems facing rural families.  At this point in U. S.  history, these families made up the largest demographic of Americans. 

Railway Labor Act<====>55739<====>Railway Labor Act The Railway Labor Act is a United States federal law on US labor law that governs labor relations in the railroad and airline industries.  The Act, passed in 1926 and amended in 1934 and 1936, seeks to substitute bargaining, arbitration and mediation for strikes to resolve labor disputes.   Its provisions were originally enforced under the Board of Mediation, but they were later enforced under a National Mediation Board. Earlier laws The Great Railroad Strike of 1877 lasted for six weeks and was eventually put down with the intervention of federal troops.  Congress later passed the  Arbitration Act of 1888, which authorized the creation of arbitration panels with the power to investigate the causes of labor disputes and to issue non-binding arbitration awards. 

Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914<====>55740<====>Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914  The Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 ( , codified at  ,  ), was a part of United States antitrust law with the goal of adding further substance to the U. S.  antitrust law regime; the Clayton Act sought to prevent anticompetitive practices in their incipiency.  That regime started with the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, the first Federal law outlawing practices considered harmful to consumers (monopolies, cartels, and trusts).  The Clayton Act specified particular prohibited conduct, the three-level enforcement scheme, the exemptions, and the remedial measures. Like the Sherman Act, much of the substance of the Clayton Act has been developed and animated by the U. 

Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914<====>55741<====>Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914The Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 established the Federal Trade Commission.  The Act, signed into law by Woodrow Wilson in 1914, outlaws unfair methods of competition and outlaws unfair acts or practices that affect commerce.    BackgroundThe inspiration and motivation for this act started in 1890, when the Sherman Act was passed.  This era in time was an antitrust movement to prevent manufacturers from joining price-fixing cartels.    After the case Northern Securities Co.  v.  United States, which dismantled a J.  P.  Morgan company, antitrust enforcement became institutionalized. 

Federal Reserve Act<====>55742<====>Federal Reserve Act The Federal Reserve Act (ch.  6,  , enacted December 23, 1913, 12 U. S. C.  §§ 221 to 522) is an Act of Congress that created and established the Federal Reserve System (the central banking system of the United States), and which created the authority to issue Federal Reserve Notes (commonly known as the US Dollar) as legal tender.

There were to be at least eight and no more than twelve private regional Federal Reserve banks. 

Mann Act<====>55744<====>Mann Act  The White-Slave Traffic Act, or the Mann Act, is a United States federal law, passed June 25, 1910 (ch.  395,  ; codified as amended at  ). It is named after Congressman James Robert Mann of Illinois, and in its original form made it a felony to engage in interstate or foreign commerce transport of "any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose".  Its primary stated intent was to address prostitution, immorality, and human trafficking, particularly where trafficking was for the purposes of prostitution.  This is one of several acts of protective legislation aimed at moral reform during the progressive era. 

Mann–Elkins Act<====>55745<====>Mann–Elkins ActThe Mann–Elkins Act was a 1910 United States federal law that was among the Progressive era reforms.   The Act got its name from congressmen Stephen Benton Elkins and James Robert Mann.  Both congressmen sponsored and created legislation about interstate trade which would go on to be signed into law.  The Mann–Elkins Act would further expand upon the work by these two men (the Elkins Act and the Mann Act).  The act was part of an initiative by President William Howard Taft "to regulate destructive competition and unfair trade practices" in order to make good on promises made during his campaign. 

Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929<====>55751<====>Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929  The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929, under the administration of Herbert Hoover, established the Federal Farm Board from the Federal Farm Loan Board established by the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916 with a revolving fund of half a billion dollars.   The original act was sponsored by Hoover in an attempt to stop the downward spiral of crop prices by seeking to buy, sell and store agricultural surpluses or by generously lending money to farm organizations.  Money was lent out to the farmers in order to buy seed and food for the livestock, which was especially important since there had previously been a drought in the Democratic South. 

Indian Reorganization Act<====>55752<====>Indian Reorganization Act The Indian Reorganization Act of June 18, 1934, or the Wheeler-Howard Act, was U. S.  federal legislation that dealt with the status of Native Americans (known in law as American Indians or Indians).   It was the centerpiece of what has been often called the "Indian New Deal".   The major goal was to reverse the traditional goal of assimilation of Indians into American society, and to strengthen, encourage and perpetuate the tribes and their historic traditions and culture. The Act also restored to Indians the management of their assets—land and mineral rights—and included provisions intended to create a sound economic foundation for the inhabitants of Indian reservations. 

Fordney–McCumber Tariff<====>55755<====>Fordney–McCumber Tariff The Fordney–McCumber Tariff of 1922 was a law that raised American tariffs on many imported goods to protect factories and farms.  The US Congress displayed a pro-business attitude in passing the tariff and in promoting foreign trade through providing huge loans to Europe, which, in turn, bought more US goods.  The Roaring Twenties brought a period of sustained economic prosperity after the Depression of 1920–21. BackgroundThe first sector of the economy that was hit by a fall in postwar demand was agriculture.  During World War I, the American agricultural industry had enjoyed prosperity through the raising of prices, which led to increased output that Americans used to supply Europe. 

Shepard tone<====>55757<====>Shepard tone A Shepard tone, named after Roger Shepard, is a sound consisting of a superposition of sine waves separated by octaves.  When played with the bass pitch of the tone moving upward or downward, it is referred to as the Shepard scale.  This creates the auditory illusion of a tone that continually ascends or descends in pitch, yet which ultimately seems to get no higher or lower.  ConstructionEach square in the figure indicates a tone, with any set of squares in vertical alignment together making one Shepard tone.  The color of each square indicates the loudness of the note, with purple being the quietest and green the loudest. 

Emergency Quota Act<====>55758<====>Emergency Quota Act The Emergency Quota Act, also known as the Emergency Immigration Act of 1921, the Immigration Restriction Act of 1921, the Per Centum Law, and the Johnson Quota Act (ch.  8,   of May 19, 1921) restricted immigration into the United States.  Although intended as temporary legislation, the Act "proved in the long run the most important turning-point in American immigration policy"  because it added two new features to American immigration law: numerical limits on immigration and the use of a quota system for establishing those limits.   These limits came to be known as the National Origins Formula. 

Esch–Cummins Act<====>55759<====>Esch–Cummins ActThe Transportation Act, 1920, commonly known as the Esch–Cummins Act,  was a United States federal law that returned railroads to private operation after World War I, with much regulation.   It also officially encouraged private consolidation of railroads and mandated that the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) ensure their profitability. BackgroundThe United States had entered World War I in April 1917, and the government found that the nation's railroads were not prepared to serve the war effort.  On December 26, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson had ordered that U. S.  railroads be nationalized in the public interest. 

Volstead Act<====>55761<====>Volstead Act  The National Prohibition Act, known informally as the Volstead Act, was enacted to carry out the intent of the 18th Amendment, which established prohibition in the United States.  The Anti-Saloon League's Wayne Wheeler conceived and drafted the bill, which was named for Andrew Volstead, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who managed the legislation. ProcedureWhile the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited the production, sale, and transport of "intoxicating liquors", it did not define "intoxicating liquors" or provide penalties.  It granted both the federal government and the states the power to enforce the ban by "appropriate legislation". 

Harmonic function<====>55762<====>Harmonic function In mathematics, mathematical physics and the theory of stochastic processes, a harmonic function is a twice continuously differentiable function f : U → R (where U is an open subset of R n ) which satisfies Laplace's equation, i. e.   \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_1^2} + \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_2^2} + \cdots + \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_n^2} = 0 everywhere on U.  This is usually written as  \nabla^2 f = 0  or \textstyle \Delta f = 0 Etymology of the term "harmonic"The descriptor "harmonic" in the name harmonic function originates from a point on a taut string which is undergoing harmonic motion. 

Norris–La Guardia Act<====>55766<====>Norris–La Guardia ActThe Norris–La Guardia Act (also known as the Anti-Injunction Bill) is a 1932 United States federal law on US labor law.   It banned yellow-dog contracts, barred the federal courts from issuing injunctions against nonviolent labor disputes, and created a positive right of noninterference by employers against workers joining trade unions.  The common title comes from the names of the sponsors of the legislation: Senator George W.  Norris of Nebraska and Representative Fiorello H.  La Guardia of New York, both Republicans.

Public Works Administration<====>55769<====>Public Works AdministrationPublic Works Administration (PWA), part of the New Deal of 1933 was a large-scale public  works construction agency in the United States headed by Secretary of the Interior Harold L.  Ickes.  It was created by the National Industrial Recovery Act in June 1933 in response to the Great Depression.  It built large-scale public works such as dams, bridges, hospitals, and schools.  Its goals were to spend $3. 3 billion in the first year, and $6 billion in all, to provide employment, stabilize purchasing power, and help revive the economy.  Most of the spending came in two waves in 1933-35, and again in 1938. 

Tennessee Valley Authority<====>55770<====>Tennessee Valley Authority The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is a federally owned corporation in the United States created by congressional charter on May 18, 1933 to provide navigation, flood control, electricity generation, fertilizer manufacturing, and economic development to the Tennessee Valley, a region particularly affected by the Great Depression.  The enterprise was a result of the efforts of Senator George W.  Norris of Nebraska.  TVA was envisioned not only as a provider, but also as a regional economic development agency that would use federal experts and electricity to rapidly modernize the region's economy and society. T.

The loans purchased were for homeowners who were having problems making the payments on their mortgage loans "through no fault of their own". 

Farm Credit Administration<====>55772<====>Farm Credit Administration The Farm Credit Administration is an independent agency of the Executive Branch of the federal government of the United States.   It regulates and examines the banks, associations, and related entities of the Farm Credit System, a network of borrower-owned financial institutions that provide credit to farmers, ranchers, and agricultural and rural utility cooperatives.  It derives its authority from the Farm Credit Act of 1971.   The FCA is headquartered in McLean, Virginia, near Washington, DC. HistoryThe Farm Credit Administration was established by Executive Order 6084, which transferred most of the functions of the Federal Farm Board to the new Agricultural Adjustment Administration. 

Civil Works Administration<====>55773<====>Civil Works AdministrationThe Civil Works Administration (CWA) was a short-lived U. S.  job creation program established by the New Deal during the Great Depression to rapidly create manual labor jobs for millions of unemployed workers.  The jobs were merely temporary, for the duration of the hard winter of 1933–34.   President Franklin D.  Roosevelt unveiled the CWA on November 8, 1933, and put Harry L.  Hopkins in charge of the short-term agency. The CWA was a project created under the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA).  The CWA created construction jobs, mainly improving or constructing buildings and bridges. 

Agricultural Adjustment Act<====>55774<====>Agricultural Adjustment Act  The Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) was a United States federal law of the New Deal era designed to boost agricultural prices by reducing surpluses.  The Government bought livestock for slaughter and paid farmers subsidies not to plant part of their land.  The money for these subsidies was generated through an exclusive tax on companies which processed farm products.  The Act created a new agency, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, an agency of the U. S.  Department of Agriculture, to oversee the distribution of the subsidies.    Hurt, R.

Its purpose was to boost the country’s confidence and help banks resume daily functions after the start of the Great Depression.  The RFC became more prominent under the New Deal and continued to operate through World War II.  It was disbanded in 1957, when the US government concluded that it no longer needed to stimulate lending. The RFC was an independent agency of the United States government, and fully owned and operated by the government. 

Works Progress Administration<====>55779<====>Works Progress Administration The Works Progress Administration (WPA; renamed in 1939 as the Work Projects Administration) was the largest and most ambitious American New Deal agency, employing millions of people (mostly unskilled men) to carry out public works projects,    including the construction of public buildings and roads.  In a much smaller project, Federal Project Number One, the WPA employed musicians, artists, writers, actors and directors in large arts, drama, media, and literacy projects.  Almost every community in the United States had a new park, bridge or school constructed by the agency.  The WPA's initial appropriation in 1935 was for $4. 

Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Balanced Budget Act<====>55783<====>Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Balanced Budget Act  The Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985  and the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 1987  (both often known as Gramm–Rudman) were the first binding spending constraints on the federal budget.  The acts were named after U. S.  Senators Phil Gramm (R-Texas), Warren Rudman (R-New Hampshire), and Fritz Hollings (D-South Carolina), who were all their chief sponsors. Provisions of ActsThe term "budget sequestration" was first used to describe a section of the Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Deficit Reduction Act of 1985. The Acts aimed to cut the United States federal budget deficit, which at the time, in dollar terms, was the largest in history. 

Gramm-Latta Budget<====>55784<====>Gramm-Latta BudgetThe Gramm-Latta Budget (aka Gramm-Latta Bill) 1981 and the Gramm-Latta Omnibus Reconciliation Bill of 1981, sponsored by Representatives Phil Gramm (a Democrat (later Republican) from Texas) and Delbert Latta (a Republican from Ohio), implemented President Ronald Reagan's economic program.  This included an increase in military spending and major cuts in  discretionary and entitlement spending.  The law also mandated the controversial 1981 Kemp-Roth Tax Cut. In a 2001 press conference to announce his retirement, Gramm had this to say about the bill:  I wrote the first Reagan budget -- the Gramm-Latta budget that rebuilt national defense and that laid the foundation for a program of peace through strength; the Reagan program that tore down the Berlin Wall, that liberated Eastern Europe, that transformed the Soviet Union and that changed the world. 

Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981<====>55786<====>Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 ( ), also known as the ERTA or "Kemp–Roth Tax Cut", was a federal law enacted in the United States in 1981.

Tax Reform Act of 1986<====>55789<====>Tax Reform Act of 1986 The U. S.  Congress passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA) ( ) to simplify the income tax code, broaden the tax base and eliminate many tax shelters.  Referred to as the second of the two "Reagan tax cuts" (the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 being the first), the bill was also officially sponsored by Democrats, Richard Gephardt of Missouri in the House of Representatives and Bill Bradley of New Jersey in the Senate. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was given impetus by a detailed tax-simplification proposal from President Reagan's Treasury Department, and was designed to be tax-revenue neutral because Reagan stated that he would veto any bill that was not. 

Voting Rights Act of 1965<====>55791<====>Voting Rights Act of 1965   The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a landmark piece of federal legislation in the United States that prohibits racial discrimination in voting. It was signed into law by President Lyndon B.  Johnson during the height of the Civil Rights Movement on August 6, 1965, and Congress later amended the Act five times to expand its protections.   Designed to enforce the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Act secured voting rights for racial minorities throughout the country, especially in the South. 

Great Society<====>55792<====>Great Society The Great Society  was a set of domestic programs in the United States launched by Democratic President Lyndon B.  Johnson in 1964–65.   The main goal was the elimination of poverty and racial injustice.  President Johnson first used the term "Great Society" during a speech at Ohio University, then unveiled the program in greater detail at an appearance at University of Michigan.   New major spending programs that addressed education, medical care, urban problems, rural poverty, and transportation were launched during this period.   The program and its initiatives were subsequently promoted by him and fellow Democrats in Congress in the 1960s and years following. 

Medicaid<====>55794<====>Medicaid  Medicaid in the United States is a joint federal and state program that helps with medical costs for some people with limited income and resources.  Medicaid also offers benefits not normally covered by Medicare, like nursing home care and personal care services.  The Health Insurance Association of America describes Medicaid as a "government insurance program for persons of all ages whose income and resources are insufficient to pay for health care".   Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for people with low income in the United States, providing free health insurance to 74 million low-income and disabled people (as of 2017). 

Trade Expansion Act<====>55797<====>Trade Expansion ActThe Trade Expansion Act of 1962 ( ,  ) is an American trade law.HistoryCongress granted the White House unprecedented authority to negotiate tariff reductions of up to 80%. It paved the way for the Kennedy Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ("GATT") negotiations, concluding on June 30, 1967, the last day before expiration of the Act. On April 27, 2017, President Donald Trump ordered a review of the aluminum imports and threats to National security under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.References    

Thessaly<====>55804<====>Thessaly    Thessaly ( , Thessalía; ancient Thessalian:  , Petthalía) is a traditional geographic and modern administrative region of Greece, comprising most of the ancient region of the same name.  Before the Greek Dark Ages, Thessaly was known as Aeolia (  Aíolía), and appears thus in Homer's Odyssey. Thessaly became part of the modern Greek state in 1881, after four and a half centuries of Ottoman rule.  Since 1987 it has formed one of the country's 13 regions  and is further (since the Kallikratis reform of 2010) sub-divided into 5 regional units and 25 municipalities. 

Federal Housing Administration<====>55807<====>Federal Housing Administration The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is a United States government agency created in part by the National Housing Act of 1934.  The FHA sets standards for construction and underwriting and insures loans made by banks and other private lenders for home building.  The goals of this organization are to improve housing standards and conditions, provide an adequate home financing system through insurance of mortgage loans, and to stabilize the mortgage market.  The Acting Commissioner of the FHA is Dana T.  Wade. It is different from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which supervises government-sponsored enterprises. 

Johnson Act<====>55808<====>Johnson Act The Johnson Act of 1934 (Foreign Securities Act, ch. 112,  ,  , 1934-04-13) prohibited foreign nations in default from marketing their bond issues in the United States.

Reciprocal Tariff Act<====>55810<====>Reciprocal Tariff ActThe Reciprocal Tariff Act (enacted June 12, 1934, ch.  474,  ,  ) provided for the negotiation of tariff agreements between the United States and separate nations,  particularly Latin American countries.   The Act served as an institutional reform intended to authorize the president to negotiate with foreign nations to reduce tariffs in return for reciprocal reductions in tariffs in the United States.  It resulted in a reduction of duties. Reciprocal Tariff Act of 1934President Franklin D.  Roosevelt signed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act (RTAA) into law in 1934.   RTAA gave the president power to negotiate bilateral, reciprocal trade agreements with other countries.

It also established limitations on Filipino immigration to the United States. The act was authored in the 73rd United States Congress by Senator Millard E. 

Neutrality Acts of 1930s<====>55813<====>Neutrality Acts of 1930s  The Neutrality Acts were passed by the United States Congress in the  , in response to the growing turmoil in Europe and Asia that eventually led to World War II.  They were spurred by the growth in isolationism and non-interventionism in the US following its costly involvement in World War I, and sought to ensure that the US would not become entangled again in foreign conflicts. The legacy of the Neutrality Acts is widely regarded as having been generally negative: they made no distinction between aggressor and victim, treating both equally as "belligerents"; and they limited the US government's ability to aid Britain and France against Nazi Germany. 

Social Security Act<====>55815<====>Social Security Act   The Social Security Act of 1935  , now codified as  , created Social Security in the United States, and is relevant for US labor law.  It created a basic right to a pension in old age, and insurance against unemployment. BackgroundIn the Second New Deal, the Social Security Act was signed into law by President Franklin D.

The law grew out of practices in which chain stores were allowed to purchase goods at lower prices than other retailers.   An amendment to the Clayton Antitrust Act, it prevented unfair price discrimination for the first time, by requiring that the seller offer the same price terms to customers at a given level of trade. 

Wheeler–Lea Act<====>55821<====>Wheeler–Lea ActThe Wheeler–Lea Act of 1938 is a United States federal law that amended Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to proscribe “unfair or deceptive acts or practices” as well as “unfair methods of competition. ”It provided civil penalties for violations of Section 5 orders.   It also added a clause to Section 5 that stated "unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce are hereby declared unlawful" to the Section 5 prohibition of unfair methods of competition in order to protect consumers as well as competition.

National Defense Education Act<====>55847<====>National Defense Education Act  The National Defense Education Act (NDEA) was signed into law on September 2, 1958, providing funding to United States education institutions at all levels.  Schwegler 1 NDEA was among many science initiatives implemented by President Dwight D.  Eisenhower in 1958 to increase the technological sophistication and power of the United States alongside, for instance, DARPA and NASA.  It followed a growing national sense that U. S.  scientists were falling behind scientists in the Soviet Union.  The early Soviet success in the Space Race catalyzed a national sense of unease with Soviet technological advances, especially after the Soviet Union launched the first-ever satellite, Sputnik, the previous year. 

G.I. Bill<====>55850<====>G. I.  Bill The Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, also known as the G. I.

It was designed by the American Legion, who helped push it through Congress by mobilizing its chapters (along with the Veterans of Foreign Wars); the goal was to provide immediate rewards for practically all World War II veterans. The act avoided the highly disputed postponed life insurance policy payout for World War I veterans that caused political turmoil for a decade and a half after that war. 

Gus Hall<====>55853<====>Gus Hall   Gus Hall (born Arvo Kustaa Halberg; October 8, 1910 – October 13, 2000) was a leader and chairman of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) and its four-time U.

Love (band)<====>55872<====>Love (band)  Love is an American rock group that was most prominent in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  They were originally led by singer/songwriter Arthur Lee   , who wrote most of the songs, although some of their best known songs were written by Bryan MacLean.  One of the first racially diverse American bands, their music drew on a diverse range of sources including folk rock, hard rock, blues, jazz, flamenco and orchestral pop.

Masonic lodge<====>55873<====>Masonic lodge   A Masonic lodge, often termed a private lodge or constituent lodge, is the basic organisational unit of Freemasonry.  It is also commonly, but erroneously, used as a term for a building in which such a unit meets.   Every new lodge must be warranted or chartered by a Grand Lodge, but is subject to its direction only in enforcing the published constitution of the jurisdiction.  By exception the three surviving lodges that formed the world's first known grand lodge in London (now merged into the United Grand Lodge of England) have the unique privilege to operate as time immemorial, i. 

Tabard<====>55875<====>Tabard  A tabard is a short coat common for men during the Middle Ages.  Generally used while outdoors, the coat was either sleeveless or had short sleeves or shoulder pieces.  In its more developed form it was open at the sides, and it could be worn with or without a belt.  Though most were ordinary garments, often workclothes, tabards might be emblazoned on the front and back with a coat of arms (livery), and in this form they survive as the distinctive garment of officers of arms. In modern British usage, the term has been revived for what is known in American English as a cobbler apron: a lightweight open-sided upper overgarment, of similar design to its medieval and heraldic counterpart, worn in particular by workers in the catering, cleaning and healthcare industries as protective clothing, or outdoors by those requiring high-visibility clothing.

It was established in its modern form in 1981 and is located in the northwestern part of the country, respectively the southeastern part of the Alpine massif.    Mount Triglav, the highest peak of Julian Alps, stands almost in the middle of the national park.  From it the valleys spread out radially, supplying water to two large river systems with their sources in the Julian Alps: the Soča and the Sava, flowing to the Adriatic and Black Sea, respectively. HistoryThe proposal for the protection of the Triglav Lakes Valley area was first put forward by the seismologist Albin Belar in 1906 or 1908.

Local currency<====>55886<====>Local currency In economics, a local currency is a currency that can be spent in a particular geographical locality at participating organisations.  A regional currency is a form of local currency encompassing a larger geographical area.  A local currency acts as a  complementary currency to a national currency, rather than replacing it,   and aims to encourage spending within a local community, especially with locally owned businesses.    The currency may not be backed by a national government or be legal tender.   About 300 complementary currencies, including local currencies, are listed in the Complementary Currency Resource Center worldwide database. 

Trusted system<====>55888<====>Trusted systemIn the security engineering subspecialty of computer science, a trusted system is a system that is relied upon to a specified extent to enforce a specified security policy.  This is equivalent to saying that a trusted system is one whose failure would break a security policy (if a policy exists that the trusted system is trusted to enforce). The meaning of the word "trust" is critical, as it does not carry the meaning that might be expected in everyday usage.  A system trusted by a user, is one that the user feels safe to use, and trusts to do tasks without secretly executing harmful or unauthorised programs; while trusted computing refers to whether programs can trust the platform to be unmodified from that expected, whether or not those programs are innocent, malicious or execute tasks that are undesired by the user.

Security-Enhanced Linux<====>55908<====>Security-Enhanced Linux Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)  is a Linux kernel security module that provides a mechanism for supporting access control security policies, including United States Department of Defense–style mandatory access controls (MAC). SELinux is a set of kernel modifications and user-space tools that have been added to various Linux distributions.  Its architecture strives to separate enforcement of security decisions from the security policy itself, and streamlines the amount of software involved with security policy enforcement.    The key concepts underlying SELinux can be traced to several earlier projects by the United States National Security Agency (NSA). OverviewFrom NSA Security-enhanced Linux Team:  NSA Security-Enhanced Linux is a set of patches to the Linux kernel and utilities to provide a strong, flexible, mandatory access control (MAC) architecture into the major subsystems of the kernel. 

Laurel and Hardy<====>55909<====>Laurel and Hardy   Laurel and Hardy were a comedy double act during the early Classical Hollywood era of American cinema.

The duo's signature tune is known variously as "The Cuckoo Song", "Ku-Ku", or "The Dance of the Cuckoos".  It was played over the opening credits of their films and has become as emblematic of the duo as their bowler hats. 

Gouraud shading<====>55913<====>Gouraud shading  Gouraud shading, named after Henri Gouraud, is an interpolation method used in computer graphics to produce continuous shading of surfaces represented by polygon meshes.  In practice, Gouraud shading is most often used to achieve continuous lighting on triangle surfaces by computing the lighting at the corners of each triangle and linearly interpolating the resulting colours for each pixel covered by the triangle.  Gouraud first published the technique in 1971.    DescriptionGouraud shading works as follows: An estimate to the surface normal of each vertex in a polygonal 3D model is either specified for each vertex or found by averaging the surface normals of the polygons that meet at each vertex. 

Richard Leveridge<====>55914<====>Richard Leveridge Richard Leveridge (or Leueridge) (19 July 1670 – 22 March 1758) was an English bass singer of the London stage and a composer of baroque music, including many popular songs.

Prostatitis<====>55922<====>Prostatitis Prostatitis is inflammation of the prostate gland.  Prostatitis is classified into acute, chronic, asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis, and chronic pelvic pain syndrome. In the United States, prostatitis is diagnosed in 8 percent of all urologist visits and 1 percent of all primary care physician visits.    ClassificationThe term prostatitis refers, in its strictest sense, to histological (microscopic) inflammation of the tissue of the prostate gland.  Like all forms of inflammation, it can be associated with an appropriate response of the body to an infection, but it also occurs in the absence of infection. In 1999, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) devised a new classification system. 

Prostate<====>55924<====>Prostate  The prostate (from Ancient Greek προστάτης, prostates, literally "one who stands before", "protector", "guardian" ) is a compound tubuloalveolar exocrine gland of the male reproductive system in most mammals. It differs considerably among species anatomically, chemically, and physiologically. The function of the prostate is to secrete a slightly alkaline fluid, milky or white in appearance, that in humans usually constitutes roughly 30% of the volume of the semen along with spermatozoa and seminal vesicle fluid.   Semen is made alkaline overall with the secretions from the other contributing glands, including, at least, the seminal vesicle fluid. 

Urinary system<====>55927<====>Urinary system  The urinary system, also known as the renal system, consists of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and the urethra.  Each kidney consists of millions of functional units called nephrons.  The purpose of the renal system is to eliminate wastes from the body, regulate blood volume and blood pressure, control levels of electrolytes and metabolites, and regulate blood pH.  The kidneys have an extensive blood supply via the renal arteries which leave the kidneys via the renal vein.  Following filtration of blood and further processing, wastes (in the form of urine) exit the kidney via the ureters, tubes made of smooth muscle fibers that propel urine towards the urinary bladder, where it is stored and subsequently expelled from the body by urination (voiding). 

Governor-general<====>55929<====>Governor-general  Governor-general (plural governors-general) or governor general  (plural governors general), in modern usage, is the title of an office-holder appointed to represent the monarch of a sovereign state in the governing of an independent realm.   Governors-General have also previously been appointed in respect of major colonial states or other territories held by either a monarchy or republic, such as French Indochina. Current usesIn modern usage, the term governor-general originated in those British colonies which became self-governing within the British Empire.  Before World War I, the title was used only in federated colonies in which each of the previously constituent colonies of these federated colonies already had a governor, namely Canada, Australia, and the Union of South Africa. 

Chronology<====>55931<====>Chronology  Chronology (from Latin chronologia, from Ancient Greek  , chrónos, "time"; and  ,  )  is the science of arranging events in their order of occurrence in time.  Consider, for example, the use of a timeline or sequence of events.  It is also "the determination of the actual temporal sequence of past events".  Memidex/WordNet, "chronology," memidex. com (accessed September 25, 2010).  Chronology is part of periodization.  It is also part of the discipline of history, including earth history, the earth sciences, and study of the geologic time scale. Related fieldsChronology is the science of locating historical events in time. 

Eric Corley<====>55934<====>Eric Corley  Eric Gordon Corley (born December 16, 1959), also frequently referred to by his pen name of Emmanuel Goldstein, is a figure in the hacker community.  He directs the non-profit organization 2600 Enterprises, Inc. ,  and publishes a magazine called 2600: The Hacker Quarterly.  His pseudonym is derived from the fictional opposition leader in George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. In 1993, Corley testified before the United States House of Representatives Subcommittee on Telecommunications.  Corley was questioned in relation to the content of 2600 as part of discussions concerning the Digital Telephony Bill; also known as the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act. 

2600: The Hacker Quarterly<====>55935<====>2600: The Hacker Quarterly  2600: The Hacker Quarterly is an American seasonal publication of technical information and articles, many of which are written and submitted by the readership, on a variety of subjects including hacking, telephone switching systems, Internet protocols and services, as well as general news concerning the computer "underground". With origins in the phreaking community and late 20th century counterculture, 2600 and its associated conference transitioned to coverage of modern hacker culture, and the magazine has become a platform for speaking out against increased digital surveillance and advocacy of personal and digital freedoms.   Publication historyThe magazine's name comes from the phreaker discovery in the 1960s that the transmission of a 2600 hertz tone (which could be produced perfectly with a plastic toy whistle given away free with Cap'n Crunch cereal—discovered by friends of John Draper) over a long-distance trunk connection gained access to "operator mode" and allowed the user to explore aspects of the telephone system that were not otherwise accessible.

Nulla poena sine lege<====>55940<====>Nulla poena sine lege Nulla poena sine lege (Latin for "no penalty without a law") is a legal principle, requiring that one cannot be punished for doing something that is not prohibited by law.  This principle is accepted and codified in modern democratic states as a basic requirement of the rule of law.   It has been described as "one of the most 'widely held value-judgement[s] in the entire history of human thought .  RequirementsIn modern European criminal law, e. g.  of the Constitutional Court of Germany, the principle of nulla poena sine lege has been found to consist of four separate requirements: Nulla poena sine  praevia  lege poenali  There is to be no penalty without previous penalizing law. 

Special Air Service<====>55942<====>Special Air Service    The Special Air Service (SAS) is a special forces unit of the British Army.  The SAS was founded in 1941 as a regiment, and later reconstituted as a corps in 1950.The unit undertakes a number of roles including covert reconnaissance, counter-terrorism, direct action and hostage rescue.  Much of the information and actions regarding the SAS is highly classified, and is not commented on by the British government or the Ministry of Defence due to the sensitivity of their operations.    The corps currently consists of the 22nd Special Air Service Regiment, the regular component under operational command of United Kingdom Special Forces, as well as the 21st (Artists) Special Air Service Regiment (Reserve) and the 23rd Special Air Service Regiment (Reserve), which are reserve units under operational command of the 1st Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Brigade. 

Eh<====>55944<====>Eh   Eh (  or  ) is a spoken interjection in English that is similar in meaning to "Excuse me?," "Please repeat that", or "Huh?".  It is also commonly used as an alternative to the question tag right?, i. e. , method for inciting a reply, as in "It's nice here, eh?" (instead of "It's nice here, right?") In North America, it is most commonly associated with Canada and Canadian English, and with Michigan's Upper Peninsula.  Similar interjections exist in other languages, such as Dutch, Armenian, Hokkien Chinese, Japanese, French, Finnish, Italian, Greek, Hebrew, Malay, Spanish, Persian, Portuguese, Arabic, Turkish, Korean, Catalan and Filipino. 

Instant messaging<====>55951<====>Instant messaging  Instant messaging (IM) is a type of online chat that offers real-time text transmission over the Internet.  A LAN messenger operates in a similar way over a local area network.  Short messages are typically transmitted between two parties, when each user chooses to complete a thought and select "send".  Some IM applications can use push technology to provide real-time text, which transmits messages character by character, as they are composed.  More advanced instant messaging can add file transfer, clickable hyperlinks, Voice over IP, or video chat. Non-IM types of chat include multicast transmission, usually referred to as "chat rooms", where participants might be anonymous or might be previously known to each other (for example collaborators on a project that is using chat to facilitate communication). 

Version control<====>55955<====>Version control   A component of software configuration management, version control, also known as revision control or source control,    is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information.  Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the "revision number", "revision level", or simply "revision".  For example, an initial set of files is "revision 1".  When the first change is made, the resulting set is "revision 2", and so on.  Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. 

Politician<====>55959<====>Politician A politician is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government.  In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office.  In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues.  Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government.   Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people.  Broadly speaking, a "politician" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution. 

Chaco War<====>55961<====>Chaco War   The Chaco War (1932–1935;  ,   Mombe’uhára Paraguái ha Boliviaygua Jotopa III, Cháko Ñorairõ rehegua.  Secretaría Nacional de Cultura de Paraguay ) was fought between Bolivia and Paraguay over control of the northern part of the Gran Chaco region (known in Spanish as Chaco Boreal) of South America, which was thought to be rich in oil.  It is also referred to as La Guerra de la Sed (Spanish for "The War of Thirst") in literary circles, for being fought in the semi-arid Chaco.  It was the bloodiest military conflict fought in South America during the 20th century, between two of its poorest countries, both having previously lost territory to neighbors in 19th-century wars. 

Lennox Lewis<====>55964<====>Lennox Lewis  Lennox Claudius Lewis,  ,   (born 2 September 1965) is a former professional boxer who competed from 1989 to 2003.  He is a three-time world heavyweight champion, a two-time lineal champion, and remains the last heavyweight to hold the undisputed title.  Holding dual British and Canadian citizenship,    Lewis represented Canada as an amateur at the 1988 Summer Olympics, winning a gold medal in the super-heavyweight division after defeating future world champion Riddick Bowe in the final. In his first three years as a professional, Lewis won several regional heavyweight championships, including the European, British, and Commonwealth titles. 

Communication disorder<====>55967<====>Communication disorder A communication disorder is any disorder that affects an individual's ability to comprehend, detect, or apply language and speech to engage in discourse effectively with others.    The delays and disorders can range from simple sound substitution to the inability to understand or use one's native language.    DiagnosisDisorders and tendencies included and excluded under the category of communication disorders may vary by source.   For example, the definitions offered by the American Speech–Language–Hearing Association differ from that of the Diagnostic Statistical Manual 4th edition (DSM-IV). Gleanson (2001) defines a communication disorder as a speech and language disorder which refers to problems in communication and in related areas such as oral motor function. 

Inner ear<====>55971<====>Inner ear  The inner ear (internal ear, auris interna) is the innermost part of the vertebrate ear.  In vertebrates, the inner ear is mainly responsible for sound detection and balance.   In mammals, it consists of the bony labyrinth, a hollow cavity in the temporal bone of the skull with a system of passages comprising two main functional parts: The cochlea, dedicated to hearing; converting sound pressure patterns from the outer ear into electrochemical impulses which are passed on to the brain via the auditory nerve. The vestibular system, dedicated to balanceThe inner ear is found in all vertebrates, with substantial variations in form and function. 

Middle ear<====>55972<====>Middle ear  The middle ear is the portion of the ear internal to the eardrum, and external to the oval window of the inner ear.   The mammalian middle ear contains three ossicles, which transfer the vibrations of the eardrum into waves in the fluid and membranes of the inner ear.   The hollow space of the middle ear is also known as the tympanic cavity and is surrounded by the tympani bone.  The auditory tube (also known as the Eustachian tube or the pharyngotympanic tube) joins the tympanic cavity with the nasal cavity (nasopharynx), allowing pressure to equalize between the middle ear and throat. 

Outer ear<====>55973<====>Outer ear    The outer ear is the external portion of the ear, which consists of the auricle (also pinna) and the ear canal.  It gathers sound energy and focuses it on the eardrum (tympanic membrane). StructureAuricle The visible part is called the auricle, also known as the pinna, especially in other animals.  It is composed of a thin plate of yellow elastic cartilage, covered with integument, and connected to the surrounding parts by ligaments and muscles; and to the commencement of the ear canal by fibrous tissue.  Many mammals can move the pinna (with the auriculares muscles) in order to focus their hearing in a certain direction in much the same way that they can turn their eyes. 

Federal Communications Commission<====>55974<====>Federal Communications Commission    The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent agency of the United States government created by statute (  and  ) to regulate interstate  communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable.  The FCC works towards six goals in the areas of broadband, competition, the spectrum, the media, public safety and homeland security, and modernizing itself.    The FCC was formed by the Communications Act of 1934 to replace the radio regulation functions of the Federal Radio Commission.  The FCC took over wire communication regulation from the Interstate Commerce Commission. 

Makefile<====>55976<====>Makefile   A makefile is a file containing a set of directives used with the make build automation tool. OverviewMost often, the makefile directs make on how to compile and link a program.  Using C/C++ as an example, when a C/C++ source file is changed, it must be recompiled.  If a header file has changed, each C/C++ source file that includes the header file must be recompiled to be safe.  Each compilation produces an object file corresponding to the source file.  Finally, if any source file has been recompiled, all the object files, whether newly made or saved from previous compilations, must be linked together to produce the new executable program. 

Dirty bomb<====>55982<====>Dirty bomb   A dirty bomb or radiological dispersal device (RDD) is a speculative radiological weapon that combines radioactive material with conventional explosives.  The purpose of the weapon is to contaminate the area around the dispersal agent/conventional explosion with radioactive material, serving primarily as an area denial device against civilians.  It is however not to be confused with a nuclear explosion, such as a fission bomb, which by releasing nuclear energy produces blast effects far in excess of what is achievable by the use of conventional explosives. Though an RDD would be designed to disperse radioactive material over a large area, a bomb that uses conventional explosives and produces a blast wave would be far more lethal to people than the hazard posed by radioactive material that may be mixed with the explosive. 

Black rat<====>55983<====>Black ratThe black rat (Rattus rattus), also known as the ship rat, roof rat, house rat, is a common long-tailed rodent of the genus Rattus (rats) in the subfamily Murinae.   The species originated in tropical Asia and spread through the Near East in Roman times before reaching Europe by the 1st century and spreading with Europeans across the world.    Black rats are generalist omnivores.  They are serious pests to farmers as they eat a wide range of agricultural crops. TaxonomyThe black rat was one of the many species originally described by Linnaeus in his 18th century work, Systema Naturae, and it still bears its original tautonym of Rattus rattus. 

Xanana Gusmão<====>55986<====>Xanana Gusmão   Kay Rala Xanana Gusmão,  GColIH, GCL, GCMG  ( , born José Alexandre Gusmão,  , on 20 June 1946) is an East Timorese politician.  A former militant, he was the first President of East Timor, serving from May 2002 to May 2007.  He then became the fourth Prime Minister of East Timor, serving from 8 August 2007 "Gusmao sworn in as East Timor PM"  , Al Jazeera, 8 August 2007.   to 16 February 2015.  He has been Minister of Planning and Strategic Investment since February 2015. Early life and careerGusmão was born in Manatuto, in what was then Portuguese Timor, to parents of mixed Portuguese-Timorese ancestry, both of whom were school teachers. 

Tell Abu Hureyra<====>55988<====>Tell Abu Hureyra  Tell Abu Hureyra ( ) is an archaeological site in the Euphrates valley in modern Syria.  The remains of the villages within the tell come from over 4,000 years of pre-ceramic habitation spanning the Epipaleolithic and Neolithic periods.   Ancient Abu Hureyra was occupied between 13,000 and 9,000 years ago in radio carbon years.  The site is significant because the inhabitants of Abu Hureyra started out as hunter-gatherers, but gradually moved to farming, making them the earliest known farmers in the world.  History of researchThe site was excavated as a rescue operation before it was flooded by Lake Assad, the reservoir of the Tabqa Dam which was being built at that time. 

Tommy Cooper<====>55992<====>Tommy Cooper    Thomas Frederick Cooper (19 March 1921 – 15 April 1984) was a British prop comedian and magician.  He was a member of The Magic Circle, and was respected by traditional magicians.  He was famed for his red tarboosh, and his appearance was large and lumbering, at   and more than   in weight.   On 15 April 1984, Cooper collapsed with  a heart attack on live national television, and died soon afterwards. Early lifeThomas Frederick Cooper was born on 19 March 1921 at 19 Llwyn-On Street in Caerphilly, Glamorgan. 

Ménière's disease<====>55994<====>Ménière's disease    Ménière's disease (MD) is a disorder of the inner ear that is characterized by episodes of feeling like the world is spinning (vertigo), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), hearing loss, and a fullness in the ear.    Typically only one ear is affected, at least initially; however, over time both ears may become involved.   Episodes generally last from 20 minutes to a few hours.The time between episodes varies.   The hearing loss and ringing in the ears may become constant over time.   The cause of Ménière's disease is unclear but likely involves both genetic and environmental factors. 

K. M. Peyton<====>55995<====>K.  M.  Peyton  Kathleen Wendy Herald Peyton, MBE (born 2 August 1929), who writes primarily as K.  M.  Peyton, is a British author of fiction for children and young adults.  She has written more than fifty novels including the much loved "Flambards" series of stories about the Russell family which spanned the period before and after the First World War, for which she won both the 1969 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association  and the 1970 Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, judged by a panel of British children's writers.In 1979 the Flambards trilogy was adapted by Yorkshire Television  as a 13-part TV series, Flambards, starring Christine McKenna as the heroine Christina Parsons. 

Prosper Ménière<====>55998<====>Prosper Ménière Prosper Menière (18 June 1799 – 7 February 1862) was a French doctor who first identified a medical condition combining vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus, which is now known as Menière's disease. BiographyMenière was born in Angers, France.  During his education he excelled at humanities and classics.  He completed his medical studies at Hôtel-Dieu de Paris in 1826, and earned his M. D.  in 1828.  He then assisted Guillaume Dupuytren. Menière was originally set to be an assistant professor in faculty, but political tensions disturbed his professorship and he was sent to control the spread of cholera. 

Tongue<====>55999<====>Tongue  The tongue is a muscular organ in the mouth of most vertebrates that manipulates food for mastication, and is used in the act of swallowing.  It is of importance in the digestive system and is the primary organ of taste in the gustatory system.  The tongue's upper surface (dorsum) is covered by taste buds housed in numerous lingual papillae.  It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva, and is richly supplied with nerves and blood vessels.  The tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning the teeth.   A major function of the tongue is the enabling of speech in humans and vocalization in other animals. 

Conformance testing<====>56001<====>Conformance testing Conformance testing, or type testing, is testing to determine whether a product, system or just a medium complies with the requirements of a specification, contract or regulation.  That may apply to various technical terms as well as to pure formal terms with respect to obligations of the contractors.  Conformity assessment, also known as compliance assessment,is any activity to determine, directly or indirectly, that a process, product or service meets relevant technical standards and fulfills relevant requirements.  Conformity assessment activities may include:TestingSurveillanceInspectionAuditingCertificationAccreditationAdditionally, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) governs conformity assessment through the Agreement on Mutual Recognition in Relation to Conformity Assessment (Signed July 4, 2000)Testing is often either logical testing or physical testing.

Discrete space<====>56061<====>Discrete space In topology, a discrete space is a particularly simple example of a topological space or similar structure, one in which the points form a discontinuous sequence, meaning they are isolated from each other in a certain sense.  The discrete topology is the finest topology that can be given on a set, i. e. , it defines all subsets as open sets.  In particular, each singleton is an open set in the discrete topology. DefinitionsGiven a set X:the discrete topology on X is defined by letting every subset of X be open (and hence also closed), and X is a discrete topological space if it is equipped with its discrete topology;the discrete uniformity on X is defined by letting every superset of the diagonal {(x,x) : x is in X} in X × X be an entourage, and X is a discrete uniform space if it is equipped with its discrete uniformity. 

Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye<====>56075<====>Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye  The Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye is an American all-weather, carrier-capable tactical airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft.  This twin-turboprop aircraft was designed and developed during the late 1950s and early 1960s by the Grumman Aircraft Company for the United States Navy as a replacement for the earlier, piston-engined E-1 Tracer, which was rapidly becoming obsolete.  The aircraft's performance has been upgraded with the E-2B, and E-2C versions, where most of the changes were made to the radar and radio communications due to advances in electronic integrated circuits and other electronics.  The fourth major version of the Hawkeye is the E-2D, which first flew in 2007. 

Krull dimension<====>56079<====>Krull dimensionIn commutative algebra, the Krull dimension of a commutative ring R, named after Wolfgang Krull, is the supremum of the lengths of all chains of prime ideals.  The Krull dimension need not be finite even for a Noetherian ring.  More generally the Krull dimension can be defined for modules over possibly non-commutative rings as the deviation of the poset of submodules. The Krull dimension has been introduced to provide an algebraic definition of the dimension of an algebraic variety: the dimension of the affine variety defined by an ideal I in a polynomial ring R is the Krull dimension of R/I. 

Japanese school uniform<====>56085<====>Japanese school uniform  The Japanese school uniform is modeled in appearance similar to that of the European-style naval uniforms and was first used in Japan in the late 19th century, replacing the traditional kimono.Today, school uniforms are common in many of the Japanese public and private school systems.  The Japanese word for this type of uniform is  . HistoryThe gakuran and sailor-style dress have always been a part of Japan's "growing modern" culture due to it appearing formal and has existed as a concept.  An official from Tombow Co. , a manufacturer of the sailor fuku (sailor outfits), said that the Japanese took the idea from scaled down sailor suits worn by children of royal European families. 

Territorial dispute<====>56086<====>Territorial dispute A territorial dispute is a disagreement over the possession/control of land between two or more territorial entities or over the possession or control of land, usually between a new state and the occupying power. Context and definitionsTerritorial disputes are often related to the possession of natural resources such as rivers, fertile farmland, mineral or oil resources although the disputes can also be driven by culture, religion and ethnic nationalism.  Territorial disputes result often from vague and unclear language in a treaty that set up the original boundary. Territorial disputes are a major cause of wars and terrorism as states often try to assert their sovereignty over a territory through invasion, and non-state entities try to influence the actions of politicians through terrorism. 

Trieste<====>56092<====>Trieste   Trieste ( ;;  ) is a city and a seaport in northeastern Italy.  It is situated towards the end of a narrow strip of Italian territory lying between the Adriatic Sea and Slovenia, which lies almost immediately south and east of the city.  It is also located near Croatia some further   south.  Trieste is located at the head of the Gulf of Trieste and throughout history it has been influenced by its location at the crossroads of Latin, Slavic, and Germanic cultures.  In 2009, it had a population of about 205,000    and it is the capital of the autonomous region Friuli-Venezia Giulia. 

Kerchief<====>56093<====>Kerchief  A kerchief (from the French couvre-chef, "head cover") also known as a bandana or bandanna, is a triangular or square piece of cloth tied around the head or around the neck for protective or decorative purposes.  The popularity of head kerchiefs may vary by culture or religion, as among Orthodox Jewish and Christian, Catholic, Amish, and Muslim women.  It is also worn as headdresses by Malay men in traditional occasions such as weddings by the grooms and the pesilat.  Their headdresses are better known as tengkolok. The neckerchief and handkerchief are related items of clothing or accessories. 

Pioneer movement<====>56096<====>Pioneer movement  A pioneer movement is an organization for children operated by a communist party.  Typically children enter into the organization in elementary school and continue until adolescence.  The adolescents then typically join the Young Communist League.  Prior to the 1990s there was a wide cooperation between pioneer and similar movements of about 30 countries, coordinated by the international organization, International Committee of Children's and Adolescents' Movements ( , CIMEA), founded in 1958, with headquarters in Budapest. OverviewPioneer movements exist in countries where the Communist Party is in power as well as in some countries where the Communist Party is in opposition, if the party is large enough to support a children's organization. 

History of Styria<====>56097<====>History of Styria  The history of Styria concerns the region roughly corresponding to the modern Austrian state of Styria and the Slovene region of Styria (Štajerska) from its settlement by Germans and Slavs in the Dark Ages until the present.  This mountainous and scenic region, which became a centre for mountaineering in the 19th century, is often called the "Green March", because half of the area is covered with forests and one quarter with meadows, grasslands, vineyards and orchards.  Styria is also rich in minerals, soft coal and iron, which has been mined at Erzberg since the time of the Romans. 

Monte Carlo method<====>56098<====>Monte Carlo method Monte Carlo methods (or Monte Carlo experiments) are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results.  Their essential idea is using randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle.  They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches.  Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three distinct problem classes:  optimization, numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution. In physics-related problems, Monte Carlo methods are useful for simulating systems with many coupled degrees of freedom, such as fluids, disordered materials, strongly coupled solids, and cellular structures (see cellular Potts model, interacting particle systems, McKean-Vlasov processes, kinetic models of gases). 

Red dwarf<====>56099<====>Red dwarf   A red dwarf is a small and relatively cool star on the main sequence, of M spectral type.  Red dwarfs range in mass from a low of 0. 075 to about 0. 50 solar mass and have a surface temperature of less than 4,000 K.  Sometimes K-type main-sequence stars, with masses between 0. 50-0. 8 solar mass, are also included. Red dwarfs are by far the most common type of star in the Milky Way, at least in the neighborhood of the Sun, but because of their low luminosity, individual red dwarfs cannot be easily observed. 

Ouagadougou<====>56100<====>Ouagadougou  Ouagadougou ( ;  ; Mossi:  ), also known as Wagadugu, is the capital of Burkina Faso and the administrative, communications, cultural, and economic centre of the nation.  It is also the country's largest city, with a population of 1,475,223 ( ).  National 2006 census final results    The city's name is often shortened to Ouaga.  The inhabitants are called ouagalais.  The spelling of the name Ouagadougou is derived from the French orthography common in former French African colonies. Ouagadougou's primary industries are food processing and textiles.  It is served by an international airport and it is linked by rail to Abidjan in the Ivory Coast. 

Ethnic conflict<====>56101<====>Ethnic conflict  An ethnic conflict is a conflict between two or more contending ethnic groups.   While the source of the conflict may be political, social, economic or religious, the individuals in conflict must expressly fight for their ethnic group's position within society.  This final criterion differentiates ethnic conflict from other forms of struggle.   Ethnic conflict does not necessarily have to be violent.  In a multi-ethnic society where freedom of speech is protected, ethnic conflict can be an everyday feature of plural democracies.  For example, ethnic conflict might be a non-violent struggle for resources divided among ethnic groups. 

Manneken Pis<====>56102<====>Manneken Pis   Manneken Pis ( , meaning "Little man Pee" in Dutch) is a landmark small bronze sculpture (61 cm)  in Brussels, depicting a naked little boy urinating into a fountain's basin.  It was designed by   and put in place in 1618 or 1619.   The current statue dates from 1965.Manneken Pis is the best-known symbol of the people of Brussels.  It also embodies their sense of humour (called zwanze in the Brussels' dialect) and their independence of mind. EtymologyTo be precise, the real name of the statue is Menneke Pis. 

Stevie Smith<====>56103<====>Stevie Smith    Florence Margaret Smith, known as Stevie Smith (20 September 1902 – 7 March 1971), was an English poet and novelist. LifeStevie Smith, born Florence Margaret Smith in Kingston upon Hull, was the second daughter of Ethel and Charles Smith.  (Couzyn, Jeni 1985) Contemporary Women Poets.  Bloodaxe, p.  32.   She was called "Peggy" within her family, but acquired the name "Stevie" as a young woman when she was riding in the park with a friend who said that she reminded him of the jockey Steve Donoghue. Her father was a shipping agent, a business that he had inherited from his father. 

Wildfire<====>56106<====>Wildfire A wildfire or wildland fire is a fire in an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area.Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire.Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago.   Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna. 

Metropolis–Hastings algorithm<====>56107<====>Metropolis–Hastings algorithmIn statistics and in statistical physics, the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for obtaining a sequence of random samples from a probability distribution for which direct sampling is difficult.  This sequence can be used to approximate the distribution (e. g. , to generate a histogram), or to compute an integral (such as an expected value).   Metropolis–Hastings and other MCMC algorithms are generally used for sampling from multi-dimensional distributions, especially when the number of dimensions is high.   For single-dimensional distributions, other methods are usually available (e. g.  adaptive rejection sampling) that can directly return independent samples from the distribution, and are free from the problem of autocorrelated samples that is inherent in MCMC methods. 

Penrose triangle<====>56108<====>Penrose triangle The Penrose triangle, also known as the Penrose tribar, or the impossible tribar,  is a triangular impossible object.  It was first created by the Swedish artist Oscar Reutersvärd in 1934.  The psychiatrist Lionel Penrose and his mathematician son Roger Penrose independently devised and popularized it in the 1950s, describing it as "impossibility in its purest form".  It is featured prominently in the works of artist M.  C.  Escher, whose earlier depictions of impossible objects partly inspired it. Impossible objectThe tribar appears to be a solid object, made of three straight beams of square cross-section which meet pairwise at right angles at the vertices of the triangle they form. 

Brown rat<====>56109<====>Brown rat   The Brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), also referred to as the common rat, street rat, sewer rat, Hanover rat, Norway rat, Norwegian rat, or wharf rat is one of the best known and most common rats. One of the largest muroids, it is a brown or grey rodent with a body up to   long, and a similar tail length; the male weighs on average   and the female  .  Thought to have originated in northern China, this rodent has now spread to all continents except Antarctica, and is the dominant rat in Europe and much of North America—making it by at least this particular definition the most successful mammal on the planet alongside humans. 

Impossible object<====>56110<====>Impossible object An impossible object (also known as an impossible figure or an undecidable figure) is a type of optical illusion.  It consists of a two-dimensional figure which is instantly and subconsciously interpreted by the visual system as representing a projection of a three-dimensional object. In most cases the impossibility becomes apparent after viewing the figure for a few seconds.  However, the initial impression of a 3D object remains even after it has been contradicted.  There are also more subtle examples of impossible objects where the impossibility does not become apparent spontaneously and it is necessary to consciously examine the geometry of the implied object to determine that it is impossible. 

David Stirling<====>56111<====>David Stirling  Colonel Sir Archibald David Stirling   (15 November 1915 – 4 November 1990) was a Scottish officer in the British Army, mountaineer, and the founder of the Special Air Service.  He saw active service during the Second World War. Life before the warStirling was born at his family's ancestral home, Keir House in the parish of Lecropt, Perthshire.  He was the son of Brigadier General Archibald Stirling, of Keir, and Margaret Fraser, daughter of Simon Fraser, the Lord Lovat, (a descendant of Charles II, King of Scots), and thus Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat was a first cousin. 

Necker cube<====>56112<====>Necker cube The Necker cube is an optical illusion first published as a rhomboid in 1832 by Swiss crystallographer Louis Albert Necker.   It is a simple wire-frame drawing of a cube with no visual cues as to its orientation, so it can be interpreted to have either the lower-left or the upper-right square as its front side.  Necker cube is used in studies of human visual perception. Ambiguity The Necker cube is an ambiguous line drawing. The effect is interesting because each part of the picture is ambiguous by itself, yet the human visual system picks an interpretation of each part that makes the whole consistent. 

Urbanization<====>56114<====>Urbanization   Urbanization refers to the population shift from rural to urban areas, "the gradual increase in the proportion of people living in urban areas", and the ways in which each society adapts to the change.   It is predominantly the process by which towns and cities are formed and become larger as more people begin living and working in central areas.   The United Nations projected that half of the world's population would live in urban areas at the end of 2008.   It is predicted that by 2050 about 64% of the developing world and 86% of the developed world will be urbanized. 

Salting the earth<====>56116<====>Salting the earth  Salting the earth, or sowing with salt, is the ritual of spreading salt on conquered cities to symbolize a curse on their re-inhabitation.   Gevirtz, 1963.   It originated as a symbolic practice in the ancient Near East and became a well-established folkloric motif in the Middle Ages.   Although concentrated salt is toxic to most crops, there is no evidence that sufficient salt has been applied to render large tracts of land unusable.  Destroying citiesThe custom of purifying or consecrating a destroyed city with salt and cursing anyone who dared to rebuild it was widespread in the ancient Near East, but historical accounts are unclear as to what the sowing of salt meant in that process. 

Shareholder rights plan<====>56117<====>Shareholder rights plan A shareholder rights plan, colloquially known as a "poison pill", is a type of defensive tactic used by a corporation's board of directors against a takeover.  Typically, such a plan gives shareholders the right to buy more shares at a discount if one shareholder buys a certain percentage or more of the company's shares.  The plan could be triggered, for instance, if any one shareholder buys 20% of the company's shares, at which point every shareholder (except the one who possesses 20%) will have the right to buy a new issue of shares at a discount. 

Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico<====>56118<====>Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico  Tierra Amarilla is a small unincorporated community near the Carson National Forest in the northern part of the U. S.  state of New Mexico.   It is the county seat of Rio Arriba County.    Tierra Amarilla is Spanish for "Yellow Soil".  The name refers to clay deposits found in the Chama River Valley and used by Native American peoples.Tewa and Navajo toponyms for the area also refer to the yellow clay.   HistoryThere is evidence of 5000 years of habitation in the Chama River Valley including pueblo sites south of Abiquiu. 

Takeover<====>56119<====>Takeover  In business, a takeover is the purchase of one company (the target) by another (the acquirer, or bidder).  In the UK, the term refers to the acquisition of a public company whose shares are listed on a stock exchange, in contrast to the acquisition of a private company. Management of the target company may or may not agree with a proposed takeover, this has resulted in the following takeover classifications; friendly, hostile, reverse or back-flip.Financing a takeover often involves loans or bond issues which may include junk bonds.   As well as a simple cash offers, it can also include shares in the new company. 

Hispanic<====>56120<====>Hispanic The term Hispanic (  or  ) broadly refers to the people, nations, and cultures that have a historical link to Spain.  It commonly applies to countries once owned by the Spanish Empire in the Americas (see Spanish colonization of the Americas) and Asia, particularly the countries of Hispanic America and the Philippines.  It could be argued that the term should apply to all Spanish-speaking cultures or countries, as the historical roots of the word specifically pertain to the Iberian region.  It is difficult to label a nation or culture with one term, such as Hispanic, as the ethnicities, customs, traditions, and art forms (music, literature, dress, culture, cuisine, and others) vary greatly by country and region. 

Market liquidity<====>56121<====>Market liquidity In business, economics or investment, market liquidity is a market's ability to purchase or sell an asset without causing drastic change in the asset's price.  Equivalently, an asset's market liquidity (or simply "an asset's liquidity") describes the asset's ability to sell quickly without having to reduce its price to a significant degree.  Liquidity is about how big the trade-off is between the speed of the sale and the price it can be sold for.  In a liquid market, the trade-off is mild: selling quickly will not reduce the price much.  In a relatively illiquid market, selling it quickly will require cutting its price by some amount. 

Sorghum<====>56122<====>Sorghum   Sorghum is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae.  Seventeen of the twenty-five species are native to Australia,  with the range of some extending to Africa, Asia, Mesoamerica, and certain islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.  One species is grown for grain, while many others are used as fodder plants, either cultivated in warm climates worldwide or naturalized, in pasture lands.   Sorghum is in the subfamily Panicoideae and the tribe Andropogoneae (the tribe of big bluestem and sugarcane). Cultivation and usesOne species, Sorghum bicolor,  native to Africa with many cultivated forms now,  is an important crop worldwide, used for food (as grain and in sorghum syrup or "sorghum molasses"), animal fodder, the production of alcoholic beverages, and biofuels.

Lakota Language Consortium.and Teton Sioux.  They speak the Lakota language, the westernmost of the three closely related languages that belong to the Siouan language family, occupying lands in both North and South Dakota.  According to some historical sources the Lakota were at one point in their history part of a confederation of seven related Sioux tribes, the Očhéthi Šakówiŋ or Seven Council Fires, and as such are one of the Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains of North America. 

Sioux<====>56125<====>Sioux   The Sioux   also known as Dakota, are groups of Native American tribes and First Nations peoples in North America.  The term can refer to any ethnic group within the Great Sioux Nation or to any of the nation's many language dialects.  The Sioux comprise three major divisions based on language divisions: the Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota. The Santee Dakota (Isáŋyathi; "Knife") reside in the extreme east of the Dakotas, Minnesota and northern Iowa.  The Yankton and Yanktonai Dakota (Iháŋktȟuŋwaŋ and Iháŋktȟuŋwaŋna; "Village-at-the-end" and "Little village-at-the-end"), collectively also referred to by the endonym Wičhíyena, reside in the Minnesota River area. 

Battle of the Little Bighorn<====>56126<====>Battle of the Little Bighorn  The Battle of the Little Bighorn, known to the Lakota and other Plains Indians as the Battle of the Greasy Grass  and also commonly referred to as Custer's Last Stand, was an armed engagement between combined forces of the Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho tribes and the 7th Cavalry Regiment of the United States Army.  The battle, which resulted in the defeat of US forces, was the most significant action of the Great Sioux War of 1876.  It took place on June 25–26, 1876, along the Little Bighorn River in the Crow Indian Reservation in southeastern Montana Territory.

Today, the Cheyenne people are split into two federally recognized Nations: the Southern Cheyenne, who are enrolled in the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes in Oklahoma, and the Northern Cheyenne, who are enrolled in the Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in Montana. 

Noetherian ring<====>56129<====>Noetherian ringIn mathematics, more specifically in the area of abstract algebra known as ring theory, a Noetherian ring is a ring that satisfies the ascending chain condition on ideals; that is, given any chain of ideals: I_1\subseteq\cdots \subseteq I_{k-1}\subseteq I_{k}\subseteq I_{k+1}\subseteq\cdots there exists an n such that: I_{n}=I_{n+1}=\cdots.  There are other equivalent formulations of the definition of a Noetherian ring and these are outlined later in the article.  Noetherian rings are named after Emmy Noether.   The notion of a Noetherian ring is of fundamental importance in both commutative and noncommutative ring theory, due to the role it plays in simplifying the ideal structure of a ring.

S.  state.  New Jersey does not have an official state song, while Virginia's previous state song, "Carry Me Back to Old Virginny", adopted in 1940,    was rescinded due to its racist language by the Virginia General Assembly.In 2015, "Our Great Virginia" was made the new state song of Virginia. 

Touchstone (assaying tool)<====>56135<====>Touchstone (assaying tool) A touchstone is a small tablet of dark stone such as fieldstone, slate, or lydite, used for assaying precious metal alloys.  It has a finely grained surface on which soft metals leave a visible trace.  HistoryThe touchstone was used in ancient Greece.   It was also used by the Indus Valley Civilization about 3500 BC for testing the purity of soft metals. OperationDrawing a line with gold on a touchstone will leave a visible trace.  Because different alloys of gold have different colours (see gold) the unknown sample can be compared to samples of known purity.

Butanol<====>56139<====>ButanolButanol (also called butyl alcohol) is a four-carbon alcohol with a formula of C 4 H 9 OH, which occurs in five isomeric structures, from a straight-chain primary alcohol to a branched-chain tertiary alcohol;  all are a butyl or isobutyl group linked to a hydroxyl group (sometimes represented as BuOH, n-BuOH, and i-BuOH).  These are n-butanol, 2 stereoisomers of 2-butanol, tert-butanol, and isobutanol.  Butanol is primarily used as a solvent, as an intermediate in chemical synthesis, and as a fuel.  It is sometimes also called biobutanol when produced biologically. IsomersThe unmodified term butanol usually refers to the straight chain isomer with the alcohol functional group at the terminal carbon, which is also known as n-butanol or 1-butanol. 

History of Norway<====>56140<====>History of Norway The history of Norway has been influenced to an extraordinary degree by the terrain and the climate of the region.  About 10,000 BC, following the retreat of the great inland ice sheets, the earliest inhabitants migrated north into the territory which is now Norway.  They traveled steadily northwards along the coastal areas, warmed by the Gulf Stream, where life was more bearable.  In order to survive they fished and hunted reindeer (and other prey).  Between 5,000 BC and 4,000 BC the earliest agricultural settlements appeared around the Oslofjord.  Gradually, between 1500 BC and 500 BC, these agricultural settlements spread into the southern areas of Norway - whilst the inhabitants of the northern regions continued to hunt and fish.

In the Bible, Nimrod is considered the creator of the Tower of Babel, and King Solomon built Solomon's Temple with the assistance of the architect Hiram. In Hinduism, the palaces of the gods were built by the architect and artisan Vivasvat. Moreover, Indian epic Mahabharata cites amazing work by architect 'Maya.'Architects also occur in modern fiction.  Examples include Howard Roark, protagonist in Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead; Bloody Stupid Johnson, a parody of Capability Brown who appears in Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels; and Slartibartfast, designer of planets in Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  Basil Al Bayati's novel The Age of Metaphors on the theme of Metaphoric Architecture is also replete with fictional architects.  The main characters of Sa'ad, Shiymaa and Sa'im are all architects, as are a number of others who appear throughout the book.Many films have included central characters who are architects, including Henry Fonda's character "Juror 8" (Davis) in 12 Angry Men (1957), Tom Hanks's character in Sleepless in Seattle (1993), David Strathairn's character in The River Wild (1994), Michael J. Fox's character in The Frighteners (1996), John Cassavetes's character in Tempest (1982), Michael Keaton's character in White Noise (2005) and Jeremy Irons' character in High-Rise (2015).In television, Mike Brady, father of The Brady Bunch, is an architect; as is Wilbur Post, owner of Mister Ed; and Ted Mosby, from How I Met Your Mother. The character George Costanza pretends to be an architect named "Art Vandelay" in Seinfeld. Architect Halvard Solness is the protagonist of Henrick Ibsen's 1892 play The Master Builder.Lists of architects by country See also List of architects of supertall buildingsList of architectural historiansList of architecture firmsList of women architects Further readingSteele, James (1997).

Starship<====>56163<====>Starship A starship, starcraft or interstellar spacecraft is a theoretical spacecraft designed for traveling between planetary systems,  as opposed to an aerospace-vehicle designed for orbital spaceflight or interplanetary travel. The term is mostly found in science fiction, because such craft have never been constructed.   Reference to a "star-ship" appears as early as 1882 in Oahspe: A New Bible (1882).   Whilst the Voyager and Pioneer probes have travelled into local interstellar space, the purpose of these unmanned craft was specifically interplanetary and they are not predicted to reach another star system (although Voyager 1 will travel to within 1. 

Languages in Star Wars<====>56166<====>Languages in Star WarsDISPLAYTITLE The Star Wars science fiction universe, created by George Lucas, features dialogue that is not spoken in natural languages.  The lingua franca of the franchise, for which the language the works are dubbed or written stand in, is Galactic Basic.  Characters often speak languages other than Basic, notably Shyriiwook spoken by Chewbacca, droidspeak spoken by R2-D2 and BB-8, and Huttese spoken by Jabba the Hutt. The fictional languages were approached as sound design and developed largely by Ben Burtt, sound designer for both the original and prequel trilogy of films.  He created alien dialogue out of the sounds of primarily non-English languages, such as Quechua, Haya, and Tibetan.

Interlaced video<====>56189<====>Interlaced video  Interlaced video is a technique for doubling the perceived frame rate of a video display without consuming extra bandwidth.  The interlaced signal contains two fields of a video frame captured at two different times.  This enhances motion perception to the viewer, and reduces flicker by taking advantage of the phi phenomenon. This effectively doubles the time resolution (also called temporal resolution) as compared to non-interlaced footage (for frame rates equal to field rates).  Interlaced signals require a display that is natively capable of showing the individual fields in a sequential order.  CRT displays and ALiS plasma displays are made for displaying interlaced signals. 

Fifth Estate (periodical)<====>56190<====>Fifth Estate (periodical) Fifth Estate (FE) is a U. S.  periodical, based in Detroit, Michigan, begun in 1965, but with staff members across North America who connect via the Internet.  Its editorial collective sometimes has divergent views on the topics the magazine addresses but generally shares anarchist, anti-authoritarian outlook and a non-dogmatic, action-oriented approach to change.  The title implies that the periodical is an alternative to the fourth estate (traditional print journalism). Fifth Estate is frequently cited as the longest running English language anarchist publication in North America, although this is sometimes disputed since it became only explicitly anti-authoritarian in 1975 after ten years of publishing as part of the 1960s Underground Press movement.

Crop circle<====>56206<====>Crop circle    A crop circle or crop formation is a pattern created by flattening a crop,  usually a cereal.  The term was first coined in the early 1980s by Colin Andrews.   Crop circles have been described as all falling "within the range of the sort of thing done in hoaxes" by Taner Edis, professor of physics at Truman State University.   Although obscure natural causes or alien origins of crop circles are suggested by fringe theorists,    there is no scientific evidence for such explanations, and all crop circles are consistent with human causation. 

VT100<====>56207<====>VT100   The VT100 is a video terminal, introduced in August 1978 by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC).  It was one of the first terminals to support ANSI escape codes for cursor control and other tasks, and added a number of extended codes for special features like controlling the status lights on the keyboard.  This led to rapid uptake of the ANSI standard, becoming the de facto standard for terminal emulators. The VT100s, especially the VT102, was extremely successful in the market, and made DEC the leading terminal vendor.  The VT100 series was replaced by the VT200 series starting in 1983, which proved just as successful. 

Meteor Crater<====>56208<====>Meteor Crater    Meteor Crater is a meteorite impact crater approximately    east of Flagstaff and   west of Winslow in the northern Arizona desert of the United States.  Because the United States Board on Geographic Names commonly recognizes names of natural features derived from the nearest post office, the feature acquired the name of "Meteor Crater" from the nearby post office named Meteor.   The site was formerly known as the Canyon Diablo Crater and fragments of the meteorite are officially called the Canyon Diablo Meteorite.   Scientists refer to the crater as Barringer Crater in honor of Daniel Barringer, who was first to suggest that it was produced by meteorite impact.

Linen<====>56212<====>Linen Linen   is a textile made from the fibers of the flax plant.  Linen is  laborious to manufacture, but the fiber is very absorbent and garments made of linen are valued for their exceptional coolness and freshness in hot weather. Many products are made of linen: aprons, bags, towels (swimming, bath, beach, body and wash towels), napkins, bed linens, tablecloths, runners, chair covers, and men's and women's wear. The word linen is of West Germanic origin and cognate to  the Latin name for the flax plant, linum, and the earlier Greek λινόν (linón).  This word history has given rise to a number of other terms in English, most notably line, from the use of a linen (flax) thread to determine a straight line. 

Surcoat<====>56214<====>SurcoatA surcoat or surcote initially was an outer garment commonly worn in the Middle Ages by both men and women in Western Europe.  It can either refer to a coat worn over other clothes or the outermost garment itself.  The name derives from French meaning "over the coat", a long, loose, often sleeveless coat reaching down to the feet.  HistoryMen's surcoatFrom about the 12th century, knights wore long, flowing surcoats, frequently emblazoned with their personal arms, over their armor.  These usually extended to about midcalf, had slits in the bottom front and back, thus allowing the wearer to ride comfortably and were either sleeved or sleeveless.

The term technical describing such a vehicle originated in Somalia in the early 1990s.  Barred from bringing in private security, non-governmental organizations hired local gunmen to protect their personnel, using money defined as "technical assistance grants".  Eventually the term broadened to include any vehicle carrying armed men. 

Poaceae<====>56217<====>Poaceae   Poaceae or Gramineae is a large and nearly ubiquitous family of monocotyledonous flowering plants known as grasses.   Poaceae includes the cereal grasses, bamboos and the grasses of natural grassland and cultivated lawns and pasture.  Grasses have stems that are hollow except at the nodes and narrow alternate leaves borne in two ranks.  The lower part of each leaf encloses the stem, forming a leaf-sheath.  With around 780 genera and around 12,000 species,    Poaceae are the fifth-largest plant family, following the Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae.    Grasslands such as savannah and prairie where grasses are dominant are estimated to constitute 40. 

Piltdown Man<====>56223<====>Piltdown Man   The Piltdown Man was a paleoanthropological hoax in which bone fragments were presented as the fossilised remains of a previously unknown early human. In 1912, the amateur archaeologist Charles Dawson claimed that he had discovered the "missing link" between ape and man.  After finding a section of a human-like skull in Pleistocene gravel beds near Piltdown, East Sussex, Dawson contacted Arthur Smith Woodward, Keeper of Geology at the Natural History Museum.  Dawson and Smith Woodward discovered more bones and artifacts at the site, which they connected to the same individual.  These included a jawbone, more skull fragments, a set of teeth, and primitive tools. 

Oersted<====>56225<====>Oersted  The oersted (symbol Oe) is the unit of the auxiliary magnetic field H in the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS).  It is equivalent to 1 dyne per maxwell. Difference between CGS and SI systemsIn the CGS system, the unit of the H-field is the oersted and the unit of the B‑field is the gauss.  In the SI system, the unit ampere per meter (A/m), which is equivalent to newton/weber, is used for the H‑field and the unit of tesla is used for the B‑field.  HistoryThe unit was established by the IEC in 1930   in honour of the Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted. 

Electrum<====>56226<====>Electrum   Electrum is a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver, with trace amounts of copper and other metals.  It has also been produced artificially, and is often known as green gold.  The ancient Greeks called it 'gold' or 'white gold', as opposed to 'refined gold'.  Its colour ranges from pale to bright yellow, depending on the proportions of gold and silver. The gold content of naturally occurring electrum in modern Western Anatolia ranges from 70% to 90%, in contrast to the 45–55% of gold in electrum used in ancient Lydian coinage of the same geographical area. 

Skin tag<====>56227<====>Skin tag   A skin tag is a small benign tumor that forms primarily in areas where the skin forms creases, such as the neck, armpit, and groin.  They may also occur on the face, usually on the eyelids.  Perianal skin tags can be associated with Crohn's disease.   Acrochorda are generally harmless and painless, and usually do not grow or change over time.   Though tags up to a half-inch long have been seen, "Cutaneous skin tag".  Medline Plus.

Dairy<====>56228<====>Dairy A dairy is a business enterprise established for the harvesting or processing (or both) of animal milk – mostly from cows or goats, but also from buffaloes, sheep, horses, or camels – for human consumption.  A dairy is typically located on a dedicated dairy farm or in a section of a multi-purpose farm (mixed farm) that is concerned with the harvesting of milk. Terminology differs between countries.  For example, in the United States, an entire dairy farm is commonly called a "dairy".  The building or farm area where milk is harvested from the cow is often called a "milking parlor" or "parlor". 

Cichlid<====>56230<====>Cichlid  Cichlids   are fish from the family Cichlidae in the order Perciformes.  Cichlids are members of a suborder known as Labroidei, along with the wrasses (Labridae), damselfishes (Pomacentridae), and surfperches (Embiotocidae).   This family is both large and diverse.  At least 1,650 species have been scientifically described,  making it one of the largest vertebrate families.   New species are discovered annually, and many species remain undescribed.  The actual number of species is therefore unknown, with estimates varying between 2,000 and 3,000.   Cichlids are popular freshwater fish kept in the home aquarium. 

Governor<====>56231<====>Governor  A governor is, in most cases, a public official with the power to govern the executive branch of a non-sovereign or sub-national level of government, ranking under the head of state.   In federations, governor may be the title of a politician who governs a constituent state and may be either appointed or elected.  The power of the individual governor can vary dramatically between political systems, with some governors having only nominal or largely ceremonial power, while others having a complete control over the entire government. Historically, the title can also apply to the executive officials acting as representatives of a chartered company which has been granted exercise of sovereignty in a colonial area, such as the British East India Company or the Dutch East India Company. 

Flour<====>56232<====>Flour   Flour is a substance, generally a powder, made by grinding raw grains or roots and used to make many different foods.  Cereal flour is the main ingredient of bread, which is a staple food for many cultures.  Wheat flour is one of the most important ingredients in Oceanic, European, South American, North American, Middle Eastern, North Indian and North African cultures, and is the defining ingredient in their styles of breads and pastries. Wheat is the most common base for flour.  Corn flour has been important in Mesoamerican cuisine since ancient times and remains a staple in the Americas. 

Acrylamide<====>56239<====>Acrylamide Acrylamide (or acrylic amide) is a chemical compound with the chemical formula C 3 H 5 NO.  Its IUPAC name is prop-2-enamide.  It is a white odorless crystalline solid, soluble in water, ethanol, ether, and chloroform.  Acrylamide decomposes in the presence of acids, bases, oxidizing agents, iron, and iron salts.   It decomposes non-thermally to form ammonia, and thermal decomposition produces carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen. Acrylamide can be prepared by the hydrolysis of acrylonitrile by nitrile hydratase.  In industry, most acrylamide is used to synthesize polyacrylamides, which find many uses as water-soluble thickeners. 

Premier<====>56241<====>Premier   Premier is a title for the head of government in some countries, states and sub-national governments.  A second in command to a premier is designated as a vice-premier or deputy premier. Examples by countryIn many nations, "premier" is used interchangeably with "prime minister". In the People's Republic of China, "premier" is more common and official, but "prime minister" is still used (see Premier of the People's Republic of China). In five of the British overseas territories (Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the British Virgin Islands), the elected heads of government are styled as "Premier". 

Ixtab<====>56243<====>IxtabAt the time of the Spanish conquest of Yucatán (1527-1546), Ix Tab, or Ixtab ([iʃˈtaɓ], 'Woman whose work involves the use of a rope'), was the indigenous Mayan goddess of suicide by hanging.  Playing the role of a psychopomp, she would accompany such suicides to heaven.  No certain depictions of Ixtab are known.  SourcesThe only description of the goddess occurs in the so-called ‘Relación’ of the 16th-century Spanish inquisitor, Diego de Landa.  The passage runs as follows: “They said also and held it as absolutely certain that those who hanged themselves went to this heaven of theirs; and on this account, there were many persons who on slight occasions of sorrows, troubles or sickness, hanged themselves in order to escape these things and to go and rest in their heaven [gloria], where they said that the goddess of the gallows [la diosa de la horca], whom they called Ix Tab, would bring them. 

Antonio Gramsci<====>56244<====>Antonio Gramsci   Antonio Francesco Gramsci ( ,  ; 22 January 1891 – 27 April 1937) was an Italian Marxist philosopher and politician.  He wrote on political theory, sociology and linguistics.  He attempted to break from the economic determinism of traditional Marxist thought and so is considered a key neo-Marxist.   He was a founding member and one-time leader of the Communist Party of Italy and was imprisoned by Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime. He wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment.  His Prison Notebooks are considered a highly original contribution to 20th century political theory. 

York Rite<====>56250<====>York Rite The York Rite (sometimes referred to as the American Rite)    is one of several Rites of Freemasonry.  A Rite is a series of progressive degrees that are conferred by various Masonic organizations or bodies, each of which operates under the control of its own central authority.  The York Rite specifically is a collection of separate Masonic Bodies and associated Degrees that would otherwise operate independently.  The three primary bodies in the York Rite are the Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, Council of Royal & Select Masters or Council of Cryptic Masons, and the Commandery of Knights Templar, each of which are governed independently but are all considered to be a part of the York Rite. 

Harald Fairhair<====>56251<====>Harald Fairhair Harald Fairhair (Old Norse: Haraldr Hárfagri, Norwegian: Harald Hårfagre, (literally "Harald Fair-hair") ;   850 –   932) is remembered by medieval historians as the first King of Norway.  According to traditions current in Norway and Iceland in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, he reigned from   872 to 930.  Most of his life remains uncertain, since the extant accounts of his life in the sagas were set down in writing around three centuries after his lifetime.  A few remnants of skaldic praise poems attributed to contemporary court poets exist which seem to refer to Harald's victories against opponents in Norway. 

Lieutenant governor<====>56252<====>Lieutenant governorA lieutenant governor, lieutenant-governor, or vice governor is a high officer of state, whose precise role and rank vary by jurisdiction.

Dyadic rational<====>56263<====>Dyadic rationalIn mathematics, a dyadic fraction or dyadic rational is a rational number whose denominator, when the ratio is in minimal (coprime) terms, is a power of two, i. e. , a number of the form  \frac{a}{2^b}  where a is an integer and b is a natural number; for example, 1/2 or 3/8, but not 1/3.  These are precisely the numbers whose binary expansion is finite. Use in measurementThe inch is customarily subdivided in dyadic rather than decimal fractions; similarly, the customary divisions of the gallon into half-gallons, quarts, and pints are dyadic.  The ancient Egyptians also used dyadic fractions in measurement, with denominators up to 64. 

Thymus<====>56265<====>Thymus  The thymus is a specialized primary lymphoid organ of the immune system.  Within the thymus, T cells mature.  T cells are critical to the adaptive immune system, where the body adapts specifically to foreign invaders.  The thymus is composed of two identical lobes and is located anatomically in the anterior superior mediastinum, in front of the heart and behind the sternum.  Histologically, each lobe of the thymus can be divided into a central medulla and a peripheral cortex which is surrounded by an outer capsule.  The cortex and medulla play different roles in the development of T cells.

Complex regional pain syndrome<====>56283<====>Complex regional pain syndrome  Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), also known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), is a disorder of a portion of the body, usually the arms or legs, which manifests as pain, swelling, limited range of motion, and changes to the skin and bones.  It may initially affect one limb and then spread throughout the body; 35% of affected people report symptoms throughout their whole body.There are multiple names for this disease, as well as two subtypes.  Type I (also called reflex sympathetic dystrophy) refers to CRPS without evidence of a specific peripheral nerve injury. 

Acorn Computers<====>56284<====>Acorn Computers    Acorn Computers Ltd.  was a British computer company established in Cambridge, England, in 1978.  The company produced a number of computers which were especially popular in the UK, including the Acorn Electron and the Acorn Archimedes.  Acorn's BBC Micro computer dominated the UK educational computer market during the 1980s.   It is more known for itscomputer than for its other products. Though the company was broken up into several independent operations in 1998, its legacy includes the development of reduced instruction set computing (RISC) personal computers. 

Disability<====>56285<====>Disability    Disability is an impairment that may be cognitive, developmental, intellectual, mental, physical, sensory, or some combination of these.  It substantially affects a person's life activities and may be present from birth or occur during a person's lifetime.Disability is a contested concept, with different meanings for different communities.   It may be used to refer to physical or mental attributes that some institutions, particularly medicine, view as needing to be fixed (the medical model).  It may refer to limitations imposed on people by the constraints of an ableist society (the social model).

Schneider Trophy<====>56291<====>Schneider TrophyThe Coupe d ' Aviation Maritime Jacques Schneider, commonly called the Schneider Trophy or Schneider Prize (sometimes incorrectly referred to as the Schneider Cup, a different prize), was a trophy awarded annually (and later, biannually) to the winner of a race for seaplanes and flying boats.  The Schneider Trophy is now held at the Science Museum, South Kensington, London. Announced in 1912 by Jacques Schneider, a French financier, balloonist and aircraft enthusiast, the competition offered a prize of approximately £1,000.  The race was held twelve times between 1913 and 1931.  It was intended to encourage technical advances in civil aviation but became a contest for pure speed with laps over a (usually) triangular course (initially 280 km, later 350 km). 

Clive Sinclair<====>56293<====>Clive Sinclair    Sir Clive Marles Sinclair (born 30 July 1940) is an English entrepreneur and inventor, most commonly known for his work in consumer electronics in the late 1970s and early 1980s. After spending several years as assistant editor of Instrument Practice, Sinclair founded Sinclair Radionics in 1961, where he produced the first slim-line electronic pocket calculator in 1972 (the Sinclair Executive).  Sinclair later moved into the production of home computers and produced the Sinclair ZX80, the UK's first mass-market home computer for less than £100, and later, with Sinclair Research, the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum; the latter is widely recognised for its importance in the early days of the British home computer industry. 

Dagobah<====>56295<====>Dagobah  Dagobah is a star system in the Star Wars films The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.  It also appears in a deleted scene from Revenge of the Sith.  Yoda went into exile on Dagobah after a lightsaber battle with Darth Sidious. The planet shown in Dagobah, in the Sluis sector, is a world of murky swamps, steaming bayous, and petrified forests, resembling Earth during the Carboniferous Period. Film historyIn the Star Wars storyline, after the Great Jedi Purge and his subsequent failure to defeat Darth Sidious, Jedi Master Yoda went into voluntary exile on Dagobah.

Eskimo bowline<====>56303<====>Eskimo bowline The Eskimo bowline is a knot that places a loop in the end of a rope.   Whereas the standard bowline knot loops the working end around the standing part, the Eskimo bowline loops it around its own descending part. The Eskimo bowline is best used in applications in which the loop will be stretched wide.  In applications where the two legs of the loop are nearly parallel, a bowline is superior.  The structure of the knot was not identified by Clifford Ashley (in 1944).  All of the maneuvers to tie this knot are generally in the opposite (or ‘anti’ direction) relative to the Bowline.

Located midway between Denver and Colorado Springs, Castle Rock is part of the Denver Metropolitan Area and the Front Range Urban Corridor. HistoryThe region in and around Castle Rock was originally home to the Arapaho and Cheyenne people. 

Zoning<====>56313<====>Zoning Zoning is the process of dividing land in a municipality into zones (e. g.  residential, industrial) in which certain land uses are permitted or prohibited.   The type of zone determines whether planning permission for a given development is granted.  Zoning may specify a variety of outright and conditional uses of land.  It may also indicate the size and dimensions of land area as well as the form and scale of buildings.  These guidelines are set in order to guide urban growth and development.Areas of land are divided by appropriate authorities into zones within which various uses are permitted. 

Champerty and maintenance<====>56314<====>Champerty and maintenance  Champerty and maintenance are doctrines in common law jurisdictions that aim to preclude frivolous litigation.  "Maintenance" is the intermeddling of a disinterested party to encourage a lawsuit.   It is "A taking in hand, a bearing up or upholding of quarrels or sides, to the disturbance of the common right. "  "Champerty" (from Old French champart, a feudal lord's share of produce) is the "maintenance" of a person in a lawsuit on condition that the subject matter of the action is to be shared with the maintainer.   Among laypersons, this is known as litigation finance. 

Mango<====>56315<====>Mango   Mangoes are juicy stone fruit (drupe) from numerous species of tropical trees belonging to the flowering plant genus Mangifera, cultivated mostly for their edible fruit.  The majority of these species are found in nature as wild mangoes.  The genus belongs to the cashew family Anacardiaceae.  Mangoes are native to South Asia,  from where the "common mango" or "Indian mango", Mangifera indica, has been distributed worldwide to become one of the most widely cultivated fruits in the tropics.  Other Mangifera species (e. g.  horse mango, Mangifera foetida) are grown on a more localized basis. 

Khat<====>56324<====>KhatKhat (Catha edulis, qat from    ) is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.  Khat contains the alkaloid cathinone, an amphetamine-like stimulant, which is said to cause excitement, loss of appetite, and euphoria.  Among communities from the areas where the plant is native, khat chewing has a history as a social custom dating back thousands of years analogous to the use of coca leaves in South America and betel nut in Asia.  The World Health Organization (WHO) classified it in 1980 as a drug of abuse that can produce psychological dependence,    although the WHO does not consider khat addiction to be seriously problematic. 

Necromancy<====>56329<====>Necromancy  Necromancy (   ) is a supposed practice of magic involving communication with the deceased – either by summoning their spirit as an apparition or raising them bodily – for the purpose of divination, imparting the means to foretell future events or discover hidden knowledge, to bring someone back from the dead, or to use the deceased as a weapon, as the term may sometimes be used in a more general sense to refer to black magic or witchcraft.   The word "necromancy" is adapted from Late Latin necromantia, itself borrowed from post-Classical Greek νεκρομαντεία (nekromanteía), a compound of Ancient Greek νεκρός (nekrós), "dead body", and μαντεία (manteía), "divination by means of"; this compound form was first used by Origen of Alexandria in the 3rd century AD. 

Root<====>56333<====>Root   In vascular plants, the root is the organ of a plant that typically lies below the surface of the soil.  Roots can also be aerial or aerating, that is, growing up above the ground or especially above water.  Furthermore, a stem normally occurring below ground is not exceptional either (see rhizome).  Therefore, the root is best defined as the non-leaf, non-nodes bearing parts of the plant's body.  However, important internal structural differences between stems and roots exist. Evolutionary history The fossil record of roots – or rather, infilled voids where roots rotted after death – spans back to the late Silurian.

Aldose reductase inhibitor<====>56350<====>Aldose reductase inhibitorAldose reductase inhibitors are a class of drugs being studied as a way to prevent eye and nerve damage in people with diabetes. MechanismTheir target, aldose reductase, is an enzyme that is normally present in many other parts of the body, and catalyzes one of the steps in the sorbitol(polyol) pathway that is responsible for fructose formation from glucose.  Aldose reductase activity increases as the glucose concentration rises in diabetes in those tissues that are not insulin sensitive, which include the lenses, peripheral nerves and glomerulus.  Sorbitol does not diffuse through cell membranes easily and therefore accumulates, causing osmotic damage which leads to retinopathy and neuropathy. 

Linear span<====>56353<====>Linear spanIn linear algebra, the linear span (also called the linear hull or just span) of a set of vectors in a vector space is the intersection of all subspaces containing that set.  The linear span of a set of vectors is therefore a vector space.  Spans can be generalized to matroids and modules. DefinitionGiven a vector space V over a field K, the span of a set S of vectors (not necessarily infinite) is defined to be the intersection W of all subspaces of V that contain S.  W is referred to as the subspace spanned by S, or by the vectors in S. 

Gerald of Wales<====>56354<====>Gerald of Wales   Gerald of Wales ( ;  ;  ;  ) was a Cambro-Norman archdeacon of Brecon and historian.  As a royal clerk to the king and two archbishops, he travelled widely and wrote extensively.  He both studied and taught in France and visited Rome several times, meeting the Pope.  He was nominated for several bishoprics but turned them down in the hope of becoming bishop of St Davids, but was unsuccessful despite considerable support.  His final post was as archdeacon of Brecon, from which he retired to academic study for the remainder of his life. 

Geoffrey of Monmouth<====>56355<====>Geoffrey of Monmouth   Geoffrey of Monmouth ( ,   ; c.  1095 - c.  1155) was a British cleric and one of the major figures in the development of British historiography and the popularity of tales of King Arthur.  He is best known for his chronicle The History of the Kings of Britain (  or  ),  which was widely popular in its day, being translated into various other languages from its original Latin.  It was credited, uncritically, well into the 16th century,  but is now considered historically unreliable. BiographyGeoffrey was probably born some time around 1095 "Geoffrey of Monmouth (floruit 1112-1139/ lifespan circa 1095-1155)"  in Wales or the Welsh Marches. 

Llandaff<====>56356<====>Llandaff   Llandaff ( ;    ); from   'church' and Taf, is a district and community in the north of Cardiff, capital of Wales, having been incorporated into the city in 1922.   It is the seat of the Bishop of Llandaff, whose diocese within the Church in Wales covers the most populous area of South Wales. HistoryMost of the history of Llandaff centres on its role as a religious site.   Before the creation of Llandaff Cathedral, it became established as a Christian place of worship in the 6th century AD, probably because of its location as the first firm ground north of the point where the river Taff met the Bristol Channel, and because of its pre-Christian location as a river crossing on a north-south trade route. 

Linear subspace<====>56357<====>Linear subspace   One-dimensional subspaces in the two-dimensional vector space over the finite field F 5 .  The origin (0, 0), marked with green circles, belongs to any of six 1-subspaces, while each of 24 remaining points belongs to exactly one; a property which holds for 1-subspaces over any field and in all dimensions.  All F 5  2  (i. e.  a 5 × 5 square) is pictured four times for a better visualization In linear algebra and related fields of mathematics, a linear subspace, also known as a vector subspace, or, in the older literature, a linear manifold,   is a vector space that is a subset of some other (higher-dimension) vector space. 

Mangifera<====>56358<====>Mangifera Mangifera is a genus of flowering plants in the cashew family, Anacardiaceae.  It contains approximately 69 species, with the best-known being the Common Mango (Mangifera indica).  The center of diversity is in subtropical and tropical South Asia and Southeast Asia, while the highest number of species occur in India.  They are generally canopy trees in lowland rainforests, reaching a height of  .    UsesMangifera species are widely cultivated in Asia and elsewhere.  More than 27 species in the genus bear edible, fleshy fruits, especially the Common Mango (M.  indica).  Others, such as M. 

Leo Szilard<====>56359<====>Leo Szilard   Leo Szilard ( ;  ;  ;   until age 2; February 11, 1898 – May 30, 1964) was a Hungarian-born German and American physicist and inventor.  He conceived the nuclear chain reaction in 1933, patented the idea of a nuclear reactor with Enrico Fermi in 1934, and in late 1939 wrote the letter for Albert Einstein's signature that resulted in the Manhattan Project that built the atomic bomb. Szilard initially attended Palatine Joseph Technical University in Budapest, but his engineering studies were interrupted by service in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. 

Sorbitol<====>56360<====>Sorbitol Sorbitol ( ), less commonly known as glucitol ( ), is a sugar alcohol with a sweet taste which the human body metabolizes slowly.  It can be obtained by reduction of glucose, which changes the aldehyde group to a hydroxyl group.  Most sorbitol is made from corn syrup, but it is also found in nature, for example in apples, pears, peaches, and prunes.It is converted to fructose by sorbitol-6-phosphate 2-dehydrogenase.  Sorbitol is an isomer of mannitol, another sugar alcohol; the two differ only in the orientation of the hydroxyl group on carbon 2. 

Freeflying<====>56361<====>FreeflyingFreeflying is a skydiving discipline which began in the late 1980s, involving freefalling in various vertical orientations, as opposed to the traditional "belly-to-earth" orientation.  The discipline is known to have originated when Olav Zipser began experimenting with non-traditional forms of bodyflight.  Zipser founded the FreeFly Clowns as a two-person competitive team with Mike Vail in 1992, and was joined by Omar Alhegelan (1st ever FAI Freestyle World Cup & World Champion), Charles Bryan, and Stefania Martinengo in 1994.   The FreeFly Clowns are also credited with opening the first school to teach freeflying, The First School of Modern SkyFlying. 

Andrew Inglis Clark<====>56368<====>Andrew Inglis Clark  Andrew Inglis Clark (24 February 1848 -14 November 1907) was an Australian Founding Father and the principal author of the Australian Constitution;  he was also an engineer, barrister, politician, electoral reformer and jurist.  He initially qualified as an engineer, but he re-trained as a barrister in order to effectively fight for social causes which deeply concerned him.   After a long political career, mostly spent as Attorney-General, he was appointed a Senior Justice of the Supreme Court of Tasmania.   Despite being acknowledged as the leading expert on the Australian Constitution, he was never appointed to the High Court of Australia. 

Bell's theorem<====>56369<====>Bell's theorem  Bell's theorem is a "no-go theorem" that draws an important distinction between quantum mechanics (QM) and the world as described by classical mechanics.  This theorem is named after John Stewart Bell. In its simplest form, Bell's theorem states:    Bell himself wrote: "If [a hidden variable theory] is local it will not agree with quantum mechanics, and if it agrees with quantum mechanics it will not be local.   This is what the theorem says. "  John Bell, Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics, Cambridge University Press, 1987, p.  65.   Cornell solid-state physicist David Mermin has described the appraisals of the importance of Bell's theorem in the physics community as ranging from "indifference" to "wild extravagance". 

Mass (liturgy)<====>56371<====>Mass (liturgy)   Mass is a term used to describe the main eucharistic liturgical service in many forms of Western Christianity.  The term mass is commonly used in the Catholic Church,  Anglican,  as well as some Lutheran churches,    Methodist,   Western Rite Orthodox and Old Catholic churches. Some Protestants employ terms such as Divine Service or service of worship, rather than the word Mass.   For the celebration of the Eucharist in Eastern Christianity, including Eastern Catholic Churches, other terms such as Divine Liturgy, Holy Qurbana, and Badarak are typically used instead. 

List of major opera composers<====>56374<====>List of major opera composersThis list provides a guide to opera composers, as determined by their presence on a majority of compiled lists of significant opera composers.  (See the "Lists Consulted" section for full details. ) The composers run from Jacopo Peri, who wrote the first ever opera in late 16th century Italy, to John Adams, one of the leading figures in the contemporary operatic world.  The brief accompanying notes offer an explanation as to why each composer has been considered major.  Also included is a section about major women opera composers, compiled from the same lists. 

Aniara<====>56375<====>Aniara   Aniara (  ) is a poem of science fiction written by Swedish Nobel laureate Harry Martinson in 1956.  It was published on 13 October 1956.  Preface to  , the Italian edition of Aniara.   The title comes from ancient Greek ἀνιαρός, "sad, despairing", plus special resonances that the sound "a" had for Martinson.  Aniara is an effort to "[mediate] between science and poetry, between the wish to understand and the difficulty to comprehend. "  Martinson translates scientific imagery into the poem: for example, the "curved space" from Einstein's general theory of relativity is likely an inspiration for Martinson's description of the cosmos as "a bowl of glass.

Operation Market Garden<====>56433<====>Operation Market Garden  Operation Market Garden (17–25 September 1944) was an unsuccessful Allied military operation, fought in the Netherlands and Germany in the Second World War.  Airborne and land forces succeeded in the liberation of the Dutch cities of Eindhoven and Nijmegen, but failed in keeping their further positions in and around the city of Arnhem with its strategically important bridge over the river Rhine. The operation was split into two sub-operations:Market – the airborne forces, the First Allied Airborne Army, who would seize bridgesGarden – the ground forces, consisting of the British XXX CorpsMarket Garden contained the largest airborne operation up to that point. 

Julia set<====>56434<====>Julia setIn the context of complex dynamics, a topic of mathematics, the Julia set and the Fatou set are two complementary sets (Julia 'laces' and Fatou 'dusts') defined from a function.  Informally, the Fatou set of the function consists of values with the property that all nearby values behave similarly under repeated iteration of the function, and the Julia set consists of values such that an arbitrarily small perturbation can cause drastic changes in the sequence of iterated function values. Thus the behavior of the function on the Fatou set is 'regular', while on the Julia set its behavior is 'chaotic'. 

Obesity<====>56435<====>ObesityObesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health.   People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over  , with the range   defined as overweight.   Some East Asian countries use lower values.Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases and conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, osteoarthritis and depression. 

Infrared astronomy<====>56437<====>Infrared astronomy Infrared astronomy is the branch of astronomy and astrophysics that studies astronomical objects visible in infrared (IR) radiation.  The wavelength of infrared light ranges from 0. 75 to 300 micrometers.  Infrared falls in between visible radiation, which ranges from 380 to 750 nanometers, and submillimeter waves. Infrared astronomy began in the 1830s, a few decades after the discovery of infrared light by William Herschel in 1800.  Early progress was limited, and it was not until the early 20th century that conclusive detections of astronomical objects other than the Sun and Moon were detected in infrared light. 

Akhnaten (opera)<====>56438<====>Akhnaten (opera)  Akhnaten is an opera in three acts based on the life and religious convictions of the pharaoh Akhenaten (Amenhotep IV),  written by the American minimalist composer Philip Glass in 1983.  Akhnaten had its world premiere on March 24, 1984, at the Stuttgart State Theatre, under the German title Echnaton.  Paul Esswood sang the title role, German director Achim Freyer staged the opera in an abstract style with highly ritualistic movements.  The American premiere was held on October 12, 1984, at the Houston Grand Opera, where Glass's opera The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 also premiered.

Orbital inclination<====>56440<====>Orbital inclination Orbital inclination measures the tilt of an object's orbit around a celestial body.   It is expressed as the angle between a reference plane and the orbital plane or axis of direction of the orbiting object. For a satellite orbiting the Earth directly above the equator, the plane of the satellite's orbit is the same as the Earth's equatorial plane, and the satellite's orbital inclination is 0°.  The general case for a circular orbit is that it is tilted, spending half an orbit over the northern hemisphere and half over the southern.  If the orbit swung between 20° north latitude and 20° south latitude, then its orbital inclination would be 20°. 

A Dictionary of Modern English Usage<====>56442<====>A Dictionary of Modern English Usage   A Dictionary of Modern English Usage (1926), by Henry Watson Fowler (1858–1933), is a style guide to British English usage, pronunciation, and writing.  Covering topics such as plurals and literary technique, distinctions among like words (homonyms and synonyms), and the use of foreign terms, the dictionary became the standard for other guides to writing in English.  Hence, the 1926 first edition remains in print, along with the 1965 second edition, edited by Ernest Gowers, and reprinted in 1983 and 1987.  The 1996 third edition, re-titled as The New Fowler’s Modern English Usage (revised in 2004) was mostly rewritten by Robert W. 

Jeans<====>56444<====>Jeans   Jeans are a type of trousers, typically made from denim or dungaree cloth.  Often the term "jeans" refers to a particular style of trousers, called "blue jeans," which were invented by Jacob W.  Davis in partnership with Levi Strauss & Co.  in 1871  and patented by Jacob W.  Davis and Levi Strauss on May 20, 1873.  Prior to the Levi Strauss patented trousers, the term "blue jeans" had been long in use for various garments (including trousers, overalls, and coats), constructed from blue colored denim.   Originally designed for cowboys and miners, jeans became popular in the 1950s among teenagers, especially members of the greaser subculture. 

Theo Wade Brown<====>56447<====>Theo Wade Brown Theo Wade Brown (26 May 1950 - 30 April 2002) was an English carpenter, designer and engineer.

Antonio Stradivari<====>56455<====>Antonio Stradivari   Antonio Stradivari  ; (1644 – December 18, 1737) was an Italian luthier and a crafter of string instruments such as violins, cellos, guitars, violas and harps.   Stradivari is generally considered the most significant and greatest artisan in this field.  The Latinized form of his surname, Stradivarius, as well as the colloquial "Strad" are terms often used to refer to his instruments.  It is estimated that Stradivari produced 1,116 instruments, 960 of which were violins.  Around 650 instruments survived, including 450 to 512 violins. BiographyFamily background and early lifeAntonio Stradivari's birthdate, presumably between 1644 and 1649, has been debated amongst historians due to the numerous inconsistencies in the evidence of the latter. 

Apraxia<====>56458<====>Apraxia Apraxia is a motor disorder caused by damage to the brain (specifically the posterior parietal cortex), in which the individual has difficulty with the motor planning to perform tasks or movements when asked, provided that the request or command is understood and he/she is willing to perform the task.  The nature of the brain damage determines the severity, and the absence of sensory loss or paralysis helps to explain the level of difficulty.  The term comes from the Greek ἀ- a- ("without") and πρᾶξις praxis ("action").  TypesThere are several types of apraxia including:Ideomotor apraxia:  These patients have deficits in their ability to plan or complete motor actions that rely on semantic memory. 

Canavan disease<====>56461<====>Canavan disease Canavan disease, also called Canavan–van Bogaert–Bertrand disease, is an autosomal recessive  degenerative disorder that causes progressive damage to nerve cells in the brain, and is one of the most common degenerative cerebral diseases of infancy.  It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme aminoacylase 2,    and is one of a group of genetic diseases referred to as leukodystrophies.  It is characterized by degeneration of myelin in the phospholipid layer insulating the axon of a neuron and is associated with a gene located on human chromosome 17. SymptomsSymptoms of the most common (and most serious) form of Canavan disease typically appear in early infancy usually between the first three to six months of age. 

Carpal tunnel syndrome<====>56462<====>Carpal tunnel syndrome  Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a medical condition due to compression of the median nerve as it travels through the wrist at the carpal tunnel.   The main symptoms are pain, numbness, and tingling, in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the thumb side of the ring fingers.Symptoms typically start gradually and during the night.   Pain may extend up the arm.   Weak grip strength may occur and after a long period of time the muscles at the base of the thumb may waste away.In more than half of cases both sides are affected. 

Joubert syndrome<====>56464<====>Joubert syndrome Joubert syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder that affects the cerebellum, an area of the brain that controls balance and coordination. Joubert syndrome is one of the many genetic syndromes associated with syndromic retinitis pigmentosa.   The syndrome was first identified in 1969 by pediatric neurologist Marie Joubert in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, while working at the Montreal Neurological Institute and McGill University.    Signs and symptomsMost of the signs and symptoms of the Joubert syndrome appear very early in infancy with most children showing delays in gross motor milestones.Although other signs and symptoms vary widely from individual to individual, they generally fall under the hallmark of cerebellum involvement or in this case, lack thereof. 

Cassava<====>56465<====>Cassava  Manihot esculenta (commonly called cassava ( ), manioc, yuca, mandioca and Brazilian arrowroot   ) is a woody shrub native to South America of the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae.  It is extensively cultivated as an annual crop in tropical and subtropical regions for its edible starchy tuberous root, a major source of carbohydrates.  Though it is often called yuca in Spanish and in the United States, it differs from yucca, an unrelated fruit-bearing shrub in the family Asparagaceae.  Cassava, when dried to a powdery (or pearly) extract, is called tapioca; its fermented, flaky version is named garri. 

Neurofibromatosis<====>56466<====>Neurofibromatosis  Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a group of three conditions in which tumors grow in the nervous system.   The three types are neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), and schwannomatosis.   In NF1 symptoms include light brown spots on the skin, freckles in the armpit and groin, small bumps within nerves, and scoliosis.   In NF2 there may be hearing loss, cataracts at a young age, balance problems, flesh colored skin flaps, and muscle wasting. The tumors are generally non cancerous.   The cause is a genetic mutation in certain genes. 

Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease<====>56469<====>Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease  Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) is a rare central nervous system disorder in which coordination, motor abilities, and intellectual function are delayed to variable extents.    SymptomsMovements of the eyes left to right.  Little or no movement in the arms or legs.  Respiratory troubles/problems. Cause DiagnosisThe diagnosis of PMD is often first suggested after identification by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of abnormal white matter (high T2 signal intensity, i. e.  T2 lengthening) throughout the brain, which is typically evident by about 1 year of age, but more subtle abnormalities should be evident during infancy. 

Leopold I of Belgium<====>56470<====>Leopold I of Belgium  Leopold I ( , German and  ;  16 December 1790 in Coburg – 10 December 1865 in Laeken) was a German prince who became the first King of the Belgians following the country's independence in 1830.  He reigned between July 1831 and December 1865. Born into the ruling family of the small German duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, Leopold took a commission in the Imperial Russian Army and fought against Napoleon after French troops overran Saxe-Coburg during the Napoleonic Wars.  After Napoleon's defeat, Leopold moved to the United Kingdom where he married Princess Charlotte of Wales, the only child of the Prince Regent (the future King George IV), thus situating himself  as close as possible to the future sovereign of the United Kingdom.

Rett syndrome<====>56476<====>Rett syndromeRett syndrome (RTT) is a genetic brain disorder which typically becomes apparent after six months of age in females.   Symptoms include problems with language, coordination, and repetitive movements.   Often there is slower growth, problems walking, and a smaller head size. Complications can include seizures, scoliosis, and sleeping problems.   Those affected, however, may be affected to different degrees.   Rett syndrome is due to a genetic mutation of the MECP2 gene.   This gene occurs on the X chromosome.   Typically it develops as a new mutation, with less than one percent of cases being inherited from a person's parents. 

North<====>56478<====>North   North is one of the four compass points or cardinal directions.  It is the opposite of south and is perpendicular to east and west.  North is a noun, adjective, or adverb indicating direction or geography. Etymology The word north is related to the Old High German nord , both descending from the Proto-Indo-European unit ner-, meaning "down" (or "under").  (Presumably  a natural primitive description of its concept is "to the left of the rising sun". )The Latin word borealis comes from the Greek boreas "north wind, north", which, according to Ovid, was personified as the son of the river-god Strymon, the father of Calais and Zetes. 

Theaetetus (dialogue)<====>56479<====>Theaetetus (dialogue)  The Theaetetus ( ;  ) is one of Plato's dialogues concerning the nature of knowledge, written circa 369 BC. In this dialogue, Socrates and Theaetetus discuss three definitions of knowledge: knowledge as nothing but perception, knowledge as true judgment, and, finally, knowledge as a true judgment with an account.  Each of these definitions is shown to be unsatisfactory. Socrates declares Theaetetus will have benefited from discovering what he does not know, and that he may be better able to approach the topic in the future.  The conversation ends with Socrates' announcement that he has to go to court to face a criminal indictment. 

Q fever<====>56480<====>Q fever Q fever is a disease caused by infection with Coxiella burnetii,    a bacterium that affects humans and other animals.  This organism is uncommon, but may be found in cattle, sheep, goats, and other domestic mammals, including cats and dogs.  The infection results from inhalation of a spore-like small-cell variant, and from contact with the milk, urine, feces, vaginal mucus, or semen of infected animals.  Rarely, the disease is tick-borne.   The incubation period is 9–40 days.  Humans are vulnerable to Q fever, and infection can result from even a few organisms.   The bacterium is an obligate intracellular pathogenic parasite. 

Tay–Sachs disease<====>56481<====>Tay–Sachs disease  Tay–Sachs disease is a genetic disorder that results in the destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.   The most common type, known as infantile Tay–Sachs disease, becomes apparent around three to six months of age with the baby losing the ability to turn over, sit, or crawl.   This is then followed by seizures, hearing loss, and inability to move.   Death usually occurs in early childhood.   Less commonly the disease may occur in later childhood or adulthood.   These forms are generally milder in nature.   Tay–Sachs disease is caused by a genetic mutation in the HEXA genes on chromosome 15. 

Tourette syndrome<====>56483<====>Tourette syndrome Tourette syndrome (TS or simply Tourette's) is a common neuropsychiatric disorder with onset in childhood,  characterized by multiple motor tics and at least one vocal (phonic) tic.  These tics characteristically wax and wane, can be suppressed temporarily, and are typically preceded by an unwanted urge or sensation in the affected muscles.  Some common tics are eye blinking, coughing, throat clearing, sniffing, and facial movements.  Tourette's does not adversely affect intelligence or life expectancy.  Tourette's is defined as part of a spectrum of tic disorders, which includes provisional, transient and persistent (chronic) tics. 

Low-pass filter<====>56484<====>Low-pass filter A low-pass filter (LPF) is a filter that passes signals with a frequency lower than a certain cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency.  The exact frequency response of the filter depends on the filter design.  The filter is sometimes called a high-cut filter, or treble-cut filter in audio applications.  A low-pass filter is the complement of a high-pass filter. Low-pass filters exist in many different forms, including electronic circuits such as a hiss filter used in audio, anti-aliasing filters for conditioning signals prior to analog-to-digital conversion, digital filters for smoothing sets of data, acoustic barriers, blurring of images, and so on. 

High-pass filter<====>56486<====>High-pass filter A high-pass filter (HPF) is an electronic filter that passes signals with a frequency higher than a certain cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency.  The amount of attenuation for each frequency depends on the filter design.   A high-pass filter is usually modeled as a linear time-invariant system.  It is sometimes called a low-cut filter or bass-cut filter.High-pass filters have many uses, such as blocking DC from circuitry sensitive to non-zero average voltages or radio frequency devices.  They can also be used in conjunction with a low-pass filter to produce a bandpass filter. 

Sax Rohmer<====>56487<====>Sax Rohmer   Arthur Henry Sarsfield Ward (15 February 1883 – 1 June 1959), better known as Sax Rohmer, was a prolific English novelist.

The sovereign is the personification of the Canadian state and is Canada as a matter of constitutional law.The current Canadian monarch is Queen Elizabeth II, who has reigned since 6 February 1952.  Elizabeth's eldest son, Prince Charles, is heir apparent. Although the person of the sovereign is equally shared with 15 other independent countries within the Commonwealth of Nations, each country's monarchy is separate and legally distinct. 

Schoharie County, New York<====>56505<====>Schoharie County, New York Schoharie County is a county located in the U. S.  state of New York.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 32,749.The county seat is Schoharie.The name of the county and the county seat come from a Mohawk word meaning "floating driftwood. "Schoharie County is part of the Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area. History The large territory of the county (much of upstate and western New York) was long occupied by the Mohawk Indians and, to the west, other four tribes of the Iroquois League (increased to six with the migration of the Tuscarora from the South to New York in 1722). 

Saratoga County, New York<====>56506<====>Saratoga County, New York  Saratoga County is a county in the U. S.  state of New York.  As of the 2016 U. S.  Census estimate, the county's population was 227,053, representing a 3. 4% increase from the 2010 population of 219,607,  representing one of the fastest growth rates in the northeastern United States.  The county seat is Ballston Spa.Saratoga County is included in the Capital District, encompassing the Albany-Schenectady-Troy, New York Metropolitan Statistical Area. Saratoga County's name was derived from the Native American word "sah-rah-ka", or "Sarach-togue", meaning "the hill beside the river", referring to the Hudson River bordering the county on its eastern flank and the Mohawk River delineating its southern border. 

Marlinespike hitch<====>56507<====>Marlinespike hitch The marlinespike hitch is a temporary knot used to attach a rod to a rope in order to form a handle.  Clifford W.  Ashley, The Ashley Book of Knots (New York: Doubleday, 1944), 330.    This allows more tension than could be produced comfortably by gripping the rope with the hands alone.   It is useful when tightening knots and for other purposes in ropework.   As the name suggests, the type of rod traditionally used with this hitch is a marlinespike.   The advantages of this hitch over others which might serve the purpose are its quickness of tying and ease of releasing. 

Judi Bari<====>56508<====>Judi Bari  Judi Bari (November 7, 1949 – March 2, 1997) was an American environmentalist and labor leader, a feminist, and the principal organizer of Earth First! campaigns against logging in the ancient redwood forests of Northern California in the 1980s and '90s.  She also organized efforts through Earth First! – Industrial Workers of the World Local 1 to bring timber workers and environmentalists together in common cause. Family background and early lifeBari was born and raised in Silver Spring, Maryland, the daughter of mathematician Ruth Aaronson Bari and diamond setter Arthur Bari.  The elder Baris were both active in left-wing politics; they advocated for civil rights and opposed the Vietnam War. 

Potash<====>56509<====>Potash Potash ( ) is any of various mined and manufactured salts that contain potassium in water-soluble form.  Potash, USGS 2008 Minerals Yearbook  The name derives from pot ash, which refers to plant ashes soaked in water in a pot, the primary means of manufacturing the product before the industrial era.  The word potassium is derived from potash.  Potash is produced worldwide at amounts exceeding 30 million tonnes per year, mostly for use in fertilizers.  Various types of fertilizer-potash thus constitute the single largest industrial use of the element potassium in the world.  Potassium was first derived in 1807 by electrolysis of caustic potash (potassium hydroxide). 

Angiopathy<====>56510<====>AngiopathyAngiopathy is the generic term for a disease of the blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries).   The best known and most prevalent angiopathy is diabetic angiopathy, a common complication of chronic diabetes. ClassificationBy caliberThere are two types of angiopathy: macroangiopathy and microangiopathy.  In macroangiopathy, atherosclerosis and a resultant blood clot forms on the large blood vessels, sticks to the vessel walls, and blocks the flow of blood.  Macroangiopathy may cause other complications, such as ischemic heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease which contributes to the diabetic foot ulcers and the risk of amputation. In microangiopathy, the walls of the smaller blood vessels become so thick and weak that they bleed, leak protein, and slow the flow of blood through the body. 

Dialysis<====>56511<====>Dialysis  In medicine, dialysis (from Greek διάλυσις, diàlysis, "dissolution"; from διά, dià, "through", and λύσις, lỳsis, "loosening or splitting") is the process of removing excess water, solutes and toxins from the blood in those whose native kidneys have lost the ability to perform these functions in a natural way.  This is referred to as renal replacement therapy.  Dialysis may be used in those with rapidly developing loss of kidney function, called acute kidney injury, (previously called acute renal failure); or slowly worsening kidney function, called Stage 5 chronic kidney disease, (previously called chronic kidney failure and end-stage renal disease and end-stage kidney disease). 

Capillary<====>56512<====>Capillary  A capillary (  in US;   in UK) is a small blood vessel from 5 to 10 micrometres (µm) in diameter, and having a wall one endothelial cell thick.  They are the smallest blood vessels in the body: they convey blood between the arterioles and venules.  These microvessels are the site of exchange of  many substances with the interstitial fluid surrounding them.  Substances which exit include water (proximal portion), oxygen, and glucose; substances which enter include water (distal portion), carbon dioxide, uric acid, lactic acid, urea and  creatinine.   Lymph capillaries connect with larger lymph vessels to drain lymphatic fluid collected in the microcirculation. 

Raymond Smullyan<====>56517<====>Raymond Smullyan Raymond Merrill Smullyan ( ; May 25, 1919 – February 6, 2017)    was an American mathematician, concert pianist, logician, Taoist, and philosopher. Born in Far Rockaway, New York, his first career was stage magic.  He then earned a BSc from the University of Chicago in 1955 and his Ph. D.  from Princeton University in 1959.  He is one of many logicians to have studied under Alonzo Church.    LifeBorn in Far Rockaway, New York, he showed musical talent, winning a gold medal in a piano competition when he was aged 12. 

Wilderness area<====>56518<====>Wilderness area A wilderness area is a region where the land is in a natural state; where impacts from human activities are minimal—that is, as a wilderness.  It might also be called a wild or natural area.  Especially in wealthier, industrialized nations, it has a specific legal meaning as well: as land where development is prohibited by law.  Many nations have designated Wilderness Areas, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States. The WILD Foundation states that wilderness areas have two dimensions: they must be biologically intact and legally protected.   The World Conservation Union (IUCN) classifies wilderness at two levels, Ia (Strict Nature Preserves) and Ib (Wilderness areas). 

Riding (country subdivision)<====>56519<====>Riding (country subdivision) A riding is an administrative jurisdiction or electoral district, particularly in several current or former Commonwealth countries.  EtymologyThe word riding is descended from late Old English *þriðing or *þriding (recorded only in Latin contexts or forms, e. g. , trehing, treding, trithing, with Latin initial t here representing the Old English letter thorn).   It came into Old English as a loanword from Old Norse þriðjungr, meaning a third part (especially of a county), cf.  farthing.   The modern form riding was the result of initial th being absorbed in the final th or t of the words north, south, east and west, by which it was normally preceded. 

Conservation easement<====>56520<====>Conservation easementIn the United States, a conservation easement (also called conservation covenant, conservation restriction or conservation servitude) is a power invested in a qualified private land conservation organization (often called a "land trust") or government (municipal, county, state or federal) to constrain, as to a specified land area, the exercise of rights otherwise held by a landowner so as to achieve certain conservation purposes.  It is an interest in real property established by agreement between a landowner and land trust or unit of government.  The conservation easement "runs with the land," meaning it is applicable to both present and future owners of the land. 

Right-wing politics<====>56522<====>Right-wing politicsRight-wing politics hold that certain social orders and hierarchies are inevitable, natural, normal or desirable, typically supporting this position on the basis of natural law, economics or tradition. T.  Alexander Smith, Raymond Tatalovich.  Cultures at war: moral conflicts in western democracies.  Toronto, Canada: Broadview Press, Ltd, 2003.  p.  30.  "That viewpoint is held by contemporary sociologists, for whom 'right-wing movements' are conceptualized as 'social movements whose stated goals are to maintain structures of order, status, honor, or traditional social differences or values' as compared to left-wing movements which seek 'greater equality or political participation. 

Triglyceride<====>56525<====>TriglycerideA triglyceride (TG, triacylglycerol, TAG, or triacylglyceride) is an ester derived from glycerol and three to four fatty acids (from   and glyceride).   Triglycerides are the main constituents of body fat in humans and other animals, as well as vegetable fat.    They are also present in the blood to enable the bidirectional transference of adipose fat and blood glucose from the liver, and are a major component of human skin oils.  There are many different types of triglyceride, with the main division between saturated and unsaturated types.  Saturated fats are "saturated" with hydrogen — all available places where hydrogen atoms could be bonded to carbon atoms are occupied. 

Diabetic ketoacidosis<====>56526<====>Diabetic ketoacidosis   Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus.   Signs and symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, deep gasping breathing, increased urination, weakness, confusion, and occasionally loss of consciousness.   A person's breath may develop a specific smell.   Onset of symptoms is usually rapid.   In some cases people may not realize they previously had diabetes.DKA happens most often in those with type 1 diabetes, but can also occur in those with other types of diabetes under certain circumstances.   Triggers may include infection, not taking insulin correctly, stroke, and certain medications such as steroids. 

Galactose<====>56527<====>Galactose  Galactose (  +  , "milk sugar"), sometimes abbreviated Gal, is a monosaccharide sugar that is about as sweet as glucose, and about 30% as sweet as sucrose.   It is a C-4 epimer of glucose.  Galactan is a polymeric form of galactose found in hemicellulose, and forming the core of the galactans, a class of natural polymeric carbohydrates.  EtymologyThe word "Galactose" is coined by Charles Weissman in mid 19th century from Greek galaktos("milk") and the generic chemical suffix for sugars -ose.  Structure and isomerismGalactose exists in both open-chain and cyclic form.  The open-chain form has a carbonyl at the end of the chain. 

Retinopathy<====>56531<====>Retinopathy Retinopathy is any damage to the retina of the eyes, which may cause vision impairment.   Retinopathy often refers to retinal vascular disease, or damage to the retina caused by abnormal blood flow.Age-related macular degeneration is technically included under the umbrella term retinopathy but is often discussed as a separate entity.  Retinopathy, or retinal vascular disease, can be broadly categorized into proliferative and non-proliferative types.  Frequently, retinopathy is an ocular manifestation of systemic disease as seen in diabetes or hypertension.   Diabetes is the most common cause of retinopathy in the U. 

Diabetic retinopathy<====>56533<====>Diabetic retinopathy  Diabetic retinopathy, also known as diabetic eye disease, is a medical condition in which damage occurs to the retina due to diabetes mellitus and is a leading cause of blindness.  It affects up to 80 percent of people who have had diabetes for 20 years or more. At least 90% of new cases could be reduced if there were proper treatment and monitoring of the eyes.   The longer a person has diabetes, the higher his or her chances of developing diabetic retinopathy.   Each year in the United States, diabetic retinopathy accounts for 12% of all new cases of blindness. 

Rule of thumb<====>56538<====>Rule of thumb  The English phrase rule of thumb refers to a principle with broad application that is not intended to be strictly accurate or reliable for every situation.  It refers to an easily learned and easily applied procedure or standard, based on practical experience rather than theory.    The use of the phrase as denoting a rough measurement can be traced back to the seventeenth century.  A modern folk etymology holds that the phrase derives from the maximum width of a stick allowed for wife-beating under English law; this belief can be traced back to a rumored statement by the eighteenth-century judge Sir Francis Buller that a man may beat his wife with a stick no wider than his thumb. 

Hanna-Barbera<====>56542<====>Hanna-Barbera Hanna-Barbera Productions, Inc.  (simply known as Hanna-Barbera and also referred to as H-B Enterprises, H-B Production Company and Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, Inc. ) is an American animation studio that served as a division of Warner Bros.  Animation.  It was founded in 1957 by former Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer animation directors and Tom and Jerry creators William Hanna and Joseph Barbera.   For more than three decades in the mid-20th century, it was a prominent force in American television animation. The studio is known for creating a wide variety of popular animated characters and throughout the next 30 years, it produced a succession of cartoon shows, including The Flintstones, Yogi Bear, The Jetsons, Wacky Races, Scooby-Doo and The Smurfs. 

Beta cell<====>56549<====>Beta cell Beta cells (β cells) are a type of cell found in the pancreatic islets of the pancreas.  They make up 65-80% of the cells in the islets. FunctionThe primary function of a beta cell is to store and release insulin.  Insulin is a hormone that brings about effects which reduce blood glucose concentration.  Beta cells can respond quickly to spikes in blood glucose concentrations by secreting some of their stored insulin while simultaneously producing more. Control of insulin secretionVoltage-gated calcium channels and ATP-sensitive potassium ion channels are embedded in the cell surface membrane of beta cells. 

Vocational education<====>56551<====>Vocational education  Vocational education is education that prepares people to work in various jobs, such as a trade, a craft, or as a technician.  Vocational education is sometimes referred to as career education or technical education.   A vocational school is a type of educational institution specifically designed to provide vocational education. Vocational education can take place at the post-secondary, further education, and higher education level; and can interact with the apprenticeship system.  At the post-secondary level, vocational education is often provided by highly specialized trade, Technical schools, community colleges, colleges of further education UK,  universities, Institutes of technology / Polytechnic Institutes. 

Jet lag<====>56552<====>Jet lag  Jet lag is a physiological condition which results from alterations to the body's circadian rhythms resulting from rapid long-distance trans-meridian (east–west or west–east) travel.  For example, someone travelling from New York to London feels as if the time were five hours earlier than local time.  Jet lag was previously classified as one of the circadian rhythm sleep disorders.    The condition of jet lag may last several days before the traveller is fully adjusted to the new time zone; a recovery period of one day per time zone crossed is a suggested guideline. 

Ketone bodies<====>56556<====>Ketone bodies Ketone bodies are three  water-soluble molecules (acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and their spontaneous breakdown product, acetone) that are produced by the liver from fatty acids    during periods of low food intake (fasting), carbohydrate restrictive diets, starvation, prolonged intense exercise,  alcoholism or in untreated (or inadequately treated) type 1 diabetes mellitus.  These ketone bodies are readily picked up by the extra-hepatic tissues, and converted into acetyl-CoA which then enters the citric acid cycle and is oxidized in the mitochondria for energy.   In the brain, ketone bodies are also used to make acetyl-CoA into long-chain fatty acids. 

Blood glucose monitoring<====>56557<====>Blood glucose monitoring   Blood glucose monitoring is a way of testing the concentration of glucose in the blood (glycemia).    Particularly important in diabetes management, a blood glucose test is typically performed by piercing the skin (typically, on the finger) to draw blood, then applying the blood to a chemically active disposable 'test-strip'.   Different manufacturers use different technology, but most systems measure an electrical characteristic, and use this to determine the glucose level in the blood.  The test is usually referred to as capillary blood glucose. Healthcare professionals advise patients with diabetes mellitus on the appropriate monitoring regimen for their condition. 

Blood pressure<====>56558<====>Blood pressure  Blood pressure (BP) is the pressure of circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels.  Used without further specification, "blood pressure" usually refers to the pressure in large arteries of the systemic circulation.   Blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure (maximum during one heart beat) over diastolic pressure (minimum in between two heart beats) and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), above the surrounding atmospheric pressure (considered to be zero for convenience). It is one of the vital signs, along with respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature. 

Anesthesia<====>56561<====>Anesthesia   In the practice of medicine (especially surgery and dentistry), anesthesia or anaesthesia is a state of temporary induced loss of sensation or awareness.  It may include analgesia (relief from or prevention of pain), paralysis (muscle relaxation), amnesia (loss of memory), or unconsciousness.  A patient under the effects of anesthetic drugs is referred to as being anesthetized. Anesthesia enables the painless performance of medical procedures that would cause severe or intolerable pain to an unanesthetized patient.  Three broad categories of anaesthesia exist:General anesthesia suppresses central nervous system activity and results in unconsciousness and total lack of sensation. 

Circadian rhythm<====>56565<====>Circadian rhythm  A circadian rhythm   is any biological process that displays an endogenous, entrainable oscillation of about 24 hours.  These 24-hour rhythms are driven by a circadian clock, and they have been widely observed in plants, animals, fungi, and cyanobacteria.    The term circadian comes from the Latin circa, meaning "around" (or "approximately"), and diēm, meaning "day".  The formal study of biological temporal rhythms, such as daily, tidal, weekly, seasonal, and annual rhythms, is called chronobiology.  Processes with 24-hour oscillations are more generally called diurnal rhythms; strictly speaking, they should not be called circadian rhythms unless their endogenous nature is confirmed. 

Chronobiology<====>56566<====>Chronobiology Chronobiology is a field of biology that examines periodic (cyclic) phenomena in living organisms and their adaptation to solar- and lunar-related rhythms.These cycles are known as biological rhythms.  Chronobiology comes from the ancient Greek   (chrónos, meaning "time"), and biology, which pertains to the study, or science, of life.  The related terms chronomics and chronome have been used in some cases to describe either the molecular mechanisms involved in chronobiological phenomena or the more quantitative aspects of chronobiology, particularly where comparison of cycles between organisms is required. Chronobiological studies include but are not limited to comparative anatomy, physiology, genetics, molecular biology and behavior of organisms within biological rhythms mechanics. 

Hyperbolic function<====>56567<====>Hyperbolic function   In mathematics, hyperbolic functions are analogs of the ordinary trigonometric, or circular, functions. The basic hyperbolic functions are the hyperbolic sine "sinh" ( ),  and the hyperbolic cosine "cosh" ( ), Collins Concise Dictionary, p.  328  from which are derived the hyperbolic tangent "tanh" ( ),  hyperbolic cosecant "csch" or "cosech" (   or  ), hyperbolic secant "sech" ( ),  and hyperbolic cotangent "coth" ( ),   corresponding to the derived trigonometric functions. The inverse hyperbolic functions are the area hyperbolic sine "arsinh" (also denoted "sinh −1 ", "asinh" or sometimes "arcsinh")    and so on. 

Pleiades<====>56568<====>Pleiades  The Pleiades (  or  , also known as the Seven Sisters and Messier 45), are an open star cluster containing middle-aged, hot B-type stars located in the constellation of Taurus.  It is among the nearest star clusters to Earth and is the cluster most obvious to the naked eye in the night sky. The cluster is dominated by hot blue and extremely luminous stars that have formed within the last 100 million years.  A faint reflection nebulosity around the brightest stars was thought at first to be left over from the formation of the cluster (hence the alternative name Maia Nebula after the star Maia), but is now likely an unrelated foreground dust cloud in the interstellar medium, through which the stars are currently passing. 

Ashgabat<====>56569<====>Ashgabat   Ashgabat ( ,   ;  ) —  named Poltoratsk ( ) between 1919 and 1927, is the capital and the largest city of Turkmenistan in Central Asia, situated between the Karakum Desert  and the Kopet Dag mountain range. The city was founded in 1881, and made the capital of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic in 1924.  Much of the city was destroyed by the 1948 Ashgabat earthquake but has since seen extensive renovation under President Niyazov's urban renewal project.   The Karakum Canal runs through the city, carrying waters from the Amu Darya from east to west. 

Guignol<====>56571<====>Guignol Guignol is the main character in a French puppet show which has come to bear his name.  It represents the workers in the silk industry of France. Although often thought of as children's entertainment, Guignol's sharp wit and linguistic verve have always been appreciated by adults as well, as shown by the motto of a prominent Lyon troupe: "Guignol amuses children… and witty adults". Laurent Mourguet, Guignol's creator, was born into a family of modest silk weavers on March 3, 1769.  The certificate of his marriage to Jeanne Esterle in 1788 shows he was unable to read. 

Messier<====>56573<====>MessierMessier may refer to:People with the surnameCharles Messier, French astronomerÉric Messier, former NHL defensemanGeorge Messier, French inventorJean-Marie Messier, former CEO of Vivendi UniversalMarc Messier, Canadian actor from QuebecMark Messier, NHL forwardPaul Arthur Messier, art conservatorOther usesMessier objectMessier (crater)Messier-Dowty and preceding companies in manufacture of aircraft undercarriage 

Maria Edgeworth<====>56574<====>Maria Edgeworth   Maria Edgeworth (1 January 1768 – 22 May 1849) was a prolific Anglo-Irish writer of adults' and children's literature.  She was one of the first realist writers in children's literature and was a significant figure in the evolution of the novel in Europe.   She held advanced views, for a woman of her time, on estate management, politics and education, and corresponded with some of the leading literary and economic writers, including Sir Walter Scott and David Ricardo. LifeEarly lifeMaria Edgeworth was born at Black Bourton, Oxfordshire.  She was the second child of Richard Lovell Edgeworth (who eventually fathered 22 children by four wives) and Anna Maria Edgeworth (née Elers); Maria was thus an aunt of Francis Ysidro Edgeworth. 

Castle Rackrent<====>56575<====>Castle Rackrent Castle Rackrent, a short novel by Maria Edgeworth published in 1800, is often regarded as the first historical novel, the first regional novel in English, the first Anglo-Irish novel, the first Big House novel and the first saga novel.  Kirkpatrick, Kathryn J.  (1995) "Introduction to Castle Rackrent", Oxford, Oxford University Press It is also widely regarded as the first novel to use the device of a narrator who is both unreliable and an observer of, rather than a player in, the actions he chronicles.  Kirkpatrick suggests that it "both borrows from and originates a variety of literary genres and subgenres without neatly fitting into any one of them". 

Humphrey B. Bear<====>56576<====>Humphrey B.  Bear   Humphrey B.  Bear is an Australian children's television series and its fictional character namesake is an icon of Australian children's television.   Humphrey B.  Bear was first broadcast on Adelaide's NWS-9 on Monday, 24 May 1965.   The show became one of the most successful programs for pre-schoolers in Australia.  The part of Humphrey was originally played by Edwin "Ted" Duryea, (c. 1930-2009) an actor, singer and dancer whose human identity was never revealed. The character of Humphrey is a tall, shaggy honey-loving brown bear with a large, glossy nose, straw boater hat, tartan waist-coat and oversized yellow bow-tie. 

The Absentee<====>56577<====>The Absentee  The Absentee is a novel by Maria Edgeworth, published in 1812 in Tales of Fashionable Life, that expresses the systemic evils of the absentee landlord class of Anglo-Irish and the desperate condition of the Irish peasantry. Just before coming of age, Lord Colambre, the sensitive hero of the novel, finds that his mother Lady Clonbrony's attempts to buy her way into the high society of London are only ridiculed, while his father, Lord Clonbrony, is in serious debt as a result of his wife's lifestyle.   His mother wishes him to marry an heiress, Miss Broadhurst, who is a friend of Grace Nugent. 

Frances Burney<====>56578<====>Frances Burney  For the playwright Frances Burney (1776–1828), niece of the novelist, see Frances Burney.  Frances Burney (13 June 1752 – 6 January 1840), also known as Fanny Burney and after her marriage as Madame d'Arblay, was an English satirical novelist, diarist and playwright.  She was born in Lynn Regis, now King's Lynn, England, on 13 June 1752, to the musician and music historian Dr Charles Burney (1726–1814) and his first wife, Esther Sleepe Burney (1725–1762).  The third of six children, she was self-educated and began writing what she called her "scribblings" at the age of ten. 

Achondroplasia<====>56579<====>Achondroplasia  Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder that results in dwarfism.   The arms and legs are short, while the torso is typically of normal length.   Those affected have an average adult height of   for males and   for females.   Other features include an enlarged head and prominent forehead.   Intelligence is generally normal.   Achondroplasia is due to a mutation in the FGFR3 gene.   In about 80% of cases this occurs as a new mutation during early development.   In the other cases it is inherited from one's parents in an autosomal dominant manner. 

Khabarovsk<====>56582<====>Khabarovsk   Khabarovsk ( ;  ;  ) is the largest city and the administrative center of Khabarovsk Krai, Russia, Law #109  located   from the Chinese border, at the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri Rivers, about   north of Vladivostok.  The city also became the administrative center of the Far Eastern Federal District of Russia in 2002.  It is the second largest city in the Russian Far East, after Vladivostok.  As of the 2010 Census, its population was 577,441.    HistoryChinese early dynasties The city was originally named "Boli"（伯力 in Chinese) and was controlled by ancient miners of China. 

New General Catalogue<====>56590<====>New General Catalogue  The New General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars (abbreviated as NGC) is a catalogue of deep-sky objects compiled by John Louis Emil Dreyer in 1888 as a new version of John Herschel's General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars.  The NGC contains 7,840 objects, known as the NGC objects.  It is one of the largest comprehensive catalogues, as it includes all types of deep space objects, including galaxies, star clusters, emission nebulae and absorption nebulae.  Dreyer also published two supplements to the NGC in 1895 and 1908, known as the Index Catalogues, describing a further 5,386 astronomical objects. 

Antananarivo<====>56597<====>Antananarivo    Antananarivo, called Tananarive in French ( ) and also known by its colonial shorthand form Tana, is the capital and largest city of Madagascar.  The larger urban area surrounding the city, known as Antananarivo-Renivohitra ("Antananarivo-Mother Hill" or "Antananarivo-Capital"), is the capital of Analamanga region.  The city is located   above the sea level in the center of the island, and has been the island's largest population center since at least the 18th century. Antananarivo was historically the capital of the Merina people, who continue to form the majority of the city's estimated 1,300,000 (2013 Institut National de la Statistique, Madagascar. 

Henry Bergh<====>56598<====>Henry Bergh Henry Bergh (August 29, 1813 – March 12, 1888) founded the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) in April, 1866, three days after the first effective legislation against animal cruelty in the United States was passed into law by the New York State Legislature.  Bergh also prompted the formation, in 1874, of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (MSPCC). BiographyEarly yearsHenry Bergh was born August 29, 1813, in New York City.  His father, Christian Bergh, an ethnic German was a successful shipbuilder who had completed a series of contracts for the government. 

Fuzzy set<====>56601<====>Fuzzy setIn mathematics, fuzzy sets (aka uncertain sets) are somewhat like sets whose elements have degrees of membership.  Fuzzy sets were introduced independently by Lotfi A.  Zadeh  and Dieter Klaua  in 1965 as an extension of the classical notion of set. At the same time,   defined a more general kind of structure called an L-relation, which he studied in an abstract algebraic context.  Fuzzy relations, which are used now in different areas, such as linguistics  , decision-making  , and clustering  , are special cases of L-relations when L is the unit interval [0, 1]. 

Astana<====>56602<====>Astana   Astana ( ,   ;) is the capital city of Kazakhstan.  It is located on the banks of Ishim River in the north portion of Kazakhstan, within the Akmola Region, though administered separately from the region as a city with special status.  The 2017 census reported a population of 1,314,574 within the city limits, making it the second-largest city in Kazakhstan, behind Almaty.  Modern Astana is a planned city, like , Brasília in Brazil, Canberra in Australia, and Washington, D. C.  in the United States.After Astana became the capital of Kazakhstan, the city cardinally changed its shape. 

Inuit throat singing<====>56605<====>Inuit throat singing  Inuit throat singing, or katajjaq, is a form of musical performance uniquely found among the Inuit.

The history of Guyana has been shaped by the participation of many national and ethnic groups, as well as the colonial policies of the Spanish, French, Dutch and British.  The African slave rebellions in 1763 and 1823 were seminal moments in the nation's history.  Africans were enslaved and transported to Guyana as slaves; on the other hand, East Indians came as indentured labourers who worked in order to provide for their families back home. 

Economy of Guyana<====>56725<====>Economy of Guyana With a per capita gross domestic product of only $4,700 in 2006, Guyana is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere.  This is evident from the contrast between poor slum areas and elite residential areas with imperious mansions, often built within a few kilometres of one another.  The economy made dramatic progress after President Hoyte's 1989 economic recovery program (ERP).  As a result of the ERP, Guyana's GDP increased six percent in 1991 following 15 years of decline.  Growth was consistently above six percent until 1995, when it dipped to 5.

In 1819 the island of Funafuti, was named Ellice's Island; the name Ellice was applied to all nine islands, after the work of English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay.    The Ellice Islands came under Great Britain's sphere of influence in the late 19th century as the result of a treaty between Great Britain and Germany relating to the demarcation of the spheres of influence in the Pacific Ocean. 

History of Swaziland<====>56732<====>History of Swaziland Artifacts indicating human activity dating back to the early Stone Age have been found in the Kingdom of Swaziland.

Azeotrope<====>56778<====>Azeotrope  An azeotrope (UK  , US  )  or a constant boiling point mixture is a mixture of two or more liquids whose proportions cannot be altered or changed by simple distillation.  Moore, Walter J.  Physical Chemistry, 3rd e Prentice-Hall 1962, pp.  140–142  This happens because when an azeotrope is boiled, the vapour has the same proportions of constituents as the unboiled mixture.  Because their composition is unchanged by distillation, azeotropes are also called (especially in older texts) constant boiling point mixtures. Many azeotropic mixtures of pairs of compounds are known,  and many azeotropes of three or more compounds are also known.

Horizontal line test<====>56874<====>Horizontal line testIn mathematics, the horizontal line test is a test used to determine whether a function is injective (i. e. , one-to-one).    In calculusA horizontal line is a straight, flat line that goes from left to right.  Given a function  f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}  (i. e.  from the real numbers to the real numbers), we can decide if it is injective by looking at horizontal lines that intersect the function's graph.  If any horizontal line  y=c   intersects the graph in more than one point, the function is not injective.

Transposing instrument<====>56886<====>Transposing instrument A transposing instrument is a musical instrument whose music is recorded in staff notation at a pitch different from the pitch that actually sounds (concert pitch).  A written middle C on a transposing instrument produces a pitch other than middle C, and that pitch identifies the interval of transposition when describing the instrument.  For example, a written C on a B  clarinet sounds a concert B . Rather than a property of the instrument, the transposition is a convention of music notation.  Instruments whose music is typically notated in this way are called transposing instruments.

Carbon was an important part of Apple's strategy for bringing Mac OS X to market, offering a path for quick porting of existing software applications, as well as a means of shipping applications that would run on either Mac OS X or the classic Mac OS. 

Farmer's loop<====>56893<====>Farmer's loop The farmer's loop is a knot which forms a fixed loop.As a midline loop knot made with a bight, it is related to several other similar knots, including the alpine butterfly knot and artillery loop.If pulled from one end and that ends continuation [?????] into the loop while not tightened it may capsize to a slip knot with a complicated and heavy knot.It is tied on one hand to make a loop about twice the size of that hand (use fingers for a smaller one, thumb-hook-to-elbow for a large one), as follows:start with the rope 3 times around the palm of one hand, let the ends hang down, then pull the initial middle turn up from the top edge and place it over to the right then pull the now new middle turn up from the top edge and place it over to the left then pull the now new middle turn up from the top edge and place it over to the rightthen pull the now new middle turn up to form the loop, dress and tighten before use HistoryCornell University professor Howard W. Riley published this knot in an agricultural extension pamphlet devoted to farming knots in 1912.   He was shown the knot by a farmer at the 1910 Genesee County Fair in Bativia, New York.  Riley noted that he had never seen the knot described in any reference book.   As collected in Documents of the Assembly of the State of New York, 136th Session, 1913, Vol. 19, No. 29, Part 5.

List of cities in the Netherlands by province<====>56917<====>List of cities in the Netherlands by provinceBelow are twelve alphabetical lists of cities in the Netherlands ordered by province. City rights in the Netherlands define a place's status.  Smaller urban areas are known as dorpen.  Certain places are sometimes also considered cities especially if they historically had city rights or if they function as an urban center in a rural area; while larger population centers in densely populated areas are often neither considered a village nor a city and are usually referred to by their municipalities. When discussing cities, the distinction is sometimes made between the "big four"—Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht—middle-sized cities and other ones.

Economy of Uganda<====>56924<====>Economy of Uganda  Endowed with significant natural resources, including ample fertile land, regular rainfall, and mineral deposits, it is thought that Uganda could feed all of Africa if it were commercially farmed.   The economy of Uganda has great potential, and it appeared poised for rapid economic growth and development. Chronic political instability and erratic economic management since self-rule has produced a record of persistent economic decline that has left Uganda among the world's poorest and least-developed countries.  The national energy needs have historically been more than domestic energy generation, though large petroleum reserves have been found in the west. 

Communications in Uganda<====>56925<====>Communications in UgandaThere are a number of systems of communication in Uganda, including a system of telephony, radio and television broadcasts, internet, mail, and several newspapers.  The use of phones and the internet in Uganda has rapidly increased in the last few years. History1900 to 1970 The postal service of for the protectorates of British East Africa and Uganda was called East Africa and Uganda Protectorates, and operated from April 1, 1903 to July 22, 1920.  From 1948 to 1977, postal service in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda was provided by the East African Posts and Telecommunications Corporation.  With the decolonization of Africa, Uganda took over control of its postal system, although until 1961 stamps from the colonial postal system were being issued alongside Uganda's stamps. 

Baikal–Amur Mainline<====>56926<====>Baikal–Amur Mainline The Baikal–Amur Mainline (Russian Байкало-Амурская магистраль (БАМ), Baikalo-Amurskaya magistral , BAM) is a   broad gauge railway line in Russia.  Traversing Eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East, the   long BAM runs about 610 to 770 km (380 to 480 miles) north of and parallel to the Trans-Siberian railway. The BAM was built as a strategic alternative route to the Trans-Siberian Railway, especially along the vulnerable sections close to the border with China.   The BAM's costs were estimated at $14 billion, and it was built with special, durable tracks since much of it was built over permafrost. 

Uganda People's Defence Force<====>56928<====>Uganda People's Defence Force The Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF), previously known as the National Resistance Army, is the armed forces of Uganda.  From 2007 to 2011, the International Institute for Strategic Studies estimated the UPDF had a total strength of 40,000–45,000 and consisted of land forces and an air wing.  After Uganda achieved independence in October 1962, British officers retained most high-level military commands.  Ugandans in the rank and file claimed this policy blocked promotions and kept their salaries disproportionately low.  These complaints eventually destabilized the armed forces, already weakened by ethnic divisions.  Each post-independence regime expanded the size of the army, usually by recruiting from among people of one region or ethnic group, and each government employed military force to subdue political unrest.

Four new lines connecting to South Sudan, DRC and Tanzania.  These are Kasese-Kisangani, Gulu-Nimule-Juba, Masaka-Biharamulo and Pakwach-Juba-Wau.  Tanzania would be the main beneficiary of the new railway lines should the ambitious project materialise. Besides the Isaka-Kigali line, eight other new railway lines have been proposed within the country, linking Tanzania with other states.  These are Liganga-Mchuchuma, Mchuchuma-Mbamba Bay, Liganga-Mlimba, Dar es Salaam- Mtwara, Biharamulo-Masaka (via Bukoba), Tunduma-Kigoma (through Sumbawanga and Mpanda), Uvinza-Bujumbura and Bagamoyo-Kidomole. On 6 September, further talks took place at State House, Kampala, between Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and engineers from Germany concerning the new standard gauge railway they propose linking South Sudan's railhead at Wåw to Uganda and Kenya.  Klaus Thormahlen, managing director of Thormahlen Holdings International and Jens Flachsbarth, managing director of the Ingeno Group, presented details of the scheme envisaged.

This is complete only eastwards from the Uganda–DR Congo border to Mombasa, linking the African Great Lakes region to the sea. It is commonly called the 'Trans-Africa Highway' in Uganda.It cannot be used to reach West Africa because the route westwards across DR Congo to Bangui in the Central African Republic (CAR) is impassable after the Second Congo War and requires reconstruction. An alternative route (not part of the Trans-African network) to Bangui based on gravel roads and earth roads runs from Gulu in northern Uganda via Nimule and Juba, South Sudan and Obo in south-east CAR. This is used by trucks but sections are impassable after rain.The route has been closed at times during war and conflict in northern Uganda (the Lord's Resistance Army rebellion) and South Sudan, but up to July 2007 had not been affected by the Darfur conflict and was the only usable road between East and West Africa. The security situation should be checked with authorities in northern Uganda, South Sudan and south-eastern CAR before use.WaterwaysLake Victoria is the principal waterway with commercial traffic. In conjunction with train services, the railway companies of Uganda and Tanzania operate train ferries on the lake between railhead ports of the two countries and Kenya.  These ferries load rail coaches and wagons.  The safety record has been poor in recent years.  Jinja and Port Bell (on a 7 km branch line from Kampala) are the railheads for Uganda, connecting to Mwanza, Tanzania and Kisumu, Kenya.The Port Bell ferry wharf is visible on high-resolution Google Earth photos at latitude 0.2885° longitude 32.653°.  A ferry is shown loading truck and rail coaches while another waits.Other ferries serve non-railhead ports on the lake.Lake Kyoga and the Victoria Nile south of the lake constitute the second most important commercial waterway.  There used to be a steamboat service between Namasagali, a railhead port on the Nile, going as far as Masindi-Port on the other side of Lake Kyoga.Other waterways such as Lake Albert, Lake George, Lake Edward, and the Albert Nile do not carry commercial traffic to any great extent.AirportsMain International Airport: Entebbe International Airport and Soroti Airport46 (2012)Airports - with paved runwaystotal:5 over 3,047 m:3 1,524 to 2,437 m:1 914 to 1,523 m:1 (2012)Airports - with unpaved runwaystotal:41 2,438 to 3,047 m:1 1,524 to 2,437 m:7 914 to 1,523 m:26 under 914 m:7 (2012)See alsoUgandaEast African Railway Master PlanLake Victoria ferriesReferences    DEFAULTSORT

The Port of Aden has shown a promising recovery from a 2002 attack; container throughput increased significantly in 2004 and 2005.  However, the expected imposition of higher insurance premiums for shippers in 2006 may result in reduced future throughput. 

Geography of the European Netherlands<====>56975<====>Geography of the European Netherlands  The geography of the Netherlands in Europe is unusual in that much of its land has been reclaimed from the sea and is below sea level, protected by dikes.  Another factor that has influenced its physical appearance is that the country is among the most densely populated on Earth.  It is ranked 30th  overall on that scale, but is behind only three countries having a population over 16 million.  Consequently, the Netherlands is highly urbanized. LandscapeThe European part of the country can be split into two areas: the low and flat lands in the west and north, and the higher lands with minor hills in the east and south.

Tetryl<====>57074<====>Tetryl 2,4,6-Trinitrophenylmethylnitramine commonly referred to as tetryl (C 7 H 5 N 5 O 8 ) is an explosive compound used to make detonators and explosive booster charges. Tetryl is a nitramine booster explosive, though its use has been largely superseded by RDX.  Tetryl is a sensitive secondary high explosive used as a booster, a small charge placed next to the detonator in order to propagate detonation into the main explosive charge. Chemical propertiesTetryl is a yellow crystalline solid powder material, practically insoluble in water but soluble in acetone, benzene and other solvents.  When tetryl is heated, it first melts, then decomposes and explodes. 

HMX<====>57076<====>HMX  HMX, also called octogen, is a powerful and relatively insensitive nitroamine high explosive, chemically related to RDX.  Like RDX, the compound's name is the subject of much speculation, having been variously listed as High Melting Explosive, Her Majesty's Explosive, High-velocity Military Explosive, or High-Molecular-weight RDX.  The molecular structure of HMX consists of an eight-membered ring of alternating carbon and nitrogen atoms, with a nitro group attached to each nitrogen atom.   Because of its high molecular weight, it is one of the most potent chemical explosives manufactured, although a number of newer ones, including HNIW and ONC, are more powerful.

Dessert wine<====>57098<====>Dessert wine  Dessert wines, sometimes called pudding wines,  are sweet wines typically served with dessert. There is no simple definition of a dessert wine.  In the UK, a dessert wine is considered to be any sweet wine drunk with a meal, as opposed to the white  fortified wines (fino and amontillado sherry) drunk before the meal, and the red fortified wines (port and madeira) drunk after it.  Thus, most fortified wines are regarded as distinct from dessert wines, but some of the less strong fortified white wines, such as Pedro Ximénez sherry and Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise, are regarded as honorary dessert wines.

Radiohalo<====>57115<====>Radiohalo Radiohalos or pleochroic halos are microscopic, spherical shells of discolouration within minerals such as biotite that occur in granite and other igneous rocks.  The shells are zones of radiation damage caused by the inclusion of minute radioactive crystals within the host crystal structure.  The inclusions are typically zircon, apatite, or titanite which can accommodate uranium or thorium within their crystal structures  .   One explanation is that the discolouration is caused by alpha particles emitted by the nuclei; the radius of the concentric shells are proportional to the particle's energy  . ProductionUranium-238 follows a sequence of decay through thorium, radium, radon, polonium, and lead. 

Multiplication table<====>57122<====>Multiplication table  In mathematics, a multiplication table (sometimes, less formally, a times table) is a mathematical table used to define a multiplication operation for an algebraic system.

Today, the Cajuns make up a significant portion of south Louisiana's population and have exerted an enormous impact on the state's culture. 

HVAC<====>57169<====>HVAC  Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)  is the technology of indoor and vehicular environmental comfort.  Its goal is to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality.  HVAC system design is a subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, based on the principles of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer.  Refrigeration is sometimes added to the field's abbreviation as HVAC&R or HVACR, or ventilating is dropped, as in HACR (as in the designation of HACR-rated circuit breakers). HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large industrial and office buildings such as skyscrapers and hospitals, on ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with respect to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors. 

Peasants' Revolt<====>57172<====>Peasants' Revolt The Peasants' Revolt, also called Wat Tyler's Rebellion or the Great Rising, was a major uprising across large parts of England in 1381.  The revolt had various causes, including the socio-economic and political tensions generated by the Black Death in the 1340s, the high taxes resulting from the conflict with France during the Hundred Years' War, and instability within the local leadership of London.  The final trigger for the revolt was the intervention of a royal official, John Bampton, in Essex on 30 May 1381.  His attempts to collect unpaid poll taxes in Brentwood ended in a violent confrontation, which rapidly spread across the south-east of the country.

Middleware (distributed applications)<====>57183<====>Middleware (distributed applications) Middleware in the context of distributed applications is software that provides services beyond those provided by the operating system to enable the various components of a distributed system to communicate and manage data.  Middleware supports and simplifies complex distributed applications.  It includes web servers, application servers, messaging and similar tools that support application development and delivery.   Middleware is especially integral to modern information technology based on XML, SOAP, Web services, and service-oriented architecture. Middleware often enables interoperability between applications that run on different operating systems, by supplying services so the application can exchange data in a standards-based way. 

Verulamium<====>57185<====>Verulamium  Verulamium was a town in Roman Britain.  It was sited in the southwest of the modern city of St Albans in Hertfordshire, Great Britain.  A large portion of the Roman city remains unexcavated, being now park and agricultural land, though much has been built upon (see below).   The ancient Watling Street passed through the city.  Much of the site and its environs is now classed as a scheduled ancient monument.  HistoryBefore the Romans established their settlement, there was already a tribal centre in the area which belonged to the Catuvellauni.  This settlement is usually called Verlamion. 

Mick Jagger<====>57187<====>Mick Jagger  Sir Michael Philip Jagger, (born 26 July 1943) is an English singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, composer and actor who gained fame as the lead singer and one of the founder  members of the Rolling Stones.  Jagger's career has spanned over five decades, and he has been described as "one of the most popular and influential frontmen in the history of rock & roll".   His distinctive voice and performances, along with Keith Richards' guitar style have been the trademark of the Rolling Stones throughout the band's career.  Jagger gained press notoriety for his admitted drug use and romantic involvements, and was often portrayed as a countercultural figure. 

Muscogee<====>57190<====>Muscogee  The Muscogee, also known as the Creek and the Creek Confederacy, are a closely related group of native North American tribes or Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands.  Transcribed documents   Sequoyah Research Center and the American Native Press Archives  Mvskoke ( ;  Mvskoke   ) is their autonym.  They are originally from a single confederated native land that now comprises southern Tennessee, all of Alabama, western Georgia and part of northern Florida, Most of the original population of the Muscogee people were forcibly relocated from their native lands in the 1830s during the Trail of Tears to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). 

Indian Territory<====>57193<====>Indian Territory   As general terms, Indian Territory, the Indian Territories, or Indian country describe an evolving land area set aside by the United States Government for the relocation of Native Americans who held aboriginal title to their land.   In general, the tribes ceded land they occupied in exchange for land grants in an area purchased by the United States federal government from Napoleonic France, the Louisiana Purchase.   The concept of an Indian Territory was an outcome of the 18th- and 19th-century policy of Indian removal.   After the Civil War, the policy of the government was one of assimilation. 

Zambian kwacha<====>57195<====>Zambian kwacha The Kwacha (ISO 4217 code: ZMW) is the currency of Zambia.  It is subdivided into 100 Ngwee. EtymologyThe name 'Kwacha' derives from the Nyanja word for "dawn", alluding to the Zambian nationalist slogan of a "new dawn of freedom".  The name ngwee translates as "bright" in the Nyanja language. HistoryPrior to independence, the Rhodesia and Nyasaland pound was the legal tender of the short-lived British protectorate of Northern Rhodesia.  Banknotes of 10 shillings, 1, 5, and 10 pounds issued by the Central Africa Currency Board were in circulation, together with coins of ½, 1, 3, 6 pence, and 1, 2, 2½, and 5 shillings. 

Malawian kwacha<====>57196<====>Malawian kwacha  The kwacha ( ; ISO 4217: MWK, official name Malawi Kwacha ) is the currency of Malawi as of 1971, replacing the Malawian pound.  It is divided into 100 tambala.  The kwacha replaced other types of currency, namely the UK pound sterling, the South African rand and the Rhodesian dollar, that had previously circulated through the Malawian economy.  The exchange rate of the kwacha undergoes fixed periodical adjustments, but since 1994 the exchange rate has floated.   In 2005, administrative measures were put in place by Bingu wa Mutharika    to peg the exchange rate with other currencies.

Envelope<====>57260<====>Envelope  An envelope is a common packaging item, usually made of thin flat material.  It is designed to contain a flat object, such as a letter or card. Traditional envelopes are made from sheets of paper cut to one of three shapes: a rhombus, a short-arm cross or a kite.  These shapes allow for the creation of the envelope structure by folding the sheet sides around a central rectangular area.  In this manner, a rectangle-faced enclosure is formed with an arrangement of four flaps on the reverse side. OverviewWhen the folding sequence is such that the last flap to be closed is on a short side it is referred to in commercial envelope manufacture as a pocket - a format frequently employed in the packaging of small quantities of seeds. 

North American Industry Classification System<====>57275<====>North American Industry Classification SystemThe North American Industry Classification System or NAICS (pronounced "nakes" ) is used by business and government to classify business establishments according to type of economic activity (process of production) in Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America.

Protease<====>57285<====>ProteaseA protease (also called a peptidase or proteinase) is any enzyme that performs proteolysis; protein catabolism by hydrolysis of peptide bonds.  Proteases have evolved multiple times, and different classes of protease can perform the same reaction by completely different catalytic mechanisms.  Proteases can be found in Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Bacteria, Archaea and viruses. Hierarchy of proteasesBased on Catalytic residueProteases can be classified into seven broad groups: Serine proteases - using a serine alcoholCysteine proteases - using a cysteine thiolThreonine proteases - using a threonine secondary alcoholAspartic proteases - using an aspartate carboxylic acidGlutamic proteases - using a glutamate carboxylic acidMetalloproteases - using a metal, usually zincAsparagine peptide lyases - using an asparagine to perform an elimination reaction (not requiring water)Proteases were first grouped into 84 families according to their evolutionary relationship in 1993, and classified under four catalytic types: serine, cysteine, aspartic, and metallo proteases.

De Moivre's formula<====>57326<====>De Moivre's formulaIn mathematics, de Moivre's formula  (also known as de Moivre's theorem and de Moivre's identity), named after Abraham de Moivre, states that for any complex number (and, in particular, for any real number)   and integer   it holds that \big(\cos (x) + i \sin (x)\big)^n = \cos (nx) + i \sin (nx), where   is the imaginary unit ( ).  While the formula was named after de Moivre, he never stated it in his works.   The expression   is sometimes abbreviated to  . The formula is important because it connects complex numbers and trigonometry. 

Abraham de Moivre<====>57327<====>Abraham de Moivre   Abraham de Moivre ( ; 26 May 1667 27 November 1754) was a French mathematician known for de Moivre's formula, a formula that links complex numbers and trigonometry, and for his work on the normal distribution and probability theory.

Julius Caesar (play)<====>57328<====>Julius Caesar (play)    The Tragedy of Julius Caesar is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written in 1599. It is one of several plays written by Shakespeare based on true events from Roman history, which also include Coriolanus and Antony and Cleopatra.Although the play is named Julius Caesar, Brutus speaks more than four times as many lines as the title character; and the central psychological drama of the play focuses on Brutus' struggle between the conflicting demands of honor, patriotism, and friendship.Characters Julius CaesarTriumvirs after Caesar's deathOctavius CaesarMark AntonyLepidusConspirators against CaesarMarcus Brutus (Brutus)CassiusCascaDecius BrutusCinnaMetellus CimberTreboniusCaius LigariusTribunesFlaviusMarullusRoman Senate SenatorsCiceroPubliusPopilius LenaCitizensCalpurnia – Caesar's wifePortia – Brutus' wifeSoothsayer – a person supposed to be able to foresee the futureArtemidorus – sophist from KnidosCinna – poetCobblerCarpenterPoet (believed to be based on Marcus Favonios) Lucius – Brutus' attendantLoyal to Brutus and CassiusVolumniusTitiniusYoung Cato – Portia's brotherMessala – messengerVarrusClitusClaudioDardaniusStratoGaius Lucilius (non-speaking role)Flavius (non-speaking role)Statilius (non-speaking role)Pindarus – Cassius' bondmanOtherCaesar's servantAntony's servantOctavius' servantMessengerOther soldiers, senators, plebeians, and attendants Synopsis The play opens with two tribunes discovering the commoners of Rome celebrating Julius Caesar's triumphant return from defeating the sons of his military rival, Pompey. The tribunes, insulting the crowd for their change in loyalty from Pompey to Caesar, attempt to end the festivities and break up the commoners, who return the insults. During the feast of Lupercal, Caesar holds a victory parade and a soothsayer warns him to "Beware the ides of March", which he ignores. Meanwhile, Cassius attempts to convince Brutus to join his conspiracy to kill Caesar. Although Brutus, friendly towards Caesar, is hesitant to kill him, he agrees that Caesar may be abusing his power. They then hear from Casca that Mark Antony has offered Caesar the crown of Rome three times and that each time Caesar refused it with increasing reluctance. On the eve of the ides of March, the conspirators meet and reveal that they have forged letters of support from the Roman people to tempt Brutus into joining. Brutus reads the letters and, after much moral debate, decides to join the conspiracy, thinking that Caesar should be killed to prevent him from doing anything against the people of Rome if he were ever to be crowned.After ignoring the soothsayer, as well as his wife Calpurnia's own premonitions, Caesar goes to the Senate. The conspirators approach him with a fake petition pleading on behalf of Metellus Cimber's banished brother. As Caesar predictably rejects the petition, Casca and the others suddenly stab him; Brutus is last. At this point, Caesar utters the famous line "Et tu, Brute?"  ("And you, Brutus?", i.e. "You too, Brutus?"), concluding with "Then fall, Caesar!" The conspirators make clear that they committed this murder for the good of Rome, not for their own purposes, and do not attempt to flee the scene. Brutus delivers an oration defending his own actions, and for the moment, the crowd is on his side. However, Mark Antony makes a subtle and eloquent speech over Caesar's corpse, beginning with the much-quoted "Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!"  In this way, he deftly turns public opinion against the assassins by manipulating the emotions of the common people, in contrast to the rational tone of Brutus's speech, yet there is method in his rhetorical speech and gestures: he reminds them of the good Caesar had done for Rome, his sympathy with the poor, and his refusal of the crown at the Lupercal, thus questioning Brutus's claim of Caesar's ambition; he shows Caesar's bloody, lifeless body to the crowd to have them shed tears and gain sympathy for their fallen hero; and he reads Caesar's will, in which every Roman citizen would receive 75 drachmas. Antony, even as he states his intentions against it, rouses the mob to drive the conspirators from Rome. Amid the violence, an innocent poet, Cinna, is confused with the conspirator Lucius Cinna and is taken by the mob, which kills him for such "offenses" as his bad verses.Brutus next attacks Cassius for supposedly soiling the noble act of regicide by having accepted bribes. ("Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake? / What villain touch'd his body, that did stab, / And not for justice?" ) The two are reconciled, especially after Brutus reveals that his beloved wife committed suicide under the stress of his absence from Rome; they prepare for a civil war against Mark Antony and Caesar's adopted son, Octavius, whom have formed a triumvirate in Rome with Lepidus. That night, Caesar's ghost appears to Brutus with a warning of defeat. (He informs Brutus, "Thou shalt see me at Philippi." )At the battle, Cassius and Brutus, knowing that they will probably both die, smile their last smiles to each other and hold hands. During the battle, Cassius has his servant kill him after hearing of the capture of his best friend, Titinius. After Titinius, who was not really captured, sees Cassius's corpse, he commits suicide. However, Brutus wins that stage of the battle, but his victory is not conclusive. With a heavy heart, Brutus battles again the next day. He loses and commits suicide by running on his own sword, held for him by a loyal soldier.The play ends with a tribute to Brutus by Antony, who proclaims that Brutus has remained "the noblest Roman of them all"  because he was the only conspirator who acted, in his mind, for the good of Rome. There is then a small hint at the friction between Mark Antony and Octavius which characterises another of Shakespeare's Roman plays, Antony and Cleopatra.SourcesThe main source of the play is Thomas North's translation of Plutarch's Lives.  Deviations from PlutarchShakespeare makes Caesar's triumph take place on the day of Lupercalia (15 February) instead of six months earlier. For dramatic effect, he makes the Capitol the venue of Caesar's death rather than the Curia Pompeia (Curia of Pompey).Caesar's murder, the funeral, Antony's oration, the reading of the will and the arrival of Octavius all take place on the same day in the play. However, historically, the assassination took place on 15 March (The Ides of March), the will was published on 18 March, the funeral was on 20 March, and Octavius arrived only in May.Shakespeare makes the Triumvirs meet in Rome instead of near Bononia to avoid an additional locale.He combines the two Battles of Philippi although there was a 20-day interval between them.Shakespeare gives Caesar's last words as "Et tu, Brute? ("And you, Brutus?"). Plutarch and Suetonius  each report that he said nothing, with Plutarch adding that he pulled his toga over his head when he saw Brutus among the conspirators,  though Suetonius does record other reports that Caesar said in Greek "καὶ σὺ, τέκνον;" (Kai su, teknon?, "And you, child?")   The Latin words Et tu, Brute?, however, were not devised by Shakespeare for this play since they are attributed to Caesar in earlier Elizabethan works and had become conventional by 1599.Shakespeare deviated from these historical facts to curtail time and compress the facts so that the play could be staged more easily. The tragic force is condensed into a few scenes for heightened effect.Date and textJulius Caesar was originally published in the First Folio of 1623, but a performance was mentioned by Thomas Platter the Younger in his diary in September 1599. The play is not mentioned in the list of Shakespeare's plays published by Francis Meres in 1598. Based on these two points, as well as a number of contemporary allusions, and the belief that the play is similar to Hamlet in vocabulary, and to Henry V and As You Like It in metre,  scholars have suggested 1599 as a probable date. The text of Julius Caesar in the First Folio is the only authoritative text for the play. The Folio text is notable for its quality and consistency; scholars judge it to have been set into type from a theatrical prompt-book. The play contains many anachronistic elements from the Elizabethan era. The characters mention objects such as hats and doublets (large, heavy jackets) – neither of which existed in ancient Rome. Caesar is mentioned to be wearing an Elizabethan doublet instead of a Roman toga. At one point a clock is heard to strike and Brutus notes it with "Count the clock".Analysis and criticismHistorical backgroundMaria Wyke has written that the play reflects the general anxiety of Elizabethan England over succession of leadership. At the time of its creation and first performance, Queen Elizabeth, a strong ruler, was elderly and had refused to name a successor, leading to worries that a civil war similar to that of Rome might break out after her death. Protagonist debateCritics of Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar differ greatly on their views of Caesar and Brutus. Many have debated whether Caesar or Brutus is the protagonist of the play, because of the title character's death in Act Three, Scene One. But Caesar compares himself to the Northern Star, and perhaps it would be foolish not to consider him as the axial character of the play, around whom the entire story turns. Intertwined in this debate is a smattering of philosophical and psychological ideologies on republicanism and monarchism. One author, Robert C. Reynolds, devotes attention to the names or epithets given to both Brutus and Caesar in his essay "Ironic Epithet in Julius Caesar". This author points out that Casca praises Brutus at face value, but then inadvertently compares him to a disreputable joke of a man by calling him an alchemist, "Oh, he sits high in all the people's hearts,/And that which would appear offence in us/ His countenance, like richest alchemy,/ Will change to virtue and to worthiness" (I.iii.158-60). Reynolds also talks about Caesar and his "Colossus" epithet, which he points out has its obvious connotations of power and manliness, but also lesser known connotations of an outward glorious front and inward chaos. Myron Taylor, in his essay "Shakespeare's Julius Caesar and the Irony of History", compares the logic and philosophies of Caesar and Brutus. Caesar is deemed an intuitive philosopher who is always right when he goes with his instinct, for instance when he says he fears Cassius as a threat to him before he is killed, his intuition is correct. Brutus is portrayed as a man similar to Caesar, but whose passions lead him to the wrong reasoning, which he realises in the end when he says in V.v.50–51, "Caesar, now be still:/ I kill'd not thee with half so good a will". Joseph W. Houppert acknowledges that some critics have tried to cast Caesar as the protagonist, but that ultimately Brutus is the driving force in the play and is therefore the tragic hero. Brutus attempts to put the republic over his personal relationship with Caesar and kills him. Brutus makes the political mistakes that bring down the republic that his ancestors created. He acts on his passions, does not gather enough evidence to make reasonable decisions and is manipulated by Cassius and the other conspirators. Traditional readings of the play may maintain that Cassius and the other conspirators are motivated largely by envy and ambition, whereas Brutus is motivated by the demands of honour and patriotism. Certainly, this is the view that Antony expresses in the final scene. But one of the central strengths of the play is that it resists categorising its characters as either simple heroes or villains. The political journalist and classicist Garry Wills maintains that "This play is distinctive because it has no villains".   It is a drama famous for the difficulty of deciding which role to emphasise. The characters rotate around each other like the plates of a Calder mobile. Touch one and it affects the position of all the others. Raise one, another sinks. But they keep coming back into a precarious balance.  Wills' contemporary interpretation leans more toward recognition of the conscious, sub-conscious nature of human actions and interactions. In this, the role of Cassius becomes paramount.Performance historyThe play was likely one of Shakespeare's first to be performed at the Globe Theatre.  Thomas Platter the Younger, a Swiss traveller, saw a tragedy about Julius Caesar at a Bankside theatre on 21 September 1599, and this was most likely Shakespeare's play, as there is no obvious alternative candidate. (While the story of Julius Caesar was dramatised repeatedly in the Elizabethan/Jacobean period, none of the other plays known are as good a match with Platter's description as Shakespeare's play.) After the theatres re-opened at the start of the Restoration era, the play was revived by Thomas Killigrew's King's Company in 1672. Charles Hart initially played Brutus, as did Thomas Betterton in later productions. Julius Caesar was one of the very few Shakespearean plays that was not adapted during the Restoration period or the eighteenth century. Notable performances1864: Junius, Jr., Edwin and John Wilkes Booth (later the assassin of U.S. president Abraham Lincoln) made the only appearance onstage together in a benefit performance of Julius Caesar on 25 November 1864, at the Winter Garden Theater in New York City. Junius, Jr. played Cassius, Edwin played Brutus and John Wilkes played Mark Antony. This landmark production raised funds to erect a statue of Shakespeare in Central Park, which remains to this day.May 29, 1916: A one-night performance in the natural bowl of Beachwood Canyon, Hollywood drew an audience of 40,000 and starred Tyrone Power, Sr. and Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. The student bodies of Hollywood and Fairfax High Schools played opposing armies, and the elaborate battle scenes were performed on a huge stage as well as the surrounding hillsides. The play commemorated the tercentenary of Shakespeare's death. A photograph of the elaborate stage and viewing stands can be seen on the Library of Congress website. The performance was lauded by L. Frank Baum. 1926: Another elaborate performance of the play was staged as a benefit for the Actors Fund of America at the Hollywood Bowl. Caesar arrived for the Lupercal in a chariot drawn by four white horses. The stage was the size of a city block and dominated by a central tower eighty feet in height. The event was mainly aimed at creating work for unemployed actors. Three hundred gladiators appeared in an arena scene not featured in Shakespeare's play; a similar number of girls danced as Caesar's captives; a total of three thousand soldiers took part in the battle sequences.1937: Caesar, Orson Welles's famous Mercury Theatre production, drew fevered comment as the director dressed his protagonists in uniforms reminiscent of those common at the time in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, drawing a specific analogy between Caesar and Fascist Italian leader Benito Mussolini. Time magazine gave the production a rave review,  together with the New York critics.The fulcrum of the show was the slaughter of Cinna the Poet (Norman Lloyd), a scene that literally stopped the show.  Caesar opened at the Mercury Theatre in New York City in November 1937and moved to the larger National Theater in January 1938,   running a total of 157 performances.  A second company made a five-month national tour with Caesar in 1938, again to critical acclaim.    1950: John Gielgud played Cassius at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre under the direction of Michael Langham and Anthony Quayle. The production was considered one of the highlights of a remarkable Stratford season and led to Gielgud (who had done little film work to that time) playing Cassius in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's 1953 film version.1977: Gielgud made his final appearance in a Shakespearean role on stage as Caesar in John Schlesinger's production at the Royal National Theatre. The cast also included Ian Charleson as Octavius.1994: Arvind Gaur directed the play in India with Jaimini Kumar as Brutus and Deepak Ochani as Caesar (24 shows); later on he revived it with Manu Rishi as Caesar and Vishnu Prasad as Brutus for the Shakespeare Drama Festival, Assam in 1998. Arvind Kumar translated Julius Caesar into Hindi. This production was also performed at the Prithvi international theatre festival, at the India Habitat Centre, New Delhi.2005: Denzel Washington played Brutus in the first Broadway production of the play in over fifty years. The production received universally negative reviews but was a sell-out because of Washington's popularity at the box office. 2012: The Royal Shakespeare Company staged an all-black production under the direction of Gregory Doran.2012: An all-female production starring Harriet Walter as Brutus and Frances Barber as Caesar was staged at the Donmar Warehouse, directed by Phyllida Lloyd. In October 2013, the production transferred to New York's St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn.2018: The Bridge Theatre stages Julius Caesar as one of its first productions, under the direction of Nicholas Hytner, with Ben Whishaw and David Morrissey as leads.  This mirrors the play's status as one of the first productions at the Globe Theatre in 1599.Adaptations and cultural referencesOne of the earliest cultural references to the play came in Shakespeare's own Hamlet. Prince Hamlet asks Polonius about his career as a thespian at university, Polonius replies "I did enact Julius Caesar. I was killed i' th' Capitol. Brutus killed me." This is a likely meta-reference, as Richard Burbage is generally accepted to have played leading men Brutus and Hamlet, and the older John Heminges to have played Caesar and Polonius.In 1851, the German composer Robert Schumann wrote a concert overture Julius Caesar, inspired by Shakespeare's play.  Other musical settings include those by Giovanni Bononcini, Hans von Bülow, Felix Draeseke, Josef Bohuslav Foerster, John Ireland, John Foulds, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Manfred Gurlitt, Darius Milhaud, and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco. The Canadian comedy duo Wayne and Shuster parodied Julius Caesar in their 1958 sketch Rinse the Blood off My Toga. Flavius Maximus, Private Roman Eye, is hired by Brutus to investigate the death of Caesar. The police procedural combines Shakespeare, Dragnet, and vaudeville jokes and was first broadcast on The Ed Sullivan Show. In 1984, the Riverside Shakespeare Company of New York City produced a modern dress Julius Caesar set in contemporary Washington, called simply CAESAR!, starring Harold Scott as Brutus, Herman Petras as Caesar, Marya Lowry as Portia, Robert Walsh as Antony, and Michael Cook as Cassius, directed by W. Stuart McDowell at The Shakespeare Center. In 2006, Chris Taylor from the Australian comedy team The Chaser wrote a comedy musical called Dead Caesar which was shown at the Sydney Theatre Company in Sydney.The line "The Evil That Men Do", from the speech made by Mark Antony following Caesar's death ("The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interred with their bones.") has had many references in media, including the titles of ...An Iron Maiden songA politically oriented film directed by J. Lee Thompson in 1984A Buffy the Vampire Slayer novel.The 2008 movie Me and Orson Welles, based on a book of the same name by Robert Kaplow, is a fictional story centred around Orson Welles' famous 1937 production of Julius Caesar at the Mercury Theatre. British actor Christian McKay is cast as Welles, and co-stars with Zac Efron and Claire Danes.The 2012 Italian drama film Caesar Must Die ( ), directed by Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, follows convicts in their rehearsals ahead of a prison performance of Julius Caesar.In the Ray Bradbury book Fahrenheit 451, some of the character Beatty's last words are "There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, for I am armed so strong in honesty that they pass me as an idle wind, which I respect not!"The play's line "the fault, dear Brutus, lies not in our stars, but in ourselves", spoken by Cassius in Act I, scene 2, is often referenced in popular culture. The line gave its name to the J.M. Barrie play Dear Brutus, and also gave its name to the best selling young adult novel The Fault in Our Stars by John Green and its film adaptation. The same line was quoted in Edward R. Murrow's epilogue of his famous 1954 See It Now documentary broadcast concerning Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. This speech and the line were recreated in the 2005 film Good Night, and Good Luck. It was also quoted by George Clooney's character in the Coen brothers film Intolerable Cruelty.The line "And therefore think him as a serpent's egg / Which hatch'd, would, as his kind grow mischievous; And kill him in the shell." spoken by Brutus in Act II, Scene 1, is referenced in the Dead Kennedys song, "California Über Alles".The Agatha Christie novel Taken At The Flood is entitled There is a Tide in its American Edition. Both the UK and the US titles refer to an iconic line of Brutus: "There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune” (Act-IV, Scene-III).Film and television adaptations Julius Caesar has been adapted to a number of film productions, including:Julius Caesar (Vitagraph Company of America, 1908), produced by J. Stuart Blackton and directed by William V. Ranous, who also played Anthony. Julius Caesar (Avon Productions, 1949), directed by David Bradley, who played Brutus; Charlton Heston played Antony and Harold Tasker played Caesar.

Julius Caesar (MGM, 1953), directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and produced by John Houseman; starring James Mason as Brutus, Marlon Brando as Antony and Louis Calhern as Caesar. An Honourable Murder (1960), directed by Godfrey Grayson;  depicted the play in a modern business setting. The Spread of the Eagle, a 1963 BBC series comprising Coriolanus, Julius Caesar, and Antony & Cleopatra.Julius Caesar (Commonwealth United, 1969), directed by Stuart Burge, produced by Peter Snell, starring Jason Robards as Brutus, Charlton Heston as Antony and John Gielgud as Caesar. Heil Caesar (BBC, 1973), a three-part television play written by John Griffith Bowen that was "a modern-dress modern-dialogue rewrite of the play, updated to an unnamed present-day regime that's about to switch from democracy to dictatorship unless Brutus and his conspirators act to prevent it." It was intended as an introduction to Shakespeare's play for schoolchildren, but it proved good enough to be shown on adult television, and a stage version was later produced.  The British Universities Film & Video Council database states that the work "transforms the play into a modern political conspiracy thriller with modern dialogue and many strong allusions to political events in the early 1970." Julius Caesar (BBC/Time-Life TV, 1978), a television adaptation directed by Herbert Wise and produced by Cedric Messina, starring Richard Pasco as Brutus, Keith Michell as Antony and Charles Gray as Caesar. Zulfiqar (2016), a Bengali-language Indian film by Srijit Mukherji that is an adaption of both Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra and a tribute to the film The Godfather. Contemporary political referencesModern adaptions of the play have often made contemporary political references, Peter Marks, When 'Julius Caesar' was given a Trumpian makeover, people lost it. But is it any good, Washington Post (June 16, 2017).  with Caesar depicted as resembling a variety of political leaders, including Huey Long, Margaret Thatcher, and Tony Blair. Frank Pallotta, Trump-like 'Julius Caesar' isn't the first time the play has killed a contemporary politician, CNN (June 12, 2017).  Professor A. J. Hartley, the Robinson Chair of Shakespeare Studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, states that this is fairly "common trope" of Julius Caesar performances: "Throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, the rule has been to create a recognisable political world within the production. And often people in the title role itself look like or feel like somebody either in recent or current politics."  A 2012 production of Julius Caesar by the Guthrie Theatre and The Acting Company "presented Caesar in the guise of a black actor who was meant to suggest President Obama."  This production was not particularly controversial.  In 2017, however, a modern adaptation of the play at New York's Shakespeare in the Park (performed by The Public Theater) depicted Caesar with the likeness of President Donald Trump and thereby aroused ferocious controversy, drawing criticism by right-wing media such as The Daily Caller and Breitbart and prompting corporate sponsors Bank of America and Delta Airlines to pull their financial support.The Public Theater stated that the message of the play is not pro-assassination and that the point is that "those who attempt to defend democracy by undemocratic means pay a terrible price and destroy the very thing they are fighting to save." Shakespeare scholars Stephen Greenblatt  and Peter Holland agreed with this statement.  Pallotta stated that "I have never read anyone suggesting that 'Julius Caesar' is a play that recommends assassination. Look what happens: Caesar is assassinated to stop him becoming a dictator. Result: civil war, massive slaughter, creation of an emperor, execution of many who sympathized with the conspiracy. Doesn't look much like a successful result for the conspirators to me."  The play was interrupted several times by right-wing protesters, who accused the play of "violence against the right", and actors and members of theatres with Shakespeare in the name has been harassed and received death threats, including the wife of the play's director Oskar Eustis.The protests were praised by American Family Association director Sandy Rios who compared the play with the execution of Christians by damnatio ad bestias.

Circulatory system<====>57330<====>Circulatory systemThe circulatory system, also called the cardiovascular system or the vascular system, is an organ system that permits blood to circulate and transport nutrients (such as amino acids and electrolytes), oxygen, carbon dioxide, hormones, and blood cells to and from the cells in the body to provide nourishment and help in fighting diseases,  stabilize temperature and pH, and maintain homeostasis. The circulatory system includes the lymphatic system, which circulates lymph.The passage of lymph for example takes much longer than that of blood.Blood is a fluid consisting of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets that is circulated by the heart through the vertebrate vascular system, carrying oxygen and nutrients to and waste materials away from all body tissues. 

Microwave auditory effect<====>57331<====>Microwave auditory effect The microwave auditory effect, also known as the microwave hearing effect or the Frey effect, consists of audible clicks (or, with speech modulation, spoken words ) induced by pulsed/modulated  microwave frequencies.  The clicks are generated directly inside the human head without the need of any receiving electronic device.  The effect was first reported by persons working in the vicinity of radar transponders during World War II.   During the Cold War era, the American neuroscientist Allan H.  Frey studied this phenomenon and was the first to publish  information on the nature of the microwave auditory effect.

Yangon boasts the largest number of colonial-era buildings in Southeast Asia,    and has a unique colonial-era urban core that is remarkably intact. 

SISAL<====>57406<====>SISAL  SISAL ("Streams and Iteration in a Single Assignment Language") is a general-purpose single assignment functional programming language with strict semantics, implicit parallelism, and efficient array handling.  SISAL outputs a dataflow graph in Intermediary Form 1 (IF1).  It was derived from VAL (Value-oriented Algorithmic Language, designed by Jack Dennis), and adds recursion and finite streams.  It has a Pascal-like syntax and was designed to be a common high-level language for numerical programs on a variety of multiprocessors. HistorySISAL was defined in 1983 by James McGraw et al. , at the University of Manchester, LLNL, Colorado State University and DEC. 

Sisal<====>57409<====>Sisal  Sisal ( ,   ), with the botanical name Agave sisalana, is a species of Agave native to southern Mexico but widely cultivated and naturalized in many other countries.  It yields a stiff fibre used in making various products.  The term sisal may refer either to the plant's common name or the fibre, depending on the context.  It is sometimes referred to as "sisal hemp", because for centuries hemp was a major source for fibre, and other fibre sources were named after it. The sisal fibre is traditionally used for rope and twine, and has many other uses, including paper, cloth, footwear, hats, bags, carpets, and dartboards. 

Multiplication algorithm<====>57411<====>Multiplication algorithmA multiplication algorithm is an algorithm (or method) to multiply two numbers.  Depending on the size of the numbers, different algorithms are in use.  Efficient multiplication algorithms have existed since the advent of the decimal system. Grid method The grid method (or box method) is an introductory method for multiple-digit multiplication that is often taught to pupils at primary school or elementary school level.   It has been a standard part of the national primary-school mathematics curriculum in England and Wales since the late 1990s.  Both factors are broken up ("partitioned") into their hundreds, tens and units parts, and the products of the parts are then calculated explicitly in a relatively simple multiplication-only stage, before these contributions are then totalled to give the final answer in a separate addition stage. 

Rambutan<====>57413<====>Rambutan    The rambutan ( , taxonomic name: Nephelium lappaceum) is a medium-sized tropical tree in the family Sapindaceae.  The name also refers to the edible fruit produced by this tree.  The rambutan is native to the Malay-Indonesian region,  and other regions of tropical Southeast Asia.It is closely related to several other edible tropical fruits including the lychee, longan, and mamoncillo.   EtymologyThe name "rambutan" is derived from the Malay-Indonesian languages word for rambut or "hair", a reference to the numerous hairy protuberances of the fruit, together with the noun-building suffix -an. 

Evolutionary developmental biology<====>57414<====>Evolutionary developmental biology Evolutionary developmental biology (informally, evo-devo) is a field of biological research that compares the developmental processes of different organisms to infer the ancestral relationships between them and how developmental processes evolved. The field grew from 19th century beginnings, where embryology faced a mystery: zoologists did not know how embryonic development was controlled at the molecular level.  Charles Darwin noted that having similar embryos implied common ancestry, but little progress was made until the 1970s.  Then, recombinant DNA technology at last brought embryology together with molecular genetics.  A key early discovery was of homeotic genes that regulate development in a wide range of eukaryotes. 

Przewalski's horse<====>57416<====>Przewalski's horse  The Przewalski's horse (   ;   ; Khalkha  , takhi; Ak Kaba Tuvan: [ ] dagy; Equus ferus przewalskii)  or Dzungarian horse, is a rare and endangered subspecies of wild horse (Equus ferus) native to the steppes of central Asia.   At one time extinct in the wild (in Mongolia, the last wild Przewalski's horses had been seen in 1966), it has been reintroduced to its native habitat in Mongolia at the Khustain Nuruu National Park, Takhin Tal Nature Reserve, and Khomiin Tal.   The taxonomic position is still debated, and some taxonomists treat Przewalski's horse as a species, Equus przewalskii. 

Capsaicin<====>57421<====>Capsaicin   Capsaicin (  (INN); 8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) is an active component of chili peppers, which are plants belonging to the genus Capsicum.  It is an irritant for mammals, including humans, and produces a sensation of burning in any tissue with which it comes into contact.  Capsaicin and several related compounds are called capsaicinoids and are produced as secondary metabolites by chili peppers, probably as deterrents against certain mammals and fungi.  What Made Chili Peppers So Spicy? Talk of the Nation, 15 August 2008.   Pure capsaicin is a   hydrophobic, colorless, highly pungent,  crystalline to waxy compound. 

Drupe<====>57425<====>Drupe In botany, a drupe (or stone fruit) is an indehiscent fruit in which an outer fleshy part (exocarp, or skin; and mesocarp, or flesh) surrounds a single shell (the pit, stone, or pyrene) of hardened endocarp with a seed (kernel) inside. These fruits usually develop from a single carpel, and mostly from flowers with superior ovaries  (polypyrenous drupes are exceptions).  The definitive characteristic of a drupe is that the hard, "lignified" stone (or pit) is derived from the ovary wall of the flower—in an aggregate fruit composed of small, individual drupes (such as a raspberry), each individual is termed a drupelet and may together form a botanic berry.

Antler<====>57500<====>Antler    Antlers are extensions of an animal's skull found in members of the deer family.  They are true bone and are a single structure.  They are generally found only on males, with the exception of the caribou.   Antlers are shed and regrown each year and function primarily as objects of sexual attraction and as weapons in fights between males for control of harems. In contrast, horns, found on pronghorn, sheep, goats, bison, cattle, and many other bovine, are two-part structures.  An interior of bone (also an extension of the skull) is covered by an exterior sheath grown by specialized hair follicles, the same material as human fingernails and toenails.

Situationist International<====>57521<====>Situationist International  The Situationist International (SI) was an international organization of social revolutionaries made up of avant-garde artists, intellectuals, and political theorists, prominent in Europe from its formation in 1957 to its dissolution in 1972.    The intellectual foundations of the Situationist International were derived primarily from anti-authoritarian Marxism and the avant-garde art movements of the early 20th century, particularly Dada and Surrealism.   Overall, situationist theory represented an attempt to synthesize this diverse field of theoretical disciplines into a modern and comprehensive critique of mid-20th century advanced capitalism.   The situationists recognized that capitalism had changed since Marx's formative writings, but maintained that his analysis of the capitalist mode of production remained fundamentally correct; they rearticulated and expanded upon several classical Marxist concepts, such as his theory of alienation. 

Einkorn wheat<====>57522<====>Einkorn wheat Einkorn wheat (from German Einkorn, literally "single grain") can refer either to the wild species of wheat, Triticum boeoticum, or to the domesticated form, Triticum monococcum.  The wild and domesticated forms are either considered separate species, as here, or as subspecies: Triticum monococcum subsp.  boeoticum (wild) and T.  monococcum subsp.  monococcum (domesticated).  Einkorn is a diploid species (2n = 14 chromosomes) of hulled wheat, with tough glumes ('husks') that tightly enclose the grains.  The cultivated form is similar to the wild, except that the ear stays intact when ripe and the seeds are larger. 

Péclet number<====>57526<====>Péclet numberThe Péclet number (Pe) is a class of dimensionless numbers relevant in the study of transport phenomena in a continuum.  It is named after the French physicist Jean Claude Eugène Péclet.  It is defined to be the ratio of the rate of advection of a physical quantity by the flow to the rate of diffusion of the same quantity driven by an appropriate gradient.  In the context of species or mass transfer, the Péclet number is the product of the Reynolds number and the Schmidt number.  In the context of the thermal fluids, the thermal Peclet number is equivalent to the product of the Reynolds number and the Prandtl number. 

Jean Claude Eugène Péclet<====>57528<====>Jean Claude Eugène Péclet Jean Claude Eugène Péclet (10 February 1793 – 6 December 1857) was a French physicist. He was born in Besançon, France. Péclet became, in 1812, one of the first students of the École Normale in Paris with Gay-Lussac and Dulong being his professors.  In 1816, he was elected professor at the Collège de Marseille and taught physical sciences there until 1827.  Being nominated maître de conférences at the École Normale, he returned to Paris.  In 1829, he became a professor of physics at the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures that was being founded by the businessman  Alphonse Lavallée, by Péclet, and by three other scientists, Philippe Benoît, Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Théodore Olivier.

Ishikawa diagram<====>57535<====>Ishikawa diagram Ishikawa diagrams (also called fishbone diagrams, herringbone diagrams, cause-and-effect diagrams, or Fishikawa) are causal diagrams created by Kaoru Ishikawa († 1968) that show the causes of a specific event.   Common uses of the Ishikawa diagram are product design and quality defect prevention to identify potential factors causing an overall effect.  Each cause or reason for imperfection is a source of variation.  Causes are usually grouped into major categories to identify and classify these sources of variation. OverviewThe defect is shown as the fish's head, facing to the right, with the causes extending to the left as fishbones; the ribs branch off the backbone for major causes, with sub-branches for root-causes, to as many levels as required.

The Munich Putsch.  schoolshistory. org. uk, accessed 2008-05-31.    and, in German, as the Hitlerputsch or Hitler-Ludendorff-Putsch, was a failed coup attempt by the Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler — along with Generalquartiermeister Erich Ludendorff and other Kampfbund leaders — to seize power in Munich, Bavaria, during 8–9 November 1923.  About two thousand Nazis marched to the centre of Munich, where they confronted the police, which resulted in the death of 16 Nazis and four police officers.   Hitler himself was not wounded during the clash, although he locked his left arm with the right arm of Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter who, when he was shot and killed, pulled Hitler to the pavement with him. 

Ulysses (spacecraft)<====>57539<====>Ulysses (spacecraft)  Ulysses is a decommissioned robotic space probe whose primary mission was to orbit the Sun and study it at all latitudes.  It was launched in 1990, made three "fast latitude scans" of the Sun in 1994/1995, 2000/2001, and 2007/2008.  In addition, the probe studied several comets.  Ulysses was a joint venture of NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) with participation from Canada's National Research Council.   The last day for mission operations on Ulysses was June 30, 2009.   To study the Sun at all latitudes the probe needed to change its orbital inclination and leave the plane of the Solar System – to change the orbital inclination of a spacecraft a large change in heliocentric velocity is needed.

Yerkes was a pioneer in the study both of human and primate intelligence and of the social behavior of gorillas and chimpanzees.   Along with John D.  Dodson, Yerkes developed the Yerkes-Dodson law relating arousal to performance. As time went on, however, Yerkes began to propagate his support for eugenics in the 1910s and 1920s.  His works are largely considered biased toward outmoded racialist theories by modern anthropologists and academics.

Charles Edward Stuart<====>57550<====>Charles Edward StuartCharles Edward Louis John Casimir Sylvester Severino Maria Stuart (31 December 1720 – 31 January 1788), commonly known in Britain during his lifetime as The Young Pretender and The Young Chevalier, and often known in retrospective accounts as Bonnie Prince Charlie, was the second Jacobite pretender to the thrones of England, Scotland, Ireland (as Charles III) from the death of his father in 1766.  This claim was based on his status as the eldest son of James Francis Edward Stuart, himself the son of James II and VII.  Charles is perhaps best known as the instigator of the unsuccessful Jacobite uprising of 1745, in which he led an insurrection to restore his family to the throne of Great Britain. 

Third Punic War<====>57551<====>Third Punic War   The Third Punic War (Latin: Tertium Bellum Punicum) (149–146 BC) was the third and last of the Punic Wars fought between the former Phoenician colony of Carthage and the Roman Republic.  The Punic Wars were named because of the Roman name for Carthaginians: Punici, or Poenici.  This war was a much smaller engagement than the two previous Punic Wars and focused on Tunisia, mainly on the Siege of Carthage, which resulted in the complete destruction of the city, the annexation of all remaining Carthaginian territory by Rome, and the death or enslavement of the entire Carthaginian population. 

Carolina shag<====>57553<====>Carolina shagThe 'Carolina Shag' is a partner dance done primarily to Beach Music (100-130+ beats per minute in 4/4 time signature).    Today, the Shag is a recognized dance in national and international dance competitions held across the United States. TechniqueThe basic step in Carolina Shag is a six-count, eight-step pattern danced in a slot.  The rhythm is similar to six-count Swing in that it is triple step, triple step, rock step or counted as "one-and-two, three-and-four, five-six".    There are eight shag dance steps in the basic pattern.  The "one-and-two" and "three-and-four" steps should take about as much time to complete as the "five-six. 

Flagstaff, Arizona<====>57554<====>Flagstaff, Arizona  Flagstaff is a city in and the county seat of Coconino County    in northern Arizona, in the southwestern United States.  In 2015, the city's estimated population was 70,320.Flagstaff's combined metropolitan area has an estimated population of 139,097.  The city is named after a ponderosa pine flagpole made by a scouting party from Boston (known as the "Second Boston Party") to celebrate the United States Centennial on July 4, 1876.  Flagstaff lies near the southwestern edge of the Colorado Plateau, along the western side of the largest contiguous ponderosa pine forest in the continental United States. 

Acid dissociation constant<====>57555<====>Acid dissociation constant  An acid dissociation constant, K a , (also known as acidity constant, or acid-ionization constant) is a quantitative measure of the strength of an acid in solution. It is the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction known as dissociation in the context of acid–base reactions. Some chemists maintain that a dissociation occurs when two or more ionic species separate from one another (such as occurs during dissolution of an ionic solid) but that the formation of one or more ions is properly an ionization process.  Thus, sodium chloride solid dissociates in water whereas hydrogen chloride gas ionizes in water as the former already has an ionic structure whereas the later is a molecular substance with a covalent bond between the hydrogen and chlorine atoms and the gas does not consist of ions:NaCl(s)   →   Na + (aq)   +   Cl − (aq)HCl(g)   + H 2 O   →   H 3 O + (aq)   +   Cl − (aq)From this perspective, K a  is actually an acid ionization constant and not an acid dissociation constant, but for most practical purposes, the terms are used interchangeably.  In aqueous solution, the equilibrium of acid dissociation can be written symbolically as: \mathrm{HA + H_2O \rightleftharpoons A^- + H_3O^+} where HA is a generic acid that dissociates into A − , known as the conjugate base of the acid and a hydrogen ion which combines with a water molecule to make a hydronium ion. In the example shown in the figure, HA represents acetic acid, and A −  represents the acetate ion, the conjugate base.The chemical species HA, A −  and H 3 O +  are said to be in equilibrium when their concentrations do not change with the passing of time. The dissociation constant is usually written as a quotient of the equilibrium concentrations (in mol/L), denoted by [HA], [A − ] and [H 3 O + ] K_\mathrm{a} = \mathrm{\frac{[A^-] [H_3O^+]}{[HA][H_2O]}} In all but the most concentrated aqueous solutions of an acid the concentration of water can be taken as constant and can be ignored. The definition can then be written more simply \mathrm{HA \rightleftharpoons A^- + H^+}: K_{\mathrm a} = \mathrm{\frac{[A^-][H^+]}{[HA]}}  This is the definition in common usage. For many practical purposes it is more convenient to discuss the logarithmic constant, pK a  \mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a} = - \log_{10}\left(K_\mathrm{a}\right)  pK a  is sometimes referred to as an acid dissociation constant, but this is incorrect, strictly speaking, as the constant is K a  whereas pK a  is the logarithm of the reciprocal of that constant. The more positive the value of pK a , the smaller the extent of dissociation at any given pH (see Henderson–Hasselbalch equation)—that is, the weaker the acid. A weak acid has a pK a  value in the approximate range −2 to 12 in water. Acids with a pK a  value of less than about −2 are said to be strong acids; the dissociation of a strong acid is effectively complete such that concentration of the undissociated acid is too small to be measured. pK a  values for strong acids can, however, be estimated by theoretical means.The definition can be extended to non-aqueous solvents, such as acetonitrile and dimethylsulfoxide. Denoting a solvent molecule by S \mathrm{HA +S \rightleftharpoons A^- + SH^+}; K_\mathrm{a} = \mathrm{\frac{[A^-] [SH^+]}{[HA][S]}} When the concentration of solvent molecules can be taken to be constant,  K_\mathrm{a} = \mathrm{\frac{[A^-][H^+]}{[HA]}}  , as before.Theoretical backgroundThe acid dissociation constant for an acid is a direct consequence of the underlying thermodynamics of the dissociation reaction; the pK a  value is directly proportional to the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction. The value of the pK a  changes with temperature and can be understood qualitatively based on Le Châtelier's principle: when the reaction is endothermic, K a  increases and pK a  decreases with increasing temperature; the opposite is true for exothermic reactions.The value of pK a  also depends on molecular structure of the acid in many ways. For example, Pauling proposed two rules: one for successive pK a  of polyprotic acids (see Polyprotic acids below), and one to estimate the pK a  of oxyacids based on the number of =O and −OH groups (see Factors that affect pK a  values below). Other structural factors that influence the magnitude of the acid dissociation constant include inductive effects, mesomeric effects, and hydrogen bonding. Hammett type equations have frequently been applied to the estimation of pK a . The quantitative behaviour of acids and bases in solution can be understood only if their pK a  values are known. In particular, the pH of a solution can be predicted when the analytical concentration and pK a  values of all acids and bases are known; conversely, it is possible to calculate the equilibrium concentration of the acids and bases in solution when the pH is known. These calculations find application in many different areas of chemistry, biology, medicine, and geology. For example, many compounds used for medication are weak acids or bases, and a knowledge of the pK a  values, together with the water–octanol partition coefficient, can be used for estimating the extent to which the compound enters the blood stream. Acid dissociation constants are also essential in aquatic chemistry and chemical oceanography, where the acidity of water plays a fundamental role. In living organisms, acid–base homeostasis and enzyme kinetics are dependent on the pK a  values of the many acids and bases present in the cell and in the body. In chemistry, a knowledge of pK a  values is necessary for the preparation of buffer solutions and is also a prerequisite for a quantitative understanding of the interaction between acids or bases and metal ions to form complexes. Experimentally, pK a  values can be determined by potentiometric (pH) titration, but for values of pK a  less than about 2 or more than about 11, spectrophotometric or NMR measurements may be required due to practical difficulties with pH measurements.DefinitionsAccording to Arrhenius's original definition, an acid is a substance that dissociates in aqueous solution, releasing the hydrogen ion H +  (a proton):   Chapter 6: Acid–Base and Donor–Acceptor Chemistry HA   A −  + H + .The equilibrium constant for this dissociation reaction is known as a dissociation constant. The liberated proton combines with a water molecule to give a hydronium (or oxonium) ion H 3 O +  (naked protons do not exist in solution), and so Arrhenius later proposed that the dissociation should be written as an acid–base reaction:HA + H 2 O   A −  + H 3 O + .Brønsted and Lowry generalised this further to a proton exchange reaction:   Includes discussion of many organic Brønsted acids.    Chapter 5: Acids and Bases  acid + base   conjugate base + conjugate acid.The acid loses a proton, leaving a conjugate base; the proton is transferred to the base, creating a conjugate acid. For aqueous solutions of an acid HA, the base is water; the conjugate base is A −  and the conjugate acid is the hydronium ion. The Brønsted–Lowry definition applies to other solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide: the solvent S acts as a base, accepting a proton and forming the conjugate acid SH + .HA + S   A −  + SH + .In solution chemistry, it is common to use H +  as an abbreviation for the solvated hydrogen ion, regardless of the solvent. In aqueous solution H +  denotes a solvated hydronium ion rather than a proton. The designation of an acid or base as "conjugate" depends on the context. The conjugate acid BH +  of a base B dissociates according toBH +  + OH −    B + H 2 Owhich is the reverse of the equilibriumH 2 O (acid) + B (base)   OH −  (conjugate base) + BH +  (conjugate acid).The hydroxide ion OH − , a well known base, is here acting as the conjugate base of the acid water. Acids and bases are thus regarded simply as donors and acceptors of protons respectively.A broader definition of acid dissociation includes hydrolysis, in which protons are produced by the splitting of water molecules. For example, boric acid (B(OH) 3 ) produces H 3 O +  as if it were a proton donor,  but it has been confirmed by Raman spectroscopy that this is due to the hydrolysis equilibrium: B(OH) 3  + 2 H 2 O   B(OH) 4  −  + H 3 O + .Similarly, metal ion hydrolysis causes ions such as  [Al(H 2 O) 6 ] 3+   to behave as weak acids:   Section 9.1 "Acidity of Solvated Cations" lists many pK a  values. [Al(H 2 O) 6 ] 3+  + H 2 O   [Al(H 2 O) 5 (OH)] 2+  + H 3 O + .According to Lewis's original definition, an acid is a substance that accepts an electron pair to form a coordinate covalent bond.   p.698 Equilibrium constantAn acid dissociation constant is a particular example of an equilibrium constant. For the specific equilibrium between a monoprotic acid, HA and its conjugate base A − , in water,HA + H 2 O   A −  + H 3 O + the thermodynamic equilibrium constant,   can be defined by   Chapter 2: Activity and Concentration Quotients   K^\ominus = \mathrm{\frac{\{A^-\} \{H_3O^+\}} {\{HA\} \{H_2O\}}} where {A} is the activity of the chemical species A, etc.   is dimensionless since activity is dimensionless. Activities of the products of dissociation are placed in the numerator, activities of the reactants are placed in the denominator. See activity coefficient for a derivation of this expression.Since activity is the product of concentration and activity coefficient (γ) the definition could also be written as  K^\ominus = \mathrm{\frac{[A^-] [H_3O^+]}{[HA] [H_2O]}\times \frac{\gamma_{A^-} \ \gamma_{H_3O^+}}{\gamma_{HA} \ \gamma_{H_2O}} = \mathrm{\frac{[A^-] [H_3O^+]}{[HA] [H_2O]}} \times \Gamma} where [HA] represents the concentration of HA and Γ is a quotient of activity coefficients.To avoid the complications involved in using activities, dissociation constants are determined, where possible, in a medium of high ionic strength, that is, under conditions in which Γ can be assumed to be always constant.  For example, the medium might be a solution of 0.1 molar (M) sodium nitrate or 3 M potassium perchlorate. Furthermore, in all but the most concentrated solutions it can be assumed that the concentration of water, [H 2 O], is constant, approximately 55 M. On dividing   by the constant terms and writing [H + ] for the concentration of the hydronium ion the expression  K_\mathrm{a} = \mathrm{\frac{[A^-] [H^+]}{[HA]}} is obtained. This is the definition in common use.    pK a  is defined as −log 10 (K a ).Note, however, that all published dissociation constant values refer to the specific ionic medium used in their determination and that different values are obtained with different conditions, as shown for acetic acid in the illustration above. When published constants refer to an ionic strength other than the one required for a particular application, they may be adjusted by means of specific ion theory (SIT) and other theories.   Using the equation as shown K a  has dimensions of concentration, but the exact definition uses chemical activities, which can be dimensionless. Therefore, K a , as defined properly, is also dimensionless. But as defined here it is correct to quote a value with a dimension as, for example, "K a  = 300 M".Monoprotic acids After rearranging the expression defining K a , and putting  , one obtains   \mathrm{pH} = \mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a} + \log\left(\mathrm{\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}}\right) This is a form of the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, from which the following conclusions can be drawn. \mathrm{pH} - \mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a} = \log\left(\mathrm{\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}}\right) At half-neutralization  ; since  , the pH at half-neutralization is numerically equal to pK a . Conversely, when  , the concentration of HA is equal to the concentration of A − .The buffer region extends over the approximate range pK a  ± 2, though buffering is weak outside the range pK a  ± 1. At  ,  .If the pH is known, the ratio  may be calculated. This ratio is independent of the analytical concentration of the acid.In water, measurable pK a  values range from about −2 for a strong acid to about 12 for a very weak acid (or strong base). All acids with a pK a  value of less than −2 are more than 99% dissociated at pH 0 (1 M acid). This is known as solvent leveling since all such acids are brought to the same level of being strong acids, regardless of their pK a  values. Likewise, all bases with a pK a  value larger than the upper limit are more than 99% protonated at all attainable pH values and are classified as strong bases. An example of a strong acid is hydrochloric acid, HCl, which has a pK a  value, estimated from thermodynamic quantities, of −9.3 in water.   Chapter 5  The concentration of undissociated acid in a 1 M solution will be less than 0.01% of the concentrations of the products of dissociation. Hydrochloric acid is said to be fully dissociated in aqueous solution because the amount of undissociated acid is imperceptible. When the pK a  and analytical concentration of the acid are known, the extent of dissociation and pH of a solution of a monoprotic acid can be easily calculated using an ICE table.A buffer solution of a desired pH can be prepared as a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base. In practice the mixture can be created by dissolving the acid in water, and adding the requisite amount of strong acid or base. The pK a  of the acid must be less than two units different from the target pH.Polyprotic acidsPolyprotic acids are acids that can lose more than one proton. The constant for dissociation of the first proton may be denoted as K a1  and the constants for dissociation of successive protons as K a2 , etc. Phosphoric acid, H 3 PO 4 , is an example of a polyprotic acid as it can lose three protons.! Equilibrium! pK a  value |-| H 3 PO 4 + H + | pK a1  = 2.14|-|  + H + | pK a2  = 7.20|-|  + H + | pK a3  = 12.37|}When the difference between successive pK values is about four or more, as in this example, each species may be considered as an acid in its own right;    In fact salts of   may be crystallised from solution by adjustment of pH to about 5.5 and salts of   may be crystallised from solution by adjustment of pH to about 10. The species distribution diagram shows that the concentrations of the two ions are maximum at pH 5.5 and 10.When the difference between successive pK values is less than about four there is overlap between the pH range of existence of the species in equilibrium. The smaller the difference, the more the overlap. The case of citric acid is shown at the right; solutions of citric acid are buffered over the whole range of pH 2.5 to 7.5.According to Pauling's first rule, successive pK values of a given acid increase (pK a2  > pK a1 ).    For oxyacids with more than one ionizable hydrogen on the same atom, the pK a  values often increase by about 5 units for each proton removed,  as in the example of phosphoric acid above.In the case of a diprotic acid, H 2 A, the two equilibria areH 2 A   HA −  + H + HA −    A 2−  + H + it can be seen that the second proton is removed from a negatively charged species. Since the proton carries a positive charge extra work is needed to remove it; that is the cause of the trend noted above. Phosphoric acid values (above) illustrate this rule, as do the values for vanadic acid, H 3 VO 4 . When an exception to the rule is found it indicates that a major change in structure is occurring. In the case of VO 2  +  (aq), the vanadium is octahedral, 6-coordinate, whereas vanadic acid is tetrahedral, 4-coordinate. This is the basis for an explanation of why pK a1  > pK a2  for vanadium(V) oxoacids.! Equilibrium! pK a |-| [VO 2 (H 2 O) 4 ] +    H 3 VO 4  + H +  + 2H 2 O| pK a1  = 4.2|-| H 3 VO 4 + H + | pK a2  = 2.60|-|  + H + | pK a3  = 7.92|-|  + H + | pK a4  = 13.27|}Isoelectric point For substances in solution the isoelectric point (pI) is defined as the pH at which the sum, weighted by charge value, of concentrations of positively charged species is equal to the weighted sum of concentrations of negatively charged species. In the case that there is one species of each type, the isoelectric point can be obtained directly from the pK values. Take the example of glycine, defined as AH. There are two dissociation equilibria to consider.    AH + H + ;  [AH][H + ] = K 1 [ ]AH   A −  + H + ;  [A − ][H + ] = K 2 [AH]Substitute the expression for [AH] into the first equation[A − ][H + ] 2  = K 1 K 2 [ ]At the isoelectric point the concentration of the positively charged species, AH 2  + , is equal to the concentration of the negatively charged species, A − , so [H + ] 2  = K 1 K 2 Therefore, taking cologarithms, the pH is given by  \mathrm{p}I = \frac{\mathrm{p}K_1 + \mathrm{p}K_2}{2} pI values for amino acids are listed at Proteinogenic amino acid. When more than two charged species are in equilibrium with each other a full speciation calculation may be needed.Water self-ionization Water possesses both acidic and basic properties and is said to be amphiprotic. The ionization equilibrium can be writtenH 2 O   OH −  + H + where in aqueous solution H +  or H + (aq) denotes a solvated proton. Often this is written as the hydronium ion H 3 O + , but this formula is not exact because in fact there is solvation by more than one water molecule and species such as H 5 O 2  + , H 7 O 3  +  and H 9 O 4  +  are also present. The equilibrium constant is given by  K_\mathrm{a} = \mathrm{\frac{[H^+] [OH^-]}{[H_2O]}} When, as is usually the case, the concentration of water can be assumed to be constant, this expression may be replaced by  K_\mathrm{w} =[\mathrm{H}^+] [\mathrm{OH}^-]\, The self-ionization constant of water, K w , is thus just a special case of an acid dissociation constant. A logarithmic form analogous to pK a  may also be defined  \mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{w} = - \log_{10}\left(K_\mathrm{w}\right) pK w  values for pure water at various temperatures T (°C) 0  5 10 15  20 25 30 35 40  45 50   pK w  14.943 14.734  14.535  14.346 14.167 13.997 13.830 13.680 13.535  13.396  13.262  These data can be fitted to a parabola withpK w  = 14.94 − 0.04209T + 0.0001718T 2 From this equation, pK w  = 14 at 24.87 °C. At that temperature both hydrogen and hydroxide ions have a concentration of 10 −7  M.Protonation constantsThe dissociation of a monoprotic acid can also be described as the protonation of the conjugate base of the acid A −  + H +    AHThis leads to the definition of an association (protonation) constant, denoted here as K association , as K_\mathrm{association} = \mathrm{\frac{[HA]}{[A^-] [H^+]}} The dissociation (deprotonation) constant definition can be written as K_\mathrm{dissociation} = \mathrm{\frac{[A^-] [H^+]}{[HA]}} The definitions show that the values of the two constants are reciprocals of each other andpK dissociation  = log(K association )The situation is a little more complicated with polybasic acids. For example, with phosphoric acid pK a1  = log(K association,3 )pK a2  = log(K association,2 )pK a3  = log(K association,1 )Amphoteric substancesAn amphoteric substance is one that can act as an acid or as a base, depending on pH. Water (above) is amphoteric. Another example of an amphoteric molecule is the bicarbonate ion   that is the conjugate base of the carbonic acid molecule H 2 CO 3  in the equilibriumH 2 CO 3  + H 2 O+ H 3 O + but also the conjugate acid of the carbonate ion   in (the reverse of) the equilibrium  + OH − + H 2 O.Carbonic acid equilibria are important for acid–base homeostasis in the human body.An amino acid is also amphoteric with the added complication that the neutral molecule is subject to an internal acid–base equilibrium in which the basic amino group attracts and binds the proton from the acidic carboxyl group, forming a zwitterion.NH 2 CHRCO 2 H    At pH less than about 5 both the carboxylate group and the amino group are protonated. As pH increases the acid dissociates according to + H + At high pH a second dissociation may take place. + H + Thus the zwitterion,  , is amphoteric because it may either be protonated or deprotonated.Bases and basicityThe equilibrium constant K b  for a base is usually defined as the association constant for protonation of the base, B, to form the conjugate acid, HB + .B + H 2 O   HB +  + OH − Using similar reasoning to that used before  K_\mathrm{b} = \mathrm{\frac{[HB^+] [OH^-]}{[B]}}  \ \mathrm{p}K_{\mathrm b} = - \log_{10}\left(K_\mathrm{b}\right) K b  is related to K a  for the conjugate acid. In water, the concentration of the hydroxide ion, [OH − ], is related to the concentration of the hydrogen ion by K w  = [H + ][OH − ], therefore  \mathrm{[OH^-]} = \frac{K_{\mathrm w}}{\mathrm{[H^+]}} Substitution of the expression for [OH − ] into the expression for K b  gives  K_\mathrm{b} = \frac{[\mathrm{HB^+}]K_\mathrm{w}}{\mathrm{[B] [H^+]}} = \frac{K_\mathrm{w}}{K_\mathrm{a}} When K a , K b  and K w  are determined under the same conditions of temperature and ionic strength, it follows, taking cologarithms, that pK b  = pK w  − pK a . In aqueous solutions at 25 °C, pK w  is 13.9965,   Section D–152  so pK_\mathrm{b} \approx 14 - pK_\mathrm{a}  with sufficient accuracy for most practical purposes. In effect there is no need to define pK b  separately from pK a , but it is done here as often only pK b  values can be found in the older literature.For metal hydroxides K b  can also be defined as the dissociation constant for loss of a hydroxide ion:   or  .  This is the reciprocal of a stability constant for formation of the complex.Temperature dependenceAll equilibrium constants vary with temperature according to the van 't Hoff equation   Section 7.4: The Response of Equilibria to Temperature   \frac{\operatorname{d} \ln\left(K\right)}{\operatorname{d}T} = \frac{\Delta H^\ominus} {RT^2} R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature . Thus, for exothermic reactions, (the standard enthalpy change,  , is negative) K decreases with temperature, but for endothermic reactions (  is positive) K increases with temperature.The standard enthalpy change for a reaction is itself a function of temperature, according to Kirchhoff's law of thermochemistry: \left(\frac{\partial\Delta H}{\partial T}\right)_p = \Delta C_p where ΔC p  is the heat capacity change at constant pressure. In practice   may be taken to be constant over a small temperature range.Acidity in nonaqueous solutionsA solvent will be more likely to promote ionization of a dissolved acidic molecule in the following circumstances:   It is a protic solvent, capable of forming hydrogen bonds.It has a high donor number, making it a strong Lewis base.It has a high dielectric constant (relative permittivity), making it a good solvent for ionic species.pK a  values of organic compounds are often obtained using the aprotic solvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)  and acetonitrile (ACN).   Chapter 8: Acids and Bases Solvent properties at 25 °CSolvent  Donor number   Dielectric constant  Acetonitrile  14  37 Dimethylsulfoxide  30  47 Water  18  78 DMSO is widely used as an alternative to water because it has a lower dielectric constant than water, and is less polar and so dissolves non-polar, hydrophobic substances more easily. It has a measurable pK a  range of about 1 to 30. Acetonitrile is less basic than DMSO, and, so, in general, acids are weaker and bases are stronger in this solvent. Some pK a  values at 25 °C for acetonitrile (ACN)and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)    are shown in the following tables. Values for water are included for comparison.pK a  values of acidsHA   A −  + H +   ACN  DMSO  Water p-Toluenesulfonic acid 8.5 0.9 strong 2,4-Dinitrophenol 16.66 5.1 3.9 Benzoic acid 21.51 11.1 4.2 Acetic acid 23.51  12.6 4.756 Phenol  29.14  18.0 9.99   BH +    B + H +   ACN  DMSO  Water Pyrrolidine 19.56 10.8 11.4 Triethylamine 18.82 9.0 10.72 Proton sponge  18.62 7.5 12.1 Pyridine 12.53 3.4 5.2 Aniline 10.62 3.6 4.6 Ionization of acids is less in an acidic solvent than in water. For example, hydrogen chloride is a weak acid when dissolved in acetic acid. This is because acetic acid is a much weaker base than water.HCl + CH 3 CO 2 H   Cl −  +  acid + base   conjugate base + conjugate acidCompare this reaction with what happens when acetic acid is dissolved in the more acidic solvent pure sulfuric acid H 2 SO 4  + CH 3 CO 2 H+  The unlikely geminal diol species   is stable in these environments. For aqueous solutions the pH scale is the most convenient acidity function.    Other acidity functions have been proposed for non-aqueous media, the most notable being the Hammett acidity function, H 0 , for superacid media and its modified version H −  for superbasic media.   In aprotic solvents, oligomers, such as the well-known acetic acid dimer, may be formed by hydrogen bonding. An acid may also form hydrogen bonds to its conjugate base. This process, known as homoconjugation, has the effect of enhancing the acidity of acids, lowering their effective pK a  values, by stabilizing the conjugate base. Homoconjugation enhances the proton-donating power of toluenesulfonic acid in acetonitrile solution by a factor of nearly 800.    In aqueous solutions, homoconjugation does not occur, because water forms stronger hydrogen bonds to the conjugate base than does the acid.Mixed solventsWhen a compound has limited solubility in water it is common practice (in the pharmaceutical industry, for example) to determine pK a  values in a solvent mixture such as water/dioxane or water/methanol, in which the compound is more soluble.    In the example shown at the right, the pK a  value rises steeply with increasing percentage of dioxane as the dielectric constant of the mixture is decreasing.A pK a  value obtained in a mixed solvent cannot be used directly for aqueous solutions. The reason for this is that when the solvent is in its standard state its activity is defined as one. For example, the standard state of water:dioxane 9:1 is precisely that solvent mixture, with no added solutes. To obtain the pK a  value for use with aqueous solutions it has to be extrapolated to zero co-solvent concentration from values obtained from various co-solvent mixtures.These facts are obscured by the omission of the solvent from the expression that is normally used to define pK a , but pK a  values obtained in a given mixed solvent can be compared to each other, giving relative acid strengths. The same is true of pK a  values obtained in a particular non-aqueous solvent such a DMSO.As of 2008, a universal, solvent-independent, scale for acid dissociation constants has not been developed, since there is no known way to compare the standard states of two different solvents.Factors that affect pK a  valuesPauling's second rule is that the value of the first pK a  for acids of the formula XO m (OH) n  depends primarily on the number of oxo groups m, and is approximately independent of the number of hydroxy groups n, and also of the central atom X. Approximate values of pK a  are 8 for m = 0, 2 for m = 1, −3 for m = 2 and   Alternatively, various numerical formulas have been proposed including pK a  = 8 − 5m (known as Bell's rule),pK a  = 7 − 5m,   Douglas B., McDaniel D.H. and Alexander J.J. Concepts and Models of Inorganic Chemistry (2nd ed. Wiley 1983) p.526    or pK a  = 9 − 7m.  The dependence on m correlates with the oxidation state of the central atom, X: the higher the oxidation state the stronger the oxyacid. For example, pK a  for HClO is 7.2, for HClO 2  is 2.0, for HClO 3  is −1 and HClO 4  is a strong acid ( ).  The increased acidity on adding an oxo group is due to stabilization of the conjugate base by delocalization of its negative charge over an additional oxygen atom.  This rule can help assign molecular structure: for example phosphorous acid (H 3 PO 3 ) has a pK a  near 2 suggested that the structure is HPO(OH) 2 , as later confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, and not P(OH) 3  which would be expected to have a pK a  near 8. With organic acids inductive effects and mesomeric effects affect the pK a  values. A simple example is provided by the effect of replacing the hydrogen atoms in acetic acid by the more electronegative chlorine atom. The electron-withdrawing effect of the substituent makes ionisation easier, so successive pK a  values decrease in the series 4.7, 2.8, 1.4, and 0.7 when 0, 1, 2, or 3 chlorine atoms are present.    The Hammett equation, provides a general expression for the effect of substituents.   Section 13-3: Quantitative Correlations of Substituent Effects (Part B) – The Hammett Equation log(K a ) = log(K ) + ρσ.K a  is the dissociation constant of a substituted compound, K  is the dissociation constant when the substituent is hydrogen, ρ is a property of the unsubstituted compound and σ has a particular value for each substituent. A plot of log(K a ) against σ is a straight line with intercept log(K ) and slope ρ. This is an example of a linear free energy relationship as log(K a ) is proportional to the standard fee energy change. Hammett originally    formulated the relationship with data from benzoic acid with different substiuents in the ortho- and para- positions: some numerical values are in Hammett equation. This and other studies allowed substituents to be ordered according to their electron-withdrawing or electron-releasing power, and to distinguish between inductive and mesomeric effects. Alcohols do not normally behave as acids in water, but the presence of a double bond adjacent to the OH group can substantially decrease the pK a  by the mechanism of keto–enol tautomerism. Ascorbic acid is an example of this effect. The diketone 2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone) is also a weak acid because of the keto–enol equilibrium. In aromatic compounds, such as phenol, which have an OH substituent, conjugation with the aromatic ring as a whole greatly increases the stability of the deprotonated form.Structural effects can also be important. The difference between fumaric acid and maleic acid is a classic example. Fumaric acid is (E)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid, a trans isomer, whereas maleic acid is the corresponding cis isomer, i.e. (Z)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid (see cis-trans isomerism). Fumaric acid has pK a  values of approximately 3.0 and 4.5. By contrast, maleic acid has pK a  values of approximately 1.5 and 6.5. The reason for this large difference is that when one proton is removed from the cis isomer (maleic acid) a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond is formed with the nearby remaining carboxyl group. This favors the formation of the maleate H + , and it opposes the removal of the second proton from that species. In the trans isomer, the two carboxyl groups are always far apart, so hydrogen bonding is not observed. Proton sponge, 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene, has a pK a  value of 12.1. It is one of the strongest amine bases known. The high basicity is attributed to the relief of strain upon protonation and strong internal hydrogen bonding. Effects of the solvent and solvation should be mentioned also in this section. It turns out, these influences are more subtle than that of a dielectric medium mentioned above. For example, the expected (by electronic effects of methyl substituents) and observed in gas phase order of basicity of methylamines, Me 3 N > Me 2 NH > MeNH 2  > NH 3 , is changed by water to  Me 2 NH > MeNH 2  > Me 3 N > NH 3 . Neutral methylamine molecules are hydrogen-bonded to water molecules mainly through one acceptor, N–HOH, interaction and only occasionally just one more donor bond, NH–OH 2 . Hence, methylamines are stabilized to about the same extent by hydration, regardless of the number of methyl groups. In stark contrast, corresponding methylammonium cations always utilize all the available protons for donor NH–OH 2  bonding. Relative stabilization of methylammonium ions thus decreases with the number of methyl groups explaining the order of water basicity of methylamines. ThermodynamicsAn equilibrium constant is related to the standard Gibbs energy change for the reaction, so for an acid dissociation constant \Delta G^\ominus = -RT \ln K_\mathrm{a} \approx 2.303 RT\ \mathrm{p}K_\mathrm{a} .R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. Note that   and  . At 25 °C, ΔG  in kJ·mol −1  ≈ 5.708 pK a  (1 kJ·mol −1  = 1000 joules per mole). Free energy is made up of an enthalpy term and an entropy term.  \Delta G^\ominus = \Delta H^\ominus - T \Delta S^\ominus The standard enthalpy change can be determined by calorimetry or by using the van 't Hoff equation, though the calorimetric method is preferable. When both the standard enthalpy change and acid dissociation constant have been determined, the standard entropy change is easily calculated from the equation above. In the following table, the entropy terms are calculated from the experimental values of pK a  and ΔH . The data were critically selected and refer to 25 °C and zero ionic strength, in water.

Second, some reactions are exothermic and some are endothermic, but, when ΔH  is negative TΔS  is the dominant factor, which determines that ΔG  is positive. Last, the entropy contribution is always unfavourable ( ) in these reactions. Ions in aqueous solution tend to orient the surrounding water molecules, which orders the solution and decreases the entropy. The contribution of an ion to the entropy is the partial molar entropy which is often negative, especially for small or highly charged ions.  The ionization of a neutral acid involves formation of two ions so that the entropy decreases ( ). On the second ionization of the same acid, there are now three ions and the anion has a charge, so the entropy again decreases.Note that the standard free energy change for the reaction is for the changes from the reactants in their standard states to the products in their standard states. The free energy change at equilibrium is zero since the chemical potentials of reactants and products are equal at equilibrium.Experimental determination The experimental determination of pK a  values is commonly performed by means of titrations, in a medium of high ionic strength and at constant temperature.   Chapter 4: Experimental Procedure for Potentiometric pH Measurement of Metal Complex Equilibria  A typical procedure would be as follows. A solution of the compound in the medium is acidified with a strong acid to the point where the compound is fully protonated. The solution is then titrated with a strong base until all the protons have been removed. At each point in the titration pH is measured using a glass electrode and a pH meter. The equilibrium constants are found by fitting calculated pH values to the observed values, using the method of least squares.   The total volume of added strong base should be small compared to the initial volume of titrand solution in order to keep the ionic strength nearly constant. This will ensure that pK a  remains invariant during the titration.A calculated titration curve for oxalic acid is shown at the right. Oxalic acid has pK a  values of 1.27 and 4.27. Therefore, the buffer regions will be centered at about pH 1.3 and pH 4.3. The buffer regions carry the information necessary to get the pK a  values as the concentrations of acid and conjugate base change along a buffer region.Between the two buffer regions there is an end-point, or equivalence point, at about pH 3. This end-point is not sharp and is typical of a diprotic acid whose buffer regions overlap by a small amount: pK a2  − pK a1  is about three in this example. (If the difference in pK values were about two or less, the end-point would not be noticeable.) The second end-point begins at about pH  6.3 and is sharp. This indicates that all the protons have been removed. When this is so, the solution is not buffered and the pH rises steeply on addition of a small amount of strong base. However, the pH does not continue to rise indefinitely. A new buffer region begins at about pH 11 (pK w  − 3), which is where self-ionization of water becomes important.It is very difficult to measure pH values of less than two in aqueous solution with a glass electrode, because the Nernst equation breaks down at such low pH values. To determine pK values of less than about 2 or more than about 11 spectrophotometric  or NMRmeasurements may be used instead of, or combined with, pH measurements.When the glass electrode cannot be employed, as with non-aqueous solutions, spectrophotometric methods are frequently used.  These may involve absorbance or fluorescence measurements. In both cases the measured quantity is assumed to be proportional to the sum of contributions from each photo-active species; with absorbance measurements the Beer-Lambert law is assumed to apply.Aqueous solutions with normal water cannot be used for  1 H NMR measurements but heavy water, D 2 O, must be used instead.  13 C NMR data, however, can be used with normal water and  1 H NMR spectra can be used with non-aqueous media. The quantities measured with NMR are time-averaged chemical shifts, as proton exchange is fast on the NMR time-scale. Other chemical shifts, such as those of  31 P can be measured.Micro-constantsA base such as spermine has a few different sites where protonation can occur. In this example the first proton can go on the terminal –NH 2  group, or either of the internal –NH– groups. The pK a  values for dissociation of spermine protonated at one or other of the sites are examples of micro-constants. They cannot be determined directly by means of pH, absorbance, fluorescence or NMR measurements. Nevertheless, the site of protonation is very important for biological function, so mathematical methods have been developed for the determination of micro-constants.   Applications and significanceA knowledge of pK a  values is important for the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry; for example, the pK a  values of proteins and amino acid side chains are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability of proteins.    Protein pK a  values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions at or near the physiological pH for the study of biochemical reactions;    the design of these solutions depends on a knowledge of the pK a  values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS, which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine, which is used in gel electrophoresis.  Buffering is an essential part of acid base physiology including acid–base homeostasis,    and is key to understanding disorders such as acid–base imbalance.The isoelectric point of a given molecule is a function of its pK values, so different molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called isoelectric focusing,    which is used for separation of proteins by 2-D gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Buffer solutions also play a key role in analytical chemistry. They are used whenever there is a need to fix the pH of a solution at a particular value. Compared with an aqueous solution, the pH of a buffer solution is relatively insensitive to the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base. The buffer capacity    of a simple buffer solution is largest when pH = pK a . In acid–base extraction, the efficiency of extraction of a compound into an organic phase, such as an ether, can be optimised by adjusting the pH of the aqueous phase using an appropriate buffer. At the optimum pH, the concentration of the electrically neutral species is maximised; such a species is more soluble in organic solvents having a low dielectric constant than it is in water. This technique is used for the purification of weak acids and bases.   A pH indicator is a weak acid or weak base that changes colour in the transition pH range, which is approximately pK a  ± 1. The design of a universal indicator requires a mixture of indicators whose adjacent pK a  values differ by about two, so that their transition pH ranges just overlap.In pharmacology, ionization of a compound alters its physical behaviour and macro properties such as solubility and lipophilicity, log p). For example, ionization of any compound will increase the solubility in water, but decrease the lipophilicity. This is exploited in drug development to increase the concentration of a compound in the blood by adjusting the pK a  of an ionizable group.   Knowledge of pK a  values is important for the understanding of coordination complexes, which are formed by the interaction of a metal ion, M m+ , acting as a Lewis acid, with a ligand, L, acting as a Lewis base. However, the ligand may also undergo protonation reactions, so the formation of a complex in aqueous solution could be represented symbolically by the reaction[M(H 2 O) n ] m+  + LH   [M(H 2 O) n−1 L] (m−1)+  + H 3 O + To determine the equilibrium constant for this reaction, in which the ligand loses a proton, the pK a  of the protonated ligand must be known. In practice, the ligand may be polyprotic; for example EDTA 4−  can accept four protons; in that case, all pK a  values must be known. In addition, the metal ion is subject to hydrolysis, that is, it behaves as a weak acid, so the pK values for the hydrolysis reactions must also be known.   Assessing the hazard associated with an acid or base may require a knowledge of pK a  values.    For example, hydrogen cyanide is a very toxic gas, because the cyanide ion inhibits the iron-containing enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. Hydrogen cyanide is a weak acid in aqueous solution with a pK a  of about 9. In strongly alkaline solutions, above pH 11, say, it follows that sodium cyanide is "fully dissociated" so the hazard due to the hydrogen cyanide gas is much reduced. An acidic solution, on the other hand, is very hazardous because all the cyanide is in its acid form. Ingestion of cyanide by mouth is potentially fatal, independently of pH, because of the reaction with cytochrome c oxidase.In environmental science acid–base equilibria are important for lakes   Chapter 9-6: Acid Rain and the Buffer Capacity of Lakes  and rivers;  for example, humic acids are important components of natural waters. Another example occurs in chemical oceanography:    in order to quantify the solubility of iron(III) in seawater at various salinities, the pK a  values for the formation of the iron(III) hydrolysis products Fe(OH) 2+ ,   and Fe(OH) 3  were determined, along with the solubility product of iron hydroxide.   Values for common substancesThere are multiple techniques to determine the pK a  of a chemical, leading to some discrepancies between different sources. Well measured values are typically within 0.1 units of each other. Data presented here were taken at 25 °C in water.

Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on it, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through digestion.  It could also constitute a chase, stalking, or attack of prey. 

Diastase<====>57560<====>DiastaseA diastase ( ; from Greek διαστασις, "separation") is any one of a group of enzymes which catalyses the breakdown of starch into maltose.  Alpha amylase degrades starch to a mixture of the disaccharide maltose, the trisaccharide maltotriose, which contains three α (1-4)-linked glucose residues, and oligosaccharides known as dextrins that contain the α (1-6)-linked glucose branches.  Diastase was the first enzyme discovered.  See: It was extracted from malt solution in 1833 by Anselme Payen and Jean-François Persoz, chemists at a French sugar factory.  Payen & Persoz (1833), page 77.   Payen and Persoz found diastase in the seeds of barley, oats, and wheat, as well as in potatoes (Payen & Persoz (1833), page 76). 

Palm oil<====>57561<====>Palm oil Palm oil is an edible vegetable oil derived from the mesocarp (reddish pulp) of the fruit of the oil palms, primarily the African oil palm Elaeis guineensis,  and to a lesser extent from the American oil palm Elaeis oleifera and the maripa palm Attalea maripa. Palm oil is naturally reddish in color because of a high beta-carotene content.  It is not to be confused with palm kernel oil derived from the kernel of the same fruit.   or coconut oil derived from the kernel of the coconut palm (Cocos nucifera).  The differences are in color (raw palm kernel oil lacks carotenoids and is not red), and in saturated fat content: palm mesocarp oil is 49% saturated, while palm kernel oil and coconut oil are 81% and 86% saturated fats, respectively. 

Go (airline)<====>57562<====>Go (airline)    Go Fly (styled and trading as Go) was the name of a British low-cost airline, founded by British Airways (BA) in 1998.  It operated flights between London Stansted Airport and destinations in Europe.  The airline was purchased from BA in a management buy out backed by the private equity firm 3i in 2001.  In May 2002, it was bought by its rival EasyJet, and was merged into the airline's operations.   Its head office was in the Enterprise House in London Stansted Airport in Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex.  History Bob Ayling, CEO of British Airways, approached EasyJet founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, to ask whether he could visit claiming that he was fascinated by how the Greek entrepreneur had made the budget airline formula work. 

Anselme Payen<====>57564<====>Anselme Payen Anselme Payen ( ; 6 January 1795 – 13 May 1871) was a French chemist known for discovering the enzyme diastase, and the carbohydrate cellulose. BiographyPayen was born in Paris.  He began studying science with his father when he was 13-year-old, and later studied Chemistry at the École Polytechnique under the chemists Louis Nicolas Vauquelin and Michel Eugène Chevreul.  At the age of 23, Payen became manager of a borax-refining factory, where he developed a process for synthesizing borax from soda and boric acid.  Previously, all borax had been imported from the East Indies exclusively by the Dutch. 

Golden goal<====>57567<====>Golden goal  The golden goal or golden point is a rule used in association football, bandy, lacrosse, field hockey, ice hockey and korfball to decide the winner of a match (typically a knock-out match) in which scores are equal at the end of normal time.  It is a type of sudden death.  Under this rule, the game will end when a goal or point is scored; the team that scores that goal or point during extra time will be the winner.  Introduced formally in 1992, though with some history before that, the rule ceased to apply to most FIFA authorized football games in 2004. 

The Cure<====>57568<====>The Cure    The Cure   are an English rock band formed in Crawley, West Sussex in 1976.  The band has experienced several line-up changes, with vocalist, guitarist, and principal songwriter Robert Smith being the only constant member. Their debut single "Killing an Arab" (1978) and debut album Three Imaginary Boys (1979) were important records in the development of the post-punk and new wave movements that developed in the wake of the punk rock scene in the United Kingdom.  During the early 1980s, the band's increasingly dark and tormented music (as well as Smith's unique stage look) was a staple of the emerging style of music known as gothic rock.

Wild Helianthus annuus is a widely branched annual plant with many flower heads.  The domestic sunflower, however, often possesses only a single large inflorescence (flower head) atop an unbranched stem.  The name sunflower may derive from the flower's head's shape, which resembles the sun, or from the impression that the blooming plant appears to slowly turn its flower towards the sun as the latter moves across the sky on a daily basis.

Jacobson radical<====>57656<====>Jacobson radicalIn mathematics, more specifically ring theory, a branch of abstract algebra, the Jacobson radical of a ring R is the ideal consisting of those elements in R that annihilate all simple right R-modules.  It happens that substituting "left" in place of "right" in the definition yields the same ideal, and so the notion is left-right symmetric.  The Jacobson radical of a ring is frequently denoted by J(R) or rad(R); however to avoid confusion with other radicals of rings, the former notation will be preferred in this article.  The Jacobson radical is named after Nathan Jacobson, who was the first to study it for arbitrary rings in  .

Music history<====>57685<====>Music history Music history, sometimes called historical musicology, is the highly diverse subfield of the broader discipline of musicology that studies music from a historical viewpoint. In theory, "music history" could refer to the study of the history of any type or genre of music (e. g. , the history of Indian music or the history of rock).  In practice, these research topics are often categorized as part of ethnomusicology or cultural studies, whether or not they are ethnographically based.  The terms "music history" and "historical musicology" usually refer to the history of the notated music of Western elites, sometimes called "art music" (by analogy to art history, which tends to focus on elite art).

Hannibal occupied much of Italy for 15 years, but a Roman counter-invasion of North Africa forced him to return to Carthage, where he was decisively defeated by Scipio Africanus at the Battle of Zama.Conquests of HannibalHannibal's Crossing of the AlpsBattle of the TrebiaBattle of Lake TrasimeneBattle of CannaeBattle of Zama – marked the final and decisive end of the Second Punic War.  A Roman army led by Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus defeated a Carthaginian force led by the legendary commander Hannibal. Soon after this defeat on their home ground, the Carthaginian senate sued for peace, which was given to them by the Roman Republic on rather humiliating terms, ending the 17-year war.Third Punic War (149-146 BC) – involved an extended siege of Carthage, ending in the city's thorough destruction. The resurgence of the struggle can be explained by growing anti-Roman agitations in Hispania and Greece, and the visible improvement of Carthaginian wealth and martial power in the fifty years since the Second Punic War.Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)Crisis of the Roman Republic (134 BC-44 BC) – extended period of political instability and social unrest that culminated in the demise of the Roman Republic and the advent of the Roman Empire.Assassination of Julius CaesarRoman EmpirePrincipate (27 BC-284 AD) – first period of the Roman Empire, extending from the beginning of the reign of Caesar Augustus to the Crisis of the Third Century, after which it was replaced with the Dominate. During the Principate, the constitution of the Roman Republic was never formally abolished. It was amended in such a way as to maintain a politically correct façade of Republican government. This ended following the Crisis of the Third Century (235–284), during the reign of Diocletian.Julio-Claudian dynasty (27 BC-68 AD) – the first five Roman Emperors, including Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula (also known as Gaius), Claudius, and Nero. The dynasty ended when Nero committed suicide. AugustusTiberius (ruled 14-37 AD) – stepson of Augustus. He was one of Rome's greatest generals, conquering Pannonia, Dalmatia, Raetia, and temporarily Germania; laying the foundations for the northern frontier. But he came to be remembered as a dark, reclusive, and sombre ruler who never really desired to be emperor; Pliny the Elder called him tristissimus hominum, "the gloomiest of men." CaligulaClaudiusNeroYear of the Four Emperors (69 AD) – these four emperors were Galba, Otho, Vitellius, and Vespasian. Vespasian's rule marked the beginning of the Flavian dynasty.GalbaOthoVitelliusVespasianFlavian dynasty (69-96 AD)Nerva–Antonine dynasty (96-192 AD) – dynasty of seven Roman Emperors who ruled over the Roman Empire from 96 AD to 192 AD. These Emperors were Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius, Lucius Verus, and Commodus.NervaTrajanHadrianAntoninus PiusMarcus AureliusLucius VerusCommodusSeveran dynasty (193-235 AD)Crisis of the Third Century (235-284 AD) – period in which the Roman Empire nearly collapsed under the combined pressures of invasion, civil war, plague, and economic depression. The Crisis began with the assassination of Emperor Alexander Severus at the hands of his own troops, initiating a fifty-year period in which 20–25 claimants to the title of Emperor, mostly prominent Roman army generals, assumed imperial power over all or part of the Empire.Barracks emperor – any Roman Emperor who seized power by virtue of his command of the army. Barracks emperors were especially common in the period from 235 through 284, during the Crisis of the Third Century.List of barracks emperorsGallic Empire (260-274 AD) – modern name for a breakaway realm of the Roman Empire, founded by Postumus in 260 in the wake of barbarian invasions and instability in Rome, and at its height included the territories of Germania, Gaul, Britannia, and (briefly) Hispania.Palmyrene Empire (260-273) – splinter empire, that broke away from the Roman Empire during the Crisis of the Third Century. It encompassed the Roman provinces of Syria Palaestina, Egypt and large parts of Asia Minor.Dominate (284-476 AD) – 'despotic' latter phase of government in the ancient Roman Empire from the conclusion of the Third Century Crisis until the collapse of the Western Empire. The Emperor Diocletian abandoned the appearances of the Republic for the sake of control, and introduced a novel system of joint rule by four monarchs known as the Tetrarchy.Decline of the Roman Empire – process spanning many centuries; there is no consensus when it might have begun but many dates and time lines have been proposed by historians.Tetrarchy (293-313 AD) – Diocletian designated the general Maximian as co-emperor, first as Caesar (junior emperor) in 285, and then promoted him to Augustus in 286. Diocletian took care of matters in the Eastern regions of the Empire while Maximian similarly took charge of the Western regions. In 293, feeling more focus was needed on both civic and military problems, Diocletian, with Maximian's consent, expanded the imperial college by appointing two Caesars (one responsible to each Augustus).  The tetrarchy collapsed, however, in 313 and a few years later Constantine I reunited the two administrative divisions of the Empire as sole Augustus.  ;  . First Tetrarchy – created by Diocletian with Maximian's consent in 293 by the appointment of two subordinate Caesars.Diocletian (Augustus)Galerius  (Caesar)Maximian  (Augustus)Constantius Chlorus (Caesar)Second Tetrarchy – in 305, the senior emperors jointly abdicated and retired, elevating Constantius and Galerius to the rank of Augusti. They in turn appointed two new Caesars.Galerius  (Augustus)Maximinus (Caesar)Constantius Chlorus (Augustus)Flavius Valerius Severus (Caesar)Civil wars of the Tetrarchy – series of conflicts between the co-emperors of the Roman Empire, starting in 306 AD with the usurpation of Maxentius and the defeat of Severus, and ending with the defeat of Licinius at the hands of Constantine I in 324 AD.Constantinian dynasty –  informal name for the ruling family of the Roman Empire from Constantius Chlorus (†305) to the death of Julian in 363. It is named after its most famous member, Constantine the Great who became the sole ruler of the empire in 324. It is also called the Neo-Flavian dynasty.First phase of the Migration Period Division of the Roman Empire – in order to maintain control and improve administration, various schemes to divide the work of the Roman Emperor by sharing it between individuals were tried between 285 and 324, from 337 to 350, from 364 to 392, and again between 395 and 480. Although the administrative subdivisions varied, they generally involved a division of labour between East and West. Each division was a form of power-sharing (or even job-sharing), for the ultimate imperium was not divisible and therefore the empire remained legally one state—although the co-emperors often saw each other as rivals or enemies rather than partners.Western Roman Empire – In 285, Emperor Diocletian (r. 284–305) divided the Roman Empire's administration into western and eastern halves.  In 293, Rome lost its capital status, and Milan became the capital.Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire) –  term used by modern historians to distinguish the Constantinople-centered Roman Empire of the Middle Ages from its earlier classical existence.Nicomedia – Nicomedia was the metropolis of Bithynia under the Roman Empire, and Diocletian made it the eastern capital city of the Roman Empire in 286 when he introduced the Tetrarchy system.Constantinople – founded in AD 330, at ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the entire Roman Empire by Constantine the Great, after whom it was named.Walls of ConstantinopleFall of the Western Roman Empire (476 AD) – the two halves of the Roman Empire ended at different times, with the Western Roman Empire coming to an end in 476 AD (the end of Ancient Rome). The Eastern Roman Empire (referred to by historians as the Byzantine Empire) survived for nearly a thousand years more, and eventually engulfed much of the Western Roman Empire's former territory.Fall of the Western Roman Empire – this was not sudden, and took over a hundred years.  By 476, when Odoacer deposed the Emperor Romulus, the Western Roman Empire wielded negligible military, political, or financial power and had no effective control over the scattered Western domains that still described themselves as Roman.Odoacer – Germanic soldier, who in 476 became the first King of Italy (476-493). His reign is commonly seen as marking the end of the Western Roman Empire. Byzantine Empire (Byzantium) – after the Western Roman Empire fragmented and collapsed, the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium) continued to thrive, existing for nearly another thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. Its citizens referred to it as the Roman Empire, and saw it as a direct continuation of it. Historians consider it to be a distinctly different empire, with some overlap, but generally not included in the period referred to as Ancient Rome. Byzantium differed in major ways, including its primary language, which was Greek rather than Latin. It also differed religiously, with Roman mythology being replaced by Christianity.Legacy of the Roman Empire – what the Roman Empire passed on, in the form of cultural values, religious beliefs, as well as technological and other achievements, and through which it continued to shape other civilizations, a process which continues to this day.Cultural heritage of the Roman EmpireLast of the

Direct memory access<====>57717<====>Direct memory accessDirect memory access (DMA) is a feature of computer systems that allows certain hardware subsystems to access main system memory (Random-access memory), independent of the central processing unit (CPU). Without DMA, when the CPU is using programmed input/output, it is typically fully occupied for the entire duration of the read or write operation, and is thus unavailable to perform other work.  With DMA, the CPU first initiates the transfer, then it does other operations while the transfer is in progress, and it finally receives an interrupt from the DMA controller when the operation is done.  This feature is useful at any time that the CPU cannot keep up with the rate of data transfer, or when the CPU needs to perform work while waiting for a relatively slow I/O data transfer.

Middle English creole hypothesis<====>57764<====>Middle English creole hypothesis The Middle English creole hypothesis is the concept that the English language is a creole, i. e.  a language that developed from a pidgin.

The theory was first proposed in 1977 by C.  Bailey and K.  Maroldt and has since found both supporters and detractors in the academic world.  This judgement is found in both of these books:p.  19, A History of the English Language, Hogg & Denison, 2006p.

Some may have benevolent or good-spirited intentions, even if their actions are dangerous or questionable, which can make them accidental villains. 

Disarmament<====>57979<====>Disarmament Disarmament is the act of reducing, limiting, or abolishing weapons.  Disarmament generally refers to a country's military or specific type of weaponry.  Disarmament is often taken to mean total elimination of weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear arms.  General and Complete Disarmament was defined by the United Nations General Assembly as the elimination of all WMD, coupled with the “balanced reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments, based on the principle of undiminished security of the parties with a view to promoting or enhancing stability at a lower military level, taking into account the need of all States to protect their security. 

Shortwave radio<====>57980<====>Shortwave radio Shortwave radio is radio transmission using shortwave radio frequencies, generally  , just above the medium wave AM broadcast band. Radio waves in this band can be reflected or refracted from a layer of electrically charged atoms in the atmosphere called the ionosphere.   Therefore, short waves directed at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth at great distances, beyond the horizon.   This is called skywave or skip propagation.   Thus shortwave radio can be used for very long distance communication, in contrast to radio waves of higher frequency which travel in straight lines (line-of-sight propagation) and are limited by the visual horizon, about  . 

Datura stramonium<====>57983<====>Datura stramonium    Datura stramonium, known by the English names jimsonweed or  devil's snare, is a plant in the nightshade family.  It is believed to have originated in Mexico,  but has now become naturalized in many other regions.  Other common names for D.  stramonium include thornapple and moon flower,  and it has the Spanish name toloache.   Other names for the plant include hell's bells, devil's trumpet, devil's weed, tolguacha, Jamestown weed, stinkweed, locoweed, pricklyburr, devil's cucumber  and Thornapple.   Datura has been used in traditional medicine to relieve asthma symptoms and as an analgesic during surgery or bonesetting. 

Ian Fleming<====>57985<====>Ian Fleming    Ian Lancaster Fleming (28 May 1908 – 12 August 1964) was an English author, journalist and naval intelligence officer who is best known for his James Bond series of spy novels.  Fleming came from a wealthy family connected to the merchant bank Robert Fleming & Co. , and his father was the Member of Parliament for Henley from 1910 until his death on the Western Front in 1917.  Educated at Eton, Sandhurst and, briefly, the universities of Munich and Geneva, Fleming moved through several jobs before he started writing. While working for Britain's Naval Intelligence Division during the Second World War, Fleming was involved in planning Operation Goldeneye and in the planning and oversight of two intelligence units, 30 Assault Unit and T-Force. 

Gladius<====>57986<====>Gladius    Gladius ( ;   ,  ) was one Latin word for sword, and is used to represent the primary sword of Ancient Roman foot soldiers.  Early ancient Roman swords were similar to those of the Greeks.  From the 3rd century BC, the Romans adopted swords similar to those used by the Celtiberians and others during the early part of the conquest of Hispania.  This sword was known as the gladius hispaniensis, or "Hispanic sword".  A fully equipped Roman legionary after the reforms of Gaius Marius was armed with a shield (scutum), one or two javelins (pila), a sword (gladius), often a dagger (pugio), and, perhaps in the later empire period, darts (plumbatae). 

Rudolf Carnap<====>57987<====>Rudolf Carnap  Rudolf Carnap ( ;   ; May 18, 1891 – September 14, 1970) was a German-born philosopher who was active in Europe before 1935 and in the United States thereafter.  He was a major member of the Vienna Circle and an advocate of logical positivism.   He is considered "one of the giants among twentieth-century philosophers. " Life and workCarnap's father had risen from the status of a poor ribbon-weaver to become the owner of a ribbon-making factory.  His mother came from academic stock; her father was an educational reformer and her oldest brother was the archaeologist Wilhelm Dörpfeld. 

Falchion<====>57988<====>Falchion  A falchion ( ; Old French: fauchon; Latin: falx, "sickle") is a one-handed, single-edged sword of European origin, whose design is reminiscent of the Chinese dadao, and modern machete.  Falchions are found in different forms from around the 13th century up to and including the 16th century.  In some versions the falchion looks rather like the seax and later the sabre, and in other versions the form is irregular or like a machete with a crossguard. TypesThe blade designs of falchions varied widely across the continent and through the ages.  They almost always included a single edge with a slight curve on the blade towards the point on the end and most were also affixed with a quilloned crossguard for the hilt in the manner of the contemporary arming swords. 

PLUR<====>57989<====>PLURPeace Love Unity Respect, commonly shortened to PLUR, is a set of principles that is associated with the rave culture.  Originating from early online discussions about rave culture conducted on Usenet, it has been commonly used since the early 1990s when it became commonplace in club flyers and especially on club paraphernalia advertising underground outdoor trance parties.  It has since expanded to the larger rave dance music culture as well. It may be interpreted as the essential philosophy of life for ravers and clubbers, at least insomuch as it relates to interpersonal relationships, with basic directions on how people are expected to behave at a rave gathering. 

Monocoque<====>57992<====>MonocoqueMonocoque ( ), also structural skin, is a structural system where loads are supported through an object's external skin, similar to an egg shell.  The word monocoque is a French term for "single shell" or (of boats) "single hull".  A true monocoque carries both tensile and compressive forces within the skin and can be recognised by the absence of a load carrying internal frame. By contrast, a semi-monocoque is a hybrid combining a tensile stressed skin and a compressive structure made up of longerons and ribs or frames.   Other semi-monocoques, not to be confused with true monocoques, include vehicle unibodies, which tend to be composites, and inflatable shells or balloon tanks, both of which are pressure stabilised. 

Tragedy<====>57993<====>Tragedy    Tragedy (from the  , tragōidia )  is a form of drama based on human suffering that invokes an accompanying catharsis or pleasure in audiences.While many cultures have developed forms that provoke this paradoxical response, the term tragedy often refers to a specific tradition of drama that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of Western civilisation.That tradition has been multiple and discontinuous, yet the term has often been used to invoke a powerful effect of cultural identity and historical continuity—"the Greeks and the Elizabethans, in one cultural form; Hellenes and Christians, in a common activity," as Raymond Williams puts it. 

Epiphyte<====>57994<====>EpiphyteAn epiphyte is an organism that grows on the surface of a plant and derives its moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, water (in marine environments) or from debris accumulating around it.  Epiphytes take part in nutrient cycles and add to both the diversity and biomass of the ecosystem in which they occur like any other organism.  They are an important source of food for many species.  Typical, the older parts of a plant will have more epiphytes growing on them.  Epiphytes differ from parasites in that epiphytes grow on other plants for physical support and do not necessarily negatively affect the host. 

Corticosteroid<====>57996<====>Corticosteroid  Corticosteroids are a class of steroid hormones that are produced in the adrenal cortex of vertebrates, as well as the synthetic analogues of these hormones.  Two main classes of corticosteroids, glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, are involved in a wide range of physiologic processes, including stress response, immune response, and regulation of inflammation, carbohydrate metabolism, protein catabolism, blood electrolyte levels, and behavior.    Some common naturally occurring steroid hormones are cortisol ( ), corticosterone ( ), cortisone ( ) and aldosterone ( ).  (Note that aldosterone and cortisone share the same chemical formula but the structures are different. 

Adrenocorticotropic hormone<====>57997<====>Adrenocorticotropic hormone   Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH, also adrenocorticotropin, corticotropin) is a polypeptide tropic hormone produced and secreted by the anterior pituitary gland.It is also used as a medication and diagnostic agent. ACTH is an important component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and is often produced in response to biological stress (along with its precursor corticotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus).  Its principal effects are increased production and release of cortisol by the cortex of the adrenal gland.  ACTH is also related to the circadian rhythm in many organisms.  Deficiency of ACTH is a sign of secondary adrenal insufficiency (suppressed production of ACTH due to an impairment of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, cf. 

Battle of the Bulge<====>57998<====>Battle of the Bulge  The Battle of the Bulge (16 December 1944 – 25 January 1945) was the last major German offensive campaign on the Western Front during World War II.  It was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region of Wallonia in eastern Belgium, northeast France, and Luxembourg, towards the end of World War II.  The surprise attack caught the Allied forces completely off guard.  American forces bore the brunt of the attack and incurred their highest casualties of any operation during the war.  The battle also severely depleted Germany's armored forces, and they were largely unable to replace them. 

Gentiana<====>58003<====>Gentiana  Gentiana    is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the gentian family (Gentianaceae), the tribe Gentianeae, and the monophyletic subtribe Gentianinae.  With about 400 species it is considered a large genus.  They are notable for their mostly large, trumpet-shaped flowers, which are often of an intense blue.    The genus name is a tribute to Gentius, an Illyrian king who may have been the discoverer of tonic properties in gentians.  HabitatThis is a cosmopolitan genus, occurring in alpine habitats in temperate regions of Asia, Europe and the Americas.  Some species also occur in northwestern Africa, eastern Australia, and New Zealand. 

Gentiana acaulis<====>58004<====>Gentiana acaulis Gentiana acaulis, the stemless gentian,  is a species of flowering plant in the family Gentianaceae, native to central and southern Europe, from Spain east to the Balkans, growing especially in mountainous regions, such as the Alps, Cevennes and Pyrenees, at heights of  . It is a perennial plant, growing to 2 cm tall and 10 cm or more wide.  The leaves are evergreen, 2-3. 5 cm long, in a basal rosette, forming clumps.  The trumpet-shaped terminal flowers are blue with olive-green spotted longitudinal throats.  They grow on a very short peduncle, 3–6 cm long.  The flower stem is often without leaves, or has 1 or 2 pairs of leaves. 

Airship<====>58005<====>Airship   An airship or dirigible balloon is a type of aerostat or lighter-than-air aircraft that can navigate through the air under its own power.   Aerostats gain their lift from large gas bags filled with a lifting gas that is less dense than the surrounding air. In early dirigibles, the lifting gas used was hydrogen gas, due to its high lifting capacity and ready availability.  Helium gas has almost the same lifting capacity and is not flammable, unlike hydrogen, but is rare and relatively expensive.  Significant amounts were first discovered in the United States and for a while helium was only used for airships by the United States. 

Bachem Ba 349<====>58008<====>Bachem Ba 349The Bachem Ba 349 Natter (  ) was a World War II German point-defence rocket-powered interceptor, which was to be used in a very similar way to a manned surface-to-air missile.  After a vertical take-off, which eliminated the need for airfields, most of the flight to the Allied bombers was to be controlled by an autopilot.  The primary role of the relatively untrained pilot was to aim the aircraft at its target bomber and fire its armament of rockets.  The pilot and the fuselage containing the rocket-motor would then land using separate parachutes, while the nose section was disposable. 

Good Friday<====>58009<====>Good Friday    Good Friday is a Christian holiday   commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and his death at Calvary.  It is observed during Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum on the Friday preceding Easter Sunday, and may coincide with the Jewish observance of Passover.  It is also known as Holy Friday, Great Friday, Black Friday,    or Easter Friday,  though the last term properly refers to the Friday in Easter week. The date of Good Friday varies from one year to the next on both the Gregorian calendar.

Mohave people<====>58015<====>Mohave people   Mohave or Mojave (Mojave: 'Aha Makhav) are a Native American people indigenous to the Colorado River in the Mojave Desert.  The Fort Mojave Indian Reservation includes territory within the borders of California, Arizona, and Nevada.  The Colorado River Indian Reservation includes parts of California and Arizona and is shared by members of the Chemehuevi, Hopi, and Navajo peoples. The original Colorado River and Fort Mojave reservations were established in 1865 and 1870, respectively.  Both reservations include substantial senior water rights in the Colorado River; water is drawn for use in irrigated farming.  The four combined tribes sharing the Colorado River Indian Reservation function today as one geo-political unit known as the federally recognized Colorado River Indian Tribes; each tribe also continues to maintain and observe its individual traditions, distinct religions, and culturally unique identities. 

Microwave oven<====>58017<====>Microwave oven    A microwave oven (also commonly referred to as a microwave) is a kitchen appliance that heats and cooks food by exposing it to electromagnetic radiation in the microwave frequency range.  This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating.  Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer of a homogeneous, high water content  food item; food is more evenly heated throughout than generally occurs in other cooking techniques. The development of the cavity magnetron in the UK made possible the production of electromagnetic waves of a small enough wavelength (microwaves). 

Tora! Tora! Tora!<====>58018<====>Tora! Tora! Tora!  Tora! Tora! Tora! ( ) is a 1970 Japanese-American biographical war drama film that dramatizes the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.  The film was directed by Richard Fleischer , Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku and stars an ensemble cast, including Martin Balsam, Joseph Cotten, Sō Yamamura, E.  G.  Marshall, James Whitmore, and Jason Robards. The "tora" of the title is the two-syllable Japanese codeword used to indicate that complete surprise had been achieved: "to" is the initial syllable of "totsugeki (突撃)", meaning "assault", while "ra" stands for "raigeki (雷撃)" ("torpedo attack") . 

Harvard architecture<====>58019<====>Harvard architecture  The Harvard architecture is a computer architecture with physically separate storage and signal pathways for instructions and data.  The term originated from the Harvard Mark I relay-based computer, which stored instructions on punched tape (24 bits wide) and data in electro-mechanical counters.  These early machines had data storage entirely contained within the central processing unit, and provided no access to the instruction storage as data.  Programs needed to be loaded by an operator; the processor could not initialize itself. Today, most processors implement such separate signal pathways for performance reasons, but actually implement a modified Harvard architecture, so they can support tasks like loading a program from disk storage as data and then executing it. 

Lewis–Clark State College<====>58023<====>Lewis–Clark State College    Lewis–Clark State College is a public undergraduate college in the Northwestern United States, located in Lewiston, Idaho.  Founded   in 1893, it has an annual enrollment of approximately 3,500 students.  The college offers more than 83 degrees and is well known for its criminal justice, education, nursing, and technical programs. HistoryIn 1893, Idaho Governor William J.  McConnell signed an act on January 27 authorizing the establishment of the Lewiston State Normal School in Lewiston.   There was a catch, however: "Provided the mayor and common council of that city on or before May 1, 1893, donate ten acres, within the city limits and known as part of the city park, and authorizing the said mayor and council to convey to the trustees of said normal school the said tract of land," etc. 

Bourgeoisie<====>58031<====>Bourgeoisie The bourgeoisie ( ;  ) is a polysemous French term that can mean:originally and generally, "those who live in the borough", that is to say, the people of the city (including merchants and craftsmen), as opposed to those of rural areas; in this sense, the bourgeoisie began to grow in Europe from the 11th century and particularly during the Renaissance of the 12th century, with the first developments of rural exodus and urbanization. a legally defined class of the Middle Ages to the end of the Ancien Régime (Old Regime) in France, that of inhabitants having the rights of citizenship and political rights in a city (comparable to the German term Bürgertum and  ; see also "Burgher"). 

Control Data Corporation<====>58032<====>Control Data Corporation  Control Data Corporation (CDC) was a mainframe and supercomputer firm.  CDC was one of the nine major United States computer companies through most of the 1960s; the others were IBM, Burroughs Corporation, DEC, NCR, General Electric, Honeywell, RCA, and UNIVAC.  CDC was well-known and highly regarded throughout the industry at the time.  For most of the 1960s, Seymour Cray worked at CDC and developed a series of machines that were the fastest computers in the world by far, until Cray left the company to found Cray Research (CRI) in the 1970s.  After several years of losses in the early 1980s, in 1988 CDC started to leave the computer manufacturing business and sell the related parts of the company, a process that was completed in 1992 with the creation of Control Data Systems, Inc.

Chinese sovereign<====>58043<====>Chinese sovereign Chinese sovereign is the ruler of a particular period in ancient China.  Several titles and naming schemes have been used throughout history. Imperial titlesEmperor The characters Huang (皇 huáng "august (ruler)") and Di (帝 dì "divine ruler") had been used separately and never consecutively (see Three August Ones and Five Emperors).   The character was reserved for mythological rulers until the first emperor of Qin (Qin Shi Huang), who created a new title Huangdi (皇帝 in pinyin: huáng dì) for himself in 221 BCE, which is commonly translated as Emperor in English.   This title continued in use until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911. 

LL parser<====>58045<====>LL parserIn computer science, an LL parser is a top-down parser for a subset of context-free languages.  It parses the input from Left to right, performing Leftmost derivation of the sentence. An LL parser is called an LL(k) parser if it uses k tokens of lookahead when parsing a sentence.  If such a parser exists for a certain grammar and it can parse sentences of this grammar without backtracking then it is called an LL(k) grammar.  LL(k) grammars can generate more languages the higher the number k of lookahead tokens.   A corollary of this is that not all context-free languages can be recognized by an LL(k) parser. 

Figure-eight knot<====>58046<====>Figure-eight knot    The figure-eight knot or figure-of-eight knot is a type of stopper knot.  It is very important in both sailing and rock climbing as a method of stopping ropes from running out of retaining devices.  Like the overhand knot, which will jam under strain, often requiring the rope to be cut, the figure-of-eight will also jam, but is usually more easily undone than the overhand knot.  The stevedore knot is the figure-eight knot with two half twists added before the end is finally stuck. Different typesFigure-eight loopThe figure-eight loop is used like an overhand loop knot.

Handy was one of the most influential American songwriters.    He was one of many musicians who played the distinctively American blues music, and he is credited with giving it its contemporary form.    Handy did not create the blues genre and was not the first to publish music in the blues form, but he took the blues from a regional music style (Delta blues) with a limited audience to one of the dominant national forces in American music. 

House of Este<====>58070<====>House of Este  The House of Este ( ,  ; originally House of Welf-Este) is a European princely dynasty. The elder branch of the House of Este included the dukes of Brunswick and Lüneburg and produced Britain's Hanoverian monarchs, as well as one Emperor of Russia (Ivan VI).  The younger branch of the House of Este included rulers of Ferrara (1240–1597), and of Modena and Reggio (1288–1796). OriginsAccording to Edward Gibbon, the family originated from the Roman Attii family, which migrated from Rome to Este  to defend Italy against the Ostrogoths.  However, there is little evidence to support this hypothesis.

Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period<====>58079<====>Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period was an era of political upheaval in 10th-century Imperial China.  Five states quickly succeeded one another in the Central Plain, and more than a dozen concurrent states were established elsewhere, mainly in South China. Traditionally, the era started with the fall of the Tang dynasty in 907 AD and ended with the founding of the Song dynasty in 960.  Many states had been de facto independent kingdoms long before 907.  After the Tang had collapsed, the kings who controlled the Central plain crowned themselves as emperor. 

Vladimir Atlasov<====>58084<====>Vladimir Atlasov Vladimir Vasilyevich Atlasov or Otlasov (  or Отла́сов) (born in Veliky Ustyug between 1661 and 1664—died in 1711) was a Siberian Cossack who was the first Russian to organize systematic exploration of the Kamchatka Peninsula.  Atlasov Island, an uninhabited volcanic island off the southern tip of Kamchatka, is named after him. He is first heard of around 1682 collecting Yasak on the Aldan River and one of the Uda Rivers.  In 1695 the voyevoda of Yakutsk appointed him prikazshchik of Anadyrsk.  The Russians here had heard reports of a 'Kamchatka River' to the south and were already collecting yasak on the headwaters of the rivers that flow south toward Kamchatka.

The primary vertical motion is upward.  Dust devils are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to pose a threat to both people and property.    They are comparable to tornadoes in that both are a weather phenomenon involving a vertically oriented rotating column of wind.  Most tornadoes are associated with a larger parent circulation, the mesocyclone on the back of a supercell thunderstorm. 

Alliance<====>58162<====>Alliance   An alliance is a relationship among people, groups, or states that have joined together for mutual benefit or to achieve some common purpose, whether or not explicit agreement has been worked out among them.Members of an alliance are called allies.  Alliances form in many settings, including political alliances, military alliances, and business alliances.  When the term is used in the context of war or armed struggle, such associations may also be called allied powers, especially when discussing World War I or World War II. A formal military alliance is not required for being perceived as an ally—co-belligerence, fighting alongside someone, is enough. 

Lonely Mountain<====>58163<====>Lonely Mountain  In J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, the Lonely Mountain (Sindarin Erebor) is a mountain in the north of Rhovanion.  It is the source of the Celduin River, and the location of the Kingdom under the Mountain.  The town of Dale lies in a vale on its southern slopes. Internal historyNatural historyErebor stood hundreds of miles from the nearest mountain range.

Pride parade<====>58168<====>Pride parade   Pride parades (also known as pride marches, pride events, and pride festivals) are events celebrating lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) culture and pride.  The events also at times serve as demonstrations for legal rights such as same-sex marriage.  Most pride events occur annually, and many take place around June to commemorate the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, a pivotal moment in modern LGBT social movements.  History Early on the morning of Saturday June 28, 1969, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons rioted following a police raid on the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City.

Freckle<====>58180<====>Freckle    Freckles are clusters of concentrated melaninized cells which are most easily visible on people with a fair complexion.  Freckles do not have an increased number of the melanin-producing cells, or melanocytes, but instead have melanocytes that overproduce melanin granules (melanosomes) changing the coloration of the outer skin cells (keratinocytes).  As such, freckles are different from lentigines and moles.  Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease Elsevier.  2005.  p.  1232.   .  BiologyThe formation of freckles is triggered by exposure to sunlight.  The exposure to UV-B radiation activates melanocytes to increase melanin production, which can cause freckles to become darker and more visible.

Pierre Corneille<====>58193<====>Pierre Corneille  Pierre Corneille ( ; Rouen, 6 June 1606 – Paris, 1 October 1684) was a French tragedian.  He is generally considered one of the three great seventeenth-century French dramatists, along with Molière and Racine. As a young man, he earned the valuable patronage of Cardinal Richelieu, who was trying to promote classical tragedy along formal lines, but later quarrelled with him, especially over his best-known play, Le Cid, about a medieval Spanish warrior, which was denounced by the newly formed Académie française for breaching the unities.  He continued to write well-received tragedies for nearly forty years. 

Mikhail Bakunin<====>58198<====>Mikhail Bakunin   Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin  ( ;    – 1 July 1876) was a Russian revolutionary anarchist and founder of collectivist anarchism.  He is considered among the most influential figures of anarchism, and one of the principal founders of the social anarchist tradition.   Bakunin's enormous prestige as an activist made him one of the most famous ideologues in Europe, and he gained substantial influence among radicals throughout Russia and Europe. Bakunin grew up in Pryamukhino, a family estate in Tver Governorate, where he moved to study philosophy and began to read the French encyclopédistes, leading to enthusiasm for the philosophy of Fichte.

Balaam<====>58202<====>Balaam  Balaam /ˈbeɪlæm/  ( ,  Standard  Bilʻam  Tiberian  Bileʻām) is a diviner in the Torah, his story occurring towards the end of the Book of Numbers ( ).  The etymology of his name is uncertain, and discussed below.  Every ancient reference to Balaam considers him a non-Israelite, a prophet, and the son of Beor, though Beor is not clearly identified.  Though some sources may only describe the positive blessings he delivers upon the Israelites, he is reviled as a "  man"  in both Torah and its commentaries, as well as in the New Testament. 

Franz Xaver von Baader<====>58203<====>Franz Xaver von BaaderFranz von Baader (27 March 1765 – 23 May 1841), born Benedikt Franz Xaver Baader, was a German Catholic philosopher, theologian, and mining engineer.  Resisting the empiricism of his day, he denounced most Western philosophy since Descartes as trending towards atheism and has been considered a revival of the Scholastic school.  He was one of the most influential theologians of his age but his influence on subsequent philosophy has been less marked. LifeBenedikt Franz Xaver Baader  was born in Munich, Bavaria, on 27 March 1765.   He was the third son of Joseph Franz von Paula Baader  (15 September 1733 - 16 February 1794) and Maria Dorothea Rosalia von Schöpf (25 October 1742 - 5 February 1829),    who were married on 23 May 1761. 

Baal<====>58204<====>Baal   Baal ( ), Oxford English Dictionary (1885), "Baal, n. "   properly Baʿal,  was a title and honorific meaning "lord" in the Northwest Semitic languages spoken in the Levant during antiquity.  From its use among people, it came to be applied to gods.   Scholars previously associated the theonym with solar cults and with a variety of unrelated patron deities, but inscriptions have shown that the name Baʿal was particularly associated with the storm and fertility god Hadad and his local manifestations.  The Hebrew Bible, compiled and curated over a span of centuries, includes early use of the term in reference to God (known to them as Yahweh), generic use in reference to various Levantine deities, and finally pointed application towards Hadad, who was decried as a false god. 

Vector processor<====>58205<====>Vector processor In computing, a vector processor or array processor is a central processing unit (CPU) that implements an instruction set containing instructions that operate on one-dimensional arrays of data called vectors, compared to scalar processors, whose instructions operate on single data items.  Vector processors can greatly improve performance on certain workloads, notably numerical simulation and similar tasks.  Vector machines appeared in the early 1970s and dominated supercomputer design through the 1970s into the 1990s, notably the various Cray platforms.  The rapid fall in the price-to-performance ratio of conventional microprocessor designs led to the vector supercomputer's demise in the later 1990s.

François-Noël Babeuf<====>58213<====>François-Noël Babeuf  François-Noël Babeuf ( ; 23 November 1760 – 27 May 1797), known as Gracchus Babeuf,  was a French political agitator and journalist of the French Revolutionary period.  His newspaper Le tribun du peuple ("the tribune of the people") was  best known for his advocacy for the poor and calling for a popular revolt against the Directory, the government of France.   He was a leading advocate for democracy, the abolition of private property and the equality of results.  He angered the authorities who were clamping down hard on their radical enemies.  In spite of the efforts of his Jacobin friends to save him, Babeuf was executed for his role in the Conspiracy of the Equals. 

Churchill Babington<====>58215<====>Churchill BabingtonChurchill Babington ( ; 11 March 1821 12 January 1889) was an English classical scholar, archaeologist and naturalist. LifeBorn at Rothley Temple, in Leicestershire, he was first educated by his father, Matthew Drake Babington, and then studied under Charles Wycliffe Goodwin, the orientalist and archaeologist.  He entered St John's College, Cambridge in 1839 and graduated in 1843, seventh in the first class of the classical tripos and a senior optime.   In 1845 he obtained the Hulsean Prize for his essay The Influence of Christianity in promoting the Abolition of Slavery in Europe.  In 1846 he was elected to a fellowship and took orders. 

Accountant<====>58216<====>Accountant   An accountant is a practitioner of accounting or accountancy, which is the measurement, disclosure or provision of assurance about financial information that helps managers, investors, tax authorities and others make decisions about allocating resource(s). In many jurisdictions, professional accounting bodies maintain standards of practice and evaluations for professionals.  Accountants who have demonstrated competency through their professional associations' certification exams are certified to use titles such as Chartered Accountant, Chartered Certified Accountant or Certified Public Accountant.  Such professionals are granted certain responsibilities by statute, such as the ability to certify an organization's financial statements, and may be held liable for professional misconduct. 

Baby farming<====>58219<====>Baby farming  Baby farming refers to the historical practice of accepting custody of an infant or child in exchange for payment in late-Victorian Era Britain and, less commonly, in Australia and the United States.   If the infant was young, this usually included wet-nursing (breast-feeding by a woman not the mother).  Some baby farmers "adopted" children for lump-sum payments, while others cared for infants for periodic payments. DescriptionThough baby farmers were paid in the understanding that care would be provided, the term "baby farmer" was used as an insult, and improper treatment was usually implied.   Illegitimacy and its attendant social stigma were usually the impetus for a mother's decision to put her children "out to nurse" with a baby farmer, but baby farming also encompassed foster care and adoption in the period before they were regulated by British law. 

United States Secret Service<====>58221<====>United States Secret Service  The United States Secret Service ("USSS" or "Secret Service") is a premier federal law enforcement agency under the U. S.  Department of Homeland Security.Until 2003, the Service was part of the U. S.  Department of the Treasury, as the agency was originally founded to combat the then-widespread counterfeiting of U.

Babylonian captivity<====>58224<====>Babylonian captivity  The Babylonian captivity or Babylonian exile is the period in Jewish history during which a number of people from the ancient Kingdom of Judah were captives in Babylonia.  After the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, besieged Jerusalem, resulting in tribute being paid by King Jehoiakim.   Jehoiakim refused to pay tribute in Nebuchadnezzar's fourth year, which led to another siege in Nebuchadnezzar's seventh year, culminating with the death of Jehoiakim and the exile of King Jeconiah, his court and many others; Jeconiah's successor Zedekiah and others were exiled in Nebuchadnezzar's eighteenth year; a later deportation occurred in Nebuchadnezzar's twenty-third year. 

Babylonian law<====>58225<====>Babylonian law  Babylonian law is a subset of cuneiform law that has received particular study, owing to the singular extent of the associated archaeological material that has been found for it.  So-called "contracts" exist in the thousands, including a great variety of deeds, conveyances, bonds, receipts, accounts, and most important of all, actual legal decisions given by the judges in the law courts.  Historical inscriptions, royal charters and rescripts, dispatches, private letters and the general literature afford welcome supplementary information.  Even grammatical and lexicographical texts contain many extracts or short sentences bearing on law and custom. 

Arcadia<====>58227<====>Arcadia {{Infobox settlement }}Arcadia ( , Arkadía) is one of the regional units of Greece.  It is part of the administrative region of Peloponnese.  It is situated in the central and eastern part of the Peloponnese peninsula.  It takes its name from the mythological figure Arcas.  In Greek mythology, it was the home of the god Pan.  In European Renaissance arts, Arcadia was celebrated as an unspoiled, harmonious wilderness. GeographyArcadia has its present-day capital at Tripoli.  It covers about 18% of the Peloponnese peninsula, making it the largest regional unit on the peninsula.  Arcadia has a ski resort on Mount Mainalo, located about 20 km NW of Tripoli. 

Bacchanalia<====>58229<====>Bacchanalia The Bacchanalia were Roman festivals of Bacchus, based on various ecstatic elements of the Greek Dionysia.  They seem to have been popular, and well-organised, throughout the central and southern Italian peninsula.  They were almost certainly associated with Rome's native cult of Liber, and probably arrived in Rome itself around 200 BC but like all mystery religions of the ancient world, very little is known of their rites. Livy, writing some 200 years after the event, offers a scandalised, extremely colourful account of the Bacchanalia.  Modern scholarship takes a skeptical approach to his allegations of frenzied rites, sexually violent initiations of both sexes, all ages and all social classes, and the cult as a murderous instrument of conspiracy against the state. 

Solon<====>58230<====>Solon  Solon (  Sólōn,  ;   BC) was an Athenian statesman, lawmaker and poet.  He is remembered particularly for his efforts to legislate against political, economic and moral decline in archaic Athens.  Aristotle Politics 1273b 35–1274a 21  His reforms failed in the short term, yet he is often credited with having laid the foundations for Athenian democracy.    E.  Harris, A New Solution to the Riddle of the Seisachtheia, in 'The Development of the Polis in Archaic Greece', eds.  L.  Mitchell and P.  Rhodes (Routledge 1997) 103  He wrote poetry for pleasure, as patriotic propaganda and in defence of his constitutional reforms. 

Bacchylides<====>58231<====>BacchylidesBacchylides ( ;  ,  Bakkhylídēs;   century  ) was a Greek lyric poet.  Later Greeks included him in the canonical list of nine lyric poets which included his uncle Simonides.  The elegance and polished style of his lyrics have been noted in Bacchylidean scholarship since at least Longinus.    Some scholars, however, have characterized these qualities as superficial charm.  Burnettn 1985, p.  3  He has often been compared unfavourably with his contemporary, Pindar, as "a kind of Boccherini to Pindar's Haydn".  Slavitt (1998), p.  1  However, the differences in their styles do not allow for easy comparison, and translator Robert Fagles has written that "to blame Bacchylides for not being Pindar is as childish a judgement as to condemn . 

List of federal agencies in the United States<====>58232<====>List of federal agencies in the United States This is a list of agencies of the United States federal government. Legislative definitions of a federal agency are varied, and even contradictory, and the official United States Government Manual offers no definition.    While the Administrative Procedure Act definition of "agency" applies to most executive branch agencies, Congress may define an agency however it chooses in enabling legislation, and subsequent litigation, often involving the Freedom of Information Act and the Government in the Sunshine Act.  These further cloud attempts to enumerate a list of agencies.   The executive branch of the federal government includes the Executive Office of the President and the United States federal executive departments (whose secretaries belong to the Cabinet). 

Baccio D'Agnolo<====>58234<====>Baccio D'Agnolo Baccio D'Agnolo (19 May 1462 6 March 1543 ), born Bartolomeo Baglioni, was an Italian woodcarver, sculptor and architect from Florence. Biography"Baccio" is an abbreviation of Bartolomeo, and "d'Agnolo" refers to Angelo, his father's name.  He started as a wood-carver, and between 1491 and 1502 did much of the decorative carving in the church of Santa Maria Novella and the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence.  Having made his reputation as a sculptor he appears to have turned his attention to architecture, and to have studied at Rome, though the precise date is uncertain; but at the beginning of the sixteenth century he was engaged with  the architect Simone del Pollaiolo in restoring the Palazzo Vecchio, and in 1506 he was commissioned to complete the drum of the cupola of the church of Santa Maria del Fiore. 

United States Department of Transportation<====>58235<====>United States Department of Transportation  The United States Department of Transportation (USDOT or DOT) is a federal Cabinet department of the U. S.  government concerned with transportation.  It was established by an act of Congress on October 15, 1966, and began operation on April 1, 1967.

Bach was an influential composer working at a time of transition between his father's baroque style and the classical and romantic styles that followed it.  His personal approach, an expressive and often turbulent one known as   or 'sensitive style', applied the principles of rhetoric and drama to musical structures.

All U.S. states, Canadian provinces, and many local agencies also have similar organizations and provide enforcement through DOT officers within their respective jurisdictions.List of U.S. state and insular area departments of transportationAlabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT)Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (DOT&PF)Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT)Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department (AHTD)California Department of Transportation (Caltrans)Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT)Connecticut Department of Transportation (CONNDOT)Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT)Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT)Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT)Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT)Idaho Transportation Department (ITD)Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT)Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT)Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT)Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT)Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC)Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD)Maine Department of Transportation (MaineDOT)Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT)Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT)Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT)Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT)Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT)Montana Department of Transportation (MDT)NebraskaNebraska Department of Roads (NDOR) - roads, rail, and public transportationNebraska Department of Aeronautics - airportsNebraska Game and Parks Commission - waterwaysNevada Department of Transportation (NDOT)New Hampshire Department of Transportation (NHDOT)New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT)New Mexico Department of Transportation (NMDOT)New YorkNew York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT)New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA)North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT)North Dakota Department of Transportation (NDDOT)Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT)Oklahoma Department of Transportation (ODOT)Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT)Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT)Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTOP)Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT)South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT)South Dakota Department of Transportation (SDDOT)Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT)Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT)Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans)Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT)Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT)West Virginia Department of Transportation (WVDOT)Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT)Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT)Local departments of transportationDistrict of Columbia Department of Transportation (d. – pronounced dee-dot)Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT)New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT)Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT)Detroit Department of Transportation (D-DOT)Canadian provincial departments of transportation Transport Canada – Canadian national DOTAlberta Department of Infrastructure and TransportationBritish Columbia Ministry of TransportationManitoba Infrastructure and TransportationDepartment of Transportation (New Brunswick)Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Transportation and WorksNova Scotia Department of Transportation and Infrastructure RenewalMinistry of Transportation (Ontario) (MTO)Prince Edward Island Department of Transportation and Public WorksMinistère des Transports du Quebec (MTQ)Saskatchewan Department of Highways and TransportationSee alsoMinistry of Transport – the term used in many other countriesReferences External linksA list of U.S. state DOTs

Bacharach<====>58241<====>Bacharach  Bacharach ( , also known as Bacharach am Rhein) is a town in the Mainz-Bingen district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.  It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Rhein-Nahe, whose seat is in Bingen am Rhein, although that town is not within its bounds. The original name Baccaracus points to Celtic beginnings.  Above the town looms Stahleck Castle (Burg Stahleck), nowadays a youth hostel. GeographyLocationThe town lies in the Rhine Gorge, 48 km south of Koblenz. Constituent communitiesBacharach is divided into several Ortsteile.  The outlying centre of Steeg lies in the Steeg Valley (Steeger Tal) off to the side, away from the Rhine. 

Louis Petit de Bachaumont<====>58242<====>Louis Petit de BachaumontLouis Petit de Bachaumont ( ) (June 2, 1690 – April 29, 1771) was a  French writer, whose historical interest has been connected largely to his alleged role in the gossipy  Mémoires secrets pour servir à l'histoire de la République des Lettres.  A modern biography  brought to general attention his other roles, as an arbiter of taste, an influential art critic and an urbaniste. Petit de Bachaumont was of noble family and was brought up at the court of Versailles.  He passed his whole life in Paris, however, as the centre of the salon of Mme Doublet de Persan (1677–1771), where criticism of art and literature took the form of malicious gossip. 

Cordite<====>58244<====>Cordite  Cordite is a family of smokeless propellants developed and produced in the United Kingdom since 1889 to replace gunpowder as a military propellant.  Like gunpowder, cordite is classified as a low explosive because of its slow burning rates and consequently low brisance.  These produce a subsonic deflagration wave rather than the supersonic detonation wave produced by brisants, or high explosives.  The hot gases produced by burning gunpowder or cordite generate sufficient pressure to propel a bullet or shell to its target, but not so quickly as to routinely destroy the barrel of the gun. Cordite was used initially in the . 

Ethnic groups in Chinese history<====>58245<====>Ethnic groups in Chinese historyEthnic groups in Chinese history refer to various or presumed ethnicities of significance to the history of China, gathered through the study of Classical Chinese literature, Chinese and non-Chinese literary sources and inscriptions, historical linguistics, and archaeological research. Among the difficulties in the study of ethnic groups in China are the relatively long periods of time involved, together with the large volume of literary and historical records which have accompanied the history of China.  Classical Chinese ethnography (like much then-contemporary ethnography) was often sketchy, leaving it unclear as to whether Chinese-depicted names referred to a true ethnic group or a possibly multiethnic political entity. 

Nitrocellulose<====>58246<====>Nitrocellulose   Nitrocellulose (also known as cellulose nitrate, flash paper, flash cotton, guncotton, and flash string) is a highly flammable compound formed by nitrating cellulose through exposure to nitric acid or another powerful nitrating agent.  When used as a propellant or low-order explosive, it was originally known as guncotton. Partially nitrated cellulose has found uses as a plastic film and in inks and wood coatings.   In 1862 the first man-made plastic, nitrocellulose (branded Parkesine), was created by Alexander Parkes from cellulose treated with nitric acid and a solvent.  In 1868, American inventor John Wesley Hyatt developed a plastic material he named Celluloid, improving on Parkes' invention by plasticizing the nitrocellulose with camphor so that it could be processed into finished form and used as a photographic film. 

Earl<====>58249<====>Earl    An earl    is a member of the nobility.  The title is Anglo-Saxon in origin, akin to the Scandinavian form jarl, and meant "chieftain", particularly a chieftain set to rule a territory in a king's stead.  In Scandinavia, it became obsolete in the Middle Ages and was replaced by duke (hertig/hertug/hertog).  In later medieval Britain, it became the equivalent of the continental count (in England in the earlier period, it was more akin to a duke; in Scotland it assimilated the concept of mormaer).  However, earlier in Scandinavia, jarl could also mean a sovereign prince. 

United States Department of Health and Human Services<====>58250<====>United States Department of Health and Human Services    The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), also known as the Health Department, is a cabinet-level department of the U. S.  federal government with the goal of protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services.  Its motto is "Improving the health, safety, and well-being of America".   Before the separate federal Department of Education was created in 1979, it was called the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW). History  Federal Security AgencyThe Federal Security Agency (FSA) was established on July 1, 1939, under the Reorganization Act of 1939, P. 

Nickel–metal hydride battery<====>58251<====>Nickel–metal hydride battery    A nickel–metal hydride battery, abbreviated NiMH or Ni–MH, is a type of rechargeable battery.  The chemical reaction at the positive electrode is similar to that of the nickel–cadmium cell (NiCd), with both  using  nickel oxide hydroxide (NiOOH).  However, the negative electrodes use a hydrogen-absorbing alloy instead of cadmium.  A NiMH battery can have two to three times the capacity of an equivalent size NiCd, and its energy density can approach that of a lithium-ion battery. History Work on NiMH batteries began at the Battelle-Geneva Research Center following the technology's invention in 1967. 

Marquess<====>58253<====>MarquessA marquess ( ;   ,  ;  Italian: marchese,  Spanish: marqués,  ) is a nobleman of hereditary rank in various European peerages and in those of some of their former colonies.  The term is also used to translate equivalent Asian styles, as in imperial China and Japan. In the German lands, a Margrave was a ruler of an immediate Imperial territory (examples include the Margrave of Brandenburg, the Margrave of Baden and the Margrave of Bayreuth), not simply a nobleman like a marquess or marquis in Western and Southern Europe. 

Peerages in the United Kingdom<====>58254<====>Peerages in the United Kingdom  The peerage is a legal system comprising both hereditary and lifetime titles in the United Kingdom (as elsewhere in Europe), composed of various noble ranks, and forming a constituent part of the British honours system. The term peerage can be used both collectively to refer to the entire body of nobles (or a subdivision thereof), and individually to refer to a specific title (modern English language-style using an initial capital in the former case but not the latter).  British peerage title holders are termed peers of the Realm. Under present custom, only members of the royal family are nowadays created hereditary peers; the last non-royal creations of hereditary titles being in the Thatcher era, since when Her Majesty's Government (HMG) (whether Conservative or Labour) has refrained from such recommendations. 

Duke<====>58255<====>Duke   A duke (male) (British English:    or American English:   ) or duchess (female) can either be a monarch ruling over a duchy or a member of the nobility, historically of highest rank below the monarch.  The title comes from French duc, itself from the Latin dux, 'leader', a term used in republican Rome to refer to a military commander without an official rank (particularly one of Germanic or Celtic origin), and later coming to mean the leading military commander of a province. The title dux survived in the Eastern Roman Empire where it was used in several contexts signifying a rank equivalent to a captain or general. 

Wax<====>58256<====>Wax Waxes are a diverse class of organic compounds that are lipophilic, malleable solids near ambient temperatures.   They include higher alkanes and lipids, typically with melting points above about 40 °C (104 °F), melting to give low viscosity liquids.  Waxes are insoluble in water but soluble in organic, nonpolar solvents.   Natural waxes of different types are produced by plants and animals and occur in petroleum. ChemistryWaxes are organic compounds that characteristically consist of long alkyl chains.   They may also include various functional groups such as fatty acids, primary and secondary long chain alcohols, unsaturated bonds, aromatics, amides, ketones, and aldehydes. 

Honeycomb<====>58258<====>Honeycomb A honeycomb is a mass of hexagonal prismatic wax cells built by honey bees in their nests to contain their larvae and stores of honey and pollen. Beekeepers may remove the entire honeycomb to harvest honey.  Honey bees consume about 8. 4 lb (3. 8 kg) of honey to secrete 1 lb (454 g) of wax,  so it makes economic sense to return the wax to the hive after harvesting the honey.  The structure of the comb may be left basically intact when honey is extracted from it by uncapping and spinning in a centrifugal machine—the honey extractor.  If the honeycomb is too worn out, the wax can be reused in a number of ways, including making sheets of comb foundation with hexagonal pattern. 

Honey bee<====>58261<====>Honey bee   A honey bee (or honeybee) is any member of the genus Apis, primarily distinguished by the production and storage of honey and the construction of  , colonial nests from wax.  In the early 21st century, only seven species of honey bee are recognized, with a total of 44 subspecies,    though historically six to eleven species are recognized.  The best known honey bee is the Western honey bee which has been domesticated for honey production and crop pollination.  Honey bees represent only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000 known species of bees. 

List of counties in Alabama<====>58263<====>List of counties in Alabama   The U. S.  state of Alabama has 67 counties.   Each county serves as the local level of government within its borders.  The land enclosed by the present state borders was joined to the United States of America gradually.  Following the American Revolutionary War, West Florida was ceded to Spain by treaty while the remainder was organized primarily as the Mississippi Territory, and later the Alabama Territory.The territorial assembly established some of the earliest county divisions that have survived to the present, including the earliest county formation, that of Washington County, created on June 4, 1800. 

Fig wasp<====>58264<====>Fig wasp Fig wasps are wasps of the superfamily Chalcidoidea which spend their larval stage inside figs.  Most are pollinators but others simply feed off the plant.  The non-pollinators belong to several groups within the superfamily Chalcidoidea, while the pollinators are in the family Agaonidae.  While pollinating fig wasps are gall-makers, the remaining types either make their own galls or usurp the galls of other fig wasps; reports of them being parasitoids are considered dubious.  HistoryAristotle recorded in his History of Animals that the fruits of the wild fig (the caprifig) contain psenes (fig wasps); these begin life as grubs (larvae), and the adult psen splits its "skin" (pupa) and flies out of the fig to find and enter a cultivated fig, saving it from dropping. 

List of counties in Delaware<====>58265<====>List of counties in Delaware  The United States state of Delaware has only three counties: New Castle, Kent, and Sussex, the fewest in the United States.   The origin of the county boundaries goes back to former court districts.  The powers of the counties' legislative bodies are limited to issues such as zoning and development. Politics and governmentEach county elects a legislative body (known in New Castle and Sussex counties as the County Council, and in Kent County as the Levy Court).  The counties are able to  raise taxes and borrow money.  They also have control over garbage disposal, water supply, sewerage, zoning, development, and building codes. 

Conceptual schema<====>58267<====>Conceptual schema  A 'conceptual schema' is a high-level description of a business's informational needs.   It typically includes only the main concepts and the main relationships among them.   Typically this is a first-cut model, with insufficient detail to build an actual database.  This level describes the structure of the whole database for a group of users.  The conceptual model is also known as the data model that can be used to describe the conceptual schema when a database system is implemented.  It hides the internal details of physical storage and targets on describing entities, datatype, relationships and constraints. 

Sydney, Nova Scotia<====>58268<====>Sydney, Nova Scotia  Sydney is a population centre and former city in Nova Scotia, Canada.   Situated on Cape Breton Island's east coast, it belongs administratively to the Cape Breton Regional Municipality.  Sydney was founded in 1785 by the British; it was incorporated as a city in 1904, and dissolved on 1 August 1995, when it was amalgamated into the regional municipality.  It served as the Cape Breton Island colony's capital, until 1820, when the colony merged with Nova Scotia and the capital moved to Halifax. A rapid population expansion occurred just after the turn of the 20th century, when Sydney was home to one of North America's main steel mills. 

List of counties in Florida<====>58273<====>List of counties in Florida  There are 67 counties in the state of Florida.  It became a territory of the U. S.  in 1821 with two counties complementing the provincial divisions retained as a Spanish territory: Escambia to the west and St.  Johns to the east, divided by the Suwannee River.  All of the other counties were apportioned from these two original counties.  Florida became the 27th U. S.  state in 1845, and its last county was created in 1925 with the formation of Gilchrist County from a segment of Alachua County.Florida's counties are subdivisions of the state government. 

List of counties in Idaho<====>58275<====>List of counties in Idaho  There are 44 counties in the U. S.  state of Idaho. The Idaho Territory was organized in March 1863, and Owyhee County was the first county in the territory to be organized, in December of that year.  Oneida County was organized in January 1864, while Missoula County was adopted the same month, before becoming part of the new Montana Territory in May.  Shoshone, Nez Perce, Idaho and Boise Counties were recognized in February 1864; Alturas County was organized the same month.  In December 1864, Kootenai and Ada Counties were created; Lah-Toh County was also created at this time but was abolished in 1867. 

List of counties in Indiana<====>58276<====>List of counties in Indiana  The U. S.  state of Indiana has 92 counties.  Each county serves as the local level of government within its borders.  Although Indiana was organized into the United States since the Northwest Ordinance in 1787, its land was not always available for settlement.  Eventually, land was purchased from Native Americans by treaties and Indian removals.  The oldest counties are generally in the south near the Ohio River, whereas newer ones were in the north in territory acquired later.   The oldest and newest counties in Indiana are Knox County, created in 1790, and Newton County, created in 1859. 

List of counties in Iowa<====>58277<====>List of counties in Iowa  There are 99 counties in the U. S.  state of Iowa.  The first two counties, Des Moines County and Dubuque County, were created in 1834 when Iowa was still part of the Michigan Territory.  In preparation for Michigan's statehood, part of Michigan Territory was formed into Wisconsin Territory in 1836.   Two years later, the western portion was split off to become Iowa Territory.   The south-eastern part of Iowa Territory became Iowa, the 29th state in the union, on 28 December 1846,  by which point 44 counties had been created. 

List of counties in Kansas<====>58278<====>List of counties in Kansas  This is a list of counties in the U. S.  state of Kansas.  Select from the links at right to go directly to an article, or browse the listing below for additional information.   Every license plate issued by the state contains the same two-letter abbreviation for the county in which its vehicle is registered. Kansas has 105 counties, the sixth-highest total of any state.   Many of the counties in the eastern part of the state are named after prominent Americans from the late 18th and early-to-mid-19th centuries, while those in the central and western part of the state are named for figures in the American Civil War. 

Diffusivity<====>58279<====>Diffusivity Diffusivity is a rate of diffusion, a measure of the rate at which particles or heat or fluids can spread.It is measured differently for different mediums.Diffusivity may refer to:Thermal diffusivity, diffusivity of heatDiffusivity of mass:Mass diffusivity, molecular diffusivity (often called "diffusion coefficient")Eddy diffusion, eddy diffusivityKinematic viscosity, characterising momentum diffusivityMagnetic diffusivityReferences   

List of counties in Maine<====>58281<====>List of counties in Maine  This is a list of the sixteen counties in the U. S.  state of Maine.  Before statehood, Maine was officially part of the state of Massachusetts and was called the District of Maine.  Maine was granted statehood on March 15, 1820 as part of the Missouri Compromise.  Nine of the sixteen counties had their borders defined while Maine was still part of Massachusetts, and hence are older than the state itself.    Even after 1820, the exact location of the northern border of Maine was disputed with Britain, until the question was settled and the northern counties signed their final official form, the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, signed in 1842. 

Thermal diffusivity<====>58282<====>Thermal diffusivityIn heat transfer analysis, thermal diffusivity is the thermal conductivity divided by density and specific heat capacity at constant pressure.   It measures the rate of transfer of heat of a material from the hot side to the cold side.  It has the SI derived unit of m²/s.  Thermal diffusivity is usually denoted α but a, κ,  K,    and D are also used.   The formula is: \alpha = {k \over {\rho c_p}}  where k  is thermal conductivity (W/(m·K)) \rho  is density (kg/m³) c_p  is specific heat capacity (J/(kg·K))Together,  \rho c_p\,  can be considered the volumetric heat capacity (J/(m³·K)). 

Prandtl number<====>58283<====>Prandtl number The Prandtl number  (Pr) or Prandtl group is a dimensionless number, named after the German physicist Ludwig Prandtl, defined as the ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity.    That is, the Prandtl number is given as: \mathrm{Pr} = \frac{\nu}{\alpha} = \frac{\mbox{viscous diffusion rate}}{\mbox{thermal diffusion rate}} = \frac{\mu / \rho}{k / (c_p \rho)} = \frac{c_p \mu}{k} where: \nu  : momentum diffusivity (kinematic viscosity),  \nu = \mu/\rho , (SI units: m 2 /s) \alpha  : thermal diffusivity,  \alpha = k/(\rho c_p) , (SI units: m 2 /s) \mu  : dynamic viscosity, (SI units: Pa s = N s/m 2 ) k  : thermal conductivity, (SI units: W/m-K) c_p  : specific heat, (SI units: J/kg-K) \rho  : density, (SI units: kg/m 3 ).Note that whereas the Reynolds number and Grashof number are subscripted with a length scale variable, the Prandtl number contains no such length scale in its definition and is dependent only on the fluid and the fluid state. As such, the Prandtl number is often found in property tables alongside other properties such as viscosity and thermal conductivity.For most gases over a wide range of temperature and pressure,   is approximately constant. Therefore, it can be used to determine the thermal conductivity of gases at high temperatures, where it is difficult to measure experimentally due to the formation of convection currents. Typical values for   are:0.003 for molten potassium at 975 K around 0.015 for mercuryaround 0.16-0.7 for mixtures of noble gases or noble gases with hydrogen0.63 for oxygen 0.065 for molten lithium at 975 K around 0.7-0.8 for air and many other gases1.38 for gaseous ammonia between 4 and 5 for R-12 refrigerantaround 7 for water (At 20 °C)13.4 and 7.2 for seawater (At 0 °C and 20 °C respectively)50 for n-butanol between 100 and 40,000 for engine oil1000 for glycerol 10,000 for polymer melts around 1  for Earth's mantle.Small values of the Prandtl number,  , means the thermal diffusivity dominates. Whereas with large values,  , the momentum diffusivity dominates the behavior.For example, the listed value for liquid mercury indicates that the heat conduction is more significant compared to convection, so thermal diffusivity is dominant.However, for engine oil, convection is very effective in transferring energy from an area in comparison to pure conduction, so momentum diffusivity is dominant.In heat transfer problems, the Prandtl number controls the relative thickness of the momentum and thermal boundary layers. When   is small, it means that the heat diffuses quickly compared to the velocity (momentum). This means that for liquid metals the thickness of the thermal boundary layer is much bigger than the velocity boundary layer.The mass transfer analog of the Prandtl number is the Schmidt number.See alsoTurbulent Prandtl numberMagnetic Prandtl number References  

Nusselt number<====>58285<====>Nusselt numberIn heat transfer at a boundary (surface) within a fluid, the Nusselt number (Nu) is the ratio of convective to conductive heat transfer across (normal to) the boundary.  In this context, convection includes both advection and diffusion.  Named after Wilhelm Nusselt, it is a dimensionless number.   The conductive component is measured under the same conditions as the heat convection but with a (hypothetically) stagnant (or motionless) fluid.  A similar non-dimensional parameter is Biot number, with the difference that the thermal conductivity is of the solid body and not the fluid. A Nusselt number close to one, namely convection and conduction of similar magnitude, is characteristic of "slug flow" or laminar flow. 

Native American gaming<====>58286<====>Native American gaming Native American gaming comprises casinos, bingo halls, and other gambling operations on Indian reservations or other tribal land in the United States.  Because these areas have tribal sovereignty, states have limited ability to forbid gambling there, as codified by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988.   As of 2011, there were 460 gambling operations run by 240 tribes,  with a total annual revenue of $27 billion.  History In the early 1970s, Russell and Helen Bryan, a married Chippewa couple living in a mobile home on Indian lands in northern Minnesota, received a property tax bill from the local county, Itasca County. 

Grashof number<====>58287<====>Grashof number The Grashof number (Gr) is a dimensionless number in fluid dynamics and heat transfer which approximates the ratio of the buoyancy to viscous force acting on a fluid.  It frequently arises in the study of situations involving natural convection and is analogous to the Reynolds number.It's believed to be named after Franz Grashof.  Though this grouping of terms had already been in use, it wasn't named until around 1921, 28 years after Franz Grashof's death.  It's not very clear why the grouping was named after him.   Sander, C. 

Louse<====>58288<====>LouseLouse (plural: lice) is the common name for members of the order Phthiraptera, which contains nearly 5,000 species of wingless insect.  Lice are obligate parasites, living externally on warm-blooded hosts which include every species of bird and mammal, except for monotremes, pangolins, bats and cetaceans.  Lice are vectors of diseases such as typhus. Chewing lice live among the hairs or feathers of their host and feed on skin and debris, while sucking lice pierce the host's skin and feed on blood and other secretions.  They usually spend their whole life on a single host, cementing their eggs, which are known as nits, to hairs or feathers. 

Pequot<====>58289<====>Pequot  The Pequot (pronounced  )  are Native American people of the U. S.  state of Connecticut.  Modern Pequot and their descendants are members of the federally recognized Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, four other state-recognized groups in Connecticut, and the Brothertown Indians of Wisconsin.  Pritzker, Barry (2000) A Native American Encyclopedia: History, Culture, and Peoples, pp.  656–657.  Oxford University Press.   .   They traditionally spoke Pequot, a dialect of the Mohegan-Pequot language which became extinct in the early 20th century, though revival efforts are under way. The Pequot and Mohegan were formerly a single group, but the Mohegan split off in the 17th century as the Pequot came to control much of present-day Connecticut. 

Mashantucket Pequot Tribe<====>58290<====>Mashantucket Pequot Tribe  The Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation is a federally recognized Native American nation in the state of Connecticut.  They are descended from the Pequot people, an Algonquian-language tribe that dominated the southern New England coastal areas.  Within their reservation in Ledyard, New London County, the Mashantucket Pequot own and operate Foxwoods Resort Casino.  As of 2012, it is the world's largest resort casino in terms of gambling space and number of slot machines. Until 2007, the casino was one of the most economically successful in the United States, Jessica Durkin, "Mashantucket Election Returns Council Incumbents," Norwich Bulletin, 7 November 2005  but by 2012, the casino was deeply in debt due to its expansion and changing conditions. 

Mallophaga<====>58291<====>Mallophaga The Mallophaga are a suborder of lice, known as chewing lice, biting lice or bird lice, containing more than 3000 species.  These lice are external parasites that feed mainly on birds, although some species also feed on mammals.  They infest both domestic and wild animals and birds, and cause considerable irritation to their hosts.They have paurometabolis or incomplete metamorphosis.   CharacteristicsAbout 3000 species of Mallophaga are in the world.  They are easily identifiable by their heads, which are wider than their prothoraces.  The species that feed on birds typically have two claws on the end of each tarsus, while those that feed on mammals typically have just a single claw. 

Hmong people<====>58294<====>Hmong people    The Hmong/Mong (RPA: Hmoob/Moob,  ) is an indigenous people in Asia.  They are also one of the sub-groups of the Miao ethnicity (苗族) in China.  The Hmong began a gradual southward migration in China in the 18th century due to political unrest and to escape Chinese threats. Thousands of economic and political refugees have resettled in Western countries in two separate waves.  The first wave resettled in the late 1970s, mostly in the United States, after the North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao takeovers of the pro-US governments in South Vietnam and Laos respectively. 

California Gold Rush<====>58296<====>California Gold Rush    The California Gold Rush (1848–1855) began on January 24, 1848, when gold was found by James W.  Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California.   The news of gold brought some 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad.   The sudden influx of immigration and gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy, and California became one of the few American states to go directly to statehood without first being a territory, in the Compromise of 1850.  The Gold Rush had severe effects on Native Californians and resulted in a precipitous population decline from disease, genocide and starvation. 

Swedish colonies in the Americas<====>58298<====>Swedish colonies in the Americas  Sweden established colonies in the Americas in the mid-17th century, including the colony of New Sweden (1638–1655) on the Delaware River in what is now Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, as well as two possessions in the Caribbean during the 18th and 19th centuries. North AmericaThe colony of New Sweden was founded in 1638 by the first expedition of Swedish South Company, a consortium of Swedish, Dutch and German business interests formed in 1637.  A Brief History of New Sweden in America (The Swedish Colonial Society)The colony was located along the Delaware River with settlements in modern Delaware (e. 

Opera Australia<====>58299<====>Opera AustraliaOpera Australia is the principal opera company in Australia.  Based in Sydney, its performance season at the Sydney Opera House accompanied by the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra runs for approximately eight months of the year, with the remainder of its time spent in the Arts Centre Melbourne, where it is accompanied by Orchestra Victoria.  In 2004, the company gave 226 performances in its subscription seasons in Sydney and Melbourne, attended by more than 294,000 people. Like most opera companies, it is funded by a combination of government money, corporate sponsorship, private philanthropy, and ticket sales.  The proportion of its revenue from ticket sales is considerably higher than that of most companies, approximately 75 per cent. 

List of counties in Michigan<====>58300<====>List of counties in Michigan  There are 83 counties in the U. S.  state of Michigan.  The boundaries of these counties have not changed substantially since 1897.  However, throughout the 19th century, the state legislature frequently adjusted county boundaries.  County creation was intended to fulfill the goal of establishing government over unorganized territory, but a more important goal was encouraging settlement by surveying the land and dividing it into saleable sections. The creation of counties generally occurred in two stages.  First the boundaries of a county were declared and given a name.  The county appeared on maps, even though this may have been the entire extent of a county's tangible existence for several years.

Sucking louse<====>58302<====>Sucking louse Sucking lice (Anoplura, formerly known as Siphunculata) have around 500 species and represent the smaller of the two traditional suborders of lice.  As opposed to the paraphyletic chewing lice, which are now divided among three suborders, the sucking lice are monophyletic. The Anoplura are all blood-feeding ectoparasites of mammals.  They only occur on about 20% of all placentalian mammal species, and are unknown from several orders of mammals (Monotremata, Edentata, Pholidota, Chiroptera, Cetacea, Sirenia and Proboscidea).   They can cause localized skin irritations and are vectors of several blood-borne diseases.  Children appear particularly susceptible to attracting lice, possibly due to their fine hair.

counties. The land that eventually became Wisconsin was transferred from British to American control with the 1783 signing of the Treaty of Paris.    It was an unorganized part of the Northwest Territory until 1802 when all of the land from St. Louis north to the Canadian border was organized as St. Clair County.   When Illinois was admitted to the union in 1818, Wisconsin became part of the Territory of Michigan and divided into two counties: Brown County in the northeast along Lake Michigan and Crawford County in the southwest along the Mississippi River.  Iowa County was formed in 1829 from the Crawford County land south of the Wisconsin River.  Brown County's southern portion was used to form Milwaukee County in 1834.  The state of Wisconsin was created from Wisconsin Territory on May 29, 1848, with 28 counties.Counties in Wisconsin are governed by county boards, headed by a chairperson. Counties with a population of 500,000 or more must also have a county executive.  Smaller counties may have either a county executive or a county administrator.  As of 2011, 13 counties had elected county executives: Brown, Chippewa, Dane, Fond du Lac, Kenosha, Manitowoc, Milwaukee, Outagamie, Portage, Racine, Sawyer, Waukesha, and Winnebago. 23 had an appointed county administrator, 34 had an appointed administrative coordinator, and 2 had neither an executive nor an administrator. Waukesha County had both an executive and an administrator. Each county has a county seat, often a populous or centrally located community, where the county's governmental offices are located. Some of the services provided by the county include: law enforcement, circuit courts, social services, vital records and deed registration, road maintenance, and snow removal. County officials include sheriffs, district attorneys, clerks, treasurers, coroners, surveyors, registers of deeds, and clerks of circuit court; these officers are elected for four-year terms. In most counties, elected coroners have been replaced by appointed medical examiners. State law permits counties to appoint a registered land surveyor in place of electing a surveyor.The most populous county in the state is Milwaukee County at 947,735 people at the 2010 census.  Its population is bolstered by the city of Milwaukee's 594,833 people.  The county with the least population is Menominee County with 4,232 residents; the Menominee Indian Reservation is co-extensive with the county.  Pepin County is the smallest in area, with  ; Marathon is the largest, having  . The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry.  Wisconsin's code is 55, which when combined with any county code would be written as 55XXX. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county.

List of counties in Wyoming<====>58314<====>List of counties in Wyoming  This is a list of counties in Wyoming.  There are 23 counties in the U. S.  state of Wyoming.  There were originally five counties in the Wyoming Territory: Laramie and Carter, established in 1867; Carbon and Albany established in 1868; and Uinta, an annexed portion of Utah and Idaho, extending from Montana (including Yellowstone Park) to the Wyoming-Utah boundary.On July 10, 1890, Wyoming was admitted to the Union with thirteen counties in it.  Ten more counties were created after statehood.  Three counties were renamed after their creation. 

Haematomyzus<====>58316<====>Haematomyzus  The genus Haematomyzus includes three species of lice that differ so markedly from all other lice that they have been placed in a suborder of their own.  These unusual lice are ectoparasites of elephants and warthogs.  Their mouthparts are elongated to form a drill-like structure that allows them to penetrate the thick skin of their host. TaxonomyThe three species, Haematomyzus elephantis (the elephant louse), Haematomyzus hopkinsi and Haematomyzus porci (warthog lice) belong to a single family, the Haematomyzidae.  Host recordsH.  elephantis is known from both the African and Asian Elephant.   NotesThe first spelling of "Rhyncophthirina" by Ferris was a lapse, and in subsequent use of the term he spelled it "Rhynchophthirina" adding the second "h". 

Ischnocera<====>58317<====>Ischnocera   The Ischnocera is a large suborder of lice mostly parasitic on birds but including a large family (the Trichodectidae) parasitic on mammals.  The genus  Trichophilopterus is also found on mammals (lemurs) but probably belongs to the "avian Ischnocera" and represents a host switch from birds to mammals.  It is a chewing louse, which feeds on the feathers and skin debris of birds.  Many of the avian Ischnocera have evolved an elongated body shape.  This allows them to conceal themselves between the feather shafts and avoid being dislodged during preening or flight. The taxonomy of the group is in need of revision. 

Amblycera<====>58318<====>Amblycera  The Amblycera are a large suborder of chewing lice, parasitic on both birds and mammals.  The Amblycera are considered the most primitive suborder of lice. DescriptionThese insects are very much like the familiar advanced sucking lice, except they do not stay on their host permanently.  They roam freely over the surface of their host and, unlike other lice, do not form permanent attachments.  They feed by chewing soft areas of skin, causing an area of localized bleeding from which they drink. Species of this suborder have antennae but they cannot readily be seen because they lie in grooves in the side of the head. 

Serial code<====>58319<====>Serial code  A serial code is a unique identifier assigned incrementally or sequentially to an item.  It is also called a serial number, although it may be a character string that includes letters and other typographical symbols, not just numerical digits. Applications of serial numbering Serial numbers identify otherwise identical individual units with many, obvious uses.   Serial numbers are a deterrent against theft and counterfeit products, as they can be recorded, and stolen or otherwise irregular goods can be identified.  Banknotes and other transferable documents of value bear serial numbers to assist in preventing counterfeiting and tracing stolen ones. 

Potential flow<====>58320<====>Potential flow In fluid dynamics, potential flow describes the velocity field as the gradient of a scalar function: the velocity potential.  As a result, a potential flow is characterized by an irrotational velocity field, which is a valid approximation for several applications.  The irrotationality of a potential flow is due to the curl of the gradient of a scalar always being equal to zero. In the case of an incompressible flow the velocity potential satisfies Laplace's equation, and potential theory is applicable.  However, potential flows also have been used to describe compressible flows.  The potential flow approach occurs in the modeling of both stationary as well as nonstationary flows. 

Psychic<====>58323<====>Psychic  A psychic is a person who claims to use extrasensory perception (ESP) to identify information hidden from the normal senses, particularly involving telepathy or clairvoyance, or who performs acts that are apparently inexplicable by natural laws.  Many people believe in psychic abilities, but there is no scientific consensus as to the actual existence of such powers.  The word "psychic" is also used as an adjective to describe such abilities.  In this meaning, this word has some synonyms, as parapsychic or metapsychic. Psychics encompass people in a variety of roles.  Some are theatrical performers, such as stage magicians, who use various techniques, e. 

Mao (card game)<====>58324<====>Mao (card game)   Mao (or Mau ) is a card game of the shedding family, in which the aim is to get rid of all of the cards in hand without breaking certain unspoken rules.  The game is from a subset of the Stops family and is similar in structure to the card game Uno or Crazy Eights.   (offline, see Internet Archive) The game forbids its players from explaining the rules, and new players are often informed that "the only rule you may be told is this one". 

Vigilante<====>58325<====>Vigilante  A vigilante ( ,  ;  ;  ,  ) is a civilian or organization acting in a law enforcement capacity (or in the pursuit of self-perceived justice) without legal authority. Vigilante conduct"Vigilante justice" is often rationalized by the concept that proper legal forms of criminal punishment are either nonexistent, insufficient, or inefficient.  Vigilantes normally see the government as ineffective in enforcing the law; such individuals often claim to justify their actions as a fulfillment of the wishes of the community. Persons alleged to be escaping the law or above the law are sometimes the victims of vigilantism. 

Miao, Arunachal Pradesh<====>58327<====>Miao, Arunachal Pradesh   Miao is a sub-division in Changlang district.  It is located about 25 km from the Assam border.  This place is one of the 60 constituencies of Arunachal.  Name of current MLA (October-2016) of Miao constituency is Kamlung Mossang.  Miao is located in a region where it gets one of the heaviest rainfall in the north-east India.  The nao-dihing is the most important river flowing through Miao.  The mountain range is called Patkai Bum and is the eastern extension of the Himalayas.  The tall forests make the region a good haven for smugglers. 

Klyuchevskaya Sopka<====>58331<====>Klyuchevskaya Sopka Klyuchevskaya Sopka ( ; also known as Klyuchevskoi,  ) is a stratovolcano, the highest mountain on the Kamchatka Peninsula of Russia and the highest active volcano of Eurasia.  Its steep, symmetrical cone towers about   from the Bering Sea.  The volcano is part of the natural Volcanoes of Kamchatka UNESCO World Heritage Site. Klyuchevskaya's first recorded eruption occurred in 1697, Global Volcanism Program: Kliuchevskoi, eruptive history.  Volcano. si. edu.  Retrieved on 2014-05-15.   and it has been almost continuously active ever since, as have many of its neighboring volcanoes.  It was first climbed in 1788 by Daniel Gauss and two other members of the Billings Expedition. 

Joseph Billings<====>58333<====>Joseph BillingsJoseph Billings ( 1758 1806) was an English navigator and explorer who spent the most significant part of his life in Russian service. LifeThe Billings ExpeditionIn 1785, the Russian government of Catherine the Great commissioned a new expedition in search for the Northeast Passage, led by English officer Joseph Billings, who had previously sailed with Captain Cook, and the Russian officer Gavril Sarychev as his deputy and Carl Heinrich Merck as the expedition's naturalist.    This enterprise operated till 1795. Though considered a failure by some scholars because the expenditures outweighed the results, it nevertheless had a substantial record of achievement. 

Let It Ride (card game)<====>58334<====>Let It Ride (card game)Let It Ride is a casino table game based on poker, where the player wagers on a five-card poker hand formed by their own three cards and two community cards.  It is a product of Bally Technologies, under its Shuffle Master brand.  The game is played at a relaxed pace relative to other casino card games, which has made it attractive to older players and to table game neophytes.  Initially found in many casinos, the popularity of Let It Ride has waned over the past 15 years, because of the large percentage edge the house has on this game. 

Cape Dezhnev<====>58337<====>Cape Dezhnev Cape Dezhnyov or Cape Dezhnev ( ; formerly East Cape or Cape Vostochny) is a cape that forms the eastmost mainland point of Asia.  It is located on the Chukchi Peninsula in the very thinly populated Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of Russia.  This cape is located between the Chukchi Sea and the Bering Strait,   across from Cape Prince of Wales in Alaska; the Bering Strait is delimited by the two capes.  The Diomede Islands and Fairway Rock are located in the midst of the strait. GeographyIn 1898, the cape was officially renamed as Cape Dezhnev, replacing Captain James Cook's name, the "East Cape". 

Fan Chuo (Tang dynasty)<====>58339<====>Fan Chuo (Tang dynasty)  Fan Chuo (Traditional Chinese: 樊綽; Simplified Chinese: 樊绰; pinyin: fán chuò; previously romanized as Fan Ch'e and Fan Zhuo) (??? – late 9th century) was a secretary working under the Jie-du (Traditional Chinese: 節度; Simplified Chinese: 节度; pinyin: jié dù) (similar to the Byzantine thema) with headquarters located at Hanoi. Since the thema was a front of the Tang Dynasty against Nanzhao, he was able to get his hands on the updated diplomatic and military documents of the two countries.  He also lived in Hanoi during his first tenure; therefore he knew some firsthand information of the city, such as trades, deployments, population, etc. 

Guilder<====>58341<====>Guilder Guilder is the English translation of the Dutch and German gulden, originally shortened from Middle High German guldin pfenninc "gold penny".  This was the term that became current in the southern and western parts of the Holy Roman Empire for the Fiorino d'oro (introduced 1252).   Hence, the name has often been interchangeable with florin (currency sign  ƒ.  or  ƒl. ). Early versionsThe term gulden was used in the Holy Roman Empire during the 14th to 16th centuries in generic reference to gold coins.  Currency became more standardized with the imperial reform of 1559. 

Sergey Kirov<====>58349<====>Sergey Kirov   Sergei Mironovich Kirov  (born Kostrikov;    – 1 December 1934) was a prominent early Bolshevik leader in the Soviet Union.  Kirov rose through the Communist Party ranks to become head of the party organization in Leningrad. On 1 December 1934, Kirov was shot and killed by a gunman at his offices in the Smolny Institute.  Some historians place the blame for his assassination at the hands of Joseph Stalin and believe the NKVD organized his execution, but conclusive evidence for this claim remains lacking.   Kirov's death served as one of the pretexts for Stalin's escalation of repression against dissident elements of the Party, and disarming of the Party (every Party member was issued a revolver up to that time, when Stalin had them all taken away), culminating in the Great Purge of the late 1930s in which many of the Old Bolsheviks were arrested, expelled from the party, and executed.

Medicare (United States)<====>58353<====>Medicare (United States)  In the United States, Medicare is a single-payer, national social insurance program administered by the U. S.  federal government since 1966, currently   using about 30–50 private insurance companies across the United States under contract for administration.United States Medicare is funded by a payroll tax, premiums and surtaxes from beneficiaries, and general revenue.  It provides health insurance for Americans aged 65 and older who have worked and paid into the system through the payroll tax.  It also provides health insurance to younger people with some disability status as determined by the Social Security Administration, as well as people with end stage renal disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 

Medicare (Canada)<====>58354<====>Medicare (Canada)Medicare ( ) is the national health care system of Canada.  Canada has a publicly funded, single-payer health care system consisting of 13 provincial and territorial health insurance plans that provides universal health care coverage to Canadian citizens, permanent residents and certain temporary residents.  It is administered on a provincial or territorial basis, within the guidelines set by the federal government.   The formal terminology for the insurance system is provided by the Canada Health Act and the health insurance legislation of the individual provinces and territories. The name is a contraction of medical and care, and was used in the United States for health care programs since at least 1953. 

Evenks<====>58357<====>Evenks  The Evenks (also spelled Ewenki or Evenki) (autonym: Эвэнкил Evenkil;   Evenki;    ; formerly known as Tungus or Tunguz;   Khamnigan) are a Tungusic people of Northern Asia.  In Russia, the Evenks are recognized as one of the Indigenous peoples of the Russian North, with a population of  38,396 (2010 census).  In China, the Evenki form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People's Republic of China, with a population of 30,875 (2010 census).   There are 537 Evenks, called Khamnigan in Mongolian, in Mongolia (2015 census). 

Tryptophan<====>58358<====>Tryptophan  Tryptophan (abbreviated as Trp or W; encoded by the codon UGG) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins.  It contains an α-amino group,  an α-carboxylic acid group,  and a side chain indole, making it a non-polar aromatic amino acid.  It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it: it must be obtained from the diet.  Tryptophan is also a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin and the hormone melatonin.  Like other amino acids, tryptophan is a zwitterion at physiological pH where the amino group is protonated (–NH 3  + ; pK a  = 9. 

Kett's Rebellion<====>58359<====>Kett's Rebellion Kett's Rebellion was a revolt in Norfolk, England during the reign of Edward VI, largely in response to the enclosure of land.  It began at Wymondham on 8 July 1549 with a group of rebels destroying fences that had been put up by wealthy landowners.

Transformational grammar<====>58439<====>Transformational grammarTransformational grammar (TG) or transformational-generative grammar (TGG) is, in the study of linguistics, part of the theory of generative grammar, especially of naturally evolved languages, that considers grammar to be a system of rules that generate exactly those combinations of words which form grammatical sentences in a given language.  TG involves the use of defined operations called transformations to produce new sentences from existing ones.  Deep structure and surface structure Noam Chomsky’s 1965 book Aspects of the Theory of Syntax developed the idea that each sentence in a language has two levels of representation — a deep structure and a surface structure.

Backscratcher<====>58463<====>Backscratcher A backscratcher (occasionally known as a scratch-back)  is a tool used, as the name would suggest, for relieving areas that cannot easily be reached just by one's own hands, typically the back. Composition and variationThey are generally long, slender, rod-shaped, tools good for scratching one's back, with a knob on one end for holding and a rake-like device, sometimes in the form of a human hand, on the other end to perform the actual scratching.  Many others are shaped like horse hooves, claws, or are retractable, to reach further down the back.  Though a backscratcher could feasibly be fashioned from most materials, most modern backscratchers are made of plastic, though examples can be found made of wood, whalebone, tortoiseshell, horn, cane, bamboo, ivory, baleen and in some cases in history; narwhal tusks, due to the increased social hierarchy that generally accompanied relieving itches with a supposed unicorn horn.

Normal backwardation<====>58467<====>Normal backwardation Normal backwardation, also sometimes called backwardation, is the market condition wherein the price of a commodities' forward or futures contract is trading below the expected spot price at contract maturity.   The resulting futures or forward curve would typically be downward sloping (i. e.  "inverted"), since contracts for further dates would typically trade at even lower prices.   In practice, the expected future spot price is unknown, and the term "backwardation" may be used to refer to "positive basis", which occurs when the current spot price exceeds the price of the future.

Airborne forces<====>58478<====>Airborne forces  Airborne Military parachuting or gliding form of inserting personnel or supplies.  Purpose Delivering personnel, equipment, or supplies.  Origins Attributed to Italian troops on November 1927.    Airborne forces are military units, usually light infantry, set up to be moved by aircraft and "dropped" into battle, typically by parachute.  Thus, they can be placed behind enemy lines, and have the capability to deploy almost anywhere with little warning.  The formations are limited only by the number and size of their aircraft, so given enough capacity a huge force can appear "out of nowhere" in minutes, an action referred to as vertical envelopment.

Grover's algorithm<====>58498<====>Grover's algorithmGrover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm that finds with high probability the unique input to a black box function that produces a particular output value, using just  O(\sqrt{N})  evaluations of the function, where N is the size of the function's domain.  It was devised by Lov Grover in 1996. The analogous problem in classical computation cannot be solved in fewer than  O(N)  evaluations (because, in the worst case, the N-th member of the domain might be the correct member).  At roughly the same time that Grover published his algorithm, Bennett, Bernstein, Brassard, and Vazirani proved that any quantum solution to the problem needs to evaluate the function Ω( \sqrt{N} ) times, so Grover's algorithm is asymptotically optimal.

Hobbit<====>58607<====>HobbitHobbits    are a fictional, diminutive, humanoid race who inhabit the lands of Middle-earth in J.  R.  R.  Tolkien’s fiction.  They are also referred to as Halflings. Hobbits first appeared in the novel The Hobbit, whose titular hobbit is the protagonist Bilbo Baggins.  The novel The Lord of the Rings includes as major characters the hobbits Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, Peregrin Took, and Meriadoc Brandybuck, as well as several other minor hobbit characters.  Hobbits are also briefly mentioned in The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales. According to the author in the prologue to The Lord of the Rings, hobbits are "relatives"  of the race of Men. 

Trusted Computing<====>58608<====>Trusted Computing Trusted Computing (TC) is a technology developed and promoted by the Trusted Computing Group.  Chris Mitchell, Trusted Computing, Institution of Electrical Engineers, 2005.   The term is taken from the field of trusted systems and has a specialized meaning.  With Trusted Computing, the computer will consistently behave in expected ways, and those behaviors will be enforced by computer hardware and software.   Enforcing this behavior is achieved by loading the hardware with a unique encryption key inaccessible to the rest of the system. TC is controversial as the hardware is not only secured for its owner, but also secured against its owner. 

Courthouse<====>58609<====>Courthouse A courthouse (sometimes spelled court house) is a building that is home to a local court of law and often the regional county government as well, although this is not the case in some larger cities.  The term is common in North America.  In most other English-speaking countries, buildings which house courts of law are simply called "courts" or "court buildings".   In most of Continental Europe and former non-English-speaking European colonies, the equivalent term is a palace of justice (French: palais de justice, Italian: palazzo di giustizia, Portuguese: palácio da justiça). United StatesIn most counties in the United States, the local trial courts conduct their business in a centrally located courthouse which may also house county governmental offices. 

Non-Euclidean geometry<====>58610<====>Non-Euclidean geometry In mathematics, non-Euclidean geometry consists of two geometries based on axioms closely related to those specifying Euclidean geometry.  As Euclidean geometry lies at the intersection of metric geometry and affine geometry, non-Euclidean geometry arises when either the metric requirement is relaxed, or the parallel postulate is replaced with an alternative one.  In the latter case one obtains hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry, the traditional non-Euclidean geometries.  When the metric requirement is relaxed, then there are affine planes associated with the planar algebras which give rise to kinematic geometries that have also been called non-Euclidean geometry. 

Fact<====>58617<====>Fact A fact is a statement that is true or can be proven with evidence.  The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability — that is, whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to experience.  Standard reference works are often used to check facts.  Scientific facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement (by experiments or other means). Etymology and usageThe word "fact" derives from the Latin factum, and was first used in English with the same meaning: a thing done or performed, a meaning now obsolete.    The common usage of "something that has really occurred or is the case" dates from the middle of the sixteenth century. 

The Wasp Factory<====>58619<====>The Wasp Factory The Wasp Factory is the first novel by Scottish writer Iain Banks, published in 1984.  Before the publication of The Wasp Factory, Banks had written several science fiction novels that had not been accepted for publication.  Banks decided to try a more mainstream novel in the hopes that it would be more readily accepted, and wrote about a psychopathic teenager living on a remote Scottish island.  According to Banks, this allowed him to treat the story as something resembling science fiction – the island could be envisaged as a planet, and Frank, the protagonist, almost as an alien. 

Espedair Street<====>58620<====>Espedair Street Espedair Street is a novel by Scottish writer Iain Banks, published in 1987. Plot introductionThe book tells the (fictional) story of the rise to fame of Dan Weir ('Weird'), a bass guitar player in a rock and roll band called Frozen Gold, and of his struggles to be happy now that he is rich and famous. Plot summary  Weird starts out in the Ferguslie Park area of Paisley in a very underprivileged Catholic family.  He is impressed by a group named Frozen Gold when he sees them live, in the Union of Paisley College of Technology, and auditions with them. 

The Crow Road<====>58621<====>The Crow Road   The Crow Road is a novel by the Scottish writer Iain Banks, published in 1992.  Plot introductionA pivotal period in Prentice McHoan's life is described, seen through his preoccupations with death, sex, his relationship with his father, unrequited love, sibling rivalry, a missing uncle, relationships, cars, drink (and other intoxicants) and God, with the background a celebration of the Scottish landscape.  Plot summaryThis Bildungsroman is set in the fictional Argyll town of Gallanach (by its description, reminiscent of Oban but on the north east shore of Loch Crinan), the real village of Lochgair, and in Glasgow where the adult Prentice McHoan lives. 

Consider Phlebas<====>58622<====>Consider Phlebas Consider Phlebas, first published in 1987, is a space opera novel by Scottish writer Iain M.  Banks.  Written after a 1984 draft, it is the first to feature the Culture. The novel revolves around the Idiran–Culture War, and Banks plays on that theme by presenting various microcosms of that conflict.  Its protagonist Bora Horza Gobuchul is an enemy of the Culture. Consider Phlebas is Banks's first published science fiction novel set in the Culture, and takes its title from a line in T.  S.  Eliot's poem The Waste Land.  A subsequent Culture novel, Look to Windward (2000), whose title comes from the previous line of the same poem, can be considered a loose follow-up. 

The Culture<====>58623<====>The Culture   The Culture is a fictional interstellar utopian society in which anarchy and socialism are balanced by direct democracy.  The Culture was created by the Scottish writer Iain M.  Banks and features in a number of his space opera novels and works of short fiction, collectively called the Culture series. In the series, the Culture is composed primarily of sentient beings of the pan-human variety, artificially intelligent sentient machines, and a small number of other sentient "alien" life forms.  Machine intelligences range from human-equivalent drones to hyper-intelligent Minds.  The Culture's economy is maintained automatically by its non-sentient machines, with high-level work entrusted to the Minds' subroutines, which allows its humanoid and drone citizens to indulge their passions, romances, hobbies, or other activities, without servitude. 

Polyglotta Africana<====>58624<====>Polyglotta Africana Polyglotta Africana is a study written by the German missionary Sigismund Wilhelm Koelle in 1854 in which he compared 156 African languages (or about 120 according to today's classification; several varieties considered distinct by Koelle were later shown to belong to the same language).  As a comparative study it was a major breakthrough at the time.  Koelle based his material on first hand observations, mostly with freed slaves in Freetown, Sierra Leone.  He transcribed the data using a uniform phonetic script devised by the Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius.  Koelle's transcriptions were not always accurate; for example, he persistently confused   with   and   with  . 

Court-martial<====>58625<====>Court-martialA court-martial (plural courts-martial, as "martial" is postpositive) is a military court.  A court-martial is empowered to determine the guilt of members of the armed forces subject to military law, and, if the defendant is found guilty, to decide upon punishment.  In addition, courts-martial may be used to try prisoners of war for war crimes.  The Geneva Convention requires that POWs who are on trial for war crimes be subject to the same procedures as would be the holding military's own forces. Most navies have a standard court-martial which convenes whenever a ship is lost; this does not presume that the captain is suspected of wrongdoing, but merely that the circumstances surrounding the loss of the ship be made part of the official record. 

Leopold Zunz<====>58629<====>Leopold ZunzLeopold Zunz ( —Yom Tov Tzuntz,  —Lipmann Zunz; 10 August 1794 – 17 March 1886) was the founder of academic Judaic Studies (Wissenschaft des Judentums), the critical investigation of Jewish literature, hymnology and ritual.   Zunz's historical investigations and contemporary writings had an important influence on contemporary Judaism. BiographyLeopold Zunz was born at Detmold, the son of Talmud scholar Immanuel Menachem Zunz (1759-1802) and Hendel Behrens (1773-1809), the daughter of Dov Beer, Glatzer, Nahum N. , and Gregor Pelger (2007).

It drains a very large area, about  ,    that includes parts of southeastern Nunavut, Saskatchewan, Alberta, most of Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and parts of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Montana.  Hudson Bay's southern arm is called James Bay. The Eastern Cree name for Hudson and James Bay is Wînipekw (Southern dialect) or Wînipâkw (Northern dialect), meaning muddy or brackish water. 

Erysipelas<====>58637<====>Erysipelas Erysipelas is an acute infection typically with a skin rash, usually on any of the legs and toes, face, arms, and fingers.   It is an infection of the upper dermis and superficial lymphatics, usually caused by beta-hemolytic group A Streptococcus bacteria on scratches or otherwise infected areas.Erysipelas is more superficial than cellulitis, and is typically more raised and demarcated.The term is from Greek ἐρυσίπελας, meaning "red skin". Signs and symptoms  Affected individuals typically develop symptoms including high fevers, shaking, chills, fatigue, headaches, vomiting, and general illness within 48 hours of the initial infection. 

Group A streptococcal infection<====>58638<====>Group A streptococcal infection A group A streptococcal infection is an infection with group A streptococcus (GAS).  Streptococcus pyogenes comprises the vast majority of the Lancefield group A streptococci, and is often used as a synonym for GAS.  However, S.  dysgalactiae can also be group A.   S.  pyogenes is a beta-hemolytic species of Gram positive bacteria that is responsible for a wide range of both invasive and noninvasive infections.    Infection of GAS may spread through direct contact with mucus or sores on the skin.   GAS infections can cause >500,000 deaths per year. 

Dida language<====>58639<====>Dida language Dida is a dialect cluster of the Kru family spoken in Ivory Coast. Ethnologue divides Dida into two groups, Yocoboué Dida (101,600 speakers in 1993) and Lakota Dida (93,800 speakers in 1993), which are only marginally mutually intelligible and best considered separate languages.  Each is dialectically diverse: Yocoboué (Yokubwe) consists of the Lozoua (Lozwa) and Divo dialects (7,100 and 94,500 speakers), and Lakota the Lakota (Lákota), Abou (Abu), and Vata dialects.  The prestige dialect is the Lozoua speech of the town of Guitry. Yocoboué is also known as Guitry, Yocoboue, Yokouboué, Gakpa, Goudou (Gudu), and Kagoué (Kagwe).

Jerónimo Zurita y Castro<====>58641<====>Jerónimo Zurita y Castro Jerónimo (or Gerónimo) de Zurita y Castro or simply Jerónimo (or Gerónimo) de Zurita (1512 – 3 November 1580) was a Spanish historian of the sixteenth century who founded the modern tradition of historical scholarship in Spain. Born at Zaragoza, Kingdom of Aragon, he studied at Alcalá de Henares under the Hellenist Hernán Nuñez.  Through the influence of his father, Miguel de Zurita, physician to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, he entered the public service as magistrate at Barbastro, and in 1537 was appointed assistant-secretary of the Inquisition.  In 1548 Zurita was nominated official chronicler of the Kingdom of Aragon, and in 1566 Philip II of Spain attached him as secretary to the council of the Inquisition, delegating to him the conduct of all matters sufficiently important to require the king's signature. 

James Bay<====>58642<====>James Bay   James Bay ( ,  ) is a large body of water on the southern end of Hudson Bay in Canada.  Both bodies of water extend from the Arctic Ocean, of which James Bay is the southernmost part.  It borders the provinces of Quebec and Ontario; islands within the bay (the largest of which is Akimiski Island) are part of Nunavut.  The James Bay watershed is the site of several major hydroelectric projects, and is also a destination for river-based recreation.  Several communities are located near or alongside James Bay, including a number of Aboriginal communities such as the Kashechewan First Nation and nine communities affiliated with the Crees of northern Quebec. 

Nazgûl<====>58644<====>Nazgûl   The Nazgûl (from Black Speech nazg, "ring", and gûl, "wraith, spirit", possibly related to gul, "sorcery" or a wordplay on "ghoul" ), also called Ringwraiths, Ring-wraiths, Black Riders, Dark Riders, the Nine Riders, or simply the Nine, are fictional characters in J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium.  They were nine men who succumbed to Sauron's power and attained near-immortality as wraiths, servants bound to the power of the One Ring and completely under the dominion of Sauron.   They are first mentioned in The Lord of the Rings, originally published in 1954–1955. 

Hudson Strait<====>58645<====>Hudson Strait Hudson Strait links the Atlantic Ocean and Labrador Sea to Hudson Bay in Canada.  This strait lies between Baffin Island and Nunavik, with its eastern entrance marked by Cape Chidley in Quebec and Resolution Island off Baffin Island.  The strait is about 750 km long with an average width of 125 km, varying from 70 km at the eastern entrance to 240 km at Deception Bay.  English navigator Sir Martin Frobisher was the first European to report entering the strait, in 1578.  He named a tidal rip at the entrance the Furious Overfall and called the strait Mistaken Strait, since he felt it held less promise as an entrance to the Northwest Passage than the body of water that was later named Frobisher Bay. 

Strait<====>58646<====>Strait   A strait  is a naturally formed, narrow, typically navigable waterway that connects two larger bodies of water.  Most commonly it is a channel of water that lies between two land masses.  Some straits are not navigable, for example because they are too shallow, or because of an unnavigable reef or archipelago. TerminologyThe terms channel, pass or passage, can be synonymous and used interchangeably with strait, although each is sometimes differentiated with varying senses.  In Scotland firth or kyle are also sometimes used as synonyms for strait.   Many straits are economically important. 

Labrador<====>58647<====>Labrador   Labradoris the continental-mainland part of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador.  It comprises the mainland portion of the province, separated from the island of Newfoundland by the Strait of Belle Isle.  It is the largest and northernmost geographical region in Atlantic Canada. Labrador occupies the eastern part of the Labrador Peninsula.  It is bordered to the west and the south by the Canadian province of Quebec.  Labrador also shares a small land border with the Canadian territory of Nunavut on Killiniq Island. Though Labrador covers 71 percent of the province's land area, it has only 8 percent of the province's population. 

Faraday constant<====>58648<====>Faraday constant The Faraday constant, denoted by the symbol   and sometimes stylized as ℱ, is named after Michael Faraday.  In physics and chemistry, this constant represents the magnitude of electric charge per mole of electrons.   It has the currently accepted value    This constant has a simple relation to two other physical constants: F\,=\,eN_{A} where  N A  is the Avogadro constant (the ratio of the number of particles, N, which is unitless, to the amount of substance, n, in units of moles), and e is the elementary charge or the magnitude of the charge of an electron. 

Base unit (measurement)<====>58650<====>Base unit (measurement)  A base unit (also referred to as a fundamental unit) is a unit adopted for measurement of a base quantity.  A base quantity is one of a conventionally chosen subset of physical quantities, where no quantity in the subset can be expressed in terms of the others. In the language of measurement, quantities are quantifiable aspects of the world, such as time, distance, velocity, mass, temperature, energy, and weight, and units are used to describe their magnitude or quantity.  Many of these quantities are related to each other by various physical laws, and as a result the units of a quantities can be generally be expressed as a product of powers of other units; for example, momentum is mass multiplied by velocity, while velocity is measured in distance divided by time. 

List of kingdoms and royal dynasties<====>58653<====>List of kingdoms and royal dynasties Monarchism is a movement that supports the monarchy as a form of government.  Ancient kingdoms and royal dynastiesA monarch is the person at the head of a monarchy.  This is a form of government in which a Sovereign state or country is ruled or controlled by an individual who typically inherits the throne by birth and rules for life or until abdication.  Monarchs may be autocrats (absolute monarchy) or ceremonial heads of state who exercise the power, with actual authority vested in a parliament or other body (constitutional monarchy). Monarchism is a system based on the belief that political power should be concentrated in one person who rules by decree. 

Monarchianism<====>58655<====>MonarchianismMonarchianism is a set of beliefs that emphasize God as being one person, Encyclopædia Britannica: Monarchianism  Monarchians at Catholic Encyclopedia, newadvent. org   in direct contrast to Trinitarianism which defines God as three persons coexisting consubstantially as one in being.  HistoryVarious models of resolving the relationship between God the Father and the Son of God were proposed in the 2nd century, but later rejected in favor of the doctrine of the Trinity as expounded at the First Council of Constantinople, which confirmed the concept of God as one being consisting of three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. 

Honeywell 6000 series<====>58658<====>Honeywell 6000 series The Honeywell 6000 series computers were rebadged versions of General Electric's 600-series mainframes manufactured by Honeywell International, Inc.  from 1970 to 1989.   Honeywell acquired the line when it purchased GE's computer division in 1970 and continued to develop them under a variety of names for many years. The high-end model was the 6080, with performance approximately 1 MIPS.   Smaller models were the 6070,  6060, 6050, 6040, and 6030.  In 1973 a low-end 6025 was introduced.   The even-numbered models included an Enhanced Instruction Set feature (EIS), which added decimal arithmetic and storage-to-storage operations to the original word-oriented architecture. 

GE-600 series<====>58659<====>GE-600 series The GE-600 series was a family of 36-bit mainframe computers originating in the 1960s, built by General Electric (GE).  When GE left the mainframe business the line was sold to Honeywell, which built similar systems into the 1990s as the division moved to Groupe Bull and then NEC. ArchitectureThe 600 series used 36-bit words and 18-bit addresses.  They had two 36-bit accumulators, eight 18-bit index registers, and one 8-bit exponent register.  It supported floating point in both 36-bit single-precision and 2 x 36-bit double precision, the exponent being stored separately, allowing up to 71 bits of precision (one bit being used for the sign). 

401 BC<====>58660<====>401 BC    Year 401 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time, it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Potitus, Cossus, Camillus, Ambustus, Mamercinus and Iullus (or, less frequently, year 353 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 401 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

CDC 6600<====>58661<====>CDC 6600The CDC 6600 was the flagship of the 6000 series of mainframe computer systems manufactured by Control Data Corporation. Generally considered to be the first successful supercomputer, it outperformed the industry's prior recordholder, the IBM 7030 Stretch, by a factor of three.  "Designed by Seymour Cray, the CDC 6600 was almost three times faster than the next fastest machine of its day, the IBM 7030 Stretch. "With performance of up to three megaFLOPS,   the CDC 6600 was the world's fastest computer from 1964 to 1969, when it relinquished that status to its successor, the CDC 7600. 

Gas turbine<====>58664<====>Gas turbine A gas turbine, also called a combustion turbine, is a type of continuous combustion, internal combustion engine.  There are three main components:  An upstream rotating gas compressor;  A downstream turbine on the same shaft; A combustion chamber or area, called a combustor, in between 1.  and 2.  above.  A fourth component is often used to increase efficiency (turboprop, turbofan), to convert power into mechanical or electric form (turboshaft, electric generator), or to achieve greater power to mass/volume ratio (afterburner). The basic operation of the gas turbine is a Brayton cycle with air as the working fluid. 

Inversions (novel)<====>58665<====>Inversions (novel) Inversions is a science fiction novel by Scottish writer Iain M.  Banks, first published in 1998.  Banks has said "Inversions was an attempt to write a Culture novel that wasn't. " PlotThe book takes place on a fictional planet resembling late-Middle Ages Europe.  A large empire broke up in the decade or so preceding the action, apparently from meteor or asteroid strikes that severely affected farming across much of the globe.  The remnants of the empire still war with one another. The narrative alternates chapter-by-chapter between two concurrent story-lines, with alternating chapter headings of The Doctor and The Bodyguard.

Tripropellant rocket<====>58671<====>Tripropellant rocket  A tripropellant rocket is a rocket that uses three propellants, as opposed to the more common bipropellant rocket or monopropellant rocket designs, which use two or one fuels, respectively.  Tripropellant rockets appear to offer fairly impressive gains for single stage to orbit designs, although to date no tripropellant rocket design has been developed to the point of testing that would prove the concept. Simultaneous burnThere are two principally different kinds of tripropellant rockets.   One is a rocket engine which mixes three separate streams of propellants.  In the 1960s, Rocketdyne fired an engine using a mixture of liquid lithium, gaseous hydrogen, and liquid fluorine to produce a specific impulse of 542 seconds, likely the highest measured such value for a chemical rocket motor. 

Sola scriptura<====>58672<====>Sola scriptura    Sola scriptura (Latin: by Scripture alone) is a Christian theological doctrine which holds that the Christian Scriptures are the sole infallible rule of faith and practice. The Scriptures' meaning is mediated through many kinds of secondary authority, such as the ordinary teaching offices of the Church, the ecumenical creeds, the councils of the Christian Church, and so on.  However, sola scriptura rejects any original infallible authority other than the Bible.  In this view, all secondary authority is derived from the authority of the Scriptures and is therefore subject to reform when compared to the teaching of the Bible. 

Liquid hydrogen<====>58673<====>Liquid hydrogen Liquid hydrogen (LH2 or LH 2 ) is the liquid state of the element hydrogen.  Hydrogen is found naturally in the molecular H 2  form. To exist as a liquid, H 2  must be cooled below hydrogen's critical point of 33 K.  However, for hydrogen to be in a fully liquid state without boiling at atmospheric pressure, it needs to be cooled to 20. 28 K IPTS-1968, iupac. org, accessed 2009-06-12  (−423. 17 °F/−252. 87 °C).    One common method of obtaining liquid hydrogen involves a compressor resembling a jet engine in both appearance and principle. 

Sola fide<====>58674<====>Sola fide   Sola fide (Latin: by faith alone), also known as justification by faith alone, is a Christian theological doctrine that distinguishes the Lutheran and Reformed branches of Protestant Christianity, as well as some other denominations, from the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and some parts of the Restoration Movement, as well as the Methodist Churches. The doctrine of sola fide asserts God's pardon for guilty sinners is granted to and received through faith alone, excluding all "works".   All mankind, it is asserted, is fallen and sinful, under the curse of God, and incapable of saving itself from God's wrath and curse. 

Chicago Boys<====>58679<====>Chicago Boys The Chicago Boys were a group of Chilean economists prominent around the 1970s and 1980s, the majority of whom trained at the Department of Economics of the University of Chicago under Milton Friedman and Arnold Harberger, or at its affiliate in the economics department at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.  Upon their return to Latin America they adopted positions in numerous South American governments as economic advisors, many of them reaching high positions.   The Heritage Foundation credits them with transforming Chile into Latin America's best performing economy and one of the world's most business-friendly jurisdictions.

Bookmaker (gambling)<====>58683<====>Bookmaker (gambling) A bookmaker, bookie, or turf accountant is an organization or a person that accepts and pays off bets on sporting and other events at agreed-upon odds. HistoryThe first bookmaker, Ogden, stood at Newmarket in 1795.Range of eventsBookmakers in many countries focus on accepting bets on professional sports, especially horse racing and association football (soccer).  However, a wider range of bets, including on political elections, awards ceremonies such as the Oscars, and novelty bets are accepted by bookmakers in more and more countries. Operational procedures By "adjusting the odds" in their favour (paying out amounts using odds that are less than what they determined to be the true odds) or by having a point spread, bookmakers aim to guarantee a profit by achieving a 'balanced book', either by getting an equal number of bets for each possible outcome or (when they are offering odds) by getting the amounts wagered on each outcome to reflect the odds.

Hypothalamus<====>58685<====>Hypothalamus The hypothalamus (from Greek ὑπό, "under" and θάλαμος, thalamus) is a portion of the brain that contains a number of small nuclei with a variety of functions.  One of the most important functions of the hypothalamus is to link the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland (hypophysis). The hypothalamus is located below the thalamus and is part of the limbic system.    In the terminology of neuroanatomy, it forms the ventral part of the diencephalon.   All vertebrate brains contain a hypothalamus.  In humans, it is the size of an almond. 

Cerebral cortex<====>58686<====>Cerebral cortex  The cerebral cortex is the largest region of the cerebrum in the mammalian brain and plays a key role in memory, attention, perception, cognition, awareness, thought, language, and consciousness. The cerebral cortex is the most anterior (rostral) brain region and consists of an outer zone of neural tissue called gray matter, which contains neuronal cell bodies.   It is also divided into left and right cerebral hemispheres by the longitudinal fissure, but the two hemispheres are joined at the midline by the corpus callosum.  At the cellular and circuit level, the cerebral cortex is characterized by two primary organizational features:across its surface it is divided into functional areas that serve various sensory, motor, and cognitive functions, andit is subdivided into several layers that organize the input and output connectivity of resident neurons. 

Aggression<====>58687<====>Aggression  Aggression is overt, often harmful, social interaction with the intention of inflicting damage or other unpleasantness upon another individual.  It may occur either in retaliation or without provocation.  In humans, frustration due to blocked goals can cause aggression.  Human aggression can be classified into direct and indirect aggression, whilst the first is characterized by physical or verbal behavior intended to cause harm to someone, the second one is characterized by a behavior intended to harm social relations of an individual or a group.  In definitions commonly used in the social sciences and behavioral sciences, aggression is a response by an individual that delivers something unpleasant to another person.

Heike Kamerlingh Onnes<====>58761<====>Heike Kamerlingh Onnes  Prof Heike Kamerlingh Onnes FRSFor HFRSE FCS ( ( ); 21 September 1853 – 21 February 1926) was a Dutch physicist and Nobel laureate.  He exploited the Hampson–Linde cycle to investigate how materials behave when cooled to nearly absolute zero and later to liquefy helium for the first time.  Kamerlingh Onnes was significantly influenced by the pioneering molecular theory of Johannes Diderik van der Waals.  In 1908, he became the winner of the race to make liquid helium and because of this, he was also the discoverer of superconductivity in 1911: for certain materials, electrical resistance abruptly vanishes at very low temperatures.

Aleixandre received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1977 "for a creative poetic writing which illuminates man's condition in the cosmos and in present-day society, at the same time representing the great renewal of the traditions of Spanish poetry between the wars".   He was part of the Generation of '27. Aleixandre's early poetry, which he wrote mostly in free verse, is highly surrealistic.  It also praises the beauty of nature by using symbols that represent the earth and the sea.

James Bowman Lindsay<====>58789<====>James Bowman Lindsay  James Bowman Lindsay (8 September 1799 – 29 June 1862) was a Scottish inventor and author.   He is credited with early developments in several fields, such as incandescent lighting and telegraphy. Life and workJames Bowman Lindsay was born in Cotton of West Hills, Carmyllie near Arbroath in Angus, Scotland, son of John Lindsay, farm worker, and Elizabeth Bowman.   During his childhood he was  trained as a handloom weaver.  However at the same time he educated himself and his parents recognised their son's potential.  As a result, they saved enough money to be able to send him to  St. 

Fraud<====>58790<====>Fraud  In law, fraud is deliberate deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain, or to deprive a victim of a legal right.  Fraud itself can be a civil wrong (i. e. , a fraud victim may sue the fraud perpetrator to avoid the fraud or recover monetary compensation), a criminal wrong (i. e. , a fraud perpetrator may be prosecuted and imprisoned by governmental authorities) or it may cause no loss of money, property or legal right but still be an element of another civil or criminal wrong.   The purpose of fraud may be monetary gain or other benefits, such as obtaining a passport or travel document, driver's license or qualifying for a mortgage by way of false statements. 

Taiwanese Hokkien<====>58791<====>Taiwanese Hokkien Taiwanese Hokkien ( ;   ; translated as Taiwanese Min Nan), also known as Taiwanese/Taiwanese Language in Taiwan (  /  ), is a branched-off variant of Hokkien spoken natively by about 70% of the population of Taiwan.   It is spoken by the Taiwanese Hoklo people, who descended from immigrants from southern Fujian during the Qing dynasty.   The Pe̍h-ōe-jī (POJ) romanization is a popular orthography for this variant of Hokkien. Taiwanese Hokkien is generally similar to the speeches of Amoy, Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, as well as their dialectal forms used in Southeast Asia, but with enough differences in vocabulary and pronunciation to make their speakers somewhat mutually unintelligible. 

Judicial discretion<====>58792<====>Judicial discretionJudicial discretion is the power of the judiciary to make some legal decisions according to their discretion.  Under the doctrine of the separation of powers, the ability of judges to exercise discretion is an aspect of judicial independence.  Where appropriate, judicial discretion allows  a judge to decide a legal case or matter within a range of possible decisions. However, where the exercise of discretion goes beyond constraints set down by legislation, by binding precedent, or by a constitution, the court may be abusing its discretion and undermining the rule of law.   In that case, the decision of the court may be ultra vires, and may sometimes be characterized as judicial activism. 

Molasses<====>58794<====>Molasses  Molasses, or black treacle (British, for human consumption; known as molasses otherwise), is a viscous product resulting from refining sugarcane or sugar beets into sugar.  Molasses varies by amount of sugar, method of extraction, and age of plant.  Sugarcane molasses is agreeable in taste and aroma, and is primarily used for sweetening and flavoring foods in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere, while sugar beet molasses is foul-smelling and unpalatable, so it is mainly (mostly) used as an animal feed additive in Europe and Russia, where it is chiefly produced.   Molasses is a defining component of fine commercial brown sugar. 

The Day the Music Died<====>58796<====>The Day the Music Died    On February 3, 1959, rock and roll musicians Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and J.  P.  "The Big Bopper" Richardson were killed in a plane crash near Clear Lake, Iowa, together with pilot Roger Peterson.  The event later became known as "The Day the Music Died", after singer-songwriter Don McLean referred to it as such in his 1971 song "American Pie". At the time, Holly and his band, consisting of Waylon Jennings, Tommy Allsup, and Carl Bunch, were playing on the "Winter Dance Party" tour across the United States Midwest. 

Austronesian languages<====>58800<====>Austronesian languages   The Austronesian languages are a language family that is widely dispersed throughout Maritime Southeast Asia, Madagascar and the islands of the Pacific Ocean, with a few members in continental Asia.   Austronesian languages are spoken by about 386 million people (4. 9%), making it the fourth-largest language family by number of speakers, behind the Indo-European languages (46. 3%), the Sino-Tibetan languages (20. 4%), and the Niger-Congo languages (6. 9%).  Major Austronesian languages with the highest number of speakers are Malay (Indonesian and Malaysian), Javanese, and Filipino (Tagalog).  The family contains 1,257 languages, which is the second most of any language family.

Malayo-Polynesian languages<====>58805<====>Malayo-Polynesian languages The Malayo-Polynesian languages are a subgroup of the Austronesian languages, with approximately 385. 5 million speakers.  The Malayo-Polynesian languages are spoken by the Austronesian people of the island nations of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean, with a smaller number in continental Asia.  Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam serve as the northwest geographic outlier, going well into the Malay peninsula.  On the northernmost geographical outlier does not pass beyond the north of Pattani, which is located in southern Thailand.  Malagasy is spoken in the island of Madagascar located off the eastern coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean. 

New York divorce law<====>58806<====>New York divorce lawNew York divorce law changed on August 15, 2010, when Governor David Paterson signed no-fault divorce into law in New York state.  Until 2010, New York recognized divorces only upon fault-based criteria or upon separation.  The State Senate had approved the No-Fault Divorce bill on June 30, and the State Assembly passed the bill on July 1. OverviewDespite being generally considered a liberal state, New York has a history of being conservative on issues regarding marriage; it was the last state in the country to allow no-fault divorce and still maintains a (seldom enforced) law against adultery (Penal Law § 255. 

Adultery<====>58809<====>Adultery    Adultery (from Latin adulterium) is extramarital sex that is considered objectionable on social, religious, moral, or legal grounds.  Though what sexual activities constitute adultery varies, as well as the social, religious, and legal consequences, the concept exists in many cultures and is similar in Christianity, Islam, and Judaism.   A single act of sexual intercourse is generally sufficient to constitute adultery, and a more long-term sexual relationship is sometimes referred to as an affair. Historically, many cultures have considered adultery to be a very serious crime.  Adultery often incurred severe punishment, usually for the woman and sometimes for the man, with penalties including capital punishment, mutilation, or torture. 

Gaius Marcius Coriolanus<====>58810<====>Gaius Marcius CoriolanusGaius Marcius (Caius Martius) Coriolanus ( ) was a Roman general who is said to have lived in the 5th century BC.  He received his toponymic cognomen "Coriolanus" because of his exceptional valor in a Roman siege of the Volscian city of Corioli.  He was subsequently exiled from Rome, and led troops of Rome's enemy the Volsci to besiege Rome. In later ancient times, it was generally accepted by historians that Coriolanus was a real historical individual, and a consensus narrative story of his life appeared, retold by leading historians such as Livy, Plutarch, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus. 

Eragrostis tef<====>58811<====>Eragrostis tef Eragrostis tef, also known as teff, Williams' lovegrass or annual bunch grass, is an annual grass, a species of lovegrass native to Ethiopia and Eritrea.    It is raised for its edible seeds, also known as teff. It is also occasionally known by the native names taf (  ṭaff;   ṭēff) and xaafii (Oromo). DescriptionTeff has an attractive nutrition profile, being high in dietary fiber and iron and providing protein and calcium.It is similar to millet and quinoa in cooking, but the seed is much smaller and cooks faster, thus using less fuel. 

Zula<====>58814<====>Zula  Zula ( ,  ) is a small town in central Eritrea.  It is situated near the head of Annesley Bay (also known as the Bay of Zula), on the Red Sea coast.   Four kilometers away is the archeological site of Adulis, which was an emporium and the port of Axum. HistoryThe Kingdom of Aksum was a trading empire centered in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia.  It existed from approximately 100–940 AD, growing from the proto-Aksumite Iron Age period c.  4th century BC to achieve prominence by the 1st century AD. An important trade route led from Adulis, then on the coast, to the capital of the kingdom, Aksum, located in what is now the Tigray Region of Ethiopia. 

Lake Zug<====>58816<====>Lake Zug Lake Zug ( ) is a lake in Central Switzerland, situated between Lake Lucerne and Lake Zurich.  It stretches for 14 km between Arth and the Cham-Zug bay.  The Lorze as the main feeder river empties its waters into the lake at its northern extremity, but 1 km (0. 6 mi) further west issues from the lake to pursue its course towards the Reuss.  Due to this poor feeding, Environmental protection is very important as the lake would suffer long term damage if polluted as the second of the rivers, Rigiaa, feeds only a marginal amount into the lake at its southern end. 

Zug<====>58818<====>Zug   Zug (  ,   ;   ;    ;    ;  Neo-Latin Tugium named in the 16th century ), is an affluent municipality and town in Switzerland.  The name Zug originates from fishing vocabulary; in the Middle Ages it referred to the right to pull up fishing nets and hence to the right to fish. The town of Zug is located in the canton of Zug and is the canton's capital.  As of   it had a total population of   inhabitants.  The official language of Zug is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.

Taddeo Zuccari<====>58821<====>Taddeo ZuccariTaddeo Zuccari (or Zuccaro) (1 September 1529 2 September 1566) was an Italian painter, one of the most popular members of the Roman mannerist school. BiographyZuccari was born in Sant'Angelo in Vado, near Urbino, the son of Ottaviano Zuccari, an almost unknown painter.  His brother Federico, born around 1540, was also a painter and architect.  As a young man Taddeo was to be encouraged by Pompeo da Fano.  Zuccari moved to Rome by age 14, and he succeeded at an early age in gaining a knowledge of painting and in finding patrons to employ him.  When he was seventeen a pupil of Correggio, named Daniele da Parma, engaged him to assist in painting a series of frescoes in a chapel at Vitto near Sora, on the borders of the Abruzzi (not corroborated by Freedberg). 

Federico Zuccari<====>58822<====>Federico Zuccari Federico Zuccari, also known as Federico Zuccaro (c.  1540/1541 August 6, Liana De Girolami Cheney.  "Zuccaro. " Grove Art Online.  Oxford Art Online.  Oxford University Press.  Web.  18 Jul.  2013.    1609), was an Italian Mannerist painter and architect, active both in Italy and abroad. BiographyZuccari was born at Sant'Angelo in Vado, near Urbino (Marche). His documented career as a painter began in 1550, when he moved to Rome to work under Taddeo, his elder brother.  He went on to complete decorations for Pius IV, and help complete the fresco decorations at the Villa Farnese at Caprarola. 

Francesco Zuccarelli<====>58823<====>Francesco Zuccarelli Giacomo Francesco Zuccarelli (commonly known as Francesco Zuccarelli,  , 15 August 1702 – 30 December 1788) RA, was an Italian artist of the late Baroque or Rococo period.   He is considered to be the most important landscape painter to have emerged from his adopted city of Venice during the mid-eighteenth century,  and his Arcadian views became popular throughout Europe and especially in England where he resided for two extended periods.   His patronage extended to the nobility, and he often collaborated with other artists such as Antonio Visentini and Bernardo Bellotto.  In 1768, Zuccarelli became a founding member of the Royal Academy of Arts, and upon his final return to Italy, he was elected president of the Venetian Academy. 

Corporate raid<====>58824<====>Corporate raid In business, a corporate raid is the process of buying a large stake in a corporation and then using shareholder voting rights to require the company to undertake novel measures designed to increase the share value, generally in opposition to the desires and practices of the corporation's current management.  The measures might include replacing top executives, downsizing operations, or liquidating the company. Corporate raids were particularly common in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s in the United States.  By the end of the 1980s, management of many large publicly traded corporations had adopted legal countermeasures designed to thwart potential hostile takeovers and corporate raids, including poison pills, golden parachutes, and increases in debt levels on the company's balance sheet. 

Zschopau<====>58825<====>Zschopau  Zschopau ( ), is a town in the Erzgebirgskreis district of Saxony, Germany. GeographyThe town is located on the northwestern slopes of the Ore Mountains, on both banks of the Zschopau River, about   south-east from Chemnitz.  The highest point is Mt.  Pilzhübel with an elevation of  .  The municipal area comprises the village of Krumhermersdorf, incorporated in 1999.  Since German reunification, Zschopau has lost about one fourth of its population. Zschopau is famous for its motorcycle industry, particularly the DKW and MZ Motorrad- und Zweiradwerk GmbH brands, and the toy business VEB Plasticart. 

Heinrich Zschokke<====>58827<====>Heinrich Zschokke Johann Heinrich Daniel Zschokke (22 March 1771 27 June 1848) was a German, later Swiss, author and reformer.   Most of his life was spent, and most of his reputation earned, in Switzerland.   He had an extensive civil service career, and wrote histories, fiction and other works which were widely known. BiographyYouth and early career in PrussiaBorn in Magdeburg, Prussia, he was educated at the monasterial (Kloster) school and at the Altstädter Gymnasium there.  He ran away from school at 17,    and spent some time as playwright with a company of strolling actors. 

Market capitalization<====>58829<====>Market capitalization Market capitalization (market cap) is the market value at a point in time of the shares outstanding of a publicly traded company, being equal to the share price at that point of time times the number of shares outstanding. As outstanding stock is bought and sold in public markets, capitalization could be used as an indicator of public opinion of a company's net worth and is a determining factor in some forms of stock valuation. Market capitalization is used by the investment community in ranking the size of companies, as opposed to sales or total asset figures. 

Leveraged buyout<====>58834<====>Leveraged buyout A leveraged buyout (LBO) is a financial transaction in which a company is purchased with a combination of equity and debt, such that the company's cash flow is the collateral used to secure and repay the borrowed money.  The use of debt, which has a lower cost of capital than equity, serves to reduce the overall cost of financing the acquisition.  The cost of debt is lower because interest payments reduce corporate income tax liability, whereas dividend payments do not. This reduced cost of financing allows greater gains to accrue to the equity, and, as a result, the debt serves as a lever to increase the returns to the equity. 

Zoutpansberg<====>58837<====>Zoutpansberg  Zoutpansberg was the north-eastern division of the Transvaal, South Africa.  This was the district to which Louis Tregardt and Hans van Rensburg, the forerunners of the Great Trek, journeyed in 1835.  In 1845 Hendrik Potgieter, a prominent leader of the Voortrekkers, moved there.  The Zoutpansberg Boers formed a semi-independent community, and in 1857 Stephanus Schoeman, their commandant-general, sided against Marthinus Pretorius and Paul Kruger when they invaded the Orange Free State.  It was not until 1864 that Zoutpansberg was definitely incorporated in the South African Republic as a result of the Transvaal Civil War. 

Default (finance)<====>58838<====>Default (finance) In finance, default is failure to meet the legal obligations (or conditions) of a loan,  for example when a home buyer fails to make a mortgage payment, or when a corporation or government fails to pay a bond which has reached maturity.  A national or sovereign default is the failure or refusal of a government to repay its national debt. The biggest private default in history is Lehman Brothers with over $600,000,000,000 when it filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and the biggest sovereign default is Greece with $138,000,000,000 in March 2012.  Distinction from insolvency, illiquidity and bankruptcyThe term default should be distinguished from the terms insolvency and bankruptcy:"Default": a debtor has passed the payment deadline on a debt they were due to pay.

Richard Zouch<====>58842<====>Richard Zouch  Richard Zouch also Richard Zouche (  1 March 1661) was an English judge and member of parliament from 1621 to 1624. LifeZouch was born at Ansty, Wiltshire, son of Francis Zouche.  His mother is said to have been Philippa, sixth daughter of George Ludlow of Hill Deverel, Wiltshire.  He was educated at Winchester and afterwards at New College, Oxford, where he was a scholar in 1607, and Fellow in 1609.He graduated as B. C. L.  in 1614, and D. C. L.  in 1619, was admitted at Doctor's Commons in January 1618, and was appointed Regius Professor of Civil Law at Oxford in 1620. 

Zouave<====>58843<====>Zouave The Zouaves ( ) were a class of light infantry regiments of the French Army serving between 1830 and 1962 and linked to French North Africa, as well as some units of other countries modelled upon them.  The zouaves, along with the indigenous Tirailleurs Algeriens, were among the most decorated units of the French Army. It was initially intended in 1830 that the zouaves be a regiment of Berber volunteers from the Zwawa group of tribes in Algeria—thus the French term  —who had gained a martial reputation fighting for local rulers under the Ottoman Empire.  The regiment was to consist of sixteen hundred Zwawa Berbers, French NCOs and French officers. 

Zosterops<====>58845<====>Zosterops  Zosterops (meaning "eye-girdle"   ) is a genus of birds containing the typical white-eyes.  They are traditionally placed in the white-eye family, Zosteropidae, which, however, is now considered part of the Timaliidae.   This genus has the highest number of species among the white-eyes by far.  They occur in the Afrotropic ecoregion, the Indomalaya zone, and the Australasia ecozone.  Typical white-eyes can reach a length between 8 and 15 cm.  Their most characteristic feature is the conspicuous white feather ring around the eye, though some species lack it.  The species in this group vary in the structural adaptations of the tongue. 

Regions of France<====>58846<====>Regions of FranceFrance is divided into 18 administrative regions ( ,  ), including 13 metropolitan regions and 5 overseas regions.The 13 metropolitan regions (including 12 mainland regions and Corsica) are each further subdivided into 2 to 13 departments, while the overseas regions consist of only one department each and hence are also referred to as "overseas departments".  The current legal concept of region was adopted in 1982, and in 2016 what had been 27 regions was reduced to 18. History The term région was officially created by the Law of Decentralisation (2 March 1982), which also gave regions their legal status. 

Fiona Apple<====>58848<====>Fiona Apple   Fiona Apple McAfee-Maggart (born September 13, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter, pianist, and poet.  Classically trained on piano as a child, Apple began composing her own songs when she was 8 years old.   Her debut album, Tidal, written when Apple was 17, was released in 1996 and received a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the single "Criminal".   She followed with When the Pawn. . .  (1999), produced by Jon Brion, which was also critically and commercially successful and was certified platinum. For her third album, Extraordinary Machine (2005), Apple again collaborated with Brion, and began recording the album in 2002. 

Gender studies<====>58849<====>Gender studies  Gender studies is a field for interdisciplinary study devoted to gender identity and gendered representation as central categories of analysis.  This field includes women's studies (concerning women, feminism, gender, and politics), men's studies and queer studies.Sometimes, gender studies is offered together with study of sexuality. These disciplines study gender and sexuality in the fields of literature, language, geography, history, political science, sociology, anthropology, cinema, media studies,  human development, law, and medicine.It also analyzes how race, ethnicity, location, class, nationality, and disability intersect with the categories of gender and sexuality. 

Joseph Bonanno<====>58855<====>Joseph Bonanno   Joseph Charles Bonanno Sr.  ( ; January 18, 1905 – May 11, 2002) was an Italian-born American mafioso who became the boss of the Bonanno crime family. Early lifeGiuseppe Carlo Bonanno was born on January 18, 1905 in Castellammare del Golfo, a town on the northwestern coast of Sicily.   When he was three years old, his family moved to the United States and settled in the Williamsburg neighborhood in Brooklyn for about 10 years before returning to Italy.  Bonanno slipped back into the United States in 1924 by stowing away on a Cuban fishing boat bound for Tampa, Florida. 

Gymnosporangium<====>58857<====>Gymnosporangium  Gymnosporangium is a genus of heteroecious plant-pathogenic fungi which alternately infect members of the family Cupressaceae, primarily species in the genus Juniperus (junipers), and members of the family Rosaceae in the subfamily Maloideae (apples, pears, quinces, shadbush, hawthorns, rowans and their relatives).  According to the Dictionary of the Fungi (10th edition, 2008), there are about 57 species in the genus.  In junipers (the primary hosts) (see photo), some species of the fungus form  a ball like gall about 2–4 cm in diameter which produces a set of orange tentacle-like spore tubes called telial horns.  These horns expand and have a jelly like consistency when wet. 

Regions of New Zealand<====>58858<====>Regions of New Zealand  New Zealand is divided into sixteen regions ( ) for local government purposes.  Eleven are administered by regional councils (the top tier of local government), and five are administered by unitary authorities, which are territorial authorities (the second tier of local government) that also perform the functions of regional councils.    The Chatham Islands Council is similar to a unitary authority, authorised under its own legislation.  Current regionsHistory and statutory basisThe regional councils are listed in Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Local Government Act 2002, along with reference to the Gazette notices that established them in 1989. 

Allergen<====>58859<====>Allergen  An allergen is a type of antigen that produces an abnormally vigorous immune response in which the immune system fights off a perceived threat that would otherwise be harmless to the body.  Such reactions are called allergies. In technical terms, an allergen is an antigen capable of stimulating a type-I hypersensitivity reaction in atopic individuals through Immunoglobulin E (IgE) responses.   Most humans mount significant Immunoglobulin E responses only as a defense against parasitic infections.  However, some individuals may respond to many common environmental antigens.  This hereditary predisposition is called atopy.  In atopic individuals, non-parasitic antigens stimulate inappropriate IgE production, leading to type I hypersensitivity. 

Three utilities problem<====>58862<====>Three utilities problem The classical mathematical puzzle known as the three utilities problem; the three cottages problem or sometimes water, gas and electricity can be stated as follows: The problem is an abstract mathematical puzzle which imposes constraints that would not exist in a practical engineering situation. It is part of the mathematical field of topological graph theory which studies the embedding of graphs on surfaces.  In more formal graph-theoretic terms, the problem asks whether the complete bipartite graph K 3,3  is planar.   .  Bóna introduces the puzzle (in the form of three houses to be connected to three wells) on p. 

Gödel's incompleteness theorems<====>58863<====>Gödel's incompleteness theorems Gödel's incompleteness theorems are two theorems of mathematical logic that demonstrate the inherent limitations of every formal axiomatic system containing basic arithmetic.   These results, published by Kurt Gödel in 1931, are important both in mathematical logic and in the philosophy of mathematics.  The theorems are widely, but not universally, interpreted as showing that Hilbert's program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics is impossible. The first incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure (i. e. , an algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of the natural numbers. 

Wall Street (1987 film)<====>58865<====>Wall Street (1987 film)    Wall Street is a 1987 American drama film, directed and co-written by Oliver Stone, which stars Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen, and Daryl Hannah.  The film tells the story of Bud Fox (Sheen), a young stockbroker who becomes involved with Gordon Gekko (Douglas), a wealthy, unscrupulous corporate raider. Stone made the film as a tribute to his father, Lou Stone, a stockbroker during the Great Depression.  The character of Gekko is said to be a composite of several people, including Dennis Levine, Ivan Boesky, Carl Icahn, Asher Edelman, Michael Milken, and Stone himself. 

José Zorrilla<====>58869<====>José Zorrilla   José Zorrilla y Moral ( ; 21 February 1817 23 January 1893) was a Spanish Romantic poet and dramatist. BiographyZorrilla was born in Valladolid to a magistrate in whom Ferdinand VII placed special confidence.  He was educated by the Jesuits at the Real Seminario de Nobles in Madrid, wrote verses when he was twelve, became an enthusiastic admirer of Walter Scott and Chateaubriand, and took part in the school performances of plays by Lope de Vega and Calderón de la Barca.    In 1833 he was sent to study law at the University of Toledo, but after a year of idleness, he fled to Madrid, where he horrified the friends of his absolutist father by making violent speeches and by founding a newspaper which was promptly suppressed by the government. 

Sarbinowo, Gmina Dębno<====>58874<====>Sarbinowo, Gmina Dębno  Sarbinowo   ( ) is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Dębno, within Myślibórz County, West Pomeranian Voivodeship, in north-western Poland.It lies approximately   south of Dębno,   south-west of Myślibórz, and   south of the regional capital Szczecin.  The village has a population of 490. Originally a West Slavic settlement, the village was first mentioned in 1261 as Torbarmstorp, a possession of the Knights Templar.  By 1335 it was known as Tzorbensdorf in the Neumark region of the Margraviate of Brandenburg.  In 1540 it fell to John, Margrave of Brandenburg-Küstrin. 

Maclura pomifera<====>58875<====>Maclura pomifera   Maclura pomifera, commonly known as the Osage orange, is a small deciduous tree or large shrub, typically growing to   tall.  The distinctive fruit, from a multiple fruit family, is roughly spherical, bumpy,   in diameter, and turns a bright yellow-green in the fall.  The fruits secrete a sticky white latex when cut or damaged.  Despite the name "Osage orange",    it is only distantly related to the orange,    but rather is a member of the mulberry family, Moraceae.Due to its latex secretions and woody pulp, the fruit is typically not eaten by humans and rarely by foraging animals, giving it distinction as an anachronistic "ghost of evolution". 

Sugar substitute<====>58880<====>Sugar substitute A sugar substitute is a food additive that provides a sweet taste like that of sugar while containing significantly less food energy.  Some sugar substitutes are produced by nature, and others produced synthetically.  Those that are not produced by nature are, in general, called artificial sweeteners.  In 2017, sucralose was the most common sugar substitute used in manufacturing of foods and beverages, having 30% of the global market projected to become $2. 8 billion in collective value by 2021.    Types A class of sugar substitutes is known as high-intensity sweeteners.  These are compounds with many times the sweetness of sucrose, common table sugar. 

Stratford-upon-Avon<====>58882<====>Stratford-upon-Avon    Stratford-upon-Avon ( ) is a market town and civil parish in Warwickshire, England, on the River Avon,   north west of London,   south east of Birmingham, and   south west of Warwick.   The estimated population in 2007 was 25,505,  increasing to 27,445 at the 2011 Census. Stratford was originally inhabited by Anglo-Saxons and remained a village before the lord of the manor, John of Coutances, set out plans to develop it into a town in 1196.  In that same year, Stratford was granted a charter from King Richard I to hold a weekly market in the town, giving it its status as a market town. 

Cedrus<====>58883<====>Cedrus  Cedrus (common English name cedar) is a genus of coniferous trees in the plant family Pinaceae (subfamily Abietoideae).   They are native to the mountains of the western Himalayas and the Mediterranean region, occurring at altitudes of 1,500–3,200 m in the Himalayas and 1,000–2,200 m in the Mediterranean.  Farjon, A.  (1990).  Pinaceae.  Drawings and Descriptions of the Genera.  Koeltz Scientific Books  .  DescriptionCedrus trees can grow up to 30–40 m (occasionally 60 m) tall with spicy-resinous scented wood, thick ridged or square-cracked bark, and broad, level branches.   The shoots are dimorphic, with long shoots, which form the framework of the branches, and short shoots, which carry most of the leaves. 

260 BC<====>58884<====>260 BC   Year 260 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Asina and Duilius (or, less frequently, year 494 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 260 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placeSicilyThe Roman advance continues westward from Agrigentum with their forces relieving the besieged cities of Segesta and Macella.  These cities have sided with the Roman cause, and have come under Carthaginian attack for doing so. 

Business administration<====>58886<====>Business administration Business administration is management of a business.  It includes all aspects of overseeing and supervising business operations and related field which include Accounting, Finance and Marketing. OverviewThe administration of a business includes the performance or management of business operations and decision making, as well as the efficient organization of people and other resources, to direct activities toward common goals and objectives.  In general, administration refers to the broader management function, including the associated finance, personnel and MIS services. Some analyses view management as a subset of administration, specifically associated with the technical and operational aspects of an organization, and distinct from executive or strategic functions. 

An Inspector Calls<====>58888<====>An Inspector Calls    An Inspector Calls is a play written by English dramatist J.  B.  Priestley, first performed in 1945 in the Soviet Union and in 1946 in the UK.  It is one of Priestley's best known works for the stage, and is considered to be one of the classics of mid-20th century English theatre.  The play's success and reputation has been boosted in recent years by a successful revival by English director Stephen Daldry for the National Theatre in 1992,  and a tour of the UK in 2011–2012. The play is a three-act drama, which takes place on a single night in April 1912,  focusing on the prosperous upper middle-class Birling family,    who live in a comfortable home in the fictional town of Brumley, "an industrial city in the north Midlands". 

Resin<====>58890<====>Resin In polymer chemistry and materials science, resin is a "solid or highly viscous substance" of plant or synthetic origin that is typically convertible into polymers.    They are often mixtures of organic compounds, principally terpenes.  Many plants, particularly woody plants, produce resin in response to injury.  The resin acts as a bandage protecting the plant from invading insects and pathogens.  Examples of natural resins and related materialsPlants secrete resins and rosins for their protective benefits.  They confound a wide range of herbivores, insects, and pathogens, while the volatile phenolic compounds may attract benefactors such as parasitoids or predators of the herbivores that attack the plant. 

Johannesburg<====>58893<====>Johannesburg    Johannesburg ( ;  ; also known as Jozi, Joburg and Egoli) is the largest city in South Africa and is one of the 50 largest urban areas in the world.   It is the provincial capital and largest city in Gauteng, which is the wealthiest province in South Africa.   While Johannesburg is not one of South Africa's three capital cities, it is the seat of the Constitutional Court.  The city is located in the mineral-rich Witwatersrand range of hills and is the centre of large-scale gold and diamond trade.  The metropolis is an alpha global city as listed by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. 

Phosphorylation<====>58894<====>Phosphorylation Phosphorylation allows coupling and addition of a phosphoryl group.  This particular biochemistry probably represents the origins of catecholamine overload (PO 3 ) −  to a molecule.  In biology, phosphorylation and its counterpart, dephosphorylation, are critical for many cellular processes.  A large fraction of proteins (between 1/3 to 2/3 of the proteome in eukaryotes    ) are temporarily phosphorylated, as are many sugars, lipids, and other molecules.  Phosphorylation is especially important for protein function as this modification activates (or deactivates) almost half of the enzymes, thereby regulating their function.Protein phosphorylation is considered the most abundant post-translational modification in eukaryotes. 

Music of Latin America<====>58895<====>Music of Latin America   The music of Latin America refers to music originating from Latin America, namely the Romance-speaking countries and territories of the Americas and the Caribbean south of the United States.Latin American music also incorporates African music from slaves who were transported to the Americas by European settlers as well as music from the indigenous peoples of the Americas.   Due to its highly syncretic nature, Latin American music encompasses a wide variety of styles, including influential genres such as bachata, bossa nova, merengue, rumba, salsa, samba, son, and tango. 

NTIA Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management<====>58898<====>NTIA Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management The NTIA Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management, also known as the Red Book, is a publication of the United States Office of Spectrum Management of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration or NTIA, and is the official source for all technical regulations relating to the use of the electromagnetic frequency spectrum. The NTIA is the regulating agency for all Federal spectrum use. External linksA full copy of the manual is available at    

Direct sum of modules<====>58899<====>Direct sum of modules  In abstract algebra, the direct sum is a construction which combines several modules into a new, larger module.  The direct sum of modules is the smallest module which contains the given modules as submodules with no "unnecessary" constraints, making it an example of a coproduct.  Contrast with the direct product, which is the dual notion. The most familiar examples of this construction occur when considering vector spaces (modules over a field) and abelian groups (modules over the ring Z of integers).  The construction may also be extended to cover Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces. 

Unmanned aerial vehicle<====>58900<====>Unmanned aerial vehicle  An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, is an aircraft without a human pilot aboard.  UAVs are a component of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS); which include a UAV, a ground-based controller, and a system of communications between the two.   The flight of UAVs may operate with various degrees of autonomy: either under remote control by a human operator or autonomously by onboard computers.    Compared to manned aircraft, UAVs were originally used for missions too "dull, dirty or dangerous"  for humans.  While they originated mostly in military applications, their use is rapidly expanding to commercial, scientific, recreational, agricultural, and other applications,    such as policing, peacekeeping,  and surveillance, product deliveries, aerial photography, agriculture, smuggling,  and drone racing. 

Ender's Game<====>58901<====>Ender's Game  Ender's Game is a 1985 military science fiction novel by American author Orson Scott Card.  Set at an unspecified date in Earth's future, the novel presents an imperiled mankind after two conflicts with the "buggers", an insectoid alien species.  In preparation for an anticipated third invasion, children, including the novel's protagonist, Ender Wiggin, are trained from a very young age through increasingly difficult games including some in zero gravity, where Ender's tactical genius is revealed. The book originated as the short story "Ender's Game", published in the August 1977 issue of Analog Science Fiction and Fact. 

Rock and Roll Hall of Fame<====>58902<====>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, recognizes and archives the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll.  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun.  In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the Hall of Fame's permanent home.   Since opening in September 1995, the "Rock Hall" – part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor – has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than $1. 

Cloud forest<====>58903<====>Cloud forestA cloud forest, also called a water forest, is a generally tropical or subtropical, evergreen, montane, moist forest characterized by a persistent, frequent or seasonal low-level cloud cover, usually at the canopy level, formally described in the International Cloud Atlas (2017) as silvagenitus.   Cloud forests often exhibit an abundance of mosses covering the ground and vegetation, in which case they are also referred to as mossy forests.  Mossy forests usually develop on the saddles of mountains, where moisture introduced by settling clouds is more effectively retained.  Distribution and climateDependent on local climate, which is affected by the distance to the sea, the exposition and the latitude (from 23°N to 25°S), the altitude varies from 500 m to 4000 m above sea level. 

Serpent (symbolism)<====>58904<====>Serpent (symbolism) The serpent, or snake, is one of the oldest and most widespread mythological symbols.  The word is derived from Latin serpens, a crawling animal or snake.  Snakes have been associated with some of the oldest rituals known to humankind   and represent dual expression  of good and evil.  In some cultures, snakes were fertility symbols.   For example, the Hopi people of North America performed an annual snake dance to celebrate the union of Snake Youth (a Sky spirit) and Snake Girl (an Underworld spirit) and to renew the fertility of Nature. 

Gland<====>58906<====>Gland    A gland is a group of cells  in an animal's body that synthesizes substances (such as hormones) for release into the bloodstream (endocrine gland) or into cavities inside the body or its outer surface (exocrine gland). Structure DevelopmentEvery gland is formed by an ingrowth from an epithelial surface.  This ingrowth may in the beginning possess a tubular structure, but in other instances glands may start as a solid column of cells which subsequently becomes tubulated.    As growth proceeds, the column of cells may divide or give off offshoots, in which case a compound gland is formed. 

Melodica<====>58907<====>Melodica  The melodica, also known as the pianica, blow-organ, key harmonica, or melodyhorn, is a free-reed instrument similar to the pump organ and harmonica.  It has a musical keyboard on top, and is played by blowing air through a mouthpiece that fits into a hole in the side of the instrument.  Pressing a key opens a hole, allowing air to flow through a reed.  The keyboard is usually two or three octaves long.  Melodicas are small, light, and portable.  They are popular in music education, especially in Asia. The modern form of the instrument was invented by Hohner in the 1950s,  though similar instruments have been known in Italy since the 19th century. 

Concertina<====>58908<====>Concertina  A concertina is a free-reed musical instrument, like the various accordions and the harmonica.  It has bellows, and buttons typically on both ends of it.  When pressed, the buttons travel in the same direction as the bellows, unlike accordion buttons, which travel perpendicularly to the bellows. The concertina was developed in England and Germany, most likely independently.  The English version was invented in 1829 by Sir Charles Wheatstone,  while Carl Friedrich Uhlig announced the German version five years later, in 1834.  Various forms of concertina are used for classical music, for the traditional musics of Ireland, England, and South Africa, and for tango and polka music. 

Naboo<====>58909<====>Naboo   Naboo is a planet in the fictional Star Wars universe with a mostly green terrain and which is the homeworld of two spacefaring societies: the Gungans, who dwell in underwater cities, and the humans, who live in colonies on the surface.  Humans of Naboo have an electoral monarchy and maintain a peaceful culture that defends education, the arts, environmental protection and scientific achievements.  The main capital of Naboo is Theed.  Three moons orbit Naboo: Ohma-D'un, Rori, and the third moon of Naboo.  The third moon of Naboo was not given a specific name. 

Measles<====>58911<====>Measles   Measles is a highly contagious infection caused by the measles virus. Initial signs and symptoms typically include fever, often greater than  , cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes.    Two or three days after the start of symptoms, small white spots may form inside the mouth, known as Koplik's spots.   A red, flat rash which usually starts on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body typically begins three to five days after the start of symptoms.Symptoms usually develop 10–12 days after exposure to an infected person and last 7–10 days. 

Heteroecious<====>58912<====>HeteroeciousA heteroecious parasite is one that requires at least two hosts.  The primary host is the host in which the parasite spends its adult life; the other is the secondary host.   Both the primary host and an unrelated alternate host are required for the parasite to complete its life cycle.   This can be contrasted with an autoecious parasite which can complete its life cycle on a single host species.   Many rust fungi are prime examples of a heteroecious life cycle.  Parasitic heteroecious fungi include Gymnosporangium (Cedar-apple rust); the juniper is the primary (telial) host and the apple, pear or hawthorn is the secondary (aecial) hostCronartium ribicola (White pine blister rust); the primary host are white pines, and currants the secondary. 

Oscar-class submarine<====>58913<====>Oscar-class submarineOscar ll class}   Project 949 (Granit) and Project 949A (Antey) are Soviet Navy/Russian Navy cruise missile submarines (NATO reporting names: Oscar I and Oscar II respectively). Project 949 submarines were the largest cruise missile submarines in service, until the   ballistic missile submarines were converted to carry cruise missiles in 2007.  They are the fourth largest class of submarines in displacement and length.  Only the   Soviet/Russian submarines, the American Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines and the Russian  s are larger. HistoryThe first submarine of Project 949 was laid down in the mid-1970s and was commissioned in 1980. 

Battle of Crécy<====>58916<====>Battle of CrécyThe Battle of Crécy (26 August 1346), also called Battle of Cressy, was an English victory during the Edwardian phase of the Hundred Years' War.  Married with the later battles of Poitiers in 1356, and Agincourt in 1415, it was the first of three famous English successes during the conflict. The battle was fought on 26 August 1346 near Crécy, in northern France.  An army of English, Welsh, and allied mercenary troops led by Edward III of England, engaged and defeated a much larger army of French, Genoese and Majorcan troops led by Philip VI of France. 

Edward the Black Prince<====>58917<====>Edward the Black Prince    Edward of Woodstock, known as the Black Prince (15 June 1330 – 8 June 1376),   was the eldest son of Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault and participated in the early years of the Hundred Years War.  He died before his father and so never became king.  His son inherited the Crown on the death of Edward III, becoming King Richard II. Edward was created Duke of Cornwall in 1337.  He was guardian of the kingdom in his father's absence in 1338, 1340, and 1342.  He was created Prince of Wales in 1343 and knighted by his father at La Hogne in 1346. 

Washington University in St. Louis<====>58920<====>Washington University in St.  Louis   Washington University in St.  Louis (also referred to as WashU, or WUSTL) is a private research university located in the St.  Louis metropolitan area and in Missouri, United States.  Founded in 1853, and named after George Washington, the university has students and faculty from all 50 U. S.  states and more than 120 countries.Twenty-five Nobel laureates have been affiliated with Washington University, nine having done the major part of their pioneering research at the university. Washington University's undergraduate program is ranked 18th by U. 

Natural disaster<====>58921<====>Natural disaster  A natural disaster is a major adverse event resulting from natural processes of the Earth; examples include floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, and other geologic processes.  A natural disaster can cause loss of life or property damage,  and typically leaves some economic damage in its wake, the severity of which depends on the affected population's resilience, or ability to recover and also on the infrastructure available.  An adverse event will not rise to the level of a disaster if it occurs in an area without vulnerable population.    In a vulnerable area, however, such as Nepal during the 2015 earthquake, an earthquake can have disastrous consequences and leave lasting damage, which can require years to repair. 

Margrethe II of Denmark<====>58925<====>Margrethe II of Denmark    Margrethe II ( ,  ;  ;  ; full name: Margrethe Alexandrine Þórhildur Ingrid; born 16 April 1940) is the Queen of Denmark.  She is also the supreme authority of the Church of Denmark and Commander-in-Chief of the Danish Defence.  Born into the House of Glücksburg, a royal house with origins in Northern Germany, she was the eldest child of Frederick IX of Denmark and Ingrid of Sweden.  She succeeded her father upon his death on 14 January 1972, having become heir presumptive to her father in 1953, when a constitutional amendment allowed women to inherit the throne. 

Presbyterian polity<====>58926<====>Presbyterian polity Presbyterian (or presbyteral) polity is a method of church governance ("ecclesiastical polity") typified by the rule of assemblies of presbyters, or elders.  Each local church is governed by a body of elected elders usually called the session or consistory, though other terms, such as church board, may apply.   Groups of local churches are governed by a higher assembly of elders known as the presbytery or classis; presbyteries can be grouped into a synod, and presbyteries and synods nationwide often join together in a general assembly.  Responsibility for conduct of church services is reserved to an ordained minister or pastor known as a teaching elder, or a minister of the word and sacrament. 

Ron Howard<====>58928<====>Ron Howard  Ronald William Howard (born March 1, 1954) is an American actor and filmmaker.   Howard is best known for playing two high-profile roles in television sitcoms in his youth and directing a number of successful feature films later in his career. Howard first came to prominence playing young Opie Taylor in the sitcom The Andy Griffith Show for eight years and later playing teenager Richie Cunningham in the sitcom Happy Days for seven years.  Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 1999  He appeared in the musical film The Music Man (1962), the comedy film The Courtship of Eddie's Father (1963), the coming of age film American Graffiti (1973), the western film The Shootist (1976), and the comedy film Grand Theft Auto (1977), which he also directed. 

Witch-hunt<====>58929<====>Witch-hunt   A witch-hunt is a search for people labelled "witches" or evidence of witchcraft, often involving moral panic  or mass hysteria.   The classical period of witch-hunts in Early Modern Europe and Colonial North America took place in the Early Modern period or about 1450 to 1750, spanning the upheavals of the Reformation and the Thirty Years' War, resulting in an estimated 35,000 to 100,000 executions.   Changing Identities in Early Modern France, Michael Wolfe, Duke University Press, 1997: pg.  220.   Including illegal and summary executions it is estimated 200,000 or more "witches" were tortured, burnt or hanged in the Western world from 1500 until around 1800.

Diphtheria<====>58937<====>Diphtheria    Diphtheria is an infection caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae.   Signs and symptoms may vary from mild to severe.   They usually start two to five days after exposure.   Symptoms often come on fairly gradually, beginning with a sore throat and fever.   In severe cases, a grey or white patch develops in the throat.    This can block the airway and create a barking cough as in croup.   The neck may swell in part due to enlarged lymph nodes.   A form of diphtheria that involves the skin, eyes, or genitals also exists.

Galaxy cluster<====>58950<====>Galaxy clusterA galaxy cluster, or cluster of galaxies, is a structure that consists of anywhere from hundreds to thousands of galaxies that are bound together by gravity   with typical masses ranging from 10 14 –10 15  solar masses.  They are the largest known gravitationally bound structures in the universe and were believed to be the largest known structures in the universe until the 1980s, when superclusters were discovered.One of the key features of clusters is the intracluster medium (ICM).  The ICM consists of heated gas between the galaxies and has a peak temperature between 2–15 keV that is dependent on the total mass of the cluster.

Robotic spacecraft<====>58957<====>Robotic spacecraft A robotic spacecraft is an uncrewed spacecraft, usually under telerobotic control.  A robotic spacecraft designed to make scientific research measurements is often called a space probe.  Many space missions are more suited to telerobotic rather than crewed operation, due to lower cost and lower risk factors.   In addition, some planetary destinations such as Venus or the vicinity of Jupiter are too hostile for human survival, given current technology.  Outer planets such as Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are too distant to reach with current crewed spaceflight technology, so telerobotic probes are the only way to explore them.

Observatory<====>58968<====>Observatory An observatory is a location used for observing terrestrial or celestial events.  Astronomy, climatology/meteorology, geophysical, oceanography and volcanology are examples of disciplines for which observatories have been constructed.  Historically, observatories were as simple as containing an astronomical sextant (for measuring the distance between stars) or Stonehenge (which has some alignments on astronomical phenomena). Astronomical observatories Astronomical observatories are mainly divided into four categories: space-based, airborne, ground-based, and underground-based. Ground-based observatories Ground-based observatories, located on the surface of Earth, are used to make observations in the radio and visible light portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Most optical telescopes are housed within a dome or similar structure, to protect the delicate instruments from the elements. 

Apocalypse<====>58970<====>Apocalypse    An apocalypse (Ancient Greek:   apokálypsis, from   and  , literally meaning "an uncovering") is a   of knowledge or revelation.  In religious contexts it is usually a disclosure of something hidden, "a vision of heavenly secrets that can make sense of earthly realities".  In the Book of Revelation (Greek: Ἀποκάλυψις Ἰωάννου, Apokalypsis Ioannou – literally, John's Revelation), the last book of the New Testament, the revelation which John receives is that of the ultimate victory of good over evil and the end of the present age, and that is the primary meaning of the term, one that dates to 1175.

His real name being Stowasser, his pseudonym Hundertwasser (by which he is known worldwide) comes from sto in Czech, meaning "hundred". He stood out as an opponent of "a straight line" and any standardization, expressing this concept in the field of building design.  His best known work is considered Hundertwasserhaus in Vienna, Austria which has become a notable place of interest in the Austrian capital characterized by imaginative vitality and uniqueness. 

Tobacco smoke<====>58981<====>Tobacco smokeTobacco smoke is an aerosol produced by the incomplete combustion of tobacco during the smoking of cigarettes, Smoking pipes, or cigars.  Temperatures in burning cigarettes range from about 400 ℃ between puffs to about 900 ℃ during a puff.  During the burning of tobacco (itself a complex mixture), thousands of chemical substances are generated by combustion, distillation, pyrolysis, and pyrosynthesis. Tobacco smoke is used as a fumigant and inhalant. CompositionThe particles in tobacco smoke are liquid aerosol droplets (~ 20% water), with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) that is submicrometer (and thus, fairly "lung-respirable" by humans). 

Reed (mouthpiece)<====>58984<====>Reed (mouthpiece)A reed is a thin strip of material which vibrates to produce a sound on a musical instrument.  The reeds of most woodwind instruments are made from Arundo donax ("Giant cane") or synthetic material; tuned reeds (as in harmonicas and accordions) are made of metal or synthetics.  Musical instruments may be classified according to the type and number of reeds used. The earliest types of single-reed instruments used idioglottal reeds, where the vibrating reed is a tongue cut and shaped on the tube of cane.  Much later, single-reed instruments started using heteroglottal reeds, where a reed is cut and separated from the tube of cane and attached to a mouthpiece of some sort.

Linear-feedback shift register<====>58992<====>Linear-feedback shift register  In computing, a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) is a shift register whose input bit is a linear function of its previous state. The most commonly used linear function of single bits is exclusive-or (XOR).  Thus, an LFSR is most often a shift register whose input bit is driven by the XOR of some bits of the overall shift register value. The initial value of the LFSR is called the seed, and because the operation of the register is deterministic, the stream of values produced by the register is completely determined by its current (or previous) state. 

Colemanballs<====>58998<====>ColemanballsColemanballs is a term coined by Private Eye magazine to describe verbal gaffes perpetrated by sports commentators.  "TV and Radio Sport's Howlers", BBC. co. uk, 16 December 2005  Coleman refers to the surname of the former BBC broadcaster David Coleman and the suffix -balls, as in "to balls up",   and has since spawned derivative terms in unrelated fields such as "Warballs" (spurious references to the September 11, 2001 attacks) and "Dianaballs" (sentimental references to Diana, Princess of Wales) and "Borisballs" (Boris Johnson).  Any other subject can be covered, as long as it is appropriately suffixed by -balls. 

Guelders<====>59002<====>Guelders   Guelders or Gueldres ( ,  ) is a historical county, later duchy of the Holy Roman Empire, located in the Low Countries.GeographyThe duchy was named after the town of Geldern (Gelder) in present-day Germany. Though the present province of Gelderland (English also Guelders) in the Netherlands occupies most of the area, the former duchy also comprised parts of the present Dutch province of Limburg as well as those territories in the present-day German state of North Rhine-Westphalia that were acquired by Prussia in 1713.Four parts of the duchy had their own centres, as they were separated by rivers:the quarter of Roermond, also called Upper Quarter or Upper Guelders – upstream on both sides of the Maas, comprising the town of Geldern as well as Erkelenz, Goch, Nieuwstadt, Venlo and Straelen;spatially separated from the Lower Quarters (Gelderland):the quarter of Zutphen, also called the Achterhoek – east of the IJssel and north of the Rhine, including Doesburg, Doetinchem, Groenlo and Lochem;the Veluwe Quarter with Arnhem as its capital – west of the IJssel and north of the Rhine, with Elburg, Harderwijk, Hattem and Wageningen;Nijmegen Quarter, including Betuwe – south of the Rhine and north of the Maas (in between the rivers), including Gendt, Maasbommel, Tiel and Zaltbommel.HistoryThe county emerged about 1096, when Gerard III of Wassenberg was first documented as "Count of Guelders". It was then located on the territory of Lower Lorraine, in the area of Geldern and Roermond, with its main stronghold at Montfort (built 1260). Count Gerard's son Gerard II in 1127 acquired the County of Zutphen in northern Hamaland by marriage. In the 12th and 13th century, Guelders quickly expanded downstream along the sides of the Maas, Rhine, and IJssel rivers and even claimed the succession in the Duchy of Limburg, until it lost the 1288 Battle of Worringen against Berg and Brabant.Guelders was often at war with its neighbours, not only with Brabant, but also with the County of Holland and the Bishopric of Utrecht. However, its territory grew not only because of its success in warfare, but also because it thrived in times of peace. For example, the larger part of the Veluwe and the city of Nijmegen were given as collateral to Guelders by their cash-strapped rulers. On separate occasions, in return for loans from the treasury of Guelders, the bishop of Utrecht granted the taxation and administration of the Veluwe, and William II ― Count of both Holland and Zeeland, and who was elected anti-king of the Holy Roman Empire (1248–1256) ― similarly granted the same rights over Nijmegen; as neither ruler proved able to repay their debts, these lands became integral parts of Guelders. In 1339 Count Reginald II of Guelders (also styled Rainald), of the House of Wassenberg, was elevated to the rank of Duke by Emperor Louis IV of Wittelsbach. After the Wassenberg line became extinct in 1371 following the deaths of Reginald II's childless sons Edward II (on 24 August, from wounds suffered in the Battle of Baesweiler) and Reginald III (on 4 December), the ensuing Guelders War of Succession saw William I of Jülich emerge victorious.  William was confirmed in the inheritance of Guelders in 1379, and from 1393 onwards held both duchies in personal union (in Guelders as William I, and in Jülich as William III). In 1423 Guelders passed to the House of Egmond, which gained recognition of its title from Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg, but was unable to escape the political strife and internecine conflict that had so plagued the preceding House of Jülich-Hengebach, and more especially, the pressure brought to bear by the expansionist rulers of the Duchy of Burgundy. The first Egmond Duke, Arnold, suffered the rebellion of his son Adolf and was imprisoned by the latter in 1465.  Adolf, who had enjoyed the support of Burgundian Duke Philip III ("the Good") and of the four major cities of Guelders during his rebellion, was unwilling to strike a compromise with his father when this was demanded by Philip's successor, Duke Charles the Bold. Charles had Duke Adolf captured and imprisoned in 1471 and reinstated Arnold on the throne of the Duchy of Guelders. Charles then bought the reversion (i.e., the right of succession to the throne) from Duke Arnold, who, against the will of the towns and the law of the land, pledged his duchy to Charles for 300,000 Rhenish florins.  The bargain was completed in 1472–73, and upon Arnold's death in 1473, Duke Charles added Guelders to the "Low Countries" portion of his Valois Duchy of Burgundy.  Upon Charles' defeat and death at the Battle of Nancy in January 1477, Duke Adolf was released from prison by the Flemish, but died the same year at the head of a Flemish army besieging Tournai, after the States of Guelders had recognized him once more as Duke. Subsequently, Guelders was ruled by Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, husband of Charles the Bold's daughter and heir, Mary.The last independent Duke of Guelders was Adolf's son Charles of Egmond (1467–1538, r1492–1538), who was  raised at the Burgundian court of Charles the Bold and fought for the House of Habsburg in battles against the armies of Charles VIII of France, until being captured in the Battle of Béthune (1487) during the War of the Public Weal (also known as the Mad War).  In 1492, the citizens of Guelders, who had become disenchanted with the rule of Maximilian, ransomed Charles and recognized him as their Duke. Charles, now backed by France, fought Maximilian's grandson Charles of Habsburg (who became Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V, in 1519) in the Guelders Wars and expanded his realm further north, to incorporate what is now the Province of Overijssel. He was not simply a man of war, but also a skilled diplomat, and was therefore able to keep his independence. He bequeathed the duchy to Duke William the Rich of Jülich-Cleves-Berg (also known as Wilhelm of Cleves).  Following in the footsteps of Charles of Egmond, Duke William formed an alliance with France, an alliance dubiously cemented via his political marriage to French King Francis I's niece Jeanne d'Albret (who reportedly had to be whipped into submission to the marriage,  and later bodily carried to the altar by the Constable of France, Anne de Montmorency).   This alliance emboldened William to challenge Emperor Charles V's claim to Guelders, but the French, mightily engaged on multiple fronts as they were in the long struggle to against the Habsburg "encirclement" of France, proved less reliable than the Duke's ambitions required, and he was unable to hold on to the duchy; in 1543, by the terms of the Treaty of Venlo, Duke William conceded the Duchy of Guelders to the Emperor. Charles united Guelders with the Seventeen Provinces of the Habsburg Netherlands, and Guelders finally lost its independence.Charles V abdicated in 1556 and decreed that the territories of the Burgundian Circle should be held by the Spanish Crown. When the northern Netherlands revolted against King Philip II of Spain in the Dutch Revolt, the three northern quarters of Gelderland joined the Union of Utrecht and became part of the United Provinces upon the 1581 Act of Abjuration, while only the Upper Quarter remained a part of the Spanish Netherlands.At the Treaty of Utrecht, ending the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713, the Spanish Upper Quarter was again divided between Prussian Guelders (Geldern, Viersen, Horst, Venray), the United Provinces (Venlo, Montfort, Echt), Austria (Roermond, Niederkrüchten, Weert), and the Duchy of Jülich (Erkelenz). In 1795 Guelders was finally conquered and incorporated by the French First Republic, and partitioned between the départements of Roer and Meuse-Inférieure.Coat of arms of GueldersThe coat of arms of the region changed over time.

Jug band<====>59019<====>Jug bandA jug band is a band employing a jug player and a mix of conventional and homemade instruments.  These homemade instruments are ordinary objects adapted to or modified for making sound, like the washtub bass, washboard, spoons, bones, stovepipe, and comb and tissue paper (kazoo).  The term jug band is loosely used in referring to ensembles that also incorporate homemade instruments but that are more accurately called skiffle bands, spasm bands, or juke (or jook) bands (see juke joint) because they do not include a jug player.  History In the early days of jug band music, homemade guitars and mandolins were sometimes made from the necks of discarded manufactured guitars fastened to large gourds that were flattened on one side, with a sound-hole cut into the flat side, before drying. 

Washboard (musical instrument)<====>59020<====>Washboard (musical instrument)   The washboard and frottoir (from Cajun French "frotter", to rub) are used as a percussion instrument, employing the ribbed metal surface of the cleaning device as a rhythm instrument.  As traditionally used in jazz, zydeco, skiffle, jug band, and old-time music, the washboard remained in its wooden frame and is played primarily by tapping, but also scraping the washboard with thimbles.  Often the washboard has additional traps, such as a wood block, a cowbell, and even small cymbals.  Conversely, the frottoir (zydeco rubboard) dispenses with the frame and consists simply of the metal ribbing hung around the neck. 

Pierce Egan<====>59022<====>Pierce Egan   Pierce Egan (1772–1849) was a British journalist, sportswriter, and writer on popular culture. LifeEgan's parents were Irish migrants, but he may have been born in the London area.  He went into the printing trade, and was a compositor for George Smeeton in 1812.   He established himself as the country's leading reporter of sporting events, which at the time meant mainly prize-fights and horse-races. It was Egan who first defined boxing as "the sweet science".  He is buried in Highgate Cemetery, North London. WorksFour volumes of Boxiana; or Sketches of Ancient and Modern Pugilism appeared, lavishly illustrated, between 1813 and 1824.

Geelong<====>59033<====>Geelong    Geelong (   ) is a port city located on Corio Bay and the Barwon River, in the state of Victoria, Australia,   south-west of the state capital, Melbourne.  It is the second largest Victorian city, with an estimated urban population of 192,393   Estimated resident population, 30 June 2016.   as at June 2016, having grown 2. 1 percent since June 2015.  Geelong runs from the plains of Lara in the north to the rolling hills of Waurn Ponds to the south, with Corio Bay to the east and hills to the west. 

Vaduz<====>59036<====>Vaduz  Vaduz ( ;   or  )  is the capital of Liechtenstein and also the seat of the national parliament.  The town, which is located along the Rhine River, has about 5,407 residents  . Although Vaduz is the best known town internationally in the principality, it is not the largest; neighbouring Schaan has a larger population. History Vaduz is said to be mentioned in historic 12th-century manuscripts as Farduzes.  It is, however, commonly believed to have been founded circa 1322 by the Counts of Werdenberg.  In 1322 a mention of the castle is made, which was sacked by the Swiss in 1499 during the Swabian War. 

Fourier series<====>59038<====>Fourier series  In mathematics, a Fourier series ( )  is a way to represent a function as the sum of simple sine waves.  More formally, it decomposes any periodic function or periodic signal into the sum of a (possibly infinite) set of simple oscillating functions, namely sines and cosines  (or, equivalently, complex exponentials).   The discrete-time Fourier transform is a periodic function, often defined in terms of a Fourier series.   The Z-transform, another example of application, reduces to a Fourier series for the important case |z|=1.   Fourier series are also central to the original proof of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem. 

Melaleuca<====>59039<====>Melaleuca   Melaleuca   is a genus of nearly 300 species of plants in the myrtle family,  Myrtaceae, commonly known as paperbarks, honey-myrtles or tea-trees (although the last name is also applied to species of Leptospermum).  They range in size from small shrubs that rarely grow to more than 1 m (3 ft) high, to trees up to 35 m (100 ft).  Their flowers generally occur in groups, forming a “head” or “spike” resembling a brush used for cleaning bottles, containing up to 80 individual flowers.  They are superficially like Banksia species, which also have their flowers in a spike, but the structures of individual flowers in the two genera are very different. 

Aristobulus III of Judea<====>59042<====>Aristobulus III of JudeaAristobulus III (53–36 BC) was the last scion of the Hasmonean royal house, brother of Herod the Great's wife Mariamne, and paternal grandson of Aristobulus II.  He was a favorite of the people on account of his noble descent and handsome presence, and thus became an object of fear to Herod, who at first sought to ignore him entirely by debarring him from the high priesthood.  But his mother Alexandra (63 BC – 28 BC), through intercession with Cleopatra and Mark Antony, compelled Herod to remove Ananelus from the office of High Priest and appoint Aristobulus instead. 

Asher ben Jehiel<====>59043<====>Asher ben Jehiel   Asher ben Jehiel ( , or Asher ben Yechiel, sometimes Asheri) (1250 or 1259 – 1327) was an eminent rabbi and Talmudist best known for his abstract of Talmudic law.  He is often referred to as Rabbenu Asher, “our Rabbi Asher” or by the Hebrew acronym for this title, the ROSH ( , literally "Head").  His yahrzeit is on the 9 Cheshvan. BiographyThe Rosh was probably born in Cologne, Holy Roman Empire,  and died in Toledo.  His family was prominent for learning and piety, his father Yechiel was a Talmudist, and one of his ancestors was Rabbi Eliezer ben Nathan (the RaABaN). 

Rav Ashi<====>59044<====>Rav Ashi For the seventh generation Amora sage of Babylon, see Mar b.  Rav Ashi (his son).  Rav Ashi ( ) ("Rabbi Ashi") (352–427) was a Babylonian Amoraic Talmid Chacham, who reestablished the Academy at Sura and was first editor of the Babylonian Talmud.  According to a tradition preserved in the academies, Rav Ashi was born in the same year that Rava, the great teacher of Mahuza, died, and he was the first teacher of any importance in the Talmudic Academies in Babylonia after Raba's death.  Simai, Ashi's father, was a rich and learned man, a student of the college of Naresh near Sura, which was directed by Rav Papa, Raba's disciple. 

NATO phonetic alphabet<====>59045<====>NATO phonetic alphabet The International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet, commonly known as the ICAO phonetic alphabet, and in a variation also known officially as the ITU phonetic alphabet and figure code, sometimes called the NATO phonetic alphabet, is the most widely used radiotelephone spelling alphabet.  Although often called "phonetic alphabets", spelling alphabets are unrelated to phonetic transcription systems such as the International Phonetic Alphabet.  Instead, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) alphabet assigned codewords acrophonically to the letters of the English alphabet, so that critical combinations of letters and numbers are most likely to be pronounced and understood by those who exchange voice messages by radio or telephone, regardless of language differences or the quality of the communication channel. 

Silly Putty<====>59046<====>Silly Putty Silly Putty is a toy based on silicone polymers that have unusual physical properties.  It bounces, but it breaks when given a sharp blow, and it can also flow like a liquid.  It contains a viscoelastic liquid silicone, a type of non-Newtonian fluid, which makes it act as a viscous liquid over a long time period but as an elastic solid over a short time period.  It was originally created during research into potential rubber substitutes for use by the United States in World War II.    The name Silly Putty is a trademark of Crayola LLC; the company's factory is based in Easton, Pennsylvania.

Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)<====>59052<====>Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)  In mathematical physics, especially as introduced into statistical mechanics and thermodynamics by J.  Willard Gibbs in 1902, an ensemble (also statistical ensemble) is an idealization consisting of a large number of virtual copies (sometimes infinitely many) of a system, considered all at once, each of which represents a possible state that the real system might be in.  In other words, a statistical ensemble is a probability distribution for the state of the system.    A thermodynamic ensemble is a specific variety of statistical ensemble that, among other properties, is in statistical equilibrium (defined below), and is used to derive the properties of thermodynamic systems from the laws of classical or quantum mechanics.

Consumer education<====>59077<====>Consumer education Consumer education is the preparation of an individual through skills, concepts and understanding that are required for everyday living to achieve maximum satisfaction and utilization of his/her resources.  It is defined as education given to the consumer about various consumer goods and services, covering price, what the consumer can expect, standard trade practice, etc.  Such information may be relayed through magazines, websites or word of mouth.  While consumer education can help consumers to make more informed decisions, some researchers have found that its effects can drop off over time, suggesting the need for education initiatives to be ongoing or periodically repeated. 

Arena Football League<====>59084<====>Arena Football League   The Arena Football League (AFL) is a professional indoor American football league in the United States.  It was founded in 1987 by Jim Foster, making it the third longest-running professional football league in North America, after the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the National Football League (NFL).  The AFL plays a proprietary code known as arena football, a form of indoor American football played on a 66-by-28 yard field (about a quarter of the surface area of an NFL field), with rules encouraging offensive performance, resulting in a faster-paced and higher-scoring game.  The sport was invented in the early 1980s and patented by Foster, a former executive of the United States Football League (USFL) and the NFL. 

AF2<====>59091<====>AF2   AF2 (often styled as af2, and short for arenafootball2) was the name of the Arena Football League's developmental league; it was founded in 1999 and played its first season in 2000.   Like its parent AFL, the AF2 played using the same arena football rules and style of play.   League seasons ran from April through July with the postseason and ArenaCup championship in August.   The AF2 continued to operate while the AFL suspended operations for its 2009 season.   The league was effectively disbanded in September 2009 when no team committed to playing in 2010, but several of the stronger franchises transferred into the reconstituted AFL. 

Health maintenance organization<====>59097<====>Health maintenance organization   In the United States a health maintenance organization (HMO) is a medical insurance group that provides health services for a fixed annual fee.   It is an organization that provides or arranges managed care for health insurance, self-funded health care benefit plans, individuals, and other entities, acting as a liaison with health care providers (hospitals, doctors, etc. ) on a prepaid basis.  The Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973 required employers with 25 or more employees to offer federally certified HMO options if the employer offers traditional healthcare options.   Unlike traditional indemnity insurance, an HMO covers care rendered by those doctors and other professionals who have agreed by contract to treat patients in accordance with the HMO's guidelines and restrictions in exchange for a steady stream of customers. 

German submarine U-413<====>59098<====>German submarine U-413  }    U-413 was a Type VIIC U-boat built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine for service during World War II. She was commissioned  in mid 1942, with Oberleutnant zur See Gustav Poel in command.  Poel commanded her (receiving promotion to Kapitänleutnant), until 19 April 1944, when he was relieved by Oberleutnant zur See Dietrich Sachse who commanded her until her loss. U-413 was laid down on 25 April 1941 at the Danziger Werft (as yard number 114), launched on 15 January 1942 and commissioned on 3 June.  She conducted eight patrols in World War II, sinking six ships totalling  . 

Type XIV submarine<====>59104<====>Type XIV submarine}   The Type XIV U-boat was a modification of the Type IXD, designed to resupply other U-boats, being the only Submarine tenders built which were not surface ships.  They were nicknamed "Milchkuh/Milchkühe (pl. )" (milk cows).  Due to its large size, the Type XIV could resupply other boats with   of fuel,   of motor oil, four torpedoes,  and fresh food that was preserved in refrigerator units.  In addition, the boats were equipped with bakeries, in order to provide the luxury of fresh bread for crews being resupplied.  They had no torpedo tubes or deck guns, only anti-aircraft guns. 

Socialized medicine<====>59111<====>Socialized medicine  Socialized medicine is a term used in the United States to describe and discuss systems of universal health care: medical and hospital care for all at a nominal cost by means of government regulation of health care and subsidies derived from taxation.   Because of historically negative associations with socialism in American culture, the term is usually used pejoratively in American political discourse.  Paul Burleigh Horton, Gerald R.  Leslie, The Sociology of Social Problems, 1965, p. 59 (cited as an example of a standard propaganda device). Dorothy Porter, Health, Civilization, and the State, Routledge, p.

He is also the greatest artist of Rabindra Sangeet.  He won two National awards for the category best male playback singer.  He is often credited as one of the greatest Indian singers of all time for his unparalleled manly voice. Early lifeHemanta was born in the city of Varanasi, India in the house of his maternal grandfather who was a leading physician. 

Packet analyzer<====>59114<====>Packet analyzer  A packet analyzer (also known as a network analyzer, protocol analyzer or packet sniffer—or, for particular types of networks, an Ethernet sniffer or wireless sniffer) is a computer program or piece of computer hardware that can intercept and log traffic that passes over a digital network or part of a network.   As data streams flow across the network, the sniffer captures each packet and, if needed, decodes the packet's raw data, showing the values of various fields in the packet, and analyzes its content according to the appropriate RFC or other specifications. Packet capture is the process of intercepting and logging traffic. 

Strait of Tartary<====>59120<====>Strait of TartaryStrait of Tartary or Gulf of Tartary ( ;  ;  ) is a strait in the Pacific Ocean dividing the Russian island of Sakhalin from mainland Asia (South-East Russia), connecting the Sea of Okhotsk on the north with the Sea of Japan on the south.  It is   long,  4–20 m (13-66 ft) deep, and   wide at the narrowest point. History"Tartary" is an older name used by Europeans to refer to a vast region covering Inner Asia, Central Asia and North Asia.  The toponym is derived from the Medieval ethnonym "Tartars", which was applied to various Turco-Mongol semi-nomadic empires. 

Logical abacus<====>59121<====>Logical abacusA logical abacus is a mechanical digital computer. Also referred to as a "logical machine", the logical abacus is analogous to the ordinary (mathematical) abacus.  It is based on the principle of truth tables. It is constructed to show all the possible combinations of a set of logical terms with their negatives, and, further, the way in which these combinations are affected by the addition of attributes or other limiting words, i. e. , to simplify mechanically the solution of logical problems.   These instruments are all more or less elaborate developments of the "logical slate", on which were written in vertical columns all the combinations of symbols or letters that could logically be made out of a definite number of terms. 

Sea of Japan<====>59122<====>Sea of Japan  The Sea of Japan (see below for other names) is a marginal sea between the Japanese archipelago, Sakhalin, the Korean Peninsula and Russia.  The Japanese archipelago separates the sea from the Pacific Ocean.  It is bordered by Japan, Korea (North and South) and Russia.  Like the Mediterranean Sea, it has almost no tides due to its nearly complete enclosure from the Pacific Ocean.This isolation also reflects in the fauna species and in the water salinity, which is lower than in the ocean.  The sea has no large islands, bays or capes. 

Comma<====>59125<====>Comma   The comma   is a punctuation mark that appears in several variants in different languages.  It has the same shape as an apostrophe or single closing quotation mark in many typefaces, but it differs from them in being placed on the baseline of the text.  Some typefaces render it as a small line, slightly curved or straight but inclined from the vertical, or with the appearance of a small, filled-in  . The comma is used in many contexts and languages, mainly for separating parts of a sentence such as clauses, and items in lists, particularly when there are three or more items listed. 

Apostrophe<====>59126<====>Apostrophe    The apostrophe (  ’  or ' ) character is a punctuation mark, and sometimes a diacritical mark, in languages that use the Latin alphabet and some other alphabets.  In English it is used for several purposes: The marking of the omission of one or more letters (as in the contraction of do not to don't). The marking of possessive case (as in the eagle's feathers, or in one month's time). The marking of plurals of individual characters (e. g.  p's and q's, three a's, four i's, and two u's, Oakland A's). The word apostrophe comes ultimately from Greek   ( , '[the accent of] turning away', or 'elision'), through Latin and French. 

Gennady Nevelskoy<====>59127<====>Gennady Nevelskoy  Gennady Ivanovich Nevelskoy ( ;   in Drakino, now in Soligalichsky District, Kostroma Oblast –   in St.  Petersburg) was a Russian navigator. In 1848 Nevelskoy led the expedition in the Russian Far East, exploring the area of the Sakhalin and the outlet of the Amur River.  He proved that the Strait of Tartary was not a gulf, but indeed a strait, connected to Amur's estuary by a narrow section later called Nevelskoy Strait.  On 13 August 1850 he founded Nikolayevsk-on-Amur, the first Russian settlement in the region. Not knowing about the efforts of Japanese navigator Mamiya Rinzō who explored the same area forty years earlier, the Russians took Nevelskoy's report as the first proof that Sakhalin is indeed an island. 

Colon (punctuation)<====>59131<====>Colon (punctuation)  The colon ( : ) is a punctuation mark consisting of two equally sized dots centered on the same vertical line.  A colon precedes an explanation or an enumeration, or list.  A colon is also used with ratios, titles and subtitles of books, city and publisher in bibliographies, Biblical citations between chapter and verse, and—in American English—to separate hours and minutes, for business letter salutations and in formal letter writing.  In Unicode, it is encoded at  . UsageThe most common use of the colon is to inform the reader that what follows the colon proves, explains, defines, describes, or lists elements of what preceded it. 

Hauts-de-Seine<====>59133<====>Hauts-de-Seine {{Infobox settlement }}Hauts-de-Seine ( ; literally Seine Heights) is a department of France.  It is part of the Métropole du Grand Paris and of the Île-de-France region, and covers the western inner suburbs of Paris.  It is small and densely populated and contains the modern office, theatre, and shopping complex known as La Défense. GeographyHauts-de-Seine and two other small départements, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne, form a ring around Paris, known as the Petite Couronne (i. e.  "little crown") and are together with the City of Paris included in the Greater Paris since 1 January 2016. AdministrationHauts-de-Seine is made up of three departmental arrondissements and 36 communes: GovernmentHauts-de-Seine has a general council of which members are called general councillors. 

Paris Commune<====>59134<====>Paris Commune   The Paris Commune ( ,  ) was a radical socialist and revolutionary government that ruled Paris from 28 March to 28 May 1871.  Following the defeat of Emperor Napoleon III in September 1870, the French Second Empire swiftly collapsed.  In its stead rose a Third Republic at war with Prussia, which laid siege to Paris for four months.  A hotbed of working-class radicalism, France's capital was primarily defended during this time by the often politicized and radical troops of the National Guard rather than regular Army troops.  In February 1871 Adolphe Thiers, the new chief executive of the French national government, signed an armistice with Prussia that disarmed the Army but not the National Guard. 

Solemnity<====>59135<====>SolemnityA solemnity is a feast day of the highest rank in the liturgical calendar of the Roman Rite, celebrating a mystery of faith such as the Trinity, an event in the life of Jesus, his mother Mary, or another important saint.  The observance begins with the vigil on the evening before the actual date of the feast.  Unlike feast days of the rank of feast (other than feasts of the Lord) or those of the rank of memorial, solemnities replace the celebration of Sundays outside Advent, Lent, and Easter (those in Ordinary Time).  Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, 59 The word comes from Latin sollemnitas, derived from sollus (whole) and annus (year), indicating an annual celebration. 

Slush fund<====>59150<====>Slush fund  A slush fund, also known as a black fund, is a fund or account maintained for corrupt or illegal purposes, especially in the political sphere.   Such funds may be kept hidden and maintained separately from other funds that are used for legitimate purposes.  They may be employed by government or corporate officials as part of efforts to discreetly pay influential people in return for preferential treatment, advance information (for example, to acquire non-public information in financial transactions) or some other service.   The funds themselves may not be kept secret but the source of the funds or how they were acquired or for what purposes they are used may be hidden. 

Asterisk<====>59152<====>Asterisk   An asterisk (*); from Late Latin  , from Ancient Greek  , asteriskos, "little star")   is a typographical symbol or glyph.  It is so called because it resembles a conventional image of a star.   Computer scientists and mathematicians often vocalize it as star (as, for example, in the A* search algorithm or C*-algebra).  In English, an asterisk is usually five-pointed in sans-serif typefaces, six-pointed in serif typefaces,  and six- or eight-pointed when handwritten.  It can be used as censorship.  It is also used on the Internet to correct one's spelling. 

Ampersand<====>59153<====>Ampersand    The ampersand is the logogram &, representing the conjunction "and".  It originated as a ligature of the letters et—Latin for "and".  EtymologyThe word ampersand is a corruption of the phrase "and per se & (and)", meaning "and by itself and (represented by the symbol &)".    cited in   Traditionally, when reciting the alphabet in English-speaking schools, any letter that could also be used as a word in itself ("A", "I", and, at one point, "O") was repeated with the Latin expression per se ("by itself"). This habit was useful in spelling where a word or syllable was repeated after spelling; e. 

Bullet (typography)<====>59155<====>Bullet (typography)In typography, a bullet (   •   ) is a typographical symbol or glyph used to introduce items in a  .  For example:Item 1Item 2Item 3The bullet symbol may take any of a variety of shapes, such as circular, square, diamond or arrow.  Typical word processor software offers a wide selection of shapes and colors.  Several regular symbols, such as * (asterisk), - (hyphen), .  (period), and even o (lowercase O), are conventionally used in ASCII-only text or other environments where bullet characters are not available. 

Dry ice<====>59156<====>Dry iceDry ice, sometimes referred to as "cardice" (chiefly by British chemists), is the solid form of carbon dioxide.  It is used primarily as a cooling agent.  Its advantages include lower temperature than that of water ice and not leaving any residue (other than incidental frost from moisture in the atmosphere).  It is useful for preserving frozen foods where mechanical cooling is unavailable. Dry ice sublimates at  , at Earth atmospheric pressures.  This extreme cold makes the solid dangerous to handle without protection due to burns caused by freezing (frostbite).  While generally not very toxic, the outgassing from it can cause hypercapnia  (abnormally elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood) due to buildup in confined locations. 

Sociology of knowledge<====>59157<====>Sociology of knowledge   The sociology of knowledge is the study of the relationship between human thought and the social context within which it arises, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies.  It is not a specialized area of sociology but instead deals with broad fundamental questions about the extent and limits of social influences on individuals' lives and the social-cultural basics of our knowledge about the world.   Complementary to the sociology of knowledge is the sociology of ignorance,  including the study of nescience, ignorance, knowledge gaps, or non-knowledge as inherent features of knowledge making. 

Confirmation bias<====>59160<====>Confirmation biasConfirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, David Perkins, a professor and researcher at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, coined the term "myside bias" referring to a preference for "my" side of an issue.is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses.   It is a type of cognitive bias and a systematic error of inductive reasoning.  People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way. 

Dagger (typography)<====>59161<====>Dagger (typography)A dagger, obelisk or obelus (   ) is a typographical symbol usually used to indicate a footnote if an asterisk has already been used.   It is present in Unicode as  .  The term "obelisk" derives from the   ( ), which means "little obelus"; from   ( ) meaning "roasting spit".It was originally represented by the subtraction (   ) and division (   ) symbols by Ancient Greek scholars as critical marks in manuscripts. A double dagger or diesis (   ) is a variant with two handles that is usually used for a third footnote after the asterisk and dagger. 

Cassowary<====>59166<====>Cassowary  Cassowaries ( ), genus Casuarius, are ratites (flightless birds without a keel on their sternum bone) that are native to the tropical forests of New Guinea (Papua New Guinea and Indonesia), nearby islands, and northeastern Australia.  Clements, J.  (2007) There are three extant species.  The most common of these, the southern cassowary, is the third-tallest and second-heaviest living bird, smaller only than the ostrich and emu. Cassowaries feed mainly on fruit, although all species are truly omnivorous and will take a range of other plant food, including shoots and grass seeds, in addition to fungi, invertebrates, and small vertebrates. 

Mumps<====>59171<====>MumpsMumps is a viral disease caused by the mumps virus.   Initial signs and symptoms often include fever, muscle pain, headache, and feeling tired.   This is then usually followed by painful swelling of one or both parotid salivary glands.Symptoms typically occur 16 to 18 days after exposure and resolve after seven to ten days.    Symptoms in adults are often more severe than in children.   About a third of people have mild or no symptoms.   Complications may include meningitis (15 percent), pancreatitis (four percent), permanent deafness, and testicular inflammation which uncommonly results in infertility. 

Judas Iscariot<====>59172<====>Judas Iscariot   Judas Iscariot (died   AD) was one of  the twelve original disciples of Jesus Christ and son of Simon Iscariot, according to  the New Testament. Judas is known for the kiss and betrayal of Jesus to the Sanhedrin for 30 silver coins.   His name is often used synonymously with betrayal or treason.  Though accounts of his death are varied, the traditional version sees him as having hanged himself following the betrayal, as recorded in the Gospel of Matthew.  His place among the Twelve Apostles was later filled by Matthias. 

Id, ego and super-ego<====>59173<====>Id, ego and super-ego   The id, ego and super-ego are three distinct, yet interacting agents in the psychic apparatus defined in Sigmund Freud's structural model of the psyche.   The three parts are the theoretical constructs in terms of whose activity and interaction our mental life is described.  According to this Freudian model of the psyche, the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends; the super-ego plays the critical and moralizing role; and the ego is the organized, realistic part that mediates between the desires of the id and the super-ego.  As Freud explained: "The functional importance of the ego is manifested in the fact that normally control over the approaches to motility devolves upon it. 

Widukind<====>59176<====>Widukind  Widukind, also known as Widuking or Wittekind, was a Germanic leader of the Saxons and the chief opponent of the Frankish king Charlemagne during the Saxon Wars from 777 to 785.  Charlemagne ultimately prevailed, organized Saxony as a Frankish province and ordered conversions of the pagan Saxons to Roman Catholicism.  In later times, Widukind became a symbol of Saxon independence and a figure of legend - the Codex Wittekindeus is said to have been owned by him. LifeVery little is known about Widukind's life.  His name literally translates as "Child of the wood" (i. e. 

Caroline County, Maryland<====>59180<====>Caroline County, Maryland Caroline County is a rural county located in the U. S.  state of Maryland on its Eastern Shore.

Its county seat is Denton.Caroline County is bordered by Queen Anne's County to the north, Talbot County to the west, Dorchester County to the south, Kent County, Delaware, to the east, and Sussex County, Delaware, to the southeast.  HistoryCaroline County was created in 1774  from parts of Dorchester and Queen Anne's counties.  The county derives its name from Lady Caroline Eden, wife of Maryland's last colonial governor, Robert Eden. 

Transactional analysis<====>59182<====>Transactional analysis  Transactional analysis (TA) is a psychoanalytic theory and method of therapy wherein social transactions are analyzed to determine the ego state of the patient (whether parent-like, child-like, or adult-like) as a basis for understanding behavior.   In transactional analysis, the patient is taught to alter the ego state as a way to solve emotional problems.  The method deviates from Freudian psychoanalysis which focuses on increasing awareness of the contents of unconsciously held ideas.  Eric Berne developed the concept and paradigm of transactional analysis in the late 1950s.    HistoryEric Berne presented transactional analysis to the world as a phenomenological approach supplementing Freud's philosophical construct with observable data. 

Widukind of Corvey<====>59184<====>Widukind of Corvey Widukind of Corvey (c.  925 after 973) was a medieval Saxon chronicler.  His three-volume Res gestae saxonicae sive annalium libri tres is an important chronicle of 10th-century Germany during the rule of the Ottonian dynasty. LifeIn view of his name, he possibly was a descendant of the Saxon leader and national hero Widukind, mentioned in the Royal Frankish Annals, who had battled Charlemagne in the Saxon Wars from 777 to 785.  Widukind the Chronicler entered the Benedictine abbey of Corvey in the Westphalian part of Saxony around 940/42, probably to become a tutor.  It is widely assumed that he had reached the age of 15 upon his access, though it has been recently suggested that he may have joined the Order as a child. 

Carroll County, Maryland<====>59185<====>Carroll County, Maryland Carroll County is a county located in the U. S.  state of Maryland.

Royal Welch Fusiliers<====>59195<====>Royal Welch Fusiliers The Royal Welch Fusiliers was a line infantry regiment of the British Army, part of the Prince of Wales' Division.  It was founded in 1689 to oppose James II and to take part in the imminent war with France.  The regiment was numbered as the 23rd Regiment of Foot, though it was one of the first regiments to be granted the honour of a fusilier title and so was known as The Welch Regiment of Fusiliers from 1702.  The "Royal" accolade was earned fighting in the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713. It was one of the oldest infantry regiments in the British Army, hence the archaic spelling of the word Welch instead of Welsh. 

Blohm+Voss<====>59198<====>Blohm+Voss  Blohm+Voss (B+V), also written historically as Blohm & Voss, Blohm und Voß etc, is a German shipbuilding and engineering company, Founded in Hamburg in 1877, its most famous product is the World War II battleship Bismarck.  In the 1930s its owners established the Hamburger Flugzeugbau aircraft manufacturer which, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, adopted the name of its parent company. B+V became a subsidiary of Lürssen in 2016 and continues to supply both the military and civil markets.  The company also carries out related activities, managing a dockyard in Hamburg and undertaking maintenance and repair of large cruise ships. 

Object-relational mapping<====>59202<====>Object-relational mapping  Object-relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages.  This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.  There are both free and commercial packages available that perform object-relational mapping, although some programmers opt to construct their own ORM tools. In object-oriented programming, data-management tasks act on object-oriented (OO) objects that are almost always non-scalar values.  For example, consider an address book entry that represents a single person along with zero or more phone numbers and zero or more addresses. 

Pope Hyginus<====>59204<====>Pope Hyginus  Pope Hyginus (died c.  142) was the Bishop of Rome from c.  138 to c.  142.   Tradition holds that during his papacy he determined the various prerogatives of the clergy and defined the grades of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. He also decreed that all churches be consecrated.  He is said to have died a martyr, though no records verify this.  The chronology of the early bishops of Rome cannot be determined with any degree of exactitude today. HistoryAccording to the Liber Pontificalis, Hyginus was a Greek by birth.  Kirsch, Johann Peter. 

Pope Pius X<====>59205<====>Pope Pius X   Pope Saint Pius X ( ), born Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto,  (2 June 1835 – 20 August 1914) was head of the Catholic Church from August 1903 to his death in 1914.  He was canonized in 1954.  Pius X is known for vigorously opposing modernist interpretations of Catholic doctrine, promoting traditional devotional practices and orthodox theology.  His most important reform was to order the codification of the first Code of Canon Law, which collected the laws of the Church into one volume for the first time.  He was also considered a pastoral pope, in the sense of encouraging personal holiness, piety and a daily lifestyle reflecting deep Christian values. 

Pope Gelasius I<====>59207<====>Pope Gelasius I  Pope Gelasius I (died 19 November 496) was Pope from 1 March 492 to his death in 496.He was probably the third and last Bishop of Rome of Berber descent  in the Catholic Church.  Gelasius was a prolific writer whose style placed him on the cusp between Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages.  The title of his biography by Walter Ullmann expresses this:Gelasius I.  (492–496): Das Papsttum an der Wende der Spätantike zum Mittelalter (Stuttgart) 1981.   Gelasius had been employed by his predecessor Felix III, especially in drafting papal documents. 

Alfred, Lord Tennyson<====>59209<====>Alfred, Lord TennysonAlfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, FRS (6 August 1809 – 6 October 1892) was Poet Laureate of Great Britain and Ireland during much of Queen Victoria's reign and remains one of the most popular British poets.  Tennyson excelled at penning short lyrics, such as "Break, Break, Break", "The Charge of the Light Brigade", "Tears, Idle Tears", and "Crossing the Bar".  Much of his verse was based on classical mythological themes, such as Ulysses, although "In Memoriam A. H. H. " was written to commemorate his friend Arthur Hallam, a fellow poet and student at Trinity College, Cambridge, after he died of a stroke at the age of 22. 

Altitude<====>59211<====>Altitude    Altitude or height (sometimes known as depth) is defined based on the context in which it is used (aviation, geometry, geographical survey, sport, atmospheric pressure, and many more).  As a general definition, altitude is a distance measurement, usually in the vertical or "up" direction, between a reference datum and a point or object.  The reference datum also often varies according to the context.  Although the term altitude is commonly used to mean the height above sea level of a location, in geography the term elevation is often preferred for this usage. Vertical distance measurements in the "down" direction are commonly referred to as depth. 

Free trade<====>59212<====>Free trade Free trade is a policy followed by some international markets in which countries' governments do not restrict imports from, or exports to, other countries.  Free trade is exemplified by the European Economic Area  and the Mercosur, which have established open markets.  Most nations are today members of the World Trade Organization (WTO)  multilateral trade agreements.  However, most governments still impose some protectionist policies that are intended to support local employment, such as applying tariffs to imports or subsidies to exports.  Governments may also restrict free trade to limit exports of natural resources.

She also played Cordelia in King Lear, Imogen in Cymbeline and later Olivia in Twelfth Night. 

Customs<====>59214<====>Customs  Customs is an authority or agency in a country responsible for collecting tariffs and for controlling the flow of goods, including animals, transports, personal, and hazardous items, into and out of a country.   The movement of people into and out of a country is normally monitored by immigration authorities, under a variety of names and arrangements.  The immigration authorities normally check for appropriate documentation, verify that a person is entitled to enter the country, apprehend people wanted by domestic or international arrest warrants, and impede the entry of people deemed dangerous to the country.  In many places, K9 units are also used. 

Liza Minnelli<====>59216<====>Liza Minnelli  Liza May Minnelli ( ; born March 12, 1946) is an American actress and singer.

Quadratic formula<====>59217<====>Quadratic formulaIn elementary algebra, the quadratic formula is the solution of the quadratic equation.  There are other ways to solve the quadratic equation instead of using the quadratic formula, such as factoring, completing the square, or graphing.  Using the quadratic formula is often the most convenient way. The general quadratic equation is ax^2+bx+c=0.  Here   represents an unknown, while  ,  , and   are constants with   not equal to 0.  One can verify that the quadratic formula satisfies the quadratic equation by inserting the former into the latter.  With the above parameterization, the quadratic formula is: x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}. 

Gulf Oil<====>59218<====>Gulf OilGulf Oil was a major global oil company from the 1900s to the 1980s.   The eighth-largest American manufacturing company in 1941 and the ninth-largest in 1979, Gulf Oil was one of the so-called Seven Sisters oil companies.  Prior to its merger with Standard Oil of California, Gulf was one of the chief instruments of the Mellon family fortune; both Gulf and Mellon Financial had their headquarters in Pittsburgh. Gulf's former headquarters, originally referred to as "the Gulf Building" (now the Gulf Tower office condos), is an Art Deco skyscraper.  The tallest building in Pittsburgh until 1970, when it was eclipsed by the U. 

Sicarii<====>59219<====>Sicarii The Sicarii (Modern Hebrew: סיקריים siqari'im) were a splinter group of the Jewish Zealots who, in the decades preceding Jerusalem's destruction in 70 CE, were opposed to the Roman occupation of Judea and attempted to spur on zealous movements and their sympathizers via covert combat.   The Sicarii carried sicae, or small daggers, concealed in their cloaks.   At public gatherings, they pulled out these daggars to quickly dispatch unsuspecting Romans and Hebrew Roman sympathizers alike, subsequently blending into the crowd. The Sicarii were likely one of the earliest forms of an organized assassination unit of cloak and daggers, predating the Islamic Hashishin and Japanese  Ninja s by centuries. 

Base (topology)<====>59220<====>Base (topology)In mathematics, a base (or basis) B for a topological space X with topology T is a collection of open sets in T such that every open set in T can be written as a union of elements of B.    We are using a convention that the union of empty collection of sets is the empty set.   We say that the base generates the topology T.  Bases are useful because many properties of topologies can be reduced to statements about a base generating that topology, and because many topologies are most easily defined in terms of a base which generates them. 

RealAudio<====>59222<====>RealAudio  RealAudio is a proprietary audio format developed by RealNetworks and first released in April 1995.  It uses a variety of audio codecs, ranging from low-bitrate formats that can be used over dialup modems, to high-fidelity formats for music.  It can also be used as a streaming audio format, that is played at the same time as it is downloaded.  In the past, many internet radio stations used RealAudio to stream their programming over the internet in real time.  In recent years, however, the format has become less common and has given way to more popular audio formats. 

Texaco<====>59224<====>Texaco    Texaco, Inc.  ("The Texas Company") is an American oil subsidiary of Chevron Corporation.  Its flagship product is its fuel "Texaco with Techron".  It also owns the Havoline motor oil brand.  Texaco was an independent company until its refining operations merged into Chevron Corporation in 2001, at which time most of its station franchises were divested to the Shell Oil Company.  It began as the Texas Fuel Company, founded in 1901 in Beaumont, Texas, by Joseph S.  Cullinan, Thomas J.  Donoghue, Walter Benona Sharp, and Arnold Schlaet upon the discovery of oil at Spindletop. 

Chevron (insignia)<====>59226<====>Chevron (insignia)  A chevron (also spelled cheveron, especially in older documents) is a V-shaped mark, often inverted.  The word is usually used in reference to a kind of fret in architecture, or to a badge or insignia used in military or police uniforms to indicate rank or length of service, or in heraldry and the designs of flags (see flag terminology). Ancient historyThe chevron occurs in early art including designs on pottery and rock carvings.  Examples can be found approximately 1800 BC in archaeological recovery of pottery designs from the palace of Knossos on Crete in the modern day country of Greece. 

Exception handling<====>59231<====>Exception handlingException handling  is the process of responding to the occurrence, during computation, of exceptions – anomalous or exceptional conditions requiring special processing – often changing the normal flow of program execution.  It is provided by specialized programming language constructs, computer hardware mechanisms like interrupts or operating system IPC facilities like signals. In general, an exception breaks the normal flow of execution and executes a pre-registered exception handler.  The details of how this is done depends on whether it is a hardware or software exception and how the software exception is implemented.  Some exceptions, especially hardware ones, may be handled so gracefully that execution can resume where it was interrupted.

Set (deity)<====>59236<====>Set (deity)   Set   or Seth   (Egyptian: stẖ; also transliterated Setesh, Sutekh , Setekh, or Suty) is a god of the desert, storms, disorder, violence, and foreigners in ancient Egyptian religion.  Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt, vol.  3, p.  269  In Ancient Greek, the god's name is given as Sēth (Σήθ).  Set had a positive role where he accompanies Ra on his solar boat to repel Apep, the serpent of Chaos.   Set had a vital role as a reconciled combatant.   He was lord of the red (desert) land where he was the balance to Horus' role as lord of the black (soil) land. 

Entomology<====>59238<====>Entomology Entomology (    ) is the scientific study of insects, a branch of zoology.  In the past the term "insect" was more vague, and historically the definition of entomology included the study of terrestrial animals in other arthropod groups or other phyla, such as arachnids, myriapods, earthworms, land snails, and slugs.  This wider meaning may still be encountered in informal use. Like several of the other fields that are categorized within zoology, entomology is a taxon-based category; any form of scientific study in which there is a focus on insect-related inquiries is, by definition, entomology. 

Amphibole<====>59243<====>Amphibole  Amphibole ( ) is an important group of generally dark-colored,  inosilicate minerals, forming prism or needlelike crystals,  composed of double chain   tetrahedra, linked at the vertices and generally containing ions of iron and/or magnesium in their structures.  Amphiboles can be green, black, colorless, white, yellow, blue, or brown.  The International Mineralogical Association currently classifies amphiboles as a mineral supergroup, within which are two groups and several subgroups.  MineralogyAmphiboles crystallize into two crystal systems, monoclinic and orthorhombic.  In chemical composition and general characteristics they are similar to the pyroxenes.  The chief differences from pyroxenes are that (i) amphiboles contain essential hydroxyl (OH) or halogen (F, Cl) and (ii) the basic structure is a double chain of tetrahedra (as opposed to the single chain structure of pyroxene).

Roundabout<====>59257<====>Roundabout    A roundabout, also called a traffic circle, road circle, rotary, rotunda or island, is a type of circular intersection or junction in which road traffic flows almost continuously in one direction around a central island.  The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Volume 2, Clarendon Press, Oxford (1993), page 2632 So-called "modern" roundabouts require entering traffic to give way to traffic already in the circle and optimally observe various design rules to increase safety.  Compared to stop signs, traffic signals, and earlier forms of roundabouts, modern roundabouts reduce the likelihood and severity of collisions by reducing traffic speeds and minimizing T-bone and head-on collisions. 

Yuan Shikai<====>59259<====>Yuan ShikaiYuan Shikai ( ; 16 September 1859 – 6 June 1916) was a Chinese emperor, general, statesman and warlord, famous for his influence during the late Qing dynasty, his role in the events leading up to the abdication of the last Qing Emperor, his autocratic rule as the first formal President of the Republic of China, and his short-lived attempt to restore monarchy in China, with himself as the Hongxian Emperor ( ). Early lifeYuan Shikai was born in the village of Zhangying (張營村), Xiangcheng County, Chenzhou Prefecture, Henan, though the clan later moved 16 kilometers southeast of Xiangcheng to a hilly area that was easier to defend.

Semicolon<====>59351<====>Semicolon  The semicolon or semi-colon  (;) is a punctuation mark that separates major sentence elements.  A semicolon can be used between two closely related independent clauses, provided they are not already joined by a coordinating conjunction.

The term mycorrhiza refers to the role of the fungi in the plants' rhizosphere, its root system.  Mycorrhizae play important roles in soil biology and soil chemistry. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus colonizes the host plant's root tissues, either intracellularly as in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF or AM), or extracellularly as in ectomycorrhizal fungi.  The association is generally mutualistic, but in particular species or in particular circumstances, mycorrhizae may be variously pathogenic in the host plants.

Q code<====>59373<====>Q code The Q code is a standardized collection of three-letter codes all of which start with the letter "Q".  It is an operating signal initially developed for commercial radiotelegraph communication and later adopted by other radio services, especially amateur radio.  To distinguish the use of "Q" codes transmitted as questions from those transmitted as statements, operators used the Morse question "INT" (dit dit dah dit dah) as a prefix to the "Q" code.  Although Q codes were created when radio used Morse code exclusively, they continued to be employed after the introduction of voice transmissions.  To avoid confusion, transmitter call signs are restricted; no country is ever issued an ITU prefix starting with "Q". 

Ethnic origin<====>59374<====>Ethnic origin The concept of ethnic origin is an attempt to classify people, not according to their current nationality, but according to commonalities in their social background.

Dorchester County, Maryland<====>59381<====>Dorchester County, Maryland  Dorchester County is a county located in the U. S.  state of Maryland.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 32,618.Its county seat is Cambridge. The county was formed in 1669 and named for the Earl of Dorset, a family friend of the Calverts (the founding family of the Maryland colony).  Dorchester County comprises the Cambridge, MD Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Washington-Baltimore-Arlington, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA Combined Statistical Area.  It is located on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Dorchester County is the largest county on the Eastern Shore. 

Kent County, Maryland<====>59382<====>Kent County, Maryland Kent County is a county located in the U. S.  state of Maryland.  As of the 2010 census, its population was 20,197,    making it the least populous county in Maryland.  Its county seat is Chestertown.The county was named for the county of Kent in England.   The county is located on Maryland's Eastern Shore. HistoryIn 1642, the governor and council appointed commissioners for the Isle and County of Kent.  This act appears to have led to the establishment of Kent County.  In 1675, the first county seat was New Yarmouth.

He is a professor at the University of Western Ontario and Chair for Policy in the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction.   Previously he was the Assistant Deputy Minister of Meteorological Service of Canada. In 1995, McBean gave a speech to the World Meteorological Organization on global warming. In 2006, McBean, with Andrew Weaver and Ken Denman, authored an open letter, signed by 90 climate scientists, to Prime Minister Stephen Harper calling for an effective national climate change strategy. 

Amanita muscaria<====>59385<====>Amanita muscaria    Amanita muscaria, commonly known as the fly agaric or fly amanita, is a basidiomycete mushroom, one of many in the genus Amanita.  It is also a muscimol mushroom.  Native throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, Amanita muscaria has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, generally as a symbiont with pine and birch plantations, and is now a true cosmopolitan species.  It associates with various deciduous and coniferous trees. Arguably the most iconic toadstool species, the fly agaric is a large white-gilled, white-spotted, usually red mushroom, and is one of the most recognisable and widely encountered in popular culture. 

Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences<====>59386<====>Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric SciencesThe Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences (CFCAS) was Canada's main funding body for university-based research on climate, atmospheric and related oceanic work.  It is now the Canadian Climate Forum.  As an autonomous, charitable foundation established in 2000, CFCAS funded research that improved the scientific understanding of processes and predictions, provided relevant science to policy makers and improved understanding of the ways in which these challenges affect human health and the natural environment in addition to strengthening Canada's scientific capacity.   Its chair is Gordon McBean. CFCAS fosters partnerships in support of innovation, investment, policy, skills development and service delivery. 

Morphing<====>59391<====>Morphing Morphing is a special effect in motion pictures and animations that changes (or morphs) one image or shape into another through a seamless transition.  Most often it is used to depict one person turning into another through technological means or as part of a fantasy or surreal sequence.  Traditionally such a depiction would be achieved through cross-fading techniques on film.  Since the early 1990s, this has been replaced by computer software to create more realistic transitions. Early transformation techniquesLong before digital morphing several techniques were used for similar image transformations.  Some are closer to a matched dissolve - a gradual change between two pictures without warping the shapes in the images - while others did change the shapes in between the start and end phases of the transformation. 

Surface anatomy<====>59392<====>Surface anatomySurface anatomy (also called superficial anatomy and visual anatomy) is the study of the external features of the body of an animal.  Seeley (2003) chap. 1 p. 2  In birds this is termed topography.  Surface anatomy deals with anatomical features that can be studied by sight, without dissection.  As such, it is a branch of gross anatomy, along with endoscopic and radiological anatomy.  Standring (2008) Introduction, Anatomical nomenclature, p. 2  Surface anatomy is a descriptive science.   In particular, in the case of human surface anatomy, these are the form and proportions of the human body and the surface landmarks which correspond to deeper structures hidden from view, both in static pose and in motion. 

Meteorological Service of Canada<====>59393<====>Meteorological Service of Canada The Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC;  ) is a division of Environment and Climate Change Canada, which primarily provides public meteorological information and weather forecasts and warnings of severe weather and other environmental hazards.   MSC also monitors and conducts research on climate, atmospheric science, air quality, water quantities, ice and other environmental issues.  MSC operates a network of radio stations throughout Canada transmitting weather and environmental information 24 hours per day called Weatheradio Canada. There are currently five public weather forecast offices:Pacific and Yukon Storm Prediction Centre in Vancouver, British ColumbiaPrairie and Arctic Storm Prediction Centre, split between an office in Edmonton, Alberta and Winnipeg, ManitobaOntario Storm Prediction Centre (Downsview, Ontario)Quebec Storm Prediction Centre (Montreal, Quebec)Atlantic Storm Prediction Centre (Dartmouth, Nova Scotia). 

Haijin<====>59394<====>Haijin  The Haijin or sea ban was a series of related isolationist Chinese policies restricting private maritime trading and coastal settlement during most of the Ming dynasty and some of the Qing.  First imposed to deal with Japanese piracy amid the mopping up of Yuan partisans, the sea ban was completely counterproductive: by the 16th century, piracy and smuggling were endemic and mostly consisted of Chinese who had been dispossessed by the policy.  China's foreign trade was limited to irregular and expensive tribute missions, and resistance even to them among the Chinese bureaucracy led to the scrapping of Zheng He's fleets. 

Reggie Jackson<====>59396<====>Reggie Jackson   Reginald Martinez "Reggie" Jackson (born May 18, 1946) is an American former professional baseball right fielder who played 21 seasons for the Kansas City / Oakland Athletics, Baltimore Orioles, New York Yankees, and California Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB).  Jackson was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1993. Jackson was nicknamed "Mr.  October" for his clutch hitting in the postseason with the Athletics and the Yankees.He helped Oakland win five consecutive American League West divisional pennants, three consecutive American League pennants and three consecutive World Series titles, from 1971 to 1975. 

Lumber<====>59399<====>Lumber  Lumber (American English; used only in North America) or timber (used in the rest of the English speaking world) is a type of wood that has been processed into beams and planks, a stage in the process of wood production.  Lumber is mainly used for structural purposes but has many other uses as well. There are two main types of lumber.  It may be supplied either rough-sawn, or surfaced on one or more of its faces.  Besides pulpwood, rough lumber is the raw material for furniture-making and other items requiring additional cutting and shaping.  It is available in many species, usually hardwoods; but it is also readily available in softwoods, such as white pine and red pine, because of their low cost. 

Rust (fungus)<====>59400<====>Rust (fungus) Rusts are plant diseases caused by pathogenic fungi of the order Pucciniales (previously also known as Uredinales). An estimated 168 rust genera and approximately 7000 species, more than half of which belong to the genus Puccinia, are currently accepted.   Rust fungi are highly specialized plant pathogens with several unique features.  Taken as a group, rust fungi are diverse and affect many kinds of plants.  However, each species has a very narrow range of hosts and cannot be transmitted to non-host plants.  In addition, most rust fungi can not easily be grown in pure culture. 

Binghamton, New York<====>59403<====>Binghamton, New York {{Infobox settlement   }}Binghamton   is a city in, and the county seat of, Broome County, New York, United States. It lies in the state's Southern Tier region near the Pennsylvania border, in a bowl-shaped valley at the confluence of the Susquehanna and Chenango Rivers. Binghamton is the principal city and cultural center of the Binghamton metropolitan area (also known as Greater Binghamton, or historically the Triple Cities), home to a quarter million people.The population of the city itself, according to the 2010 census, is 47,376. 

Initial and terminal objects<====>59405<====>Initial and terminal objects  In category theory, a branch of mathematics, an initial object of a category C is an object I in C such that for every object X in C, there exists precisely one morphism I → X. The dual notion is that of a terminal object (also called terminal element): T is terminal if for every object X in C there exists a single morphism X → T.  Initial objects are also called coterminal or universal, and terminal objects are also called final. If an object is both initial and terminal, it is called a zero object or null object. 

Pea<====>59407<====>Pea   The pea is most commonly the small spherical seed or the seed-pod of the pod fruit Pisum sativum.  Each pod contains several peas.  Pea pods are botanically fruit,  since they contain seeds and developed from the ovary of a (pea) flower.  The name is also used to describe other edible seeds from the Fabaceae such as the pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), the cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and the seeds from several species of Lathyrus. P.  sativum is an annual plant, with a life cycle of one year.  It is a cool-season crop grown in many parts of the world; planting can take place from winter to early summer depending on location. 

Pedology<====>59408<====>Pedology Pedology (from Greek: πέδον, pedon, "soil"; and λόγος, logos, "study") is the study of soils in their natural environment.   It is one of two main branches of soil science, the other being edaphology.  Pedology deals with pedogenesis, soil morphology, and soil classification, while edaphology studies the way soils influence plants, fungi, and other living things. OverviewSoil is not only a support for vegetation, but it is also the pedosphere, the locus of numerous interactions between climate (water, air, temperature), soil life (micro-organisms, plants, animals) and its residues,  the mineral material of the original and added rock, and its position in the landscape. 

Measure for Measure<====>59411<====>Measure for MeasureMeasure for Measure is a play by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written in 1603 or 1604.  Originally published in the First Folio of 1623, where it was listed as a comedy, the play's first recorded performance occurred in 1604.  The play's main themes include justice, "mortality and mercy in Vienna," and the dichotomy between corruption and purity: "some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall. " Mercy and virtue prevail, as the play does not end tragically, with virtues such as compassion and forgiveness being exercised at the end of the production. 

Syriac language<====>59412<====>Syriac language    Syriac   (   ), also known as Syriac Aramaic or Classical Syriac,   is a dialect of Middle Aramaic that is the minority language of indigenous ethnic Assyrians/Syriacs in south eastern Turkey, northern Iraq, northeastern Syria and North western Iran.  It is also the liturgical language of several churches, in particular the Assyrian Church of the East, Syriac Orthodox Church, Chaldean Catholic Church and Maronite Church. Emerging in 5th century BC Assyria, it was once spoken across much of the Near East as well as Asia Minor and Eastern Arabia. 

Soil science<====>59413<====>Soil science  Soil science is the study of soil as a natural resource on the surface of the Earth including soil formation, classification and mapping; physical, chemical, biological, and fertility properties of soils; and these properties in relation to the use and management of soils.  Sometimes terms which refer to branches of soil science, such as pedology (formation, chemistry, morphology, and classification of soil) and edaphology (how soils interact with living things, especially plants), are used as if synonymous with soil science.   The diversity of names associated with this discipline is related to the various associations concerned. 

Nitrogen cycle<====>59414<====>Nitrogen cycleThe nitrogen cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which nitrogen is converted into multiple chemical forms as it circulates among the atmosphere, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems.  The conversion of nitrogen can be carried out through both biological and physical processes.  Important processes in the nitrogen cycle include fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification.  The majority of Earth's atmosphere (78%) is nitrogen,    making it the largest source of nitrogen.  However, atmospheric nitrogen has limited availability for biological use, leading to a scarcity of usable nitrogen in many types of ecosystems.  The nitrogen cycle is of particular interest to ecologists because nitrogen availability can affect the rate of key ecosystem processes, including primary production and decomposition. 

Soil erosion<====>59416<====>Soil erosionSoil erosion is the displacement of the upper layer of soil, one form of soil degradation.  A low level of erosion of soil is a naturally occurring process on all land.  The agents of soil erosion are water and wind, each contributing a significant amount of soil loss each year.  Soil erosion may be a slow process that continues relatively unnoticed, or it may occur at an alarming rate causing a serious loss of topsoil.  The loss of soil from farmland may be reflected in reduced crop production potential, lower surface water quality and damaged drainage networks. 

Amoco<====>59418<====>Amoco  Amoco Corporation, originally Standard Oil Company (Indiana), is a global chemical and oil company that was founded in 1889 around a refinery located in Whiting, Indiana, United States. It later absorbed the American Oil Company, founded in Baltimore in 1910 and incorporated in 1922 by Louis Blaustein and his son Jacob.  Amoco merged with British Petroleum in December 1998, forming BP Amoco.  Shortly after the merger, Amoco stations began a rebranding that saw the stations change their names to the BP marque while continuing to sell Amoco-branded fuel.  Eventually all traces of the Amoco brand name were eliminated and the stations adopted the BP branding permanently, although Amoco's grade naming system is still in use. 

ARCO<====>59428<====>ARCO  Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) is an American oil company with operations in the United States, Indonesia, the North Sea, the South China Sea and Mexico. It has more than 1,300 gas stations in the western part of the United States  , and recently (as of 2017) 5 gas stations at northwestern Mexico  .   ARCO was formed by the merger of East Coast–based Atlantic Refining and California-based Richfield Oil Corporation in 1966.  A merger in 1969 brought in Sinclair Oil Corporation.    It became a subsidiary of UK-based BP plc in 2000 through its BP West Coast Products LLC (BPWCP) affiliate. 

Standard Oil of Ohio<====>59429<====>Standard Oil of Ohio Standard Oil of Ohio or Sohio was an American oil company, and the earliest component of the original Standard Oil company founded by John D.  Rockefeller.   Sohio was acquired by British Petroleum, now called BP. Sohio continued as a separate entity after the antitrust breakup of Standard Oil in 1911.  It operated service stations under the "Sohio" brand name in Ohio.  In other states, it used the "Boron" brand name instead, but with an otherwise-similar  logo.  Wallace Trevor Holliday was President of the company from 1928 to 1949 and Chairman of the Board from 1949 until his death on November 7, 1950. 

Pange Lingua Gloriosi Corporis Mysterium<====>59434<====>Pange Lingua Gloriosi Corporis Mysterium Pange Lingua Gloriosi Corporis Mysterium is a Medieval Latin hymn written by Saint Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) for the Feast of Corpus Christi.  It is also sung on Maundy Thursday during the procession from the church to the place where the Blessed Sacrament is kept until Good Friday.  The last two stanzas (called, separately, Tantum Ergo) are sung at Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament.  The hymn expresses the doctrine that the bread and wine are changed into the Body and Blood of Christ during the celebration of the Eucharist. It is often sung in English as the hymn Of the Glorious Body Telling, to the same tune as the Latin. 

Thermal conductivity<====>59438<====>Thermal conductivity Thermal conductivity (often denoted k, λ, or κ) is the property of a material to conduct heat.  It is evaluated primarily in terms of Fourier's Law for heat conduction. Heat transfer occurs at a lower rate across materials of low thermal conductivity than across materials of high thermal conductivity.  Correspondingly, materials of high thermal conductivity are widely used in heat sink applications and materials of low thermal conductivity are used as thermal insulation.  The thermal conductivity of a material may depend on temperature.  The reciprocal of thermal conductivity is called thermal resistivity. Thermal conductivity is actually a tensor, which means it is possible to have different values in different directions. 

DLL Hell<====>59441<====>DLL HellIn computing, DLL Hell is a term for the complications that arise when working with dynamic link libraries (DLLs) used with Microsoft Windows operating systems,  particularly legacy 16-bit editions which all run in a single memory space. DLL Hell can manifest itself in many different ways in which applications do not launch or work correctly. DLL Hell is the Windows ecosystem-specific form of the general concept dependency hell. ProblemsDLLs are Microsoft's implementation of shared libraries.  Shared libraries allow common code to be bundled into a wrapper, the DLL, and used by any application software on the system without loading multiple copies into memory. 

Baryte<====>59442<====>Baryte Baryte or barite (BaSO 4 ) is a mineral consisting of barium sulfate.    The baryte group consists of baryte, celestine, anglesite and anhydrite.  Baryte is generally white or colorless, and is the main source of barium.  Baryte and celestine form a solid solution (Ba,Sr)SO 4 .  Names and historyThe radiating form, sometimes referred to as Bologna Stone, attained some notoriety among alchemists for the phosphorescent specimens found in the 17th century near Bologna by Vincenzo Casciarolo.  The American Petroleum Institute specification API 13/ISO 13500, which governs baryte for drilling purposes, does not refer to any specific mineral, but rather a material that meets that specification. 

Energy level<====>59444<====>Energy level   A quantum mechanical system or particle that is bound—that is, confined spatially—can only take on certain discrete values of energy.  This contrasts with classical particles, which can have any energy.  These discrete values are called energy levels.  The term is commonly used for the energy levels of electrons in atoms, ions, or molecules, which are bound by the electric field of the nucleus, but can also refer to energy levels of nuclei or vibrational or rotational energy levels in molecules.  The energy spectrum of a system with such discrete energy levels is said to be quantized. 

Celestine (mineral)<====>59446<====>Celestine (mineral)  Celestine or celestite  is a mineral consisting of strontium sulfate (SrSO 4 ).  The mineral is named for its occasional delicate blue color.  Celestine is the principal source of the element strontium, commonly used in fireworks and in various metal alloys. EtymologyCelestine derives its name from the Latin word caelestis meaning celestial,  which in turn is derived from the Latin word caelum meaning sky or heaven.  OccurrenceCelestine occurs as crystals, and also in compact massive and fibrous forms.  It is mostly found in sedimentary rocks, often associated with the minerals gypsum, anhydrite, and halite. 

The West Wing<====>59449<====>The West Wing   The West Wing is  an American serial political drama television series created by Aaron Sorkin that was originally broadcast on NBC from September 22, 1999, to May 14, 2006.   The series is set primarily in the West Wing of the White House, where the Oval Office and offices of presidential senior staff are located, during the fictitious Democratic administration of Josiah Bartlet (played by Martin Sheen). The West Wing was produced by Warner Bros.  Television.  For the first four seasons, there were three executive producers: Aaron Sorkin (lead writer of almost all of the first four seasons); Thomas Schlamme (primary director); and John Wells. 

Strontianite<====>59450<====>Strontianite Strontianite (SrCO 3 ) is an important raw material for the extraction of strontium.  It is a rare carbonate mineral and one of only a few strontium minerals.   It is a member of the aragonite group. Aragonite group members:  aragonite (CaCO 3 ), witherite (BaCO 3 ), strontianite (SrCO 3 ), cerussite (PbCO 3 )The ideal formula of strontianite is SrCO 3 , with molar mass 147. 63 g,  but calcium (Ca) can substitute for up to 27% of the strontium (Sr) cations, and barium (Ba) up to 3. 3%.  The mineral was named in 1791 for the locality, Strontian, Argyllshire, Scotland, where the element strontium had been discovered the previous year. 

Spanish missions in California<====>59453<====>Spanish missions in California  The Spanish missions in California comprise a series of 21 religious outposts or missions established between 1769 and 1833 in today's U. S.  State of California.  Founded by Catholic priests of the Franciscan order to evangelize the Native Americans, the missions led to the creation of the New Spain province of Alta California and were part of the expansion of the Spanish Empire into the most northern and western parts of Spanish North America.  Following long-term secular and religious policy of Spain in Latin America, the missionaries forced the native Californians to live in settlements called reductions, disrupting their traditional way of life. 

Hydrate<====>59456<====>Hydrate In chemistry, a hydrate is a substance that contains water or its constituent elements.  The chemical state of the water varies widely between different classes of hydrates, some of which were so labeled before their chemical structure was understood. Chemical natureOrganic chemistryIn organic chemistry, a hydrate is a compound formed by the addition of water or its elements to another molecule.  For example: ethanol, CH 3 –CH 2 –OH, is the product of the hydration reaction of ethene, CH 2 =CH 2 , formed by the addition of H to one C and OH to the other C, and so can be considered as the hydrate of ethene. 

ElGamal encryption<====>59458<====>ElGamal encryption In cryptography, the ElGamal encryption system is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm for public-key cryptography which is based on the Diffie–Hellman key exchange.  The system provides an additional layer of security by asymmetrically encrypting keys previously used for symmetric message encryption.  It was described by Taher Elgamal in 1985.   ElGamal encryption is used in the free GNU Privacy Guard software, recent versions of PGP, and other cryptosystems.  The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is a variant of the ElGamal signature scheme, which should not be confused with ElGamal encryption. ElGamal encryption can be defined over any cyclic group  G . 

Rabbinic literature<====>59459<====>Rabbinic literature   Rabbinic literature, in its broadest sense, can mean the entire spectrum of rabbinic writings throughout Jewish history.  However, the term often refers specifically to literature from the Talmudic era, as opposed to medieval and modern rabbinic writing, and thus corresponds with the Hebrew term Sifrut Hazal (  "Literature [of our] sages," where Hazal normally refers only to the sages of the Talmudic era).  This more specific sense of "Rabbinic literature"—referring to the Talmudim, Midrash ( ), and related writings, but hardly ever to later texts—is how the term is generally intended when used in contemporary academic writing. 

Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst<====>59465<====>Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst    Field Marshal Jeffery  Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst,   (29 January 1717 – 3 August 1797) served as an officer in the British Army and as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces. Amherst is best known as the architect of Britain's successful campaign to conquer the territory of New France during the Seven Years' War.  Under his command, British forces captured the cities of Louisbourg, Quebec City and Montreal, as well as several major fortresses.  He was also the first British Governor General in the territories that eventually became Canada.  Numerous places and streets are named for him, in both Canada and the United States. 

Cabaret<====>59467<====>Cabaret Cabaret ( ) is a form of entertainment featuring music, song, dance, recitation, or drama.  It is mainly distinguished by the performance venue, which might be a pub, a restaurant or a nightclub with a stage for performances.  The audience, often dining or drinking, does not typically dance but usually sits at tables.  Performances are usually introduced by a master of ceremonies or MC.  The entertainment, as done by an ensemble of actors and according to its European origins, is often (but not always) oriented towards adult audiences and of a clearly underground nature.  In the United States striptease, burlesque, drag shows, or a solo vocalist with a pianist, as well as the venues which offer this entertainment, are often advertised as cabarets. 

Linear cryptanalysis<====>59469<====>Linear cryptanalysis In cryptography, linear cryptanalysis is a general form of cryptanalysis based on finding affine approximations to the action of a cipher.  Attacks have been developed for block ciphers and stream ciphers.  Linear cryptanalysis is one of the two most widely used attacks on block ciphers; the other being differential cryptanalysis. The discovery is attributed to Mitsuru Matsui, who first applied the technique to the FEAL cipher (Matsui and Yamagishi, 1992).Subsequently, Matsui published an attack on the Data Encryption Standard (DES), eventually leading to the first experimental cryptanalysis of the cipher reported in the open community (Matsui, 1993; 1994). 

Digital Signature Algorithm<====>59470<====>Digital Signature Algorithm The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is a Federal Information Processing Standard for digital signatures.  In August 1991 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposed DSA for use in their Digital Signature Standard (DSS) and adopted it as FIPS 186 in 1993. Four revisions to the initial specification have been released: FIPS 186-1 in 1996,    FIPS 186-2 in 2000,    FIPS 186-3 in 2009,    and FIPS 186-4 in 2013.    DSA is covered by  , filed July 26, 1991 and attributed to David W. 

Chesapeake Bay<====>59473<====>Chesapeake Bay The Chesapeake Bay (   ) is an estuary in the U. S.  states of Maryland, Delaware, District of Columbia,  and Virginia, lying inland from the Atlantic Ocean and surrounded to the west by the North American mainland and to the east by the Delmarva Peninsula.It is the largest estuary in North America.   With its northern portion in Maryland and the southern part in Virginia, the Chesapeake Bay is a very important feature for the ecology and economy of those two states, as well as others.  More than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the Bay's   drainage basin, which covers parts of six states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia) and all of Washington, D. 

Monophysitism<====>59474<====>Monophysitism   Monophysitism (  or  ; Greek: μονοφυσιτισμός; Late Koine Greek   from μόνος monos, "only, single" and φύσις physis, "nature") is the Christological position that, after the union of the divine and the human in the historical Incarnation, Jesus Christ, as the incarnation of the eternal Son or Word (Logos) of God, had only a single "nature" which was either divine or a synthesis of divine and human.  Monophysitism is contrasted to dyophysitism (or dia-, dio-, or duophysitism) which maintains that Christ maintained two natures, one divine and one human, after the Incarnation. Historically, Monophysitism (usually capitalized in this sense) refers primarily to the position of those (especially in Egypt and to a lesser extent Syria) who rejected the Council of Chalcedon (the fourth ecumenical [worldwide] council), in 451. 

Monothelitism<====>59475<====>Monothelitism  Monothelitism or monotheletism (from Greek μονοθελητισμός "doctrine of one will") is a particular teaching about how the divine and human relate in the person of Jesus, known as a Christological doctrine, that formally emerged in Armenia and Syria in 629.  Bury, pg 251  Specifically, monothelitism is the view that Jesus Christ has two natures but only one will.  This is contrary to the Christology that Jesus Christ has two wills (human and divine) corresponding to his two natures (dyothelitism).  Monothelitism is a development of the Neo-chalcedonian position in the Christological debates.  Formulated in 638, it enjoyed considerable popularity, even garnering patriarchal support, before being rejected and denounced as heretical in 681 at the Third Council of Constantinople. 

Chalcedonian Christianity<====>59477<====>Chalcedonian Christianity  Chalcedonian Christianity is the Christian denominations adhering to christological definitions and ecclesiological resolutions of the Council of Chalcedon, the Fourth Ecumenical Council held in 451.   Chalcedonian Christians follow the Definition of Chalcedon, a religious doctrine concerning the divine and human natures of Jesus Christ.  The great majority of Christian communions and confessions in the 21st century are Chalcedonian, but from the 5th to the 8th centuries the ascendancy of Chalcedonian Christology (detailed below) was not always certain. HistoryThe dogmatical disputes raised during the Council of Chalcedon led to the Chalcedonian Schism thus to the formation of the Non-Chalcedonian body of churches known as Oriental Orthodoxy. 

Presidio of San Francisco<====>59480<====>Presidio of San Francisco{{Infobox settlement }} The Presidio of San Francisco (originally, El Presidio Real de San Francisco or The Royal Fortress of Saint Francis) is a park and former U. S.  Army military fort on the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula in San Francisco, California, and is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. It had been a fortified location since September 17, 1776, when New Spain established it to gain a foothold in Alta California and the San Francisco Bay.  It passed to Mexico, which in turn passed it to the United States in 1848. 

Carl Wilhelm Scheele<====>59483<====>Carl Wilhelm Scheele Carl Wilhelm Scheele ( ,  ; 9 December 1742 – 21 May 1786) was a Swedish Pomeranian and German pharmaceutical chemist.  Isaac Asimov called him "hard-luck Scheele" because he made a number of chemical discoveries before others who are generally given the credit.   For example, Scheele discovered oxygen (although Joseph Priestley published his findings first), and identified molybdenum, tungsten, barium, hydrogen, and chlorine before Humphry Davy, among others.  Scheele discovered organic acids tartaric, oxalic, uric, lactic, and citric, as well as hydrofluoric, hydrocyanic, and arsenic acids.   He preferred speaking German to Swedish his whole life, as German was commonly spoken among Swedish pharmacists.

Fireworks<====>59493<====>Fireworks    Fireworks are a class of low explosive pyrotechnic devices used for aesthetic and entertainment purposes.  The most common use of a firework is as part of a fireworks display (also called a fireworks show or pyrotechnics), a display of the effects produced by firework devices.  Fireworks competitions are also regularly held at a number of places. Fireworks take many forms to produce the four primary effects: noise, light, smoke, and floating  materials (confetti for example).  They may be designed to burn with colored flames and sparks including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and silver. 

Method acting<====>59495<====>Method acting Method acting is a range of training and rehearsal techniques that seek to encourage sincere and emotionally expressive performances, as formulated by a number of different theatre practitioners, principally in the United States, where it is among the most popular—and controversial—approaches to acting.  Krasner (2000b, 129).   These techniques are built on the Stanislavski's system developed by the Russian actor and director Konstantin Stanislavski.  Though many have contributed to the development of the Method, three teachers are associated with "having set the standard of its success", though each emphasized different aspects of the approach: Lee Strasberg (the psychological aspects), Stella Adler (the sociological aspects), and Sanford Meisner (the behavioral aspects). 

Solubility<====>59497<====>Solubility  Solubility is the property of a solid, liquid, or gaseous chemical substance called solute to dissolve in a solid, liquid, or gaseous solvent.  The solubility of a substance fundamentally depends on the physical and chemical properties of the solute and solvent as well as on temperature, pressure and  the pH of the solution.  The extent of the solubility of a substance in a specific solvent is measured as the saturation concentration, where adding more solute does not increase the concentration of the solution and begins to precipitate the excess amount of solute.  The solubility of a substance is an entirely different property from the rate of solution, which is how fast it dissolves.

Bioaccumulation<====>59503<====>BioaccumulationBioaccumulation is the accumulation of substances, such as pesticides, or other chemicals in an organism.   Bioaccumulation occurs when an organism absorbs a substance at a rate faster than that at which the substance is lost by catabolism and excretion.  Thus, the longer the biological half-life of a toxic substance, the greater the risk of chronic poisoning, even if environmental levels of the toxin are not very high.   Bioaccumulation, for example in fish, can be predicted by models.    Hypotheses for molecular size cutoff criteria for use as bioaccumulation potential indicators are not supported by data. 

Gemara<====>59506<====>Gemara   The Gemara (also transliterated Gemora, Gemarah, or, less commonly, Gemorra;  from Hebrew  , from the Aramaic verb gamar, study) is the component of the Talmud comprising rabbinical analysis of and commentary on the Mishnah.  After the Mishnah was published by Judah the Prince (c.  200 CE), the work was studied exhaustively by generation after generation of rabbis in Babylonia and the Land of Israel.  Their discussions were written down in a series of books that became the Gemara, which when combined with the Mishnah constituted the Talmud. There are two versions of the Gemara. 

List of United States federal legislation<====>59508<====>List of United States federal legislation  This is a chronological, but still incomplete, list of United States federal legislation.  Congress has enacted approximately 200–600 statutes during each of its 115 biennial terms, so that more than 20,000 statutes have been enacted since 1789. At the federal level in the United States, legislation (i. e. , "statutes" or "statutory law") consists exclusively of Acts passed by the Congress of the United States and its predecessor, the Continental Congress, that were either signed into law by the President or passed by Congress after a presidential veto. Legislation is not the only source of regulations with the force of law. 

Russians<====>59510<====>Russians    Russians ( , russkiye) are an East Slavic ethnic group native to Eastern Europe.  The majority of Russians inhabit the nation state of Russia,   while notable minorities exist in other former Soviet states such as Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and the Baltic states.  A large Russian diaspora also exists all over the world, with notable numbers in the United States, Germany, Israel, and Canada.  Russians are the most numerous ethnic group in Europe. The Russians share many cultural traits with their fellow East Slavic counterparts, specifically Belarusians and Ukrainians as well as with Eastern South Slavs such as Bulgarians, Macedonians, Montenegrins and Serbs. 

United Kingdom legislation<====>59511<====>United Kingdom legislation  The United Kingdom legislation derives from a number of different sources.  The Parliament of the United Kingdom  is the supreme legislative body for the United Kingdom, the British Crown dependencies and the British overseas territories.  Each of the three major jurisdictions of the United Kingdom (England and Wales, Scotland  and Northern Ireland) also has its own laws and the legal system. Modern sources of legislationThe Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (commonly known as the UK Parliament, the British Parliament, the Westminster Parliament or "Westminster") is the supreme legislative body for the United Kingdom. 

Serbs<====>59512<====>Serbs The Serbs (  /  ,  ) are a South Slavic ethnic group that formed in the Balkans.   The majority of Serbs inhabit the nation state of Serbia (with a minority in disputed Kosovo), as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Croatia.  They form significant minorities in Macedonia and Slovenia.  There is a large Serb diaspora in Western Europe, and outside Europe there are significant communities in North America and Australia. The Serbs share many cultural traits with the rest of the peoples of Southeast Europe.  They are predominantly Eastern Orthodox Christians by religion. 

European Communities Act 1972 (UK)<====>59517<====>European Communities Act 1972 (UK) The European Communities Act 1972 (c. 68) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which legislated for the accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities (EC) – the collective term for the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the European Economic Community (EEC) (also known at the time as the "Common Market") and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC) (also known as Euratom) – through the Treaty of Accession which was signed by then Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath and the then President of the European Commission Franco Maria Malfatti on 22 January 1972 in Brussels and ratified by the United Kingdom though the Act. All three of these institutions would later form part of what is now known as the European Union.The act also legislated for the incorporation of European Union law (then Community law) along with the jurisdiction and judgements from the European Court of Justice into the domestic law of the United Kingdom, and is binding on all legislation passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the devolved administrations in the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales. It was the most significant Act of Parliament to be passed by the Heath government of 1970-74 and is one of the most significant constitutional pieces of legislation ever passed.The act is significantly amended from its original form as it also incorporates through amending Acts of Parliament the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty which formed the European Union, the Amsterdam Treaty, the Nice Treaty, and most recently the Treaty of Lisbon, into the domestic law of the United Kingdom.On 13 July 2017, Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill which would repeal the 1972 Act.Origin and background On 28 October 1971, after a year of negotiations between the UK Government led by the Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath, the European Communities and various European leaders (particularly the French President Georges Pompidou), Members of Parliament after six days of debate in the House of Commons voted 356-244, a majority of 112 in favour of the principle of the United Kingdom becoming a member state of the European Communities (the Common Market) on the terms which had been provisionally agreed. This led to Edward Heath signing the Treaty of Accession in Brussels on behalf of the United Kingdom on 22 January 1972, with the treaty having full legal effect from 1 January 1973.For the Treaty to have full legal effect upon entry into the Communities on 1 January 1973, and for the United Kingdom to incorporate the European Institutions and the laws of the Communities, an Act of Parliament was required to be passed to give this effect and on 25 January – three days after the signing of the Treaty – a European Communities Bill was presented to the House of Commons by Geoffrey Rippon for its first reading. The Bill itself contained just 12 clauses and was criticised by some in the opposition who had initially demanded a one thousand clause Bill at the time as it would be much harder to amend.Second Reading (House of Commons)On 17 February 1972, the House of Commons voted narrowly by 309-301 in favour of the Bill at its second reading after three days of intense debate. Just before the vote the Prime Minister Edward Heath argued his case in the debate with the following words. The Bill then passed on to Committee Stage before its third reading.Third Reading (House of Commons)On 13 July 1972 the House of Commons voted 301-284 in favour of the Bill in its third and final reading before passing on to the House of Lords. Before the vote took place, Geoffrey Rippon (who had drafted the Bill) argued in the House of Commons immediately before the vote: The Bill then passed to the House of Lords before receiving Royal Assent.Royal AssentThe Act received Royal Assent on 17 October and UK's instrument of ratification of the Treaty of Accession was deposited the next day athrough the act and the treaty did not become law until 1 January 1973 when the United Kingdom officially became a member state of the European Communities (now the European Union)  along with Denmark and the Republic of Ireland.The ActThe European Communities Act was the instrument whereby the UK was able to join the European Union (then known as the European Communities). It enables, under section 2(2), UK government ministers to lay regulations before Parliament to transpose EU Directives (then Community law) and rulings of the European Court of Justice into UK law. It also provides, in section 2(4), that all UK legislation, including primary legislation (Acts of Parliament) have effect "subject to" directly applicable EU law. This has been interpreted by UK courts as granting EU law primacy over domestic UK legislation.European TreatiesThe Act incorporated the following treaties into the domestic law of the United Kingdom.Treaty of Paris (1951)Treaty of RomeEuratom TreatyMerger TreatyBudgetary Treaty of 1970Treaty of Accession 1972The following treaties were added to the act though subsequent amendments.Single European Act (through the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1986)EEA Agreement (through the European Economic Area Act 1993)Maastricht Treaty (through the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993)Amsterdam Treaty (through the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1998)Treaty of Nice (through the European Communities (Amendment) Act 2002)Treaty of Lisbon (through the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008)Common Agricultural Policy  The Act legislated for the full participation of the United Kingdom in the Common Agricultural Policy and fully incorporates the policy into UK domestic law. It repealed previous pieces of UK domestic legislation to allow for this.Customs Union The Act legislated for the incorporation and full participation of the United Kingdom within the European Union Customs Union (then European Communities Customs Union) into domestic law, as well as the application of the European common external tariff to all goods which come into the UK from outside the European Communities. The Act repealed large sections of previous UK domestic legislation to allow for this.Effect The primacy and direct effect of EU law has no formal basis in the founding treaties of the union but was developed by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), long before UK accession, on the grounds that the purpose of the treaties would be thwarted if EU law were subordinate to national law. The view of the ECJ is that any norm of EU law takes precedence over national law, including national constitutions. Most national courts, including the United Kingdom's, do not accept this monist perspective.    The British constitution is based on Parliamentary sovereignty and has a dualist view of international law: international treaties do not become part of UK domestic law unless they are incorporated into UK law by an Act of Parliament.    The primacy of EU law in the United Kingdom derives from the European Communities Act. This means that if the Act were repealed, any EU law (unless it has been transposed into British legislation) would, in practice, become unenforceable in the United Kingdom and Gibraltar, and the powers delegated by the Act to the EU institutions would return to the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  This was made clear to be the law in the United Kingdom by the inclusion of the "sovereignty clause" in the EU Act 2011 passed by the British Parliament.The question of sovereignty had been discussed in an official document (FCO 30/1048) that became available to the public in January 2002 under the Thirty-year rule. It listed among "Areas of policy in which parliamentary freedom to legislate will be affected by entry into the European Communities": Customs duties, Agriculture, Free movement of labour, services and capital, Transport, and Social Security for migrant workers. The document concluded (paragraph 26) that it was advisable to put the considerations of influence and power before those of formal sovereignty. Factortame In the Factortame case, the House of Lords (Lord Bridge) has interpreted section 2(4) as effectively inserting an implied clause into all UK statutes that they shall not apply where they conflict with European law. This is seen by some as a departure from the British constitutional doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, as traditionally understood. Repeal The United Kingdom voted for withdrawal from the European Union in the 2016 EU referendum held on 23 June 2016, and afterwards there was speculation that the act would be either repealed or amended.  In October 2016 the prime minister, Theresa May, promised a "Great Repeal Bill" which would repeal the 1972 act and import its regulations into UK law, with effect from the date of British withdrawal; the regulations could then be amended or repealed on a case-by-case basis.  The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill was introduced in the House of Commons in July 2017.The Supreme Court ruled in January 2017 that an act of Parliament was needed before the government could invoke   to give notice to leave the European Union.

Preadditive category<====>59521<====>Preadditive categoryIn mathematics, specifically in category theory, a preadditive category is a category that is enriched over the monoidal category of abelian groups.  In other words, the category C is preadditive if every hom-set Hom(A,B) in C has the structure of an abelian group, and composition of morphisms is bilinear, in the sense that composition of morphisms distributes over the group operation.  That is,   f\circ (g + h) = (f\circ g) + (f\circ h) and   (f + g)\circ h = (f\circ h) + (g\circ h), where + is the group operation. A preadditive category is also called an Ab-category, after the notation Ab for the category of abelian groups. 

Next-Generation Secure Computing Base<====>59524<====>Next-Generation Secure Computing BaseThe Next-Generation Secure Computing Base (NGSCB; codenamed Palladium    and also known as Trusted Windows   ) is a cancelled software architecture designed by Microsoft which aimed to provide users of the Windows operating system with better privacy, security, and system integrity.   NGSCB was the result of years of research and development within Microsoft to create a secure computing solution that equaled the security of closed architecture platforms, such as set-top boxes, while simultaneously preserving the backward compatibility, openness, and flexibility of the Windows operating system. The primary stated objective with NGSCB was to "protect software from software. 

Solubility equilibrium<====>59529<====>Solubility equilibriumSolubility equilibrium is a type of dynamic equilibrium that exists when a chemical compound in the solid state is in chemical equilibrium with a solution of that compound.  The solid may dissolve unchanged, with dissociation or with chemical reaction with another constituent of the solvent, such as acid or alkali.  Each type of equilibrium is characterized by a temperature-dependent equilibrium constant.  Solubility equilibria are important in pharmaceutical, environmental and many other scenarios. DefinitionsA solubility equilibrium exists when a chemical compound in the solid state is in chemical equilibrium with a solution of that compound.  The equilibrium is an example of dynamic equilibrium in that some individual molecules migrate between the solid and solution phases such that the rates of dissolution and precipitation are equal to one another.

Lou Reed<====>59533<====>Lou Reed   Lewis Allan Reed (March 2, 1942 – October 27, 2013) was an American musician, singer, songwriter and record producer.   He was the lead guitarist, singer and principal songwriter for the rock band the Velvet Underground, with a solo career that spanned five decades.  The Velvet Underground achieved little commercial success during their existence,    but they are now recognized as one of the most influential bands in rock, underground, experimental, and alternative music.  After leaving the band in 1970, he released 20 solo studio albums.  Reed's second solo album, Transformer (1972), notably produced by David Bowie and arranged by Mick Ronson, with its lead single "Walk on the Wild Side" which peaked at No. 

Papal States<====>59534<====>Papal States    The Papal States, officially the State of the Church ( ,  ;  ), were a series of territories in the Italian Peninsula under the direct sovereign rule of the Pope, from the 8th century until 1870.  They were among the major states of Italy from roughly the 8th century until the Italian Peninsula was unified in 1861 by the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia.  At their zenith, they covered most of the modern Italian regions of Lazio (which includes Rome), Marche, Umbria and Romagna, and portions of Emilia.  These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the temporal power of the pope, as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy. 

Nico<====>59536<====>Nico  Christa Päffgen (16 October 1938 – 18 July 1988),better known by her stage name Nico, was a German singer, songwriter, musician, model, and actress who came to prominence in the 1960s as a Warhol superstar. She is known for her vocals on the Velvet Underground's debut album, The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967), and her work as a solo artist.  She also had roles in several films, including Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita (1960) and Andy Warhol's Chelsea Girls (1966). Early lifeNico was born Christa Päffgen in Cologne.  When she was two years old, she moved with her mother and grandfather to the Spreewald forest outside of Berlin to escape the World War II bombardments of Cologne. 

Hutu<====>59537<====>Hutu   The Hutu  , also known as the Abahutu, are a Bantu ethnic group native to African Great Lakes region of Africa, primarily area now under Burundi and Rwanda.  They mainly live in Rwanda, Burundi, and the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where they form one of the principal population divisions alongside the Tutsi and the Twa. Demographics The Hutu is the largest of the four main population divisions in Burundi and Rwanda.  According to the Central Intelligence Agency, 84% of Rwandans and 85% of Burundians are Hutu, with Tutsis the next largest ethnic group at 15% and 14% of residents in Rwanda and Burundi, respectively. 

Monomorphism<====>59538<====>Monomorphism In the context of abstract algebra or universal algebra, a monomorphism is an injective homomorphism.  A monomorphism from   to   is often denoted with the notation   . In the more general setting of category theory, a monomorphism (also called a monic morphism or a mono) is a left-cancellative morphism, that is, an arrow   such that, for all morphisms  , f \circ g_1 = f \circ g_2 \Rightarrow g_1 = g_2.  Monomorphisms are a categorical generalization of injective functions (also called "one-to-one functions"); in some categories the notions coincide, but monomorphisms are more general, as in the examples below. 

Epimorphism<====>59539<====>Epimorphism In category theory, an epimorphism (also called an epic morphism or, colloquially, an epi) is a morphism f : X → Y that is right-cancellative in the sense that, for all morphisms  , g_1 \circ f = g_2 \circ f \Rightarrow g_1 = g_2.  Epimorphisms are categorical analogues of surjective functions (and in the category of sets the concept corresponds to the surjective functions), but it may not exactly coincide in all contexts; for example, the inclusion   \mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Q}   is a ring-epimorphism.  The dual of an epimorphism is a monomorphism (i. e.  an epimorphism in a category C is a monomorphism in the dual category C op ). 

Vajrayana<====>59541<====>Vajrayana   Vajrayāna, Mantrayāna, Esoteric Buddhism and Tantric Buddhism refer to the various Buddhist traditions of Tantra and "Secret Mantra", which are systems of beliefs and practices that developed in medieval India and spread to Tibet and East Asia under varying names and forms.  In Tibet, Buddhist Tantra is termed Vajrayāna, while in China it is generally known as Tángmì (唐密) or Mìzōng (密宗), and in Japan it is known as Mikkyō. Vajrayāna is usually translated as Diamond Vehicle or Thunderbolt Vehicle, referring to the Vajra, a mythical weapon which is also used as a ritual implement. Founded by Indian Mahāsiddhas, Vajrayāna subscribes to the literature known as the Buddhist Tantras. 

Sagrada Família<====>59545<====>Sagrada FamíliaThe   ( ;  ;  ) is the largest unfinished Roman Catholic church in the world and is located in Barcelona, designed by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926).  Gaudí's work on the building is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site,  and in November 2010 Pope Benedict XVI consecrated and proclaimed it a minor basilica,  as distinct from a cathedral, which must be the seat of a bishop. In 1882, construction of Sagrada Família started under architect Francisco Paula de Villar.  In 1883, when Villar resigned,  Gaudí took over as chief architect, transforming the project with his architectural and engineering style, combining Gothic and curvilinear Art Nouveau forms. 

Dial-up Internet access<====>59546<====>Dial-up Internet access Dial-up Internet access is a form of Internet access that uses the facilities of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) to establish a connection to an Internet service provider (ISP) by dialing a telephone number on a conventional telephone line.  The user's computer or router uses an attached modem to encode and decode information into and from audio frequency signals, respectively.  In 1979, Tom Truscott and Steve Bellovin, graduate students for Duke University, created an early predecessor to dial-up Internet access called the USENET.  The USENET was a UNIX based system that used a dial-up connection to transfer data through telephone modems. 

Art Nouveau<====>59551<====>Art Nouveau   Art Nouveau ( ;  )  is an international style of art, architecture and applied art, especially the decorative arts, that was most popular between 1890 and 1910.    A reaction to the academic art of the 19th century, it was inspired by natural forms and structures, particularly the curved lines of plants and flowers. English uses the French name Art Nouveau (new art).   The style is related to, but not identical with,  styles that emerged in many countries in Europe at about the same time:  in Austria it is known as Secessionsstil after Wiener Secession; in Spanish Modernismo; in Catalan Modernisme; in Czech Secese; in Danish Skønvirke or Jugendstil; in German Jugendstil, Art Nouveau or Reformstil; in Hungarian Szecesszió; in Italian Art Nouveau, Stile Liberty or  Stile floreale; in Norwegian Jugendstil; in Polish Secesja; in Slovak Secesia; in Ukrainian and Russian Модерн (Modern) ; in Swedish and Finnish Jugend. 

Albuminuria<====>59553<====>Albuminuria Albuminuria is a pathological condition wherein the protein albumin is abnormally present in the urine.  It is a type of proteinuria.  Albumin is a major plasma protein (normally circulating in the blood); in healthy people, only trace amounts of it are present in urine, whereas larger amounts occur in the urine of patients with kidney disease.  For a number of reasons, clinical terminology is changing to focus on albuminuria more than proteinuria.  Signs and symptomsIt is usually asymptomatic but whitish foam may appear in urine.  Swelling of the ankles, hands, belly or the face may occur if losses of albumin are significant and produce low serum protein levels (nephrotic syndrome). 

Jesus Christ Superstar<====>59554<====>Jesus Christ Superstar    Jesus Christ Superstar is a 1970 rock opera with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice.  The musical started as a rock opera concept album before its Broadway debut in 1971.  The musical is sung-through, with no spoken dialogue.  The story is loosely based on the Gospels' accounts of the last week of Jesus's life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his disciples in Jerusalem and ending with the crucifixion.  It depicts political and interpersonal struggles between Judas Iscariot and Jesus that are not present in the Bible. 

Languages of Africa<====>59556<====>Languages of Africa The languages of Africa are divided into six major language families:Afroasiatic languages are spread throughout Western Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa and parts of the Sahel. Austronesian languages are spoken in Madagascar. Indo-European languages are spoken in South Africa and Namibia (Afrikaans, English, German) and are used as lingua francas in the former colonies of Britain (English), former colonies of France (French), former colonies of Portugal (Portuguese), former colonies of Spain (Spanish) and the current Spanish territories of Ceuta, Melilla and the Canary Islands (Spanish). Khoe languages are concentrated in the Kalahari Desert of Namibia and Botswana. 

Palau Güell<====>59557<====>Palau Güell The Palau Güell ( ,  ) is a mansion designed by the architect Antoni Gaudí for the industrial tycoon Eusebi Güell and built between 1886 and 1888.  It is situated on the Carrer Nou de la Rambla, in the El Raval neighbourhood of the city of Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain.  It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site "Works of Antoni Gaudí". The home is centered around the main room for entertaining high society guests.  Guests entered the home in horse-drawn carriages through the front iron gates, which featured a parabolic arch and intricate patterns of forged ironwork resembling seaweed and in some parts a horsewhip. 

Pierre Brissaud<====>59558<====>Pierre BrissaudPierre Brissaud (23 December 1885 – 1964) was a French Art Deco illustrator, painter, and engraver whose father was Docteur Edouard Brissaud, a student of Docteur Charcot.  He was born in Paris and trained at  the École des Beaux-Arts and Atelier Fernand Cormon in Montmartre, Paris.  His fellow Cormon students were his brother Jacques, André-Édouard Marty, Charles Martin, Georges Lepape.  Students at the workshop drew, painted and designed wallpaper, furniture and posters.  Earlier, Toulouse-Lautrec, van Gogh, and Henri Matisse had studied and worked there.  His older brother Jacques Brissaud was a portrait and genre painter and his uncle Maurice Boutet de Monvel illustrated the fables of La Fontaine, songbooks for children and a life of Joan of Arc. 

Enterprise Objects Framework<====>59561<====>Enterprise Objects FrameworkThe Enterprise Objects Framework, or more commonly simply EOF, was introduced by NeXT in 1994 as a pioneering object-relational mapping product for its NeXTSTEP and OpenStep development platforms.  EOF abstracts the process of interacting with a relational database, mapping database rows to Java or Objective-C objects.  This largely relieves developers from writing low-level SQL code.  EOF enjoyed some niche success in the mid-1990s among financial institutions who were attracted to the rapid application development advantages of NeXT's object-oriented platform.  Since Apple Inc's merger with NeXT in 1996, EOF has evolved into a fully integrated part of WebObjects, an application server also originally from NeXT. 

Judicial independence<====>59563<====>Judicial independenceJudicial independence is the concept that the judiciary needs to be kept away from the other branches of government.  That is, courts should not be subject to improper influence from the other branches of government, or from private or partisan interests.  Judicial Independence is vital and important to the idea of separation of powers. Different countries deal with the idea of judicial independence through different means of judicial selection, or choosing judges.  One way to promote judicial independence is by granting life tenure or long tenure for judges, which ideally frees them to decide cases and make rulings according to the rule of law and judicial discretion, even if those decisions are politically unpopular or opposed by powerful interests. 

Judiciary<====>59564<====>Judiciary  The judiciary (also known as the judicial system or court system) is the system of courts that interprets and applies the law in the name of the state.   The judiciary also provides a mechanism for the resolution of disputes.  Under the doctrine of the separation of powers, the judiciary generally does not make statutory law (which is the responsibility of the legislature) or enforce law (which is the responsibility of the executive), but rather interprets law and applies it to the facts of each case.  However, the judiciary does make common law, setting precedent for other courts to follow. 

Figure-eight knot (mathematics)<====>59565<====>Figure-eight knot (mathematics)  In knot theory, a figure-eight knot (also called Listing's knot or a Cavendish knot) is the unique knot with a crossing number of four.   This makes it the knot with the third-smallest possible crossing number, after the unknot and the trefoil knot.  The figure-eight knot is a prime knot. Origin of nameThe name is given because tying a normal figure-eight knot in a rope and then joining the ends together, in the most natural way, gives a model of the mathematical knot. DescriptionA simple parametric representation of the figure-eight knot is as the set of all points (x,y,z) where  \begin{align}    x & = \left(2 + \cos{(2t)} \right) \cos{(3t)} \\    y & = \left(2 + \cos{(2t)} \right) \sin{(3t)} \\    z & = \sin{(4t)}  \end{align}for t varying over the real numbers (see 2D visual realization at bottom right). 

Lake Zurich<====>59568<====>Lake Zurich    Lake Zürich (Swiss German/Alemannic: Zürisee; German: Zürichsee)  is a lake in Switzerland, extending southeast of the city of Zürich.  Depending on the context, Lake Zürich or Zürichsee can be used to describe the lake as a whole, or just that part of the lake downstream of the Seedamm at Rapperswil, whilst the part upstream of Rapperswil may be called the Obersee or Upper Lake. GeographyLake Zürich is formed by the Linth river, which rises in the glaciers of the Glarus Alps and was diverted by the Escher canal (completed in 1811) into Lake Walen from where its waters are carried to the east end of Lake Zürich by means of the Linth canal (completed in 1816). 

Putrajaya<====>59569<====>PutrajayaPutrajaya ( ), officially the Federal Territory of Putrajaya, is a planned city and the federal administrative centre of Malaysia.  The seat of government was shifted in 1999 from Kuala Lumpur to Putrajaya because of overcrowding and congestion in the former.  Kuala Lumpur remains Malaysia's national capital and is the seat of the King, the Parliament, and all the foreign embassies, and the country's commercial and financial centre.  Putrajaya was the idea of former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.  It became Malaysia's third Federal Territory, after Kuala Lumpur and Labuan, in 2001. 

Strait of Malacca<====>59570<====>Strait of Malacca The Strait of Malacca ( ,  ; Jawi: سلت ملاک) or Straits of Malacca is a narrow,   stretch of water between the Malay Peninsula (Peninsular Malaysia) and the Indonesian island of Sumatra.It is named after the Malacca Sultanate that ruled over the archipelago between 1400 and 1511. ExtentThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Strait of Malacca as follows: On the West.

Quidditch<====>59572<====>Quidditch   Quidditch   is a fictional sport, created by author J.  K.  Rowling in her fantasy fiction series Harry Potter.  The story of Harry Potter centres around wizards and witches studying their magical craft at Hogwarts: School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Born out of the lore of witches using flying broomsticks for transportation, Quidditch was developed by the author as the most popular sport in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter; a complex game played completely in the air by players on flying broomsticks. The objective of Quidditch, as with most sports, is to be the team that has gained the most points by the end of the match. 

Biproduct<====>59574<====>Biproduct In category theory and its applications to mathematics, a biproduct of a finite collection of objects, in a category with zero objects, is both a product and a coproduct. In a preadditive category the notions of product and coproduct coincide for finite collections of objects.  The biproduct is a generalization of finite direct sums of modules.DefinitionLet C be a category.Given a finite (possibly empty) collection of objects A 1 ,...,A n  in C, their biproduct is an object A 1  ⊕ ··· ⊕ A n  in C together with morphisms p k : A 1  ⊕ ··· ⊕ A n  → A k  in C (the projection morphisms)i k : A k  → A 1  ⊕ ··· ⊕ A n  (the embedding morphisms)and such that(A 1  ⊕ ··· ⊕ A n ,p k ) is a product for the A k (A 1  ⊕ ··· ⊕ A n ,i k ) is a coproduct for the A k .An empty, or nullary, product is always a terminal object in the category, and the empty coproduct is always an initial object in the category. Thus an empty, or nullary, biproduct is always a zero object.ExamplesIn the category of abelian groups, biproducts always exist and are given by the direct sum.  Note that the zero object is the trivial group.Similarly, biproducts exist in the category of vector spaces over a field. The biproduct is again the direct sum, and the zero object is the trivial vector space.More generally, biproducts exist in the category of modules over a ring.On the other hand, biproducts do not exist in the category of groups.  Here, the product is the direct product, but the coproduct is the free product.Also, biproducts do not exist in the category of sets. For, the product is given by the Cartesian product, whereas the coproduct is given by the disjoint union. Note also that this category does not have a zero object.Block matrix algebra relies upon biproducts in categories of matrices. PropertiesIf the biproduct A ⊕ B exists for all pairs of objects A and B in the category C, then all finite biproducts exist.If the product A 1  × A 2  and coproduct A 1  ∐ A 2  both exist for some pair of objects A i , then there is a unique morphism f: A 1  ∐ A 2  → A 1  × A 2  such thatp k  ∘ f ∘ i k  = 1 A k  p l  ∘ f ∘ i k  = 0 for k ≠ l.It follows that the biproduct A 1  ⊕ A 2  exists if and only if f is an isomorphism.If C is a preadditive category, then every finite product is a biproduct, and every finite coproduct is a biproduct. For example, if A 1  × A 2  exists, then there are unique morphisms i k : A k  → A 1  × A 2  such thatp k  ∘ i k  = 1 A k  p l  ∘ i k  = 0 for k ≠ l.To see that A 1  × A 2  is now also a coproduct, and hence a biproduct, suppose we have morphisms f k : A k  → X for some object X. Define f := f 1  ∘ p 1  + f 2  ∘ p 2 . Then f: A 1  × A 2  → X is a morphism and f ∘ i k  = f k .Note also that in this case we always havei 1  ∘ p 1  + i 2  ∘ p 2  = 1 A 1  × A 2  .An additive category is a preadditive category in which all finite biproduct exist. In particular, biproducts always exist in abelian categories.References

Seven Sages of Greece<====>59578<====>Seven Sages of GreeceThe Seven Sages (of Greece) or Seven Wise Men (Greek: οἱ ἑπτὰ σοφοί, hoi hepta sophoi) was the title given by classical Greek tradition to seven philosophers, statesmen, and law-givers of the early 6th century BC who were renowned for their wisdom. The Seven SagesTraditionally, the following sages are usually included in the list:Cleobulus of Lindos (fl.  6th century BC) governed as tyrant of Lindos, in the Greek island of Rhodes,   600 BC. Solon of Athens (  638 – 558 BC) was a famous legislator and reformer from Athens, framing the laws that shaped the Athenian democracy. 

Pledge of Allegiance (United States)<====>59581<====>Pledge of Allegiance (United States)  The Pledge of Allegiance of the United States is an expression of allegiance to the Flag of the United States and the republic of the United States of America, originally composed by Rear Admiral George Balch in 1887, later revised by Francis Bellamy in 1892 and formally adopted by Congress as the pledge in 1942.   The official name of The Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1945.  The last change in language came on Flag Day 1954 when the words "under God" were added.

Bilbo Baggins<====>59584<====>Bilbo BagginsBilbo Baggins is the title character and protagonist of J.  R.  R.  Tolkien's 1937 novel The Hobbit, as well as a supporting character in The Lord of the Rings.  In Tolkien's narrative conceit, in which all the writings of Middle-earth are translations from the fictitious volume of The Red Book of Westmarch, Bilbo is the author of The Hobbit and translator of various "works from the elvish" (as mentioned in the end of The Return of the King). AppearancesThe HobbitIn The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit in comfortable middle age at 50 years old, was hired as a "burglar," despite his objections, by the wizard Gandalf and 13 Dwarves led by their king Thorin Oakenshield on a quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain and its treasure from the dragon Smaug.

Anti-lock braking system<====>59587<====>Anti-lock braking system An anti-lock braking system or anti-skid braking system (ABS) is an automobile safety system that allows the wheels on a motor vehicle to maintain tractive contact with the road surface according to driver inputs while braking, preventing the wheels from locking up (ceasing rotation) and avoiding uncontrolled skidding.  It is an automated system that uses the principles of threshold braking and cadence braking which were practiced by skillful drivers with previous generation braking systems.  It does this at a much faster rate and with better control than many drivers could manage. ABS generally offers improved vehicle control and decreases stopping distances on dry and slippery surfaces; however, on loose gravel or snow-covered surfaces, ABS can significantly increase braking distance, although still improving vehicle steering control.

Heine–Borel theorem<====>59595<====>Heine–Borel theoremIn the topology of metric spaces the Heine–Borel theorem, named after Eduard Heine and Émile Borel, states:For a subset S of Euclidean space R n , the following two statements are equivalent:S is closed and boundedS is compact, that is, every open cover of S has a finite subcover.  This is the defining property of compact sets, called the Heine–Borel property. In the context of real analysis, the former property is sometimes used as the defining property of compactness.  However, the two definitions cease to be equivalent when we consider subsets of more general metric spaces and in this generality only the latter property is used to define compactness. 

Disc brake<====>59597<====>Disc brakeA disc brake is a type of brake that uses calipers to squeeze pairs of pads against a disc or "rotor"  to create friction.   This action retards the rotation of a shaft, such as a vehicle axle, either to reduce its rotational speed or to hold it stationary.  The energy of motion is converted into waste heat which must be dispersed.  Hydraulically actuated disc brakes are the most commonly used form of brake for motor vehicles, but the principles of a disc brake are applicable to almost any rotating shaft. DesignDevelopment of disc-type brakes began in England in the 1890s. 

Mission San Diego de Alcalá<====>59599<====>Mission San Diego de Alcalá  Mission Basilica San Diego de Alcalá was the first Franciscan mission in The Californias, a province of New Spain.  Located in present-day San Diego, California, it was founded on July 16, 1769 by Spanish friar Junípero Serra in an area long inhabited by the Kumeyaay people.  The mission and the surrounding area were named for the Catholic Didacus of Alcalá, a Spaniard more commonly known as San Diego.  The mission was the site of the first Christian burial in Alta California.  San Diego is also generally regarded as the site of the region's first public execution, in 1778.

Local loop<====>59602<====>Local loop In telephony, the local loop (also referred to as a local tail, subscriber line, or in the aggregate as the last mile) is the physical link or circuit that connects from the demarcation point of the customer premises to the edge of the common carrier or telecommunications service provider's network.  At the edge of the carrier access network in a traditional public telephone network, the local loop terminates in a circuit switch housed in an incumbent local exchange carrier or telephone exchange. InfrastructureTraditionally, the local loop was an electrical circuit in the form of a single pair of conductors from the telephone on the customer's premises to the local telephone exchange. 

Epiphenomenon<====>59604<====>EpiphenomenonAn epiphenomenon (plural: epiphenomena) is a secondary phenomenon that occurs alongside or in parallel to a primary phenomenon.  The word has two senses,  one that connotes known causation and one that connotes absence of causation or reservation of judgment about it.    ExamplesMetaphysics The problem of epiphenomena is often a counterexample to theories of causation and is identified with situations in which an event E is caused by (or, is said to be caused by) an event C, which also causes (or, is said to cause) an event F.  For example, take a simplified Lewisian counterfactual analysis of causation that the meaning of propositions about causal relationships between two events A and B can be explained in terms of counterfactual conditionals of the form “if A had not occurred then B would not have occurred”.

It is on the National Register of Historic Places and a U. S.  National Historic Landmark.   The mission was the headquarters of the Alta California missions headed by Saint Junípero Serra from 1770 until his death in 1784.  It was also the seat of the second presidente, Father Fermin Francisco de Lasuen. The mission buildings and lands were secularized by the Mexican government in 1833, and had fallen into disrepair by the mid-19th century. 

Subluxation<====>59606<====>Subluxation  In medicine, a subluxation is an incomplete or partial dislocation of a joint or organ.According to the WHO, it is a "significant structural displacement", and therefore, unlike the chiropractic "vertebral subluxation", is always visible on static imaging studies, such as X-rays.  WHO guidelines on basic training and safety in chiropractic, p.  4, including footnote.   The exact definition depends on the anatomical part being involved. JointsA subluxation of a joint is where a connecting bone is partially out of the joint.   In contrast to a luxation, which is a complete separation of the joints, a subluxation often returns to its normal position without additional help from a health professional.

She was launched on 17 April 1941 and commissioned on 5 June with Kapitänleutnant Heinrich Heinsohn (12 February 1910 – 6 May 1943) in command.  Heinsohn commanded her for her entire career in the Kriegsmarine.  In May 1941 he had arranged that the city of Landeck in Tyrol adopted the submarine within the then popular sponsorship programme (Patenschaftsprogramm), organising gifts and holidays for the crew, earning her the honorary name "U-573 Landeck". 

Atlantic Records<====>59610<====>Atlantic Records   Atlantic Recording Corporation (simply known as Atlantic Records) is an American major record label founded in October 1947 by Ahmet Ertegün and Herb Abramson.  Over its first 20 years of operation, Atlantic Records earned a reputation as one of the most important American recording labels, specializing in jazz, R&B and soul recordings by African-American musicians including Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett, Sam and Dave, Ruth Brown and Otis Redding, a position greatly enhanced by its distribution deal with Stax Records.  In 1967, Atlantic Records became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Bros. -Seven Arts, now the Warner Music Group, and expanded into rock and pop music with releases by bands such as Led Zeppelin and Yes. 

Ionization<====>59611<====>Ionization Ionization is the process by which an atom or a molecule acquires a negative or positive charge by gaining or losing electrons to form ions, often in conjunction with other chemical changes.   Ionization can result from the loss of an electron after collisions with subatomic particles, collisions with other atoms, molecules and ions, or through the interaction with light.  Heterolytic bond cleavage and heterolytic substitution reactions can result in the formation of ion pairs.  Ionization can occur through radioactive decay by the internal conversion process, in which an excited nucleus transfers its energy to one of the inner-shell electrons causing it to be ejected. 

Ionization energy<====>59613<====>Ionization energy The ionization energy (IE) is qualitatively defined as the amount of energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron, the valence electron, of an isolated gaseous atom to form a cation.  It is quantitatively expressed in symbols as  where   is any atom or molecule capable of being ionized,   is that atom or molecule with an electron removed, and   is the removed electron.  This is an endothermic process. Generally, the closer the electrons are to the nucleus of the atom, the higher the atom's ionization energy. The units for ionization energy are different in physics and chemistry. 

Electric potential<====>59615<====>Electric potentialAn electric  potential (also called the electric field potential, potential drop or the electrostatic potential) is the amount of work needed to move a unit  positive charge from a reference point to a specific point inside the field without producing any acceleration.  Typically, the reference point is Earth or a point at Infinity, although any point beyond the influence of the electric field charge can be used. According to classical electrostatics, electric potential is a scalar quantity denoted by  , equal to the electric potential energy of any charged particle at any location (measured in joules) divided by the charge of that particle (measured in coulombs). 

Fermentation theory<====>59616<====>Fermentation theoryThe fermentation theory was studied in depth and brought to light first by Louis Pasteur.  This theory states that it is the idea or concept of how fermentation is brought on by microbes and put to the concept of spontaneous generation to rest.   Even though this theory is now outdated and has been replaced by the germ theory of disease, for a long time it held true, and Louis was on the forefront of explaining why it seemed organisms appeared out of nothing instead of claiming it was just a spontaneous act of God.  Fermentation was a process that has been used for thousands of years, but no one could explain exactly what was happening and why. 

Glastonbury<====>59617<====>Glastonbury    Glastonbury   is a town and civil parish in Somerset, England, situated at a dry point on the low-lying Somerset Levels,   south of Bristol.  The town, which is in the Mendip district, had a population of 8,932 in the 2011 census.Glastonbury is less than   across the River Brue from Street, which is now larger than Glastonbury. Evidence from timber trackways such as the Sweet Track show that the town has been inhabited since Neolithic times.  Glastonbury Lake Village was an Iron Age village, close to the old course of the River Brue and Sharpham Park approximately   west of Glastonbury, that dates back to the Bronze Age. 

Bagworm moth<====>59618<====>Bagworm moth  The Psychidae (bagworm moths, also simply bagworms or bagmoths) are a family of the Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths).  The bagworm family is fairly small, with about 1350 species  described.  Bagworm species are found globally, with some, such as the snailcase bagworm (Apterona helicoidella), settling continents where they are not native in modern times. Another common name for the Psychidae is "case moths", but this is just as well used for the case-bearers (Coleophoridae).  The names refer to the habits of caterpillar of these two families, which build small protective cases in which they can hide.

Endomorphism ring<====>59623<====>Endomorphism ringIn abstract algebra, the endomorphism ring of an abelian group X, denoted by End(X), is the set of all endomorphisms of X (i. e. , the set of all homomorphisms of X into itself) endowed with an addition operation defined by pointwise addition of functions and a multiplication operation defined by function composition.  Using these operations, the set of endomorphisms of an abelian group forms a (unital) ring, with the zero map as additive identity and the identity map as   multiplicative identity.   The functions involved are restricted to what is defined as a homomorphism in the context, which depends upon the category of the object under consideration. 

Columbine High School massacre<====>59627<====>Columbine High School massacreThe Columbine High School massacre was a school shooting that occurred on April 20, 1999, at Columbine High School in Columbine,   an unincorporated area of Jefferson County, Colorado, U. S.  In addition to the shootings, the complex and highly planned attack involved a fire bomb to divert firefighters, propane tanks converted to bombs placed in the cafeteria, 99 explosive devices, and car bombs.  The perpetrators, senior students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, murdered 12 students and one teacher.  They injured 21 additional people, and three more were injured while attempting to escape the school. 

School shooting<====>59628<====>School shooting    A school shooting is a form of mass shooting attack on an educational institution, such as a school or university.   School shootings have sparked a political debate over gun violence, zero tolerance policies, and gun control. The United States has the highest number of school-related shootings.   ProfilingThe United States Secret Service published a study regarding 37 school shooting incidents in the United States from 1974 through June 2000, which warned against the belief that a certain "type" of student would be a perpetrator.   According to the study, any profile could apply to any student and might not apply to a potential perpetrator. 

Dunblane massacre<====>59629<====>Dunblane massacre    The Dunblane school massacre took place at Dunblane Primary School near Stirling, Stirlingshire, Scotland, on 13 March 1996, when gunman Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and one teacher before committing suicide.  It remains the deadliest mass shooting in British history.  Public debate about the killings centred on gun control laws, including public petitions calling for a ban on private ownership of handguns and an official inquiry, which produced the 1996 Cullen Reports.   In response to this debate, two new Firearms Acts were passed, which greatly restricted private ownership of firearms in Great Britain. 

Equal Rights Amendment<====>59635<====>Equal Rights Amendment The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) is a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution designed to guarantee equal rights for all citizens regardless of sex; it seeks to end the legal distinctions between men and women in terms of divorce, property, employment, and other matters.   The ERA was originally written by Alice Paul and Crystal Eastman.  The amendment was introduced in Congress for the first time in 1923 and has prompted conversations about the meaning of equality for women and men.  In its early history, middle-class women were largely supportive, while those speaking for the working class were often opposed, arguing that employed women needed special protections regarding working conditions and employment hours. 

Crocus<====>59637<====>Crocus   Crocus (English plural: crocuses or croci) is a genus of flowering plants in the iris family comprising 90 species of perennials growing from corms.  Many are cultivated for their flowers appearing in autumn, winter, or spring.  The spice saffron is obtained from the stigmas of Crocus sativus, an autumn-blooming species.  Crocuses are native to woodland, scrub, and meadows from sea level to alpine tundra in central and southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, on the islands of the Aegean, and across Central Asia to Xinjiang Province in western China.

Chivalry<====>59639<====>Chivalry   Chivalry, or the chivalric code, is an informal, varying code of conduct developed between 1170 and 1220, never decided on or summarized in a single document, associated with the medieval institution of knighthood; knights’ and gentlewomen's behaviors were governed by chivalrous social codes.   The ideals of chivalry were popularized in medieval literature, especially the Matter of Britain and Matter of France, the former based on Geoffrey of Monmouth's  Historia Regum Britanniae which introduced the legend of King Arthur, written in the 1130s.  The code of chivalry that developed in medieval Europe had its roots in earlier centuries. 

Italian unification<====>59642<====>Italian unificationItalian unification (   ), or the Risorgimento ( , meaning "the Resurgence" or "revival"), was the political and social movement that consolidated different states of the Italian peninsula into the single state of the Kingdom of Italy in the 19th century.  The process began in 1815 with the Congress of Vienna and was completed in 1871 when Rome became the capital of  the Kingdom of Italy.   The term, which also designates the cultural, political and social movement that promoted unification, recalls the romantic, nationalist and patriotic ideals of an Italian renaissance through the conquest of a unified political identity that, by sinking its ancient roots during the Roman period,  "suffered an abrupt halt [or loss] of its political unity in 476 AD after the collapse of the West Roman Empire. 

Digital signature<====>59644<====>Digital signatureA digital signature is a mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of digital messages or documents.  A valid digital signature gives a recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender (authentication), that the sender cannot deny having sent the message (non-repudiation), and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity).  Digital signatures are a standard element of most cryptographic protocol suites, and are commonly used for software distribution, financial transactions, contract management software, and in other cases where it is important to detect forgery or tampering. ExplanationDigital signatures are often used to implement electronic signatures, a broader term that refers to any electronic data that carries the intent of a signature,  but not all electronic signatures use digital signatures.

One person was also wounded by a bullet fragment. BackgroundWhile Steinhäuser's motive is unknown, media reports assumed it to be related to his expulsion from school without qualifications and his subsequent feeling of victimhood and hopelessness regarding his future job opportunities. 

Merkle–Hellman knapsack cryptosystem<====>59652<====>Merkle–Hellman knapsack cryptosystemThe Merkle–Hellman knapsack cryptosystem was one of the earliest public key cryptosystems invented by Ralph Merkle and Martin Hellman in 1978.   The ideas behind it are simpler than those involving RSA, and it has been broken.  DescriptionMerkle-Hellman is an asymmetric-key cryptosystem, meaning that two keys are required for communication: a public key and a private key.  Furthermore, unlike RSA, it is one-way: the public key is used only for encryption, and the private key is used only for decryption.  Thus it is unusable for authentication by cryptographic signing. The Merkle-Hellman system is based on the subset sum problem (a special case of the knapsack problem).

Rayleigh number<====>59656<====>Rayleigh number In fluid mechanics, the Rayleigh number (Ra) for a fluid is a dimensionless number associated with buoyancy-driven flow, also known as free convection or natural convection.  When the Rayleigh number is below a critical value for that fluid, heat transfer is primarily in the form of conduction; when it exceeds the critical value, heat transfer is primarily in the form of convection.  The Rayleigh number is defined as the product of the Grashof number, which describes the relationship between buoyancy and viscosity within a fluid, and the Prandtl number, which describes the relationship between momentum diffusivity and thermal diffusivity.

Gosling Emacs<====>59666<====>Gosling Emacs  Gosling Emacs (often shortened to "Gosmacs" or "gmacs") is a discontinued Emacs implementation written in 1981 by James Gosling in C.   Its extension language, Mocklisp, has a syntax that appears similar to Lisp, but Mocklisp does not have lists or any other structured datatypes.  Gosling initially allowed Gosling Emacs to be redistributed with no formal restrictions, but later sold it to UniPress.  Gosling Emacs was especially noteworthy because of the effective redisplay code,  which used a dynamic programming technique to solve the classical string-to-string correction problem.  The algorithm was quite sophisticated; that section of the source was headed by a skull-and-crossbones in ASCII art , warning any would-be improver that even if they thought they understood how the display code worked, they probably did not.

Regular hexagonA regular hexagon has Schläfli symbol {6}  and can also be constructed as a truncated equilateral triangle, t{3}, which alternates two types of edges.  A regular hexagon is defined as a hexagon that is both equilateral and equiangular.  It is bicentric, meaning that it is both cyclic (has a circumscribed circle) and tangential (has an inscribed circle).

Free group<====>59735<====>Free groupIn mathematics, the free group F S  over a given set S consists of all expressions (a. k. a.  words, or terms) that can be built from members of S, considering two expressions different unless their equality follows from the group axioms (e. g.  st = suu −1 t, but s ≠ t −1  for s,t,u∈S).  The members of S are called generators of F S . An arbitrary group G is called free if it is isomorphic to F S  for some subset S of G, that is, if there is a subset S of G such that every element of G can be written in one and only one way as a product of finitely many elements of S and their inverses (disregarding trivial variations such as st = suu −1 t).

Genetic engineering was not "invented" by Heinlein, stories of "Ubermensch" had been around for decades, but it was brought to the heart of a society for the first time by Heinlein. 

Retroreflector<====>59853<====>Retroreflector A retroreflector (sometimes called a retroflector or cataphote) is a device or surface that reflects light back to its source with a minimum of scattering.  In a retroreflector an electromagnetic wavefront is reflected back along a vector that is parallel to but opposite in direction from the wave's source.  The angle of incidence at which the device or surface reflects light in this way is greater than zero, unlike a planar mirror, which does this only if the mirror is exactly perpendicular to the wave front, having a zero angle of incidence. TypesThere are several ways to obtain retroreflection: Corner reflector A set of three mutually perpendicular reflective surfaces, placed to form the corner of a cube, work as a retroreflector. 

Rhea (mythology)<====>59855<====>Rhea (mythology)  Rhea ( ;    ) is a character in Greek mythology, the Titaness daughter of the earth goddess Gaia and the sky god Uranus, and sister and wife to Cronus.  In early traditions, she is known as "the mother of gods" and therefore is strongly associated with Gaia and Cybele, who have similar functions.  The classical Greeks saw her as the mother of the Olympian gods and goddesses, but not as an Olympian goddess in her own right.  The Romans identified her with Magna Mater (their form of Cybele), and the Goddess Ops. 

Rhea (moon)<====>59856<====>Rhea (moon)  Rhea (   ;  ) is the second-largest moon of Saturn and the ninth-largest moon in the Solar System.  It is the second smallest body in the Solar System, after the asteroid and dwarf planet Ceres, for which precise measurements have confirmed a shape consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium.It was discovered in 1672 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini. DiscoveryRhea was discovered by Giovanni Domenico Cassini on 23 December 1672.    It was the third moon discovered around Saturn and the second by him.

There were formerly two, but now three recognized extant species: the greater or American rhea (Rhea americana), the lesser or Darwin's rhea (Rhea pennata) and the puna rhea (Rhea tarapacensis).  The greater and puna rheas are currently rated as near-threatened in their native ranges, while Darwin's rhea is of least concern; a feral population of the greater rhea in Germany appears to be growing.

Experiment<====>59861<====>Experiment  An experiment is a procedure carried out to support, refute, or validate a hypothesis.  Experiments provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated.  Experiments vary greatly in goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results.  There also exists natural experimental studies. A child may carry out basic experiments to understand gravity, while teams of scientists may take years of systematic investigation to advance their understanding of a phenomenon.  Experiments and other types of hands-on activities are very important to student learning in the science classroom. 

Escape Velocity (video game)<====>59862<====>Escape Velocity (video game)  Escape Velocity is a single-player role-playing space trading and combat video game series first introduced in 1996 by Ambrosia Software for the Apple Macintosh.  Two other similar games based on the original, EV Override and EV Nova, followed in 1998 and 2002 respectively, the latter of which is also available on Microsoft Windows.  In addition there is a trading card game available based on the storyline of the EV Nova universe. The series was created as a joint effort between several people and groups.  Matt Burch programmed all three games in their entirety except for the registration system and various libraries. 

Correspondence principle<====>59863<====>Correspondence principle In physics, the correspondence principle states that the behavior of systems described by the theory of quantum mechanics (or by the old quantum theory) reproduces classical physics in the limit of large quantum numbers.  In other words, it says that for large orbits and for large energies, quantum calculations must agree with classical calculations.    The principle was formulated by Niels Bohr in 1920,  though he had previously made use of it as early as 1913 in developing his model of the atom.  The term codifies the idea that a new theory should reproduce under some conditions the results of older well-established theories in those domains where the old theories work. 

Secure cryptoprocessor<====>59865<====>Secure cryptoprocessor A secure cryptoprocessor is a dedicated computer on a chip or microprocessor for carrying out cryptographic operations, embedded in a packaging with multiple physical security measures, which give it a degree of tamper resistance.   Unlike cryptographic processors that output decrypted data onto a bus in a secure environment, a secure cryptoprocessor does not output decrypted data or decrypted program instructions in an environment where security cannot always be maintained. The purpose of a secure cryptoprocessor is to act as the keystone of a security subsystem, eliminating the need to protect the rest of the subsystem with physical security measures. 

Charleston (dance)<====>59866<====>Charleston (dance) The Charleston is a dance named for the harbor city of Charleston, South Carolina.  The rhythm was popularized in mainstream dance music in the United States by a 1923 tune called "The Charleston" by composer/pianist James P.  Johnson which originated in the Broadway show Runnin' Wild Broadway Production: Runnin' Wild  and became one of the most popular hits of the decade.  Runnin' Wild ran from 29 October 1923, through 28 June 1924.   The peak year for the Charleston as a dance by the public was mid-1926 to 1927.  OriginsWhile the dance probably came from the "star" or challenge dances that were all part of the African-American dance called Juba, the particular sequence of steps which appeared in Runnin' Wild were probably newly devised for popular appeal. 

Interpreter (computing)<====>59868<====>Interpreter (computing) In computer science, an interpreter is a computer program that directly executes, i. e.  performs, instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.  An interpreter generally uses one of the following strategies for program execution:parse the source code and perform its behavior directly;translate source code into some efficient intermediate representation and immediately execute this;explicitly execute stored precompiled code  made by a compiler which is part of the interpreter system. Early versions of Lisp programming language and Dartmouth BASIC would be examples of the first type. 

Schrödinger equation<====>59874<====>Schrödinger equation   In quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation is a mathematical equation that describes the changes over time of a physical system in which quantum effects, such as wave–particle duality, are significant.  The equation is a mathematical formulation for studying quantum mechanical systems.  It is considered a central result in the study of quantum systems and its derivation was a significant landmark in developing the theory of quantum mechanics.  It was named after Erwin Schrödinger, who derived the equation in 1925 and published it in 1926, forming the basis for his work that resulted in his being awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933.

The constant is also a combination of the constants from Boyle's law, Charles's law, Avogadro's law, and Gay-Lussac's law.  It is a physical constant that is featured in many fundamental equations in the physical  sciences, such as the ideal gas law and the Nernst equation.Physically, the gas constant is the constant of proportionality that happens to relate the energy scale in physics to the temperature scale, when a mole of particles at the stated temperature is being considered. Thus, the value of the gas constant ultimately derives from historical decisions and accidents in the setting of the energy and temperature scales, plus similar historical setting of the value of the molar scale used for the counting of particles. The last factor is not a consideration in the value of the Boltzmann constant, which does a similar job of equating linear energy and temperature scales.The gas constant value is   The two digits in parentheses are the uncertainty (standard deviation) in the last two digits of the value. The relative uncertainty is  .Some have suggested that it might be appropriate to name the symbol R the Regnault constant in honour of the French chemist Henri Victor Regnault, whose accurate experimental data were used to calculate the early value of the constant; however, the exact reason for the original representation of the constant by the letter R is elusive. The gas constant occurs in the ideal gas law, as follows: pV = nRT = m R_{\rm specific} T \,\! where p is the absolute pressure (SI unit pascals), V is the volume of gas (SI unit cubic metres), n is the amount of gas (SI unit moles), m is the mass (SI unit kilograms) contained in V,  and T is the thermodynamic temperature (SI unit kelvins). The gas constant is expressed in the same physical units as molar entropy and molar heat capacity.Dimensions of RFrom the general equation pV = nRT we get: R = \frac{pV}{nT} where p is pressure, V is volume, n is number of moles of a given substance, and T is temperature.As pressure is defined as force per unit area, the gas equation can also be written as: R = \frac{ \dfrac{\mathrm{force}}{\mathrm{area}} \times \mathrm{volume} }{ \mathrm{amount} \times \mathrm{temperature} } Area and volume are (length) 2  and (length) 3  respectively. Therefore: R = \frac{ \dfrac{\mathrm{force} }{ (\mathrm{length})^2} \times (\mathrm{length})^3 }{ \mathrm{amount} \times \mathrm{temperature} }   = \frac{ \mathrm{force} \times \mathrm{length} }{ \mathrm{amount} \times \mathrm{temperature} } Since force × length = work: R = \frac{ \mathrm{work} }{ \mathrm{amount} \times \mathrm{temperature} } The physical significance of R is work per degree per mole. It may be expressed in any set of units representing work or energy (such as joules), other units representing degrees of temperature (such as degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit), and any system of units designating a mole or a similar pure number that allows an equation of macroscopic mass and fundamental particle numbers in a system, such as an ideal gas (see Avogadro's number).Instead of a mole the constant can be expressed by considering the normal cubic meter.Otherwise, we can also say that: \mathrm{force} = \frac{ \mathrm{mass} \times \mathrm{length} }{ (\mathrm{time})^2 } Therefore, we can write "R" as: R = \frac{ \mathrm{mass} \times \mathrm{length}^2 }{ \mathrm{amount} \times \mathrm{temperature} \times (\mathrm{time})^2 } And so, in SI base units:R =  .Relationship with the Boltzmann constantThe Boltzmann constant k B  (often abbreviated k) may be used in place of the gas constant by working in pure particle count, N, rather than amount of substance, n, since R = N_{\rm A} k_{\rm B},\, where N A  is the Avogadro constant.For example, the ideal gas law in terms of Boltzmann's constant is pV = k_{\rm B} N T.\,\! where N is the number of particles (molecules in this case), or to generalize to an inhomogeneous system the local form holds: p = k_{\rm B} n T.\,\! where n is the number density. \textrm{Boltzmann's}\ \textrm{constant} = \frac{ \textrm{Planck}\ \textrm{mass} \times (\textrm{Planck}\ \textrm{length})^2 }{ \textrm{Planck}\ \textrm{temperature} \times (\textrm{Planck}\ \textrm{time})^2 } MeasurementAs of 2006, the most precise measurement of R is obtained by measuring the speed of sound c a (p, T) in argon at the temperature T of the triple point of water  at different pressures p, and extrapolating to the zero-pressure limit c a (0, T). The value of R is then obtained from the relation c_\mathrm{a}(0, T) = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma_0 R T}{A_\mathrm{r}(\mathrm{Ar}) M_\mathrm{u}}}, where:γ 0  is the heat capacity ratio (  for monatomic gases such as argon);T is the temperature, T TPW  = 273.16 K by definition of the kelvin;A r (Ar) is the relative atomic mass of argon and M u  =  .Specific gas constantR specific  for dry air Units 287.058 J kg −1  K −1  53.3533 ft lbf lb −1  °R −1  1,716.49 ft lbf slug  −1  °R −1    The specific gas constant of a gas or a mixture of gases (R specific ) is given by the molar gas constant divided by the molar mass (M) of the gas or mixture.  R_{\rm specific} = \frac{R}{M}  Just as the ideal gas constant can be related to the Boltzmann constant, so can the specific gas constant by dividing the Boltzmann constant by the molecular mass of the gas.  R_{\rm specific} = \frac{k_{\rm B}}{m}  Another important relationship comes from thermodynamics. Mayer's relation relates the specific gas constant to the specific heats for a calorically perfect gas and a thermally perfect gas.  R_{\rm specific} = c_{\rm p} - c_{\rm v}\  where c p  is the specific heat for a constant pressure and c v  is the specific heat for a constant volume. It is common, especially in engineering applications, to represent the specific gas constant by the symbol R. In such cases, the universal gas constant is usually given a different symbol such as   to distinguish it. In any case, the context and/or units of the gas constant should make it clear as to whether the universal or specific gas constant is being referred to. U.S. Standard AtmosphereThe U.S. Standard Atmosphere, 1976 (USSA1976) defines the gas constant R* as:    Part 1, p. 3, (Linked file is 17 Meg) R* =  .Note the use of kilomole units resulting in the factor of 1,000 in the constant. The USSA1976 acknowledges that this value is not consistent with the cited values for the Avogadro constant and the Boltzmann constant.  This disparity is not a significant departure from accuracy, and USSA1976 uses this value of R* for all the calculations of the standard atmosphere. When using the ISO value of R, the calculated pressure increases by only 0.62 pascal at 11 kilometers (the equivalent of a difference of only 17.4 centimeters or 6.8 inches) and an increase of 0.292 Pa at 20 km (the equivalent of a difference of only 0.338 m or 13.2 in).References  External linksIdeal gas calculator – Ideal gas calculator provides the correct information for the moles of gas involved.Individual Gas Constants and the Universal Gas Constant — Engineering Toolbox DEFAULTSORT

Erysimum<====>59916<====>Erysimum   Erysimum (wallflower) is a genus of flowering plants that includes about 180 species of popular garden plants and many wild forms in the botanical family Brassicaceae.  The genus Cheiranthus is sometimes included here in whole or in part.  Erysimum has since the early 21st century been ascribed to a monogeneric   tribe, Erysimeae, characterized by sessile,   and/or   trichomes, yellow to orange flowers and multiseeded siliques. MorphologyWallflowers are annuals, herbaceous perennials or sub-shrubs.  The perennial species are short-lived and in cultivation treated as biennials.  Most species have stems erect, somewhat winged,   with an indumentum of bifid hairs, usually 25 ± 53 cm × 2–3 mm in size, and t-shaped trichomes.

Normal height is about 30 cm, prostrate habit.The plant flourishes in full sun and well-drained soil and is fairly hardy. It flowers continually from late spring to late summer. Flowers start off yellow then fade through tangerine to purple, often with a succession of colours on the same flower head. Some claim that it can be seen changing colors from day to dayReferences  

Pheasant<====>59919<====>Pheasant  Pheasants ( ) are birds of several genera within the subfamily Phasianinae, of the family Phasianidae in the order Galliformes.  The family's native range is restricted to Asia. Pheasants are characterised by strong sexual dimorphism, males being highly decorated with bright colors and adornments such as wattles.  Males are usually larger than females and have longer tails.  Males play no part in rearing the young.  Pheasants typically eat seeds and some insects. The best-known is the common pheasant, which is widespread throughout the world, in introduced feral populations and in farm operations.  Various other pheasant species are popular in aviaries, such as the golden pheasant (Chrysolophus pictus).

Falconidae<====>59940<====>Falconidae  The falcons and caracaras are around 60 species of diurnal birds of prey that make up the family Falconidae.  The family is divided into two subfamilies, Polyborinae, which includes the caracaras and forest falcons, and Falconinae, the falcons, kestrels and falconets (Microhierax and Spiziapteryx).  They differ from the eagles of Accipitridae, in that falcons kill with their beaks instead of their taloned feet.  They have a "tooth" on the side of their beak for this purpose. DescriptionFalcons and caracaras are small to medium-sized birds of prey, ranging in size from the black-thighed falconet, which can weigh as little as  , to the gyrfalcon, which can weigh as much as  . 

Nyaya<====>59941<====>Nyaya(Sanskrit: न्याय, ny-āyá), literally means "rules", "method" or "judgment".   Nyaya: Indian Philosophy Encyclopædia Britannica (2014)  It is also the name of one of the six orthodox (astika) schools of Hinduism.   This school's most significant contributions to Indian philosophy was systematic development of the theory of logic, methodology, and its treatises on epistemology.   Nyaya school's epistemology accepts four out of six Pramanas as reliable means of gaining knowledge – Pratyakṣa (perception), Anumāṇa (inference), Upamāṇa (comparison and analogy) and Śabda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).

Program counter<====>59944<====>Program counterThe program counter (PC), commonly called the instruction pointer (IP) in Intel x86 and Itanium microprocessors, and sometimes called the instruction address register (IAR),  the instruction counter,  or just part of the instruction sequencer, Harry Katzan (1971), Computer Organization and the System/370, Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, New York, USA, LCCCN 72-153191 is a processor register that indicates where a computer is in its program sequence. In most processors, the PC is incremented after fetching an instruction, and holds the memory address of ("points to") the next instruction that would be executed.   (In a processor where the incrementation precedes the fetch, the PC points to the current instruction being executed. 

History of logic<====>59945<====>History of logic The history of logic deals with the study of the development of the science of valid inference (logic).   Formal logics developed in ancient times in India, China, and Greece.  Greek methods, particularly Aristotelian logic (or term logic) as found in the Organon, found wide application and acceptance in Western science and mathematics for millennia.  Boehner p.  xiv  The Stoics, especially Chrysippus, began the development of predicate logic. Christian and Islamic philosophers such as Boethius (died 524) and William of Ockham (died 1347) further developed Aristotle's logic in the Middle Ages, reaching a high point in the mid-fourteenth century. 

Anglo-Catholicism<====>59949<====>Anglo-Catholicism   The terms Anglo-Catholicism, Anglican Catholicism, and Catholic Anglicanism refer to people, beliefs and practices within Anglicanism that emphasise the Catholic heritage and identity of the various Anglican churches.  The term Anglo-Catholic was coined in the early 19th century,  although movements emphasising the Catholic nature of Anglicanism had already existed.    Particularly influential in the history of Anglo-Catholicism were the Caroline Divines of the seventeenth century and later the leaders of the Oxford Movement, which began at the University of Oxford in 1833 and ushered in a period of Anglican history known as the "Catholic Revival". 

Thirty-nine Articles<====>59952<====>Thirty-nine Articles    The Thirty-nine Articles of Religion (commonly abbreviated as the Thirty-nine Articles or the XXXIX Articles) are the historically defining statements of doctrines and practices of the Church of England with respect to the controversies of the English Reformation.   The Thirty-nine Articles form part of the Book of Common Prayer used by both the Church of England and the Episcopal Church.  Several versions are available online. When Henry VIII broke with the Roman Catholic Church and was excommunicated, he formed a new Church of England, which would be headed by the monarch (himself) rather than the pope. 

Van Allen radiation belt<====>59953<====>Van Allen radiation beltA Van Allen radiation belt is a zone of energetic charged particles, most of which originate from the solar wind that is captured by and held around a planet by that planet's magnetic field.  The Earth has two such belts and sometimes others may be temporarily created.  The discovery of the belts is credited to James Van Allen, and as a result the Earth's belts are known as the Van Allen belts.  Earth's two main belts extend from an altitude of about 500 to 58,000 kilometers  above the surface in which region radiation levels vary. 

Trojan Horse<====>59955<====>Trojan Horse The Trojan Horse is a tale from the Trojan War about the subterfuge that the Greeks used to enter the independent city of Troy and win the war.  In the canonical version, after a fruitless 10-year siege, the Greeks constructed a huge wooden horse, and hid a select force of men inside.  The Greeks pretended to sail away, and the Trojans pulled the horse into their city as a victory trophy.  That night the Greek force crept out of the horse and opened the gates for the rest of the Greek army, which had sailed back under cover of night. 

Smart card<====>59957<====>Smart card A smart card, chip card, or integrated circuit card (ICC), is any pocket-sized card that has embedded integrated circuits.   Smart cards are made of plastic, generally polyvinyl chloride, but sometimes polyethylene-terephthalate-based polyesters, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene or polycarbonate. Since April 2009, a Japanese company has manufactured reusable financial smart cards made from paper.  Smart cards can be contact, contactless, or both.  They can provide personal identification, authentication, data storage, and application processing.   Smart cards may provide strong security authentication for single sign-on (SSO) within organizations. HistoryInventionIn 1968 and 1969 Helmut Gröttrup and Jürgen Dethloff jointly filed patents for the automated chip card. 

Power series<====>59958<====>Power series In mathematics, a power series (in one variable) is an infinite series of the form \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n \left( x-c \right)^n = a_0 + a_1 (x-c)^1+ a_2 (x-c)^2 + \cdots where a n  represents the coefficient of the nth term and c is a constant.  a n  is independent of x and may be expressed as a function of n (e. g.   a_n=\frac{1}{n!} ). This series usually arises as the Taylor series of some known function. In many situations c (the center of the series) is equal to zero, for instance when considering a Maclaurin series.

Discrete cosine transform<====>59962<====>Discrete cosine transformA discrete cosine transform (DCT) expresses a finite sequence of data points in terms of a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies.   DCTs are important to numerous applications in science and engineering, from lossy compression of audio (e. g.  MP3) and images (e. g.  JPEG) (where small high-frequency components can be discarded), to spectral methods for the numerical solution of partial differential equations.   The use of cosine rather than sine functions is critical for compression, since it turns out (as described below) that fewer cosine functions are needed to approximate a typical signal, whereas for differential equations the cosines express a particular choice of boundary conditions.

Roman surface<====>59979<====>Roman surfaceThe Roman surface or Steiner surface is a self-intersecting mapping  of the real projective plane into three-dimensional space, with an unusually high degree of symmetry.  This mapping is not an immersion of the projective plane; however, the figure resulting from removing six singular points is one.  Its name arises because it was discovered by Jakob Steiner when he was in Rome in 1844.    The simplest construction is as the image of a sphere centered at the origin under the map f(x,y,z) = (yz,xz,xy).  This gives an implicit formula of   x^2 y^2 + y^2 z^2 + z^2 x^2 - r^2 x y z = 0.

Aconitum<====>59988<====>Aconitum  Aconitum ( ),  commonly known as aconite, monkshood, wolf's bane, leopard's bane, mousebane, women's bane, devil's helmet, queen of poisons, or blue rocket, is a genus of over 250 species of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae.  These herbaceous perennial plants are chiefly native to the mountainous parts of the Northern Hemisphere,    growing in the moisture-retentive but well-draining soils of mountain meadows.  Most species are extremely poisonous  and must be dealt with carefully. EtymologyThe name aconitum comes from the Greek  , which may derive from the Greek akon for dart or javelin, the tips of which were poisoned with the substance, or from akonae, because of the rocky ground on which the plant was thought to grow. 

Aconitine<====>59990<====>Aconitine Aconitine is a toxin produced by the Aconitum plant, also known as devil’s helmet or monkshood.  Monkshood is notorious for its toxic properties.  In China, aconitine is also used in small doses as an analgesic and blood coagulant.  UsesAconitine was previously used as an antipyretic and analgesic and still has some limited application in herbal medicine although the narrow therapeutic index makes calculating appropriate dosage difficult.    Structure and reactivityBiologically active isolates from Aconitum and Delphinium plants are classified as norditerpenoid alkaloids, which are further subdivided based on the presence or absence of the C18 carbonaconitum.

It is the opening track and lead single from the band's second album, Nevermind (1991), released on DGC Records. The unexpected success of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" in late 1991 propelled Nevermind to the top of the charts at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point where alternative rock entered the mainstream.   "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was Nirvana's biggest hit, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and placing high on music industry charts all around the world in 1991 and 1992. 

Battle of Dunbar (1296)<====>59995<====>Battle of Dunbar (1296) The Battle of Dunbar was the only significant field action in the campaign of 1296.  King Edward I of England had invaded Scotland in 1296 to punish King John Balliol for his refusal to support English military action in France.  The battlefield is currently under research to be inventoried and protected by Historic Scotland under the Scottish Historical Environment Policy of 2009.  BackgroundAfter the sack of Berwick-upon-Tweed, Edward rushed to complete the conquest of Scotland, remained in the town for a month, supervising the strengthening of its defences. 

Lola Montez<====>59999<====>Lola MontezMarie Dolores Eliza Rosanna Gilbert, Countess of Landsfeld  (17 February 1821 – 17 January 1861), better known by the stage name Lola Montez, was an Irish dancer and actress who became famous as a "Spanish dancer", courtesan, and mistress of King Ludwig I of Bavaria, who made her Countess of Landsfeld.  She used her influence to institute liberal reforms.  At the start of the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states, she was forced to flee.  She proceeded to the United States via Switzerland, France and London, returning to her work as an entertainer and lecturer. 

Bassist<====>60001<====>Bassist    A bassist, or bass player, is a musician who plays a bass instrument such as a double bass, bass guitar, keyboard bass or a low brass instrument such as a tuba or sousaphone.  Different musical genres tend to be associated with one or more of these instruments.  Since the 1960s, the electric bass has been the standard bass instrument for funk,  R&B, soul music, rock and roll, reggae, jazz fusion, heavy metal, country and pop music.  The double bass is the standard bass instrument for classical music, bluegrass, rockabilly, and most genres of jazz. 

Aotearoa<====>60002<====>Aotearoa  Aotearoa ( ) is the Māori name for New Zealand.  It is often pronounced   by English speakers, and its use is becoming widespread in the bilingual names of national organisations and institutions.  The term was originally used by Māori in reference to only the North Island.  Since the 1990s, it has been customary to sing New Zealand's national anthem, "God Defend New Zealand", in both Māori and English,  exposing the name to a wider audience. EtymologyThe original derivation of Aotearoa is not known.  The word can be broken up as: ao = cloud, dawn, daytime or world, tea = white, clear or bright and roa = long. 

Taniwha<====>60003<====>Taniwha In Māori mythology, taniwha ( )  are beings that live in deep pools in rivers, dark caves, or in the sea, especially in places with dangerous currents or deceptive breakers (giant waves).  They may be considered highly respected kaitiaki (protective guardians) of people and places, or in some traditions as dangerous, predatory beings, which for example would kidnap women to have as wives. Etymology and Pacific analoguesLinguists have reconstructed the word taniwha to Proto-Oceanic *tanifa, with the meaning "shark species".  In Tongan and Niuean, tenifa refers to a large dangerous shark, as does the Samoan tanifa; the Tokelauan tanifa is a sea-monster that eats people. 

Ernest Shackleton<====>60004<====>Ernest Shackleton Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton    ( ;  15 February 1874 – 5 January 1922) was a polar explorer who led three British expeditions to the Antarctic, and one of the principal figures of the period known as the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration.    Born in Kilkea, Athy, County Kildare, Ireland, Shackleton and his Anglo-Irish family  moved to Sydenham in suburban south London when he was ten.  His first experience of the polar regions was as third officer on Captain Robert Falcon Scott's Discovery Expedition 1901–1904, from which he was sent home early on health grounds, after he and his companions Scott and Edward Adrian Wilson set a new southern record by marching to latitude 82°S. 

Douglas Mawson<====>60005<====>Douglas Mawson    Sir Douglas Mawson OBE FRS    FAA (5 May 1882 – 14 October 1958) was an Australian geologist, Antarctic explorer, and academic.  Along with Roald Amundsen, Robert Falcon Scott, and Ernest Shackleton, he was a key expedition leader during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration.  The Mawson Station in the Australian Antarctic Territory is named in his honour. Early lifeMawson was born on 5 May 1882 to Robert Ellis Mawson and Margaret Ann Moore.   He was born in Shipley, West Yorkshire, but was less than two years old when his family immigrated to Australia and settled at Rooty Hill, now in the western suburbs of Sydney. 

Police perjury<====>60006<====>Police perjuryPolice perjury (or testilying in United States police slang) is the act of a police officer giving false testimony.  It is typically used in a criminal trial to "make the case" against a defendant believed by the police to be guilty when irregularities during the suspect's arrest or search threaten to result in acquittal. It also can be extended further to encompass substantive misstatements of fact for the purpose of convicting those whom the police believe to be guilty, or even to include statements to frame an innocent citizen. More generically, it has been said to be "[l]ying under oath, especially by a police officer, to help get a conviction. 

Zangger Committee<====>60007<====>Zangger CommitteeThe Zangger Committee, also known as the Nuclear Exporters Committee, sprang from Article III. 2 of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) which entered into force on March 5, 1970.  Under the terms of Article III. 2 International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards must be applied to nuclear exports. Each State Party to the Treaty undertakes not to provide: (a) source or special fissionable material, or (b) equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing, use or production of special fissionable material, to any non-nuclear-weapon State for peaceful purposes, unless the source or special fissionable material shall be subject to the safeguards required by this Article. 

Thaler<====>60010<====>Thaler The thaler was a silver coin used throughout Europe for almost four hundred years.  Its name lives on in the many currencies called dollar and, until recently, also in the Slovenian tolar.  To begin with, the name "thaler" was used as an abbreviation of "Joachimsthaler", a coin type from the town of Joachimsthal in the Kingdom of Bohemia (now the Czech Republic), where there were silver mines and the first such coins were minted in 1518.  This original Bohemian thaler carried a lion, from the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Bohemia, on its reverse side. 

Formal power series<====>60012<====>Formal power series In mathematics, a formal power series is a generalization of a polynomial, where the number of terms is allowed to be infinite; this implies giving up the possibility of replacing the variable in the polynomial with an arbitrary number.   Thus a formal power series differs from a polynomial in that it may have infinitely many terms, and differs from a power series, whose variables can take on numerical values.   One way to view a formal power series is as an infinite ordered sequence of numbers.   In this case, the powers of the variable are used only to indicate the order of the coefficients, so that the coefficient of  x^5  is the fifth term in the sequence.

European exploration of Australia<====>60018<====>European exploration of Australia The European exploration of Australia was the exploration of Australia by Europeans, or white explorers from the European continent, encompassing several waves of seafarers and land explorers.  Dutch navigators were the first Europeans known to have explored and mapped the Australian coastline.  The first documented encounter was that of Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon, in 1606.  Dutch seafarers also visited the west and north coasts of the continent, as did French explorers.  The most famous expedition was that of Royal Navy Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook 164 years after Janszoon's sighting, who after an assignment to make observations of the 1769 Venus Transit, followed Admiralty instructions to explore the south Pacific for the reported Terra Australis and on 19 April 1770 sighted the south-eastern coast of Australia and became the first recorded European to explore the eastern coastline.

They are arranged with increasing atomic numbers (proton numbers) from left to right and increasing neutron numbers from top to bottom. For convenience, two different views of the data are available here: “Segmented tables,” and a single “Unitized table (all elements). ” Choose whichever one you need from the table of contents, below.  The unitized table allows easy visualizion of proton/neutron-count trends but requires simultaneous horizontal and vertical scrolling.  The segmented tables permit easier examination of a particular chemical element with much less scrolling. 

Fractal compression<====>60022<====>Fractal compressionFractal compression is a lossy compression method for digital images, based on fractals.  The method is best suited for textures and natural images, relying on the fact that parts of an image often resemble other parts of the same image.   Fractal algorithms convert these parts into mathematical data called "fractal codes" which are used to recreate the encoded image. Iterated function systems Fractal image representation may be described mathematically as an iterated function system (IFS).  For binary imagesWe begin with the representation of a binary image, where the image may be thought of as a subset of  \mathbb{R}^2 . 

Airbag<====>60023<====>Airbag  An airbag is a type of vehicle safety device and is an occupant restraint system.  The airbag module is designed to inflate extremely rapidly then quickly deflate during a collision or impact with a surface or a rapid sudden deceleration. It consists of the airbag cushion, a flexible fabric bag, inflation module and impact sensor.  The purpose of the airbag is to provide the occupants a soft cushioning and restraint during a crash event to prevent or reduce any impact or impact-caused injuries between the flailing occupant and the interior of the vehicle. The airbag provides an energy absorbing surface between the vehicle's occupant and a steering wheel, instrumental panel, A-B-C- structural body frame pillars, headliner and windshield/windscreen. 

Sam Houston<====>60024<====>Sam Houston   Sam Houston (March 2, 1793 July 26, 1863) was an American soldier and politician.  His victory at the Battle of San Jacinto secured the independence of Texas from Mexico in one of the shortest decisive battles in modern history.   He was also the only governor within a future Confederate state to oppose secession (which led to the outbreak of the American Civil War) and to refuse an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy, a decision that led to his removal from office by the Texas secession convention.  "But when he refused to take the oath of loyalty to the newly formed Confederate States of America, the Texas convention removed him from office on March 16 and replaced him with Lieutenant Governor Edward Clark two days later. 

Jack Buck<====>60025<====>Jack Buck John Francis "Jack" Buck (August 21, 1924 – June 18, 2002) was an American sportscaster, best known for his work announcing Major League Baseball games of the St.  Louis Cardinals.  His play-by-play work earned him recognition from numerous Halls of Fame, such as the National Baseball Hall of Fame, the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and the National Radio Hall of Fame.  He has also been inducted as a member of the St.  Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum. Buck was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts but moved to the Cleveland, Ohio area with his family in 1939. 

Guadalcanal Campaign<====>60026<====>Guadalcanal Campaign  The Guadalcanal Campaign, also known as the Battle of Guadalcanal and codenamed Operation Watchtower, was a military campaign fought between 7 August 1942 and 9 February 1943 on and around the island of Guadalcanal in the Pacific theater of World War II.  It was the first major offensive by Allied forces against the Empire of Japan. On 7 August 1942, Allied forces, predominantly United States Marines, landed on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida in the southern Solomon Islands, with the objective of denying their use by the Japanese to threaten Allied supply and communication routes between the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. 

Battle of Iwo Jima<====>60027<====>Battle of Iwo Jima    The Battle of Iwo Jima (19 February – 26 March 1945) was a major battle in which the United States Marine Corps landed on and eventually captured the island of Iwo Jima from the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II.  The American invasion, designated Operation Detachment, had the goal of capturing the entire island, including the three Japanese-controlled airfields (including the South Field and the Central Field), to provide a staging area for attacks on the Japanese main islands.   This five-week battle comprised some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting of the Pacific War of World War II.

The population, as of December 2014,  is 113,939.  Located in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, it was the capital of Włocławek Voivodeship until 1999. HistoryWłocławek's history dates back to the late Bronze Age – early Iron Age (1300 BCE – 500 BCE).  Archeological excavations conducted on the current city site uncovered the remains of a settlement belonging to the Lausitz culture, as well as evidence of a settlement of early Pomeranian culture which had been established. 

Trinity (nuclear test)<====>60033<====>Trinity (nuclear test)    Trinity was the code name of the first detonation of a nuclear weapon.   It was conducted by the United States Army at 5:29 a. m.  on July 16, 1945, as part of the Manhattan Project.  The test was conducted in the Jornada del Muerto desert about 35 miles (56 km) southeast of Socorro, New Mexico, on what was then the USAAF Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range, now part of White Sands Missile Range.  The only structures originally in the vicinity were the McDonald Ranch House and its ancillary buildings, which scientists used as a laboratory for testing bomb components. 

List of thermodynamic properties<====>60037<====>List of thermodynamic properties Within thermodynamics, a physical property is any property that is measurable, and whose value describes a state of a physical system.  Some constants, such as the ideal gas constant, R, do not describe the state of a system, and so are not properties.   On the other hand, some constants, such as K f  (the freezing point depression constant, or cryoscopic constant), depend on the identity of a substance, and so may be considered to describe the state of a system, and so may be considered physical properties. "Specific" properties are expressed on a per mass basis. 

Matera<====>60040<====>Matera  Matera (  or locally  ) is a city and a province in the region of Basilicata, in Southern Italy.  It is the capital of the province of Matera and the capital of Basilicata from 1663 to 1806.  The town lies in a small canyon carved out by the Gravina. Known as "la Città Sotterranea" (the Subterranean City), Matera is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, having been inhabited since the 10th millennium BC.   Its historical center "Sassi", along with the Park of the Rupestrian Churches, is considered a World Heritage Site by UNESCO since 1993. 

Willem Barentsz<====>60041<====>Willem Barentsz  Willem Barentsz ( ; anglicized as William Barents or Barentz) (c.  1550 – 20 June 1597) was a Dutch navigator, cartographer, and Arctic explorer.  He went on three expeditions to the far north in search for a Northeast passage.  During his third expedition, the crew was stranded on Novaya Zemlya for almost a year.  Barentsz died on the return voyage in 1597.  In the 19th century, the Barents Sea was named after him. Life and careerWillem Barentsz was born around 1550 on the island Terschelling in the Seventeen Provinces, present-day Netherlands.Barentsz was not his surname but rather his patronymic name, short for Barentszoon "Barent's son". 

Saint Patrick's Battalion<====>60042<====>Saint Patrick's Battalion The Saint Patrick's Battalion ( ), formed and led by John Riley, was a unit of 175 to several hundred immigrants (accounts vary) and expatriates of European descent who fought as part of the Mexican Army against the United States in the Mexican–American War of 1846–8.  Most of the battalion's members had deserted or defected from the United States Army.  The Battalion served as an artillery unit for much of the war.  Despite later being formally designated as two infantry companies, it still retained artillery pieces throughout the conflict.  In many ways, the battalion acted as the sole Mexican counterbalance to the recent U.

Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa<====>60045<====>Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa Misión San Luís Obispo de Tolosa is a Spanish mission founded in 1772 by Father Junípero Serra in the present-day city of San Luis Obispo, California.  Named after Saint Louis of Anjou, the bishop of Toulouse, the mission is the namesake of the city of San Luis Obispo and San Luis Obispo County. The Mission church of San Luis Obispo is unusual in its design in that its combination of belfry and vestibule is found nowhere else among the California missions.  The main nave is short and narrow (as is the case with other mission churches), but at San Luis Obispo there is a secondary nave of almost equal size situated to the right of the altar, making this the only L-shaped mission church among all of the California missions.

HistoryThe settlement was named for St.  Francis of Assisi, the founder of the Franciscan Order, but was also commonly known as "Mission Dolores" owing to the presence of a nearby creek named Arroyo de Nuestra Señora de los Dolores, meaning "Our Lady of Sorrows Creek.

Named for Giovanni de  Capistrano, a 15th-century theologian and "warrior priest" who resided in the Abruzzo region of Italy, San Juan Capistrano has the distinction of being home to the oldest building in California still in use, a chapel built in 1782.  Known alternately as "Serra's Chapel" and "Father Serra's Church," it is the only extant structure where it has been documented that Junipero Serra celebrated Mass. 

Mission Santa Clara de Asís<====>60053<====>Mission Santa Clara de Asís  Mission Santa Clara de Asís is a Spanish mission founded by the Franciscan order in the present-day city of Santa Clara, California.  The mission, the eighth in California, was founded on January 12, 1777 and named for Saint Clare of Assisi, the foundress of the order of the Poor Clares.  It is the namesake of both the city and county of Santa Clara, as well as Santa Clara University, which was built around the mission.  This was the first California mission to be named in honor of a woman and the only one now located on a university campus. 

Mission San Buenaventura<====>60054<====>Mission San Buenaventura Mission San Buenaventura is a Spanish mission founded by the Franciscans in present-day Ventura, California.  Founded on March 31, 1782, it was the ninth Spanish mission established in California and the last to be established by Father Junípero Serra.  The mission was named after Saint Bonaventure, a 13th century Franciscan saint and Doctor of the Church.  The mission is  located in the historic downtown of Ventura. Mission San Buenaventura was planned to be founded in 1770, but the founding was delayed because of the low availability of the military escorts needed to establish the mission.

The Mission grounds occupy a rise between the Pacific Ocean and the Santa Ynez Mountains, and were consecrated by Father Fermín Lasuén, who had taken over the presidency of the California mission chain upon the death of Father Presidente Junípero Serra. 

Psilocybe cubensis<====>60059<====>Psilocybe cubensis   Psilocybe cubensis is a species of psychedelic mushroom whose principal active compounds are psilocybin and psilocin.  Commonly called shrooms, magic mushrooms, golden tops, cubes, or gold caps, it belongs to the Hymenogastraceae family of fungi and was previously known as Stropharia cubensis.   It is the most well known psilocybin mushroom due to its wide distribution and ease of cultivation. Taxonomy and namingThe species was first described in 1906 as Stropharia cubensis by Franklin Sumner Earle in Cuba.In 1907 it was identified as Naematoloma caerulescens in Tonkin by Narcisse Théophile Patouillard,    while in 1941 it was called Stropharia cyanescens by William Alphonso Murrill in Florida. 

La Purisima Mission<====>60060<====>La Purisima Mission  Mission La Purisima Concepción, or La Purisima Mission (originally La Misión de La Purísima Concepción de la Santísima Virgen María, or The Mission of the Immaculate Conception of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary) is a Spanish mission in Lompoc, California.  It was established on December 8, 1787 (the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, hence the mission's name) by the Franciscan order.  The original mission complex south of Lompoc was destroyed by an earthquake in 1812, and the mission was rebuilt at its present site several miles to the northwest. The mission is part of the larger La Purísima Mission State Historic Park, part of the California State Parks system, and along with Mission San Francisco de Solano is one of only two of the Spanish missions in California that is no longer under the control of the Catholic Church.

The mission was founded in 1791 and named for the feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, adopting the name given to a nearby creek by the missionary priest Juan Crespi, who accompanied the explorer Gaspar de Portolá when he camped on the banks of the San Lorenzo River on October 17, 1769.  Yenne, p.  112 As with the other California missions, Mission Santa Cruz served as a site for ecclesiastical conversion of natives, first the Ohlone, the original inhabitants of the region, and later the Yokuts from the east. 

Mission Nuestra Señora de la Soledad<====>60064<====>Mission Nuestra Señora de la Soledad Mission Nuestra Señora de la Soledad, known colloquially as the Soledad Mission  or Mission Soledad,  is a Spanish mission located near the present-day town of Soledad, California.  The mission was founded by the Franciscan order on October 9, 1791 to convert the Native Americans living in the area to Catholicism.  It was the thirteenth of California's Spanish missions, and is named for Mary, Our Lady of Solitude.   The town of Soledad is named for the mission. After the 1835 secularization of the mission and the later sale of building materials, the mission fell into a state of disrepair and soon after was left in ruins. 

Mission San José (California)<====>60066<====>Mission San José (California) Mission San José is a Spanish mission located in the present-day city of Fremont, California.  It was founded on June 11, 1797, by the Franciscan order and was the fourteenth Spanish mission established in California.  The mission is the namesake of the Mission San José district of Fremont, which was an independent town subsumed into the city when it was incorporated in 1957. The Mission entered a long period of gradual decline after Mexican secularization act of 1833.  Though numerous restoration efforts in the intervening periods have reconstructed many of the original structures. 

Maildir<====>60067<====>MaildirThe Maildir e-mail format is a common way of storing e-mail messages, where each message is kept in a separate file with a unique name, and each folder is a directory.   The local filesystem handles file locking as messages are added, moved and deleted.  A major design goal of Maildir is to eliminate program code having to handle locking, which is often difficult. SpecificationsA Maildir directory (often named  Maildir ) usually has three subdirectories named  tmp ,  new , and  cur . MaildirThe original Maildir specification was written by Daniel J.  Bernstein, the author of qmail, djbdns, and other software. 

Mission San Juan Bautista<====>60068<====>Mission San Juan Bautista  Mission San Juan Bautista is a Spanish mission in San Juan Bautista, San Benito County, California.  Founded on June 24, 1797 by Fermín Lasuén of the Franciscan order, the mission was the fifteenth of the Spanish missions established in present-day California.  Named for Saint John the Baptist, the mission is the namesake of the city of San Juan Bautista. Barracks for the soldiers, a nunnery, the Jose Castro House, and other buildings were constructed around a large grassy plaza in front of the church and can be seen today in their original form.

Mission San Miguel Arcángel<====>60072<====>Mission San Miguel Arcángel  Mission San Miguel Arcángel is a Spanish mission in San Miguel, San Luis Obispo County, California.  It was established on July 25, 1797 by the Franciscan order, on a site chosen specifically due to the large number of Salinan Indians that inhabited the area, whom the Spanish priests wanted to evangelize. The mission remains in use as a parish church of the Diocese of Monterey.  After being closed to the public for six years due to the 2003 San Simeon earthquake, the church reopened on September 29, 2009.  Inside the church are murals designed by Esteban Munras. 

Unknot<====>60075<====>Unknot The unknot arises in the mathematical theory of knots.  Intuitively, the unknot is a closed loop of rope without a knot in it.  A knot theorist would describe the unknot as an image of any embedding that can be deformed, i. e.  ambient-isotoped, to the standard unknot, i. e.  the embedding of the circle as a geometrically round circle.  The unknot is also called the trivial knot.  An unknot is the identity element with respect to the knot sum operation. Unknotting problem Deciding if a particular knot is the unknot was a major driving force behind knot invariants, since it was thought this approach would possibly give an efficient algorithm to recognize the unknot from some presentation such as a knot diagram. 

Mission San Fernando Rey de España<====>60076<====>Mission San Fernando Rey de España  Mission San Fernando Rey de España is a Spanish mission in the Mission Hills district of Los Angeles, California.  The mission was founded on September 8, 1797, and was the seventeenth of the twenty-one Spanish missions established in Alta California.  Named for Saint Ferdinand, the mission is the namesake of the nearby city of San Fernando and the San Fernando Valley. The mission was secularized in 1834 and returned to the Catholic Church in 1861; it became a working church in 1920.  Today the mission grounds function as a museum; the church is a chapel of ease of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. 

Mission San Luis Rey de Francia<====>60078<====>Mission San Luis Rey de Francia  Mission San Luis Rey de Francia is a former Spanish mission in an unincorporated part of San Diego County, surrounded by the present-day city of Oceanside, California, United States.  The mission was founded on June 13, 1798 by Padre Fermín Lasuén, and was the eighteenth of the Spanish missions established in California.  Named for Saint Louis, the mission lent its name to the Luiseño tribe of Mission Indians. The current church, built in 1811, is the third church on this location. It is a National Historic Landmark, for its pristine example of a Spanish mission church complex. 

Mission Santa Inés<====>60080<====>Mission Santa Inés Mission Santa Inés (sometimes spelled Santa Ynez) is a Spanish mission in the present-day city of Solvang, California, and named after St.  Agnes of Rome.  Founded on September 17, 1804 by Father Estévan Tapís of the Franciscan order, the mission site was chosen as a midway point between Mission Santa Barbara and Mission La Purísima Concepción, and was designed to relieve overcrowding at those two missions and to serve the Indians living east of the Coast Range. The mission was home to the first learning institution in Alta California Ruscin, p.  196  and today serves as a museum as well as a parish church of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. 

Mission San Rafael Arcángel<====>60082<====>Mission San Rafael Arcángel Mission San Rafael Arcángel was founded in 1817 as a medical asistencia ("sub-mission") of Mission San Francisco de Asís.  It was a hospital to treat sick Native Americans, making it Alta California's first sanitarium.   The weather was much better than in San Francisco, which helped the ill get better. It was not intended to be a stand-alone mission, but nevertheless grew and prospered and was granted full mission status on October 19, 1822. HistoryMission San Rafael Arcángel was founded in the present day location of San Rafael, California, on December 14, 1817, by Father Vicente Francisco de Sarría, as a medical asistencia ("sub-mission") of the San Francisco Mission to treat their sick population. 

Lapidary<====>60083<====>Lapidary  A lapidary (lapidarist,  ) is an artist or artisan who forms stone, minerals, or gemstones into decorative items such as cabochons, engraved gems, including cameos, and faceted designs.  The primary techniques employed are cutting, grinding, and polishing.  Carving is an important, but specialised technique.  Hardstone carving is the term used in art history for objects produced by the specialised carving techniques, and the techniques themselves.  Diamond cutters are generally not referred to as lapidaries, due to the specialized techniques which are required to work diamond. 

Mission San Francisco Solano (California)<====>60084<====>Mission San Francisco Solano (California)  Mission San Francisco Solano was the 21st, last and northernmost mission in Alta California.    It was the only mission built in Alta California after Mexico gained independence from Spain.  The difficulty of its beginning demonstrates the confusion resulting from that change in governance.   The California Governor wanted a robust Mexican presence north of the San Francisco Bay to keep the Russians who had established Fort Ross on the Pacific coast from moving further inland.   A young Franciscan friar from Mission San Francisco de Asis wanted to move to a location with a better climate and access to a larger number of potential converts. 

USS Gato<====>60085<====>USS Gato USS Gato has been the name of more than one United States Navy ship, and may refer to: , a submarine in commission from 1941 to 1946 , a submarine in commission from 1968 to 1996 DEFAULTSORT

Vaporware<====>60087<====>Vaporware  In the computer industry, vaporware  (Brit.  vapourware) is a product, typically computer hardware or software, that is announced to the general public but is never actually manufactured nor officially cancelled.  Use of the word has broadened to include products such as automobiles. Vaporware is often announced months or years before its purported release, with few details about its development being released.  Developers have been accused of intentionally promoting vaporware to keep customers from switching to competing products that offer more features.   Network World magazine called vaporware an "epidemic" in 1989, and blamed the press for not investigating whether developers' claims were true. 

Roentgenium<====>60088<====>Roentgenium  Roentgenium is a chemical element with symbol Rg and atomic number 111.  It is an extremely radioactive synthetic element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature.  The most stable known isotope, roentgenium-282, has a half-life of 2. 1 minutes, although the unconfirmed roentgenium-286 may have a longer half-life of about 10. 7 minutes.  Roentgenium was first created in 1994 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany.  It is named after the physicist Wilhelm Röntgen (also spelled Roentgen). In the periodic table, it is a d-block transactinide element. 

Terry Bradshaw<====>60089<====>Terry Bradshaw  Terry Paxton Bradshaw (born September 2, 1948) is a former American football quarterback who played professionally in the National Football League (NFL).  Since 1994, he has been a TV sports analyst and co-host of Fox NFL Sunday.  Bradshaw is also an actor, having participated in many television shows and films, most notably starring in the movie Failure to Launch.  He played for 14 seasons with Pittsburgh, won four Super Bowl titles in a six-year period (1974, 1975, 1978, and 1979), becoming the first quarterback to win three and four Super Bowls, and led the Steelers to eight AFC Central championships. 

Enzo Ferrari<====>60090<====>Enzo Ferrari   Enzo Anselmo Ferrari,  Cavaliere di Gran Croce OMRI   ( ; 18 February 1898  – 14 August 1988) was an Italian motor racing driver and entrepreneur, the founder of the Scuderia Ferrari Grand Prix motor racing team, and subsequently of the Ferrari automobile marque.  He was widely known as "il Commendatore" or "il Drake".  In his final years he was often referred to as "l'Ingegnere" (the Engineer) or "il Grande Vecchio (the Great Old Man)". Early lifeFerrari was born on 18 February 1898 in Modena, Italy.  His birth certificate had recorded his birth date on 20 February because a heavy snowstorm had prevented his father from reporting the birth at the local registry office. 

Promiscuity<====>60094<====>PromiscuityPromiscuity is the practice of having casual sex frequently with different partners or being indiscriminate in the choice of sexual partners.   The term can carry a moral judgment if the social ideal for sexual activity is monogamous relationships.  A common example of behavior viewed as promiscuous by many cultures is the one-night stand, and its frequency is used by researchers as a marker for promiscuity.  What sexual behavior is considered promiscuous varies between cultures, as does the prevalence of promiscuity.  Different standards are often applied to different genders and civil statuses.  Feminists have traditionally argued a significant double standard exists between how men and women are judged for promiscuity. 

Topological ring<====>60097<====>Topological ringIn mathematics, a topological ring is a ring R which is also a topological space such that both the addition and the multiplication are continuous as mapsR × R → R,where R × R carries the product topology.  That means R is an additive topological group and a multiplicative topological semigroup. General commentsThe group of units R ×  of R is a topological group when endowed with the topology coming from the embedding of R ×  into the product R × R as (x,x −1 ).  However, if the unit group is endowed with the subspace topology as a subspace of R, it may not be a topological group, because inversion on R ×  need not be continuous with respect to the subspace topology. 

Attack on Pearl Harbor<====>60098<====>Attack on Pearl Harbor   The attack on Pearl Harbor was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii Territory, on the morning of December 7, 1941.  The attack, also known as the Battle of Pearl Harbor,  led to the United States' entry into World War II.  The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI,   and as Operation Z during its planning.  Japan intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the U. 

Not invented here<====>60102<====>Not invented hereNot invented here (NIH) is a stance adopted by social, corporate, or institutional cultures that avoid using or buying already existing products, research, standards, or knowledge because of their external origins and costs, such as royalties. The reasons for not wanting to use the work of others are varied, but some can include a desire to support a local economy instead of paying royalties to a foreign license-holder, fear of patent infringement, lack of understanding of the foreign work, an unwillingness to acknowledge or value the work of others, jealousy, or forming part of a wider  . 

Dot matrix<====>60107<====>Dot matrix A dot matrix is a 2-dimensional patterned array, used to represent characters, symbols and images.  Every type of modern technology uses dot matrices for display of information, including cell phones, televisions, and printers.  They are also used in textiles with sewing, knitting, and weaving. An alternate form of information display using lines and curves is known as a vector display, was used with early computing devices such as air traffic control radar displays and pen-based plotters but is no longer used.  Electronic vector displays were typically monochrome only, and either don't fill in the interiors of closed vector shapes, or shape-filling is slow, time-consuming, and often non-uniform, as on pen-based plotters. 

Rasterisation<====>60108<====>Rasterisation Rasterisation (or rasterization) is the task of taking an image described in a vector graphics format (shapes) and converting it into a raster image (pixels or dots) for output on a video display or printer, or for storage in a bitmap file format.  It refers to both rasterisation of models and 2D rendering primitives such as polygons, line segments, etc. In normal usage, the term refers to the popular rendering algorithm for displaying 3D models on a computer.  Rasterisation is currently the most popular technique for producing real-time 3D computer graphics.  Real-time applications need to respond immediately to user input, and generally need to produce frame rates of at least 25 frames per second to achieve smooth animation. 

HP-GL<====>60111<====>HP-GL HP-GL (Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language; often written as HPGL) is a printer control language created by Hewlett-Packard (HP).  HP-GL was the primary printer control language used by HP plotters.   It later became a standard for almost all plotters.  Hewlett-Packard's printers also usually support HP-GL/2 in addition to PCL.  DesignThe language is formed from a series of two letter codes, followed by optional parameters.  For instance an arc can be drawn on a page by sending the string: AA100,100,50; This means Arc Absolute, and the parameters place the center of the arc at absolute coordinates 100,100 on the page, with a starting angle of 50 degrees measured counter-clockwise. 

Battle of Midway<====>60112<====>Battle of Midway  The Battle of Midway was a decisive naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II which occurred between 4 and 7 June 1942, only six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea.    The United States Navy under Admirals Chester Nimitz, Frank Jack Fletcher, and Raymond A.  Spruance defeated an attacking fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy under Admirals Isoroku Yamamoto, Chuichi Nagumo, and Nobutake Kondo near Midway Atoll, inflicting devastating damage on the Japanese fleet that proved irreparable. 

Escape sequence<====>60114<====>Escape sequence  An escape sequence is a series of characters used to change the state of computers and their attached peripheral devices.  These are also known as control sequences, reflecting their use in device control.   Some control sequences are special characters that always have the same meaning.  Escape sequences use an escape character to change the meaning of the characters which follow it, meaning that the characters can be interpreted as a command to be executed rather than as data. Escape sequences are commonly used when a computer and a peripheral have only a single channel through which to send information back and forth. 

Eadweard Muybridge<====>60115<====>Eadweard Muybridge   Eadweard Muybridge ( ; 9 April 1830 – 8 May 1904, born Edward James Muggeridge) was an English photographer important for his pioneering work in photographic studies of motion, and early work in motion-picture projection.  He adopted the first name Eadweard as the original Anglo-Saxon form of Edward, and the surname Muybridge believing it to be similarly archaic.  At age 20, he emigrated to America as a bookseller, first to New York, and then to San Francisco.  Planning a return trip to Europe in 1860, he suffered serious head injuries in a stagecoach crash in Texas. 

George Eastman<====>60116<====>George Eastman  George Eastman  (July 12, 1854 – March 14, 1932) was an American entrepreneur who founded the Eastman Kodak Company and popularized the use of roll film, helping to bring photography to the mainstream.  Roll film was also the basis for the invention of motion picture film stock in 1888 by the world's first film-makers Eadweard Muybridge and Louis Le Prince, and a few years later by their followers Léon Bouly, William Kennedy Dickson, Thomas Edison, the Lumière Brothers, and Georges Méliès. He was a major philanthropist, establishing the Eastman School of Music, and schools of dentistry and medicine at the University of Rochester and in London Eastman Dental Hospital; contributing to the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and the construction of several buildings at the second campus of Massachusetts Institute of Technology on the Charles River. 

Juno Beach<====>60117<====>Juno Beach    Juno or Juno Beach was one of five beaches of the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944 during the Second World War.  The beach spanned from Courseulles, a village just east of the British beach Gold, to Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, just west of the British beach Sword.  Taking Juno was the responsibility of the Canadian Army, with sea transport, mine sweeping, and a naval bombardment force provided by the Royal Canadian Navy and the British Royal Navy as well as elements from the Free French, Norwegian, and other Allied navies. 

Omaha Beach<====>60120<====>Omaha Beach  Omaha, commonly known as Omaha Beach, was the code name for one of the five sectors of the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in the Normandy landings on June 6, 1944, during World War II.  'Omaha' refers to a section of the coast of Normandy, France, facing the English Channel   long, from east of Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes to west of Vierville-sur-Mer on the right bank of the Douve River estuary and an estimated   tall cliffs.  Landings here were necessary to link the British landings to the east at Gold with the American landing to the west at Utah, thus providing a continuous lodgement on the Normandy coast of the Bay of the Seine. 

Operation Fortitude<====>60121<====>Operation Fortitude   Operation Fortitude was the code name for a World War II military deception employed by the Allied nations as part of an overall deception strategy (code named Bodyguard) during the build-up to the 1944 Normandy landings.  Fortitude was divided into two sub-plans, North and South, with the aim of misleading the German high command as to the location of the invasion. Both Fortitude plans involved the creation of phantom field armies (based in Edinburgh and the south of England) which threatened Norway (Fortitude North) and Pas de Calais (Fortitude South).  The operation was intended to divert Axis attention away from Normandy and, after the invasion on June 6, 1944, to delay reinforcement by convincing the Germans that the landings were purely a diversionary attack. 

Montmartre<====>60122<====>Montmartre  Montmartre ( ) is a large hill in Paris's 18th arrondissement.  It is   high and gives its name to the surrounding district, part of the Right Bank in the northern section of the city.  The historic district established by the City of Paris in 1995 is bordered by rue Caulaincourt and rue Custine on the north, rue de Clignancourt on the east, and boulevard de Clichy and boulevard de Rochechouart to the south,  containing  .   Montmartre is primarily known for its artistic history, the white-domed Basilica of the Sacré-Cœur on its summit, and as a nightclub district. 

Engraving<====>60125<====>Engraving    Engraving is the practice of incising a design onto a hard, usually flat surface by cutting grooves into it.  The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when silver, gold, steel, or glass are engraved, or may provide an intaglio printing plate, of copper or another metal, for printing images on paper as prints or illustrations; these images are also called engravings.  Wood engraving is a form of relief printing and is not covered in this article. Engraving was a historically important method of producing images on paper in artistic printmaking, in mapmaking, and also for commercial reproductions and illustrations for books and magazines. 

Foundation's Edge<====>60128<====>Foundation's Edge Foundation's Edge (1982) is a science fiction novel by American writer Isaac Asimov, the fourth book in the Foundation Series.  It was written more than thirty years after the stories of the original Foundation trilogy, due to years of pressure by fans and editors on Asimov to write another,  and, according to Asimov himself, the amount of the payment offered by the publisher.  It was his first novel to ever land on The New York Times best-seller list, after 262 books and 44 years of writing.  Foundation's Edge won both the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1983  and the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 1983,  and was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1982. 

The Caves of Steel<====>60129<====>The Caves of Steel   The Caves of Steel is a novel by American writer Isaac Asimov.  It is essentially a detective story, and illustrates an idea Asimov advocated, that science fiction can be applied to any literary genre, rather than just a limited genre. The book was first published as a serial in Galaxy magazine, from October to December 1953.  A Doubleday hardcover followed in 1954. A television adaptation was made by the BBC and shown in 1964: only a few short excerpts still exist.  In June 1989, the book was adapted by Bert Coules as a radio play for the BBC, with Ed Bishop as Elijah Baley and Sam Dastor as R. 

Prelude to Foundation<====>60130<====>Prelude to Foundation  Prelude to Foundation is a  novel  by American writer Isaac Asimov, published in 1988.  It is one of two prequels to the Foundation series.  For the first time, Asimov chronicles the fictional life of Hari Seldon, the man who invented psychohistory and the intellectual hero of the series.  The novel was nominated for the Locus Award.    Plot summaryPrelude to Foundation is set in the year 12,020 G. E.  (Galactic era), during the rocky reign of the Emperor Cleon I.  It starts with Seldon's presentation of a paper at a mathematics convention detailing how practical use of psychohistory might theoretically make it possible to predict the future. 

Foundation and Earth<====>60131<====>Foundation and Earth Foundation and Earth is a science fiction novel by American writer Isaac Asimov, the fifth novel of the Foundation series and chronologically the last in the series.  It was published in 1986, four years after the first sequel to the Foundation trilogy, which is titled Foundation's Edge. Plot introductionSeveral centuries after the events of Second Foundation, two citizens of the Foundation seek to find Earth, the legendary planet where humans are said to have originated.   Even less is known about Earth than was the case in Foundation, when scholars still seem to know the location of 'Sol'. 

Trantor<====>60132<====>Trantor   Trantor is a fictional planet in Isaac Asimov's Foundation Series and Empire series of science fiction novels. Trantor was first mentioned in Asimov's short story, "Black Friar of the Flame", later collected in The Early Asimov, Volume 1.  It was described as a human-settled planet in the part of the galaxy not ruled by an intelligent reptilian race (later defeated).  Later, Trantor gained prominence when the 1940s Foundation series first appeared in print (in the form of short stories).  Asimov described Trantor as being in the centre of the galaxy.  In later stories he acknowledged the growth in astronomical knowledge by retconning its position to be as close to the galactic center as was compatible with human habitability. 

Foundation series<====>60133<====>Foundation seriesDISPLAYTITLE The Foundation series is a science fiction book series written by American author Isaac Asimov.  For nearly thirty years, the series was a trilogy: Foundation, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation.  It won the one-time Hugo Award for "Best All-Time Series" in 1966.    Asimov began adding to the series in 1981, with two sequels: Foundation's Edge, Foundation and Earth, and two prequels: Prelude to Foundation, Forward the Foundation.  The additions made reference to events in Asimov's Robot and Empire series, indicating that they were also set in the same fictional universe. The premise of the series is that the mathematician Hari Seldon spent his life developing a branch of mathematics known as psychohistory, a concept of mathematical sociology. 

Robot series (Asimov)<====>60134<====>Robot series (Asimov) DISPLAYTITLEThe Robot series is a series of 38 science fiction short stories and 5 novels by American writer Isaac Asimov, featuring positronic robots. Short storiesMost of Asimov's robot short stories, which he began to write in 1939, are set in the first age of positronic robotics and space exploration.  The unique feature of Asimov's robots are the Three Laws of Robotics, hardwired in a robot's positronic brain, with which all robots in his fiction must comply, and which ensure that the robot does not turn against its creators. The stories were not initially conceived as a set, but rather all feature his positronic robots—indeed, there are some inconsistencies among them, especially between the short stories and the novels. 

Galactic Empire (series)<====>60135<====>Galactic Empire (series)  The Galactic Empire series (also called the Empire novels or trilogy) is a science fiction sequence of three of Isaac Asimov's earliest novels, and extended by one short story.  They are connected by their early place in his published works and chronological placement within his overarching Foundation Universe, set around the rise of Asimov's Galactic Empire, between the Robot and Foundation series to which they were linked in Asimov's later novels. Works in the seriesIn order of internal chronology the Empire series consists of:The Stars, Like Dust (1951)The Currents of Space (1952)Pebble in the Sky (1950), his first novel"Blind Alley" (1945), a short story also set between the Robot and Foundation series(Although, it is to be noted that Asimov stated in 1988 in the "Author's Note" to Prelude to Foundation that book #6 was "The Currents of Space" (1952) and that this was "the first of my Empire novels" and that book #7 was "The Stars, Like Dust" (1951), which was "The second Empire novel". 

Three Laws of Robotics<====>60136<====>Three Laws of Robotics The Three Laws of Robotics (often shortened to The Three Laws or known as Asimov's Laws) are a set of rules devised by the science fiction author Isaac Asimov.  The rules were introduced in his 1942 short story "Runaround" (included in the 1950 collection I, Robot), although they had been foreshadowed in a few earlier stories.  The Three Laws, quoted as being from the "Handbook of Robotics, 56th Edition, 2058 A. D. ", are:A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. A robot must obey the ordersby human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 

Wilson's disease<====>60138<====>Wilson's disease   Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder in which copper builds up in the body.   Symptoms are typically related to the brain and liver.   Liver related symptoms include vomiting, weakness, fluid build up in the abdomen, swelling of the legs, yellowish skin, and itchiness.   Brain related symptoms include tremors, muscle stiffness, trouble speaking, personality changes, anxiety, and seeing or hearing things that others do not.Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive condition due to a mutation in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene.   For a person to be affected they must inherit an affected copy of the gene from each parent.

The first half of the book takes the form of several novellas connected by Lazarus's retrospective narrative.  In the framing story, Lazarus has decided that life is no longer worth living, but (in what is described as a reverse Arabian Nights scenario) agrees not to end his life for as long as his companion, chief executive of the Howard families, and descendant Ira Weatherall, will listen to his stories. 

Sjögren syndrome<====>60140<====>Sjögren syndrome   Sjögren syndrome (SjS, SS) is a long-term autoimmune disease in which the moisture-producing glands of the body are affected.This results primarily in the development of a dry mouth and dry eyes.   Other symptoms can include dry skin, a chronic cough, vaginal dryness, numbness in the arms and legs, feeling tired, muscle and joint pains, and thyroid problems.   Those affected are at an increased risk (5%) of lymphoma. While the exact cause is unclear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetics and an environmental trigger such as exposure to a virus or bacteria. 

Battle of Tannenberg<====>60142<====>Battle of Tannenberg   The Battle of Tannenberg was fought between Russia and Germany from 26–30 August 1914, during the first month of World War I.  The battle resulted in the almost complete destruction of the Russian Second Army and the suicide of its commanding general, Alexander Samsonov.  A series of follow-up battles (First Masurian Lakes) destroyed most of the First Army as well and kept the Russians off balance until the spring of 1915.  The battle is particularly notable for fast rail movements by the Germans, enabling them to concentrate against each of the two Russian armies in turn, and also for the failure of the Russians to encode their radio messages. 

Roy Lichtenstein<====>60143<====>Roy Lichtenstein  Roy Fox Lichtenstein (pronounced  ; October 27, 1923 – September 29, 1997) was an American pop artist.  During the 1960s, along with Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, and James Rosenquist among others, he became a leading figure in the new art movement.  His work defined the premise of pop art through parody.   Inspired by the comic strip, Lichtenstein produced precise compositions that documented while they parodied, often in a tongue-in-cheek manner.  His work was influenced by popular advertising and the comic book style.  He described pop art as "not 'American' painting but actually industrial painting".

State fair<====>60156<====>State fair A state fair is an annual competitive and recreational gathering of a U. S.  state's population, usually held in late summer or early fall.   It is a larger version of a county fair, often including only exhibits or competitors that have won in their categories at the more-local county fairs. State fairs began in the nineteenth century for the purpose of promoting state agriculture, through competitive exhibitions of livestock and display of farm products.  As the U. S.  evolved from a predominantly agrarian to an industrial society in the twentieth century, and the more service economy of the 21st century,  modern state fairs have expanded to include carnival amusement rides and games, display of industrial products, automobile racing, and entertainment such as musical concerts.

Raymond Chandler's character Philip Marlowe, for instance, was strongly influenced by Hammett's Spade.  Spade was a departure from Hammett's nameless detective, The Continental Op.  Spade combined several features of previous detectives, notably his cold detachment, keen eye for detail, unflinching, sometimes ruthless, determination to achieve his own form of justice, and a complete lack of sentimentality. 

Tidal locking<====>60162<====>Tidal lockingTidal locking (also called gravitational locking or captured rotation) occurs when the long-term interaction between a pair of co-orbiting astronomical bodies drives the rotation rates into a harmonic ratio with the orbital period.  This effect arises from the gravitational gradient (tidal force) between the co-orbiting bodies, acting over a sufficiently long period of time.  Once tidal locking is achieved for one of the bodies, there is no more net transfer of angular momentum between the two objects, although there can be some back and forth transfer over the course of an orbit.  In the special case where the orbital eccentricity is nearly zero, tidal locking results in one hemisphere of the revolving object constantly facing its partner, an effect known as synchronous rotation. 

It's a Wonderful Life<====>60164<====>It's a Wonderful Life   It's a Wonderful Life is a 1946 American Christmas fantasy comedy-drama film produced and directed by Frank Capra, based on the short story and booklet The Greatest Gift, which Philip Van Doren Stern wrote in 1939 and published privately in 1945.

Intel MCS-51<====>60225<====>Intel MCS-51The Intel MCS-51 (commonly termed 8051) is an internally Harvard architecture, complex instruction set computer (CISC) instruction set, single chip microcontroller (µC) series developed by Intel in 1980 for use in embedded systems.   Intel's original versions were popular in the 1980s and early 1990s and enhanced binary compatible derivatives remain popular today. Intel's original MCS-51 family was developed using N-type metal-oxide-semiconductor (NMOS) technology like its predecessor Intel MCS-48, but later versions, identified by a letter C in their name (e. g. , 80C51) used complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technology and consume less power than their NMOS predecessors.  This made them more suitable for battery-powered devices. 

Relationships between Jewish religious movements<====>60226<====>Relationships between Jewish religious movements   The relationships between the various denominations of American Judaism can be conciliatory, welcoming, or even antagonistic. Orthodox Judaism Orthodox Judaism holds that both Conservative and Reform Judaism have made major and unjustifiable breaks with historic Judaism, both by their skepticism of the verbal revelation of Written and Oral Torah, and by their rejection of halakhic (Jewish legal) precedent as binding (though to varying degrees).  It views Pluralism as a construct of the liberal movements and does not see their ideology as rooted in historic Jewish norms.  While not recognizing Reform and Conservative as valid expressions of Judaism, it recognizes most who are affiliated with these movements as full-fledged Jews, aside from those whose Judaism is of patrilineal descent and/or were converted under Conservative or Reform auspices. 

Intel MCS-48<====>60228<====>Intel MCS-48The MCS-48 microcontroller (µC) series, Intel's first microcontroller, was originally released in 1976.  Its first members were 8048, 8035 and 8748.  Initially this family was produced using NMOS-technology, in the early 1980s it became available in CMOS-technology.  It was still manufactured into the 1990s to support older designs that still used it. The MCS-48 series has a modified Harvard architecture, with internal or external program ROM and 64–256 bytes of internal (on-chip) RAM.  The I/O is mapped into its own address space, separate from programs and data.  The 8048 is probably the most prominent member of Intel's MCS-48 family of microcontrollers.

Dugong<====>60244<====>Dugong    The dugong ( ,  ; Dugong dugon) is a medium-sized marine mammal.  It is one of four living species of the order Sirenia, which also includes three species of manatees.  It is the only living representative of the once-diverse family Dugongidae; its closest modern relative, Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas), was hunted to extinction in the 18th century.   The dugong is the only strictly marine herbivorous mammal. The dugong is the only sirenian in its range, which spans the waters of some 40 countries and territories throughout the Indo-West Pacific.  The dugong is largely dependent on seagrass communities for subsistence and is thus restricted to the coastal habitats which support seagrass meadows, with the largest dugong concentrations typically occurring in wide, shallow, protected areas such as bays, mangrove channels,  the waters of large inshore islands and inter-reefal waters. 

8.3 filename<====>60247<====>8. 3 filenameAn 8. 3 filename  (also called a short filename or SFN) is a filename convention used by old versions of DOS and versions of Microsoft Windows prior to Windows 95 and Windows NT 3. 5.  It is also used in modern Microsoft operating systems as an alternate filename to the long filename for compatibility with legacy programs.  The filename convention is limited by the FAT file system.  Similar 8. 3 file naming schemes have also existed on earlier CP/M, TRS-80, Atari, and some Data General and Digital Equipment Corporation minicomputer operating systems. Overview8. 3 filenames are limited to at most eight characters (after any directory specifier), followed optionally by a filename extension consisting of a period  . 

IBM 8514<====>60249<====>IBM 8514  IBM 8514 is an IBM graphics computer display standard supporting a display resolution of 1024x768 pixels with 256 colors at 43. 5 Hz (interlaced; 87 fields per second), or 640x480 at 60 Hz (non-interlaced). 8514 usually refers to the display controller hardware (such as the 8514/A display adapter. )  However, IBM sold the companion CRT monitor (for use with the 8514/A) which carries the same designation, 8514. 8514 used a standardised programming interface called the "Adapter Interface" or AI.  This interface is also used by XGA, IBM Image Adapter/A, and clones of the 8514/A and XGA such as the ATI Technologies Mach 32 and IIT AGX. 

88open<====>60254<====>88openThe 88open Consortium Ltd.  was an industry standards group set up by Motorola in 1988 to standardize Unix systems on their Motorola 88000 RISC processor systems.   At its peak, it had a staff of 30 people and over 50 supporters.The effort was largely a failure, at least in terms of attracting attention to the 88000 platform, and the group folded as soon as Motorola turned their attention to the PowerPC.MembersMotorola provided 50% of the financial support for the consortium.  Early members were Data General, Convergent and Tektronics. 

California sea lion<====>60255<====>California sea lion  The California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) is a coastal eared seal native to western North America.  It is one of six species of sea lion.  Its natural habitat ranges from southeast Alaska to central Mexico, including the Gulf of California.  Sea lions are sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females, and have a thicker neck and protruding crest.  They mainly haul-out on sandy or rocky beaches, but they also frequent manmade environments such as marinas and wharves.  Sea lions feed on a number of species of fish and squid, and are preyed on by orcas and white sharks. 

Jean de La Fontaine<====>60256<====>Jean de La Fontaine   Jean de La Fontaine ( ; 8 July 1621 13 April 1695) was a French fabulist and one of the most widely read French poets of the 17th century.  He is known above all for his Fables, which provided a model for subsequent fabulists across Europe and numerous alternative versions in France, and in French regional languages. After a long period of royal suspicion, he was admitted to the French Academy and his reputation in France has never faded since.  Evidence of this is found in the many pictures and statues of the writer, as well as later depictions on medals, coins and postage stamps. 

Marine mammal<====>60257<====>Marine mammal Marine mammals are aquatic mammals that rely on the ocean and other marine ecosystems for their existence.  They include animals such as seals, whales, manatees, sea otters and polar bears.  They do not represent a distinct taxon or systematic grouping, but rather have a polyphyletic relation due to convergent evolution, as in they do not have an immediate common ancestor.  They are also unified by their reliance on the marine environment for feeding. Marine mammal adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle varies considerably between species.  Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers. 

Sea lion<====>60258<====>Sea lion    Sea lions are sea mammals characterized by external ear flaps, long foreflippers, the ability to walk on all fours, and short, thick hair, big chest and belly.  Together with the fur seals, they comprise the family Otariidae, eared seals, which contains six extant and one extinct species (the Japanese sea lion) in five genera.  Their range extends from the subarctic to tropical waters of the global ocean in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with the notable exception of the northern Atlantic Ocean.They have an average lifespan of 20–30 years.

Proper noun<====>60260<====>Proper noun  A proper noun is a noun that in its primary application refers to a unique entity, such as London, Jupiter, Sarah, or Microsoft, as distinguished from a common noun, which usually refers to a class of entities (city, planet, person, corporation), or non-unique instances of a specific class (a city, another planet, these persons, our corporation).    Some proper nouns occur in plural form (optionally or exclusively), and then they refer to groups of entities considered as unique (the Hendersons, the Everglades, the Azores, the Pleiades).  Proper nouns can also occur in secondary applications, for example modifying nouns (the Mozart experience; his Azores adventure), or in the role of common nouns (he's no Pavarotti; a few would-be Napoleons). 

Pinniped<====>60261<====>Pinniped   Pinnipeds,  commonly known as seals,  are a widely distributed and diverse clade of carnivorous, fin-footed, semiaquatic marine mammals.  They comprise the extant families Odobenidae (whose only living member is the walrus), Otariidae (the eared seals: sea lions and fur seals), and Phocidae (the earless seals, or true seals).  There are 33 extant species of pinnipeds, and more than 50 extinct species have been described from fossils.  While seals were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines, molecular evidence supports them as a monophyletic lineage (descended from one ancestral line).  Pinnipeds belong to the order Carnivora and their closest living relatives are bears and musteloids (weasels, raccoons, skunks, and red pandas), having diverged about 50 million years ago. 

Mephitidae<====>60264<====>Mephitidae Mephitidae is a family of mammals comprising the skunks and stink badgers.  They are noted for the great development of their anal scent glands, which they use to deter predators. There are twelve extant species of mephitids in four genera: Conepatus (hog-nosed skunks, four species); Mephitis (the hooded and striped skunks, two species); Mydaus (stink badgers, two species); and Spilogale (spotted skunks, four species).  The two stink badgers in the genus Mydaus inhabit Indonesia and the Philippines; the other members of the family inhabit the Americas, ranging from Canada to central South America.  All other mephitids are extinct, known through fossils, including those from Eurasia. 

Self (programming language)<====>60265<====>Self (programming language) Self is an object-oriented programming language based on the concept of prototypes.  Self began as a dialect of Smalltalk, being dynamically typed and using just-in-time compilation (JIT) as well as the prototype-based approach to objects: it was first used as an experimental test system for language design in the 1980s and 1990s.  In 2006, Self was still being developed as part of the Klein project, which was a Self virtual machine written fully in Self.  The latest version is 2017. 1 released in May 2017.  Several just-in-time compilation techniques were pioneered and improved in Self research as they were required to allow a very high level object oriented language to perform at up to half the speed of optimized C.

Fountain pen<====>60284<====>Fountain penA fountain pen is a nib pen that, unlike its predecessor, the dip pen, contains an internal reservoir of liquid ink.  The pen draws ink from the reservoir through a feed to the nib and deposits it on paper via a combination of gravity and capillary action.  Filling the reservoir with ink may be achieved manually, via the use of a Pasteur pipette (eyedropper) or syringe, or via an internal filling mechanism which creates suction (for example, through a piston mechanism) to transfer ink directly through the nib into the reservoir.  Some pens employ removable reservoirs in the form of pre-filled ink cartridges. 

Inkwell<====>60287<====>Inkwell   An inkwell is a small jar or container, often made of glass, porcelain, silver, brass, or pewter, used for holding ink in a place convenient for the person who is writing.  The artist or writer dips the brush, quill, or dip pen into the inkwell as needed or uses the inkwell as the source for filling the reservoir of a fountain pen.  An inkwell usually has a lid to prevent contamination, evaporation, accidental spillage, and excessive exposure to air.  A type known as the travelling inkwell was fitted with a secure, screw lid so a traveller could carry a supply of ink in their luggage without the risk of leakage. 

Pewter<====>60288<====>PewterPewter is a malleable metal alloy.   It is traditionally composed of 85–99% tin, mixed with copper, antimony, bismuth, and sometimes lead, although the use of lead is less common today.   Silver is also sometimes used.  Copper and antimony act as hardeners while lead is more common in the lower grades of pewter, which have a bluish tint.  Pewter has a low melting point, around  , depending on the exact mixture of metals.   The word pewter is probably a variation of the word spelter, a term for zinc alloys (originally a colloquial name for zinc). 

Homeobox<====>60289<====>Homeobox A homeobox is a DNA sequence, around 180 base pairs long, found within genes that are involved in the regulation of patterns of anatomical development (morphogenesis) in animals, fungi and plants.  These genes encode homeodomain protein products that are transcription factors sharing a characteristic protein fold structure that binds DNA.The "homeo-" prefix in the words "homeobox" and "homeodomain" stems from the mutational phenotype known as "homeosis", which is frequently observed when these genes are mutated in animals.  Homeosis is a term coined by William Bateson to describe the outright replacement of a discrete body part with another body part. 

Fisting<====>60290<====>Fisting  Fisting, handballing, fist-fucking, brachiovaginal, or brachioproctic insertion    is a sexual activity that involves inserting a hand into the vagina or rectum.  Once insertion is complete, the fingers are either clenched into a fist or kept straight.  Fisting may be performed without a partner, but it is most often a partnered activity. HistoryFisting's emergence as a popular sexual practice is commonly attributed to gay male culture, with the additional sentiment that it may not have existed until the twentieth century.    Robert Morgan Lawrence, a sex educator, however, believes the practice dates back thousands of years. 

Chasing Amy<====>60293<====>Chasing Amy Chasing Amy is a 1997 American romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Kevin Smith.  The film is about a male comic artist who falls in love with a lesbian woman, to the displeasure of his best friend.  It is the third film in Smith's View Askewniverse series. The film was originally inspired by a brief scene from an early movie by a friend of Smith's.  In Guinevere Turner's Go Fish, one of the lesbian characters imagines her friends passing judgment on her for "selling out" by sleeping with a man.  Kevin Smith was dating star Joey Lauren Adams at the time he was writing the script, which was also partly inspired by her. 

Kevin Smith<====>60296<====>Kevin Smith   Kevin Patrick Smith  (born August 2, 1970) is an American filmmaker, actor, comic book writer, author, and podcaster.  He came to prominence with the low-budget comedy film Clerks (1994), which he wrote, directed, co-produced, and acted in as the character Silent Bob of stoner duo Jay and Silent Bob.  Jay and Silent Bob have appeared in Smith's follow-up films Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back which were set primarily in his home state of New Jersey.  While not strictly sequential, the films frequently featured crossover plot elements, character references, and a shared canon described by fans as the "View Askewniverse", named after his production company View Askew Productions, which he co-founded with Scott Mosier. 

Steller sea lion<====>60298<====>Steller sea lion The Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) also known as the northern sea lion and Steller's sea lion, is a near threatened species of sea lions in the northern Pacific.  It is the sole member of the genus Eumetopias and the largest of the eared seals (Otariidae).  Among pinnipeds, it is inferior in size only to the walrus and the two elephant seals.  The species is named for the naturalist Georg Wilhelm Steller, who first described them in 1741.  The Steller sea lion has attracted considerable attention in recent decades due to significant, unexplained declines in their numbers over a large portion of their range in Alaska. 

So Far, So Good... So What!<====>60300<====>So Far, So Good. . .  So What!  So Far, So Good. . .  So What!

Youthanasia<====>60303<====>Youthanasia  Youthanasia is the sixth studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, released on November 1, 1994 through Capitol Records.  The album is not a large stylistic departure from the band's earlier recordings; however it marked the continuing evolution of Megadeth, following the footsteps of the previous album Countdown to Extinction (1992).  The album's title is a play on words, implying that society is euthanizing its youth.  The cover art features an elderly woman hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothesline; the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track. 

Hidden Treasures (EP)<====>60305<====>Hidden Treasures (EP)  Hidden Treasures is an EP by American thrash metal band Megadeth, released on July 18, 1995 by Capitol Records.

Self<====>60330<====>Self  Self is a reference by an individual to the same individual person.  This reference is necessarily subjective, thus self is a reference by a subject to the same subject.  The sense of having a self – or self-hood – should, however, not be confused with subjectivity itself.   Ostensibly, there is a directedness outward from the subject that refers inward, back to its "self" (or itself).  Examples of psychiatric conditions where such 'sameness' is broken include depersonalization, which sometimes occur in schizophrenia: the self appears different to the subject. The first-person perspective distinguishes self-hood from personal identity.

Asanga<====>60342<====>Asanga Asaṅga ( ,  ; Romaji: Mujaku) (fl.  4th century C. E. ) was a major exponent of the Yogacara tradition in India, also called Vijñānavāda.  Traditionally, he and his half-brother Vasubandhu are regarded as the founders of this school.  The two half-brothers were also major exponents of Abhidharma teachings. Early lifeAsaṅga was born as the son of a Kṣatriya father and Brahmin mother  in Puruṣapura (present day Peshawar in Pakistan), which at that time was part of the ancient kingdom of Gandhāra.  Current scholarship places him in the fourth century CE.  He was perhaps originally a member of the Mahīśāsaka school or the Mūlasarvāstivāda school but later converted to Mahāyāna. 

Sediment<====>60343<====>SedimentFor sediment in beverages, see  . Sediment is a naturally occurring material that is broken down by processes of weathering and erosion, and is subsequently transported by the action of wind, water, or ice, and/or by the force of gravity acting on the particles.  For example, sand and silt can be carried in suspension in river water and on reaching the sea be deposited by sedimentation and if buried this may eventually become sandstone and siltstone, ( sedimentary rocks). Sediments are most often transported by water (fluvial processes), but also wind (aeolian processes) and glaciers.  Beach sands and river channel deposits are examples of fluvial transport and deposition, though sediment also often settles out of slow-moving or standing water in lakes and oceans. 

Chandrakirti<====>60347<====>Chandrakirti Chandrakirti ( ;  ;  ;   ) was a Buddhist scholar of the Madhyamaka school and a noted commentator on the works of Nagarjuna ( ) and those of his main disciple, Aryadeva, authoring two influential works, Prasannapadā and Madhyamakāvatāra.   Very little is known about Chandrakirti's life.  Tibetan sources state that he was born in Samanta, South India.   and was a student of Kamalabuddhi.  He is traditionally associated with Nalanda Mahavihara where he may have been a monk.  Teachings and worksChandrakirti was the most famous member of what the Tibetans came to call the Uma Thelgyur ( ) school, an approach to the interpretation of Madhyamaka philosophy typically back-translated into Sanskrit as   or rendered in English as the "Consequentialist" or "Dialecticist" school. 

Amherst College<====>60355<====>Amherst College   Amherst College ( ) is a private liberal arts college located in Amherst, Massachusetts, United States.  Founded in 1821 as an attempt to relocate Williams College by its president, Zephaniah Swift Moore, Amherst is the third oldest institution of higher education in Massachusetts.   The institution was named after the town, which in turn had been named after Lord Jeffery Amherst.  Amherst was established as a men's college and became coeducational in 1975.  Amherst is an exclusively undergraduate four-year institution and enrolled 1,849 students in the fall of 2016. 

Albany, California<====>60356<====>Albany, California Albany is a city in Alameda County, California.  The population was 18,539 at the 2010 census. HistoryIn 1908, a group of local women protested the dumping of Berkeley garbage in their community.  Armed with two shotguns and a twenty-two-caliber rifle, they confronted the drivers of the wagons near what is now the corner of San Pablo Avenue and Buchanan Street.  The women told the drivers of the horse-drawn garbage wagons to go home, which they did quickly and without complaint.    Shortly thereafter, the residents of the town voted to incorporate as the City of Ocean View. 

Internal rate of return<====>60358<====>Internal rate of return  The internal rate of return (IRR) is a method of calculating rate of return.  The term internal refers to the fact that its calculation does not involve external factors, such as inflation or the cost of capital. It is also called the discounted cash flow rate of return (DCFROR).  Project Economics and Decision Analysis, Volume I: Deterministic Models, M. A. Main, Page 269 In the context of savings and loans, the IRR is also called the effective interest rate. DefinitionThe internal rate of return on an investment or project is the "annualized effective compounded return rate" or rate of return that sets the net present value of all cash flows (both positive and negative) from the investment equal to zero. 

Benthos<====>60359<====>BenthosBenthos is the community of organisms that live on, in, or near the seabed, also known as the benthic zone.  Benthos from the Census of Antarctic Marine Life website  This community lives in or near marine sedimentary environments, from tidal pools along the foreshore, out to the continental shelf, and then down to the abyssal depths. Many organisms adapted to deep-water pressure cannot survive in the upper parts of the water column.  The pressure difference can be very significant (approximately one atmosphere for each 10 metres of water depth). https://oceanservice. noaa. gov/facts/pressure. 

Anapsid<====>60360<====>Anapsid  An anapsid is an amniote whose skull does not have openings near the temples.   Traditionally, the Anapsida are the most primitive subclass of reptiles, the ancestral stock from which Synapsida and Diapsida evolved, making anapsids paraphyletic.  It is however doubtful that all anapsids lack temporal fenestra as a primitive trait, and that all the groups traditionally seen as anapsids truly lacked fenestra. Anapsids and the turtlesWhile "anapsid reptiles" or "anapsida" were traditionally spoken of as if they were a monophyletic group, it has been suggested that several groups of reptiles that had anapsid skulls might be only distantly related. 

Illyria<====>60361<====>Illyria  In classical antiquity, Illyria ( , Illyría or  , Illyrís;    ,  see also Illyricum) was a region in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula inhabited by the Illyrians. The prehistory of Illyria and the Illyrians is known from archaeological evidence.  The Romans conquered the region in 168 BC in the aftermath of the Illyrian Wars. The Roman term Illyris (distinct from Illyria) was sometimes used to define an area north of the Aous valley, most notably Illyris proper.  NameIn Greek mythology, the name of Illyria is aetiologically traced to Illyrius, the son of Cadmus and Harmonia, who eventually ruled Illyria and became the eponymous ancestor of the Illyrians. 

Mostly Harmless<====>60364<====>Mostly HarmlessMostly Harmless is a 1992 novel by Douglas Adams and the fifth book in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series.  It is described on the cover of the first editions as "The fifth book in the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhikers Trilogy".  It was the last Hitchhiker's book written by Adams and his final book released in his lifetime. TitleThe title derives from a joke early in the series, when Arthur Dent discovers that the entry for Earth in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy consists, in its entirety, of the word "Harmless". 

Front 242<====>60367<====>Front 242  Front 242 is a Belgian electronic music group that came into prominence during the 1980s.  Pioneering the style they called electronic body music, they were a profound influence on the electronic and industrial music genres.  HistoryFormationFront 242 were formed in 1981 in Aarschot, near Leuven, Belgium, by Daniel Bressanutti and Dirk Bergen, who wanted to create music and graphic design using emerging electronic tools.  The first single, "Principles", was released in 1981.The front part of the name comes from the idea of an organized popular uprising; the number "242" was chosen because it's "just sort of a design work". 

Jean-Luc Godard<====>60368<====>Jean-Luc Godard   Jean-Luc Godard ( ; born 3 December 1930) is a French-Swiss film director, screenwriter and film critic.  He rose to prominence as a pioneer of the 1960s French New Wave film movement.  Like his New Wave contemporaries, Godard criticized mainstream French cinema's "Tradition of Quality",  which "emphasized craft over innovation, privileged established directors over new directors, and preferred the great works of the past to experimentation. "  As a result of such argument, he and like-minded critics started to make their own films.   Many of Godard's films challenge the conventions of traditional Hollywood in addition to French cinema. 

Calamine (mineral)<====>60372<====>Calamine (mineral) Calamine is a historic name for an ore of zinc.   The name calamine was derived from lapis calaminaris, a Latin corruption of Greek cadmia (καδμία), the old name for zinc ores in general.  The name of the Belgian town of Kelmis, La Calamine in French, which was home to a zinc mine, comes from that.  In the 18th and 19th centuries large ore mines could be found near the German village of Breinigerberg. During the early 19th century it was discovered that what had been thought to be one ore was actually two distinct minerals:Zinc carbonate ZnCO 3  or smithsonite andZinc silicate Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2 ·H 2 O or hemimorphite. 

8-bit clean<====>60373<====>8-bit clean 8-bit clean describes a computer system that correctly handles 8-bit character encodings, such as the ISO 8859 series and the UTF-8 encoding of Unicode. HistoryUp to the early 1990s, many programs and data transmission channels assumed that all characters would be represented as numbers between 0 and 127 (7 bits); for example, the ASCII standard used only 7 bits per character, avoiding an 8-bit representation in order to save on data transmission costs.  On computers and data links using 8-bit bytes this left the top bit of each byte free for use as a parity, flag bit, or meta data control bit.

IBM 709/90 9PAC<====>60378<====>IBM 709/90 9PAC9PAC is a common abbreviation for 709 PACkage.  It was a report generator developed in 1959 for the IBM 709 and used on its successor, the IBM 7090.  It was developed by SHARE, an early IBM users' group, and based on the File Maintenance and Report Generator System developed by General Electric for the IBM 702, led by Harry Tellier.  Charles Bachman worked on its design in 1957, and although his company's order for the 709 was cancelled, he later included some of its general concepts into the more generalized idea of navigational databases. Engineers at companies such as Union Carbide, Northwest Power Company, Philips Petroleum, Dow Chemical, and Chrysler cooperated on the project. 

Aioli<====>60379<====>Aioli  Aioli or aïoli (  or  ; Provençalor aiòli   ;    ) is a Mediterranean sauce made of garlic and olive oil; some regions use other emulsifiers such as egg.  The names mean "garlic and oil" in Catalan and Provençal.  Its association is with the cuisines of the Mediterranean coasts of Spain (Valencia, Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, Murcia and eastern Andalusia), France (Provence) and Italy (Liguria, Sicily and Calabria).  Current versions of the French-Provençal sauce are closer to a garlic mayonnaise, incorporating egg yolks and lemon juice, whereas the original French-Provençal and Spanish Catalan versions are without egg yolk and have more garlic. 

A-0 System<====>60383<====>A-0 SystemThe A-0 system (Arithmetic Language version 0), written by Richard K.  Ridgway and Margaret H.  Harper  (managed by Grace Hopper) in 1951 and 1952 for the UNIVAC I, was an early  compiler related tool developed for electronic computers.   The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler.  A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and arguments.  The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code.  The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.

Under the British, it encompassed the current territorial limits excluding the princely state of Khairpur with the capital at Karachi.  After Pakistan's creation, the province lost the city of Karachi, as it became the capital of the newly created country. LocationThe province was bordered by Karachi (within The Federal Capital Territory after 1948) and the princely states of  Las Bela and Kalat on the west.   To the north were the provinces of Baluchistan and West Punjab.

A3D<====>60394<====>A3D   A3D (Aureal 3-Dimensional) was a technology developed by Aureal Semiconductor for use in their Vortex line of PC sound chips to deliver three-dimensional sound through headphones, two or even four speakers.    The technology used head-related transfer functions (HRTF), which the human ear interprets as spatial cues indicating the location of a particular sound source.   Many modern sound cards and PC games incorporated A3D via license from Aureal.  Due to Aureal's acquisition (see below) the A3D technology is now part of the intellectual property of Creative Labs. A3D differs from various forms of discrete positional audio in that it only requires two speakers, while surround sound typically requires more than four.

Steller's sea cow<====>60411<====>Steller's sea cow   Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas) is an extinct sirenian discovered by Europeans in 1741.  At that time, it was found only around the Commander Islands in the Bering Sea between Alaska and Russia; its range was more extensive during the Pleistocene epoch, and it is possible that the animal and humans previously interacted.  Eighteenth century adults would reach weights of   and lengths up to  . It was a part of the order Sirenia and a member of the family Dugongidae, of which its closest living relative, the   long dugong (Dugong dugon), is the sole surviving member. 

Susa<====>60413<====>Susa   Susa ( ;   Šušh;  ;   Šušān; Greek: Σοῦσα  ;   Šušh; Old Persian Çūšā) was an ancient city of the Proto-Elamite, Elamite, First Persian Empire, Seleucid, and Parthian empires of Iran, and one of the most important cities of the Ancient Near East.  It is located in the lower Zagros Mountains about   east of the Tigris River, between the Karkheh and Dez Rivers. The modern Iranian town of Shush is located at the site of ancient Susa.  Shush is the administrative capital of the Shush County of Iran's Khuzestan province. 

Battle of Maldon<====>60417<====>Battle of Maldon  The Battle of Maldon took place on 11 August 991 CE  near Maldon beside the River Blackwater in Essex, England, during the reign of Æthelred the Unready.   Earl Byrhtnoth and his thegns led the English against a Viking invasion.   The battle ended in an Anglo-Saxon defeat.   After the battle Archbishop Sigeric of Canterbury and the aldermen of the south-western provinces advised King Æthelred to buy off the Vikings rather than continue the armed struggle.   The result was a payment of 10,000 Roman pounds (3,300 kg) of silver, the first example of Danegeld in England. 

Battle of Badon<====>60422<====>Battle of Badon  The Battle of Badon (Latin: Bellum in monte Badonis or Mons Badonicus,  , all literally meaning "Battle of Mount Badon" or "Battle of Badon Hill") was a battle thought to have occurred between Celtic Britons and Anglo-Saxons in the late 5th or early 6th century.   It was credited as a major victory for the Britons, stopping the encroachment of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms for a period.  It is chiefly known today for the supposed involvement of King Arthur, a tradition that first clearly appeared in the 9th-century Historia Brittonum.  Because of the limited number of sources, there is no certainty about the date, location, or details of the fighting. 

Hallucigenia<====>60424<====>Hallucigenia   Hallucigenia is a genus of Cambrian xenusiids known from articulated fossils in Burgess Shale-type deposits in Canada and China, and from isolated   spines around the world.The generic name reflects the type species' unusual appearance and eccentric history of study; when it was erected as a genus, H.  sparsa was reconstructed upside down and back to front.  Hallucigenia is now recognized as a "lobopodian worm".  It is considered by some to represent an early ancestor of the living velvet worms, although other researchers favour a relationship closer to arthropods. 

Symbiogenesis<====>60426<====>SymbiogenesisSymbiogenesis, or endosymbiotic theory, is an evolutionary theory of the origin of eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic organisms, first articulated in 1905 and 1910 by the Russian botanist Konstantin Mereschkowski, and advanced and substantiated with microbiological evidence by Lynn Margulis in 1967.  It holds that the organelles distinguishing eukaryote cells evolved through symbiosis of individual single-celled prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea). The theory holds that mitochondria, plastids such as chloroplasts, and possibly other organelles of eukaryotic cells represent formerly free-living prokaryotes taken one inside the other in endosymbiosis, around 1. 5 billion years ago.  In more detail, mitochondria appear to be related to Rickettsiales proteobacteria, and chloroplasts to nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacteria.

Nuclear bunker buster<====>60433<====>Nuclear bunker buster  A nuclear bunker buster,  also known as an earth-penetrating weapon (EPW), is the nuclear equivalent of the conventional bunker buster.  The non-nuclear component of the weapon is designed to penetrate soil, rock, or concrete to deliver a nuclear warhead to an underground target.  These weapons would be used to destroy hardened, underground military bunkers or other below-ground facilities.  An underground explosion releases a larger fraction of its energy into the ground, compared to a surface burst or air burst explosion at or above the surface, and so can destroy an underground target using a lower explosive yield.

Line-of-sight propagation<====>60455<====>Line-of-sight propagation Line-of-sight propagation is a characteristic of electromagnetic radiation or acoustic wave propagation which means waves which travel in a direct path from the source to the receiver.   Electromagnetic transmission includes light emissions traveling in a straight line.  The rays or waves may be diffracted, refracted, reflected, or absorbed by the atmosphere and obstructions with material and generally cannot travel over the horizon or behind obstacles. In contrast to line-of-sight propagation, at low frequency (below approximately 3 MHz) due to diffraction radio waves can travel as ground waves, which follow the contour of the Earth.  This enables AM radio stations to transmit beyond the horizon. 

Abductive reasoning<====>60459<====>Abductive reasoning Abductive reasoning (also called abduction, For example:    abductive inference,  or retroduction ) is a form of logical inference which starts with an observation then seeks to find the simplest and most likely explanation.  In abductive reasoning, unlike in deductive reasoning, the premises do not guarantee the conclusion.  One can understand abductive reasoning as inference to the best explanation,  although not all uses of the terms abduction and inference to the best explanation are exactly equivalent.   In the 1990s, as computing power grew, the fields of law,  computer science, and artificial intelligence research  spurred renewed interest in the subject of abduction.

Application binary interface<====>60471<====>Application binary interfaceIn computer software, an application binary interface (ABI) is an interface between two program modules; often, one of these modules is a library or operating system facility, and the other is a program that is being run by a user. An ABI defines how data structures or computational routines are accessed in machine code, which is a low-level, hardware-dependent format; in contrast, an API defines this access in source code, which is a relatively high-level, relatively hardware-independent, often human-readable format.  A common aspect of an ABI is the calling convention, which determines how data is provided as input to or read as output from computational routines; examples are the x86 calling conventions. 

Augmented Backus–Naur form<====>60476<====>Augmented Backus–Naur formIn computer science, augmented Backus–Naur form (ABNF) is a metalanguage based on Backus–Naur form (BNF), but consisting of its own syntax and derivation rules.  The motive principle for ABNF is to describe a formal system of a language to be used as a bidirectional communications protocol.  It is defined by Internet Standard 68 ("STD 68", type case sic), which   is RFC 5234, and it often serves as the definition language for IETF communication protocols.  RFC 5234 supersedes RFC 4234 (which superseded RFC 2234 and RFC 733).RFC 7405 updates it, adding a syntax for specifying case-sensitive string literals. 

Abort (computing)<====>60478<====>Abort (computing)  In a computer or data transmission system, to abort means to terminate, usually in a controlled manner, a processing activity because it is impossible or undesirable for the activity to proceed.   Such an action may be accompanied by diagnostic information on the aborted process. In addition to being a verb, abort also has two noun senses.   In the most general case, the event of aborting can be referred to as an abort.   Sometimes the event of aborting can be given a special name, as in the case of an abort involving a Unix kernel where it is known as a kernel panic. 

Alternating bit protocol<====>60481<====>Alternating bit protocolAlternating bit protocol (ABP) is a simple network protocol operating at the data link layer that retransmits lost or corrupted messages using FIFO semantics.  It can be seen as a special case of a sliding window protocol where  a simple timer restricts the order of messages to ensure receivers send messages in turn while using a  window of 1 bit.  Messages are sent from transmitter A to receiver B.  Assume that the channel from A to B is initialized and that there are no messages in transit.   Each message from A to B contains a data part and a one-bit sequence number, i. 

Automatic baud rate detection<====>60486<====>Automatic baud rate detection Automatic baud rate detection on  UART (ABR, autobaud) refers to the process by which a receiving device (such as a modem) determines the speed, code level, start bit, and stop bits of incoming data by examining the first character, usually a preselected sign-on character (syncword).  ABR allows the receiving device to accept data from a variety of transmitting devices operating at different speeds without needing to establish data rates in advance. During the autobaud process, the baud rate of received character stream is determined byexamining the received pattern and its timing, and the length of a start bit. 

Abscissa and ordinate<====>60487<====>Abscissa and ordinateIn mathematics, the abscissa ( ; plural abscissae or abscissæ or abscissas) and the ordinate are respectively the first and second coordinate of a point in a coordinate system. The abscissa of a point is the signed measure of its projection on the primary axis, whose absolute value is the distance between the projection and the origin of the axis, and whose sign is given by the location on the projection relative to the origin (before: negative; after: positive). The ordinate of a point is the signed measure of its projection on the secondary axis, whose absolute value is the distance between the projection and the origin of the axis, and whose sign is given by the location on the projection relative to the origin (before: negative; after: positive). 

Abstract interpretation<====>60490<====>Abstract interpretation In computer science, abstract interpretation is a theory of sound approximation of the semantics of computer programs, based on monotonic functions over ordered sets, especially lattices.  It can be viewed as a partial execution of a computer program which gains information about its semantics (e. g. , control-flow, data-flow) without performing all the calculations. Its main concrete application is formal static analysis, the automatic extraction of information about the possible executions of computer programs; such analyses have two main usages:inside compilers, to analyse programs to decide whether certain optimizations or transformations are applicable;for debugging or even the certification of programs against classes of bugs. 

Abstraction (software engineering)<====>60491<====>Abstraction (software engineering)  In software engineering and computer science, abstraction is a technique for arranging complexity of computer systems.  It works by establishing a level of simplicity on which a person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current level.  The programmer works with an idealized interface (usually well defined) and can add additional levels of functionality that would otherwise be too complex to handle.  For an example, a programmer writing code that involves numerical operations may not be interested in the way numbers are represented in the underlying hardware (e. g. 

Abstract machine<====>60492<====>Abstract machine  An abstract machine, also called an abstract computer, is a theoretical model of a computer hardware or software system used in automata theory.  Abstraction of computing processes is used in both the computer science and computer engineering disciplines and usually assumes a discrete time paradigm. InformationIn the theory of computation, abstract machines are often used in thought experiments regarding computability or to analyze the complexity of algorithms (see computational complexity theory).  A typical abstract machine consists of a definition in terms of input, output, and the set of allowable operations used to turn the former into the latter.

General semantics<====>60524<====>General semantics  General semantics is a self improvement and therapy program begun in the 1920s that seeks to regulate human mental habits and behaviors.  After partial launches under the names human engineering and humanology,  Polish-American originator Alfred Korzybski    (1879–1950) fully launched the program as general semantics in 1933 with the publication of Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics. In Science and Sanity, general semantics is presented as both a theoretical and a practical system whose adoption can reliably alter human behavior in the direction of greater sanity.  In the 1947 preface to the third edition of Science and Sanity, Korzybski wrote: "We need not blind ourselves with the old dogma that 'human nature cannot be changed', for we find that it can be changed.

The main intention behind Newton project, was to develop a device capable of replacing a computer while being portable. With limited battery and memory, the developers were looking for programming language capable of meeting these challenges. 

Unique factorization domain<====>60546<====>Unique factorization domain In mathematics, a unique factorization domain (UFD) is an integral domain (a commutative ring in which the product of non-zero elements is non-zero) in which every non-zero non-unit element can be written as a product of prime elements (or irreducible elements), uniquely up to order and units, analogous to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic for the integers.   UFDs are sometimes called factorial rings, following the terminology of Bourbaki. Unique factorization domains appear in the following chain of class inclusions:  DefinitionFormally, a unique factorization domain is defined to be an integral domain R in which every non-zero element x of R can be written as a product (an empty product if x is a unit) of irreducible elements p i  of R and a unit u:x = u p 1  p 2  . 

Planetarium<====>60548<====>Planetarium A planetarium (plural planetaria or planetariums) is a theatre built primarily for presenting educational and entertaining shows about astronomy and the night sky, or for training in celestial navigation.    A dominant feature of most planetaria is the large dome-shaped projection screen onto which scenes of stars, planets and other celestial objects can be made to appear and move realistically to simulate the complex 'motions of the heavens'.   The celestial scenes can be created using a wide variety of technologies, for example precision-engineered 'star balls' that combine optical and electro-mechanical technology, slide projector, video and fulldome projector systems, and lasers. 

Orrery<====>60549<====>Orrery An orrery is a mechanical model of the solar system that illustrates or predicts the relative positions and motions of the planets and moons, usually according to the heliocentric model.  It may also represent the relative sizes of these bodies; but since accurate scaling is often not practical due to the actual large ratio differences, a subdued approximation may be used instead.  Though the Greeks had working planetaria, the first orrery that was a planetarium of the modern era was produced in 1704, and one was presented to Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery – whence came the name.

Tetrapods evolved from a group of animals known as the Tetrapodomorpha, who in turn evolved from ancient Sarcopterygii lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian period;  their forms were transitional between lobe-finned fishes and the four-limbed tetrapods. The first tetrapods appeared by the late Devonian, 367. 

Redlining<====>60562<====>Redlining In the United States, redlining is the practice of denying services, either directly or through selectively raising prices, to residents of certain areas based on the racial or ethnic composition of those areas.  While the best known examples of redlining have involved denial of financial services such as banking or insurance,  other services such as health care  or even supermarkets  have been denied to residents (or in the case of retail businesses like supermarkets, simply located impractically far away from said residents) to result in a redlining effect.

Rectifier<====>60569<====>Rectifier A rectifier is an electrical device that converts alternating current (AC), which periodically reverses direction, to direct current (DC), which flows in only one direction.  The process is known as rectification, since it "straightens" the direction of current.  Physically, rectifiers take a number of forms, including vacuum tube diodes, mercury-arc valves, stacks of copper and selenium oxide plates, semiconductor diodes, silicon-controlled rectifiers and other silicon-based semiconductor switches.  Historically, even synchronous electromechanical switches and motors have been used.  Early radio receivers, called crystal radios, used a "cat's whisker" of fine wire pressing on a crystal of galena (lead sulfide) to serve as a point-contact rectifier or "crystal detector".

Bluegrass music<====>60590<====>Bluegrass music  Bluegrass music is a form of American roots music, and a related genre of country music.  Influenced by the music of Appalachia,  bluegrass has mixed roots in Irish, Scottish and English  traditional music, and was also later influenced by the music of African-Americans  through incorporation of jazz elements. Settlers from Britain and Ireland arrived in Appalachia during the 18th century, and brought with them the musical traditions of their homelands.   These traditions consisted primarily of English and Scottish ballads—which were essentially unaccompanied narrative—and dance music, such as Irish reels, which were accompanied by a fiddle. 

Datasaab<====>60592<====>DatasaabFor the 11th century Persian Sufi scholar Daata Sab, see Ali Hujwiri.  Datasaab was the computer division of, and later a separate company spun off from, aircraft manufacturer Saab in Linköping, Sweden.

Barcode<====>60600<====>Barcode  A barcode is an optical, machine-readable, representation of data; the data usually describes something about the object that carries the barcode.  Originally barcodes systematically represented data by varying the widths and spacings of parallel lines, and may be referred to as linear or one-dimensional (1D).  Later two-dimensional (2D) codes were developed, using rectangles, dots, hexagons and other geometric patterns in two dimensions, usually called barcodes although they do not use bars as such.  Barcodes were initially scanned by special optical scanners called barcode readers.  Later application software became available for devices that could read images, such as smartphones with cameras.

Glucose tolerance test<====>60635<====>Glucose tolerance testThe glucose tolerance test is a  medical test in which glucose is given and  blood samples taken afterward to determine how quickly it is cleared from the blood.   The test is usually used to test for diabetes, insulin resistance, impaired beta cell function,    and sometimes reactive hypoglycemia and acromegaly, or rarer disorders of carbohydrate metabolism.  In the most commonly performed version of the test, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), a standard dose of glucose is ingested by mouth and blood levels are checked two hours later.Many variations of the GTT have been devised over the years for various purposes, with different standard doses of glucose, different routes of administration, different intervals and durations of sampling, and various substances measured in addition to blood glucose.

Prime element<====>60692<====>Prime elementIn mathematics, specifically in abstract algebra, a prime element of a commutative ring is an object satisfying certain properties similar to the prime numbers in the integers and to irreducible polynomials.  Care should be taken to distinguish prime elements from irreducible elements, a concept which is the same in UFDs but not the same in general. DefinitionAn element   of a commutative ring   is said to be prime if it is not zero or a unit and whenever   divides   for some   and   in  , then   divides   or   divides  . 

Irreducible element<====>60693<====>Irreducible elementIn abstract algebra, a non-zero non-unit element in an integral domain is said to be irreducible if it is not a product of two non-units.  Relationship with prime elementsIrreducible elements should not be confused with prime elements.  (A non-zero non-unit element  a  in a commutative ring  R  is called prime if, whenever  a | bc  for some  b  and  c  in  R,  then  a|b  or  a|c. )  In an integral domain, every prime element is irreducible,  Sharpe (1987) p. 54  but the converse is not true in general. 

Excavation (archaeology)<====>60697<====>Excavation (archaeology)   In archaeology, excavation is the exposure, processing and recording of archaeological remains.

Numerous specialized techniques each with its particular features are used.  Resources and other practical issues do not allow archaeologists to carry out excavations whenever and wherever they choose.  These constraints mean many known sites have been deliberately left unexcavated.

The rapid growth of organometallic chemistry is often attributed to the excitement arising from the discovery of ferrocene and its many analogues. HistoryFerrocene was first prepared unintentionally.  In 1951, Pauson and Kealy at Duquesne University reported the reaction of cyclopentadienyl magnesium bromide and ferric chloride with the goal of oxidatively coupling the diene to prepare fulvalene.

Cyclopentadiene<====>60721<====>Cyclopentadiene Cyclopentadiene is an organic compound with the formula C 5 H 6 .   This colorless liquid has a strong and unpleasant odor.   At room temperature, this cyclic diene dimerizes over the course of hours to give dicyclopentadiene via a Diels–Alder reaction.  This dimer can be restored by heating to give the monomer. The compound is mainly used for the production of cyclopentene and its derivatives.   It is popularly used as a precursor to the cyclopentadienyl ligand (Cp) in cyclopentadienyl complexes in organometallic chemistry.  Production and reactionsCyclopentadiene production is usually not distinguished from dicyclopentadiene since they are interconverted. 

Simputer<====>60726<====>Simputer The Simputer is a self-contained, open hardware Linux-based handheld computer, first released in 2002.  Developed in, and primarily distributed within India, the product was envisioned as a low-cost alternative to personal computers.  With initial goals of selling 50,000 simputers, the project had sold only about 4,000 units by 2005, and has been called a failure by news sources.   Design and HardwareThe device was designed by the Simputer Trust, a non-profit organization formed in November 1999 by seven Indian scientists and engineers led by Dr.  Swami Manohar.  The word "Simputer" is an acronym for "simple, inexpensive and multilingual people's computer", and is a trademark of the Simputer Trust. 

Mebibyte<====>60727<====>Mebibyte The mebibyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information.   The binary prefix mebi means 2 20 , therefore one mebibyte is equal to   = 1024 kibibytes.  The unit symbol for the mebibyte is MiB.   Technically a megabyte (MB) is a power of ten, while a mebibyte (MiB) is a power of two, appropriate for binary machines. The unit was established by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in 1998.   It was designed to replace the megabyte when used in the binary sense to mean 2 20  bytes, which conflicts with the definition of the prefix mega in the International System of Units (SI) as a multiplier of 10 6 . 

Lucy Maud Montgomery<====>60730<====>Lucy Maud Montgomery Lucy Maud Montgomery,   (November 30, 1874 – April 24, 1942), published as L. M.  Montgomery, was a Canadian author best known for a series of novels beginning in 1908 with Anne of Green Gables.  The book was an immediate success.  The central character, Anne Shirley, an orphaned girl, made Montgomery famous in her lifetime and gave her an international following.  The first novel was followed by a series of sequels with Anne as the central character.  Montgomery went on to publish 20 novels as well as 530 short stories, 500 poems, and 30 essays. 

Anachronism<====>60731<====>Anachronism An anachronism (from the Greek  , "against" and  , "time") is a chronological inconsistency in some arrangement, especially a juxtaposition of persons, events, objects, or customs from different periods of time.  The most common type of anachronism is an object misplaced in time, but it may be a verbal expression, a technology, a philosophical idea, a musical style, a material, a plant or animal, a custom or anything else associated with a particular period in time so that it is incorrect to place it outside its proper temporal domain. An anachronism may be either intentional or unintentional. 

Hetman<====>60733<====>Hetman  Hetman is a political title from Central and Eastern Europe, historically assigned to military commanders.  It was the title of the second-highest military commander in the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the 16th to 18th centuries.  For much of the history of Romania and the Principality of Moldavia, the Hetman (Romanian: hatman) was the second in rank in the army after the ruling prince (who held the position of Voivode).  In Ukraine, a Hetman was also the highest military officer in Ukraine's Hetmanates, the Zaporizhian Host (1649–1764) and the Ukrainian State (1918). 

Bond (finance)<====>60737<====>Bond (finance)  In finance, a bond is an instrument of indebtedness of the bond issuer to the holders.  The most common types of bonds include municipal bonds and corporate bonds. The bond is a debt security, under which the issuer owes the holders a debt and (depending on the terms of the bond) is obliged to pay them interest (the coupon) or to repay the principal at a later date, termed the maturity date.   Interest is usually payable at fixed intervals (semiannual, annual, sometimes monthly).  Very often the bond is negotiable, that is, the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. 

Piast dynasty<====>60738<====>Piast dynasty   The Piast dynasty was the first historical ruling dynasty of Poland.  The first documented Polish monarch was Prince Mieszko I (c.  930–992).  The Piasts' royal rule in Poland ended in 1370 with the death of king Casimir III the Great. Branches of the Piast dynasty continued to rule in the Duchy of Masovia and in the Duchies of Silesia until the last male Silesian Piast died in 1675.  The Piasts intermarried with several noble lines of Europe, and possessed numerous titles, some within the Holy Roman Empire. Origin of the nameThe early dukes and kings of Poland are said to have regarded themselves as descendants of the semi-legendary  Piast the Wheelwright (Piast Kołodziej), first mentioned in the Cronicae et gesta ducum sive principum Polonorum (Chronicles and deeds of the dukes or princes of the Poles), written c. 

Poitou<====>60739<====>Poitou  {{Infobox settlement   }}Poitou ( ), in Poitevin: Poetou, was a province of west-central France whose capital city was Poitiers. GeographyThe main historical cities are Poitiers (historical capital city), Châtellerault (France's kings establishment in Poitou), Niort, La Roche-sur-Yon, Thouars, and Parthenay. HistoryThe region of Poitou was called Thifalia (or Theiphalia) in the sixth century. There is a marshland called the Poitevin Marsh (French Marais Poitevin) on the Gulf of Poitou, on the west coast of France, just north of La Rochelle and west of Niort. By the Treaty of Paris of 1259, King Henry III of England recognized his loss of continental Plantaganet territory to France (including Normandy, Maine, Anjou, and Poitou). 

Judith of Swabia<====>60741<====>Judith of Swabia Judith of Swabia ( ,  ; Summer 1054 – 14 March ca.  1105?), a member of the Salian dynasty, was the youngest daughter of Emperor Henry III from his second marriage with Agnes of Poitou.  By her two marriages she was Queen of Hungary from 1063 to 1074 and Duchess of Poland from 1089 to 1102. LifeBorn probably at the Imperial Palace of Goslar, Judith (also named Judith Maria or Judith Sophia in some sources) was the youngest of the six children born to Emperor Henry III and Empress Agnes, a daughter of the French duke William V of Aquitaine. 

Cubic zirconia<====>60744<====>Cubic zirconia    Cubic zirconia (CZ) is the cubic crystalline form of zirconium dioxide (ZrO 2 ).  The synthesized material is hard, optically flawless and usually colorless, but may be made in a variety of different colors.  It should not be confused with zircon, which is a zirconium silicate (ZrSiO 4 ).  It is sometimes erroneously called "cubic zirconium". Because of its low cost, durability, and close visual likeness to diamond, synthetic cubic zirconia has remained the most gemologically and economically important competitor for diamonds since commercial production began in 1976.  Its main competitor as a synthetic gemstone is a more recently cultivated material, synthetic moissanite. 

Władysław I Herman<====>60749<====>Władysław I Herman  Władysław I Herman (  1044  – 4 June 1102) was a Duke of Poland from 1079 until his death. He was the second son of Casimir I the Restorer by his wife Maria Dobroniega, daughter of Vladimir the Great, Grand Duke of Kiev. BiographyAs the second son, Władysław was not destined for the throne.  However, due to the flight from Poland of his older brother Bolesław II the Bold in 1079, he was elevated to the rank of Duke of Poland.  Opinions vary on whether Władysław played an active role in the plot to depose his brother or whether he was handed the authority simply because he was the most proper person, being the next in line in the absence of the king and his son Mieszko Bolesławowic. 

Bolesław III Wrymouth<====>60750<====>Bolesław III Wrymouth  Bolesław III Wrymouth (also known as Boleslaus III the Wry-mouthed,  ) (20 August 1086   – 28 October 1138), was a Duke of Lesser Poland, Silesia and Sandomierz between 1102 and 1107 and over the whole Poland between 1107 and 1138.  He was the only child of Prince Władysław I Herman and his first wife Judith, daughter of Vratislaus II of Bohemia. Bolesław began to rule in the last decade of the 11th century, when the central government in Poland was significantly weakened.  Władysław I Herman fell under the political dependence of the Count palatine Sieciech, who became the real ruler of the country. 

222 BC<====>60751<====>222 BC   Year 222 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Marcellus and Calvus (or, less frequently, year 532 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 222 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. Events By placeRoman RepublicMediolanum (modern Milan), stronghold of the Gallic tribe of the Insubres (led by Viridomarus), falls to Roman legions in Lombardy (led by consul, Marcus Claudius Marcellus), in the Battle of Clastidium. 

Casimir I the Restorer<====>60757<====>Casimir I the Restorer Casimir I the Restorer ( ; b.  Kraków, 25 July 1016 – d.  Poznań, 28 November 1058), was Duke of Poland of the Piast dynasty and the de jure monarch of the entire country from 1034 until his death. He was the only son of Mieszko II Lambert by his wife Richeza, daughter of Count Palatine Ezzo of Lotharingia (of the Ezzonids) and granddaughter of Emperor Otto II. Casimir is known as the Restorer because he managed to reunite all parts of the Polish Kingdom after a period of turmoil.  He reinstated Masovia, Silesia and Pomerania into his realm. 

Box–Muller transform<====>60758<====>Box–Muller transformThe Box–Muller transform, by George Edward Pelham Box and Mervin Edgar Muller,  is a pseudo-random number sampling method for generating pairs of independent, standard, normally distributed (zero expectation, unit variance) random numbers, given a source of uniformly distributed random numbers.  The method was in fact first mentioned by Raymond E.  A.  C.  Paley and Norbert Wiener in 1934,  and it is more likely than not that this source was well known to Box and Muller, which, however, failed to mention it in their article of 1958. The Box–Muller transform is commonly expressed in two forms. 

Pashtunistan<====>60759<====>Pashtunistan{{Infobox settlement }}Pashtūnistān ( ; also transliterated Pakhtūnistān; lit.  "homeland of the Pashtuns")  is the geographic region inhabited by the indigenous Pashtun people of modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan, wherein Pashtun culture, language, and national identity have been based. Alternative names historically used for the region include "Pashtūnkhwā" and "Afghānistān", since at least the 3rd century CE onward. Pashtunistan borders Punjab to the east, Persian and Turkic speaking regions to the west and north, Kashmir to the northeast, and Balochistan to the south. 

Reginald Bretnor<====>60760<====>Reginald Bretnor Reginald Bretnor (born Alfred Reginald Kahn; July 30, 1911 – July 22, 1992)  was a science fiction author who flourished between the 1950s and 1980s.  Most of his fiction was in short story form, and usually featured a whimsical story line or ironic plot twist.  He also wrote on military theory and public affairs, and edited some of the earliest books to consider SF from a literary theory and criticism perspective. Bretnor’s father, Grigory Kahn, was born in Russia, but he and his family left Siberia for Japan in 1917 and later settled in the United States. 

Genius of the Species<====>60763<====>Genius of the Species "Genius of the Species" is a short story by Reginald Bretnor (first published with the author name "R.  Bretnor"), which originally appeared in the anthology 9 Tales of Space and Time edited by Raymond Healy. The story is set in the Soviet Union where a rat problem is getting out of control due to the laziness of cats.  This problem is solved by a government program to use artificial means to raise the intelligence of cats to an IQ of 20. 2 so that they can be taught Marxism and subsequently realize catching rats is for the greater good. 

Pseudosphere<====>60766<====>PseudosphereIn geometry, the term pseudosphere is used to describe various surfaces with constant negative Gaussian curvature.  Depending on context, it can refer to either a theoretical surface of constant negative curvature, a tractricoid, or a hyperboloid. Theoretical pseudosphereIn its general interpretation, a pseudosphere of radius   is any surface of curvature  , by analogy with the sphere of radius  , which is a surface of curvature  .  The term was introduced by Eugenio Beltrami in his 1868 paper on models of hyperbolic geometry.    (Also  ;  ) TractricoidThe term is also used to refer to a certain surface called the tractricoid: the result of revolving a tractrix about its asymptote. 

Gemology<====>60767<====>Gemology Gemology or gemmology is the science dealing with natural and artificial gemstone materials.  It is considered a geoscience and a branch of mineralogy.  Some jewelers are academically trained gemologists and are qualified to identify and evaluate gems.BackgroundRudimentary education in gemology for jewelers and gemologists began in the nineteenth century, but the first qualifications were instigated after the National Association of Goldsmiths of Great Britain (NAG) set up a Gemmological Committee for this purpose in 1908.  This committee matured into the Gemmological Association of Great Britain (also known as Gem-A), now an educational charity and accredited awarding body with its courses taught worldwide. 

Curvature<====>60770<====>Curvature In mathematics, curvature is any of a number of loosely related concepts in different areas of geometry.  Intuitively, curvature is the amount by which a geometric object such as a surface deviates from being a flat plane, or a curve from being straight as in the case of a line, but this is defined in different ways depending on the context.  There is a key distinction between extrinsic curvature, which is defined for objects embedded in another space (usually a Euclidean space) – in a way that relates to the radius of curvature of circles that touch the object – and intrinsic curvature, which is defined in terms of the lengths of curves within a Riemannian manifold.

ACID<====>60776<====>ACID In computer science, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures, etc.  In the context of databases, a sequence of database operations that satisfies the ACID properties, and thus can be perceived as a single logical operation on the data, is called a transaction.  For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction. In 1983,  Andreas Reuter and Theo Härder coined the acronym ACID as shorthand for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, building on earlier work  by Jim Gray who enumerated Atomicity, Consistency, and Durability but left out Isolation when characterizing the transaction concept. 

Limonite<====>60777<====>Limonite Limonite is an iron ore consisting of a mixture of hydrated iron(III) oxide-hydroxides in varying composition.  The generic formula is frequently written as FeO(OH)·nH 2 O, although this is not entirely accurate as the ratio of oxide to hydroxide can vary quite widely.  Limonite is one of the two principal iron ores, the other being hematite, and has been mined for the production of iron since at least 2500 BCE.   NamesLimonite is named from the Greek word for meadow (λειμών), in allusion to its occurrence as bog iron ore in meadows and marshes (reference is here needed, since one may rather see it originating in the Latin "limus" - which means mud - or in its yellowish lemon-like color).

Lepton<====>60828<====>Lepton    A lepton is an elementary, half-integer spin (spin  ) particle that does not undergo strong interactions.Two main classes of leptons exist: charged leptons (also known as the electron-like leptons), and neutral leptons (better known as neutrinos).  Charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various composite particles such as atoms and positronium, while neutrinos rarely interact with anything, and are consequently rarely observed.   The best known of all leptons is the electron. There are six types of leptons, known as flavours, forming three generations. The first generation is the electronic leptons, comprising the electron ( ) and electron neutrino ( ); the second is the muonic leptons, comprising the muon ( ) and muon neutrino ( ); and the third is the tauonic leptons, comprising the tau ( ) and the tau neutrino ( ).

Bible story<====>60843<====>Bible story Bible stories, Judeo-Christian retellings of certain portions of the Bible, have long had a place in family religious worship, spiritual instruction, literature, and the cultural underpinnings of many Christian and Jewish societies.  In many Christian churches, they are regular ingredients of Sunday School curricula.  The underlying spiritual principles in many of these stories are also used in preaching and teaching for Judeo-Christian adults as well.  The Tanakh, also known as the Old Testament, contains stories about the creation and fall of humanity, the covenant God established with Abraham, and the history of the 'Chosen People' of Israel. 

Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell<====>60845<====>Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell    Lieutenant-General Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell,    (   ; 22 February 1857 – 8 January 1941) was a British Army officer, writer, author of Scouting for Boys which was an inspiration for the Scout Movement, founder and first Chief Scout of The Boy Scouts Association and founder of the Girl Guides. After having been educated at Charterhouse School in Surrey, Baden-Powell served in the British Army from 1876 until 1910 in India and Africa.  In 1899, during the Second Boer War in South Africa, Baden-Powell successfully defended the town in the Siege of Mafeking. 

Land of Goshen<====>60847<====>Land of Goshen   The Land of Goshen (  or   Eretz Gošen) is named in the Bible as the place in Egypt given to the Hebrews by the pharaoh of Joseph ( ), and the land from which they later left Egypt at the time of the Exodus.  It was located in the eastern Delta of the Nile. Meaning of the nameIf the Septuagint reading "Gesem" is correct, the word, which in its Hebrew form has no known meaning, may mean "cultivated"—comparing the Arabic root j-š-m, "to labor. " Egyptologists have suggested a connection with the Egyptian word qas, meaning "inundated land" because Goshen was apparently the same region, called by the Greeks the "Arabian nome," which had its capital at Phakousa representing the Egyptian Pa-qas (Brugsch, Geog. 

Additive category<====>60854<====>Additive category In mathematics, specifically in category theory, an additive category is a preadditive category C admitting all finitary biproducts. DefinitionA category C is preadditive if all its hom-sets are abelian groups and composition of morphisms is bilinear; in other words, C is enriched over the monoidal category of abelian groups. In a preadditive category, every finitary product (including the empty product, i. e. , a final object) is necessarily a coproduct (or initial object in the case of an empty diagram), and hence a biproduct, and conversely every finitary coproduct is necessarily a product (this is a consequence of the definition, not a part of it).

Luminescence<====>60871<====>Luminescence Luminescence is emission of light by a substance not resulting from heat; it is thus a form of cold-body radiation.  It can be caused by chemical reactions, electrical energy, subatomic motions or stress on a crystal, which all are ultimately caused by Spontaneous emission.  This distinguishes luminescence from incandescence, which is light emitted by a substance as a result of heating.  Historically, radioactivity was thought of as a form of "radio-luminescence", although it is today considered to be separate since it involves more than electromagnetic radiation.   The dials, hands, scales, and signs of aviation and navigational instruments and markings are often coated with luminescent materials in a process known as "luminising". 

Fairfield, Ohio<====>60872<====>Fairfield, Ohio   Fairfield is a city in Butler and Hamilton counties in the U. S.  state of Ohio, and a residential suburb of nearby Cincinnati.  Fairfield was incorporated in 1955.   The population was 42,510 at the 2010 census.   It includes the former hamlet of Symmes Corner, named after Celadon Symmes.   The city school district is one of the largest in Ohio, with Fairfield High School graduating 842 students in June 2009.

Photoluminescence<====>60874<====>PhotoluminescencePhotoluminescence (abbreviated as PL) is light emission from any form of matter after the absorption of photons (electromagnetic radiation).  It is one of many forms of luminescence (light emission) and is initiated by photoexcitation (excitation by photons), hence the prefix photo-.   Following excitation various relaxation processes typically occur in which other photons are re-radiated.  Time periods between absorption and emission may vary: ranging from short femtosecond-regime for emission involving free-carrier plasma in inorganic semiconductors Hayes, G. R. ; Deveaud, B.  (2002).  "Is Luminescence from Quantum Wells Due to Excitons?".  physica status solidi (a) 190 (3): 637–640. 

Triboluminescence<====>60875<====>TriboluminescenceTriboluminescence is an optical phenomenon in which light is generated through the breaking of chemical bonds in a material when it is pulled apart, ripped, scratched, crushed, or rubbed (see tribology).  The phenomenon is not fully understood, but appears to be caused by the separation and reunification of electrical charges.   The term comes from the Greek   ("to rub"; see tribology) and the Latin lumen (light).   Triboluminescence can be observed when breaking sugar crystals and peeling adhesive tapes. Triboluminescence is often used as a synonym for fractoluminescence (a term sometimes used when referring only to light emitted from fractured crystals). 

Markov chain<====>60876<====>Markov chain A Markov chain is "a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. " In probability theory and related fields, a Markov process, named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov, is a stochastic process that satisfies the Markov property (sometimes characterized as "memorylessness").  Roughly speaking, a process satisfies the Markov property if one can make predictions for the future of the process based solely on its present state just as well as one could knowing the process's full history, hence independently from such history; i. 

Diamond cutting<====>60877<====>Diamond cutting Diamond cutting is the practice of changing a diamond from a rough stone into a faceted gem.  Cutting diamond requires specialized knowledge, tools, equipment, and techniques because of its extreme difficulty. The first guild of diamond cutters and polishers (diamantaire) was formed in 1375 in Nuremberg, Germany , and led to the development of various types of "cut".  This has two meanings in relation to diamonds.  The first is the shape: square, oval, and so on.  The second relates to the specific quality of cut within the shape, and the quality and price will vary greatly based on the cut quality. 

The Lion in Winter<====>60878<====>The Lion in Winter   The Lion in Winter is a 1966 play by James Goldman, depicting the personal and political conflicts of Henry II of England, his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine, their children and their guests during Christmas, 1183.  It premiered on Broadway at the Ambassador Theatre on March 3, 1966, starring Robert Preston and Rosemary Harris, who won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Eleanor.  It was adapted by Goldman into an Academy Award-winning 1968 film of the same name, starring Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn.  The play has been produced numerous times, including Broadway and West End revivals. 

Electroluminescence<====>60879<====>Electroluminescence Electroluminescence (EL) is an optical phenomenon and electrical phenomenon in which a material emits light in response to the passage of an electric current or to a strong electric field.  This is distinct from black body light emission resulting from heat (incandescence), from a chemical reaction (chemiluminescence), sound (sonoluminescence), or other mechanical action (mechanoluminescence). MechanismElectroluminescence is the result of radiative recombination of electrons and holes in a material, usually a semiconductor.  The excited electrons release their energy as photons - light.  Prior to recombination, electrons and holes may be separated either by doping the material to form a p-n junction (in semiconductor electroluminescent devices such as light-emitting diodes) or through excitation by impact of high-energy electrons accelerated by a strong electric field (as with the phosphors in electroluminescent displays). 

Electrical phenomena<====>60880<====>Electrical phenomenaElectrical phenomena are commonplace and unusual events that can be observed and that illuminate the principles of the physics of electricity and are explained by them. Electrical phenomena are a somewhat arbitrary division ofelectromagnetic phenomena. Some examples areBiefeld–Brown effect — Thought by the person who coined the name, Thomas Townsend Brown, to be an anti-gravity effect, it is generally attributed to electrohydrodynamics (EHD) or sometimes electro-fluid-dynamics, a counterpart to the well-known magneto-hydrodynamics. Contact electrification — The phenomenon of electrification by contact.  When two objects were touched together, sometimes the objects became spontaneously charged (οne negative charge, one positive charge). 

Watch<====>60883<====>Watch   A watch is a timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person.  It is designed to keep working despite the motions caused by the person's activities.  A wristwatch is designed to be worn around the wrist, attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet.  A pocket watch is designed for a person to carry in a pocket. Watches progressed in the 17th century from spring-powered clocks, which appeared as early as the 14th century.   During most of its history the watch was a mechanical device, driven by clockwork, powered by winding a mainspring, and keeping time with an oscillating balance wheel. 

Photoconductivity<====>60885<====>Photoconductivity Photoconductivity is an optical and electrical phenomenon in which a material becomes more electrically conductive due to the absorption of electromagnetic radiation such as visible light, ultraviolet light, infrared light, or gamma radiation.    When light is absorbed by a material such as a semiconductor, the number of free electrons and electron holes increases and raises its electrical conductivity.   To cause excitation, the light that strikes the semiconductor must have enough energy to raise electrons across the band gap, or to excite the impurities within the band gap.  When a bias voltage and a load resistor are used in series with the semiconductor, a voltage drop across the load resistors can be measured when the change in electrical conductivity of the material varies the current through the circuit. 

Lev Yashin<====>60886<====>Lev Yashin   Lev Ivanovich Yashin ( , 22 October 1929 – 20 March 1990), nicknamed  the "Black Spider" or the "Black Panther", was a Russian football goalkeeper, considered by many in the sport to be the greatest goalkeeper in the history of the game.He was known for his athleticism, positioning, stature, bravery, imposing presence in goal, and acrobatic reflex saves.    FIFA.  Retrieved 23 November 2013 He was also deputy chairman of the Football Federation of the Soviet Union. Yashin earned iconic status for revolutionizing the goalkeeping position by stamping his authority on the entire defense. 

Skull crucible<====>60889<====>Skull crucible The skull crucible process was developed at the Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow to manufacture cubic zirconia.  It was invented to solve the problem of cubic zirconia's melting-point being too high for even platinum crucibles.  In essence, by heating only the center of a volume of cubic zirconia, the material forms its own "crucible" from its cooler outer layers.  The term "skull" refers to these outer layers forming a shell enclosing the molten volume.  Zirconium oxide powder is heated then gradually allowed to cool.  Heating is accomplished by radio frequency induction using a coil wrapped around the apparatus. 

Surveying<====>60891<====>Surveying   Surveying or land surveying is the technique, profession, and science of determining the terrestrial or three-dimensional positions of points and the distances and angles between them.  A land surveying professional is called a land surveyor.  These points are usually on the surface of the Earth, and they are often used to establish maps and boundaries for ownership, locations, such as building corners or the surface location of subsurface features, or other purposes required by government or civil law, such as property sales. Surveyors work with elements of geometry, trigonometry, regression analysis, physics, engineering, metrology, programming languages, and the law. 

Land of Hope and Glory<====>60895<====>Land of Hope and Glory    "Land of Hope and Glory" is a British patriotic song, with music by Edward Elgar and lyrics by A.  C.  Benson, written in 1902. CompositionThe music to which the words of the refrain "Land of Hope and Glory, &c"  below are set is the "trio" theme from Edward Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance March No.  1.The words were fitted to the melody on the suggestion of King Edward VII who told Elgar he thought the melody would make a great song.  When Elgar was requested to write a work for the King's coronation, he worked the suggestion into his Coronation Ode, for which he asked the poet and essayist A. 

Greasy spoon<====>60899<====>Greasy spoonGreasy spoon is a colloquial term for a small, cheap restaurant or diner typically specializing in fried foods.   According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term originated in the United States  and is now used in various English-speaking countries.  Originally disparaging, the term is now more frequently used in an endearing sense. EtymologyThe name "greasy spoon" is a reference both to the typically high-fat/oil, and high-calorie menu items at such places, for example: bacon and eggs, hamburgers, chili etc. , and to the supposed general standard of cleanliness.  The term has been used to refer to a "small cheap restaurant" since at least the 1920s. 

Carp<====>60900<====>Carp Carp are various species of oily  freshwater fish from the family Cyprinidae, a very large group of fish native to Europe and Asia. BiologyThe cypriniformes (family Cyprinidae) are traditionally grouped with the Characiformes, Siluriformes, and Gymnotiformes to create the superorder Ostariophysi, since these groups share some common features.  These features include being found predominantly in fresh water and possessing Weberian ossicles, an anatomical structure derived from the first five anterior-most vertebrae, and their corresponding ribs and neural crests.  The third anterior-most pair of ribs is in contact with the extension of the labyrinth and the posterior with the swim bladder. 

Pomp and Circumstance Marches<====>60901<====>Pomp and Circumstance Marches   The Pomp and Circumstance Marches (full title Pomp and Circumstance Military Marches), Op.  39, are a series of marches for orchestra composed by Sir Edward Elgar.   They include some of Elgar's best-known compositions.  TitleThe title is taken from Act III, Scene 3 of Shakespeare's Othello:  Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,The spirit-stirring drum, th'ear-piercing fife,The royal banner, and all quality,Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!   But also, on the score of the first march, Elgar set as a motto for the whole set of marches a verse from Lord de Tabley's poem "The March of Glory", Maine: Works pp. 

FAT filesystem and Linux<====>60902<====>FAT filesystem and LinuxLinux has several filesystem drivers for the File Allocation Table (FAT) filesystem format.   These are commonly known by the names used in the  mount  command to invoke particular drivers in the kernel: msdos, vfat, and umsdos.  Differences, advantages, and disadvantagesAll of the Linux filesystem drivers support all three FAT types, namely FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32.   Where they differ is in the provision of support for long filenames, beyond the 8. 3 filename structure of the original FAT filesystem format, and in the provision of Unix file semantics that do not exist as standard in the FAT filesystem format such as file permissions.

Stigmergy<====>60913<====>StigmergyStigmergy is a consensus social network mechanism of indirect coordination, through the environment, between agents or actions.The principle is that the trace left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a next action, by the same or a different agent.  In that way, subsequent actions tend to reinforce and build on each other, leading to the spontaneous emergence of coherent, apparently systematic activity.  Stigmergy is a form of self-organization social network.  It produces complex, seemingly intelligent structures, without need for any planning, control, or even direct communication between the agents. 

M. A. R. Barker<====>60915<====>M.  A.  R.  Barker Muhammad Abd-al-Rahman Barker (born Phillip Barker, November 3, 1929 – March 16, 2012),  was a professor of Urdu and South Asian Studies who created one of the first roleplaying games, Empire of the Petal Throne, and wrote several fantasy/science fantasy novels based in his associated world setting of Tékumel. Early lifeBorn in Spokane, Washington, descended from ancestors who had originally settled in America in 1626, Barker's childhood was spent around Washington and Idaho.   As a youth he had an interest in "fairy stories, history and literature" which would be further influenced by such films as The Thief of Bagdad; all of which helped to turn his casual "wargames" with toy soldiers more towards fantasy. 

Lola Ridge<====>60917<====>Lola Ridge   Lola Ridge, born Rose Emily Ridge (12 December 1873 Dublin – 19 May 1941 Brooklyn) was an Irish-American anarchist poet and an influential editor of avant-garde, feminist, and Marxist publications.

Tetrahydrocannabinol<====>60920<====>Tetrahydrocannabinol  Tetrahydrocannabinol, abbreviated THC, is one of at least 113 cannabinoids identified in cannabis.  Dronabinol – trade names Marinol or Syndros – is a synthetic form of THC approved by the FDA as an appetite stimulant for people with AIDS and antiemetic for people receiving chemotherapy.THC is the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis.  With chemical name, (−)-trans-Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol, the term THC also refers to cannabinoid isomers.  The pharmaceutical formulation dronabinol is an oily resin provided in capsules available by prescription in the US, Canada, Germany, and New Zealand. Like most pharmacologically-active secondary metabolites of plants, THC is a lipid found in cannabis,  assumed to be involved in the plant's self-defense, putatively against insect predation, ultraviolet light, and environmental stress. 

Battle of the Somme<====>60921<====>Battle of the Somme The Battle of the Somme ( ,  ), also known as the Somme Offensive, was a battle of the First World War fought by the armies of the British and French empires against the German Empire.  It took place between 1 July and 18 November 1916 on both sides of the upper reaches of the River Somme in France.  The battle was intended to hasten a victory for the Allies and was the largest battle of the First World War on the Western Front.   More than three million men fought in this battle and one million men were wounded or killed, making it one of the bloodiest battles in human history. 

Ship commissioning<====>60925<====>Ship commissioning Ship commissioning is the act or ceremony of placing a ship in active service, and may be regarded as a particular application of the general concepts and practices of project commissioning.  The term is most commonly applied to the placing of a warship in active duty with its country's military forces.  The ceremonies involved are often rooted in centuries old naval tradition. Ship naming and launching endow a ship hull with her identity, but many milestones remain before she is completed and considered ready to be designated a commissioned ship.  The engineering plant, weapon and electronic systems, galley, and multitudinous other equipment required to transform the new hull into an operating and habitable warship are installed and tested. 

Ceremonial ship launching<====>60930<====>Ceremonial ship launching Ceremonial ship launching is the process of transferring a vessel to the water.  It is a naval tradition in many cultures, dating back thousands of years.  It has been observed as a public celebration and a solemn blessing. Ship launching imposes stresses on the ship not met during normal operation, in addition to the size and weight of the vessel, and it represents a considerable engineering challenge as well as a public spectacle.  The process also involves many traditions intended to invite good luck, such as christening by breaking a sacrificial bottle of champagne over the bow as the ship is named aloud and launched. 

Phenomenon<====>60931<====>Phenomenon   A phenomenon (Greek: φαινόμενον, phainómenon, from the verb phainein, to show, shine, appear, to be manifest or manifest itself, plural phenomena)    is any thing which manifests itself.  Phenomena are often, but not always, understood as "things that appear" or "experiences" for a sentient being, or in principle may be so. The term came into its modern philosophical usage through Immanuel Kant, who contrasted it with the noumenon.  In contrast to a phenomenon, a noumenon can not be directly observed.  Kant was heavily influenced by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in this part of his philosophy, in which phenomenon and noumenon serve as interrelated technical terms. 

Sudarium of Oviedo<====>60932<====>Sudarium of OviedoThe Sudarium of Oviedo, or Shroud of Oviedo, is a bloodstained piece of cloth measuring c.  84 x 53 cm (33 x 21 inches) kept in the Cámara Santa of the Cathedral of San Salvador, Oviedo, Spain.The Sudarium (Latin for sweat cloth) is thought to be the cloth that was wrapped around the head of Jesus Christ after he died as described in  The cloth has been dated to around 700 AD by radiocarbon dating.  However, at the same conference at which this information was presented, it was noted that in actuality the cloth has a definite history extending back to approximately 570 AD. 

Triboelectric effect<====>60933<====>Triboelectric effect The triboelectric effect (also known as  triboelectric charging) is a type of contact electrification on which certain materials become electrically charged after they come into frictional contact with a different material.   Rubbing glass with fur, or a plastic comb through the hair, can build up triboelectricity.  Most everyday static electricity is triboelectric.  The polarity and strength of the charges produced differ according to the materials, surface roughness, temperature, strain, and other properties. The triboelectric effect is not very predictable, and only broad generalizations can be made.  Amber, for example, can acquire an electric charge by contact and separation (or friction) with a material like wool. 

395 BC<====>60934<====>395 BC    Year 395 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time, it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Cossus, Medullinus, Scipio, Fidenas, Ambustus and Lactucinus (or, less frequently, year 359 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 395 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

Pleochroism<====>60943<====>Pleochroism  Pleochroism is an optical phenomenon in which a substance has different colors when observed at different angles, especially with polarized light.   .  BackgroundAnisotropic crystals will have optical properties that vary with the direction of light.  The direction of the electric field determines the polarization of light, and crystals will respond in different ways if this angle is changed.  These kinds of crystals have one or two optical axes.  If absorption of light varies with the angle relative to the optical axis in a crystal then pleochroism results.    Anisotropic crystals have double refraction of light where light of different polarizations is bent different amounts by the crystal, and therefore follows different paths through the crystal. 

USS Akron (ZRS-4)<====>60944<====>USS Akron (ZRS-4) DISPLAYTITLE   USS Akron (ZRS-4) was a helium-filled rigid airship of the U. S.  Navy which operated between September 1931 and April 1933.  She was the world's first purpose-built flying aircraft carrier, carrying F9C Sparrowhawk fighter planes which could be launched and recovered while she was in flight.  With an overall length of  , the Akron and her sister ship the   were among the largest flying objects ever built.  Although the LZ129 Hindenburg and the LZ130 Graf Zeppelin II were some   longer and slightly more voluminous, the two German airships were filled with hydrogen, so the US Navy craft still hold the world record for helium-filled airships. 

Airdrie, North Lanarkshire<====>60948<====>Airdrie, North Lanarkshire   Airdrie ( ;  )  is a town in North Lanarkshire, Scotland.  It lies on a plateau roughly 400 ft (130 m) above sea level, and is approximately 12 miles (19 km) east of Glasgow city centre.  Historically part of Lanarkshire, Airdrie forms part of a conurbation with its neighbour Coatbridge, in the former district known as the Monklands.   , the town had a population of around 37,130.    NameThe origin of Airdrie's name first appeared in the Register of the Great Seal of Scotland (Registrum Magni Sigilii Regum Scotorum) in 1373 as Ardre. 

Cardamom<====>60951<====>Cardamom   Cardamom ( ), sometimes cardamon or cardamum,  is a spice made from the seeds of several plants in the genera Elettaria and Amomum in the family Zingiberaceae.  Both genera are native to the Indian Subcontinent (known as Elaichi in Hindi/Urdu-speaking India/Pakistan), Bhutan, Indonesia and Nepal.  They are recognized by their small seed pods: triangular in cross-section and spindle-shaped, with a thin papery outer shell and small black seeds; Elettaria pods are light green and smaller, while Amomum pods are larger and dark brown. The first references to trade in cardamom from Sri Lanka, where it is grown on a small scale in montane forests in the central mountain ranges, are from the 12th century CE. 

Black cardamom<====>60953<====>Black cardamom  Black cardamom, also known as hill cardamom,    Bengal cardamom,  greater cardamom,  Indian cardamom,  Nepal cardamom,  winged cardamom,  or brown cardamom, comes from either of two species in the family Zingiberaceae.  Its seed pods have a strong camphor-like flavor, with a smoky character derived from the method of drying. CharacteristicsThe pods are used as a spice, in a similar manner to the green Indian cardamom pods, but with a different flavor.  Unlike green cardamom, this spice is rarely used in sweet dishes.  Its smoky flavor and aroma derive from traditional methods of drying over open flames. 

Native Son<====>60956<====>Native Son  Native Son (1940) is a novel written by the African American author Richard Wright.   It tells the story of 20-year-old Bigger Thomas, an African American youth living in utter poverty in a poor area on Chicago's South Side in the 1930s.

Military tactics<====>60981<====>Military tactics  Military tactics are the science and art of organizing a military force, and the techniques for combining and using weapons and military units to engage and defeat an enemy in battle.   Changes in philosophy and technology have been reflected in changes to military tactics.   In contemporary military science, tactics are the lowest of three planning levels: (i) strategic, (ii) operational, and (iii) tactical.  The highest level of planning is strategy:  how force is translated into political objectives by bridging the means and ends of war.  The intermediate level, operational, the conversion of strategy into tactics, deals with formations of units.

Firefly<====>60996<====>Firefly   The Lampyridae are a family of insects in the beetle order Coleoptera.  They are winged beetles,  commonly called fireflies or lightning bugs for their conspicuous use of bioluminescence during twilight to attract mates or prey.  Fireflies produce a "cold light", with no infrared or ultraviolet frequencies.  This chemically produced light from the lower abdomen may be yellow, green, or pale red, with wavelengths from 510 to 670 nanometers.  About 2,000 species of fireflies are found in temperate and tropical climates.  Many are in marshes or in wet, wooded areas where their larvae have abundant sources of food. 

Portable Distributed Objects<====>61001<====>Portable Distributed ObjectsPortable Distributed Objects (PDO) is an application programming interface (API) for creating object-oriented code that can be executed remotely on a network of computers.  It was created by NeXT Computer, Inc.  using their OpenStep system, whose use of Objective-C made the package very easy to write.  It was characterized by its very light weight and high speed in comparison to similar systems such as CORBA. Versions of PDO were available for Solaris, HP-UX and all versions of the OPENSTEP system.  A version that worked with Microsoft OLE was also available called D'OLE,  allowing distributed code written using PDO on any platform to be presented on Microsoft systems as if they were local OLE objects. 

Gerardus Mercator<====>61002<====>Gerardus Mercator    Gerardus Mercator (5 March 1512 – 2 December 1594) was a 16th-century German-Flemish cartographer, geographer and cosmographer.  He was renowned for creating the 1569 world map based on a new projection which represented sailing courses of constant bearing (rhumb lines) as straight lines—an innovation that is still employed in nautical charts. Mercator was one of the founders of the Netherlandish school of cartography and is widely considered as the most notable representative of the school in its golden age (approximately 1570s–1670s).  In his own day he was the world's most famous geographer but, in addition, he had interests in theology, philosophy, history, mathematics and geomagnetism as well as being an accomplished engraver, calligrapher and maker of globes and scientific instruments. 

Prototype-based programming<====>61003<====>Prototype-based programming  Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which behaviour reuse (known as inheritance) is performed via a process of reusing existing objects  via delegation that serve as prototypes.  This model can also be known as prototypal, prototype-oriented, classless, or instance-based programming.  Delegation is the language feature that supports prototype-based programming. Prototype object oriented programming uses generalized objects, which can then be cloned and extended.  Using fruit as an example, a "fruit" object would represent the properties and functionality of fruit in general.  A "banana" object would be cloned from the "fruit" object, and would also be extended to include general properties specific to bananas.

List of bend knots<====>61008<====>List of bend knotsThis is a list of bends.  A bend is a knot used to join two lengths of rope.  Although the reef knot can be used in this way, it is insecure when used as a bend and so is not classed as one. The sheet bend is the classic bend.   A study of 8 different bends using climbing rope found that the Butterfly bend was strongest, but recommended the double fisherman's knot for being easier to untie.

West<====>61026<====>West  West is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass.  It is the opposite direction from east. EtymologyThe word "west" is a Germanic word passed into some Romance languages (ouest in French, oest in Catalan, ovest in Italian, oeste in Spanish and Portuguese).  As is apparent in the Gothic term vasi (Visigoths), it stems from the same Indo-European root that gave the Sanskrit vas-ati (night) and vesper (evening) in Latin. NavigationTo go west using a compass for navigation, one needs to set a bearing or azimuth of 270°. West is the direction opposite that of the Earth's rotation on its axis, and is therefore the general direction towards which the Sun appears to constantly progress and eventually set. 

East<====>61028<====>East East is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass.  It is the opposite direction from west. EtymologyThe word east comes from Middle English est, from Old English ēast, which itself comes from the Proto-Germanic *aus-to- or *austra- "east, toward the sunrise", from Proto-Indo-European *aus- "to shine," or "dawn".   This is similar to Old High German *ōstar "to the east", Latin aurora "dawn", and Greek ēōs or heōs.   Ēostre, a Germanic goddess of dawn, might have been a personification of both dawn and the cardinal points. NavigationBy convention, the right hand side of a map is east. 

Rationality<====>61032<====>Rationality  Rationality is the quality or state of being rational: based on or agreeable to reason.    Rationality implies the conformity of one's beliefs with one's reasons to believe, or of one's actions with one's reasons for action.  "Rationality" has different specialized meanings in philosophy,  economics, sociology, psychology, evolutionary biology, game theory and political science. To determine what behavior is the most rational, one needs to make several key assumptions, and also needs a quantifiable formulation  of the problem.  When the goal or problem involves making a decision, rationality factors in how much information is available (e.

DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness. Since bubbles can form in or migrate to any part of the body, DCS can produce many symptoms, and its effects may vary from joint pain and rashes to paralysis and death.

Deductive reasoning<====>61093<====>Deductive reasoningDeductive reasoning, also deductive logic, logical deduction is the process of reasoning from one or more statements (premises) to reach a logically certain conclusion.   Deductive reasoning goes in the same direction as that of the conditionals, and links premises with conclusions.  If all premises are true, the terms are clear, and the rules of deductive logic are followed, then the conclusion reached is necessarily true. Deductive reasoning (top-down logic) contrasts with inductive reasoning (bottom-up logic) in the following way: In deductive reasoning, a conclusion is reached reductively by applying general rules that hold over the entirety of a closed domain of discourse, narrowing the range under consideration until only the conclusion(s) is left.

Roche limit<====>61097<====>Roche limit   In celestial mechanics, the Roche limit, also called Roche radius, is the distance in which a celestial body, held together only by its own gravity, will disintegrate due to a second celestial body's tidal forces exceeding the first body's gravitational self-attraction.Inside the Roche limit, orbiting material disperses and forms rings whereas outside the limit material tends to coalesce.   The term is named after Édouard Roche (pronounced /ʁɔʃ/), who is the French astronomer who first calculated this theoretical limit in 1848.    ExplanationTypically, the Roche limit applies to a satellite's disintegrating due to tidal forces induced by its primary, the body about which it orbits. 

Ethnic cleansing<====>61098<====>Ethnic cleansing   Ethnic cleansing is the systematic forced removal of ethnic or religious groups from a given territory by a more powerful ethnic group, often with the intent of making it ethnically homogeneous.    The forces applied may be various forms of forced migration (deportation, population transfer), intimidation, as well as mass murder and genocidal rape.

It is derived from the Latin arma, meaning "arms" (as in weapons) and -stitium, meaning "a stopping".  The United Nations Security Council often imposes, or tries to impose, cease-fire resolutions on parties in modern conflicts.  Armistices are always negotiated between the parties themselves and are thus generally seen as more binding than non-mandatory UN cease-fire resolutions in modern international law.

Taboo<====>61117<====>Taboo  A taboo is a vehement prohibition of an action based on the belief that such behavior is either too sacred or too   for ordinary individuals to undertake.  Encyclopædia Britannica Online.  "Taboo. " Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. , 2012.  Retrieved 21 Mar.  2012   Such prohibitions are present in virtually all societies.   On a comparative basis taboos, for example related to food items, seem to make no sense at all as what may be declared unfit for one group by custom or religion may be perfectly acceptable to another.  Whether scientifically correct or not, taboos are often meant to protect the human individual, but there are numerous other reasons for their existence. 

Load balancing (computing)<====>61118<====>Load balancing (computing) In computing, load balancing improves the distribution of workloads across multiple computing resources, such as computers, a computer cluster, network links, central processing units, or disk drives.   Load balancing aims to optimize resource use, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overload of any single resource.  Using multiple components with load balancing instead of a single component may increase reliability and availability through redundancy.   Load balancing usually involves dedicated software or hardware, such as a multilayer switch or a Domain Name System server process. Load balancing differs from channel bonding in that load balancing divides traffic between network interfaces on a network socket (OSI model layer 4) basis, while channel bonding implies a division of traffic between physical interfaces at a lower level, either per packet (OSI model Layer 3) or on a data link (OSI model Layer 2) basis with a protocol like shortest path bridging.

Robert Browning<====>61180<====>Robert Browning    Robert Browning (7 May 1812 – 12 December 1889) was an English poet and playwright whose mastery of the dramatic monologue made him one of the foremost Victorian poets.  His poems are known for their irony, characterization, dark humour, social commentary, historical settings, and challenging vocabulary and syntax. Browning's early career began promisingly, but was not a success.  The long poem Pauline brought him to the attention of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and was followed by Paracelsus, which was praised by William Wordsworth and Charles Dickens, but in 1840 the difficult Sordello, which was seen as wilfully obscure, brought his poetry into disrepute. 

The Way of All Flesh<====>61181<====>The Way of All Flesh    The Way of All Flesh (1903) is a semi-autobiographical novel by Samuel Butler that attacks Victorian-era hypocrisy.   Written between 1873 and 1884, it traces four generations of the Pontifex family.  Butler dared not publish it during his lifetime, but when it was published it was accepted as part of the general reaction against Victorianism. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked The Way of All Flesh twelfth on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Main charactersPontifex family.

The story revolves around the British plan to buy the Suez Canal and the efforts of two spies to stop it. 

Cauchy's integral theorem<====>61190<====>Cauchy's integral theorem  In mathematics, the Cauchy integral theorem (also known as the Cauchy–Goursat theorem) in complex analysis, named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy, is an important statement about line integrals for holomorphic functions in the complex plane.  Essentially, it says that if two different paths connect the same two points, and a function is holomorphic everywhere in between the two paths, then the two path integrals of the function will be the same. Statement of theoremThe theorem is usually formulated for closed paths as follows: let U be an open subset of C which is simply connected, let f : U → C be a holomorphic function, and let  \!\,\gamma  be a rectifiable path in U whose start point is equal to its end point. 

The Divorcee<====>61191<====>The Divorcee  The Divorcee is a 1930 American pre-Code drama film written by Nick Grindé, John Meehan, and Zelda Sears, based on the novel Ex-Wife by Ursula Parrott.

PlotTed (Chester Morris), Jerry (Norma Shearer), Paul (Conrad Nagel), and Dorothy (Helen Johnson) are part of the New York in-crowd.  Jerry's decision to marry Ted crushes Paul.  He gets drunk and is involved in an accident that leaves Dorothy's face disfigured. 

Externality<====>61193<====>Externality In economics, an externality is the cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit.    Economists often urge governments to adopt policies that "internalize" an externality, so that costs and benefits will affect mainly parties who choose to incur them.  For example, manufacturing activities that cause air pollution impose health and clean-up costs on the whole society, whereas the neighbors of an individual who chooses to fire-proof his home may benefit from a reduced risk of a fire spreading to their own houses.  If external costs exist, such as pollution, the producer may choose to produce more of the product than would be produced if the producer were required to pay all associated environmental costs. 

A Prairie Home Companion<====>61194<====>A Prairie Home Companion   A Prairie Home Companion was a live weekly radio variety show created and hosted by Garrison Keillor from 1974 to 2016.  In 2016, musician Chris Thile took over as host, and the successor show was eventually renamed Live from Here.  The show aired on Saturdays from the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul, Minnesota; it was also frequently heard on tours to New York City and other US cities.  The show is known for its musical guests, especially folk and traditional musicians, tongue-in-cheek radio drama, and relaxed humor.  Keillor's wry storytelling segment, "News from Lake Wobegon", was the show's best-known feature during his long tenure.

Vermes<====>61202<====>Vermes Vermes ("worms") is an obsolete taxon used by Carl Linnaeus for all non-arthropod invertebrate animals.  In Linnaeus system the group had the rank of class, occupying the 6th (and last) slot of his animal systematics.  The class was divided into the following orders: IntestinaMolluscaTestaceaLithophytaZoophytaApart from the Mollusca (molluscs), Linnaeus included a very diverse and rather mismatched assemblage of animals in the categories.  The Intestina group encompassed various parasitic animals, among them the hagfish, which Linnaeus would have found in dead fish.   Shelled molluscs were placed in the Testacea, together with barnacles and tube worms. 

Potsdam Declaration<====>61207<====>Potsdam Declaration  The Potsdam Declaration or the Proclamation Defining Terms for Japanese Surrender is a statement that called for the surrender of all Japanese armed forces during World War II.  On July 26, 1945, United States President Harry S.  Truman, United Kingdom Prime Minister Clement Attlee, and Chairman of the Nationalist Government of China Chiang Kai-shek issued the document, which outlined the terms of surrender for the Empire of Japan as agreed upon at the Potsdam Conference.  This ultimatum stated that, if Japan did not surrender, it would face "prompt and utter destruction".Terms of the DeclarationOn July 26, the United States, Britain, and China released the Potsdam Declaration announcing the terms for Japan's surrender, with the warning, "We will not deviate from them. 

Abu Qir<====>61209<====>Abu Qir  {{Infobox settlement  }} Abu Qir ( , Abu Qīr,   or [æbo-ʔiːɾ],    ), formerly also spelled Abukir or Aboukir,  is a town on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt, near the ruins of ancient Canopus and   northeast of Alexandria by rail.  It is located on Abu Qir Peninsula, with Abu Qir Bay to the east.   NameThe town's present name is Arabic for "Father Cyrus", an Egyptian Christian  martyr.  History Near the village are many remains of ancient buildings, Egyptian, Greek and Roman.  About   southeast of the village are the ruins of Canopus. 

Anatase<====>61211<====>Anatase  Anatase is one of the three mineral forms of titanium dioxide, the other two being brookite and rutile.  It is always found as small, isolated and sharply developed crystals, and like rutile, a more commonly occurring modification of titanium dioxide, it crystallizes in the tetragonal system; but, although the degree of symmetry is the same for both, there is no relation between the interfacial angles of the two minerals, except in the prism-zone of 45° and 90°.  The common pyramid of anatase, parallel to the faces of which there are perfect cleavages, has an angle over the polar edge of 82°9', the corresponding angle of rutile being 56°52½'. 

Laurent series<====>61213<====>Laurent series In mathematics, the Laurent series of a complex function f(z) is a representation of that function as a power series which includes terms of negative degree.  It may be used to express complex functions in cases wherea Taylor series expansion cannot be applied.  The Laurent series was namedafter and first published by Pierre Alphonse Laurent in 1843. Karl Weierstrass may have discovered it first in a paper written in 1841, but it was not published until after his death.  The Laurent series for a complex function f(z) about a point c is given by: f(z)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty a_n(z-c)^n where the a n  and c are constants, defined by a line integralwhich is a generalization of Cauchy's integral formula: a_n=\frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)\,\mathrm{d}z}{(z-c)^{n+1}}. 

Bolesław Bierut<====>61215<====>Bolesław Bierut Bolesław Bierut ( ; 18 April 1892 – 12 March 1956) was a Polish Communist leader, NKVD agent,    and a hard-line Stalinist who became President of Poland after the Soviet takeover of the country in the aftermath of  . LifeBierut was born in Rury, now a part of Lublin, to Wojciech Bierut, a village teacher, and his wife Maria (née Biernacka).  In 1918 he took courses at the Warsaw School of Economics.  From 1924–30, he was in Moscow for training at the school of the Communist International. In 1930–31, he was sent by the Comintern to Austria, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. 

Octahedrite<====>61218<====>Octahedrite Octahedrites are the most common structural class of iron meteorites.  The structures occur because the meteoric iron has a certain nickel concentration that leads to the exsolution of kamacite out of taenite while cooling. Structure Octahedrites derive their name from the crystal structure paralleling an octahedron.  Opposite faces are parallel so, although an octahedron has 8 faces, there are only 4 sets of kamacite plates. Due to a long cooling time in the interior of the parent asteroids, these alloys have crystallized into intermixed millimeter-sized bands (from about 0. 2 mm to 5 cm).  When polished and acid etched the classic Widmanstätten patterns of intersecting lines of lamellar kamacite, are visible. 

Spintronics<====>61220<====>Spintronics Spintronics (a portmanteau meaning spin transport electronics   ), also known as spin electronics, is the study of the intrinsic spin of the electron and its associated magnetic moment, in addition to its fundamental electronic charge, in solid-state devices . Spintronics fundamentally differs from traditional electronics in that, in addition to charge state, electron spins are exploited as a further degree of freedom, with implications in the efficiency of data storage and transfer.  Spintronic systems are most often realised in dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS) and Heusler alloys and are of particular interest in the field of quantum computing. 

École nationale supérieure des télécommunications de Bretagne<====>61221<====>École nationale supérieure des télécommunications de Bretagne   Telecom Bretagne (formerly known as ENST Bretagne) is one of the top French public institutions of higher education and research (Grandes Écoles) of engineering in France, and a high standard research centre providing high level training in Information Technologies and telecommunications.

Compass-and-straightedge construction<====>61229<====>Compass-and-straightedge construction  Compass-and-straightedge construction, also known as ruler-and-compass construction or classical construction, is the construction of lengths, angles, and other geometric figures using only an idealized ruler and compass. The idealized ruler, known as a straightedge, is assumed to be infinite in length, and has no markings on it with only one edge.  The compass is assumed to collapse when lifted from the page, so may not be directly used to transfer distances.  (This is an unimportant restriction since, using a multi-step procedure, a distance can be transferred even with collapsing compass; see compass equivalence theorem. ) More formally, the only permissible constructions are those granted by Euclid's first three postulates. 

Candy<====>61230<====>CandyCandy, also called sweets or lollies, is a confection that features sugar as a principal ingredient.   The category, called sugar confectionery, encompasses any sweet confection, including chocolate, chewing gum, and sugar candy.  Vegetables, fruit, or nuts which have been glazed and coated with sugar are said to be candied. Physically, candy is characterized by the use of a significant amount of sugar or sugar substitutes.   Unlike a cake or loaf of bread that would be shared among many people, candies are usually made in smaller pieces.   However, the definition of candy also depends upon how people treat the food. 

List of former counties of Quebec<====>61245<====>List of former counties of Quebec Historic counties  and territories in Quebec, Canada, followed by their respective county seats are listed below.  The list is sorted in alphabetical order by county name, but can also be sorted in alphabetical order by seat. In terms of internal divisions of counties, there are four types of counties:those that contain only townships, as is the case with those counties surveyed by the British after 1763;those that contain only parishes, as is the case with those counties chiefly in the Saint Lawrence Valley settled by French colonists prior to 1761;those that contain both townships and parishes, andthose that contain townships and undivided lands, as is the case with the northern counties outside the main populated areas of the province. 

Bacterial artificial chromosome<====>61255<====>Bacterial artificial chromosomeA bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) is a DNA construct, based on a functional fertility plasmid (or F-plasmid), used for transforming and cloning in bacteria, usually E.  coli.F-plasmids play a crucial role because they contain partition genes that promote the even distribution of plasmids after bacterial cell division.  The bacterial artificial chromosome's usual insert size is 150–350 kbp.A similar cloning vector called a PAC has also been produced from the DNA of P1 bacteriophage. BACs are often used to sequence the genome of organisms in genome projects, for example the Human Genome Project. 

Rod Steiger<====>61258<====>Rod Steiger  Rodney Stephen "Rod" Steiger (April 14, 1925 July 9, 2002) was an American actor, noted for his portrayal of offbeat, often volatile and crazed characters.  Cited as "one of Hollywood's most charismatic and dynamic stars",  he is closely associated with the art of method acting, embodying the characters he played, which at times led to clashes with directors and co-stars.  He starred as Marlon Brando's mobster brother Charlie in On the Waterfront (1954), the title character Sol Nazerman in The Pawnbroker (1964), and as police chief Bill Gillespie opposite Sidney Poitier in the film In the Heat of the Night (1967) which won him the Academy Award for Best Actor. 

Filling station<====>61260<====>Filling stationA filling station is a facility that sells fuel and engine lubricants for motor vehicles.  The most common fuels sold in the 2010s are gasoline (gasoline or gas in the U. S.  and Canada, generally petrol elsewhere) and diesel fuel.  A filling station that sells only electric energy is also known as a charging station, while a typical filling station can also be known as a  fuelling station, garage (South Africa, United Kingdom and Ireland), gasbar (Canada), gas station (United States and Canada), gasoline stand (Japan), petrol pump or petrol bunk (India), petrol garage, petrol station (Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, United Kingdom and Ireland), service station (Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom), a services (United Kingdom),  or servo (Australia). 

Lotus Seven<====>61261<====>Lotus Seven  The Lotus Seven is a small, simple, lightweight two-seater open-top sports car produced by the British manufacturer Lotus Cars (initially called Lotus Engineering)  between 1957 and 1972. It was designed by Lotus founder Colin Chapman and has been considered the embodiment of the Lotus philosophy of performance through low weight and simplicity.  The original model was highly successful with more than 2,500 cars sold,  due to its attraction as a road legal car that could be used for clubman racing.  After Lotus ended production of the Seven, Caterham bought the rights and today Caterham make both kits and fully assembled cars based on the original design.

Its   campus is located in Terre Haute, Indiana. ==History== FoundingFounder Chauncey Rose, along with nine friends, created the Terre Haute School of Industrial Science in 1874 to provide technical training after encountering difficulties in local engineer availability during construction of his railroads.  Mr.  Rose donated the land on 13th and Locust St.  and the majority of the funds needed to start the new school.  A year later, the cornerstone of the new institution was laid and the name was changed to Rose Polytechnic Institute despite the objections of the president of the board of managers and chief benefactor, Mr. 

Kit car<====>61264<====>Kit car  A kit car is an automobile that is available as a set of parts that a manufacturer sells and the buyer then assembles into a functioning car.  Usually, many of the major mechanical systems such as the engine and transmission are sourced from donor vehicles or purchased new from other vendors.  Kits vary in completeness, consisting of as little as a book of plans, or as much as a complete set with all components included except donor vehicle parts. There is also a sub-set of the kit car, commonly referred to as a "re-body", in which a commercially manufactured vehicle has a new (often fiberglass) body put on the running chassis.

She made a name for herself with her first book series, The Song of the Lioness (1983–1988), which followed the main character Alanna through the trials and triumphs of training as a knight. Pierce won the Margaret A.  Edwards Award from the Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA) of the American Library Association in 2013, citing her two quartets Song of the Lioness and Protector of the Small (1999–2002).  The annual award recognizes one writer and a particular body of work for "significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature". 

Greater London Council<====>61268<====>Greater London CouncilThe Greater London Council (GLC) was the top-tier local government administrative body for Greater London from 1965 to 1986.  It replaced the earlier London County Council (LCC) which had covered a much smaller area.  The GLC was dissolved in 1986 by the Local Government Act 1985 and its powers were devolved to the London boroughs and other entities.  A new administrative body, known as the Greater London Authority (GLA), was established in 2000. CreationThe GLC was established by the London Government Act 1963, which sought to create a new body covering all of London rather than just the inner part of the conurbation, additionally including and empowering newly created London boroughs within the overall administrative structure. 

Piophilidae<====>61270<====>Piophilidae  The Piophilidae are a family of "true flies", in the order Diptera.  The so-called cheese flies are the best-known members, but most species of the Piophilidae are scavengers in animal products, carrion, and fungi.  They may accordingly be important in forensic entomology    and medical entomology.For a fly maggot, the larvae of many species have an unusually well-developed ability to leap when alarmed or when abandoning their larval food to pupate; they accordingly may be known as cheese skippers or other kinds of skippers according to their food source. 

Auxiliary power unit<====>61271<====>Auxiliary power unit  An auxiliary power unit (APU) is a device on a vehicle that provides energy for functions other than propulsion.   They are commonly found on large aircraft and naval ships as well as some large land vehicles.   Aircraft APUs generally produce 115 V alternating current (AC) at 400 Hz (rather than 50/60 Hz in mains supply), to run the electrical systems of the aircraft; others can produce 28 V direct current (DC).APUs can provide power through single- or three-phase systems. Transport aircraftFunctionThe primary purpose of an aircraft APU is to provide power to start the main engines. 

Supersonic speed<====>61273<====>Supersonic speed Supersonic travel is a rate of travel of an object that exceeds the speed of sound (Mach 1).  For objects traveling in dry air of a temperature of 20 °C (68 °F) at sea level, this speed is approximately 343 m/s, 1,125 ft/s, 768 mph, 667 knots, or 1,235 km/h.  Speeds greater than five times the speed of sound (Mach 5) are often referred to as hypersonic.  Flights during which only some parts of the air surrounding an object, such as the ends of rotor blades, reach supersonic speeds are called transonic.  This occurs typically somewhere between Mach 0. 8 and Mach 1. 23. 

Unisys<====>61274<====>Unisys  Unisys Corporation is an American global information technology company based in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, that provides a portfolio of IT services, software, and technology.  It is the legacy proprietor of the Burroughs and UNIVAC line of computers, formed when the former bought the latter. HistoryUnisys was formed in 1986 through the merger of mainframe corporations Sperry and Burroughs, with Burroughs buying Sperry for $4. 8 billion.   The name was chosen from over 31,000 submissions in an internal competition when Chuck Ayoub submitted the word "Unisys" which was composed of parts of the words united, information and systems. 

Cathodoluminescence<====>61275<====>CathodoluminescenceCathodoluminescence is an optical and electromagnetic phenomenon in which electrons impacting on a luminescent material such as a phosphor, cause the emission of photons which may have wavelengths in the visible spectrum.  A familiar example is the generation of light by an electron beam scanning the phosphor-coated inner surface of the screen of a television that uses a cathode ray tube.  Cathodoluminescence is the inverse of the photoelectric effect, in which electron emission is induced by irradiation with photons. OriginLuminescence in a semiconductor results when an electron in the conduction band recombines with a hole in the valence band. 

2002 Tour de France<====>61277<====>2002 Tour de France The 2002 Tour de France was a multiple-stage bicycle race held from 6 to 28 July, and the 89th edition of the Tour de France.  The event started in Luxembourg and ended in Paris.  The Tour circled France counter-clockwise, visiting the Pyrenees before the Alps.  It has no overall winner—although American cyclist Lance Armstrong originally won the event, the United States Anti-Doping Agency announced in August 2012 that they had disqualified Armstrong from all his results since 1998, including his seven Tour de France wins from 1999 to 2005; the Union Cycliste Internationale has confirmed this verdict. 

John Wayne Gacy<====>61279<====>John Wayne Gacy    John Wayne Gacy Jr.  (March 17, 1942 – May 10, 1994) was an American serial killer and rapist.  He sexually assaulted, tortured and murdered at least 33 teenage boys and young men between 1972 and 1978 in Cook County, Illinois (a part of metropolitan Chicago). All of Gacy's known murders were committed inside his Norwood Park ranch house.  His victims were typically induced to his address by force or deception, and all but one of his victims were murdered by either asphyxiation or strangulation with a makeshift tourniquet; his first victim was stabbed to death. 

Frank R. Stockton<====>61280<====>Frank R.  Stockton  Frank Richard Stockton (April 5, 1834 – April 20, 1902) was an American writer and humorist, best known today for a series of innovative children's fairy tales that were widely popular during the last decades of the 19th century. LifeBorn in Philadelphia in 1834, Stockton was the son of a prominent Methodist minister who discouraged him from a writing career.  After marrying Mary Ann Edwards Tuttle, he and his wife moved to Burlington, New Jersey, Theodore F.  Wolfe, M. D.  “A Bookish Corner of New Jersey”, Lippincott's Monthly Magazine, Volume 65 ( J. 

Zine<====>61283<====>Zine  A zine (   ; short for magazine or fanzine) is most commonly a small-circulation self-published work of original or appropriated texts and images, usually reproduced via photocopier.  Usually zines are the product of a single person, or of a very small group.  Zines first emerged in the United States, where the photocopier was invented, and have always been more numerous there. Popularly defined as having a circulation of 1,000 or fewer copies, in practice many zines are produced in editions of fewer than 100.  The primary intent of publication is to advance the views of the editor rather than profit, since the time and materials necessary to create a zine are seldom matched by revenue from its sale. 

Colfax Avenue<====>61288<====>Colfax Avenue  Colfax Avenue is the main street that runs east–west through the Denver-Aurora metropolitan area in Colorado.  As U. S.  Highway 40, it was one of two principal highways serving Denver before the Interstate Highway System was constructed.  In the local street system, it lies 15 blocks north of the zero meridian (Ellsworth Avenue, one block south of 1st Avenue), and would thus otherwise be known as 15th Avenue.  The street was named for the 19th-century politician Schuyler Colfax.  From west to east, it starts at Heritage Road in Golden as U. S. 

Forensic entomology<====>61289<====>Forensic entomology Forensic entomology is the scientific study of the invasion of the succession pattern of arthropods with their developmental stages of different species found on the decomposed cadavers during legal investigations.  It is the application and study of insect and other arthropod biology to criminal matters.  It also involves the application of the study of arthropods, including insects, arachnids, centipedes, millipedes, and crustaceans to criminal or legal cases.  It is primarily associated with death investigations; however, it may also be used to detect drugs and poisons, determine the location of an incident, and find the presence and time of the infliction of wounds.

Forensic palynology<====>61305<====>Forensic palynology  Forensic palynology is the study of pollen, spores and other acid-resistant microscopic plant bodies, including dinoflagellates, to prove or disprove a relationship between objects, people and places that pertain to both criminal and civil cases.  Pollen can tell a lot about where a person or object has been, because regions of the world, countries, and even different parts of a garden will have a distinctive pollen assemblage. Pollen evidence can also reveal the season in which a particular object picked up the pollen.   Pollen has been used to trace activity at mass graves in Bosnia,  catch a burglar who brushed against a Hypericum bush during a crime,  and has even been proposed as an additive for bullets to enable tracking them. 

Mosaic<====>61309<====>MosaicA mosaic is a piece of art or image made from the assemblage of small pieces of colored glass, stone, or other materials.  It is often used in decorative art or as interior decoration.  Most mosaics are made of small, flat, roughly square, pieces of stone or glass of different colors, known as tesserae.  Some, especially floor mosaics, are made of small rounded pieces of stone, and called "pebble mosaics". Mosaics have a long history, starting in Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium BC.  Pebble mosaics were made in Tiryns in Mycenean Greece; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times, both in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. 

Stirling<====>61311<====>Stirling  Stirling ( ;  ;    ) is a city in central Scotland.  The market town, surrounded by rich farmland, grew up connecting the royal citadel, the medieval old town with its merchants and tradesmen,  the bridge and the port.  Located on the River Forth, Stirling is the administrative centre for the Stirling council area, and is traditionally the county town of Stirlingshire.  Proverbially it is the strategically important "Gateway to the Highlands". It has been said that "Stirling, like a huge brooch clasps Highlands and Lowlands together".    Similarly "he who holds Stirling, holds Scotland" is often quoted. 

Galois theory<====>61316<====>Galois theoryIn mathematics, more specifically in abstract algebra, Galois theory, named after Évariste Galois, provides a connection between field theory and group theory.  Using Galois theory, certain problems in field theory can be reduced to group theory, which is in some sense simpler and better understood. Originally, Galois used permutation groups to describe how the various roots of a given polynomial equation are related to each other.  The modern approach to Galois theory, developed by Richard Dedekind, Leopold Kronecker and Emil Artin, among others, involves studying automorphisms of field extensions. Further abstraction of Galois theory is achieved by the theory of Galois connections. 

Shannara<====>61317<====>Shannara   Shannara    is a series of high fantasy  novels written by Terry Brooks, beginning with The Sword of Shannara in 1977 and continuing through The Black Elfstone which was released in June 2017; there is also a prequel, First King of Shannara.  The series blends magic and primitive technology and is set in the Four Lands, which are identified as Earth long after civilization was destroyed in a chemical and nuclear holocaust called the Great Wars.  By the time of the prequel First King of Shannara, the world had reverted to a pre-industrial state and magic had re-emerged to supplement science. 

Alcibiades<====>61322<====>Alcibiades  Alcibiades, son of Cleinias, from the deme of Scambonidae ( ;  Greek:  , transliterated Alkibiádēs Kleiníou Skambōnídēs; c.  450–404 BC), was a prominent Athenian  , orator, and general.  He was the last famous member of his mother's aristocratic family, the Alcmaeonidae, which fell from prominence after the Peloponnesian War.  He played a major role in the second half of that conflict as a strategic advisor, military commander, and politician. During the course of the Peloponnesian War, Alcibiades changed his political allegiance several times.  In his native Athens in the early 410s BC, he advocated an aggressive foreign policy and was a prominent proponent of the Sicilian Expedition, but he fled to Sparta after his political enemies brought charges of sacrilege against him. 

The Love Parade<====>61323<====>The Love Parade  The Love Parade is a 1929 American pre-Code musical comedy film about the marital difficulties of Queen Louise of Sylvania (Jeanette MacDonald) and her consort, Count Alfred Renard (Maurice Chevalier).  Despite his love for Louise and his promise to be an obedient husband, Count Alfred finds his role as a figurehead unbearable. The film was directed by Ernst Lubitsch from a screenplay by Guy Bolton and Ernest Vajda, adapted from the French play Le Prince Consort,  written by Jules Chancel and Leon Xanrof; which had previously been adapted for Broadway in 1905 by William Boosey and Cosmo Gordon Lennox. 

Alice Adams (novel)<====>61324<====>Alice Adams (novel) Alice Adams is a 1921 novel by Booth Tarkington that received the 1922 Pulitzer Prize for the Novel.  It was adapted as a film in 1923 by Rowland V.  Lee and, more famously, in 1935 by George Stevens.  The narrative centers on the character of a young woman (the eponymous Alice Adams) who aspires to climb the social ladder and win the affections of a wealthy young man named Arthur Russell.  The story is set in a lower-middle-class household in an unnamed town in the Midwest shortly after World War I. PlotThe novel begins with Virgil Adams confined to bed with an unnamed illness. 

Wilhelm Röntgen<====>61325<====>Wilhelm Röntgen Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen ( ;   ; 27 March 1845 – 10 February 1923) was a German    mechanical engineer and physicist, who, on 8 November 1895, produced and detected electromagnetic radiation in a wavelength range known as X-rays or Röntgen rays, an achievement that earned him the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901.  Novelize, Robert.  Squire's Fundamentals of Radiology.  Harvard University Press.  5th edition.  1997.    p.  1.   In honour of his accomplishments, in 2004 the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) named element 111, roentgenium, a radioactive element with multiple unstable isotopes, after him. 

Hippopotamidae<====>61328<====>HippopotamidaeThis is the article on the family Hippopotamidae; for the main article on hippos, see Hippopotamus Hippopotamuses  are stout, naked-skinned, and amphibious artiodactyl members (and the only living members) of the family Hippopotamidae possessing three-chambered stomachs and walking on four toes on each foot.  While they resemble pigs physiologically and are pseudoruminants like camels, their closest living relatives are the cetaceans (whales and dolphins). There are two living species of hippopotamus in two genera; the pygmy hippo, Choeropsis liberiensis of the forests of west Africa, and the common hippo, Hippopotamus amphibius. CharacteristicsHippopotamuses are large mammals, with short, stumpy legs, and barrel-shaped bodies. 

Midsummer in New York City<====>61332<====>Midsummer in New York CityNYC Midsummer or Swedish Midsummer is a Swedish midsummer celebration organized since 1996 in one of New York City's parks on the Friday afternoon close to the June solstice, or St John's Day.  For several years now, Battery Park City in lower Manhattan has hosted this event.  A sizable portion of the Swedish expatriate community in NYC shows up to celebrate Midsummer the Swedish way.  The event in Battery Park City is co-hosted by the Swedish consulate and Hugh L.  Carey Battery Park City Authority. Midsummer is one of the year's great family holidays in the Scandinavian countries, since long before Christianization. 

Pygmy hippopotamus<====>61334<====>Pygmy hippopotamus  The pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis or Hexaprotodon liberiensis) is a small hippopotamid which is native to the forests and swamps of West Africa, primarily in Liberia, with small populations in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Ivory Coast. The pygmy hippo is reclusive and nocturnal.  It is one of only two extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being its much larger relative, the common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius).  The pygmy hippopotamus displays many terrestrial adaptations, but like the hippo, it is semiaquatic and relies on water to keep its skin moist and its body temperature cool. 

Addition<====>61338<====>Addition   Addition (often signified by the plus symbol "+") is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic, with the others being subtraction, multiplication and division.  The addition of two whole numbers is the total amount of those quantities combined.  For example, in the picture on the right, there is a combination of three apples and two apples together, making a total of five apples.  This observation is equivalent to the mathematical expression   i. e. , "3 add 2 is equal to 5". Besides counting fruits, addition can also represent combining other physical objects. 

Balderdash<====>61339<====>Balderdash  Balderdash is a board game of bluffing and trivia created by Laura Robinson and Paul Toyne of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  The game was first released in 1984 under Canada Games.  It was later picked up by a U. S company, The Games Gang, and eventually became the property of Hasbro and finally Mattel.  The game is based on a classic parlor game called Fictionary.  The game has sold over 15 million copies worldwide to date.  It is aimed at fans of word games, such as Scrabble. GameplayThe game begins by all players rolling a die, with the high roll chosen to be the first "dasher". 

Lightning<====>61344<====>Lightning    Lightning is a sudden electrostatic discharge that occurs typically during a thunderstorm.   This discharge occurs between electrically charged regions of a cloud (called intra-cloud lightning or IC), between two clouds (CC lightning), or between a cloud and the ground (CG lightning). The charged regions in the atmosphere temporarily equalize themselves through this discharge referred to as a flash.  A lightning flash can also be a strike if it involves an object on the ground.  Lightning creates light in the form of black body radiation from the very hot plasma created by the electron flow, and sound in the form of  thunder. 

Documentary hypothesis<====>61345<====>Documentary hypothesis    The documentary hypothesis (DH) is one of three models used to explain the origins and composition of the first five books of the Bible, The five books are Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.   called collectively the Torah or Pentateuch.  The other two theories are the supplementary hypothesis and the fragmentary hypothesis.    All three agree that the Torah is not a unified work from a single author (traditionally Moses) but is made up of sources combined over many centuries by many hands.  They differ on the nature of these sources and how they were combined. 

Commutative ring<====>61346<====>Commutative ringIn ring theory, a branch of abstract algebra, a commutative ring is a ring in which the multiplication operation is commutative.  The study of commutative rings is called commutative algebra.  Complementarily, noncommutative algebra is the study of noncommutative rings where multiplication is not or is not required to be commutative.  Definition and first examplesDefinition A ring is a set R equipped with two binary operations, i. e.  operations combining any two elements of the ring to a third.

Claudette Colbert<====>61350<====>Claudette Colbert  Claudette Colbert (September 13, 1903 – July 30, 1996) was an  American film actress and a leading lady in Hollywood for over two decades, and has been called "The mixture of inimitable beauty, sophistication, wit, and vivacity". Colbert began her career in Broadway productions during the late 1920s and progressed to motion pictures with the advent of sound film.  Initially associated with Paramount Pictures,  Colbert gradually shifted to working as a freelance actress.  She won the Academy Award for Best Actress in It Happened One Night (1934), and received two other Academy Award nominations. 

Laurent polynomial<====>61351<====>Laurent polynomial In mathematics, a Laurent polynomial (namedafter Pierre Alphonse Laurent) in one variable over a field  \mathbb{F}  is a linear combination of positive and negative powers of the variable with coefficients in  \mathbb{F} .  Laurent polynomials in X form a ring denoted  \mathbb{F} [X, X −1 ].   They differ from ordinary polynomials in that they may have terms of negative degree.  The construction of Laurent polynomials may be iterated, leading to the ring of Laurent polynomials in several variables.   Laurent polynomials are of particular importance in the study of complex variables. 

Norma Shearer<====>61354<====>Norma Shearer  Edith Norma Shearer (August 11, 1902 – June 12, 1983)   was a Canadian-American actress and Hollywood star from 1925 through 1942.   Shearer often played spunky, sexually liberated ingenues.   She appeared in adaptations of Noël Coward, Eugene O'Neill, and William Shakespeare  and was the first person to be nominated five times for an Academy Award for acting, winning Best Actress for her performance in the 1930 film The Divorcee.    Reviewing Shearer's work, Mick LaSalle called her "the exemplar of sophisticated 1930s womanhood. . .  exploring love and sex with an honesty that would be considered frank by modern standards". 

Oral law<====>61358<====>Oral lawAn oral law is a code of conduct in use in a given culture, religion or community application, by which a body of rules of human behaviour is transmitted by oral tradition and effectively respected, or the single rule that is orally transmitted. Many cultures have an oral law, while most contemporary legal systems have a formal written organisation.  The oral tradition (from the Latin tradere = to transmit) is the typical instrument of transmission of the oral codes or, in a more general sense, is the complex of what a culture transmits of itself among the generations, "from father to son". 

List of counties of Prince Edward Island<====>61360<====>List of counties of Prince Edward Island The Canadian province of Prince Edward Island has three counties that have historically been used as administrative divisions for the provincial government, and prior to Confederation (in 1873), the colonial government. The current system of land division in Prince Edward Island, including its three counties, dates to a series of surveys undertaken in 1764-65 by Captain Samuel Holland of the British Army's Corps of Royal Engineers.   Holland's survey saw the island divided into the three counties, each of which had a "royalty" (or shire town) as a county seat.   The rest of the county outside the royalty was sub-divided into parishes for the Church of England, measuring approximately  ; the parishes were further sub-divided into townships measuring approximately  . 

Boy's surface<====>61361<====>Boy's surfaceIn geometry, Boy's surface is an immersion of the real projective plane in 3-dimensional space found by Werner Boy in 1901 (he discovered it on assignment from David Hilbert to prove that the projective plane could not be immersed in 3-space).  Unlike the Roman surface and the cross-cap, it has no singularities (i. e. , pinch-points), but it does self-intersect. Boy's surface is discussed (and illustrated) in Jean-Pierre Petit's Topo the world.    Boy's surface was first parametrized explicitly by Bernard Morin in 1978.See below for another parametrization, discovered by Rob Kusner and Robert Bryant. 

Epacris impressa<====>61363<====>Epacris impressa   Epacris impressa, also known as common heath, is a plant of the heath family, Ericaceae, that is native to southeast Australia (the states of Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and New South Wales).  French botanist Jacques Labillardière collected the species in 1793 and described it in 1805.  Four forms have been identified, but no subspecies are recognised.  Growing in heathland, shrubland or open forest, it is generally a small shrub around   tall, with small stiff leaves.  The red, pink or white tube-like flowers appear from late autumn to early spring.  Honeyeaters, particularly the eastern spinebill, feed upon the nectar of the flowers. 

X.500<====>61366<====>X. 500X. 500 is a series of computer networking standards covering electronic directory services.   The X. 500 series was developed by ITU-T, formerly known as CCITT, and first approved in 1988.    The directory services were developed in order to support the requirements of X. 400 electronic mail exchange and name lookup.  ISO was a partner in developing the standards, incorporating them into the Open Systems Interconnection suite of protocols.   ISO/IEC 9594 is the corresponding ISO identification.  X. 500 protocolsThe protocols defined by X. 500 includeDAP (Directory Access Protocol)DSP (Directory System Protocol)DISP (Directory Information Shadowing Protocol)DOP (Directory Operational Bindings Management Protocol)Because these protocols used the OSI networking stack, a number of alternatives to DAP were developed to allow Internet clients to access the X. 

Ohio County, West Virginia<====>61368<====>Ohio County, West Virginia Ohio County is a county located in the Northern Panhandle of the U. S.  state of West Virginia.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 44,443.Its county seat is Wheeling.The county was formed from the District of West Augusta, Virginia in 1776.   It was named for the Ohio River, which forms its western boundary.   West Liberty (formerly Black's Cabin) was the county seat from 1777 to 1797. Ohio County is part of the Wheeling, WV-OH Metropolitan Statistical Area. GeographyAccording to the U. 

Rapid update cycle<====>61369<====>Rapid update cycle The Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) was an atmospheric prediction system that consisted primarily of a numerical forecast model and an analysis system to initialize the model. The RUC was designed to provide accurate short-range (0- to 12-hr, later expanded to 18-hr in 2010) numerical forecast guidance for weather-sensitive users, such as those in the aviation community.  Significant weather forecasting problems that occur in the 0- to 12-hr range include severe weather in all seasons (for example, tornadoes, thunderstorms, snow, and ice storms) and hazards to aviation (for example, clear air turbulence, icing, and downbursts).  The RUC ran at the highest frequency of any forecast model at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), assimilating recent observations to provide very high frequency updates of current conditions and short-range forecasts. 

Barbour County, West Virginia<====>61370<====>Barbour County, West Virginia  Barbour County is a county in north-central West Virginia, USA.  At the 2010 census, the population was 16,589.The county seat is Philippi,    which was chartered in 1844.  Both county and city were named for Philip Pendleton Barbour (1783–1841), a U. S.  Congressman from Virginia and Associate Justice of the U. S.  Supreme Court.  The county was formed in 1843  when the region was still part of the state of Virginia.   In 1871, a small part of Barbour County was transferred to Tucker County, West Virginia. 

Golden ratio base<====>61373<====>Golden ratio base Golden ratio base is a non-integer positional numeral system that uses the golden ratio (the irrational number   ≈ 1. 61803399 symbolized by the Greek letter φ) as its base.  It is sometimes referred to as base-φ, golden mean base, phi-base, or, colloquially, phinary.  Any non-negative real number can be represented as a base-φ numeral using only the digits 0 and 1, and avoiding the digit sequence "11" – this is called a standard form.   A base-φ numeral that includes the digit sequence "11" can always be rewritten in standard form, using the algebraic properties of the base φ — most notably that φ + 1 = φ 2 . 

Correa (plant)<====>61376<====>Correa (plant)DISPLAYTITLE Correa is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae, with bell-shaped flowers, native mainly to eastern Australia.  There are ca.  11 species in the genus and 26 subspecies.  Natural hybridisation between the species makes taxonomic relationships within this genus problematic.  There are also hundreds of named cultivars, many of which have been registered with the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority (ACRA).   The genus Correa is named after the Portuguese botanist José Correia da Serra (1750–1823), known as Abbé Correa.  SpeciesThe species are as follows:   Correa aemula  (Lindl. 

ObjectPAL<====>61379<====>ObjectPAL ObjectPAL is short for Object-Oriented Paradox Application Language, which is the programming language used by the Borland Paradox database application (now owned by Corel).  Paradox, now in its 11th version, is a constituent of Corel's Word Perfect X3 office suite, for 32-bit Microsoft Windows.   The language is tightly-bound to the application's forms, and provides a very rapid and robust development environment for creating database applications for Windows.   ObjectPAL is not a full free-standing object-oriented language.  It belongs to the family of languages inspired by Hypercard, with influences from PAL (wherever functionality could be kept the same), Smalltalk, and Garnet (a UI language created by Brad Myers). 

John Canaparius<====>61386<====>John CanapariusJohn Canaparius ( ) was a Benedictine monk at the Aventine monastery in Rome.  It had long been assumed that in the year 999 he wrote the first Vita sancti Adalberti episcopi Pragensis, or "Life of St.  Adalbert of Prague" just two years after Adalbert's death. Adalbert was sent by Pope Gregory V to convert the pagan Old Prussians to Christianity and had come to Prussia, apparently taking the route along the Vistula River to reach the Baltic Sea at „urbem Gyddanyzc“. ,  which is identified with the later Gdańsk (Danzig).  Then a small trading and fishing settlement with wooden buildings, it was anyway recorded by Canaparius as „urbs“, city. 

Deoxyribose<====>61388<====>Deoxyribose  Deoxyribose, or more precisely 2-deoxyribose, is a monosaccharide with idealized formula H−(C=O)−(CH 2 )−(CHOH) 3 −H.  Its name indicates that it is a deoxy sugar, meaning that it is derived from the sugar ribose by loss of an oxygen atom.  Since the pentose sugars arabinose and ribose only differ by the stereochemistry at C2′, 2-deoxyribose and 2-deoxyarabinose are equivalent, although the latter term is rarely used because ribose, not arabinose, is the precursor to deoxyribose. HistoryDeoxyribose was discovered in 1929 by Phoebus Levene.    StructureSeveral isomers exist with the formula H−(C=O)−(CH 2 )−(CHOH) 3 −H, but in deoxyribose all the hydroxyl groups are on the same side in the Fischer projection. 

Ribose<====>61389<====>Ribose Ribose is a carbohydrate with the formula C 5 H 10 O 5 ; specifically, it is a pentose monosaccharide (simple sugar) with linear form H−(C=O)−(CHOH) 4 −H, which has all the hydroxyl groups on the same side in the Fischer projection. The term may refer to either of two enantiomers.   The term usually indicates  D -ribose, which occurs widely in nature and is discussed here.   Its synthetic mirror image,  L -ribose, is not found in nature.  D -Ribose was first reported in 1891 by Emil Fischer.  It is a C'-2 carbon epimer of the sugar  D -arabinose (both isomers of which are named for their source, gum arabic) and ribose itself is named as a partial rearrangement of letters in the word 'arabinose'. 

1962 FIFA World Cup<====>61392<====>1962 FIFA World Cup  The 1962 FIFA World Cup was the 7th FIFA World Cup.  It was held from May 30 to June 17, 1962 in Chile.  Teams representing 57 national football associations from all six populated continents entered the competition, with its qualification process beginning in August 1960.  Fourteen teams qualified from this process, along with the host nation Chile and defending champion Brazil, for the finals tournament. The tournament was won by the defending world champions Brazil, who claimed their second World Cup title by defeating Czechoslovakia 3–1 in the final in the Chilean capital of Santiago, becoming the second team, after Italy in 1938, to successfully defend the world title. 

A. E. Waite<====>61396<====>A.  E.  Waite   Arthur Edward Waite (2 October 1857 – 19 May 1942), commonly known as A.  E.  Waite, was an American-born British poet and scholarly mystic who wrote extensively on occult and esoteric matters, and was the co-creator of the Rider-Waite Tarot deck.  As his biographer R.  A.  Gilbert described him, "Waite's name has survived because he was the first to attempt a systematic study of the history of western occultism—viewed as a spiritual tradition rather than as aspects of proto-science or as the pathology of religion. " Early lifeWaite was born in Brooklyn, New York, United States. 

Superpower<====>61398<====>Superpower  Superpower is a term used to describe a state with a dominant position, which is characterised by its extensive ability to exert influence or project power on a global scale.  This is done through the combined-means of economic, military, technological and cultural strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence.  Traditionally, superpowers are preeminent among the great powers. The term was first applied post World War II to the British Empire, the United States and the Soviet Union.  However, after the end of World War II and the Suez Crisis in 1956, the United Kingdom's status as a superpower was greatly diminished, leaving just the United States and Soviet Union as superpowers. 

Camprodon<====>61400<====>Camprodon  Camprodon ( ,  ; from Camp Rodó "Round Field", ultimately from Latin Campus Rotundus) is a small town in the comarca of Ripollès in Girona, Catalonia, Spain, located in the Pyrenees, near the French border. HistoryThe settlement of Camprodon was in 1118, when Ramon Berenguer III allowed the building of a market near the monastery of Sant Pere de Camprodon, which is located in the present-day town.  In 1252, Camprodon was granted the title of royal city and left the jurisdiction of the abbot of Sant Pere. The city celebrates the feast day of Sant Patllari (Palladius of Embrun), and the church of Santa Maria de Camprodon claims his relics, which lie in a 14th-century reliquary (arqueta de Sant Patllari). 

Figueres<====>61402<====>Figueres   Figueres ( , Catalan for fig trees) is the capital of the comarca of Alt Empordà, in the province of Girona, Catalonia, Spain. The town is the birthplace of artist Salvador Dalí, and houses the Teatre-Museu Gala Salvador Dalí, a large museum designed by Dalí himself which attracts many visitors.  It is also the birthplace of Narcís Monturiol, inventor of the first successful machine-powered submarine.  Also born here was Mónica Naranjo, one of the best selling Spanish singers of the 1990s and 2000s. HistoryThe town's name derives from that of Ficaris, of Visigoth origin.  In 1267, King James I of Aragon conceded it fuero rights, but four years later Count Ponç IV of Empúries set the town on fire. 

Winfield Scott<====>61403<====>Winfield Scott   Winfield Scott (June 13, 1786 – May 29, 1866) was a United States Army general and the unsuccessful presidential candidate of the Whig Party in 1852. Known as "Old Fuss and Feathers" and the "Grand Old Man of the Army", he served on active duty as a general longer than any other person in American history, is rated as one of the Army's most senior commissioned officers, and is ranked by many historians as the best American commander of his time.   Over the course of his 53-year career, he commanded forces in the War of 1812, the Black Hawk War, the Mexican–American War, and the Second Seminole War.

Louis Braille<====>61410<====>Louis Braille  Louis Braille ( ;  ; 4 January 1809 – 6 January 1852) was a French educator and inventor of a system of reading and writing for use by the blind or visually impaired.  His system remains virtually unchanged to this day, and is known worldwide simply as braille. Blinded in both eyes as a result of an early childhood accident, Braille mastered his disability while still a boy.  He excelled in his education and received scholarship to France's Royal Institute for Blind Youth.  While still a student there, he began developing a system of tactile code that could allow blind people to read and write quickly and efficiently. 

The Tomfoolery Show<====>61411<====>The Tomfoolery Show   The Tomfoolery Show is an American cartoon comedy television series made and first broadcast in 1970, based on the works of Edward Lear.  The animation was done at the Halas and Batchelor Studios in London and Stroud.  Though the works of other writers were also used, notably Lewis Carroll and Ogden Nash, Lear's works were the main source, and characters like the Yongy-Bonghy-Bo and the Umbrageous Umbrella Maker were all Lear creations.  Other regular characters included the Enthusiastic Elephant, the Fizzgiggious Fish, and the Scroobious Snake.  Some original material was also written based on characters created by Lear, although much of the material was a straight recital of poems and limericks or songs using Lear's poems set to music.

Kerio River<====>61414<====>Kerio River The Kerio River is a river in Turkana County, Kenya.  It flows northward into Lake Turkana.  It is one of the longest rivers in Kenya, originating near the equator. CourseThe Kerio River rises on the north slopes of the Amasya Hills to the west of Lake Bogoria.  It flows northward through the Kerio Valley between Tugen Hills and Elgeyo Escarpment. The Elgeyo Escarpment rises to over   above the Kerio valley in places.  The Kerio continues northward, often through deep and narrow valleys, to enter Lake Turkana in a delta just south of the delta formed by the Turkwel and Lokichar rivers. 

Alexander Cartwright<====>61416<====>Alexander Cartwright Alexander "Alick" Joy Cartwright Jr.  (April 17, 1820 – July 12, 1892) was a founding member of the New York Knickerbockers Base Ball Club in the 1840s.  Although an inductee of the Baseball Hall of Fame and sometimes referred to as a "father of baseball", the centrality of his role in the development of the game has been disputed. The rules of the modern game were long considered to have been based on the Knickerbocker Rules developed in 1845 by Cartwright and a committee from the Knickerbockers.  Later research called this scenario into question.   After the myth of Abner Doubleday having invented baseball in Cooperstown in 1839 was debunked, Cartwright was inducted into the Hall of Fame as a pioneering contributor 46 years after his death. 

Tokenization (data security)<====>61419<====>Tokenization (data security)Tokenization, when applied to data security, is the process of substituting a sensitive data element with a non-sensitive equivalent, referred to as a token, that has no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value.  The token is a reference (i. e.  identifier) that maps back to the sensitive data through a tokenization system.  The mapping from original data to a token uses methods which render tokens infeasible to reverse in the absence of the tokenization system, for example using tokens created from random numbers.   The tokenization system must be secured and validated using security best practices  applicable to sensitive data protection,  secure storage, audit, authentication and authorization. 

112 BC<====>61421<====>112 BC   Year 112 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Drusus and Caesoninus (or, less frequently, year 642 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 112 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

Radius of convergence<====>61476<====>Radius of convergenceIn mathematics, the radius of convergence of a power series is the radius of the largest disk in which the series converges.   It is either a non-negative real number or  \infty .   When it is positive, the power series converges absolutely and uniformly on compact sets inside the open disk of radius equal to the radius of convergence, and it is the Taylor series of the analytic function to which it converges. DefinitionFor a power series ƒ defined as: f(z) =  \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n (z-a)^n,  wherea is a  complex constant, the center of the disk of convergence,c n  is the n th  complex coefficient, andz is a complex variable. 

Analytic function<====>61478<====>Analytic function   In mathematics, an analytic function is a function that is locally given by a convergent power series.  There exist both real analytic functions and complex analytic functions, categories that are similar in some ways, but different in others.  Functions of each type are infinitely differentiable, but complex analytic functions exhibit properties that do not hold generally for real analytic functions.  A function is analytic if and only if its Taylor series about x 0  converges to the function in some neighborhood for every x 0  in its domain. DefinitionsFormally, a function  f  is real analytic on an open set  D  in the real line if for any  x_0\in D  one  can write f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_{n} \left( x-x_0 \right)^{n} = a_0 + a_1 (x-x_0) + a_2 (x-x_0)^2 + a_3 (x-x_0)^3 + \cdots in which the coefficients  a_0, a_1, \dots  are real numbers and the series is convergent to  f(x)  for  x  in a neighborhood of  x_0 .

Nestorius<====>61540<====>Nestorius    Nestorius ( ; in  ;   386 – 450 ) was Archbishop of Constantinople (now Istanbul) from 10 April 428 to August 431, when Emperor Theodosius II confirmed his condemnation by the Council of Ephesus on 22 June. His teachings included a rejection of the long-used title of Theotokos, "Mother of God", for Mary, mother of Jesus, and they were considered by many to imply that he did not believe that Christ was truly God.  That brought him into conflict with other prominent churchmen of the time, most notably Cyril of Alexandria, whom he accused of heresy. 

Juneteenth<====>61542<====>Juneteenth  Juneteenth, also known as Juneteenth Independence Day or Freedom Day, is an American holiday that commemorates the June 19, 1865 announcement of the abolition of slavery in the U. S.  state of Texas, and more generally the emancipation of enslaved African-Americans throughout the former Confederacy of the southern United States.  Celebrated on June 19, the word is a portmanteau of "June" and "nineteenth".    Juneteenth is recognized as a state holiday or special day of observance in forty-five states.The holiday is observed primarily in local celebrations.  Traditions include public readings of the Emancipation Proclamation, singing traditional songs such as "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" and "Lift Every Voice and Sing", and readings by noted African-American writers such as Ralph Ellison and Maya Angelou.

Black swan<====>61550<====>Black swan  The black swan (Cygnus atratus) is a large waterbird, a species of swan which breeds mainly in the southeast and southwest regions of Australia.  A New Zealand subspecies was apparently hunted to extinction by Māori, but the species was reintroduced to New Zealand in the 1860s.Within Australia they are nomadic, with erratic migration patterns dependent upon climatic conditions.  Black swans are large birds with mostly black plumage and red bills.  They are monogamous breeders.  Male and female share incubation and cygnet rearing duty. Black swans were introduced to various countries as an ornamental bird in the 1800s, but have escaped and formed stable populations. 

Jupiter-C<====>61551<====>Jupiter-C The Jupiter-C was an American research and development vehicle   developed from the Jupiter-A.  Jupiter-C was used for three sub-orbital spaceflights  in 1956 and 1957 to test re-entry nosecones that were later to be deployed on the more advanced PGM-19 Jupiter mobile missile. A member of the Redstone rocket family, Jupiter-C was designed by the U. S.  Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA), under the direction of Wernher von Braun.Three Jupiter-C flights were made followed by three satellite launches (Juno I).    All were launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. 

Juno I<====>61552<====>Juno I   The Juno I was a four-stage American booster rocket which launched America's first satellite, Explorer 1, in 1958.  A member of the Redstone rocket family, it was derived from the Jupiter-C sounding rocket.   It is commonly confused with the Juno II launch vehicle, which was derived from the PGM-19 Jupiter medium-range ballistic missile. DevelopmentThe Juno I consisted of a Jupiter-C rocket with a fourth stage mounted on top of the "tub" of the third stage, which was fired after third-stage burnout to boost the payload and fourth stage to an orbital velocity of  . 

Tree fern<====>61553<====>Tree fern The tree ferns are the ferns that grow with a trunk elevating the fronds above ground level.  Most tree ferns are members of the "core tree ferns", belonging to the families Dicksoniaceae, Metaxyaceae, and Cibotiaceae in the order Cyatheales.  In addition to those families, many ferns in other groups may be considered tree ferns, such as several ferns in the family Osmundaceae, which can achieve short trunks under a metre tall, and particularly ferns in the genus Cibotium, which can grow ten metres tall.  Fern species with short trunks in the genera Blechnum, Calochleana, Cnemedaria, Culcita (Europe's only tree fern), Cystodium, Leptopteris, Lophosoria, Sadleria, Thyrsopteris and Todea could also be considered tree ferns in a liberal interpretation of the term.

He studied with drummer Alan Dawson at an early age, and began playing professionally at the age of 13 with saxophonist Sam Rivers.  Saxophonist Jackie McLean hired Williams when he was 16. 

Archimedean spiral<====>61559<====>Archimedean spiralThe Archimedean spiral (also known as the arithmetic spiral) is a spiral named after the 3rd century BC Greek mathematician Archimedes.  It is the locus of points corresponding to the locations over time of a point moving away from a fixed point with a constant speed along a line which rotates with constant angular velocity.  Equivalently, in polar coordinates (r, θ) it can be described by the equation \, r=a+b\theta with real numbers a and b.  Changing the parameter a will turn the spiral, while b controls the distance between successive turnings. Archimedes described such a spiral in his book On Spirals. 

Spiral<====>61563<====>Spiral  In mathematics, a spiral is a curve which emanates from a point, moving farther away as it revolves around the point. Helices  Two major definitions of "spiral" in the American Heritage Dictionary are: "Spiral, American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Houghton Mifflin Company, Fourth Edition, 2009.  a curve on a plane that winds around a fixed center point at a continuously increasing or decreasing distance from the point. a three-dimensional curve that turns around an axis at a constant or continuously varying distance while moving parallel to the axis; a helix. The first definition describes a planar curve, that extends in both of the perpendicular directions within its plane; the groove on one side of a record closely approximates a plane spiral (and it is by the finite width and depth of the groove, but not by the wider spacing between than within tracks, that it falls short of being a perfect example); note that successive loops differ in diameter. 

Australian House of Representatives<====>61565<====>Australian House of Representatives    The Australian House of Representatives  is one of the two Houses (chambers) of the Parliament of Australia.  It is referred to as the lower house, with the Senate being referred to as the upper house.  The term of members of the House of Representatives is a maximum of three years from the date of the first sitting of the House, but on only one occasion since Federation has the maximum term been reached.  The House is almost always dissolved earlier, usually alone but sometimes in a double dissolution of both Houses. 

Christoph Hartknoch<====>61567<====>Christoph HartknochChristoph Hartknoch (1644–1687) was a Prussian historian and educator. BiographyHartknoch was born in Jablonken (Jabłonka) near Ortelsburg (Szczytno) in the Duchy of Prussia.  In 1650 the family moved to Passenheim (Pasym)  and there witnessed the brutality and horrors of the Tatar attacks, fighting for the Kingdom of Poland, in southern Prussia.  His life was saved by his teacher, who shoved him out the window.  Numerous villages in the region were destroyed, but Hartknoch made it to the ducal capital of Königsberg (Królewiec). In Königsberg Hartknoch started studying theology at a Protestant institute.  Soon after his parents died and he had to take on jobs.

Electrical resistance and conductance<====>61577<====>Electrical resistance and conductance  The electrical resistance of an electrical conductor is a measure of the difficulty to pass an electric current through that conductor.  The inverse quantity is  , and is the ease with which an electric current passes.   Electrical resistance shares some conceptual parallels with the notion of mechanical friction.  The SI unit of electrical resistance is the ohm (Ω), while electrical conductance is measured in siemens (S). An object of uniform cross section has a resistance proportional to its resistivity and length and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area.  All materials show some resistance, except for superconductors, which have a resistance of zero.

Electrical resistivity and conductivity<====>61580<====>Electrical resistivity and conductivity Electrical resistivity (also known as resistivity, specific electrical resistance, or volume resistivity) is a fundamental property that quantifies how strongly a given material opposes the flow of electric current.  A low resistivity indicates a material that readily allows the flow of electric current.  Resistivity is commonly represented by the Greek letter ρ (rho).  The SI unit of electrical resistivity is the ohm-metre (Ω⋅m). As an example, if a   solid cube of material has sheet contacts on two opposite faces, and the resistance between these contacts is 1 Ω, then the resistivity of the material is 1 Ω⋅m. 

Taos art colony<====>61583<====>Taos art colonyThe Taos art colony is an art colony founded in Taos, New Mexico, by artists attracted by the rich culture of the Taos Pueblo and beautiful landscape.  Hispanic craftsmanship of furniture, tin work and more played a role in creating a multicultural tradition of art work in the area. In 1898 a visit of Bert Geer Phillips and Ernest L.  Blumenschein to Taos was one of the first steps in the creation of the Taos art colony and the Taos Society of Artists.  In addition to the society, Mabel Dodge Luhan was instrumental in promoting Taos to artists and writers within her circle. 

Ernest L. Blumenschein<====>61584<====>Ernest L.  Blumenschein  Ernest Leonard Blumenschein (May 26, 1874  – June 6, 1960) was an American artist and founding member of the Taos Society of Artists.

Crown Prince Leopold attended the opening ceremony.   Located in the Heysel section of the Brussels municipality, it was built to embellish the Heysel plateau in view of the 1935 Brussels International Exposition.   The stadium hosted 70,000 at the time.   A wooden track for cycling races was later added around the pitch. HistoryThe original name was Jubilee Stadium ( ,  ) because it was inaugurated days after Belgium's 100th anniversary, with an unofficial Belgium-Netherlands football match. 

Access control list<====>61589<====>Access control list An access control list (ACL), with respect to a computer file system, is a list of permissions attached to an object.   An ACL specifies which users or system processes are granted access to objects, as well as what operations are allowed on given objects.   Each entry in a typical ACL specifies a subject and an operation.   For instance, if a file object has an ACL that contains  (Alice: read,write; Bob: read) , this would give Alice permission to read and write the file and Bob to only read it. ImplementationsMany kinds of systems implement ACLs, or have a historical implementation.

Echinococcosis<====>61593<====>Echinococcosis    Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease of tapeworms of the Echinococcus type.   The two main types of the disease are cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis.   Less common forms include polycystic echinococcosis and unicystic echinococcosis.   The disease often starts without symptoms and this may last for years.   The symptoms and signs that occur depend on the cyst's location and size.   Alveolar disease usually begins in the liver but can spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs or brain.   When the liver is affected the person may have abdominal pain, weight loss, and turn slightly yellow from jaundice.

Most architecture can be classified as a chronology of styles which changes over time reflecting changing fashions, beliefs and religions, or the emergence of new ideas, technology, or materials which make new styles possible. Styles therefore emerge from the history of a society and are documented in the subject of architectural history.  At any time several styles may be fashionable, and when a style changes it usually does so gradually, as architects learn and adapt to new ideas. 

Halftone<====>61625<====>Halftone Halftone is the reprographic technique that simulates continuous tone imagery through the use of dots, varying either in size or in spacing, thus generating a gradient-like effect.  Campbell, Alastair.  The Designer's Lexicon.  ©2000 Chronicle, San Francisco.   "Halftone" can also be used to refer specifically to the image that is produced by this process.  Where continuous tone imagery contains an infinite range of colors or greys, the halftone process reduces visual reproductions to an image that is printed with only one color of ink, in dots of differing size (amplitude modulation) or spacing (frequency modulation).

Muddy Waters<====>61855<====>Muddy Waters  McKinley Morganfield (April 4, 1913 April 30, 1983),better known as Muddy Waters,  was an American blues musician who is often cited as the "father of modern Chicago blues".    Muddy Waters grew up on Stovall Plantation near Clarksdale, Mississippi, and by age 17 was playing the guitar and the harmonica, emulating the local blues artists Son House and Robert Johnson.  "His thick heavy voice, the dark colouration of his tone, and his firm, almost solid, personality were all clearly derived from House," wrote the music historian Peter Guralnick in Feel Like Going Home, "but the embellishments, which he added, the imaginative slide technique and more agile rhythms, were closer to Johnson. 

Stephen I of Constantinople<====>61856<====>Stephen I of Constantinople Stephen I ( ) (November 867 – 18 May 893) was the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 886 to 893. Born at Constantinople, Stephen was the son of Eudokia Ingerina and, officially, Emperor Basil I.   However, at the time when he was conceived, Eudokia was the mistress of Emperor Michael III.  Consequently, it is possible or even probable that like his older brother Leo VI the Wise, Stephen was Michael's son. Castrated by Basil I, Stephen became a monk and was designated for a career in the church since his childhood.  In 886 his brother, the new Emperor Leo VI, dismissed the Patriarch Photios and appointed the 19-year-old Stephen as patriarch in his stead.

Nicholas Mystikos<====>61858<====>Nicholas Mystikos Nicholas I Mystikos or Nicholas I Mysticus ( , Nikolaos I Mystikos; 852 – 11 May 925) was the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from March 901 to February 907 and from May 912 to his death in 925.  His feast day in the Eastern Orthodox Church is 16 May.  Nicholas was born in the Italian Peninsula and had become a friend of the Patriarch Photios.  He fell into disfavor after Photios' dismissal in 886 and retired to a monastery.  Emperor Leo VI the Wise retrieved him from the monastery and made him mystikos, a dignity designating either the imperial secretary or a judicial official. 

225 BC<====>61860<====>225 BC   Year 225 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Papus and Regulus (or, less frequently, year 529 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 225 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

Theophylact was the youngest son of Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos by Theodora.  Romanos planned to make his son Patriarch as soon as Nicholas Mystikos died in 925, but two minor patriarchates and a two-year vacancy passed before Theophylact was considered old enough to discharge his duties as patriarch (as he was still only sixteen years old).  At this time or before he was castrated to help his career in the church. 

William Grant Stairs<====>61865<====>William Grant Stairs  William Grant Stairs (1 July 1863 – 9 June 1892) was a Canadian-British  explorer, soldier, and adventurer who had a leading role in two of the most controversial expeditions in the history of the colonisation of Africa.

Max Born<====>61866<====>Max Born   Max Born ( ;  ; 11 December 1882 – 5 January 1970) was a German physicist and mathematician who was instrumental in the development of quantum mechanics.  He also made contributions to solid-state physics and optics and supervised the work of a number of notable physicists in the 1920s and 1930s.  Born won the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics for his "fundamental research in quantum mechanics, especially in the statistical interpretation of the wave function".    Born entered the University of Göttingen in 1904, where he found the three renowned mathematicians Felix Klein, David Hilbert, and Hermann Minkowski. 

Trombe wall<====>61867<====>Trombe wall A Trombe wall is a passive solar building design where a wall is built on the winter sun side of a building with a glass external layer and a high heat capacity internal layer separated by a layer of air.  Light close to UV in the electromagnetic spectrum passes through the glass almost unhindered then is absorbed by the wall that then re-radiates in the far infrared spectrum which does not pass back through the glass easily, hence heating the inside of the building.  Trombe walls are commonly used to absorb heat during sunlit hours of winter then slowly release the heat over night. 

Thiomargarita namibiensis<====>61869<====>Thiomargarita namibiensis  Thiomargarita namibiensis is a gram-negative coccoid Proteobacterium, found in the ocean sediments of the continental shelf of Namibia.  It is the largest bacterium ever discovered, as a rule   in diameter, but sometimes attaining  .    Cells of Thiomargarita namibiensis are large enough to be visible to the naked eye.  Although the species holds the record for the most massive bacterium, Epulopiscium fishelsoni – previously discovered in the gut of surgeonfish – grows slightly longer, but narrower. Thiomargarita means "sulfur pearl".  This refers to the appearance of the cells; they contain microscopic sulfur granules that scatter incident light, lending the cell a pearly lustre. 

226 BC<====>61872<====>226 BC   Year 226 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.  At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Messalla and Fullo (or, less frequently, year 528 Ab urbe condita).  The denomination 226 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

Victoria Wood<====>61874<====>Victoria Wood    Victoria Wood,   (19 May 1953 – 20 April 2016) was an English comedienne, actress, singer and songwriter, screenwriter, producer and director.  Wood wrote and starred in dozens of sketches, plays, musicals, films and sitcoms over several decades, and her live comedy act was interspersed with her own compositions, which she performed on the piano.  Much of her humour was grounded in everyday life and included references to quintessentially "British" activities, attitudes and products.  She was noted for her skills in observing culture and in satirising social classes.  Wood started her career in 1974 by appearing on the ATV talent show New Faces. 

Caraș-Severin County<====>61876<====>Caraș-Severin County  Caraș-Severin ( ) is a county (județ) of Romania on the border with Serbia.  The majority of its territory lies within the historical region of Banat, with a few northeastern villages considered part of Transylvania.  The county seat is Reșița.  The Caraș-Severin county is part of the Danube-Kris-Mures-Tisza Euroregion. NameIn Serbian and Croatian, it is known as Karaš Severin/Караш Северин or Karaš-Severinska županija, in Hungarian as Krassó-Szörény megye, in German as Kreis Karasch-Severin, and in Bulgarian as Караш-Северин (translit.  Karash-Severin). DemographicsThe county is part of the Danube-Kris-Mureș-Tisza euroregion. In 2011, it had a population of 274,277 and a population density of 33. 

Reșița<====>61878<====>Reșița    ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) is a city in western Romania and the capital of Caraș-Severin County, in the Banat region.  Its 2011 population was 73,282. EtymologyThe name of Reșița might come from the Latin recitia, meaning "cold spring", as the historian Nicolae Iorga once suggested, presuming that the Romans gave this name to Resita, from a water spring on the Doman valley.  A much more plausibile version, according to Iorgu Iordan, would be that the name is actually coming from a Slavic word: people living in the neighbouring village of Carașova 15 km away, referring to this place, that in those days was a similar village to theirs, as being „u rečice” (at the creek). 

Euphorbia<====>61880<====>Euphorbia  Euphorbia is a very large and diverse genus of flowering plants, commonly called spurge, in the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae).  "Euphorbia" is sometimes used in ordinary English to collectively refer to all members of Euphorbiaceae (in deference to the type genus), not just to members of the genus.   Some euphorbias are commercially widely available, such as poinsettias at Christmas.  Some are commonly cultivated as ornamentals, or collected and highly valued for the aesthetic appearance of their unique floral structures, such as the crown of thorns plant.  Euphorbias from the deserts of Southern Africa and Madagascar have evolved physical characteristics and forms similar to cacti of North and South America, so they (along with various other kinds of plants) are often incorrectly referred to as "cacti". 

Louis XVII of France<====>61881<====>Louis XVII of France  Louis XVII (27 March 1785 – 8 June 1795), born Louis-Charles, was the younger son of King Louis XVI of France and Queen Marie Antoinette.

Division (biology)<====>61889<====>Division (biology) This article discusses categorisations of organisms.  For a different meaning in biology, see cell division. Division is a taxonomic rank in biological classification that is used differently in zoology and in botany. In botany and mycology, division refers to a rank equivalent to phylum.  The use of either term is allowed under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature,    and both are commonly used in scientific literature. The main Divisions of land plants, in the order in which they probably evolved, are the Marchantiophyta (liverworts),  Anthocerotophyta (hornworts), Bryophyta (mosses), Filicophyta (ferns), Sphenophyta (horsetails), Cycadophyta (cycads), Ginkgophyta (ginkgo)s, Pinophyta (conifers), Gnetophyta (gnetophytes), and the Magnoliophyta (Angiosperms, flowering plants). 

Genus (mathematics)<====>61891<====>Genus (mathematics)In mathematics, genus (plural genera) has a few different, but closely related, meanings.  The most common concept, the genus of an (orientable) surface, is the number of "holes" it has.  This is made more precise below. Topology===Orientable surface=== The genus of a connected, orientable surface is an integer representing the maximum number of cuttings along non-intersecting closed simple curves without rendering the resultant manifold disconnected.   It is equal to the number of handles on it.  Alternatively, it can be defined in terms of the Euler characteristic χ, via the relationship χ = 2 − 2g for closed surfaces, where g is the genus. 

Phloem<====>61899<====>PhloemIn vascular plants, phloem (or bast, liber) is the living tissue that transports the soluble organic compounds made during photosynthesis and known as photosynthates, in particular the sugar sucrose,    to parts of the plant where needed.  This transport process is called translocation.   In trees, the phloem is the innermost layer of the bark, hence the name, derived from the Greek word   (phloios) meaning "bark".  The term was introduced by Nägeli in 1858.   Structure Phloem tissue consists of conducting cells, generally called sieve elements, parenchyma cells, including both specialized companion cells or albuminous cells and unspecialized cells and supportive cells, such as fibres and sclereids. 

Muddy Waters discography<====>61903<====>Muddy Waters discography Muddy Waters was an American blues artist widely considered to be one of the most important figures in post–World War II Chicago blues. As with most postwar blues musicians, his recordings were released as two-song singles until the 1960s, when his record company began focusing on long-playing albums.    As a result, his most celebrated recordings from early in his career are issued on various collections and anthologies, often with significant overlap and duplication.Included here are the singles and albums released during Muddy's lifetime and the more notable and current live and compilation albums. 

Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans<====>61904<====>Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans  Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (also known as Sunrise) is a 1927 American silent romantic drama film directed by German director F.  W.  Murnau and starring George O'Brien, Janet Gaynor, and Margaret Livingston.  The story was adapted by Carl Mayer from the short story "The Excursion to Tilsit", from the collection with the same title by Hermann Sudermann.  "The Screen", Mordaunt Hall, The New York Times, September 24, 1927.   "New Pictures: Oct.  3, 1927", Time, October 3, 1927 Murnau chose to use the then new Fox Movietone sound-on-film system, making Sunrise one of the first feature films with a synchronized musical score and sound effects soundtrack.

Climate change and agriculture<====>61910<====>Climate change and agriculture  ]Climate change and agriculture are interrelated processes, both of which take place on a global scale.  Climate change affects agriculture in a number of ways, including through changes in average temperatures, rainfall, and climate extremes (e. g. , heat waves); changes in pests and diseases; changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and ground-level ozone concentrations; changes in the nutritional quality of some foods; and changes in sea level.  Hoffmann, U. , Section B: Agriculture - a key driver and a major victim of global warming, in: Lead Article, in: Chapter 1, in   Climate change is already affecting agriculture, with effects unevenly distributed across the world. 

Maiden and married names<====>61912<====>Maiden and married names  When a person (traditionally the wife in many cultures) assumes the family name of his or her spouse, that name replaces the person's birth surname, which in the case of the wife is called the maiden name (birth name is also used as a gender-neutral or masculine substitute for maiden name), whereas a married name is a family name or surname adopted by a person upon marriage. In some jurisdictions, changing one's name requires a legal procedure.  Nevertheless, in some jurisdictions anyone who either marries or divorces may change his or her name.  Due to increasing security and identification needs, even where it is legal, the common law method is rarely accepted anymore except at marriage (especially for women). 

Château<====>61914<====>Château   A château (plural châteaux;    in both cases ) is a manor house or residence of the lord of the manor or a country house of nobility or gentry, with or without fortifications, originally—and still most frequently—in French-speaking regions.    DefinitionThe word "chateau" is a French word that has entered the English language, where its meaning is more specific than it is in French.  The French word "chateau" denotes buildings as diverse as a medieval fortress, a Renaissance palace and a 19th-century country house.  Care should therefore be taken when translating the French word château into English, noting the nature of the building in question.

During the Green Revolution it was replaced by high yielding alfalfa and clover species.  Due to its anthelmintic properties the common sainfoin is a natural alternative to drugs to control nematode parasitism in the guts of small ruminants.  This is the main reason why O.  viciifolia came back to the scientific agenda during the last years.  Berard N.  C. , Y.  Wang, K.  M.  Wittenberg, D.

Most crime drama focus on crime investigation and does not feature the court room.  An early example of this overlapping form was Erle Stanley Gardner's Perry Mason, in which the eponymous trial lawyer would usually defend his clients from their murder charges by investigating the crime before the trial, and dramatically revealing the actual perpetrator during the closing courtroom scene, by calling some other person to the stand and interrogating him or her into confessing in open court:either of having committed the crimeor of having witnessed the crime being perpetrated by someone other than Mason's client, the defendant.

A number of rivers cross the plateau; notably the Blue Nile rising from Lake Tana.  The plateau gradually slopes to the lowlands of the Sudan on the west and the Somali-inhabited plains to the east. 

French submarine Surcouf<====>62146<====>French submarine Surcouf  }   Surcouf was the largest French submarine cruiser built.  She served during the Second World War.  She was lost during the night of 18/19 February 1942 in the Caribbean Sea, possibly after colliding with an American freighter.  Surcouf was named after the French privateer Robert Surcouf.  She was the largest submarine built until surpassed by the first Japanese   in 1943. DesignThe Washington Naval Treaty had placed strict limits on naval construction by the major naval powers in regards to displacements and artillery calibers of battleships and cruisers.  However, no accords was filed in motion for light ships such as frigates or destroyers or submarines. 

French frigate Surcouf<====>62147<====>French frigate Surcouf  }   Surcouf (F711) is a   of the French Navy.   She was laid down at Lorient Naval Dockyard on 6 July 1992, launched 3 July 1993, and commissioned May 1996.

The catamaran s crew of five were airlifted to safety by helicopter. 

Custard<====>62149<====>Custard   Custard is a variety of culinary preparations based on a cooked mixture of milk or cream and egg yolk.  Depending on how much egg or thickener is used, custard may vary in consistency from a thin pouring sauce (crème anglaise) to a thick pastry cream (French: crème pâtissière) used to fill éclairs.  Most common custards are used as desserts or dessert sauces and typically include sugar and vanilla.  Sometimes flour, corn starch, or gelatin is added as in pastry cream or crème pâtissière. Custard is usually cooked in a double boiler (bain-marie), or heated very gently in a saucepan on a stove, though custard can also be steamed, baked in the oven with or without a water bath, or even cooked in a pressure cooker. 

Soy sauce<====>62153<====>Soy sauce Soy sauce (also called soya sauce in British English)   is a liquid condiment of Chinese origin, made from a fermented paste of soybeans, roasted grain, brine, and Aspergillus oryzae or Aspergillus sojae molds.   Soy sauce in its current form was created about 2,200 years ago during the Western Han dynasty of ancient Chinaand spread throughout East and Southeast Asia where it is used in cooking and as a condiment.  HistoryEast AsiaChinaSoy sauce (酱油) is considered almost as old as soy paste — a type of fermented paste (Jiang, 酱) obtained from soybeans — which had appeared during the Western Han dynasty and was listed in the bamboo slips found in the archaeological site Mawangdui. 

Klez<====>62154<====>Klez  Klez is a computer worm that propagates via e-mail.  It first appeared in October 2001.  A number of variants of the worm exist. Klez infects Microsoft Windows systems, exploiting a vulnerability in Internet Explorer's Trident layout engine, used by both Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express to render HTML mail. The e-mail through which the worm spreads always includes a text portion and one or more attachments.  The text portion consists of either an HTML internal frame tag which causes buggy e-mail clients to automatically execute the worm, or a few lines of text that attempt to induce the recipient to execute the worm by opening the attachment (sometimes by claiming that the attachment is a patch from Microsoft; sometimes by claiming that the attachment is an antidote for the Klez worm). 

Condiment<====>62155<====>Condiment A condiment is a spice, sauce, or preparation that is added to food to impart a particular flavor, to enhance its flavor,  or in some cultures, to complement the dish.  The term originally described pickled or preserved foods, but has shifted meaning over time.  Many condiments are available packaged in single-serving packets, like mustard or ketchup, particularly when supplied with take-out or fast-food meals.  They are usually applied by the diner, but are sometimes added prior to serving; for example, in a sandwich made with ketchup, mustard or mayonnaise.  Some condiments are used during cooking to add flavor or texture to the food; barbecue sauce, compound butter, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, and marmite are examples. 

Convolvulaceae<====>62158<====>Convolvulaceae  Convolvulaceae, known commonly as the bindweed or morning glory family, is a family of about 60 genera and more than 1,650 species of mostly herbaceous vines, but also trees, shrubs and herbs. DescriptionConvolvulaceae can be recognized by their funnel-shaped, radially symmetrical corolla; the floral formula for the family has five sepals, five fused petals, five epipetalous stamens (stamens fused to the petals), and a two-part syncarpous and superior gynoecium.  The stems of these plants are usually winding, hence their Latin name (from convolvere, "to wind").  The leaves are simple and alternate, without stipules.  In parasitic Cuscuta they are reduced to scales. 

Kwe people<====>62161<====>Kwe peopleKWE redirects here.  KWE is also the IATA airport code of Guiyang Longdongbao Airport, and KWE is also an acronym for the South African skin disease Keratolytic winter erythema.  The Bakweri (or Kwe) are an ethnic group of the Republic of Cameroon.  They are closely related to Cameroon's coastal peoples (the Sawa), particularly the Duala and Isubu. HistoryEarly population movementsAccording to Bakweri oral traditions, that they originated from Mboko, the area southwest of Mount Cameroon.   The Bakweri likely migrated to their present home east of the mountain in the mid-18th century.  From the foothills, they gradually spread to the coast, and up the Mungo River and the various creeks that empty into it. 

Rotifer<====>62166<====>Rotifer The rotifers (Rotifera, commonly called wheel animals) make up a phylum of microscopic and near-microscopic pseudocoelomate animals. They were first described by Rev.  John Harris in 1696, and other forms were described by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1703.Most rotifers are around 0. 1–0. 5 mm long (although their size can range from 50 μm to over 2 mm),  and are common in freshwater environments throughout the world with a few saltwater species; for example, those of genus Synchaeta. Some rotifers are free swimming and truly planktonic, others move by inchworming along a substrate, and some are sessile, living inside tubes or gelatinous holdfasts that are attached to a substrate. 

Trifle<====>62168<====>Trifle  Trifle in English cuisine is a dessert made with fruit, a thin layer of sponge fingers soaked in sherry or another fortified wine, and custard.  It can be topped with whipped cream.  The fruit and sponge layers may be suspended in fruit-flavoured jelly, and these ingredients are usually arranged to produce three or four layers.  The contents of a trifle are highly variable; many varieties exist, some forgoing fruit entirely and instead using other ingredients such as chocolate, coffee or vanilla. The name trifle was used for a dessert like a fruit fool in the sixteenth century; by the eighteenth century, Hannah Glasse records a recognisably modern trifle, with the inclusion of a gelatin jelly sometimes found in salami. 

Gore Vidal<====>62169<====>Gore Vidal  Eugene Luther Gore Vidal (  born Eugene Louis Vidal; October 3, 1925 – July 31, 2012) was an American writer and public intellectual known for his patrician manner, epigrammatic wit, and polished style of writing.   Vidal was born to a political family; his maternal grandfather, Thomas Pryor Gore, served as United States senator from Oklahoma (1907–1921 and 1931–1937).

Crinoid<====>62175<====>Crinoid Crinoids are marine animals that make up the class Crinoidea of the echinoderms (phylum Echinodermata).  The name comes from the Greek word krinon, "a lily", and eidos, "form". They live in both shallow water    and in depths as great as  .Those crinoids which in their adult form are attached to the sea bottom by a stalk are commonly called sea lilies.   The unstalked forms are called feather stars  or comatulids.    Crinoids are characterised by a mouth on the top surface that is surrounded by feeding arms. 

Graptolithina<====>62177<====>Graptolithina  Graptolithina is a subclass of the class Pterobranchia, the members of which are known as graptolites.  These organisms are colonial animals known chiefly as fossils from the Middle Cambrian (Series 3, Stage 5) through the Lower Carboniferous (Mississippian)   Maletz, J.  (2014) The classification of the Pterobranchia (Cephalodiscida and Graptolithina).  Bulletin of Geosciences, 89(3):477–540  .  A possible early graptolite, Chaunograptus, is known from the Middle Cambrian  .  One analysis suggests that the pterobranch Rhabdopleura represents extant graptolites  .  Studies on the tubarium of fossil and living graptolites showed similarities in the basic fusellar construction and it is considered that the group most probably evolved from a Rhabdopleura-like ancestor  .

Bilateria<====>62187<====>Bilateria The Bilateria   or bilaterians, or triploblasts, are animals with bilateral symmetry, i. e. , they have a head ("anterior") and a tail ("posterior") as well as a back ("dorsal") and a belly ("ventral"); therefore they also have a left side and a right side.  In contrast, radially symmetrical animals like jellyfish have a topside and a downside, but no identifiable front or back.  The bilateria are a major group of animals, including the majority of phyla but not sponges, cnidarians, placozoans and ctenophores.  For the most part, bilateral embryos are triploblastic, having three germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm.

In December 2015, it was recognized as one of four new elements by the Joint Working Party of international scientific bodies IUPAC and IUPAP.  It was formally named on 28 November 2016.    The name is in line with the tradition of honoring a scientist and recognizes nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, who has played a leading role in the discovery of the heaviest elements in the periodic table. 

Philadelphia Experiment<====>62204<====>Philadelphia Experiment  The Philadelphia Experiment is an alleged military experiment supposed to have been carried out by the U. S.  Navy at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, sometime around October 28, 1943.  The U. S.  Navy destroyer escort   was claimed to have been rendered invisible (or "cloaked") to enemy devices. The story first appeared in 1955, in letters of unknown origin sent to a writer and astronomer, Morris K.  Jessup.  It is widely understood to be a hoax; the U. S.  Navy maintains that no such experiment was ever conducted, that the alleged details of the story contradict well-established facts about USS Eldridge, and that the claims do not conform to known physical laws.
